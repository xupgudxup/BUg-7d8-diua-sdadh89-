    "fullText": "GAZA CITY (AP) — On a rare day off from covering the war in Gaza, Associated Press photographer Jehad Alshrafi made sure to take his camera before heading out.\n\nSo when the Israeli military ordered the evacuation of people living near a Gaza City intersection Friday afternoon and warned of an impending airstrike, Alshrafi was ready.\n\nHis photos capture the staggering impact of an Israeli bomb in split-second detail.\n\nIn a post on social media, an Israeli military spokesman identified the target as a building used by Hamas militants. Warned to keep back at least 300 meters (about 980 feet), Alshrafi headed for a cemetery with a view of the site.\n\n“I saw the evacuation order on the internet and went directly to the place,” Alshrafi said.\n\nIt’s common for people in Gaza to visit cemeteries on Friday to pay respect to lost family members. With space between the headstones busy with mourners, Alshrafi set up at the far end of the cemetery, “because I know that sometimes the explosions are very strong, so we need to always stay vigilant.”\n\nHis images reinforce that very real danger. In the first, an Israeli bomb is frozen in midair, just a few feet from striking its target, as cemetery visitors turn to flee.\n\nIn the frames that follow, an immense plume of flames and smoke erupts from the structure. Debris sprays skyward. The building staggers before collapsing on itself.\n\nThe experience of bearing witness and the images it produced are searing. “The explosion was loud and strong beyond imagination,” Alshrafi said. “It was incredibly violent.”\n\nThis is a photo gallery curated by AP photo editors.",

    "description": "The fighter, built for war with Russia, is set to be one of the three main pillars of Ukraine's future air force.",
    "fullText": "Swedish defense prime Saab is exploring the Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System as a cheaper armament option for its JAS 39 Gripen fighters, firm executives told Business Insider this week.\n\n\"The APKWS is in interest because other platforms are now integrating 70mm guided rockets. So we are, of course, eyeing that capability now,\" Jussi Halmetoja, operations advisor for Saab's air domain, said at the Singapore Airshow.\n\nHalmetoja said the company was looking at ways to integrate the weapons system, which uses a guided version of the Hydra 70mm rocket, onto its older Gripen C and latest Gripen E models.\n\nHe made the comments as he and Mikael Franzên, chief marketing officer for the Gripen program, discussed the company's observation from the Ukraine war that it needs more inexpensive weapons to counter uncrewed aerial systems.\n\n\"I mean, right now we are using very expensive weapons to kill very cheap drones,\" Franzén said of traditional Western air combat.\n\nHe added that Saab is hoping to potentially equip the Gripen with systems that can fit multiple munitions onto a single hardpoint.\n\n\"If you can have four or 10 on each hardpoint, then you can kill a lot more drones,\" Franzên said. The APWKS is typically mounted on aircraft with multilaunch pods.\n\nKyiv has signed a letter of intent with Sweden to potentially acquire up to 150 Gripen E fighters in the coming years. Ukraine's air force has yet to fly the jet, which is touted as an ideal fighter for battling Russia because it's built to operate from dispersed, rugged airfields and in the Arctic domain.\n\nKyiv is now flying much of its small fleet of F-16 Fighting Falcons from such small airfields, often moving the aircraft to increase their survivability.\n\nBut Franzén and Halmetoja said the Gripen can turn around much faster from dispersed airfields and be ready for a new mission within 10 minutes of landing.\n\nSweden, South Africa, Brazil, Thailand, Czechia, and Hungary are among the countries that fly the Gripen.\n\nThe APWKS, meanwhile, is already being deployed across various systems in Ukraine.\n\nFor example, the VAMPIRE counter-UAS systems feature a four-barrel launcher for the guided Hydra rockets that can be mounted on a pickup truck.\n\nThe cost of using one APKWS round is estimated at $20,000 to $35,000, compared to weapons more typically associated with modern fighters, such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder, which costs roughly $450,000, and the AIM-120 AMRAAM, which costs roughly $1 million.\n\nConcerns about missile costs against cheaper drones have risen steadily since the war began, and as Russia has continuously grown its loitering munitions mass manufacturing.\n\nOutside Ukraine, the US military has also been using the APWKS to recently fight drone attacks in the Middle East. The weapons system, loaded on American F-16s and F-15s, was responsible for roughly 40% of the drone kills scored by US forces against Houthi drones during last year's Operation Rough Rider.",

    "description": "The USS Massachusetts, known for its pivotal role in World War II, is now a museum and war memorial in Massachusetts.",
    "fullText": "The USS Massachusetts fired America's first 16-inch shell of World War II. It also fired the last.\n\nIn 1942, the 680-foot battleship fired the first US 16-inch projectile of the war in combat with French forces off the coast of Casablanca, Morocco, as part of Operation Torch. Three years later, the USS Massachusetts fired the last 16-inch projectile of World War II against Japanese forces in the final naval bombardment in Kamaishi, Honshu, Japan.\n\nAfter the war, the decorated battleship was decommissioned and destined to become scrap metal until its former crew members stepped in to raise the funds to save it.\n\nIn 1965, the USS Massachusetts opened to the public as a museum and war memorial in the very state it was named for.\n\n\"The most important function here is that we serve to honor veterans and active duty personnel,\" Christopher Nardi, Battleship Cove's chief operating officer, told Business Insider.\n\nTake a look inside the USS Massachusetts.\n\nThe USS Massachusetts was one of four battleships built as part of the South Dakota class, which was designed to be more compact than previous battleship classes.\n\nI visited Battleship Cove in January, when the museum operates with limited winter hours due to the frigid temperatures on board the ships. The full list of hours of operation can be found on Battleship Cove's website.\n\nGeneral admission costs $25 per adult.\n\nThe ship weighed 44,519 tons when fully loaded for combat.\n\nThe Below Deck tour takes visitors through the inner workings of the ship's technology, including the engine room, the gun plotting and handling rooms, and the radio room.\n\nThe World War II-focused tour features historical exhibits about the war as a whole and spotlights some of the battle damage the ship endured.\n\nThe Crew tour brings visitors through spaces that were part of the sailors' daily life on board, such as their bunks, galley, and laundry room.\n\nThe Topside tour explores the deck of the ship, including its many guns.\n\nColor-coded arrows direct visitors along each of the routes.\n\nThe ship has a total of nine 16-inch, 45-caliber Mark 6 guns: two three-gun turrets at the front of the ship (\"forward\") and one three-gun turret at the back (\"aft\"). They could hit targets up to 23 miles away.\n\nThe 16-inch measurement refers to the bore diameter, or the size of the hole that the shell is fired through. The cannons themselves are over 60 feet long.\n\nThe Bofors 40-millimeter guns featured a range of 6.25 miles and could fire between 120 and 160 rounds per minute.\n\nAt the height of World War II, the USS Massachusetts was outfitted with 72 40-millimeter guns.\n\nThe 20-millimeter Oerlikon autocannons featured a range of 2.75 miles.\n\nSome of the ship's 5-inch guns still work and are used for ceremonial gun salutes.\n\nIf you look closely, you can see the seagull that decided to perch on one of the guns when I visited.\n\nEach nautical flag represents a letter or signal. For example, the flag representing the letter \"O\" can also mean \"man overboard.\"\n\nCrew members opened and closed the light's shutter to send messages in Morse code.\n\nWhen the ship was deployed, officers would have eaten their meals here off fine china.\n\nThe wardroom still features tables and seating for large groups.\n\nIn addition to functioning as a museum, Battleship Cove is the official World War II memorial for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\nDuring World War II, the crew of the USS Massachusetts grew from its normal number of 1,793 enlisted men to 2,500. When the berthing rooms were full, the ship set up hammocks in other areas.\n\nOfficers were in charge of censoring crew members' letters to their loved ones, blacking out information like their location or even the weather.\n\nDuring the war, maintenance had to be performed while the ship was in the middle of the ocean.\n\nToday, museum volunteers use 3D printers to create replacement parts.\n\nThe galley prepared four meals per day: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and midnight rations known as \"mid-rats.\"\n\nSailors labeled every item of their clothing, but some items still ended up in the lost-and-found, known as the \"lucky bag.\"\n\nIn the brig, sailors received only bread and water for meals.\n\nDuring the Battle of Casablanca in 1942, an 8-inch projectile hit the main deck and exploded in a bunk room. No one was injured since all of the sailors were at their battle stations, but the ship sustained damage from the shrapnel.\n\nThe holes have since been repaired, but red outlines on the walls show where they once were.\n\nThe sick bay treated battle wounds as well as everyday ailments such as ear infections or athlete's foot.\n\nOn Iowa-class battleships like the USS New Jersey, Broadway is the longest, straightest passageway on the ship. On South Dakota-class battleships like the USS Massachusetts, Broadway is thinner and not built in a straight line since the class was designed to be more compact.\n\nGunner's mates loaded shells and powder cases into the hoists, which moved them up to the upper handling room and then up to the gun mounts.\n\nSix powder bags were required to fire one 16-inch projectile.\n\nThe USS Massachusetts could hold over 1,200 projectiles.\n\nA device called a Mark 8 Rangekeeper computed where to aim the 16-inch guns based on factors such as the ship's course and speed and the direction of the wind.\n\nIn order to work in the distribution room, an electrician had to pass a test showing that he could get from his bunk to the distribution room and identify any circuit while blindfolded.\n\nRadiomen were responsible for typing messages and passing them to supervisors.\n\nNardi told Business Insider that the equipment in radio central is still operational thanks to the work of volunteers who continue to maintain it.\n\nCanvas bags with lead bottoms were kept in the code room just in case any top-secret information had to be thrown overboard if the ship was compromised.\n\nEven with a map of the ship and color-coded arrows pointing the way, touring the USS Massachusetts was a dizzying experience full of ladders, hatches, and tight corners. On a battleship that big, there's an endless amount of history to learn.\n\nNardi told me that touring historic battleships like the USS Massachusetts can provide insight into how modern Navy ships operate.\n\nBasic navigational equipment looks and works largely the same as it did on World War II battleships, Nardi said. Some communication devices, such as sound-powered telephones that harness the electricity generated by the user's voice, are also still widely used.\n\n\"I hear Navy personnel come on board and say, 'Oh, that hasn't changed much,'\" Nardi said.\n\nIn December, Trump announced a new \"Trump-class\" of ships, referring to them as \"battleships,\" as part of his plan for the US Navy's new \"Golden Fleet\" to reinvigorate American shipbuilding. White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly previously told Business Insider that Trump is \"prioritizing this vital industry to strengthen our country's economic and national security.\"\n\nHowever, the Trump-class ships would not technically qualify as battleships. To earn that title, they would have to be the largest, most heavily armored ships with the largest guns relative to other ships.\n\n\"The word 'battleship' can be used very generically, which is not accurate. We don't have them anymore, and President Trump's not going to build battleships. He's calling them that, but a battleship is what we have over here,\" Nardi said, gesturing at the USS Massachusetts floating in the Taunton River. \"That's a real battleship.\"",

    "fullText": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Russian missiles and drones have pounded Ukraine’s energy grid in recent weeks, plunging people into frozen darkness in one of the country’s coldest winters on record.\n\nUkraine has accused Russia of illegally targeting power infrastructure during the war to deny civilians light, heating and running water.\n\n\"Taking advantage of the coldest days of winter to terrorize people is more important to Russia than diplomacy,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday, on the eve of a new round of talks about ending the conflict and as temperatures in Kyiv hovered around minus 20 C (minus 3 F).\n\nRussia says its attacks are a legitimate part of its military campaign against its neighbor. Moscow's invasion of Ukraine itself is widely regarded as an illegal act of aggression.\n\nSo, are attacks on energy installations allowed during war?\n\nCombatants can legally target a power grid if the attack “directly affects a valid military target” — but they cannot cause excessive civilian casualties, said David Crane, former chief prosecutor at the United Nations Special Court for Sierra Leone.\n\nIn the case of Russia's attacks on Ukraine, “the indiscriminate and widespread targeting does not come close to what is legal,” he said in an emailed response to questions from The Associated Press.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross says that parts of energy systems providing essential services to civilians “are in principle civilian objects, and as such are protected against direct attack and reprisals as well as incidental harm.”\n\nPretrial judges from the International Criminal Court, in fact, issued arrest warrants in 2024 for top Russian military brass and the country’s former defense minister for their alleged involvement in missile strikes targeting electricity infrastructure.\n\nIn announcing warrants for former Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Russia’s chief military officer, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the court said that judges found “reasonable grounds to believe that the alleged strikes were directed against civilian objects, and for those installations that may have qualified as military objectives at the relevant time, the expected incidental civilian harm and damage would have been clearly excessive to the anticipated military advantage.”\n\nRussia is not a member of the court, rejects its jurisdiction, and refuses to extradite suspects to face justice in the ICC’s courtrooms in The Hague, Netherlands.\n\nThe Russian military has repeatedly said that it has targeted energy facilities and other infrastructure that support Ukrainian military industries and armed forces. It has denied targeting residential areas despite daily evidence to the contrary.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted Wednesday that “our military is striking the targets that they believe are associated with the military complex of the Kyiv regime, the operation is continuing.”\n\nKyiv accuses Russia of seeking to wear down Ukrainians’ appetite for the fight by inflicting grinding hardship on civilians forced to live in dark, freezing homes.\n\nAuthorities say Russia has tried to cripple Ukraine's electricity network by targeting substations, transformers, turbines and generators at power plants. Ukraine’s largest private power company, DTEK, said that this week's overnight attack was the ninth major assault on the company’s thermal power plants since October.\n\nUkraine’s energy sector has suffered more than $20 billion in direct war damage, according to a joint estimate by the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations.",

    "fullText": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes pounded Gaza on Wednesday, killing at least 21 Palestinians, including two infants, and further rocking a fragile ceasefire deal, hospital officials said. Israel said it was responding to a militant attack on Israeli soldiers that seriously wounded one.\n\nDeadly Israeli strikes have repeatedly punctuated the truce since it came into effect on Oct. 10, and the escalating Palestinian toll has made many in Gaza say it feels like the war is continuing unabated. Among the Palestinians killed Wednesday were five children, seven women and an on-duty paramedic, according to hospital officials.\n\n“The genocidal war against our people in the Gaza Strip continues,” said Dr. Mohamed Abu Selmiya, director of Gaza City’s Shifa Hospital, in a Facebook post. “Where is the ceasefire? Where are the mediators?”\n\nIsrael strongly denies accusations that it is committing genocide in Gaza. The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when thousands of Hamas-led militants poured into southern Israel after a surprise barrage of rockets, killing 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and abducting 251.\n\nDeadly strikes have continued despite ceasefire deal\n\nThe deal attempted to halt the more than 2-year-old war between Israel and Hamas. While the heaviest fighting has subsided, it has been marred by repeated flareups of violence.\n\nA total of 556 Palestinians have been killed by Israel and 1,500 wounded since the ceasefire went into effect, according to Gaza health officials, while Israel's military says four Israeli soldiers have been killed.\n\nIsrael’s military has said its continuing strikes are responses to Hamas violations or militant attacks on its soldiers, but dozens of civilians have died. Eight Arab and Muslim countries, including mediators Egypt and Qatar, recently condemned what they called Israel’s “repeated violations” of the deal.\n\nAn Israeli military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in line with military policy, told The Associated Press that Israel's latest attacks were in response to militant gunfire that badly wounded a reservist soldier Wednesday morning.\n\nEarly morning strike kills 11, including two children\n\nIsraeli troops fired on a building in the Tuffah neighborhood in north Gaza, killing at least 11 people, most from the same family, said Shifa Hospital, which received the bodies. The dead included two parents, their 10-day-old girl Wateen Khabbaz, her 5-month-old cousin, Mira Khabbaz, and the children's grandmother.\n\nMourners gathered in the courtyard of Shifa hospital Wednesday morning for funeral prayers.\n\n“What did this child do? …. Why are they killing the children?\" asked a relative of the family, Mohammad Jaser.\n\n“We don’t understand why this is happening to us. What do we do? Where do we go? This isn’t life,” he said.\n\nTwo young children were seen kneeling at the body of their father as a woman told them to bid him farewell. A young girl kissed her father's cheeks.\n\nStrikes on Gaza continue into Wednesday afternoon\n\nLater, an Israeli strike on a family’s tent in the southern city of Khan Younis killed three people including a 12-year-old boy, said Nasser Hospital, which received the bodies.\n\nA strike on a tent in the Muwasi area of Khan Younis killed at least two people and wounded five others, according to a field hospital run by the Palestinian Red Crescent in the area. The dead included Hussein Hassan Hussein al-Semieri, a paramedic who was on duty at the time, said the hospital.\n\nThirty-eight Palestinians were wounded in total by the strikes Wednesday, the Gaza health ministry said.\n\nPassage through Rafah border is minimal\n\nThe Rafah border crossing’s opening Monday was hailed as a step forward for the fragile ceasefire. But since then, Palestinian passage through the crossing has been marred by delays, interrogations and uncertainty over who would be allowed to cross.\n\nIt took the entire day Tuesday for 40 Palestinians to enter Gaza. Around 1 a.m. Wednesday, they finally arrived at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, where their families welcomed them. By midday Wednesday, no one else had passed through the crossing.\n\nDespite no traffic, a European Union official said the Rafah border crossing was open. An EU mission and Palestinian workers were present at the crossing. The official, tasked with communicating for the EU, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to be named.\n\nThree women who crossed into Gaza on Monday told The Associated Press a day later that Israeli troops blindfolded and handcuffed them, then interrogated and threatened them, holding them for several hours before they were released.\n\nThe EU official said that the border mission had no knowledge of luggage confiscation or mistreatment by Israeli soldiers or Palestinians in the border areas.\n\nAsked about the reports, the Israeli military said that “no incidents of inappropriate conduct, mistreatment, apprehensions, or confiscation of property by the Israeli security establishment are known.”\n\nWhile all fighting has not stopped, some parts of the ceasefire deal have moved forward.\n\nHamas has released all of the hostages it was holding, and in return Israel has released several thousand Palestinians and is beginning to reopen Rafah. Increased amounts of humanitarian aid have flowed into Gaza and a new technocratic committee has been appointed to administer the territory's daily affairs.\n\nBut other key elements of the ceasefire appear to have stalled, including the deployment of an international security force, the disarmament of Hamas and the reconstruction of Gaza. The U.S. has given no timeline on when these parts of the deal will wrap up.\n\nOver 71,800 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Gaza health ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians. The ministry, which is part of the Hamas-led government, maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts.\n\nMagdy reported from Cairo and Frankel from Jerusalem.

    "description": "BBC Sport finds evidence raising questions over the neutral eligibility of four Russian athletes.",
    "fullText": "Several Russian athletes approved to compete as neutrals at the Winter Olympics have links to activity supporting the war in Ukraine, according to evidence seen by BBC Sport.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee has cleared 13 competitors, external from Russia to participate as Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs) in Milan-Cortina.\n\nTheir eligibility was assessed by a three-person IOC panel, external, with athletes deemed ineligible if they were found to have actively supported the war, including through social media activity or participation in pro-war events.\n\nHowever, material shared with the BBC by the Molfar Intelligence Institute, external and investigative journalist Artem Khudolieiev raises questions over whether some of those approved meet the IOC's broadly-framed criteria.\n\nMeanwhile, one member of the panel - Morinari Watanabe - was filmed embracing a Russian gymnast sanctioned for his involvement with Russia's war effort during a visit to Moscow in March, prompting further questions about the vetting process.\n\nUkraine's flag-bearer for the opening ceremony believes the IOC should review its neutral eligibility framework.\n\n\"Getting ready for competition in occupied territories, or supporting the war on social media, it is definitely not right to call them neutral because they're not,\" said skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych.\n\nThe IOC said it could not comment on individual cases but that the panel had \"reviewed the athletes in accordance with the executive board decision and the principles it had established\".\n\nRussians and Belarusians cleared for Winter Olympics\n\n'Russians & Belarusians should compete in qualifiers'\n\nBBC Sport has verified the following evidence relating to four individuals cleared to compete as neutrals:\n\nPetr Gumennik (figure skating) - Gumennik has recently worked with and been coached by Ilya Averbukh, who has been sanctioned by Ukraine, external. Averbukh has held the role of 'Crimea's ambassador for sport', taken part in events in numerous occupied territories and staged performances for families of Russian soldiers.\n\nSavelii Korostelev (cross-country skiing) - Korostelev liked pro-Putin and pro-military content posted on Instagram by fellow skier Veronika Stepanova. He was also described as a \"private\" and an \"army skier\" in a 2023 article published by his club, CSKA, which is affiliated with the Russian armed forces.\n\nKseniia Korzhova (speed skating) - Korzhova liked pro-war content on Instagram from gymnast Nikita Nagorny, who has been sanctioned by the UK, external and European Union, external for his prominent role with the Russian army.\n\nDariya Nepryaeva (cross-country skiing) - Nepryaeva attended a ski team training camp in Crimea in 2022, months after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began. Crimea was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014 and is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine. The camp was filmed and broadcast by a state-backed television channel.\n\nUkraine's Olympic Committee has written to the IOC to raise concerns about Gumennik and Korzhova.\n\nNone of the athletes named responded to BBC Sport's requests for comment.\n\nRussia's Sports Minister, Mikhail Degtyarev, has previously said that \"athletes are not responsible for relations between countries or for governmental decisions and according to the Olympic Charter they should have the right to compete\".\n\nSeparate reporting, external has suggested that Korostelev may have been completing compulsory military service, rather than voluntarily joining the army.\n\nThe final decision on whether the four athletes could compete in Milan-Cortina was taken by the IOC's Individual Neutral Athlete Eligibility Review Panel.\n\nWatanabe sits on the panel as the representative of international sports federations, by virtue of his role as president of World Gymnastics. He was also a candidate in last year's IOC presidential election.\n\nIn March 2025, Watanabe was filmed embracing Nagorny during a visit to Moscow.\n\nNagorny, an Olympic gold medallist at the Tokyo Games, has been a prominent supporter of Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nHe served as head of Yunarmiya, Russia's youth military organisation, between 2020 and 2024 and has been sanctioned by the UK, European Union and United States, external.\n\nThe UK sanctions notice accuses Nagorny of involvement in the forced deportation and re-education of Ukrainian children.\n\n\"It’s crazy,\" said Heraskevych, who held up a ‘No War’ sign at the Beijing Games.\n\n\"He's still hugging this person and still friendly with him. And then he decides whether these Russians are guilty or not guilty, whether they are engaged in the war or not.\"\n\nWorld Gymnastics, responding on behalf of Watanabe, said it would not comment on the IOC panel or its decisions.\n\nIt said Watanabe's visit to Russia \"took place a few days after he visited Ukraine\" and that its purpose \"was to show support to athletes affected by the war, on both sides\".\n\n\"Mr Nagorny has not been allowed to participate in World Gymnastics competitions since the beginning of the conflict,\" it added.\n\nDuring Watanabe's tenure as head of World Gymnastics, Russian athletes have also been allowed to return to international competition under neutral status in his sport.\n\nThat includes Angelina Melnikova, who was controversially cleared to compete last year despite previously posing with the pro-war 'Z' symbol and standing in local elections for Vladimir Putin's United Russia party.\n\nWorld Gymnastics said decisions regarding its Individual Neutral Athlete status are made \"by an independent ad hoc committee, following background checks conducted by an external company\".\n\nRussia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began just four days after the end of the last Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n\nAt those Games, 209 Russians competed under the name of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) because of sanctions linked to a state-sponsored doping scandal. They finished second in the medal table, winning 32 medals including five gold.\n\nSince the invasion, athletes holding Russian or Belarusian passports have been barred from many international sports competitions.\n\nBut the IOC has created a pathway for individuals to compete as neutrals, provided they meet strict criteria.\n\nThat framework was first applied at Paris 2024, where 32 competitors from Russia and Belarus took part as AINs.\n\nTo be eligible, they had to show they had not actively supported the war and were not contracted to the military. They competed without national flags or anthems.\n\nThe same conditions apply in Milan-Cortina. Thirteen Russians and seven Belarusians have been approved across eight sports. Team events such as ice hockey and curling remain off limits.\n\nThe IOC says every neutral competitor must also be cleared by their international federation.\n\nSome bodies, including the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS), attempted to exclude neutrals altogether but that position was overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in December, a ruling that came too late for many athletes to qualify.",

    "description": "Anthropic explains why Claude will remain ad-free—how advertising incentives conflict with building a genuinely helpful AI assistant users can trust.",
    "fullText": "There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them.\n\nAdvertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We’ve run our own ad campaigns, and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry.\n\nBut including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.\n\nWe want Claude to act unambiguously in our users’ interests. So we’ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free. Our users won’t see “sponsored” links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude’s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for.\n\nWhen people use search engines or social media, they’ve come to expect a mixture of organic and sponsored content. Filtering signal from noise is part of the interaction.\n\nConversations with AI assistants are meaningfully different. The format is open-ended; users often share context and reveal more than they would in a search query. This openness is part of what makes conversations with AI valuable, but it’s also what makes them susceptible to influence in ways that other digital products are not.\n\nOur analysis of conversations with Claude (conducted in a way that keeps all data private and anonymous) shows that an appreciable portion involve topics that are sensitive or deeply personal—the kinds of conversations you might have with a trusted advisor. Many other uses involve complex software engineering tasks, deep work, or thinking through difficult problems. The appearance of ads in these contexts would feel incongruous—and, in many cases, inappropriate.\n\nWe still have much to learn about the impact of AI models on the people who use them. Early research suggests both benefits—like people finding support they couldn’t access elsewhere—and risks, including the potential for models to reinforce harmful beliefs in vulnerable users. Introducing advertising incentives at this stage would add another level of complexity. Our understanding of how models translate the goals we set them into specific behaviors is still developing; an ad-based system could therefore have unpredictable results.\n\nBeing genuinely helpful is one of the core principles of Claude’s Constitution, the document that describes our vision for Claude’s character and guides how we train the model. An advertising-based business model would introduce incentives that could work against this principle.\n\nConsider a concrete example. A user mentions they’re having trouble sleeping. An assistant without advertising incentives would explore the various potential causes—stress, environment, habits, and so on—based on what might be most insightful to the user. An ad-supported assistant has an additional consideration: whether the conversation presents an opportunity to make a transaction. These objectives may often align—but not always. And, unlike a list of search results, ads that influence a model’s responses may make it difficult to tell whether a given recommendation comes with a commercial motive or not. Users shouldn’t have to second-guess whether an AI is genuinely helping them or subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable.\n\nEven ads that don’t directly influence an AI model’s responses and instead appear separately within the chat window would compromise what we want Claude to be: a clear space to think and work. Such ads would also introduce an incentive to optimize for engagement—for the amount of time people spend using Claude and how often they return. These metrics aren’t necessarily aligned with being genuinely helpful. The most useful AI interaction might be a short one, or one that resolves the user’s request without prompting further conversation.\n\nWe recognize that not all advertising implementations are equivalent. More transparent or opt-in approaches—where users explicitly choose to see sponsored content—might avoid some of the concerns outlined above. But the history of ad-supported products suggests that advertising incentives, once introduced, tend to expand over time as they become integrated into revenue targets and product development, blurring boundaries that were once more clear-cut. We’ve chosen not to introduce these dynamics into Claude.\n\nAnthropic is focused on businesses, developers, and helping our users flourish. Our business model is straightforward: we generate revenue through enterprise contracts and paid subscriptions, and we reinvest that revenue into improving Claude for our users. This is a choice with tradeoffs, and we respect that other AI companies might reasonably reach different conclusions.\n\nExpanding access to Claude is central to our public benefit mission, and we want to do it without selling our users’ attention or data to advertisers. To that end, we’ve brought AI tools and training to educators in over 60 countries, begun national AI education pilots with multiple governments, and made Claude available to nonprofits at a significant discount. We continue to invest in our smaller models so that our free offering remains at the frontier of intelligence, and we may consider lower-cost subscription tiers and regional pricing where there is clear demand for it. Should we need to revisit this approach, we’ll be transparent about our reasons for doing so.\n\nAI will increasingly interact with commerce, and we look forward to supporting this in ways that help our users. We’re particularly interested in the potential of agentic commerce, where Claude acts on a user’s behalf to handle a purchase or booking end to end. And we’ll continue to build features that enable our users to find, compare, or buy products, connect with businesses, and more—when they choose to do so.\n\nWe’re also exploring more ways to make Claude a focused space to be at your most productive. Users can already connect third-party tools they use for work—like Figma, Asana, and Canva—and interact with them directly within Claude. We expect to introduce many more useful integrations and expand this toolkit over time.\n\nAll third-party interactions will be grounded in the same overarching design principle: they should be initiated by the user (where the AI is working for them) rather than an advertiser (where the AI is working, at least in part, for someone else). Today, whether someone asks Claude to research running shoes, compare mortgage rates, or recommend a restaurant for a special occasion, Claude’s only incentive is to give a helpful answer. We’d like to preserve that.\n\nWe want our users to trust Claude to help them keep thinking—about their work, their challenges, and their ideas.\n\nOur experience of using the internet has made it easy to assume that advertising on the products we use is inevitable. But open a notebook, pick up a well-crafted tool, or stand in front of a clean chalkboard, and there are no ads in sight.\n\nWe think Claude should work the same way.",

    "description": "Are LLMs the final blow in the war against Wirth's law?",
    "fullText": "In 1995, Turing laureate Niklaus Wirth wrote an essay called A Plea for Lean Software in which he mostly gripes about the state of software at the time. Among these gripes is this claim which Wirth attributes to his colleague Martin Reiser1, though it's become to be known as Wirth's Law:\n\nSoftware is getting slower more rapidly than hardware becomes faster.\n\nDoing his best grandpa Simpson impersonation, Wirth complains:\n\nAbout 25 years ago, an interactive text editor could be designed with as\nlittle as 8,000 bytes ofstorage. (Modern program editors request 100 times\nthat much!) An operating system had to manage with 8,000 bytes, and a\ncompiler had to fit into 32 Kbytes, whereas their modern descendants\nrequire megabytes. Has all this inflated software become any faster? On\nthe contrary. Were it not for a thousand times faster hardware, modern\nsoftware would be utterly unusable.\n\nAside from the numbers involved here, which must sound utterly preposterous to the average modern reader, there's a lot to relate to. My 25 year career in software, all of which happened after 1995, was in many ways a story in two parts about Wirth's Law, an action and a reaction.\n\nPersonally, I disagree with Wirth's conclusion that nothing of value had been gained for the loss in efficiency. When he laments \"the advent of windows, cut-and-paste strategies, and pop-up menus,\n[..] the replacement of meaningful command words by pretty icons\", he is not properly appreciating the value these features had in making computing accessible to more people, and is focusing too much on their runtime cost. Programmers are often too quick to judge software on its technical merits rather than it's social ones.\n\nWirth passed away 2 years ago, but he was a giant in the field of Computer Science and a huge inspiration to me and to many of my other inspirations. In many ways, my focus on simplicity and my own system design sensibilities find their genesis with him.\n\nWirth's law is so self evidently true that it's been a topic of continuous investigation and rediscovery.\n\nA notable example of this was Dan Luu's great post on input lag back in 2017. He felt that input latency was getting worse over time, so he got a high speed camera and measured the delay between pressing a key and the letter appearing on screen across a lot of different hardware. The lowest latency computer was the Apple 2e from 1983.\n\nInput latency has gone up since 1983 because there is a lot more software involved in the pipeline for handling input. The kind of hardware interrupt based input handling the Apple 2e had is not flexible enough to meet modern requirements, so this additional complexity buys us a lot of value... but it's certainly not free, and if you're not careful, one of the costs is latency.\n\nLuu goes on to write a lot about complexity and simplicity, and makes an interesting observation: the modern systems that fix the latency issue mostly do so not through removing complexity but by adding it. There was a lot of talk about complexity and simplicity at the time, because a huge number of software developers were working on another great tradeoff that had been made, this time in the datacenter: the widespread adoption of cloud computing.\n\nIn 1995, when Wirth wrote his essay, if you wanted to run a new internet company, you could just get a computer and run with it. Amazon didn't launch until July of that year, but it was famously started out of Jeff Bezos' garage.\n\nThe requirements for an internet company were simpler back then. The web wasn't some ubiquitous technology with total population penetration. There were only about 16 million people using it at the time; more people had an SNES than used the internet. Slashdot didn't exist. There was no real expectation of 5 9's 24/7/365 availability, and no opportunity to \"go viral.\"\n\nTo run your company's software, you could build your own datacenter, but this is a complicated task requiring a lot of expertise; you need land, permits, contractors, etc. I wouldn't even know where to start.\n\nYou could buy an existing datacenter, but you'd still need to manage power, backup generators/batteries, air conditioning, fire suppression, racks, maintenance, networking. Again, decades in the software industry, and I can barely build a competent list of requirements. It's a big investment, and there's a lot of opex.\n\nYou could rent a rack in a colo and focus on your compute needs, but those needs could change in an instant. If you plan out costs for 100,000 users and you never gain traction, you've overspent and are burning cash on pointless hardware you could be using to develop your product. If you get hit with a tidal wave of interest, you could be showing people the fail whale for years or miss your opportunity for success entirely.\n\nCloud computing was the era's answer. By 2010, Amazon was out of Jeff's basement and running its own massive datacenters for their online operations. As Steve Yegge wrote in 2010, Bezos had distributed an influential API mandate in 2002 requiring all internal teams to make their services available via an API. By 2006, they had already built a platform that they felt they could release to paying customers in the form of EC2 and S3. AWS let you rent capacity in Amazon's datacenter through a web interface or via direct API calls, billed on granular timescales.\n\nEach step in this pipeline imparts additional cost, but they're all pretty valuable, especially the last step. There are even more steps in that pipeline today, with fully managed services like RDS and IAM which abstract the management of software and Lambda which even further abstract your hardware requirements and allow you to scale (and pay) purely on utilization.\n\nEven though the cost to run software had gone up, the improved accessibility of cloud platforms and the reduction of risky capex led to an explosion in web software. All the while, hardware was racing ahead, making the rented capacity more powerful per unit cost and reducing the per-user cost.\n\nUnfortunately, not every \"Wirth tradeoff\" is sound engineering.\n\nEarly in my career, I was working at a newspaper publisher owned by Condé Nast. I was the lead engineer on one of the company's more forward looking development projects, a Django application that managed local sports results data across dozens of regional newspapers. The application provided a single source of truth for very different users and use cases:\n\nThe print syndication system involved writing some pretty gnarly templates in order to generate feeds that could be understood by their newspaper printing systems. After a while, we noticed a problem. These templates were taking minutes to render and setting the database on fire every night.\n\nIf you've been around the block in software, you might already know the issue. The templates were using an ORM which dynamically loaded foreign key fields on attribute access, so innocent looking loops were doing one database query per iteration. These were complex templates with many nested loops: they were sending hundreds of thousands of database queries per render, many of them just the same query over and over again from a different loop in a different part of the template.\n\nWe could fix some of the terrible performance by pre-loading those fields with a join, but we had a lot of templates, and they were complex enough and the database large enough that this wasn't a realistic path to success. As Dan Luu concludes in his study on latency, the solution that worked required adding more complexity in the form of a smart caching layer.\n\nAlthough we didn't know we were making it when we started the template project, this was a \"bad\" Wirth tradeoff. It still had utility: instead of having to manage what data might be needed in what template carefully, we could grab a list of top level objects and let the ORM fetch the rest of the data we needed on the fly.\n\nThe project started up quickly, but even at a pretty low scale of complexity, it became impossible to execute successfully. Before we realized what the problem was, we were using the convenience of these auto-loaded fields without understanding their true cost, and the software we built was a wasteful monstrosity as a result.\n\nI see the same thing happening now but at broader scale with LLMs, and I feel myself sympathizing more and more with Wirth's cane shaking wrath.\n\nProgramming is the act of getting a computer to do something for you. Many people are discovering that for the first time, thanks to LLMs, they can ask a computer to do something for them, and it will actually go and do it. However, limiting yourself to programming only through this approach poses some problems.\n\nWhile they might not be the unbound ecological disaster that many of their detractors claim they are, LLMs are still intensely computationally expensive. You can ask an AI what 2 * 3 is and for the low price of several seconds of waiting, a few milliliters of water and enough power to watch 5% of a TikTok video on a television, it will tell you. But the computer you have in front of you can perform this calculation a billion times per second.\n\nIf the problem of my accidental database denial of service syndication feed was down to ignorance over the costs of ORM usage, it's pretty obvious that a similar kind of ignorance can lead to enormous unintended costs once we start integrating LLMs into our automation.\n\nI've seen a few instances of this out in the wild that lead me to believe that this trap might be particularly tricky to avoid. Despite the capacity for LLMs to educate, or simulate education, or at least point you towards related materials some of which may be real, that's not how laypeople use them.\n\nThey present the LLM with a problem and ask it solve that problem.\n\nOne example of this is from myself, as this is how I used LLMs in my first go, too. I had a dump of recipes from a great but sadly unmaintained recipe site that I wanted to import into a self-hosted recipe management app.\n\nI thought \"Well, this sounds tedious, let me ask an LLM to do this.\" So I pointed a local LLM to the specification for the destination format, and asked it to convert the files. It converted one file every 10 minutes, inaccurately and without proper formatting. It was slow and it produced trash.\n\nWhen you see engineers heap praise on programming agents, this isn't how they are using them. You don't ask the LLM to perform a repetitive and precise task, you ask it to build a script that performs that task. Except in rare cases, this script does not itself use LLMs.\n\nIronically, if you have the foresight to describe this problem to a major AI model and ask it how you should use an AI to solve it, this is exactly what it will tell you to do.\n\nThis approach subtly different from the way you might use LLMs for many other tasks, but it's crucial to getting results that reliably get a computer to do something for you. LLMs don't do reliable, they don't do repeatable. Building a program allows you to iterate on a deterministic solution with a stable source of truth, and you come away with an artifact that may or not be useless, but which actually works, and in my case converts 70 files/sec.\n\nAnother example I came across was this twitter thread by BenjaminDEKR, which I saw being ridiculed on bsky. He asked his personal agent to remind him to get milk, and this led the agent to repeatedly ask Opus if it was daytime yet. Along with the context from his heartbeat file, this resulted in a $0.75 charge for each heartbeat, costing him almost $20 during a single night's sleep.\n\nMaybe you decide that for your purposes 00:00 is night and 08:00 is day and use a basic local gettimeofday call to determine which span you're in. Maybe you're unsatisfied with anything other than astronomical day/night and can generate a sunrise/sunset table for the year using NOAA's unmaintained solar calculator to dynamically produce your day/night spans?\n\nYou could do these things, but not if asking the LLM to solve problems is your problem solving approach. If asking an LLM is the only way you know how to solve problems, then you optimize the question asking by reducing heartbeat frequency and running on a cheaper model. Problem solved!\n\nThe overall concern is that having a magic box that gives you the answers ends up being a thought terminating solution to any problem.\n\nWhen I wrote about the ecological impacts of AI, one of the non-ecological impacts I cited was the possibility that \"AI erodes human skill.\" A recent release by research fellows at Anthropic, \"How AI Impacts Skill Formation\", suggests this fear isn't unfounded:\n\nWe find that AI use impairs conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging abilities, without delivering significant efficiency gains on average.\n\nA few weeks ago, I was at a family gathering watching some of the kids go through a huge backlog of red envelopes that their grandparents had saved for them over various missed holidays. They were pulling out all of the cash, at which point they were going to tally it all up and split it evenly.\n\nWhen the adults challenged them to come up with better counting strategies, one of them suggested they could throw all of the money on the floor, take a picture, and ask ChatGPT to tally it all.\n\nThe instincts are for people to get the AI to do work for them, not to learn from the AI how to do the work themselves.\n\nWirth's law posits that software can erase gains faster than hardware can make them, but I'm afraid the reality is much worse than that.\n\nIf you've studied computer science, you might have heard of a function called Busy Beaver. The name is unfortunately silly, but it's a fairly important thought experiment in computability. BB(N) is defined as the maximum number of steps a terminating turing machine with N states can run.\n\nThis function is known to be noncomputable, because any algorithm that could compute it would be able to solve the halting problem, which is known to be undecidable. BB(1..3) were known in the 1960s to be 1, 6, and 21. In a pleasant bit of symmetry with Dan Luu's experiments, BB(4) was discovered to be 107 in 1983, the same year his Apple 2e was built. In 2024, BB(5) was proven to be 47,176,870.\n\nAs N grows, BB is known to eventually outgrow any computable sequence, including famous fast-growing sequences like TREE(). BB(6) has a lower bound that is so large that it is impossible to explain how large it is to someone without a significant background in mathematics.\n\nSoftware has an unprecedented capability to produce a correct answer in the most resource consuming way possible. Of course, producing incorrect answers or no answer at all is also an option.\n\nDespite the apparent truth of Wirth's law, engineers have been actively battling against it for decades, but I worry that with LLMs we might have lost the war.\n\nAm I just the latest in a long line of engineers who can't appreciate the newfound democratization of programming, or have we crossed into a \"bad\" Wirth tradeoff, where the growth curve of runtime complexity is something that hardware advancements cannot possibly dig us back out of?",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Historians and observers accused the Trump administration of trying to rewrite American history to justify its own foreign policy decisions toward Latin America by posting a “historically inaccurate” version of the Mexican-American war.\n\nThe Monday statement from the White House commemorating the anniversary of the war described the conflict as a “legendary victory that secured the American Southwest, reasserted American sovereignty, and expanded the promise of American independence across our majestic continent.” The statement drew parallels between the period in U.S. history and its own increasingly aggressive policies toward Latin America, which it said would “ensure the Hemisphere remains safe.”\n\n“Guided by our victory on the fields of Mexico 178 years ago, I have spared no effort in defending our southern border against invasion, upholding the rule of law, and protecting our homeland from forces of evil, violence, and destruction,” the statement said, though it was unsigned.\n\nIn the post, the White House makes no mention of the key role slavery played in the war and glorifies the wider “Manifest Destiny” period, which resulted in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Native Americans from their land.\n\nAlexander Aviña, Latin American history professor at Arizona State University, said the White House statement “underplays the massive amounts of violence that it took to expand” the U.S. to the Pacific shore at a time when the Trump administration has stuck its hand in Latin American affairs in a way not seen in decades, deposing Venezuela's president, meddling in elections and threatening military action in Mexico and other countries.\n\n“U.S. political leaders since then have seen this as an ugly aspect of U.S. history, this is a pretty clear instance of U.S. imperialism against its southern neighbor,” Aviña said. “The Trump administration is actually embracing this as a positive in U.S. history and framing it – inaccurately historically – as some sort of defensive measure to prevent the Mexico from invading them.”\n\nOn Tuesday, criticisms of the White House statement quickly rippled across social media.\n\nAsked about the statement in her morning news briefing, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum guffawed, quipping and noting “we have to defend sovereignty.” Sheinbaum, who has walked a tight rope with the Trump administration, has responded to Trump with a balanced tone and occasionally with sarcasm, like when Trump changed the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.\n\nThe Mexican-American war (1846–1848) was triggered by long-running border disputes between the U.S. and Mexico and the United States' annexation of Texas in 1845. For years leading up to the war, Americans had gradually moved into the then-Mexican territory. Mexico had banned slavery and U.S. abolitionists feared the U.S. land grab was in part an attempt to add slave states.\n\nAfter fighting broke out and successive U.S. victories, Mexico ceded more than 525,000 square miles of territory — including what now comprises Arizona, California, western Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas and Utah — to the U.S.\n\nThe moment turned Texas into a key chess piece during the U.S. Civil War and led former President Ulysses S. Grant to write later that the conflict with Mexico was “one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation.\"\n\nThe Associated Press was formed when five New York City newspapers funded a pony express route through Alabama to bring news of the Mexican War — as it is sometimes known in the U.S. — north faster than the U.S. Post Office could deliver it.\n\nThe war continues to be a historical sticking point between the two countries, particularly as Sheinbaum repeatedly reminds Trump that her country is a sovereign nation whenever Trump openly weighs taking military action against Mexican cartels and pressures Mexico to bend to its will.\n\nThe White House statement falls in line with wider actions taken by the Trump administration to mold the federal government's language around its own creed, said Albert Camarillo, history professor at Stanford University, who described the statement as a “distorted, ahistorical, imperialist version\" of the war.\n\nAviña said the statement serves \"to assert rhetorically that the U.S. is justified in establishing its so-called ‘America First’ policy throughout the Americas,” regardless of the historical accuracy.\n\nThe Trump administration has ordered the rewriting of history on display at the Smithsonian Institution, saying it was “restoring truth and sanity to American history.”\n\nThe administration has scrubbed government websites of history, legal records and data it finds disagreeable. Trump also ordered the government to remove any signs that “inappropriately disparage Americans past or living,\" including those making reference to slavery, destruction of Native American cultures and climate change.\n\n“This statement is consistent with so many others that attempt to whitewash and reframe U.S. history and erase generations of historical scholarship,” Camarillo said.",

    "description": "Coach Mike Vrabel expects an \"identity war\" when his New England Patriots meet the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday in Super Bowl LX, he said Monday.",
    "fullText": "SAN JOSE, Calif., Feb. 3 (UPI) -- Coach Mike Vrabel expects an \"identity war\" when his New England Patriots meet the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday in Super Bowl LX, he said Monday.\n\nA minor earthquake hit San Ramon, Calif., on Monday morning, but additional soil shifted hours later south in the Bay Area when Patriots and Seahawks players kicked off Super Bowl week at opening night in San Jose.\n\nPlayers from both teams fielded questions, which flew at them with the unpredictability of bouncing footballs. Fans flocked to the San Jose Convention Center just to catch glimpses of the NFL stars. Hundreds of reporters shouted questions, with content spanning from the mundane to bizarre.\n\nBut one thing was clear: the explicitly expressed identities of Vrabel's Patriots and coach Mike Macdonald's Seahawks. And neither coach is willing to budge ahead of their quest for a Lombardi Trophy.\n\n\"This will be a great identity matchup for us,\" Vrabel said. \"This will be an identity war on the biggest stage. They play hard. Their defense runs to the football. They cause a lot of turnovers.\n\n\"They are committed to running the football. It's a physical football team. ... This will be a huge challenge.\"\n\nVrabel's Patriots share similar characteristics. The Patriots and Seahawks each rank inside the Top 4 in points scored and points allowed. They also ranked inside the Top 8 in yards gained and yards allowed in 2025.\n\nMVP candidate Drake Maye propelled the Patriots, who totaled the fourth-most passing yards in the NFL. The Patriots also ranked 6th in rushing.\n\nVeteran quarterback Sam Darnold and the Seahawks ranked No. 8 in passing yards and No. 10 in rushing.\n\nThe Seahawks defense ranked No. 3 against the run and No. 10 against the pass. The Patriots ranked No. 6 against the run and No. 9 against the pass.\n\nA key difference between the teams this season was the Seahawks' strength in special teams, specifically returns. They ranked third in both kick and punt return average. That element, which aids field position, could be crucial in a game played between two tough defenses.\n\nThe team to establish dominance in their valued areas is likely to win Super Bowl LX.\n\n\"We are going to do everything we can to go out there and play a good football game,\" Darnold said. \"Execute the way we know how to execute.\"\n\nNeither coach would disclose specifics within their game plans, but Macdonald also plans to implement the Seahawks' previously successful strategies.\n\n\"We are going to stick to our process,\" Macdonald said. \"The way we wanna play is we always want to be within our wheelhouse, but every game we are going to tailor things to our opponents.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, we have to do the things we are really good at. Right now, that's our plan.\"\n\nVrabel's mere presence could be an advantage for the Patriots. The coach, who won three Super Bowls as a Patriots linebacker, took plenty of lessons from those runs. He expects that knowledge to pay off this week in the Bay Area, when players will be confronted with potential distractions.\n\n\"I think that all builds up to the end of the week, on things we can focus on that may be a little different with this football game; the warm-up time before the game, the length of halftime,\" Vrabel said. \"All of these things that are going to be a little bit different. We can try to draw on everybody's experiences.\"\n\nThe Seahawks and Patriots will practice this week at respective facilities at San Jose State and Stanford, which sit about 22 miles apart.\n\n\"It's just another challenge,\" Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzalez said. \"We are playing the other best team in the NFL. We're excited for it. Just ready to go out there and have one more with the guys on Sunday.\"\n\nThe Seahawks are 4.5-point favorites. The least expensive price for a ticket for Super Bowl LX, as of Monday night, was listed for about $5,000 on the secondary market.",

What makes On This Day notable is that it was made by Darren Aronofsky’s studio Primordial Soup. What also makes it interesting is that it was created with AI. The third thing that makes it interesting is that it is terrible.\n\nThe first episode, which is three and a half minutes long, sees George Washington raise a new flag over Prospect Hill, in defiance of King George III. It is the moment, according to the video’s description, that “rebellion becomes resolve”. And if that dollop of ChatGPT-sounding sloganeering terrifies the life out of you, wait until you actually watch the thing.\n\nIt is, as you might expect, as ugly as sin. It’s the sort of thing that looks like it was shooting for photorealism, but then either chickened out or blew up along the way. In the very first shot, King George’s hair looks like someone melted down and hardened a plastic badger. And this is a shame because, like so much generative AI at the moment, an awful lot of the episode consists of shots where we see the characters from behind. This is, after all, because the back of an AI-generated head is far less likely to send people into screaming fits of trauma than an AI-generated face, and Aronofsky is a humanist.\n\nBecause, good lord, the faces. Since the revolutionary war was largely initiated by older men, On This Day is filled with the wrinkled almost-faces of several well-known figures. And it is truly disconcerting to see, not only because they all have the uncanny dead eyes of people ripped out of The Polar Express, but because the wrinkles keep shifting in colour and depth.\n\nIt’s an effect that makes it look like the characters were drawn on several sheets of tissue paper that nobody could line up properly. Benjamin Franklin, who turns up during episode two, is particularly nightmarish. He looks as if someone has genetically spliced Hugh Laurie with Anthony Hopkins, and then covered the resulting monstrosity in a thin layer of roving liver spots. I’m overselling the point here, but it really is extremely creepy to watch.\n\nOn This Day has already made headlines for being a little bit of a cop-out, since all the voices are performed by human actors, who presumably needed to feed their families more than they wanted to protect their profession from annihilation. And this is telling, because these voices are by far the most convincing part of On This Day, especially when deployed in voiceover, because then you aren’t distracted by the way the movement of their mouths doesn’t quite match up with the noises coming out of them.\n\nBut surely the day is coming where they won’t be needed. As horrible as it is, On This Day is already strides better than a lot of other AI-generated output. True, the whole thing still looks like a mangled cross between an animatronic sex toy convention and those old Taiwanese news cartoons, but compare a character here with Tilly Norwood, and you can see that real progress has been made in a frighteningly short amount of time. Soon we will have picture-perfect AI creations with entirely convincing human voices. After that, it won’t be long before content like On This Day is entirely created – written, acted, directed and edited – by prompt alone. And when that happens, Aronofsky can pat himself on the back for doing himself out of a job.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the human film industry reacts to On This Day, particularly other actors. We’ve already seen, in Tilly Norwood, that these creations appear to be modelled on human faces, and this is even more the case here. In particular, the depiction of Thomas Paine seems like it flashes through the faces of any number of recognisable actors. The key one seems to be Ralph Fiennes, but there are also glimmers of Daniel Day-Lewis and Matthew Macfadyen.\n\nLess than two years ago Scarlett Johansson hired legal counsel after she noticed that an OpenAI application had a voice that was “eerily similar” to hers. In a climate like this, it isn’t out of the question to imagine that actors will start doing the same if they recognise their likeness in an AI-generated performer.\n\nBut this is a concern for another time. What matters now is that On This Day … 1776 is genuinely very horrible to watch, and everybody involved should be ashamed. It is by far the most disturbing thing Aronofsky has made, and I’ve seen the last eight minutes of Requiem for a Dream.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A new round of U.S.-brokered talks on ending Russia’s war on Ukraine is set to go ahead this week after a brief postponement, a senior Kremlin official said Monday, with negotiations taking place against a backdrop of continued front-line fighting and deadly long-range attacks on rear areas.\n\nThe trilateral talks will take place on Wednesday and Thursday in Abu Dhabi, where a previous meeting was held last month, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday that he would be sending a delegation to the meeting, which initially was to be held at the weekend but was delayed by what Peskov said were scheduling conflicts.\n\nThe Trump administration has over the past year pushed the two sides to find compromises. But breaking the deadlock on key issues appears no closer as the fourth anniversary of Russia’s all-out invasion of its neighbor approaches later this month.\n\nPeskov described the talks as “very complex.”\n\n“On some issues, we have certainly come closer because there have been discussions, conversations, and on some issues it is easier to find common ground,” he told reporters. “There are issues where it’s more difficult to find common ground.”\n\nRussian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev was in Miami, Florida, at the weekend for talks with American officials, but Peskov refused to provide any details of the meeting.\n\nA key sticking point is whether Russia gets to keep the Ukrainian territory its army has occupied, especially in Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland. Moscow is also demanding possession of other Ukrainian land there that it hasn’t been able to capture.\n\nRussian drones and missiles have continued to bombard civilian areas , killing 12 miners in a bus on Sunday in the most recent mass aerial attack. The barrages have also wrecked the Ukrainian power grid, leaving people without heating, light and running water in bitter winter cold.\n\nDefense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said Monday that authorities are taking steps to prevent Russia using Starlink satellite services to steer its drones toward their targets.\n\nFedorov asked Elon Musk’s SpaceX to help deny Russia use of the service in Ukraine. Starlink is a global internet network that relies on around 10,000 satellites orbiting Earth.\n\nUkraine is requiring civilian and military Starlink users to register their terminals on a database, allowing approved devices to function while unregistered terminals would be disabled inside Ukraine, Fedorov said.\n\n“Looks like the steps we took to stop the unauthorized use of Starlink by Russia have worked,” Musk said Sunday on X. “Let us know if more needs to be done.”\n\nLitvinova contributed from Tallinn, Estonia.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "\"During World War II, the British dressed a dead body in a Royal Marines uniform and planted letters saying the Allies were going to invade Greece, and that Sicily was just a decoy. It was called Operation Mincemeat.\"",
    "fullText": "Context: The body used in Operation Mincemeat was that of Glyndwr Michael, a Welsh man who died after ingesting rat poison. He was dressed as \"Captain (Acting Major) William Martin\" of the Royal Marines and planted with fake letters, supposedly written by General Archibald Nye to General Harold Alexander. The letters claimed that Greece and Sardinia were the real invasion targets, with Sicily presented as a decoy.\n\nOn April 30, 1943, the submarine HMS Seraph released the body off the coast of Huelva, Spain, a country closely aligned with Germany. Intercepted German communications later confirmed that the deception worked. In response, Hitler transferred the 1st Panzer Division to Greece, doubled the Sardinian garrison to 10,000 troops, and moved seven infantry divisions away from Italy. The Allied invasion of Sicily, known as Operation Husky, began on July 9, 1943, and succeeded in part because German defenses had been deliberately thinned as a result of the ruse.\n\nContext: In April 1942, soldiers of the Polish 2nd Transport Company (later 22nd Artillery Supply Company) encountered an Iranian boy near Hamadan with an orphaned Syrian brown bear cub. They traded items — reportedly a Swiss Army knife, coins, and rations — for the cub. To circumvent British regulations forbidding mascots on military transport ships, Wojtek was officially enlisted as a private, receiving a serial number and paybook. He was later promoted to corporal. At the Battle of Monte Cassino (May 1944), eyewitnesses reported seeing Wojtek help move crates of artillery ammunition, though debate exists about whether these were live shells or empties. After the war, Wojtek lived at Edinburgh Zoo from 1947 until his death in December 1963.\n\nContext: According to the US Census Bureau's 2007 analysis, Washington ranked #138 among American surnames, with 89.9% of bearers being Non-Hispanic Black (146,520 of 163,036 total). A 2016 Census update showed the percentage remained above 87%. Genealogist Tony Burroughs is widely cited for the 82–94% figure for earlier censuses (1880–1930). However, historians caution that the reasons freedpeople chose this surname varied — some chose it to honor George Washington, while others took the surnames of their former enslavers (white families named Washington). As Burroughs noted: \"It's an assumption that the surname is tied to George... As far as I'm concerned, it's a coincidence.\"\n\nContext: Melbourne was never officially named \"Batmania\" by any government authority. However, the earliest documented use of \"Batmania\" appears in a satirical letter to the Launceston Cornwall Chronicle (June 13, 1835), explicitly mocking John Batman's contested land claims with Aboriginal peoples. The term also appeared on some private maps of the Port Phillip Association, but Police Magistrate George Stewart's 1836 official report called the settlement \"Bearbrass.\" Governor Richard Bourke voided Batman's private treaty (August 1835) and officially named the town \"Melbourne\" on April 10, 1837, after William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, the British Prime Minister at the time.\n\nContext: During major events, Versailles could accommodate up to 10,000 people, with inadequate sanitation infrastructure for such crowds. Primary sources confirm the problem. Princess Elizabeth Charlotte (Liselotte), Duchess of Orléans, wrote in 1702: \"The people stationed in the galleries in front of our room piss in all the corners. It is impossible to leave one's apartments without seeing somebody pissing.\" However, historian Tony Spawforth notes that Versailles was not entirely devoid of facilities — it had public latrines, private cabinets d'aisance in noble apartments, and received its first flush toilet in 1738. The palace's sanitation problems were real but sometimes exaggerated in popular accounts.\n\nContext: When Israel's first president, Chaim Weizmann, died on November 9, 1952, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion instructed Ambassador Abba Eban to offer the presidency to Einstein. The formal letter arrived on November 17, 1952. Einstein's written response read: \"I am deeply moved by the offer from our State of Israel, and at once saddened and ashamed that I cannot accept it. All my life I have dealt with objective matters, hence I lack both the natural aptitude and the experience to deal properly with people.\" Ben-Gurion reportedly told an aide: \"Tell me what to do if he says yes! I've had to offer the post because it's impossible not to. But if he accepts, we are in for trouble.\"\n\nContext: The Soviet anti-tank dog program operated from approximately 1930 to 1946. Dogs carried 10–12 kg explosive mines with a wooden lever trigger that would detonate when the dog crawled beneath a tank. Training involved placing food beneath stationary vehicles to condition the dogs. However, training occurred on Soviet diesel-engine tanks, while German tanks used gasoline engines with distinctly different sounds and exhaust smells. During the disastrous first combat deployment in summer 1941, dogs frequently ran toward familiar-smelling Soviet tanks or retreated to trenches — forcing handlers to shoot their own returning animals. The program claimed 300 German tank kills, though historians consider approximately 50 more realistic. Combat use largely ended by 1943, with training schools shifting focus to mine-detection work.\n\nContext: Eight German saboteurs landed by U-boat on US shores in June 1942 — four on Long Island, four in Florida. Two of them, George Dasch and Ernst Burger, had no intention of completing the mission: Dasch considered America his adopted country, and Burger had spent 17 months in a Nazi concentration camp. Shortly after landing, Dasch contacted the FBI, though they were skeptical until he dumped $84,000 in mission funds on an agent's desk. His information led to the capture of all eight within two weeks.\n\nA military tribunal convicted them all. Six were executed by electric chair at the District of Columbia jail on August 8, 1942: Richard Quirin, Heinrich Heinck, Edward Kerling, Werner Thiel, Herbert Haupt, and Hermann Neubauer. Dasch and Burger received prison sentences instead — 30 years and life, respectively — for their cooperation.\n\nThis was the largest federal execution by electric chair, but not the US record overall. Kentucky executed seven men on July 13, 1928, and New York executed seven at Sing Sing on August 12, 1912.\n\nSources: Naval History and Heritage Command, The Times\n\nContext: The scientific evidence for ancient polychromy (painted sculpture) is now overwhelming. Using ultraviolet light, X-ray fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopy, researchers have identified traces of Egyptian blue, cinnabar red, ochre yellow, and malachite green on ancient sculptures. Vinzenz Brinkmann at the Liebieghaus Skulpturensammlung in Frankfurt has been studying this since the 1980s, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art's \"Chroma: Ancient Sculpture in Color\" exhibition (2022–2023) displayed vivid scientific reconstructions. As the Met's chief scientist Marco Leona put it: \"A completely white statue, to a Greek observer, would have looked like some shoddy effort.\"\n\nContext: The Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley sank the USS Housatonic on February 17, 1864, about four miles offshore from Charleston Harbor — the first successful submarine attack in naval history. The hand-cranked, 40-foot vessel used a spar torpedo: a copper cylinder packed with gunpowder mounted on a 22-foot pole. The Housatonic sank in about five minutes, killing five Union sailors. But the Hunley never signaled its return, and all eight crew members perished with it.\n\nWhen the wreck was raised in 2000, it was remarkably intact — no major hull damage, hatches still closed, bilge pumps unused. The crew's skeletons were found still seated at their stations, with no broken bones or signs they'd tried to escape. The mystery lingered for years until Duke researcher Rachel Lance (2017) concluded that the shockwave from their own torpedo — detonated just 16 feet from the bow — transmitted through the hull and caused fatal lung trauma, killing them instantly.\n\nContext: Three major earthquakes struck the New Madrid Seismic Zone between 1811 and 1812: December 16, 1811 (M7.5), January 23, 1812 (M7.3), and February 7, 1812 (M7.5). These destroyed the town of New Madrid, Missouri, toppled chimneys as far as Cincinnati, St. Louis, and Kentucky, and were felt over approximately 1 million square miles. Eyewitness Eliza Bryan wrote of \"the screams of the affrighted inhabitants... the roaring of the Mississippi.\" The February 1812 quake even created Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee when the ground sank by as much as 6 meters.\n\nAs for the 1990 panic, self-proclaimed climatologist Iben Browning predicted a 50% probability of a major earthquake for December 2–3, 1990. Schools across four states closed, businesses shuttered, and the St. Louis Red Cross distributed 230,000 earthquake preparedness kits. Nothing happened. Northwestern geologist Seth Stein called it \"the greatest non-event since 'The War of the Worlds.'\"\n\nContext: The Haitian Revolution was crucial to Napoleon's decision to sell Louisiana. Napoleon sent over 20,000 troops under General Charles Leclerc to reconquer Saint-Domingue, with reinforcements eventually bringing the total to more than 30,000. The vast majority perished — primarily from yellow fever — with fewer than 8,000 surviving. Saint-Domingue had been France's most valuable colony, generating approximately 300 million livres annually. Louisiana was intended as a supply base for Caribbean sugar operations. So without Saint-Domingue, it became strategically worthless. War with Britain was also imminent (it resumed in May 1803), meaning France couldn't defend Louisiana anyway. The $15 million sale (roughly $380 million today) was a strategic reallocation of an indefensible asset, not simple bankruptcy.\n\nContext: The 369th Infantry Regiment was composed of African American soldiers, segregated from the US Army and assigned to the French 16th Division (4th French Army). They spent 191 days under fire — the longest of any American unit — and their record states they \"never lost a foot of ground.\"\n\nThe soldier referenced is Private Henry Johnson. On May 15, 1918, Johnson and fellow soldier Needham Roberts were manning an observation post when a German raiding party of at least 12 attacked. Despite sustaining 21 wounds, Johnson fought them off, primarily with his bolo knife, killing four and wounding others. He was awarded the French Croix de Guerre, but wouldn't receive the US Medal of Honor until 2015, posthumously.\n\nThe regiment suffered approximately 1,500 casualties during the war. After the armistice on November 11, 1918, they became the first Allied unit to reach the Rhine River, arriving on November 20 as occupation forces.\n\nContext: Truman learned about the Manhattan Project shortly after becoming president upon Roosevelt's sudden death in April 1945. He was briefed by Secretary of War Henry Stimson and received detailed information about the bomb's development and potential.\n\nThe more nuanced historical argument, advanced by nuclear historian Alex Wellerstein, is that Truman may have misunderstood Hiroshima's nature — believing it was primarily a military installation rather than a city with a military base. In his July 25, 1945, diary entry, Truman wrote he had ordered the bomb used \"so that military objectives and soldiers and sailors are the target and not women and children.\" On August 9, he stated publicly that \"the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, a military base.\"\n\nWellerstein subsequently argues that Truman likely learned the full extent of civilian casualties only on August 8, the day before Nagasaki. On August 10, 1945, Truman ordered that no further atomic bombs be dropped without his express authorization, asserting presidential control over nuclear weapons for the first time. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act), signed August 1, 1946, transferred nuclear weapons from military to civilian control and established the Atomic Energy Commission, institutionalizing civilian/presidential authority over nuclear weapons.\n\nContext: Much of what we know comes from two key sources. On the Mediterranean side, The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (mid-first century CE) was written by a Greek-speaking Egyptian merchant living under Roman rule. While the author himself traveled only as far as India, the text refers to lands farther east, including a place called \"Thinae,\" generally understood to mean China, based on reports circulating through Indian Ocean trade networks.\n\nOn the Chinese side, the Hou Hanshu (Book of the Later Han) records that in 166 CE, envoys claiming to represent \"Andun, king of Daqin\" — likely the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus — arrived at the court of Emperor Huan. They came by sea via Rinan (in modern-day Vietnam), bearing luxury goods such as ivory, rhinoceros horn, and tortoise shell. Most historians believe these were not official diplomats but Greco-Roman merchants operating out of Roman Egypt or Syria, traveling through Southeast Asian maritime routes.\n\nAlso in Nifty: These 14 DIY Fails Are Just So, Sooooo Bad (And I'm Laughing So, Sooooo Hard)\n\nAlso in Nifty: People Are Sharing Things You See In Someone Else's Home That Immediately Signal They're Middle Class",

    "description": "Top 10: The Second World War Fighters Souped-Up for Extreme Air Racing",
    "fullText": "Reno Air Racing, described as ‘the world’s fastest motorsport’, is a blistering blend of aviation heritage, extreme engineering and thrilling speed.\n\nHeld in the Nevada desert, it pits legendary warbirds against one another in low-level, high-G duels around a pylon course. These aircraft, once icons of combat, are now stripped, clipped and polished to extremes.\n\nEngines are souped-up, wings shortened, cooling systems re-engineered — all in the relentless pursuit of speed. Prop tips blur, exhausts roar, and pilots skim the desert floor, often at over 450 mph. It’s not just racing; it’s the ultimate fusion of history, danger, and adrenaline.\n\nThe Curtiss P-40E Warhawk, famed for its shark-mouthed nose art and rugged wartime service, found a second life roaring over Reno’s desert skies. Once a symbol of wartime grit, it became a rare but thrilling sight among the sleek Mustangs and Bearcats dominating the Unlimited Class air races.\n\nUnlike the supercharged, high-altitude racers built later in the war, the P-40E was a tough, low-to-mid-altitude fighter, never the fastest — but its broad wings, throaty Allison engine, and unmistakable silhouette made it unforgettable. Racers who chose the Warhawk prized its stability and character, favouring heritage over outright performance.\n\nTo compete, mechanics stripped out armour, guns, and unnecessary weight, tuned the Allison V-1710 for maximum output, and polished every inch of its metal to minimise drag. Some even fitted larger props and fuel tweaks, wringing every last knot from its classic frame. The transformation kept the Warhawk’s soul but pushed its limits.\n\nP‑40s have occasionally raced at Reno, often in the Bronze or Unlimited classes. Airframes like Texas Warhawk (2017) reached qualifying speeds near 292 mph, with race speeds around 270 mph.\n\nThe F8F Bearcat was the ultimate example of Grumman’s pantheon of piston-engined naval fighters. The company’s earlier Hellcat had been instrumental in defeating Japan, and the Bearcat was even more potent. Compact, with immaculate handling, the F8F was utterly brilliant.\n\nLong before the Bearcat had entered the realm of racing, it snatched the absolute climb rate record for piston-engined aircraft, whizzing up to 10,000 feet in 94 seconds in 1946. Fast and with a strong structure that lent itself to modification, the Bearcat was a ripe candidate for the Reno races.\n\nRare Bear is a heavily modified Grumman F8F Bearcat, rebuilt by pilot Lyle Shelton from a crashed airframe in 1969 for air racing. Fitted with a powerful Wright R-3350 radial engine producing over 4000 horsepower, it became one of the fastest piston-engine aircraft ever built.\n\nIn 1989, Rare Bear set a 3 km (1.86 mile) world speed record of 528.33 mph (850.26 km/h). With shortened wings, aerodynamic refinements, and distinctive “bear” artwork, it dominated the Unlimited Class at the Reno Air Races.\n\nThere is much debate over what the ultimate piston-engined fighter was; some offer the P-51H, P-47N, or other types for this prestigious, subjective ranking, but the two most common candidates are the American Grumman Bearcat and the British Hawker Sea Fury. This sense of rivalry between these two brilliant radial-engined naval fighters carries on over eighty years after their first flights. Though the Sea Fury did not serve in the war, we will include it as it took its first flight in 1945.\n\nThe Hawker Sea Fury T.Mk 20 Dreadnought began life as a two-seat Royal Navy trainer, designed to familiarise pilots with the high-powered radial engine and handling characteristics of the single-seat fighter variants. When converted for air racing, Dreadnought underwent extensive modifications.\n\nThe rear seat was removed, structural reinforcements were added, and a Pratt & Whitney R‑4360 radial engine, producing around 3,800 hp, replaced the standard powerplant. These changes enabled the aircraft to safely handle extreme speeds and high g-forces on the pylon course while maintaining control over its large airframe.\n\nDreadnought reached qualifying speeds of 452.7 mph (according to unofficial sources) in 1986 and, piloted by Joel Swager in 2018, achieved a Gold Unlimited victory at Reno with a race speed of 417.735 mph. Over its career, it accumulated multiple wins and several second-place finishes, demonstrating remarkable consistency and reliability despite its size. The September Fury is another Hawker Sea Fury turned Reno Unlimited racer.\n\nThe Vought F4U Corsair, (and the Goodyear F2G Super Corsair) is a legendary Second World War naval fighter, famed for its distinctive inverted gull wings and powerful Pratt & Whitney radial engine. It served with the United States Navy and Marines in the Pacific, excelling in both air‑to‑air combat and ground‑attack roles, reaching speeds of around 446 mph in standard military form (we’ve used a wartime Corsair image here).\n\nIts combination of agility, firepower, and durability made it a favourite among pilots and a feared adversary in the skies, cementing its place in aviation history. The Corsair at Reno is a rare and captivating sight, one of the few warbirds of its kind to race in the Unlimited Class. Its presence is significant because very few Corsairs were ever modified or maintained for competitive racing, making it a true gem for air-race enthusiasts.\n\nAt the Reno Air Races, modified Corsairs proved remarkable in the Unlimited Class. The F4U‑derived Super Corsair N31518, piloted by Steve Hinton, won the Unlimited Gold in 1985, averaging 438.186 mph over the eight‑lap course. Goodyear F2G N5588N, known as Race 57, was restored and entered competition in 1999, achieving impressive results.\n\nTheir participation was rare, as few Corsairs were ever adapted for racing, and each airframe brought both historical significance and thrilling performance to the event. The aircraft’s gull wings give it instant charisma. Despite a relative scarcity of usable photographs, the Corsair’s speed rand rarity prestige make it an essential inclusion on our list.\n\n‘Steadfast’ began life as one of a batch of 10 modern Yak-3Us built in the early 2000s in Romania by Avioane Craiova. The original Yak-3U was an experimental Yak-3 development fitted with a radial ASh-82 engine in place of the usual V-12 Klimov which did not enter production but several replicas have been built.\n\nMost replicas destined for owners in the west received R-1830 engines but when Will Whiteside acquired this Yak as an unfinished, engineless, potential racer project, he decided to install a rather more potent Pratt & Whitney R-2000, as fitted to the DC-4, but tuned to deliver 1750hp.\n\nCompared to most Reno racers, 1750hp doesn’t sound that much but the Yak airframe is light, small and streamlined. Steadfast (a name derived from Reno’s Stead airport and the intention to go fast) raced at Reno for six years and attained first place in the Unlimited Silver in 2012.\n\nThe aircraft benefited from significant aerodynamic work to remove drag, it utilises an oversized spinner (from an A-26) and an afterspinner to smooth airflow through the cowling Steadfast ultimately set nine speed and climb records, including the speed record for its class at 416mph. Since 2017 Steadfast has been based in New Zealand.\n\nThe P‑51 Mustang became a common choice for air racers in America due to the large number of surplus airframes available after World War II. Its robust design, high-speed potential, and adaptability made it ideal for conversion into Unlimited Class racers, and “Strega” emerged as one of the most successful and recognisable examples.\n\nStrega, a highly modified P‑51D, dominated the Reno Air Races for decades. Powered by a tuned Packard Merlin engine producing over 3000 hp, it could reach qualifying speeds exceeding 500 mph.\n\nIts aerodynamic refinements, including clipped wings, polished surfaces, and custom cooling systems, allowed it to maintain exceptional control through tight pylon turns at extreme velocities, a key factor in its repeated victories.\n\nOver its racing career, Strega won the Unlimited Gold Class multiple times, often competing head-to-head with other top Mustangs like Dago Red and Precious Metal. Its consistent podium finishes and record-setting laps made it a benchmark in air racing, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining World War 2-era airframes with modern engineering and tuning.\n\nBeyond speed, Strega’s legacy lies in its influence on piston-engine racing. Its dominance highlighted the advantages of the P‑51 platform, inspiring other racers to optimise weight, aerodynamics, and power to compete at the highest levels of the Reno Air Races.\n\nDago Red is a North American P‑51 Mustang (44‑74996) restored as a competitive air racer by Frank Taylor in 1981. Taylor piloted Dago Red to numerous world records and championship victories during the 1980s. In 1983 at Mojave, California, the aircraft set a 15 km world speed record of 517.323 mph, highlighting its extreme performance and engineering.\n\nOver its racing career, Dago Red achieved repeated success at the Reno Air Races, including winning the Gold Unlimited class in 1982. It secured the Thompson Trophy in 2003 with a fastest lap of 512.164 mph and fastest race speed of 507.105 mph.\n\nIn 2001, it recorded the fastest qualifying speed at Reno at 497.797 mph. Across two decades, Dago Red won the National Championship Air Races six times (1982, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, and 2003), cementing its reputation as one of the premier piston-engine racers in the world.\n\nThe aircraft is powered by a race-tuned Rolls-Royce Merlin V12, estimated at 3500–3800 hp, driving a four-bladed Hamilton Standard paddle propeller. Its lightweight 7200 lb empty weight and 32 ft wingspan allow it to handle tightly around pylons at extreme speeds. With a maximum speed exceeding 520 mph and a rate of climb of 8,000 ft/min, Dago Red remains a benchmark in air racing, demonstrating the pinnacle of Mustang performance and Taylor’s piloting skill.\n\nThe P‑51XR, known as Precious Metal, was built in 1988 for high-speed air racing and should not be confused with the original P‑51D or the replica Precious Metal II. It is one of the most radical and exciting modified Mustangs ever created, combining a classic airframe with extreme engineering.\n\nIt retained the P‑51 fuselage but incorporated a Rolls‑Royce Griffon 57A engine producing dramatically more horsepower than the original Merlin. To handle the immense torque, it used contra-rotating propellers from an Avro Shackleton (the same Griffon/contra arrangement was tested on the cancelled MB5 fighter), significantly improving stability and allowing pilots to exploit full power without losing control during tight pylon turns at Reno.\n\nThis mighty propulsion system combined with structural reinforcements to cope with the Griffon’s power, made Precious Metal one of the most capable and aggressive piston-engine racers ever built, pushing a WWII-era fighter far beyond its original limits.\n\nIts debut at the 1988 Reno Air Races immediately marked it as a contender, though early mechanical issues limited performance. Over time, it earned multiple podium finishes in the Unlimited Class, including a sixth-place finish in the Gold race. As an intriguing aside, the wartime Martin-Baker MB5 also adopted a Griffon/contra arrangement, a spectacular fighter prototype that did not enter production.\n\nThe Red Baron, a heavily modified P‑51D Mustang (NX7715C / 44‑84961), became one of the most iconic competitors in the Reno Air Races. Originally entered under various names, including Race #5 “Miss RJ” and “Roto‑Finish,” it was later reborn as Red Baron, with extensive modifications to maximise speed and performance.\n\nFrom its earliest appearances in 1966, the aircraft demonstrated competitive potential, qualifying 10th at 283.770 mph and finishing 5th in the consolation race at 304.990 mph. By 1968, Red Baron had established itself as a serious contender, qualifying 1st at 379.650 mph and finishing 2nd in the championship race at 386.852 mph. Subsequent years saw further improvements, and by 1971 it qualified 1st at 419.501 mph, finishing 4th in the championship at 412.101 mph.\n\nThe aircraft’s performance improvements came from detailed engineering modifications: the airframe was lightened by removing non-essential equipment, the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine was race-tuned to over 3,500 hp, and aerodynamic refinements—including a custom four-blade Hamilton Standard propeller, polished surfaces, and modified control surfaces—reduced drag while increasing stability through tight pylon turns.\n\nThough we have focused on the hardware, the pilot skills demonstrated by the Reno pilots is masterly. Competitors needed precise throttle management and exacting handling to safely maintain speeds exceeding 400 mph near the ground. Red Baron’s consistent podium finishes and record-setting laps cemented its place as one of the most formidable Unlimited Class racers in Reno history.\n\nThe North American P‑51D Mustang Voodoo, piloted by Steve Hinton Jr., is widely recognised as the fastest piston‑engine propeller aircraft in the world. Its record-breaking performance at the Reno Air Races showcased the incredible potential of carefully modified warbirds. Every detail, from aerodynamics to engine tuning, was optimised for sheer speed.\n\nOn 2 September 2017, Voodoo achieved an astonishing average speed of 531.64 mph (855.59 km/h) over the three‑kilometre course. This feat required not only a meticulously prepared aircraft but a pilot of extraordinary skill and courage.\n\nThe Mustang’s balance of power, control, and agility made it perfect for the tight, high-speed turns of Reno’s Unlimited Class racing. Voodoo's crowning moment came in 1972, when it won the championship race at 416.160 mph.\n\nLater modifications, including a Rolls‑Royce Griffon engine and contra‑rotating propellers, pushed the aircraft to new extremes, achieving 1st-place qualifying at 427 mph and winning the championship at 415 mph in 1978.\n\nFollow Joe Coles on Substack, Twitter X  or Blue Sky.

    "fullText": "Former Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene went absolutely nuts on President Donald Trump in a new interview, branding his Make America Great Again movement a “big lie” and accusing the president of ignoring U.S. citizens so that he can focus on waging “war on behalf of Israel.”\n\nThe ex-lawmaker shared her eyebrow-raising thoughts in an interview with political commentator Kim Iversen on YouTube on Thursday.\n\n“MAGA is — I think people are realizing it was all a lie. It was a big lie for the people,” Greene said.\n\nShe said Trump has completely turned on his base and is more worried about serving the “big big donors” who send money to his PACs and have pitched in for his new ballroom.\n\n“Those are the people that get the special favors, the government contracts, they get the pardons,” Greene said. “And it’s the foreign countries that are running the show here. It’s the major big corporations and what is best for the world. That’s really what MAGA is.”\n\nGreene then accused the president of caring more about Iran than what’s going on in the USA.\n\n“I’m sorry, we’ve got civil war practically breaking out in Minnesota, can we not care about that?” she said.\n\nGreene then moved to bashing Israel, which she said Trump is fixated on. She accused him of overlooking “murdered” Gazans so that he can eventually build a new Trump hotel.\n\n“We’re seeing war on behalf of Israel,” Greene fumed. “We’re seeing the people in Gaza — innocent people in Gaza, hundreds of thousands of them completely murdered, so that they can build some new real estate development and money can pour in and everyone can get rich there in New Gaza.”\n\nHer comments come a few weeks after Greene resigned from Congress. She announced she was leaving public office last fall amid her feud with Trump, which largely stemmed from her accusing the president of not moving fast enough to release files on dead sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nTrump in return gave her the nickname Marjorie “Traitor” Greene and said his former ally had “some sort of act going on.”\n\nWatch via The Kim Iversen Show.\n\nThe post Marjorie Taylor Greene Bluntly Declares MAGA ‘Was All a Lie’ in Scalding Take on Trump’s GOP first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Europe fears it can't beat Russia's style of war — creating a golden opportunity for defense founders.",
    "fullText": "Kelluu began, as startups often do, in an old shed.\n\nThe small Finnish company makes airships — think van-sized blimps — originally designed to watch over power lines with cameras.\n\nWhen I met the firm's CEO, Janne Hietala, last fall, he arrived at our restaurant in Joensuu with news. Kelluu, a seven-year-old company, had just become a defense contractor.\n\nA NATO member had agreed to buy airships for surveillance under an alliance program pushing Western militaries to adopt new tech. The buyer hasn't been named, but it plans to integrate the airships into its military within two years.\n\nKelluu's ascent was just as rapid. The company's first showcase to NATO, Hietala said, was in November 2024.\n\nKelluu is trying to make it big in a market that hasn't been kind to small firms. Traditionally, Western nations have depended on giant contractors that meticulously take decades to create and fine-tune systems. These firms, often referred to as the \"primes,\" had all of the contacts and, by extension, all the business.\n\nBut now, the door is opening for founders from the commercial world.\n\nEvents in the last few years — the invasion of Ukraine, the second Trump administration, and the rise of drone warfare — have jolted NATO militaries, who now fear an overreliance on the primes. European generals and politicians alike agree: To convince Russia that it would lose a war, the continent needs a steady stream of ammo and equipment that can be quickly designed, tweaked, and produced in large quantities.\n\n\"It's no longer possible to just adhere to the old pace of months and years of planning, months or years of procurement, months or years of development,\" a spokesperson for Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic, or DIANA, the NATO agency that connected Kelluu with alliance members, told me.\n\nNATO conceptualized DIANA before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, as a program for emerging firms to present their tech to allied militaries and potentially sign contracts. Following the outbreak of the war, the agency was established in 2023.\n\nThe agency said it received 4,000 applications for its next cohort, up from 2,400 last year and 1,200 in its inaugural batch in 2023. At least half of these firms and founders are from Europe.\n\nInvestors who once viewed the defense sector as taboo are scouring the industry. According to the NATO Innovation Fund in February, venture capital investments in European defense tech reached $1 billion in 2024, up by four times since 2020.\n\nI traveled in the fall of 2025 to northern Europe, where concerns about war with Russia run high, to speak with defense startups finding their corner of a market that was closed to them five years ago. To make it in the old defense world, small firms typically needed to be bought by a prime.\n\nWith that barrier fading, the founders I spoke to have set their ambitions high. The European Union has a new goal of allocating $920 billion more to defense by 2030, and NATO members are raising their commitment to spending 5% of GDP on their militaries.\n\n\"No wonder that even the US investors are now looking at the European landscape, which wasn't a thing a year ago,\" Hietala said.\n\nRead this collection to get to know some of the startups seeking a slice of Europe's expanding war chest:",

    "fullText": "(refiles to fix hyperlinks in paragraph 8, 14)\n\nDUBAI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Iran's leadership warned of a regional conflict on Sunday if the U.S. were to attack it, stoking the tension between Washington and Tehran, and it ​designated EU armies as \"terrorist groups\" in a retaliatory move.\n\nThe United States has ramped up its naval presence in the ‌Middle East after President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened Iran with intervention if it did not agree to a nuclear deal or failed to stop killing protesters.\n\nDespite the ‌standoff between Iran's clerical rulers and the Trump administration, both sides have signalled they are ready to resume talks, and regional allies such as Turkey have sought de-escalation.\n\nAn Iranian official denied an earlier report by state-run Press TV that the Revolutionary Guards' naval forces would carry out live-fire exercises in the Strait of Hormuz on Sunday and Monday, telling Reuters they have no such plan and the media ⁠reports are wrong.\n\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ‌was quoted on state media as saying that although Trump says he has sent ships to the region, \"the Iranian nation shall not be scared by these things, the Iranian people will not be stirred ‍by these threats\".\n\n\"We are not the initiators and do not want to attack any country, but the Iranian nation will strike a strong blow against anyone who attacks and harasses them,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. Navy currently has six destroyers, one aircraft carrier, and three littoral combat ships in ​the region, raising the risk of war after Iran's deadly crackdown in January on nationwide protests against Iranian leadership.\n\nTrump was weighing ‌options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces, Reuters has reported, citing multiple sources.\n\nOn Saturday Trump told reporters that Iran was \"seriously talking\" with Washington, hours after Tehran's top security official Ali Larijani said on X that arrangements for negotiations were underway.\n\nTrump also said: \"I hope they negotiate something acceptable. You could make a negotiated deal that would be satisfactory with no nuclear weapons.\"\n\nTehran says it is ready for \"fair\" negotiations that do not seek to curtail its defensive capabilities.\n\nThe protests, which started over economic hardships but morphed ⁠into the most acute political challenge to the Islamic Republic since its ​establishment in 1979, have now abated after repression.\n\nOfficial numbers put the unrest-related death ​toll at 3,117, while U.S.-based HRANA rights group said on Sunday it had so far verified the death of 6,713 people. Reuters was unable to independently verify the numbers.\n\nIn a symbolic shift in response to ‍the crackdown on protests, the European ⁠Union on Thursday designated the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation.\n\nIn retaliation on Sunday, Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf said EU armies would also be designated as such, and that authorities would deliberate on the expulsion of EU ⁠states' military attachés.\n\n\"By trying to hit the Revolutionary Guards... the Europeans actually shot themselves in the foot\" the speaker told fellow lawmakers, who all wore IRGC ‌uniforms in support of the elite force.\n\nAfter his address, lawmakers shouted \"Death to America, Shame on you Europe\".",

    "description": "Ukraine is showing how much drones can change the battle. But a British unit going all-in on them said much about war remains unchanged.",
    "fullText": "A British military unit that is leaning heavily into drones says that even though the technology may be the future of war, it probably won't fundamentally change most of infantry life as it is now, at least not anytime soon.\n\nThe Irish Guards, an elite infantry regiment within the British Army, have been preparing intensively to operate with drones after watching the heavy drone use in Ukraine and receiving advice from Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nBut Lt. Col Ben Irwin-Clark, the commanding officer of its 1st Battalion, told Business Insider that he believes most of an infantryman's job likely won't change even as drone technology proliferates.\n\n\"To me, it feels like 80% of the job of an infantryman is exactly the same and probably exactly the same as it was in a Napoleonic era,\" he said. \"You need to be fit. You need to be strong and robust. You need to be able to survive in the field. You need to be able to dig a hole.\"\n\n\"That hasn't changed,\" he said. \"I doubt it's going to change for a while longer.\"\n\nHe said that land warfare and infantry combat tend to be \"regressive,\" which is to say \"it doesn't matter how much technology you throw into the field, it doesn't matter how supremely trained your troops are. Sooner or later it ends up as two blokes in a muddy hole, slugging it out with a billhook or a spade.\"\n\n\"Once the tank's gone, you just regress to the next type of technology,\" he said — and eventually to soldiers on foot. \"So I don't think a huge majority of the job has changed.\"\n\nThat continuity, Irwin-Clark said, is reassuring rather than limiting. It means new technology can be layered onto an existing foundation rather than replacing it.\n\nStill, his unit is heavily embracing drones, driven by lessons from Ukraine and direct Ukrainian input.\n\nIrwin-Clark said that out of the 300 people in the battalion, 78 are now pilots or instructors. It has also created a \"drone hub,\" the first of its kind in the British Army, where soldiers can repair drones and develop new ones using tech like 3D printing, a technology it adopted on Ukrainian advice. It now uses drones in its exercises and has created a drone obstacle course for soldiers to train on.\n\nThe British officer isn't alone in his thinking on the impact of drones on war and the infantry.\n\nMaj. Rachel Martin, director of the US Army's Unmanned Advanced Lethality Course designed to help the service catch up on drone warfare, told Business Insider that \"yes, warfare, the tools of warfare are changing, but the fundamentals of warfare have not changed.\"\n\nDrones, she said, are \"just another tool with which to combat specific types of missions, but not necessarily all missions,\" and other weaponry that the US Army has had for much longer may still be able to accomplish missions better than drones can.\n\nShe said she wants soldiers to view drones \"as a tool with which to accomplish a mission, but it may not be the tool given a certain mission set.\"\n\nGen. James Rainey, the former head of Army Futures Command, said in 2024 that technology like drones was having a majorly disruptive effect on land warfare and was something the US needed to get ahead of, but he also said that war will \"always be a human endeavor.\"\n\nDrones may not dominate future Western wars as they do in Ukraine — where shortages forced heavy reliance on them — but NATO militaries are still investing in drones and training to ensure they're ready to use them where they make sense.\n\nEven though he doesn't see much of infantry life changing, Irwin-Clark still described drones as being part of \"the future of warfare.\"\n\nHe said that what surprised him most was how quickly his battalion's members picked up the technology.\n\n\"Everything else that you learned in the army is a sort of quite laborious process of fixed lessons, right?\" he said. He said that things are done by the book, because those styles of warfare have been around for so long that \"there is literally a book.\"\n\nAfter 20 years in the army, he was used to a more formulaic approach to training. But with drone warfare, \"you can't do that because the text's changing all the time and the types of drones are changing all the time.\" He was fearful as a result that it would take quite a while for the battalion to get it. Instead, he was \"pretty blown away\" by how quickly soldiers were confidently flying using drones.\n\nHe said that the men and women in the battalion \"are incredible and can pick that up really quickly. They're really adaptable, and they are really tech savvy.\"",

It was revived in the new millennium with Popeyes' launch of its chicken sandwich in August 2019.\n\nRival Chick-fil-A countered Popeyes' new sandwich with a statement on Twitter that its sandwich was the original, introduced in 1964, and fast-food chains everywhere began introducing or reintroducing chicken sandwiches.\n\nWith all of these chicken sandwiches launching, fried chicken restaurants became the most popular concept in fast food.\n\nFried chicken dining chains are likely to remain the most popular subsector of the fast-food industry in 2026, if the concept continues the trend it set over the last year.\n\nTraffic to chicken concepts rose 3% in the year ending September 2025, while all concepts dropped 1% compared to the previous year, according to market research firm Circana, as reported by Fast Company.\n\nThe variety of chicken options offered, such as chicken pieces, chicken fingers, or chicken sandwiches, and how consumers enjoy their choices, may contribute to the continued popularity of the concept, an expert says.\n\n“This is due to the experiences the brands are creating as well as the variety of chicken and how you can enjoy it,” industry expert Reilly Newman of Motif Brands told The Food Institute. “This comes to no surprise, as the experience economy has been taking root across the globe.\n\n“Chicken allows for (ample) customization, sauces, and forms, depending on the buyer’s preferences,” Newman said.\n\nNot every fast-food chicken restaurant benefited from increased traffic in 2025, as some operators suffered financial difficulties that led to bankruptcy filings.\n\nA bankrupt operator of more than 130 Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen franchise restaurants has closed 17 underperforming locations in Florida and Georgia and filed a motion to reject all of the stores' leases.\n\nThe franchisee, Sailormen Inc., which declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Jan. 15, filed a motion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida in Miami to reject the leases after closing eight locations on Jan. 19, five locations on Jan. 20, and four locations on Jan. 22, according to court papers.\n\nThe debtor asserts that the leases should be rejected as of the petition date, since the restaurants were closed within one week of the petition date and before the hearing on the debtor's first-day motions.",

    "title": "Russia's Oil Revenue, the Lifeblood of Its War Machine, Is Plummeting",
    "description": "The new reality has forced the Kremlin to raise taxes and increase debt, and hovers over peace talks with Ukraine.",
    "fullText": "As Russia holds direct peace talks with Ukraine for the first time in months, the Kremlin’s most potent fuel for the war, oil revenue, is under mounting strain.\n\nThe price of Russian oil, the country’s primary export, has declined under the weight of surging global supplies and Western sanctions related to the war. Last year, Russia’s oil and gas revenue fell by almost a quarter, according to the Finance Ministry. The Kremlin is resorting to tax increases and deficit spending to bridge the gap.\n\nSo far, there is little sign that the economic strains, and any discontent they generate among business leaders and the public, will be enough to change President Vladimir V. Putin’s calculations on the war. Trilateral negotiations involving Russia, Ukraine and the United States are set to continue on Sunday in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nBut with the economy stagnating and the Kremlin reaching the limit of what it can squeeze from it, the Russian people will have to bear more of the burden of a war whose costs exceed about $170 billion a year.\n\n“This situation is manageable,” said Yevgeny Nadorshin, an economist in Moscow who advises companies and banks. “But no one is comfortable with that.”\n\nThroughout his decades-long rule, Mr. Putin has taken pride in the stability he has brought to a Russian economy that was in free fall after the demise of the Soviet Union — slashing debt, streamlining taxes and taming inflation.\n\nA strong oil economy allowed the Russian state to deliver an improved standard of living. That, the Kremlin hoped, would keep the public content even as the government eroded personal freedoms.\n\nNow, the carefully cultivated economic stability is fracturing. The steep drop in oil revenue has sent Russia into a new era defined by sustained budget deficits, higher taxes and stubborn inflation.\n\nRussia’s oil trade has been battered by two forces. Oil prices have declined since April, after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided to gradually increase production after years of cuts. The Russian oil industry has also been hit in recent months by new Western sanctions and the heavier enforcement of existing ones.\n\nIn October, President Trump imposed sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft, which is state-owned, and Lukoil, which is private. Those penalties significantly undercut the companies’ ability to sell crude. Since then, Russia has also faced stepped-up enforcement of restrictions against the illicit “shadow fleet” of tankers it uses to ship oil.\n\nThis month, the U.S. military seized a Russian-flagged vessel in the North Atlantic that had been used to carry Venezuelan oil. The French Navy also intercepted a tanker in the Mediterranean suspected of using a false flag and belonging to a Russia-linked fleet.\n\nBecause of the current global oversupply, buyers now have more alternatives to Russian crude. This allows them to either walk away entirely or demand significantly higher discounts to compensate for the risk of handling goods hit with sanctions, said Sergey Vakulenko, an energy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n“Had it not been for this noticeable decrease in oil prices,” he said, “all these measures would have been far less effective.”\n\nDiscounts on Russian oil have grown drastically. The economy ministry said this month that the average price of Russian oil was $39 per barrel in December, down from more than $57 in August.\n\nAdding to Moscow’s problems, Ukraine has been using drones since November to strike Russia-linked tankers in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. The Ukrainian military has also been attacking Russian refineries. That has contributed to fuel crises in several regions, forcing the government to temporarily ban the export of oil products.\n\n“The only factor that can change the situation is economic pressure on Russia,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on Friday. “Russia must run out of money for the war to start coming to an end.”\n\nThis is not the first time that Mr. Putin has dealt with a drop in oil prices. But in previous years, the Russian state had more options. It could cut expenditures or allow the currency to weaken to replenish the budget. But the costs of the war, which amount to about 30 percent of Russia’s $580 billion annual budget, make it hard to reduce expenses. And the currency, the ruble, has remained strong.\n\nPropped up by restrictions on imports and high interest rates, the ruble surged by about 45 percent against the U.S. dollar in 2025. A strong ruble means that the government receives less money for each barrel of crude that is sold.\n\nWith options dwindling, the Kremlin had little choice but to increase state debt as well as personal and corporate taxes. The Russian government also increased taxes on smaller enterprises like bakeries and shops, causing a rare uproar among owners.\n\nRussia’s budget deficit reached $72 billion in 2025, nominally the highest since 2009. Mr. Nadorshin, the economist, said he expected it to increase further this year.\n\n“The situation is becoming more complicated,” he said, “and it’s clear that the pace of this complication is, naturally, worrying.”",

    "description": "Find out more about King Charles' reaction to Prince Harry calling out Donald Trump following his claims about NATO allies on SheFinds.com",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump recently made claims that British soldiers stayed “off the front lines” during the war in Afghanistan, and his comments struck a chord, especially with Prince Harry, who served for over a decade in the British Army. The 41-year-old didn’t waste any time calling out the United States president, but his father, King Charles, reportedly wishes his son reacted differently. Keep reading \n\nAccording to Royal reporter Rob Shuter, Harry's very public reaction to Donald Trump's claims has put King Charles in a \"deeply uncomfortable\" position, especially ahead of King Charles and Queen Camilla's upcoming trip to the United States. Shuter reported that Charles \"understands the emotion, but he's horrified by the timing.\"\n\n\"This is diplomacy—not podcast politics,\" an insider told Shuter. \"Harry's comments make an already sensitive situation far trickier. The King can't clap back—even if he agrees.\"\n\nIn an interview with Fox News last week, Donald Trump questioned if the NATO allies would \"be there\" if the United States \"ever needed them.\"\n\n\"I've always said, 'Will they be there, if we ever needed them?' And that's really the ultimate test. And I'm not sure of that. I know that we would have been there, or we would be there, but will they be there?\" he questioned.\n\n\"We've never needed them,\" he continued. \"We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that. And they did—they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.\"\n\nThese claims from Donald Trump angered many members of the NATO alliance, including England. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called Trump's claims \"insulting and frankly appalling,\" and even Prince Harry had more than a few words to say about it.\n\nThrough a spokesperson, Prince Harry released a statement on the topic. \"In 2001, NATO invoked Article 5 for the first—and only—time in history,\" he said, referencing the mutual defense clause that was activated following the September 11, 2001 attacks. \"It meant that every allied nation was obliged to stand with the United States in Afghanistan, in pursuit of our shared security. Allies answered that call.\"\n\n\"I served there. I made lifelong friends there. And I lost friends there,\" he continued. \"The United Kingdom alone had 457 service personnel killed. Thousands of lives were changed forever. Mothers and fathers buried sons and daughters. Children were left without a parent. Families are left carrying the cost.\"\n\n\"Those sacrifices deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect, as we all remain united and loyal to the defense of diplomacy and peace,\" he finished. Prince Harry has long since been a supporter and defender of British veterans, having founded the Invictus Games in 2014, an international, Paralympic-style event for wounded, injured, and sick military service personnel and veterans.",

    "title": "Darren Aronofsky's New AI Series About the Revolutionary War Looks Like Dogshit",
    "description": "\"Used to be that when Darren Aronofsky wanted to feature a dead-eyed actor, he'd just employ Jared Leto.\"",
    "fullText": "Darren Aronofsky used to be a director who made interesting, if sometimes polarizing, films like Black Swan, Mother!, Noah, and The Wrestler. But it seems like a safe bet that people won’t need to debate whether Aronofsky’s new project is any good. Because anyone with eyes can see that it looks like low-effort AI slop. To put it another way, it looks like absolute dogshit.\n\nAronofsky is producing a new short-form series with his AI production company Primordial Soup titled “On This Day… 1776,” according to the Hollywood Reporter. The series uses tech from Google DeepMind to create short videos about the Revolutionary War, published on the YouTube channel for Time magazine. In 2018, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff bought Time, and the cloud software giant is sponsoring this monstrosity of a series.\n\nThe series uses human voice actors who belong to the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), which is clearly an attempt to tamp down on the inevitable backlash from both inside and outside Hollywood. Folks inside the movie and TV industry have fiercely pushed back against the use of AI to replace the skilled artists and actors who create the media we watch. That concern obviously comes from a place of self-interest because nobody wants to be pushed out of a job. But they also care about the quality of the work being produced. And there’s also been a revolt among the average consumer, people who’ve been inundated with the lowest-grade AI garbage imaginable. It’s really everywhere now.\n\nThe first episode, titled “The Flag,” is three-and-a-half minutes long and attempts to tell the story of George Washington raising the Continental Union Flag in Somerville, Massachusetts. It offers nothing compelling in the way of narrative. It’s the kind of thing that you’d skip over as a cut-scene in a particularly bad video game.\n\nEverything has a dead and creepy quality, as the actors’ audio is poorly synced with the lips of the AI concoctions.\n\nHave you ever seen a Spaghetti Western from the 1960s where the audio just doesn’t seem to match, even though it was clearly shot with actors speaking English, and the “dub” is in English? That happened because the audio was added in post-production, a result of direct sound recording being expensive in Italy during the post-war era. You get the same effect here, though there’s no good reason. Well, no good reason outside of presumably saving a ton of money on hiring human actors.\n\nThe second episode, titled “Common Sense,” tries to tell the story of Thomas Paine writing Common Sense. Benjamin Franklin makes an appearance, though it proves that the most recognizable of the founding fathers in this series are the weirdest to look at.\n\nThe episode jumps around incoherently, much like the first episode, without grounding the viewer in anything we should care about. It’s truly an ugly mess. And if you bother to pause the scenes, you can spot the kind of telltale anomalies that plague other AI-generated video projects, like strangely deformed hands in the background characters. Hands are always giving this stuff away.\n\nThen there are the words that appear on screen in the trailer, like the pamphlet that’s supposed to include the word “America” but instead reads something closer to “Λamereedd.”\n\nHappy to see that there is no need to worry about the historical accuracy of new 1776 AI slop because it happens in the mystical land of Λamereedd.\n\n— Mateusz Fafinski (@calthalas.bsky.social) January 29, 2026 at 1:33 PM\n\nThe series is specifically made for this sestercentennial year of America’s founding, and each episode will reportedly drop on the 250th anniversary of the day it happened, according to the Hollywood Reporter. And that’s certainly a fun concept if the final product were something worth watching. But it’s not. It’s garbage. The people who are making and distributing it obviously don’t think so.\n\n“This project is a glimpse at what thoughtful, creative, artist-led use of AI can look like — not replacing craft, but expanding what’s possible and allowing storytellers to go places they simply couldn’t before,” Ben Bitonti, president of Time Studios, told the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe reaction on social media hasn’t been so kind. “I know my expectations were low but holy fuck Darren Aronofsky producing AI slop wasn’t on my bingo card,” one X user wrote. Over on Bluesky another joked, “Used to be that when Darren Aronofsky wanted to feature a dead-eyed actor, he’d just employ Jared Leto.”\n\nAnd other users have been picking apart all the anomalies, with one Bluesky critic writing: “Love the new Aronofsky scene where the colonist takes off his hat to cheer, revealing that underneath it was a second and somehow larger hat.”\n\nLove the new Aronofsky scene where the colonist takes off his hat to cheer, revealing that underneath it was a second and somehow larger hat\n Masterful artsistic choice\n\n— Matt Baume 🏳️‍🌈 (@mattbaume.bsky.social) January 29, 2026 at 10:35 AM\n\n“Nothing represents The End of America after a 250-year run quite like using AI slop to depict the creation of the Declaration of Independence,” another user quipped.\n\nThe videos have been up at Time’s YouTube channel for over 7 hours as of the time of this writing, but they’re not gaining much attention in their original format. The first episode has just 5,000 views. The second episode has a little over 2,000. Social media posts ridiculing the production seem to be faring better, simply because people are making fun of them. One video on Bluesky has over 2,500 quote posts, with almost all seemingly making jokes about how awful it looks.\n\nGizmodo reached out to Ken Burns for comment, but didn’t immediately receive a reply.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A new report warns that the number of soldiers killed, injured or missing on both sides of Russia's war on Ukraine could hit 2 million by the spring, with Russia suffering the largest number of troop deaths recorded for any major power in any conflict since World War II.\n\nTuesday's report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies came less than a month before the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nAs the war grinds through another bitterly cold winter, Russian strikes hit an apartment block Wednesday on the outskirts of Kyiv, killing two people. Nine others were injured in attacks in the Ukrainian cities of Odesa and Kryvyi Rih and the front-line Zaporizhzhia region.\n\nThe CSIS report said Russia suffered 1.2 million casualties, including up to 325,000 troop deaths, between February 2022 and December 2025.\n\n“Despite claims of battlefield momentum in Ukraine, the data shows that Russia is paying an extraordinary price for minimal gains and is in decline as a major power,” the report said. “No major power has suffered anywhere near these numbers of casualties or fatalities in any war since World War II.\"\n\nIt estimated that Ukraine, with its smaller army and population, had suffered between 500,000 to 600,000 military casualties, including up to 140,000 deaths.\n\nNeither Moscow nor Kyiv gives timely data on military losses, and each side seeks to amplify the other side’s casualties.\n\nCommenting on the report, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that the research could not be considered “reliable information” and that only Russia’s Ministry of Defense was authorized to provide information on military losses.\n\nThe ministry’s last statement on battlefield deaths was in September 2022, when it said that just under 6,000 Russian soldiers had been killed. It has not released any updated figures since then.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn an interview with NBC in February 2025, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that more than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since the war began.\n\nThe report estimated that at current rates, combined Russian and Ukrainian casualties may be as high as 1.8 million and could reach 2 million by spring.\n\nThe figures from the CSIS were compiled using the Washington, D.C.-based think tank’s own analysis, data published by independent Russian news site Mediazona with the BBC, estimates by the British government and interviews with state officials.\n\nReports about military losses have been repressed in Russian media, activists and independent journalists say.\n\nMediazona, together with the BBC and a team of volunteers, has so far collected the names of over 160,000 troops killed by scouring news reports, social media and government websites.\n\nThe report also said that Russian forces were advancing at a sluggish pace since they seized the initiative on the battlefield in 2024, despite their much larger size.\n\nRussia’s advance in Ukraine has largely settled into a grinding war of attrition, and analysts say that Russian President Vladimir Putin is in no rush to find a settlement, despite his army’s difficulties on the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line.\n\nThe report said Russian forces have advanced at an average rate of between 15 and 70 meters (49 to 230 feet) per day in their most prominent offensives.\n\nThat is “slower than almost any major offensive campaign in any war in the last century,” the report said.\n\nPutin told his annual news conference last month that 700,000 Russian troops are fighting in Ukraine. He gave the same number in 2024, and a slightly lower figure — 617,000 — in December 2023. It was not possible to verify those figures.\n\n2 killed in attack in Kyiv region\n\nOfficials said Wednesday that two people were killed near the Ukrainian capital and at least nine others were injured in attacks across Ukraine.\n\nA man and a woman died in an overnight attack in the Bilohorodka area on the outskirts of Kyiv, according to Mykola Kalashnyk, head of the regional military administration.\n\nOfficials in the Ukrainian cities of Odesa and Kryvyi Rih, as well as the Zaporizhzhia region, also reported Russian strikes overnight, wounding at least nine people and damaging infrastructure.\n\nUkraine's air force said that Russia attacked overnight with one ballistic missile and 146 strike drones, 103 of which were shot down or destroyed using electronic warfare.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's Ministry of Defense said its air defenses destroyed 75 Ukrainian drones overnight. Twenty-four were shot down over Russia’s southwestern Krasnodar region, with 23 more shot down over the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed in 2016.\n\nTwo drones were reportedly shot down over Russia's Voronezh region, where Ukraine's General Staff said Wednesday that it had struck the Khokholskaya oil depot. Regional Gov. Alexander Gusev wrote on Telegram that falling drone debris sparked a fire involving oil products, but did not give further details.",

    "title": "Ukrainian drone schools say there's little the West can teach them about fighting a drone war",
    "description": "Ukraine's drone schools are closely following the fast-developing drone battle and say their expertise only comes from Ukrainians, not Western allies.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian drone schools say that Western militaries have little to offer them when it comes to training drone operators to fight Russia. Western armies know war, tactics, and combat power, but Ukraine has significant experience in novel elements of modern drone warfare learned over years of hard fighting.\n\nDrones of all kinds are used \n\nWhile drones are not new to Western militaries, they have never been used or adapted at this scale or speed. Facing an existential adapt-or-die situation, Ukraine is writing its own lessons.\n\nUkraine has a host of drone schools that have designed curricula to make the country's operators as effective as possible. And officials at three of them told Business Insider that their lessons are only informed by Ukrainian experiences.\n\n\"As of today, we do not receive any particularly useful information from our allies regarding the use of drones,\" other than training on any equipment that allies provide, one said.\n\nVitalii Pervak, CEO of another training school, Karlsson, Karas & Associates, said that said 100% of his school's teachings come from feedback or information from soldiers who are in the field.\n\nOne example he gave was in stopping enemy drones: \"All experience in striking down drones is based only on the experience of the Ukrainian Defense Forces.\"\n\nHe said there isn't time for theoretical tactics that may not work when needed most. \"We are in a situation where we need to respond quickly to new drones and the tactics of their use by the enemy,\" he said. \"Accordingly, techniques are being tested in practice, and only those techniques that really work are being retained.\"\n\nAnother drone school, Dronarium, said the school's training \"is based on existing combat experience, which changes very rapidly.\"\n\nBecause of that pace, instructors said Ukraine is often better positioned to share lessons than to receive them. \"In this sense, at the moment it is rather us who can share valuable information with them, rather than our foreign partners sharing it with us,\" Anastasia Sobova, Dronarium Academy's chief business development officer, told BI.\n\nUkrainian soldiers have been receiving Western training throughout the war, with mixed feedback. Some has been well received, while other elements have been deemed irrelevant to the kind of fighting Ukraine faces now.\n\nUkraine's troops say combat tactics can become out of date in a matter of only weeks; the drone war is no different.\n\nMatt McCrann, CEO of the US arm of DroneShield, a company making counter-drone systems for the US and Europe, recently told Business Insider that the speed of battlefield changes has shifted weapon development cycles from months and years to weeks.\n\nThings change so fast on the battlefield that the schools need to frequently rewrite their lessons, sometimes as fast as every other week.\n\nThese drone schools stay on top of changes by sending their instructors to the front, maintaining constant contact with program graduates and other soldiers who send updates from the battlefield, and testing new technology.\n\nViktor Taran, the CEO of the Kruk Drones UAV training center, said that his school's graduates exchange messages with the school to share new information about what's happening on the battlefield or get advice from teachers.\n\n\"Cadets go to the front line, type questions in those chats, or provide information about new enemy tactics.\" The information they get from those on the front line goes into the teaching for the next groups.\n\nPervak said in his school, \"We constantly update our instructors' knowledge. Some instructors occasionally visit combat units of the UAV to see firsthand what has changed, what remains relevant, and what can be discarded.\"\n\nMany Western militaries, including the US, acknowledge they are behind on drone warfare and that their tactics need updating. It is an area where Ukraine is helping partner nations that have assisted it in its defense.\n\nWestern and NATO militaries are closely watching the war, concerned that Russia could threaten Europe and that drones would play a major role in any wider conflict. That worry has intensified efforts to learn from Ukraine's experience, particularly in drone operations and counter-drone tactics. The Ukrainians are attempting to meet that demand for expertise.\n\nUkraine agreed to help Poland with drone warfare training and has helped train Norway's drone operators.\n\nUkrainian military specialists traveled to Denmark to participate in counter-drone exercises. Copenhagen said in April it intended to send unarmed soldiers to Ukraine for drone warfare training, though it is unclear if that has taken place.\n\nThe UK says Ukraine has influenced its drone doctrine as well. Britain leads an international effort to train Ukrainian troops, known as Operation Interflex, and those Ukrainian soldiers often arrive with more real-world drone experience than their trainers.\n\nLt. Col. Ben Irwin-Clark, commanding officer of the 1st Battalion of the UK's Irish Guards, told Business Insider that one surprise from the training was \"how much we would learn.\" His unit now trains in drone warfare and 3D printing drone parts based on Ukrainian lessons.\n\nPervak described sharing expertise as a way to repay allies for their support. \"Not forgetting the fact that we are truly grateful for the remarkable support from our allies, it is time now to share our latest battlefield experience.\"\n\nDrones might not dominate a NATO war against Russia to the same extent they do in Ukraine — in part because Western militaries possess capabilities Ukraine lacks — but they are no longer viewed as a niche tool. Ukraine's experience has led to a realization that this tech may very well be the future of warfare.",

    "fullText": "TOKYO/BEIJING, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said Japan's strategic alliance with the U.S. would collapse if Tokyo were to turn away from a conflict in Taiwan, but ​distanced herself from previous comments that suggested a possible military response in such an event.\n\nTakaichi expressed ‌her latest views on a nationally broadcast TV programme late on Monday, where an opposition party leader criticised her for igniting ‌tensions with China with the earlier remarks.\n\nTies between Japan and China have sunk to the worst level in years after Takaichi said in November that a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could bring about a Japanese military response. Beijing has responded with export curbs, flight cancellations and vitriolic commentaries, repeatedly demanding a retraction.\n\nChina claims sovereignty ⁠over the democratically-governed island of Taiwan.\n\n“I ‌want to make it absolutely clear that this is not about Japan going out and taking military action if China and the United States come into conflict (over ‍Taiwan),\" Takaichi said on the live TV show, referring to the comments she made in parliament in November.\n\n\"If something serious happens there, we would have to go to rescue the Japanese and American citizens in Taiwan. In that situation, ​there may be cases where we take joint action.\n\n\"And if the U.S. forces, acting jointly with us, ‌come under attack and Japan does nothing and simply runs away, the Japan–U.S. alliance would collapse. So we would respond strictly within the limits of the law — within the limits of the laws as they currently exist — while making a comprehensive judgment based on what is happening on the ground.\"\n\nJAPAN'S CONSTITUTION PROHIBITS DIRECT MILITARY ACTION\n\nWith an eye on the electorate, Takaichi has stopped short of retracting the ⁠remarks from November, saying her stance was consistent with ​Japan's long-standing policy. She has also said that China’s characterisation of ​her remarks was inconsistent with the facts.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday urged Japan to \"earnestly reflect and correct its mistakes, and to stop its manipulation and reckless actions on ‍the Taiwan issue.\"\n\nJapan's pacifist constitution ⁠prohibits direct military action but allows it to exercise the right of collective self-defence, or defending the United States or another friendly country that comes under attack, in cases where Japan faces ⁠a \"threat to its survival.\"\n\nTakaichi has enjoyed high approval ratings since taking office in October 2025 and has called a snap election ‌on February 8, hoping to capitalise on her popularity.",

For immigrants hoping for a better life, it's a simplified path to citizenship.\n\nAll they have to do is sign a contract to fight in Ukraine.\n\nAs Russia seeks to replenish its forces in nearly four years of war — and avoid an unpopular nationwide mobilization — it's pulling out all the stops to find new troops to send into the battlefield.\n\nSome come from abroad to fight in what has become a bloody war of attrition. After signing a mutual defense treaty with Moscow in 2024, North Korea sent thousands of soldiers to help Russia defend its Kursk region from a Ukrainian incursion.\n\nMen from South Asian countries, including India, Nepal and Bangladesh, complain of being duped into signing up to fight by recruiters promising jobs. Officials in Kenya, South Africa and Iraq say the same has happened to citizens from their countries.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin told his annual news conference last month that 700,000 Russian troops are fighting in Ukraine. He gave the same number in 2024, and a slightly lower figure – 617,000 – in December 2023. It's unclear if those numbers are accurate.\n\nStill hidden are the numbers of military casualties, with Moscow having released limited official figures. The British Defense Ministry said last summer that more than 1 million Russian troops may have been killed or wounded.\n\nIndependent Russian news site Mediazona, together with the BBC and a team of volunteers, scoured news reports, social media and government websites and collected the names of over 160,000 troops killed. More than 550 of those were foreigners from over two dozen countries.\n\nUnlike Ukraine, where martial law and nationwide mobilization has been in place since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Putin has resisted ordering a broad call-up.\n\nWhen a limited mobilization of 300,000 men was tried later that year, tens of thousands of people fled abroad. The effort stopped after a few weeks when the target was met, but a Putin decree left the door open for another call-up. It also made all military contracts effectively open-ended and barred soldiers from quitting service or being discharged, unless they reached certain age limits or were incapacitated by injuries.\n\nSince then, Moscow has largely relied on what it describes as voluntary enlistment.\n\nThe flow of voluntary enlistees signing military contracts has remained strong, topping 400,000 last year, Putin said in December. It was not possible to independently verify the claim. Similar numbers were announced in 2024 and 2023.\n\nActivists say these contracts often stipulate a fixed term of service, such as one year, leading some potential enlistees to believe the commitment is temporary. But contracts are automatically extended indefinitely, they say.\n\nThe government offers high pay and extensive benefits to enlistees. Regional authorities offer various enlistment bonuses, sometimes amounting to tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nIn the Khanty-Mansi region of central Russia, for example, an enlistee would get about $50,000 in various bonuses, according to the local government. That's more than twice the average annual income in the region, where monthly salaries in the first 10 months of 2025 were reported to be just over $1,600.\n\nThere also are tax breaks, debt relief and other perks.\n\nDespite Kremlin claims of relying on voluntary enlistment, media reports and rights groups say conscripts — men aged 18-30 performing fixed-term mandatory military service and exempted from being sent to Ukraine — are often coerced by superiors into signing contracts that send them into battle.\n\nRecruitment also extends to prisoners and those in pretrial detention centers, a practice led early in the war by the late mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin and adopted by the Defense Ministry. Laws now allow recruitment of both convicts and suspects in criminal cases.\n\nForeigners also are recruiting targets, both inside Russia and abroad.\n\nLaws were adopted offering accelerated Russian citizenship for enlistees. Russian media and activists also report that raids in areas where migrants typically live or work lead to them being pressuring into military service, with new citizens sent to enlistment offices to determine if they’re eligible for mandatory service.\n\nIn November, Putin decreed that military service was mandatory for certain foreigners seeking permanent residency.\n\nSome reportedly are lured to Russia by trafficking rings promising jobs, then duping them into signing military contracts. Cuban authorities in 2023 identified and sought to dismantle one such ring operating from Russia.\n\nNepal’s Foreign Minister Narayan Prakash Saud told The Associated Press in 2024 that his country asked Russia to return hundreds of Nepali nationals who were recruited to fight in Ukraine, as well as to repatriate the remains of those killed in the war. Nepal has since barred citizens from traveling to Russia or Ukraine for work, citing recruitment efforts.\n\nAlso in 2024, India’s federal investigation agency said it broke up a network that lured at least 35 of its citizens to Russia under the pretext of employment. The men were trained for combat and deployed to Ukraine against their will, with some \"grievously injured,” the agency said.\n\nWhen Putin hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for talks in 2024, New Delhi said its nationals who were “misled” into joining the Russian army would be discharged.\n\nIraqi officials say about 5,000 of its citizens have joined the Russian military along with an unspecified number who are fighting alongside Ukrainian forces. Officials in Baghdad cracked down on such recruiting networks, with one man convicted last year of human trafficking and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nAn unknown number of Iraqis have been killed or gone missing while fighting in Ukraine. Some families have reported that relatives were lured to Russia under false pretenses and forced to enlist; in other cases, Iraqis have joined voluntarily for the salary and Russian citizenship.\n\nForeigners duped into fighting are especially vulnerable because they don’t speak Russian, have no military experience and are deemed “dispensable, to put it bluntly,” by military commanders, said Anton Gorbatsevich of the activist group Idite Lesom, or “Get Lost,” which helps men desert from the army.\n\nThis month, a Ukrainian agency for the treatment of prisoners of war said over 18,000 foreign nationals had fought or are fighting on the Russian side. Almost 3,400 have been killed, and hundreds of citizens of 40 countries are held in Ukraine as POWs.\n\nIf true, that represents a fraction of the 700,000 troops that Putin said are fighting for Russia in Ukraine.\n\nUsing foreigners is only one way to meet the constant demand, said Artyom Klyga, head of the legal department at the Movement of Conscientious Objectors, noting Russian recruitment efforts appear to be stable. Most of those seeking help from the group, which assists men in avoiding military service, are Russian citizens, he said.\n\nKateryna Stepanenko, a Russia researcher at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, said the Kremlin has gotten more “creative” in the last two years with attracting enlistees, including foreigners.\n\nBut recruitment efforts are becoming “extremely expensive” for Russia, which faces a slowing economy, she added.",

    "fullText": "KENNESAW, Ga. (AP) — As a deadly storm that brought crippling ice to the South and deep snow to the Northeast finally began to swirl out to sea Monday, it represented light at the end of the tunnel for some.\n\nBut thousands of Americans were still without power or heat, and temperatures were forecast to plunge well below freezing by early Tuesday in areas where the ice storm did its worst damage.\n\nMore than 800,000 power outages were reported nationwide Monday morning, with more than 150,000 of them in the Nashville, Tennessee, area, according to poweroutage.com. About 140,000 remained without power in hard-hit Mississippi, and 115,000 \n\nAfter a sleepless night in Iuka, Mississippi, Adrian Ronca-Hohn said he awoke Monday to what looked \"like a war zone.”\n\n“We couldn’t go 10 seconds without hearing what sounded like a gunshot,\" the 23-year-old football coach said of falling trees and branches. “You’d hear a pop, a hard pop, and you’d hear the whistle of it falling, and then it would crash to the ground and just kind of explode.”\n\nAs temperatures across the South are expected to reach their coldest this week early Tuesday morning, people without power are trying to survive.\n\n“We have a lot of people without heat, without power and without water,\" Ronca-Hohn said. We have a lot of mobile homes down here that aren’t very well-insulated.\"\n\nHere's a look at the storm by the numbers.\n\nOne inch of ice (2.5 centimeters) recorded in multiple communities across Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Alabama, and South Carolina.\n\nThe temperature in Fahrenheit (minus 17 Celsius) that’s expected early Tuesday morning in Tennessee’s capital city, where thousands remain without power.\n\nInches of sleet (17 centimeters) that fell at Clinton National Airport in Little Rock, Arkansas, according to preliminary totals.\n\nThe number of days it could take to restore power in Allen County, Kentucky, city officials said. Other communities estimated similar time frames. In New Albany, Mississippi, the city utility warned Sunday that restoring power to all its customers “will take a minimum of a week and possibly more depending on conditions.”\n\nInches of snow (56.4 centimeters) that fell during the storm in Sterling, Massachusetts. The number is a preliminary figure through Monday morning.\n\nThe number of places in Nashville where people without power can go to warm up and charge their phones, including fire and police stations.\n\nThe temperature in Fahrenheit (50 Celsius) inside Marshall Ramsey’s home in Oxford, Mississippi, on Monday morning after he lost power. The weekend ice storm “was like a demonic symphony of trees breaking, transformers blowing and thunder,” said Ramsey, a longtime editorial cartoonist who now teaches at the University of Mississippi.\n\nThe number of dogs rescued from a rural property in the Tupelo, Mississippi, area just before the ice storm by Paws of War. The New York-based nonprofit rescues animals and places them with veterans and first responders.\n\nThe number of customers without power in Mississippi on Monday afternoon, according to poweroutage.com.\n\nThe number of Nashville Electric Service customers without power in the Nashville area on Monday afternoon, according to the company.\n\nThe number of customers without power in Tennessee on Monday afternoon, according to poweroutage.com.",

    "fullText": "MAGA podcaster Tim Pool has called out President Donald Trump in the fallout of the second fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by Department of Homeland Security federal officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in less than three weeks.\n\nThe Culture War podcast host and longtime Trump suck-up has questioned the Trump administration’s narrative surrounding the killing of ICU nurse Alex Jeffrey Pretti, 37, arguing that Trump is “weak” in the face of the ensuing chaos that is gripping the Twin Cities.\n\n“Empty hand, then gun in hand,” Pool wrote, commenting on slowed footage in the seconds surrounding Pretti’s shooting. “Appears the man may have been disarmed before being shot.”\n\n“This is a chain of events in a greater conflict. Neither side cares at this point what justifies it or doesn’t.\n\n“I don’t see Trump winning this one,” Pool concluded.\n\nPool, 39, heads his own independent media group, Timcast, and has some 2.5 million followers on X. His podcast covers right-wing talking points and conspiracy theories, and has hosted white supremacist Nick Fuentes and alt-right figure Milo Yiannopoulos.\n\nDHS has said that the agents involved in the shooting acted in self-defence after the “armed suspect violently resisted.”\n\n“Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, an agent fired defensive shots,” the department wrote in an official statement.\n\n“The suspect also had 2 magazines and no ID—this looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.\"\n\nDHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a press conference that she agrees with the White House’s statement that Pretti was a “domestic terrorist.”\n\n“This individual... committed an act of domestic terrorism. That’s the facts,” Noem argued.\n\nSimilar statements have been made by Trump’s closest political allies—including Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, who branded Pretti an “assassin”—as the administration closes ranks to unify on its messaging.\n\nPool appears not to be buying any of it, although he has not entirely flipped sides. In a separate tweet, the commentator argued that those impeding the work of “federal agents dispatched by a duly elected government” are “fascists.”\n\n“Trump should personally go to Minneapolis and force the whole thing to shut down, no more fighting, no more partisan conflict,” Pool argued.\n\n“Trump isn’t Lincoln, he’s Buchanan.”\n\nPresident James Buchanan is frequently cited as the worst leader in U.S. history. The 15th president, serving from 1857 to 1861, failed to stop the country from tearing itself apart, leading to the Civil War.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz has also spurned the official White House narrative surrounding the events in his state’s capital, branding them “nonsense” and “lies.”\n\nPretti’s own parents have said that the Trump administration is spreading “sickening lies” about their deceased son that are “reprehensible and disgusting.”\n\nVideo analysis from news networks, including CNN and Bellingcat, has concluded that federal officers took the gun from the licensed firearm holder Pretti before shooting him at least 10 times while he was on the ground.\n\nProtests have engulfed Minnesota since the fatal shooting of 37-year-old mother of three, Renee Good, who was also killed by federal agents, not far from where today’s shooting took place.\n\nThe National Guard of Minnesota has been activated in Minneapolis as authorities work to ensure the ongoing protests remain peaceful.",

    "description": "For a long time the question has been asked: if China decides to invade Taiwan, can it be stopped by the US?",
    "fullText": "For a long time the question has been asked: if China decides to invade Taiwan, can it be stopped by the US?\n\nIn short, is the US still the world’s sole superpower, able to dictate terms to Beijing even just off the China coast – or can the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) now bring the long-standing “Pax Americana”, the rules-based international order, to a conclusive end?\n\nWe may find out quite soon now, even as Sir Keir Starmer travels to Beijing this week to break bread with Xi Jinping. Last week, away from the slopes of Davos and largely unnoticed outside the shipping industry, the geopolitical order shifted significantly. A bulk cargo ship named Winning Youth arrived in China carrying 200,000 tons of iron ore.\n\nBig cargoes of iron ore arrive in China all the time, of course, to feed the nation’s enormous appetite for primary steel. Normally, however, the ore comes from Australia (64pc) or Brazil (the other major supplier at 22pc).\n\nThe Winning Youth’s cargo was different. It was the first to be shipped from the enormous Simandou deposits in Guinea, West Africa. The ship departed from the Conakry anchorage on Dec 2.\n\nThe Simandou mines, the associated rail line to the coast, and the specially built barge port on the Morébaya river estuary from which the ore is loaded aboard ships in the anchorage, are a massive joint project.\n\nThis has complex finances, but according to analysis house Drewry: “Chinese entities collectively have the largest strategic influence across the entire project through both mine ownership and shared control of the rail-port infrastructure. China is the largest combined strategic stakeholder.”\n\nThe Simandou project is not yet properly online: it took three weeks to get the Winning Youth fully loaded, much longer than it will take to load a bulker once the railway and the barge terminal are up to full capacity. (The mine isn’t really a bottleneck: it’s more a matter of simply scooping ore up and putting it in railway cars rather than mining as generally understood.)\n\nBut Simandou is expected to ramp up fast over the next few years, perhaps shipping 120 million tons annually in the near term. It’s also expected that most – if not all – of that ore will go to China.\n\nThat matters, because Australian control over the bulk of China’s iron ore supply is often thought to be one of the factors holding Xi Jinping back from an active military campaign to conquer Taiwan. Australia would surely cease shipments of ore in response to such a campaign, and the damage to China’s enormous industries would be colossal.\n\nHowever, not many years from now, this would have much less effect as massive amounts of ore would still be shipping from Simandou. As the shape of the world’s cargo routes changes, so too will the calculus of power in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nConfrontation in the strait is in fact already under way, with Chinese military manoeuvres there now so menacing that the “Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis” is deemed to have been going on since 2022.\n\nThis is the background to Sir Keir’s visit to Beijing this week. Accompanied by British business leaders, his trip is reportedly aimed at restoring the “golden era” of Sino-British trade and investment seen under Theresa May.\n\nThe Starmer Government’s eagerness to woo China was apparent in its decision days ago to allow the new Chinese “super embassy” in London to go ahead – a decision described in The Telegraph by former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith as “a humiliating sell-out”.\n\nBritish messaging is mixed, however. Last week the nuclear-powered attack submarine HMS Anson arrived at Gibraltar. Gibraltar is the submarine’s first stop on her way to Australia, where she will probably spend at least six months based out of Perth as part of Submarine Rotational Force West.\n\nSRF-West is the first stage of the Australia-UK-US “Aukus” agreement, which will evolve into a tri-national force of nuclear attack boats based at Perth, and the infrastructure in Australia and the UK which will build and support them.\n\nSince Anson is probably the only serviceable attack submarine in the Royal Navy at the moment, and with the Russian threat in the Atlantic ever more present, it is clear that the Government is placing a very high priority indeed on Aukus.\n\nThe whole point of Aukus, of course, is to confront China’s growing power in the Pacific.\n\nMainland China refuses to have diplomatic relations with any nation which recognises Taiwan as independent.\n\nDiplomats, at least, believe that diplomatic relations with China are essential – although in the case of the UK the result appears to be a large piece of Chinese territory in central London occupied by a massive CCP spy fortress. Only a few small nations recognise Taiwan as independent, probably the best known being the Vatican.\n\nQuite a lot of nations, however, take an “ambiguous” stance towards Taiwanese independence. They have diplomatic relations with China, embassies and all, and they do not formally recognise Taiwan’s nationhood.\n\nThey do not have embassies in Taipei and Taiwan does not have embassies in their capitals, but there are people and buildings that do much the same thing.\n\nThe UK, for instance, has the British Office in Taipei, staffed by Foreign Office employees who would be diplomats if they were accredited as such.\n\nTaiwan has a similar “Taipei Representative Office” in Belgravia. There is a parking space across the street with “diplomats” painted on it, for all that the representatives in the office are – officially – not diplomats, which somewhat gives away the British Government’s real stance.\n\nRather more importantly, the entire US policy towards Taiwan has always been one of “strategic ambiguity”. What this has actually tended to mean, however, is fairly firm and evident American backing for Taiwanese independence and democracy.\n\nDuring the run up to the 1996 election in Taiwan, for instance, China made a serious attempt to frighten the Taiwanese into voting for the pro-Beijing candidate. More than 100,000 troops were mustered on the mainland side of the strait and amphibious invasion exercises took place.\n\nChina also fired ballistic missiles into Taiwanese territorial waters, causing enough upset that merchant shipping ceased using the strait twice and maritime insurance rates for Taiwan increased significantly.\n\nThis sabre-rattling, however, was largely negated by the arrival of two US aircraft carrier groups and other naval elements.\n\nThat confrontation is nowadays known as the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis (the first two, in the 1950s, involved artillery bombardments from the mainland against outlying Taiwan-controlled islands).\n\nChinese air and naval power was fairly negligible in the mid-1990s, a fact that was illustrated by the carrier USS Nimitz twice cruising through the strait along with various other US warships. The pro-Beijing candidate in Taiwan got less than 15pc of the vote.\n\nEver since then, the US military has assumed that a fight against China would be likely, with its traditional Cold War foe Russia relegated to second place.\n\nThis makes sense: the Chinese economy is now no less than 20 times the size it was in the mid-1990s and the CCP’s defence budget is the second biggest in the world, much bigger than that of Russia even with Vladimir Putin’s new war economy.\n\nNeedless to say, Chinese air and naval power are no longer negligible. Indeed, by count of warships the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is actually bigger than the US Navy, though America for the moment still has a considerable advantage in terms of overall tonnage and missile launch tubes – probably more important numbers.\n\nMeanwhile the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) now has hundreds of fifth-generation stealth fighters and more than 100 long-range strategic bombers able to mount devastating missile strikes against enemy fleets and bases far away.\n\nProbably more significantly still, the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) – this is a separate arm of service in China – does not only have intercontinental nuclear missiles.\n\nIt also has more than 3,000 shorter-ranging ballistic, hypersonic and cruise missiles able to strike targets with conventional warheads at great distances. In particular, US bases in Guam, Japan and South Korea are threatened, and if US warships in the region can be located and tracked, they can potentially be sunk.\n\nThe US military ought nonetheless to be enormously more powerful than China’s. US nominal GDP is still half again that of China, and crucially the US spends proportionally more on defence, or as the new administration prefers to put it, on “war”: 3.4pc to China’s 1.7pc. America’s colossal military spending, approaching $1tn a year, is roughly triple that of China.\n\nBut that isn’t the whole picture. Both China and the US mostly make their own armaments and recruit from their own labour markets: and the cost of Chinese-made weapons, planes, ships, etc, is much lower than US-made ones. Chinese soldiers, sailors and airmen are much cheaper than Americans.\n\nThis cost difference is illustrated by the fact that China’s vast shipbuilding industry, far and away the biggest in the world, built warships of a combined tonnage equal to the entire Royal Navy in just the four years up to 2025 and this rate is accelerating. American shipyards, so expensive that they can mostly win business only from the Pentagon, are struggling even to replace existing US warships as they wear out – let alone expand the fleet.\n\nComparisons like this explain the fact that on a purchasing-power parity basis, as opposed to nominal GDP, the Chinese economy is actually a third again bigger than the US.\n\nThis suggests that in terms of buying and hiring power the American war department only enjoys a 50pc advantage, rather than a three-fold one.\n\nThen there is the fact that a battle in the vicinity of Taiwan would see US forces operating at long range from their bases and the Chinese close to theirs.\n\nIn the scenario of an amphibious invasion by China, a US Navy attack submarine – or perhaps an allied Aukus one, HMS Anson or one of her successors – might well slip past or fight through relatively unpracticed PLAN anti-submarine forces and into the Taiwan Strait.\n\nParts of the strait are too shallow for a nuclear attack boat, but this would still be a fox-in-the-henhouse event for the invasion fleet: the sub’s torpedoes and missiles would take a fearful toll of the Chinese amphibious forces. The submarine might well survive to escape once it was out of weapons.\n\nBut if such a submarine were part of the Aukus force at Perth, it would then have a journey of 4,000 miles back to base to re-arm itself, and then another equally long voyage to get back into the fight.\n\nThe sub captain might head instead for a closer US base such as Guam, but this would still be nearly 2,000 miles away. The boat might then arrive only to find the base knocked out, or might be sunk at the jetty by long-ranging Chinese strikes.\n\nMeanwhile, a Chinese warship near Taiwan would be only briefly absent if it needed to resupply, meaning that each Chinese ship would deliver a lot more combat power than an equivalent US or allied one. The US president might choose to strike Chinese bases on the mainland, of course, but it is definitely possible that this would be viewed as overly escalatory – an ever-present consideration in a war where both sides have intercontinental nukes.\n\nAll these factors tend to erode the American spending advantage. It was not a total surprise when a Pentagon summary – the so-called “Overmatch Brief” – leaked last month.\n\nIt was based on years of US wargaming, classified intelligence briefings and simulations, and it stated categorically that America would “most likely suffer decisive defeat” if it attempted to intervene against any attempt by China to conquer Taiwan.\n\nOne reason that the Overmatch Brief is not surprising, of course, is that the Pentagon has every incentive to suggest that it needs more resources. Similarly the fact that it leaked to the media was not a shock – if nobody knows that such a document exists, it has much less effect. The Overmatch Brief may one day be compared to the “missile gap” and “bomber gap” ideas put forth by the US Air Force in the 1950s, claiming that the Soviet Union’s forces were hugely stronger than they actually were in an attempt to obtain a bigger budget.\n\nFactors of budget relative to scenario, indeed, have powerful effects on all militaries. For instance it seems clear that the first and quite probably decisive stages of any China-Taiwan-US shooting war would be an air and sea contest mostly involving long-range missiles. On the US side the missiles would mostly be launched from ships or aircraft.\n\nThis is a pleasing thought for the US Navy and the US Air Force. It is not at all pleasing for the US Army and Marine Corps, who would not wish to be left out.\n\nThis has led to the curious spectacle of the Marines converting many of their conventional combat units into so-called “Littoral Regiments” and the Army similarly creating what it calls “Multi Domain Task Forces”. Both of these are basically land-based missile units, a sort of American PLARF. The problem is that America would probably not wish to provoke China in advance, so they cannot be based on Taiwan and thus would probably not be all that much use.\n\nThese matters aside, the big question for Xi, Trump and the various China hawks in his team – undersecretary of defence for policy Elbridge Colby, for instance – is this: what would happen if China moved against Taiwan and the US intervened?\n\nThe usual way to find an answer to this sort of question is wargames – the military version of what is called “modelling”, if one is talking about subjects such as pandemic disease or climate change. There have been many wargames around the idea of a Chinese invasion or blockade of Taiwan.\n\nMost of them have taken place behind the curtain of classified information, as with the Overmatch Brief. Such models may benefit from better or more detailed data. What is almost always true is that secret modelling is even more likely to be driven by an underlying agenda than openly visible work.\n\nThat’s why it’s probably useful for most of us to look at public wargame modelling of a possible fight for Taiwan. An influential Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), has made a strong effort here.\n\nThe CSIS wargames acknowledge some uncomfortable realities for the US forces.\n\nAmerican cruisers and destroyers, for instance, have truly amazing defences against incoming Chinese missiles of various kinds, and such defences can mean that even a major Chinese strike can be resisted by a US aircraft carrier strike group or another kind of US Navy surface taskforce.\n\nBut the numbers are remorseless. In one example, China sends out a force of 24 H-6 heavy bombers armed with four YJ-12 ship-killer missiles each. The bombers can range far out into the Pacific, sweeping large stretches of ocean with their radar. If they have any vague idea where a US Navy task force may be, they can locate it.\n\nIf the US force includes a carrier, its radar plane is likely to detect the Chinese bombers long before they can find the carrier, and in that case the carrier’s fighters are likely to solve the problem.\n\nThe CSIS model doesn’t acknowledge the reality that a strike package of H-6s would be unlikely to get past responding US Navy fighters, especially if they were armed with the new beyond-visual-range air-launched SM-6.\n\nThe bombers would probably all have been shot out of the sky before they ever got a sniff of the carrier, which would remain below their radar horizon.\n\nBut if there are no US radar planes or fighters in play, the hail of missiles from the Chinese bombers is likely to overwhelm even the extremely strong Aegis/Standard defence of US cruisers and destroyers, sinking most if not all of them.\n\nIf the US ships do beat off such an attack, the Chinese bombers fly home, re-arm and return in a matter of hours. The American ships’ missile tubes will be largely empty this time, and this is before the extra firepower of the far-away land-based PLARF batteries comes into play.\n\nThe CSIS wargames still do not predict the clear-cut defeat seen in the Overmatch Brief. Indeed, their results suggest that in fact if the US is committed to the fight and doesn’t hesitate at the start, it can knock China back with a very bloody nose in the event of any serious fight over Taiwan.\n\nThe end result would be a Taiwan Strait filled with burning and sinking Chinese wrecks and the survivors of the Chinese invasion force trapped on Taiwan with their supply lines from the mainland cut, eventually forced to surrender.\n\nBut the US Navy and Air Force would have suffered on a scale not seen since the Second World War. Hundreds of American fighter jets would have been destroyed, mostly wrecked on the ground in their bases in Japan and elsewhere by long-ranging Chinese strikes.\n\nThe US Navy and its allies would lose dozens of ships and thousands of sailors. HMS Anson or her future successor on SRF-West would probably have done a huge amount of damage to the PLAN and its amphibious fleet, knowing our submariners, but they would in all likelihood have gone down fighting in the end, assuming they could rearm and get back in the battle often enough.\n\nBoth China and the US would be seriously damaged as global military powers, and Taiwan would still be free but shattered as a nation and an economy – and that would mean knock-on damage to all world economies, given how vital the Taiwanese semiconductor industry is to us all.\n\nThe lesson of history for us all to take away – not only the US, but Australia, Britain and everyone else in the West – is that ancient and well-tried truism: if you would have peace, prepare yourself for war.\n\nThe way to persuade Xi Jinping not to invade Taiwan is to make the chance of failure higher.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "‘Legally carrying a firearm is not the same as brandishing a firearm,’ the former Georgia congresswoman wrote",
    "fullText": "Marjorie Taylor Greene has urged fellow MAGA supporters – and other Americans – to “take off their political blinders” over the death of protester Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, warning that they are being “incited into civil war.”\n\n“I unapologetically believe in border security and deporting criminal illegal aliens and I support law enforcement,” Greene wrote on X Sunday, the day after the fatal shooting. “However, I also unapologetically support the 2nd amendment.\n\n“Legally carrying a firearm is not the same as brandishing a firearm.”\n\nDespite video showing that 37-year-old Pretti was filming federal officers but did not have a weapon drawn, the Trump administration has claimed he had tried to assassinate agents in an act of “domestic terrorism.”\n\nThe incident was captured from multiple angles, including one that showed Pretti being sprayed with mace and wrestled to the ground while attempting to help a woman who had just been sprayed herself and had fallen to the ground. After being swarmed by around seven officers a shot rings out, followed by at least nine more, and Pretti falls still.\n\n“There is nothing wrong with legally peacefully protesting and videoing,” Greene said.\n\nThe former Congresswoman asked MAGA to consider another scenario in which she replaced the protesters in Minnesota with those who supported the action on January 6, when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol.\n\n“We lost our minds when we watched Biden’s FBI track down and aggressively carry out home invasions and arrest… peaceful J6’ers who walked in the Capitol through open doors,” she said.\n\n“Imaging [sic] if one of our MAGA independent journalists or even just a MAGA supporter stood in the street outside a J6’ers house while Biden’s FBI carried out a law enforcement operation, home invasion, and arrest.\n\n“Then Biden’s FBI goes to the MAGA guy videoing it all and shoves a woman with him to the ground and sprays them with bear spray then throws the MAGA guy to the ground as MAGA guy was trying to help the woman off the ground. Then Biden’s FBI beats MAGA guy on the ground, disarms MAGA guy, and then shoots him dead.\n\n“What would have been our reaction? Both sides need to take off their political blinders. You are all being incited into civil war, yet none of it solves any of the real problems that we all face, and tragically people are dying.”\n\nPretti’s death is the second fatal shooting to involve federal agents in Minneapolis in less than three weeks, following the killing of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good on January 7. Tensions and clashes between demonstrators have increased, as well as those between state and federal authorities.\n\nMinneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said earlier Sunday that residents, as well as his own police department have “had enough.”\n\n“This police department has only 600 police officers. We are stretched incredibly thin. This has taken an enormous toll trying to manage all of this chaos on top of trying to be the police department for a major city,” O’Hara told CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday.\n\nO’Hara noted that he has received no official information from the federal government related to Saturday’s shooting. “Even when our officers initially responded to the scene, our watch commander was not given even the most basic information that is typical in a law enforcement-involved shooting,” he said.\n\nWhile the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension was blocked from the scene of the shooting Saturday by federal officials, they were allowed access Sunday to canvas for witnesses.\n\nGreene’s comments represent the latest instance of her breaking from MAGA orthodoxy. Previously a firebrand Trump loyalist, she has publicly broken from the president in recent months over issues including the Epstein files and foreign policy. She stood down from Congress earlier this month.",

    "fullText": "UFC 324 results, highlights: Justin Gaethje wins interim gold following brutal war against game Paddy Pimblett originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFor years, the UFC promoted Paddy Pimblett as the next big thing. His rise to the top was meant to result in the Liverpool-born fighter holding gold.\n\nHowever, in his path at UFC 324 was a dangerous Justin Gaethje, who brutalized “The Baddy” for five rounds to once again win interim lightweight gold.\n\nThe UFC’s first show on Paramount+ began with a retrospective on the promotion's history, honoring those who laid the foundations for what it is today. UFC 324 showcased the future, with fighters using their skills to deliver highlight-reel wins.\n\nIt also helped that the UFC recently upped the ante with performance bonuses ($25k for KOs), as the first four bouts ended via knockout. The theme of the night transitioned smoothly to the main event.\n\nGaethje (27-5) came into the fight looking to retire as champion by 2027. He started guns blazing and didn’t slow down. “The Highlight” landed several uppercuts and jabs that cut the face of Pimblett (23–4), participating in the toughest fight of his career.\n\nThe eyes of Pimblett got poked at one point. He attempted to use elbows to hurt Gaethje. At certain points, they were efficient. Gaethje’s strikes, which dropped Pimblett, were just too much.\n\nPIMBLETT IN A WORLD OF TROUBLE EARLY\n\n📺 @paramountpluspic.twitter.com/ooBFDwjofz\n\n— Paramount UFC (@paramountufc) January 25, 2026\n\nPimblett had a second wind and proved his toughness against the toughest opponent of his career. He chopped Gaethje's legs in an attempt to keep him off balance. Pimblett even landed sharp uppercuts.\n\nGaethje, known for having a tough chin and attacking when smelling blood, was on another level.\n\nGaethje landed 178 significant strikes while Pimblett landed 169. The former landed 219 total strikes. The loss ended Pimblett's nine-fight win streak. Gaethje has now won two straight.\n\n\"That Scouser does NOT get knocked out.\" - Justin Gaethje\n\n📺 @paramountpluspic.twitter.com/LvqwmMGxqQ\n\n— Paramount UFC (@paramountufc) January 25, 2026\n\nUp next for Gaethje? It all depends on the status of champion Ilia Topuria, who is dealing with a personal matter. The interim champion could also fight Arman Tsarukyan, the top contender within the division.\n\nSean O’Malley may have secured a title shot on the White House card after beating Song Yadong in the co-main event. O’Malley (19-3, 1 NC) battled against Yadong (22-9, 1 NC), the latter landing leg kicks that hurt. “Suga” won round one and did enough in round three to get the win.\n\nO’Malley called out Petr Yan for the UFC bantamweight title, likely on the White House card. He understood if former champion Merab Dvalishvili got a third fight with Yan, but it appears likely the UFC will book O’Malley against the champion.\n\nWaldo Cortes-Acosta took it to Derrick Lewis, hurting the big man following vicious shots on the floor.\n\nRanked fifth at heavyweight, the Dominican used jabs and kicks to slow Lewis (29-13, 1 NC) down. Following a slip by Lewis, Cortes-Acosta (17-2) took advantage to get his third straight win.\n\nMORE: All you need to know about the UFC's partnership with Paramount+\n\nNatalia Silva earned a win against a former champion for the third straight time when she beat Rose Namajunas. Silva (20-5-1), replacing Alexa Grasso, was tentative to start the fight. The first round could have gone to anyone, but all three judges favored Silva.\n\nAs time went on, Silva looked confident. She took Namajunas (14-8) down late in the third, and it was enough to secure a win. With 13 straight wins, Silva may be next for flyweight champion Valentina Shevchenko.\n\nArnold Allen and Jean Silva are known for their striking. They did so for three rounds, landing everything from leg kicks to uppercuts. Allen (20-4) used jabs to bloody Silva (17-3), while the latter used elbows and kicks to affect the spirit of Allen.\n\nSilva is back to his winning ways as a member of The Fighting Nerds.\n\nThe Sporting News provided results, analysis, and highlights from UFC 324.\n\nGaethje won via unanimous decision.\n\nRound five: Gaethje with several big shots. he missed and Pimblett took advantage.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump gives. And he takes away.\n\nOffended by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's increasingly assertive posture toward the U.S., Trump revoked an invitation to join his Board of Peace. Many Western allies are suspicious of the organization, which is chaired by Trump and was initially formed to focus on maintaining the ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas but has grown into something skeptics fear could rival the United Nations.\n\nAppearing at the World Economic Forum, Trump spoke of imposing tariffs on Switzerland — which he ultimately lowered — because the country's leader “rubbed me the wrong way” during a phone call. Before shelving sweeping tariffs on multiple European countries, Trump pressed Denmark to “say yes” to the U.S. push to control Greenland “and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no and we will remember,” he said, imperiling the NATO alliance.\n\nOver his decades in public life, Trump has never been one for niceties. But even by his standards, the tumult of the past week stood out because it crystallized his determination to erase the rules-based order that has governed U.S. foreign policy — and by extension most of the Western world — since World War II.\n\nThe president and his supporters have dismissed that approach as inefficient, overly focused on compromise and unresponsive to the needs of people contending with rapid economic change. But in its place, Trump is advancing a system that is poorly understood and could prove far less stable, driven by the whims of a single, often mercurial, leader who regularly demonstrates that personal flattery or animus can shape his decisions.\n\nReturning to the U.S. from Davos, home to the World Economic Forum, Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said the phrase she heard “over and over” was that “we are entering this new world order” as she described a sense of confusion among allies.\n\n“It may be you just had a bad telephone call with the president and now you're going to have tariffs directed at you,” she told reporters. “This lack of stability and reliability, I think, is causing what were traditionally reliable trade partners to be saying to other countries, ‘Hey, maybe you and I should talk because I’m not sure about what’s going on with the United States.’”\n\nThe Trump-centric approach to governing\n\nThe Trump-centric approach to governing is hardly surprising for someone who accepted his first Republican presidential nomination in 2016 by declaring that “I alone can fix” the nation's problems. As he settles into his second term with a far more confident demeanor than his first, he has delighted supporters with his to-the-victor -goes-the-spoils style.\n\nSteve Bannon, Trump's former adviser, recently told the Atlantic that Trump is pursuing a “maximalist strategy” and that he must keep going “until you meet resistance.”\n\n“And we haven’t met any resistance,” Bannon said.\n\nThat's certainly true in Washington, where the Republican-controlled Congress has done little to check Trump's impulses. But leaders of other countries, who have spent much of Trump's administration trying to find ways to work with him, are increasingly vocal.\n\nCarney is quickly emerging as a leader of a movement for countries to find ways to link up and counter the U.S. Speaking in Davos ahead of Trump, Carney said, “Middle powers must act together because if you are not at the table, you are on the menu.”\n\n“In a world of great power rivalry, the countries in between have a choice: to compete with each other for favor or to combine to create a third path with impact,” he continued. “We should not allow the rise of hard powers to blind us to the fact that the power of legitimacy, integrity, and rules will remain strong — if we choose to wield it together.”\n\nTrump did not take kindly to those remarks, responding with threats in Davos before yanking the Board of Peace invitation.\n\n“Canada lives because of the United States,” Trump said. “Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.”\n\nCarney, however, was unbowed, speaking of Canada as “an example to a world at sea” as he crafted a potential template for other world leaders navigating a new era.\n\n“We can show that another way is possible, that the arc of history isn’t destined to be warped toward authoritarianism and exclusion,” he said in a speech before a cabinet retreat in Quebec City.\n\nIn the UK, Prime Minister Keir Starmer blasted Trump on Friday for “insulting and frankly appalling” comments in which he expressed doubt that NATO would support the U.S. if requested. The president seemingly ignored that the only time Article 5 of NATO’s founding treaty, which requires all member countries to help another member under threat, was invoked was after the 9/11 attacks on the U.S.\n\nReferring to non-US troops, Trump told Fox Business Network, “You know, they’ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that, and they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.”\n\nStarmer, noting the 457 British personnel who died and those with life-long injuries, said he will “never forget their courage, their bravery and the sacrifice they made for their country.” Denmark, which Trump has belittled as “ungrateful” for U.S. protection during World War II, had the highest per capita death toll among coalition forces in Afghanistan.\n\nHis tactics have raised fears that Trump is imposing long-term damage on the U.S. standing in the world and encouraging countries to rethink their alliances and deepen their ties with China. Carney already traveled there earlier this month to meet with President Xi Jinping.\n\n“China’s leadership watched an American president fight with allies, insult world leaders, and engage in bizarre antics, and thought to themselves — this is nothing but good for us,” Jake Sullivan, former President Joe Biden's national security adviser, said in an email.\n\nThe administration is showing no sign of backing down. In a social media post referring to Canada's ties with Beijing, Trump said China “will eat them up.” And the Pentagon released a defense strategy late Friday telling allies to handle their own security.\n\nSen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, was in Davos and participated in a bipartisan delegation to Denmark with Murkowski that was intended to show unity amid Trump's bid for Greenland. Recalling his conversations with other leaders, he told reporters on Friday that Trump has shown he only backs down when countries like China “showed toughness and a resiliency.”\n\n“Those who were accommodating and who negotiated in good faith, like the EU, which did not impose retaliatory tariffs, seemed to have not won any of his respect,” Coons said. “They can reach their own conclusions, but it would seem to me that trying to find a way to accommodate him when the foundation of his demands about Greenland is unhinged … seem to me to suggest a course of action.”",

    "fullText": "My colleague Ben Bergman rubbed shoulders with world leaders, tech gurus, and venture capitalists in Davos this week.\n\nThere's nothing better than being in the room where it happens. I asked Ben what he saw and heard. Here are his highlights:\n\nQ: What was the biggest tech thing that was talked about at Davos this year?\n\nIt's hard to compete with President Trump and Greenland, but aside from that, AI was what everyone was talking about.\n\nThere was a lot of discussion about when businesses will start to see productivity gains that justify their huge AI spend and whether we are in a bubble.\n\nQ: What tech discussion/theme surprised you at Davos?\n\nWalking down the main thoroughfare in Davos is always a highlight because all the shops that are open the rest of the year are taken over this week by companies that host \"houses\" to showcase their brands and host clients and events.\n\nIt is interesting to see who's here and who's not.\n\nDavos is not a tech conference, and I've usually thought of it as being more dominated by finance and blue-chip companies.\n\nWalking along the street this year, 80% of the houses were tech. Palantir and Meta (with its free hot chocolate stand) had the most visible presence. Amazon's house was surprisingly small. Google was far away from the main action. Lightspeed was the only venture capital firm I saw, with its odd retro \"Lighthouse.\"\n\nIt is also interesting to see who was not here. OpenAI has no house, and Sam Altman did not come, though some executives are here. Elon Musk was not originally part of the program but was a last-minute addition on Thursday.\n\nQ: What was the tone of the tech executives and tech investors there?\n\nIf executives and investors are worried about the future, they did not share that with me or on stage.\n\nNvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang described what is happening with AI as \"the largest infrastructure buildout in human history,\" and not only that, but said it will drive job creation across the global economy.\n\nQ: What was the biggest concern expressed by tech executives and tech investors at Davos this year?\n\nWhile optimism ruled the week, the fear of being in an AI bubble was on everyone's mind.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella warned onstage Tuesday that there would be a bubble if the only companies using AI are other AI companies.\n\n\"For this not to be a bubble by definition, it requires that the benefits of this are much more evenly spread,\" Nadella said.\n\nHuang cited the rising rental price of computer chips as evidence that we are not in a bubble.\n\n\"If you try to rent an Nvidia GPU these days, it's so incredibly hard, and the spot price of GPU rentals is going up, not just the latest generation, but two-generation-old GPUs,\" he said.\n\nAnother concern from tech executives I spoke to was how hard it is to hire and retain top talent right now, especially as big AI labs spend like drunken sailors to hire.\n\n\"It's astronomical amounts of money at the big level,\" Winston Weinberg, CEO and co-founder of Harvey, told me. He said he spends 70% of his time on hiring.\n\n\"I'm super involved, and I think it's the most important thing at our company right now, Weinberg said.\n\nQ: Anything else tech folks should know from your time there?\n\nThere were so many techies here that sometimes I felt like I was in San Francisco.\n\nI asked a couple of startup founders why they came so far to be here, and the consensus was that there's nothing like Davos for the efficiency of meeting potential customers and investors who are all packed into a tiny Swiss village for the week.\n\nWaiting in the cold in a long line for a party for General Catalyst and Lightspeed, I asked one founder why he traveled here.\n\nHe told me Alexandr Wang, founder and former CEO of Scale AI, who is now chief AI officer at Meta, advised him Davos was highly useful because Wang last year said he signed almost a third of Scale's customers in the short time he was here.\n\nWeinberg told me that dealmaking started even before I arrived, with many transactions happening in the business-class sections of flights to Zurich from San Francisco and New York.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli forces on Tuesday targeted at least two United Nations facilities, pushing forward with a crackdown against the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees tasked with delivering humanitarian services to millions of people across the region.\n\nCrews began bulldozing the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ’s offices in Sheikh Jarrah and fired tear gas at a vocational school in Qalandia, marking Israel’s latest and most dramatic step against UNRWA.\n\nIsrael has long railed against the agency, accusing it of being infiltrated by Hamas and saying that some of its employees were involved in the October 2023 attack that triggered Israel’s two-year war in Gaza. UNRWA leaders have said they took swift action against the employees accused of taking part in the attack, and have denied allegations that the agency tolerates or collaborates with Hamas.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday condemned Israel’s destruction of the agency's compound and called for it to be returned to the U.N.'s control.\n\n“The Secretary-General views as wholly unacceptable the continued escalatory actions against UNRWA, which are inconsistent with Israel’s clear obligations under international law,\" said Farhan Haq, the deputy U.N. spokesperson.\n\nRoland Friedrich, the agency's West Bank director, said UNRWA received word that demolition crews and police arrived at their east Jerusalem headquarters early on Tuesday. Staff have not operated out of the facility for almost a year out of safety concerns, but Israeli forces confiscated devices and forced out private security guards protecting the facility.\n\n“What we saw today is the culmination of two years of incitement and measures against UNRWA in east Jerusalem,” Friedrich said.\n\nHe said forces also began firing tear gas outside the vocational school on the outskirts of Jerusalem on Tuesday afternoon before ultimately leaving. More than 300 young refugees receive job training in technology and welding there.\n\nSome children on their way home from the school were overcome by the tear gas and a 15-year-old was hit in the eye with a rubber bullet, according to the Palestinian Authority’s Jerusalem governorate, which monitors Palestinian affairs in the area.\n\nIsraeli leaders celebrate demolition\n\nIsrael’s Foreign Ministry said the demolition enforced a new law banning UNRWA, noting that Israel owns the site and rejecting UNRWA’s claims that the move violated international law.\n\nIsrael has long claimed the agency has an anti-Israel bias. Often with little evidence, it says UNRWA employs and maintains ties with militant groups including Hamas. The U.N. has ardently denied such claims and UNRWA has said it acts quickly to purge any suspected militants among its staff.\n\nUNRWA's mandate is to provide aid and services to some 2.5 million Palestinian refugees in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem, as well as 3 million more refugees in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. The group has for years maintained infrastructure in refugee camps and also run schools and provided health care. But its operations were curtailed last year when Israel’s Knesset passed legislation severing ties and banning it from functioning in what it defines as Israel — including east Jerusalem.\n\nThe agency said the demolitions could imperil operations at the vocational center in Qalandia and heath facility in Shu'afat, where it still provides education and health services.\n\nAn Israeli flag was seen hoisted above the facility in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, where some Israeli politicians arrived on the scene to celebrate the organization's fate. National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir called it “a historic day.”\n\nThe demolition marked the culmination of years of criticism from Israel and its leaders. Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war more than two years ago, it has ramped up such attacks, saying the militants used UNRWA facilities and seized aid. It has provided little evidence for the claims, which the U.N. has denied. The International Court of Justice said in October that Israel must allow the agency to provide humanitarian assistance in Gaza.\n\nSince Israel passed its law banning the agency last year, its facilities — schools and health centers — and its headquarters have repeatedly been closed, raided or left unprotected.\n\n“This must be a wake-up call,\" Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA's commissioner-general, said in a statement on X. “What happens today to UNRWA will happen tomorrow to any other international organisation or diplomatic mission, whether in the Occupied Palestinian Territory or anywhere around the world.”\n\nMore aid groups in Gaza face pressure\n\nIsrael's ban on UNRWA dovetailed with broader efforts to deregister aid groups operating in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Israel has passed laws requiring nongovernmental organizations not to hire staff involved in activities that “delegitimize Israel” or support boycotts, demanding they register lists of names as a condition of being allowed to work.\n\nIsrael told dozens of groups — including Doctors Without Borders and CARE — that their licenses would expire at the end of 2025. The organizations say the rules are arbitrary and warned that the new ban would harm people desperately in need of humanitarian aid.\n\nSettler violence in the West Bank rose last year\n\nThe Israeli military said Tuesday that attacks carried out by Jewish settlers against Palestinians and Israeli security forces in the West Bank increased by 27% last year compared with 2024.\n\nThere were 867 reports of “nationalistic crimes” — with the number of severe incidents up by more than 50%, according to internal statistics from the Israeli military and the country’s Shin Bet domestic security service.\n\nMounting settler violence in the West Bank has emptied villages since the war between Israel and Hamas erupted, according to B’Tselem, an Israeli rights group helping the residents.\n\nThe Israeli military has carried out large-scale operations in the West Bank targeting militants that have killed hundreds of Palestinians. There also has been a rise in Palestinian attacks on Israelis.\n\nIsraeli authorities have a mixed relationship with settlers, at times dismantling unauthorized outposts while also deploying forces to protect them from Palestinians.\n\nJulia Frankel and Shlomo Mor in Jerusalem and Edith M.

The word \"bear\" was one of Japan's words of the year in 2025.\n\nThe release, citing figures from Japan's environment ministry, said bear sightings increased 163% between 2021 and 2025, and there had been 100 bear attack-linked injuries and 12 deaths in Japan since April.\n\nJapan deployed troops from the Self-Defense Forces — the country's key military branch — in December to its northern regions, where several bear sightings had been reported. The troops set box traps to capture the bears.\n\nThe drones can be controlled from about half a mile away, and can spray the bears with \"pinpoint accuracy,\" the release said. Bear sprays contain capsaicin, a chemical found in chili peppers, which irritates the bear's eyes and nose, giving the human time to escape.\n\nIt added, \"This provides a highly effective method of scaring away bears, whose sense of smell is thousands of times stronger than that of humans, and allows them time to temporarily evacuate.\"\n\nThe bear-spray drones are not the only drone-based solution Japan has deployed thus far.\n\nIn November, Gifu Prefecture deployed barking drones that mimic the sounds of hunting dogs, along with firecrackers, to scare off incoming bears. The drones featured large googly eyes and loudspeakers.",

    "fullText": "PC; Inkle\nThe UK game developer’s latest is a database mystery constructed from an archive of fictional books. Their combined contents threaten to crack the code of reality\n\nBletchley Park: famed home of the Enigma machine, Colossus computer, and, according to the premise of TR-49, an altogether stranger piece of tech. Two engineers created a machine that feeds on the most esoteric books: treatises on quantum computing, meditations on dark matter, pulp sci-fi novels and more. In the mid-2010s, when the game is set, Britain finds itself again engulfed by war, this time with itself. The arcane tool may hold the key to victory.\n\nYou play as budding codebreaker Abbi, a straight-talking northerner who is sifting through the machine now moved to a crypt beneath Manchester Cathedral. She has no idea how it works and neither do you. So you start tinkering. You input a four-digit code – two letters followed by two numbers. What do these correspond to? The initials of people and the year of a particular book’s publication. Input a code correctly and you are whisked away to the corresponding page, as if using a particularly speedy microfiche reader. These pages – say, by famed fictional physicist, Joshua Silverton – are filled with clues and, should you get lucky, further codes and even the titles of particular works. Your primary goal is to match codes with the corresponding book title in a bid to find the most crucial text of all, Endpeace, the key to understanding the erudite ghosts of this machine.\n\nHidden within this rhizomatic network of information is a mystery so intriguing and elegant that it can unfold naturally from any individual player’s investigations – no matter which titles or authors you see first, or where your particular curiosities lead you thereafter. Connections can cascade, tumbling like a waterfall, before swerving in unexpected directions, defying the traditionally linear logic of mystery fiction. TR-49 gives you an in-game notepad to keep track of everything; I recommend also keeping an actual pen and paper beside you.\n\nYou might imagine TR-49 as a comment on the rise of AI large language models (LLMs) which “scrape” data as this game’s machine feeds on writing. Actually, its concerns are broader and more ambitious, recalling the heady recent books of Chilean author Benjamín Labatut (When We Cease to Understand the World and The Maniac). Like Labatut, TR-49 brims with awe, scepticism and horror at the reality-shredding possibilities of scientific and technological advances made in the 20th century, all while pushing these concepts into a playful, fantastical space.\n\nLess compelling are conversations that play out between Abbi and her companions on the other end of a radio transmission. Where the mystery told through the machine itself is lavishly detailed, what happens outside it feels too thin: Abbi’s reasons for being there; the nature of the conflict raging above, which is sketched in frustratingly vague terms.\n\nStill, the interactive heart of TR-49 resides in trawling this codebreaking device for secrets. And in this regard, the game is an unqualified success; TR-49’s database mystery rivals Sam Barlow’s games Her Story and Immortality, though it is of an unashamedly literary nature compared to those more filmic works.\n\nCloser to TR-49’s beginning, you may feel crushed by this mass of inscrutable writings. Quickly, you will swim elegantly amid it, conversant in its many, many peculiarities. Across a handful of evenings, I relished disappearing into this archive, cavorting from log to log, title to title, following threads and losing track of time. Each scrap of paper, water-damaged periodical and rare first edition threatened to solve this mystery, yet none could in isolation. Just as the fictional maker of the archive fell under the spell of these records and materials, I too was seduced.",

    "description": "A new report warns the U.S. could lose the ability to sustain combat within weeks of a China war over Taiwan, as munitions run dry, logistics collapse and global markets face a $10T shock.",
    "fullText": "FIRST ON FOX: The Trump administration asked for redactions to a sweeping new Heritage Foundation report modeling a potential U.S.–China war over Taiwan, even though the analysis relied entirely on publicly available, unclassified data, according to the report’s authors.\n\nThe redacted report, TIDALWAVE, warns that the United States could reach a breaking point within weeks of a high‑intensity conflict with China — conclusions that the authors say prompted senior national security officials to seek redactions over concerns adversaries could exploit the findings or use them to identify U.S. and allied military vulnerabilities.\n\nThose conclusions include warnings that U.S. forces would culminate far sooner than China, suffer catastrophic losses to aircraft and sustainment infrastructure in the Pacific, and still fail to prevent a global economic shock estimated at roughly $10 trillion, nearly a tenth of global GDP.\n\nSKIES AT STAKE: INSIDE THE US-CHINA RACE FOR AIR DOMINANCE\n\nAccording to the report's authors, the AI‑enabled model drew exclusively on open‑source government, academic, industry and commercial information. An unredacted version of the report was provided to authorized U.S. government recipients for internal use.\n\nUnlike traditional tabletop war games, TIDALWAVE employs an AI‑enabled model that runs thousands of iterations, tracking how losses in platforms, munitions, and fuel compound over time and drive cascading operational failure early in the conflict.\n\nAccording to a Heritage spokesperson, the report had been shown to \"high-level national security officials\" who requested some of the specifics be crossed out in black ink before its release to the public. The report still details how quickly U.S. forces could reach a breaking point and why the conflict would carry global consequences.\n\n\"Redactions were made at the request of the U.S. government to prevent disclosure of information that could reasonably enable an adversary to (1) re mediate or ‘close’ critical vulnerabilities that the United States and its allies could otherwise exploit, or (2) identify or exploit U.S. and allied vulnerabilities in ways that could degrade operational endurance, resilience, or deterrence,\" the report said.\n\nA Department of War spokesperson declined to comment on discussions surrounding TIDALWAVE's publication, but added: \"The Department of War does not endorse, validate, or adjudicate third-party analyses, nor do we engage publicly on hypothetical conflict modeling. As a general matter, we take seriously the protection of information that, if aggregated or contextualized, could have implications for operational security.\"\n\nThe White House could not be reached for comment.\n\nAccording to the report’s redacted findings, the U.S. would culminate in less than half the time required for the People's Republic of China in a high-intensity conflict. Culmination is defined as the point at which a force becomes incapable of continuing operations due to the loss of platforms, ammunition and/or fuel.\n\nThe report is explicit that the first 30 days to 60 days of a U.S.-China war determine its long-term shape and outcome, as early losses in aircraft, ships, fuel throughput and munitions rapidly compound and cannot be recovered on operationally relevant timelines.\n\nThe report concludes that the U.S. is not equipped nor arrayed to protect and sustain the Joint Force in a conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific. Rapid platform attrition, brittle logistics, concentrated basing and insufficient industrial surge capacity combine to force an early operational breaking point for American forces.\n\nThe report warns that U.S. reliance on a few large, concentrated forward bases — particularly in Japan and Guam — leaves American airpower dangerously exposed to Chinese missile forces.\n\nIn multiple scenarios, up to 90% of U.S. and allied aircraft positioned at major forward bases are destroyed on the ground during the opening phase of the conflict, as runways, fuel depots, command facilities and parked aircraft are hit simultaneously.\n\nThe report finds that critical U.S. precision‑guided munitions — including long‑range anti‑ship missiles, air‑to‑air interceptors and missile‑defense systems — begin to be unavailable within five to seven days of major combat operations. Across most scenarios, those critical munitions are completely exhausted within 35 days to 40 days, leaving U.S. forces unable to sustain high‑tempo combat.\n\nFuel emerges as the most decisive vulnerability of all. The report makes a critical distinction: the U.S. does not run out of fuel in most scenarios — it loses the ability to move fuel under fire.\n\nCHINA’S MISSILE SURGE PUTS EVERY US BASE IN THE PACIFIC AT RISK — AND THE WINDOW TO RESPOND IS CLOSING\n\nChinese doctrine explicitly prioritizes attacks on logistics vessels, ports, pipelines and replenishment tankers. Even limited tanker losses, port disruptions or pipeline severance are sufficient to drive fuel throughput below survivable levels, forcing commanders to sharply curtail air and naval operations despite fuel remaining in aggregate stockpiles.\n\nChinese ammunition stockpiles of critical munitions begin to be depleted after approximately 20 days to 30 days of major combat operations. However, substitution effects extend China’s ability to sustain combat operations out to months — well beyond the point at which U.S. forces culminate, according to the report.\n\nThe consequences extend far beyond the battlefield.\n\nThe redacted report concludes the U.S. is highly unlikely to prevent massive global economic fallout once a Taiwan conflict begins.\n\nDisruption of shipping lanes, destruction of critical infrastructure and the collapse of Taiwan’s semiconductor production would trigger a global economic shock estimated at roughly $10 trillion, with enduring ripple effects across financial markets, manufacturing and global trade.\n\nThe report comes amid years of concern over U.S. military readiness and industrial capacity, as China rapidly expands its naval forces and shipbuilding base.\n\nThe U.S. Navy operates a smaller fleet than planned, while American shipyards face workforce shortages, aging infrastructure and chronic delays — even as China, the world’s largest shipbuilder, continues to outpace the U.S. in producing new naval hulls.\n\nWar Secretary Pete Hegseth and other military leaders have vowed to put the Pentagon on a wartime footing for industrial capacity.\n\nPerhaps most alarming, TIDALWAVE warns that the scale of losses in the Indo‑Pacific would leave the U.S. unable to deter or respond effectively to a second major conflict elsewhere in the world.\n\nA war over Taiwan could open the door to follow‑on aggression by adversaries such as Russia, Iran or North Korea, fundamentally destabilizing the global security order.\n\nThe report is blunt in its assessment: existing Pentagon programs and congressional funding are too slow, too fragmented and too modest to address the scale of the challenge. In many cases, the timeline required to fix critical vulnerabilities exceeds the likely timeline to conflict.\n\nTo avoid what the authors describe as a strategic defeat, the report urges Congress to immediately expand munitions stockpiles, strengthen fuel reserves and distribution infrastructure, harden and disperse forward bases, and accelerate sustainment and logistics reforms. Without rapid action, the authors warn, the U.S. risks entering a conflict it is structurally unprepared to fight or sustain.\n\nWith intelligence warnings mounting that China could move on Taiwan before the end of the decade, TIDALWAVE cautions that the window to correct these deficiencies may be closing faster than Washington is prepared to act.",

    "description": "The figure offers insight into the war's growing financial toll as Kyiv pushes for more tools to defend against Russia.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces fired nearly $100 million worth of air defense missiles battling Russia's latest bombardment, Kyiv revealed on Tuesday, offering insight into the war's growing financial toll.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters that the Russian attack, which began Monday night and continued into Tuesday, forced Kyiv to launch around €80 million (roughly $94 million) worth of interceptor missiles.\n\n\"Imagine that — the cost of these missiles,\" Zelenskyy said over WhatsApp in response to a question about interceptor stockpiles.\n\nThe staggering figure covers only the interceptor missiles and does not appear to account for any other munitions expended to defend against the Russian attack, which also included hundreds of drones.\n\nRussia launched 18 ballistic missiles, 15 cruise missiles, and one anti-ship missile overnight, according to data from Ukraine's air force. It said in a statement that 27 were shot down, while five hit their targets.\n\nZelenskyy said Russia has \"significantly increased\" its use of ballistic missiles and has been able to obtain critical technology for the munitions from third-party countries and from industry.\n\n\"Nevertheless, their ability to produce these missiles must be reduced — and that is not happening yet,\" he said in response to another question.\n\nAlthough Ukraine has received some additional air defense systems from Western countries, Zelenskyy said more are still needed, along with additional interceptor missiles to keep pace with Russia's attacks.\n\nZelenskyy acknowledged that it has been difficult for Ukraine to obtain the necessary interceptor missiles. He specifically singled out the PAC-3, which has a $3.7 million price tag and is fired from US-made Patriot batteries, as the best chance Kyiv has to defeat Russian ballistic missiles.\n\n\"War is an extremely expensive Russian luxury, and for us it results in severe losses,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nRussian missiles are not the only worry for Ukraine. Moscow's overnight attack involved 339 drones. Kyiv said its Air Force shot down 315 of them. Two dozen hit their targets.\n\nTo preserve its costly air defense missiles, Ukraine has been increasingly relying on locally made interceptor drones that cost as little as a few thousand dollars to hunt down and destroy Russian drones.\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine is producing around 1,000 interceptor drones each day, a goal he set last summer. The challenge now, he said, is that the number of drones has outpaced the number of operators who can control them.\n\n\"Therefore, now we must catch up in terms of the number of interceptor groups — the corresponding mobile groups,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that he has tasked senior Ukrainian military leadership with bridging the gap.",

    "fullText": "Norway has issued thousands of letters to citizens warning that the army may have to seize their homes and vehicles if war breaks out with Russia.\n\nNorwegian military officials said the letters were an advance warning to those with assets that may need to be requisitioned.\n\nThe requisition policy covers vehicles, boats, machinery and property, and around 13,500 “preparatory requisitions” were issued on Monday, valid for one year.\n\n“The requisitions are intended to ensure that, in a wartime situation, the armed forces have access to the resources necessary for the defence of the country,” the Norwegian military said.\n\nThe letters will not have come as a shock to most recipients, as two thirds of them were simply renewing requisition notices from previous years.\n\nAnders Jernberg, the head of the military’s logistics organisation, said: “The importance of being prepared for crisis and war has increased dramatically in recent years.”\n\n“Norway is in the most serious security policy situation since the Second World War. Our society must be prepared for security policy crises and, in the worst case, war... we are undertaking a major build-up of military and civil preparedness,” he added.\n\nNorway plays a key role in Nato surveillance of the Arctic region, where the melting of the ice caps has created a scramble to secure new shipping routes and lucrative raw materials.\n\nThe Scandinavian country shares a maritime border – as well as a 123 mile-long land border – with Russia in the far northern Arctic region.\n\nRussia and China are seeking to expand their presence in the Arctic region, with the former building up old Soviet bases in the region and expanding its nuclear weapons stockpile on the Kola peninsula.\n\nThe requisition notices were issued amid an ongoing diplomatic crisis between the United States and Europe over president Donald Trump’s plans to annex Greenland, the minerals-rich Arctic island.\n\nMr Trump has cited Arctic security concerns as his main argument for annexing Greenland, an autonomous Danish overseas territory that is part of the Nato alliance.\n\nHe has threatened military action to take over the island, a step that would probably destroy the Western alliance even as it faces the growing risk of war with Russia.\n\nOn Monday, it emerged that Mr Trump also wants to take over Greenland because he is upset with Norway for refusing to give him a Nobel peace prize last year.\n\nDenmark and Greenland say the island is not for sale. They have the full support of Britain and the European Union.\n\nBut Sir Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister, said on Monday that he does not believe the United States is planning a military takeover of the island.\n\n“I don’t, actually. I think that this can be resolved and should be resolved through calm discussion, but with the application of the principles and values that I’ve set out in terms of who decides the future of Greenland, and making clear that the use of tariffs in this way is completely wrong,” he said.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Telegraph, Norway’s defence minister warned that Russia had recently launched a major expansion of its military bases in the Arctic region.\n\n“Russia is building up on the Kola peninsula ... where one of the largest arsenals of nuclear warheads in the world is located. They [the nuclear weapons] are not only pointed towards Norway, but towards the UK and over the pole towards Canada and the US,” Tore O. Sandvik told the Telegraph.\n\nMoscow is also trying to gain full control over the Arctic region in order to block Nato access to key shipping routes, he said.\n\n“We are the eyes and ears of Nato in this area, and we see that they’re testing new weapons, for example, hypersonic missiles, and they are testing nuclear-driven torpedoes and nuclear warheads,” he said.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "Zillow's hottest housing markets for 2026 highlight areas where there are high prices, low inventory, and stiff competition — particularly, the Northeast.",
    "fullText": "Competition is often inevitable when buying a home.\n\nWhile some are moving to the Sun Belt and Snow Belt seeking more affordable places to settle down, many other markets in the country remain expensive precisely because they're in demand.\n\nZillow released its predictions for the hottest markets going into 2026 based on home price growth and housing market competition, and Northeastern metros appear on the list more than any other region. No Sun Belt cities made the list at all.\n\n\"Markets are hotter where supply is more constrained,\" Zillow Chief Economist Mischa Fisher told Business Insider. \"That's why you see that very pronounced cluster in the Northeast, where it can take longer to build, or it can be harder to build, or it can be more costly to build. Whereas in the Sun Belt, if you look at the inventory available compared to demand, home prices are, in many of those markets, down year-over-year.\"\n\nWhat Zillow defines as \"hot\" doesn't just measure where homes are selling the fastest, but also how often sellers are forced to cut prices, how many homes sell over the asking price, and where demand outpaces supply.\n\nSome of the cities on the list, like San Jose, California, have a high Zillow Home Value Index ($1,558,466), but finished in the top 10 mainly because of other high-performing metrics.\n\nAccording to Zillow, 55.6% of sales in San Jose, California, were over the list price as of November 2025 due to an inventory drop. \"The inventory is still strained in those areas, so you still have enough to maintain a lot of competition among buyers there,\" Fisher said.\n\n\"Whether it's a lower home value index, like in Hartford, Connecticut, or a higher one, like in San Jose, California, in both cases, building is not particularly easy. So if that's where people want to be, you're going to be supply constrained, and you're going to see demand among buyers be pretty pronounced.\"\n\nAffordability remains a key factor for most when deciding where to live, but other elements also drive those decisions.\n\nZillow analyzed the nation's 50 most populous metros to determine which ones were the most in-demand. Here are the top 10 metros that Zillow predicts to be in high demand in 2026.\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $369,303\n\nHome Value Growth Forecast: 2.1%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $383,275\n\nHome Value Growth Forecast: 2.1%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $941,869\n\nHome Value Growth Forecast: 1.1%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $717,711\n\nHome Value Growth Forecast: 1.5%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $378,054\n\nHome Value Growth Forecast: 1.7%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $1,558,466\n\nHome Value Growth Forecast: 1.2%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $503,409\n\nHome Value Growth Forecast: 3.0%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $704,284\n\nHome Value Growth Forecast: 1.5%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $277,499\n\nHome Value Growth Forecast: 2.5%\n\nZillow Home Value Index: $381,760\n\nHome Value Growth Forecast: 3.9%",

    "title": "The War on Drugs Is Why Your Bus Never Showed Up",
    "description": "Your bus didn’t show up because someone who could have driven it wasn’t allowed to take the job. Not because they couldn’t do it safely. Because they smoked weed two weeks ago.",
    "fullText": "You’re standing at the bus stop. The app said the bus would arrive in 3 minutes. Then 5 minutes. Then it just disappears from the tracker entirely. No bus. No explanation. Just another 45-minute wait for the next one, assuming that one actually shows up.\n\nThis isn’t a story about infrastructure or funding.\n\nIt’s about United States federal drug policy.\n\nMore than 90% of transit agencies across the US can’t hire enough bus drivers.1 Not because people don’t want the jobs—because federal law won’t let them take them.\n\nIn Baltimore, one in five buses don’t complete their runs.2 LA Metro is short 600 drivers and cancels 10% of scheduled service every single day.3 Miami postponed its entire bus network redesign because it couldn’t find people to drive the new routes.4\n\nBefore the pandemic, LA Metro missed 1-2% of scheduled trips. Now it’s 10%. That’s not a marginal decline—that’s system failure.\n\nHere’s the problem: Under federal law (49 CFR Part 382), anyone with a commercial driver’s license must pass DOT drug tests that include marijuana.5 No exceptions.\n\nThis applies to every transit bus operator in America, regardless of what state law says about marijuana.\n\nNotably, these mandates do not apply to Uber or Lyft drivers.\n\nThe tests don’t measure impairment–they detect THC metabolites that linger for weeks after use.\n\nSomeone who smoked on Saturday tests positive on Monday despite being completely sober.\n\nOne positive test goes into a federal database and effectively ends your driving career.\n\nAccording to 2024 federal data, 44 million American adults used marijuana in the past month.6\n\nThat’s 15% of the US adult population—-the exact population transit agencies need to recruit from.\n\nTransit agencies are desperate to hire. They’re offering bonuses, raising wages, running recruitment campaigns.\n\nBut federal policy immediately disqualifies 15-25% of otherwise qualified applicants before they even walk in the door.\n\nThink about that math. There are 159,000 transit bus operators nationwide.7\n\nAgencies report shortages of 600-800 drivers at single large systems.\n\nThe workforce shortage is measured in thousands and federal policy is excluding millions.\n\nIn 24 states, recreational marijuana is already legal. In 38 states, medical marijuana is legal.8\n\nYou can walk into a licensed dispensary in Los Angeles, Denver, or Seattle, buy marijuana legally, use it at home on the weekend, and be permanently barred from driving a bus on Monday.\n\nEight states have passed laws explicitly protecting workers from employment discrimination based on off-duty marijuana use.9\n\nBut all those protections include an exception: they don’t apply if federal law requires drug testing. The state laws can’t override DOT regulations.\n\nSo someone in California (where marijuana has been legal for years) can be fired from a bus driving job or never hired in the first place for doing something that’s completely legal under state law.\n\nNot because they’re impaired at work, but because they tested positive for something they did on their own time that violated no state law.\n\nWhen agencies can’t hire drivers, the consequences are immediate and measurable:\n\nBuses don’t show up. Before the shortage, major agencies completed 98-99% of scheduled runs. Now many are at 85-90%. Each missed bus means missed connections, doubled wait times, and overcrowded buses when one finally arrives.\n\nRoutes get cut. Rhode Island cut service on 21 routes citing driver shortages.10 Pittsburgh reduced scheduled service by 4%.11 These aren’t strategic decisions—they’re forced reductions because there aren’t enough people to drive the buses that already exist.\n\nRiders give up. When you can’t trust the bus to show up, you stop planning your life around it. You buy a car. You take an Uber. You move closer to work. The system loses riders not because of a single bad trip, but because unreliability makes it unusable.\n\nRemoving marijuana from CDL drug testing wouldn’t cost transit agencies anything. They don’t need to buy new buses, build new facilities, or hire more mechanics. They just need access to the millions of workers federal law currently bars them from hiring.\n\nRight now agencies are spending thousands per driver on signing bonuses and retention incentives—band-aids that don’t fix the underlying problem.\n\nMeanwhile, 44 million Americans who could do the job are legally prohibited from applying.\n\nThe current policy forces agencies to compete for the 75-85% of adults who haven’t used marijuana recently, while excluding a massive pool of qualified workers for no reason related to job performance or safety.\n\nThe tests don’t measure safety. They measure past use.\n\nSomeone can be stone sober, fully capable of safely operating a bus, and still fail a marijuana test from use days or weeks earlier.\n\nMeanwhile, the same test won’t catch someone who’s exhausted, hungover, on cold medicine, or impaired by any number of other factors that actually affect driving.\n\nNew York’s Department of Labor has explicitly said employers can’t test for marijuana because the tests don’t measure workplace impairment—they measure past behavior that has no bearing on current job performance.12\n\nIf safety is the concern, there are performance-based impairment tests that measure actual ability to do the job, regardless of cause.\n\nThose tests would catch impairment from any \n\nCurrent marijuana testing doesn’t do that.\n\nFederal marijuana policy treats cannabis like heroin—Schedule I, high potential for abuse, no medical value. That classification is why transit agencies must test for it. It’s also completely divorced from reality, medical research, and the laws in 38 states.\n\nThe fix is simple: remove marijuana from DOT drug testing requirements. That’s it. Transit agencies could immediately start hiring from a pool of 44 million additional workers. Service would improve overnight at zero cost to taxpayers.\n\nThe buses exist. The routes are planned. The riders are waiting.\n\nThe only thing missing is drivers—and federal drug policy is the reason they can’t get hired.\n\nYour bus didn’t show up because someone who could have driven it wasn’t allowed to take the job.\n\nNot because they couldn’t do it safely.\n\nBecause they smoked weed two weeks ago.\n\nAmerican Public Transportation Association, Transit Workforce Shortage Study (2022) ↩\n\nGoverning, A Bus Driver Shortage Threatens Transit (October 31, 2022) ↩\n\nStreetsblog LA, Missed Runs and Crowded Buses: Metro Falls Short of Restoring Full Pre-COVID Transit Service (October 1, 2021) ↩\n\nTransitCenter, Bus Operators in Crisis (2022) ↩\n\nFederal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, 49 CFR Part 382 - Controlled Substances and Alcohol Use and Testing ↩\n\nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Key Substance Use and Mental Health Indicators in the United States: Results from the 2024 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2024) ↩\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Employment and Wages: Bus Drivers, Transit and Intercity (May 2024) ↩\n\nMarijuana Policy Project, Cannabis Legalization and Employment Protections ↩\n\nGovDocs, Marijuana Laws by State: Employee Protections (August 20, 2025) ↩\n\nGoverning, A Bus Driver Shortage Threatens Transit (October 31, 2022) ↩\n\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette, Port Authority to reduce service because of driver shortage (May 19, 2022) ↩\n\nAnderson Kill, New York Bans Employers From Testing (Most) Employees And Job Applicants For Marijuana (June 16, 2025) ↩",

    "fullText": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says President Donald Trump is serious about annexing Greenland.\n\nTrump amped up the rhetoric on Saturday, announcing on Truth Social that the United States would impose new tariffs on Denmark, which controls Greenland, and other European countries unless they hand Greenland over.\n\nSpeaking to Kristen Welker on NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, Bessent said Trump's push to take over Greenland was not an empty land grab but a strategy to prevent future conflict.\n\n\"The national emergency is avoiding a national emergency,\" Bessent said. \"It is a strategic decision by the president. This is a geopolitical decision, and he's able to use the economic might of the US to avoid a hot war, so why wouldn't we do that?\"\n\nGreenland is strategically located in the Arctic, acting as a buffer between North America and Russia. It is also home to minerals important to the manufacturing of future technologies.\n\nTrump has recently said that at least part of his reasoning for wanting to annex Greenland is so it can house his Golden Dome missile defense project.\n\n\"The president is trying to avoid a conflict,\" Bessent said.\n\nThat project remains in early planning stages, however, and Denmark has never said it wouldn't allow Golden Dome infrastructure on its territory. The United States already has a military base in Greenland.\n\nThe spectre that the United States — recently emboldened by its surprise raid on Venezuela that netted its leader, Nicolás Maduro, allowing it to move to open the country's oil industry — could force Europe's hand by targeting its economy or even take Greenland by force, has rankled US allies across the Atlantic.\n\nEuropean Union leaders held an emergency meeting on Sunday, during which they called Trump's tariff threat economic blackmail.\n\n\"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral,\" the eight EU nations targeted by Trump said in a joint statement released on Sunday.",

    "description": "How do you auction off an armor-plated Mercedes-Benz? Here's a behind-the-scenes look at a virtual bidding war where no one bothers to kick the tires.",
    "fullText": "How do you auction off a former billionaire's armor-plated Mercedes?\n\nAs with virtually every bankruptcy auction these days, there's a one-word answer to that question — online.\n\nBusiness Insider followed the auction of a Mercedes-Benz Maybach S650, kicking the tires in person and watching the virtual action as it sold online to its 115th bidder, for $63,000.\n\nThe sale shows just how easy it is for buyers to purchase — sight unseen — the cars, motorcycles, even the cast-off wall sconces and used vacuum cleaners of the nouveau poor. All that's needed is an internet connection and the winning bid.\n\nBut behind the scenes, a small army of lawyers, bankruptcy judges, appraisers, and auctioneers labor to make it happen. It took four years of real-life effort before the virtual gavel fell on Thursday, and the Mercedes found its new owner.\n\nHere is the journey of a billionaire's luxury sedan — from a showroom in Manhattan, to a tow lot in New Jersey, and finally to the yard of a Connecticut auction house, where almost no one bothered to see the car in person before bidding tens of thousands of dollars to own it.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz was once the shiny new chauffeured conveyance of Miles Guo, who declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy in early 2022.\n\nGuo was arrested a year later and remains in jail pending his Manhattan sentencing for a $1.3 billion fraud and racketeering-conspiracy scheme.\n\nCourt records show that Guo bought the car new in 2018, for $192,000, at a Mercedes-Benz showroom just south of Lincoln Center in Manhattan. It was, relatively speaking, one of his economy cars. Federal prosecutors said Guo's custom Bugatti Chiron, his costliest ride, was purchased for $4.4 million.\n\nThe four-door Benz was built for luxury.\n\n\"There's a mini-bar back here,\" auctioneer Mike Knudson said, giving Business Insider a tour of the car on Wednesday. The car was parked outside The Hamilton Group, the Connecticut auction and appraisal company he runs with his wife, Amy Maklari.\n\nKnudson leaned into the back seat and popped the door on the empty fridge between the rear seats. \"Two small bottles,\" Knudson said, estimating its capacity. \"Maybe a Coke, too.\"\n\nThe Mercedes' amenities also include a small jar that Knudson discovered only Wednesday, in the glove compartment, set inside a recessed holder called a \"flacon.\"\n\n\"What's this?\" he asked, pulling the jar out. The smear of amber-colored gum inside was scent for the Mercedes' diffuser system, controllable through high, medium, and low settings on the dashboard computer.\n\n\"Aroma therapy,\" Knudson joked, returning the jar, labeled \"Agarwood,\" to its holder.\n\nThe car was built for safety, too.\n\nGuo paid extra to have a German company install armor plating and bulletproof glass throughout. \"See how thick this glass is?\" Knudson told Business Insider, lowering one of the windows.\n\nGuo's bankruptcy trustee has spent years demonstrating the true ownership of Guo's cars, planes, and mansions, and linking these assets back to Guo.\n\nThe Mercedes, just one small piece of the bankruptcy puzzle, had been listed as an asset held by a Hong Kong-based shell company — in the name of Guo's son and, briefly, his chauffeur.\n\nAfter Guo's arrest, the car wound up abandoned in a New Jersey tow lot. It had to be moved via flatbed to the Hamilton Group's yard in Clinton, Connecticut, a half-hour east of New Haven.\n\nIt took Knudson another month or so to ready the car for auction. He needed to obtain a bond, replace the battery, and get an electronic key fob made by Mercedes-Benz specialists.\n\n\"That's when I learned it's pronounced \"My-bach,\" not \"May-bach,\" said Knudson, who has also auctioned furnishings and knick-knacks from Guo's Manhattan penthouse and his fleet of high-end motorcycles — \"one Ducati, two BMWs, and three Harleys,\" Maklari said.\n\nWednesday was the only day during the ten-day auction that the public could drop by without an appointment and personally examine the Mercedes. Not a single person showed up, besides Business Insider.\n\nOnline the next day, though, the bidding for the car, which had just 21,000 miles on the odometer, was strong.\n\nTwenty-four hours before the auction was to close, more than 80 bidders on BidSpotter.com had pushed the price up to $38,000.\n\nIn the last hour of bidding, interest accelerated. In the last five minutes, bidding climbed suddenly in $1,000 increments until it reached the winning bid of $63,000.\n\nThe sale price is in line with the Kelley Blue Book value, which sets the current resale value for a 2018 Mercedes-Benz Maybach S650 at $62,400 — not counting the custom armor plating and bullet-proof glass Guo had installed.\n\nPeople feel safe bidding on something so expensive — without actually seeing it in person — because of the clarity of auction listings.\n\nThe Mercedes' listing on BidSpotter included 49 photographs and a two-minute video. The clip shows Knudson popping the hood and trunk, and driving it around Hamilton Auction's front lot.\n\nPotential bidders could hear Knudson start and rev the car's engine, and watch as his camera lingered on a small ding in the rear right bumper and a hair-thin, vertical crack in the windshield.\n\nThere are dozens of online auction platforms catering to bankruptcies, estate sales, and companies and individuals with something to sell.\n\nMaklari ticked off a few names on Wednesday. AuctionNinja specializes in estates and furnishings. ProxiBid and BidSpotter deals in vehicles and heavy machinery. LiveAuctioneers handles collectibles and antiques.\n\nFor auctioneers, listing on these sites is an art.\n\nKnudson said he had appraised the Mercedes very conservatively, at around $35,000, for the bankruptcy trustee. But for the ten-day auction's launch, he had set the minimum bid at a strategically low-balled $20,000.\n\n\"It gets people engaged,\" he explained.\n\nThere's no risk to such lowballing, he said. \"Most assets will find their fair-market value these days,\" he said. \"People have a lot of ways, with the internet, to do their research.\"\n\nThe car's new owner wished to remain anonymous. Whoever they are, they'll need to pay a 15% fee to the auction company, and are responsible for their own transportation.\n\nThe sale proceeds will now go into the bankruptcy estate, where it will help pay off Guo's many creditors.\n\nIt's a drop in the bucket, given that Guo's bankruptcy debts hover around half a billion dollars.\n\n\"One Mercedes-Benz won't help anything,\" said Kevin Tung, the Queens, New York, lawyer for nine China-based contractors who say Guo owes them a combined $100 million. \"That's small potatoes.\"",

    "title": "Arms makers say that the fast-moving war in Ukraine is changing how they design and upgrade weapons",
    "description": "The fight in Ukraine changes so rapidly that weapons makers can't afford to constantly overhaul and redevelop whole systems.",
    "fullText": "The battlefield in Ukraine is changing constantly, and weapons makers are rushing to keep up.\n\nDrone and ground robot makers said they're designing their systems in ways that allow them to be easily updated.\n\nThey're either modular, meaning parts can be swapped out, or designed so software changes are all that's needed.\n\nRapid changes on the battlefield in Ukraine are prompting Western weapons manufacturers to reassess how military technology is developed and upgraded.\n\nWith the fight evolving quickly, arms companies in Ukraine and Europe say that they can't afford to start from scratch and completely redesign entire systems each time conditions shift.\n\nInstead, companies making aerial drones and ground robots told Business Insider that their focus is now on creating weapons that can be upgraded by simply changing parts or software rather than overhauling the whole system.\n\nDesigns are modular, like Lego pieces, with parts being easily swapped out as new mission demands arise. Increasingly, companies are turning to software-first designs for more convenient upgrades.\n\nDefense technology has been moving in this direction, but revelations from Russia's war against Ukraine are injecting new urgency.\n\nPatrick Shepherd, the chief sales officer for Milrem Robotics, an Estonian company that makes autonomous uncrewed ground vehicles and has some in Ukraine, said that these changes are key to staying ahead, as they provide much faster adaptation than what \"traditional, monolithic designs\" permit.\n\nUkraine's soldiers say that battlefield tech can become out of date in weeks and months, with electronic warfare, new drone countermeasures, and new tactics blunting once-effective systems.\n\nAmong the companies involved in this evolving technology battle is DroneShield, an Australian company that develops counter-drone technology and operates across Europe. It has multimillion-dollar US military contracts and has multiple systems in Ukraine.\n\nMatt McCrann, CEO of DroneShield's US arm, said that the drone and counter-drone fight has sped up globally since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, cutting development cycles to weeks rather than months or years.\n\nThe only way to keep pace, he said, is to build \"systems that are not fixed, solving the problem of today, but ones that can address an issue today and adapt as needed.\"\n\nLithuanian drone company Granta Autonomy was one of the first companies to send drones to Ukraine. CEO Gediminas Guoba said the company needs to build systems that are not simply ready for this year or the next, but can be updated and upgraded for new operations even further into the future.\n\nThat means building systems that can be easily reworked. Anything else, he said, and \"we will lose the battle.\"\n\nMcCrann said the faster development cycle is why DroneShield has put greater emphasis on modular and adaptable designs.\n\nLikewise, Shepherd said that Milrem builds flexibility into its systems from the outset, allowing sensors, payloads, mission systems, and other components to be integrated, removed, or upgraded without redesigning the entire vehicle.\n\nAchi, the CEO of Ukraine's Ark Robotics, which makes autonomous robots used by nearly two dozen Ukrainian brigades, said the company focuses on making its platforms \"as cheap and as mass producible as possible.\" He spoke to Business Insider using a pseudonym as a security precaution.\n\n\"And then when we get this right, we can do surface-level customization,\" like adding armor or additional equipment. The base platform remains the same, letting the company scale production without driving up costs.\n\nLatvia-based Origin Robotics manufactures both drones and drone interceptors used by Ukrainian and NATO forces. Its CEO, Agris Kipurs, told BI that the company also prioritizes modular systems to adapt quickly to battlefield changes.\n\nModular designs aren't just for companies striving to keep their edge in a competitive industry. Warfighters need them too. Ukrainian soldiers have said they need flexible systems that can be easily modified at the front.\n\nOleksandr Yabchanka, the head of robotic systems for Ukraine's Da Vinci Wolves Battalion, previously told Business Insider that the ground robots his unit uses can be configured for different missions, be it evacuating wounded troops or attacking Russian positions. He said the robots work like Lego bricks.\n\nShepherd said that Milrem's robots follow the same logic, avoiding designs built around a single mission. They can be customized by soldiers for evacuation, explosive disposal, intelligence gathering, or weaponized roles.\n\nIn some cases, soldiers adapt systems in ways manufacturers did not anticipate.\n\nWestern companies say they are learning from those changes. McCrann said Ukraine has been technologically innovative \"because they have to be,\" and that this is driving industry adaptation.\n\nCompanies sometimes have group chats and FaceTime calls with Ukrainian soldiers to get real-time feedback, and weapons software is where they can make the biggest changes the fastest.\n\nShepherd said that software is now playing a central role in adapting systems, whether for command-and-control integration or mission management. \"Software updates can be developed, tested, and deployed much more quickly, allowing lessons learned from the field to be integrated on shorter timescales,\" he said.\n\nMcCrann said DroneShield has focused on a software-first approach, where upgrades add new capabilities without hardware modifications.\n\nGuoba said Granta Autonomy's drones have not changed much over the last year or two, but the software inside them, on the other hand, \"is changing every month.\"\n\nSoftware can be remotely pushed to weaponry already in Ukraine, eliminating the need to ship gear back to the factory. That speed, and the ability to test changes quickly, has made software the preferred tool for rapid adaptation.\n\nUltimately, Ark Robotics' Achi said, \"software is easier to do.\"\n\nArk's aerial drones and ground robots rely on onboard and server-based software, and the company is developing systems to allow thousands of platforms to operate together with minimal human involvement.\n\nHe said Ark also deploys engineers forward to implement software changes tailored to specific units or missions. It follows a similar approach for hardware, though those changes take longer to implement.\n\nKipurs said Origin makes its systems \"software-intensive\" so development is continuous, \"with updates regularly pushed to improve systems that have already been delivered.\"\n\nIt only uses hardware changes \"when they provide clear benefits across all intended users.\" Because the company also builds for NATO customers, systems must remain broadly interoperable.\n\nShepherd said companies still need to strike a balance. Systems must remain reliable, so not every update can be rushed to the field. The key, he said, is close collaboration with Ukrainian soldiers and fast but disciplined feedback loops.",

    "description": "Andrea...",
    "fullText": "Formed to oppose the Iraq War, Madres Contra La Guerra have now spent decades trying to end Puerto Rico’s role at the center of the US war machine in Latin America.\n\nIn a blurry black-and-white Polaroid from 1971, Sonia Santiago Hernández reenacts an image of the Madonna and Child. Only 21 years old, she wears a miniskirt and sandals, and oversize sunglasses sit perched on her forehead. She stands in contrapposto outside the University of Puerto Rico Rio Piedras in San Juan, gazing serenely at her newborn son Gabriel. Since his birth, Gabriel had been her companion at every Vietnam War protest that she attended, shuffling between student comrades who took turns holding him. In the months before her pregnancy, Santiago had been on hunger strike for 26 days.\n\nOn a colonized island where one-third of all Puerto Rican women had been forcefully sterilized from the 1930s to the ’70s, holding the baby for a photo felt like an act of resistance. Gabriel was raised in a house plastered with peace-sign magnets, pins, posters, and stickers—his playpen devoid of toy guns or weapons.\n\n“Maternity is life,” Santiago told me. “War is death. We fight for peace.”\n\nIn 2003, the United States invaded Iraq, and Puerto Rico became overrun with military recruiters. Lurking in malls, colleges, and other youth haunts, they promised financial benefits and opportunity for those who enlisted. More than 38,000 Boricua youth were deployed—including Gabriel.\n\nSantiago’s grief and devastation at her son’s involvement in US war led her to found Madres Contra La Guerra, or Mothers Against War, in May 2003. When the United States attacked Venezuela and abducted Nicolás Maduro on January 3, killing 80 people in the process, Santiago saw Iraq’s history repeating itself. She found herself ridden by the same indignation. “Once again, they are trying to justify their aggression under the rhetoric of narcotrafficking, falsely attributing the origin of drugs in the region to Venezuela,” Santiago said in a Madres’ press release, recalling the threat of weapons of mass destruction that convinced her son to enlist in Iraq. “This is a fabricated narrative designed to cover up a war of plunder.”\n\nAfter waking up to the news in Caracas, Madres coordinated a protest with the Venezuelan Solidarity Network outside of the federal building in San Juan. Their message, beyond an end to the escalation, was directed at Puerto Rican youth soldiers: Don’t become accomplices to the war on Venezuela.\n\nThe attacks of January 3 did not surprise Santiago and other Puerto Ricans, who over the last several months had seen military training exercises take over their public beaches. Since the United States sank the first Venezuelan ship in early September, the supposedly dormant Roosevelt Roads naval base in Ceiba came back to life. The last few months brought the largest military ramp up in the Caribbean since the 1994 invasion of Haiti. Ceibeños often hear the deafening noise of the fighter jets. Their silverware trembles and their lamps shake as F-35s, V-22 Ospreys, and UH-60 Black Hawks roar overhead. Some 15,000 US soldiers have been garrisoned at the base.\n\nLong before the US started its war games with Venezuela, Puerto Rico had operated as the linchpin of the US invasions in the region. In 1954, US militia invaded Guatemala from the Ramey Base in Aguadilla as part of a coup against President Jacobo Arbenz, whose agrarian reform threatened the profits of the United Fruit Company. In 1965, US troops trained in Roosevelt Roads were sent to the Dominican Republic following the overthrow of Juan Bosch. In 1983, Puerto Rico served as a staging ground for the US invasion of Grenada, and again for the 1989 invasion of Panama. Maduro’s first stop on his way out of Venezuela was through Aguadilla. In the now-viral image of Maduro in a gray Nike Tech jumpsuit, he clutches a Nikini water bottle, a brand sold in Puerto Rico.\n\nSantiago notes that the invasions that preceded the attacks on Venezuela were also a reflection—not of “manifest destiny” but of US economic and geopolitical interests. “They are using this invasion to guarantee forced access to their resources, the oil and natural resources that belong to the Venezuelan people.” Venezuela has the world’s largest proven oil reserves, which will now trade exclusively with the United States.\n\nWhat began as an anti-recruitment group advocating for conscientious objection to the Iraq War became an organization devoted to peaceful civil disobedience. Since its inception, the group’s protests have shut down the entry points of prominent recruitment centers and military bases. Madres’ coalition of 200 families formed part of a broad anti-military resistance in Puerto Rico, which, in addition to protesting the Iraq War, was trying to push the US military out of Vieques.\n\nVieques is a tiny appendage off the eastern coast of Puerto Rico that housed the Vieques Naval Training Range, the construction of which displaced 10,000 Viequenses. The US military used the base to perform countless experiments with toxic weapons, including agent orange, napalm, white phosphorus, and heavy metals. In 1999, a bombing accident killed a local security guard, David Sanes Rodriguez. That year, activist and Independence Party president Rubén Berríos began a year-long civil sit-in at the navy’s high-impact zone, sparking a wave of fierce opposition. A few years later, Vieques closed; along with it, the Roosevelt Roads Naval Base, once one of the largest bases in the world.\n\nThe media often uses the word “remilitarization” to describe the situation in Puerto Rico.Santiago rejects that characterization. “It’s not ‘remilitarization’; it’s reactivation,” she said. “They’re doing the same thing they always did. They were just passive for a while. But they never left.”\n\nThe “passive” period that Santiago mentions was filled with broken promises. When the military shuttered Vieques, it promised a cleanup, but thousands of acres remain contaminated. Cancer rates are 30 percent higher in Vieques than on the rest of the island. Fort Allen, Camp Santiago, and Fort Buchanan never closed. Nor did the Muñiz Air National Guard Base in Carolina, where Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth spouted made-up propaganda about a fictional Venezuelan drug cartel.\n\nImmediately following the January 3 attacks on Venezuela, the US military held “Army of the Caribbean Week ’26” at Fort Buchanan. It is the first event of its kind, and it involved deploying thousands of troops and beefing up military equipment for a week of training in a “commitment to duty and readiness in the Caribbean.” Press releases about Army Week are vague, intentionally distanced from Venezuela, but Trump warned that he could target Colombia, Cuba, and Mexico next. If that happens, it’s more than likely that Puerto Rico will again be the staging ground.\n\nThe strikes on Venezuelan ships came from Roosevelt Roads, and it led Madres Contra La Guerra to block the entry to the base for the first time in 20 years. Now 67, Santiago leads a group of mothers, elders, and youth in a bus en route to Ceiba. She wears red lipstick and a black peace-sign T-shirt that reads, “War is the Antithesis of Life.” Over the clamor of helicopters, the Madres chant, “Basta ya, basta ya, No a guerra criminal”—“Stop it now, Stop it now, No to criminal wars”—to the percussive rhythms of bomba (ironically and unrelatedly, Spanish for “bomb”). Accompanying the protesters is a group of drummers, Tambores Por Palestina.\n\nA central tenet of the Madres’ philosophy is solidarity with other colonized countries and mothers. It began with Iraq and has now extended toPalestine and Venezuela. Every Tuesday since October 2023, Madres can be found wearing keffiyehs outside the Israeli consulate in San Juan leading the islands’ most prominent anti-genocide protests. Their visibility has earned Madres multiple visits from the FBI. Yet they remain unflinchingly vocal about the shared colonial struggle of Palestine and Puerto Rico, swinging both flags in communion.\n\nSimilarly, Madres often refer to Venezuela as a “sister country.” “We understand that Venezuela, like every Latin American country, is being accosted by US imperialist interests,” Santiago said. “But beyond that, there’s an enormous cultural and linguistic affinity between us, a shared history of liberation struggles.” Santiago references Simón Bolívar in Venezuela and Ramón Emeterio Betances in Puerto Rico, whose cries for independence reverberate through present decolonial movements across the island.\n\nEric Blanc, Wes McEnany, and Claire Sandberg\n\nFeature\n\n /\n\n Dani McClain\n\nA significant element of Madres activism is fighting for restitution for the 1898 Treaty of Paris, the agreement that handed over Puerto Rico, Cuba, Philippines, Hawaii, and Guam to the United States after the Spanish-American War and made them de facto military colonies. Santiago sees the treaty as the origins of Puerto Rico as a colonial war laboratory. “It’s important to emphasize it, denounce it, and demand reparations. They need to return those lands on a national level,” Santiago said. “Those aren’t Roosevelt’s roads, those are the roads of my people, the Ceibeños. They steal land and then name it after themselves. It’s not right.”\n\nSantiago still speaks of motherhood with reverence and affection. She claims it is the undercurrent of her solidarity and her struggle for peace. “When you create life, you’re not thinking that you will raise them to kill or be killed,” she said, evoking her son Gabriel, now a veteran who struggles with PTSD. “That thread of maternity can be extrapolated not only onto your child, but for all of humanity.”\n\nHer words echo the sentiments of “militant mother” movements across Latin America—Madres de la Plaza de Mayo in Argentina and Madres Buscadoras in Mexico. Santiago and some of her peers have travelled to Argentina. They’ve broken bread with mothers in Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador and accompanied them in their grief and sense of political possibility. Santiago maintains that the maternity knows no border.\n\nThere’s anger, frustration, and indignation embedded in mothers’ movements like Madres Contra la Guerra. Yet Santiago stressed revolutionary kindness above all. “Maternity is derived from tenderness and love. Solidarity is tenderness between communities,” she explained, recalling Venezuela, Palestine, and her own children. “It’s really simple. It’s philosophical, yes, but it’s actually the simplest feeling there is.”",

    "fullText": "Military veterans aged 65 face being mobilised under new powers to prepare the Armed Forces for war.\n\nThe Government is set to increase the age at which the nation’s pool of retired soldiers, known as the strategic reserve, can be called upon from 55 to 65.\n\nThe new measures are being introduced as part of a new Armed Forces bill, which will be published in Parliament later.\n\nThe changes will make it easier to mobilise tens of thousands of former military personnel.\n\nThe Army has shrunk to its smallest number in more than 200 years, with just over 70,000 full-time, fully-trained troops ready to deploy to the frontline.\n\nUnder existing rules, the pool of retired soldiers can be called upon in the event of “national danger, great emergency or attack in the UK”.\n\nHowever, under the new changes, this will be lowered to “warlike preparations”, which is already the threshold for reservists who have recently left the Armed Forces.\n\nThe measures come amid fears Britain could be dragged into a full-scale war with Russia in a matter of years.\n\nDefence and security chiefs have repeatedly warned of the potential for large-scale war in recent months.\n\nAl Carns, the Armed Forces minister, said just before Christmas that war was “already knocking on Europe’s door” and that Britain had to be prepared for a conflict that was “bigger” than those fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nLast week, the UK announced it would be deploying troops to Ukraine, alongside France, if and when a ceasefire deal between Moscow and Kyiv is agreed.\n\nWhile it is unclear exactly how many troops could be involved, reports have suggested up to 7,500 UK personnel could be deployed.\n\nIf this figure is accurate, it would effectively mean that around 21,000 personnel would be committed to Ukraine – with one cohort deployed, another in training and a third recovering for operations there.\n\nHowever, military analysts have warned such a deployment would stretch the Armed Forces and would effectively become an “all of Army effort” to maintain.\n\nSources at the Ministry of Defence have pushed back against suggestions that 7,500 troops could be deployed, with insiders saying it could be lower.\n\nOn Friday, the Government pledged to spend £200m to upgrade armoured vehicles and buy new kit in preparation for the peacekeeping mission.\n\nThe proposed changes would come into force next year if approved by Parliament, the BBC reported.\n\nThe Government estimates there are around 95,000 people within the strategic reserve, including veterans from the Royal Navy, Army, and RAF.\n\nThese are different to the reserve forces, which comprise personnel who volunteer part-time to serve in the military. Currently, there are almost 32,000 active reservists across the three wings of the Armed Forces.\n\nThe military has struggled to recruit and retain personnel in recent years. The Army has suffered the most, having shrunk from more than 100,000 personnel in 2010 to just over 70,000 now.\n\nThe most recent figures show a very marginal increase in the number of people joining the military. But it is still at its lowest ebb since the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nMeanwhile, the Armed Forces is grappling with a £28 billion funding black hole over the next four years despite plans to boost defence spending.\n\nSir Keir Starmer was warned about the shortfall by the head of the military, Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Knighton, a few days before Christmas.\n\nOn Monday, Sir Richard admitted Britain did not have the cash to deliver its military ambitions, which were set out by the PM in June as part of the Strategic Defence Review.\n\nThe Chief of the Defence Staff told MPs on the Commons defence committee: “I’ll be completely honest with you – we will not be able to do everything that we would wish to do as quickly as we might want to do it.\n\n“If we wanted to do everything that’s currently in the programme and do all the extra things in the SDR [strategic defence review], could we do that with the budget that we have got? The answer’s no.”\n\nThis is despite Sir Keir having announced last year that defence spending would rise from 2.3 per cent of GDP to 2.6 per cent by 2027. Looser pledges were also made in the strategic defence review to hit 3 per cent in the early 2030s and 3.5 per cent by 2035.\n\nAs part of the Strategic Defence Review, Sir Keir vowed to build 12 new nuclear attack submarines and spend billions more on new defence technology.\n\nBritain’s military spending is the subject of increasing criticism, with a parliamentary report last year warning the country was not ready to defend itself against attack.\n\nEarlier this month, the UK fell down the global defence spending rankings, and is now Nato’s 12th-biggest spender in terms of GDP compared with third in 2021.\n\nNews of the latest shortfall is said to have prompted Sir Keir to order a key MoD document, the defence investment plan, to be overhauled.\n\nThe Defence Investment Plan, which will set out how the Government’s long-term defence plans will be paid for, was originally due to be published in the autumn. However, it now appears to be stuck in financial purgatory, with Sir Richard telling MPs the MoD “do not have a date” for when it will be released.\n\nIt prompted concerns that the Armed Forces could soon be forced to make sweeping cuts to balance the books.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "Greenland's natural resources and proximity to Russia and China have made it a valuable strategic asset to the US military since World War II.",
    "fullText": "Visitors to Pituffik Space Base in Greenland are greeted by a sign welcoming them to the \"top of the world.\"\n\nAs the US military's northernmost installation, Pituffik Space Base's operations include scientific research, space surveillance, and missile detection.\n\nGreenland's abundant natural resources and proximity to Russia and China have made it a valuable strategic asset since World War II — so much so that US President Donald Trump has often expressed his intent to purchase the autonomous Danish territory.\n\nVice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance visited the military base in March 2025 amid rising tensions between the US, Denmark, and Greenland.\n\nThose tensions have continued to flare as Trump has refused to rule out the use of military force to take control of Greenland. In a Truth Social post on Wednesday, Trump wrote that the US \"needs Greenland\" and \"anything less than that is unacceptable.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Denmark increased its military presence in Greenland, citing \"security tensions.\" Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio also met with the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland on Wednesday.\n\nHere's a look inside Greenland's only US military base.\n\nTrump first expressed interest in buying Greenland, the world's largest island and an autonomous Danish territory, during his first presidency. In addition to being rich in natural resources, Greenland's Arctic location is well-placed to further US interests by countering China and Russia.\n\nSince his reelection, Trump has repeatedly conveyed his desire to acquire Greenland and said he would not rule out the use of military force to take it.\n\n\"We need Greenland for national security. One way or the other we're going to get it,\" he said in his joint address to Congress in March 2025.\n\nBoth Denmark and Greenland's leaders have maintained that the island is not for sale.\n\nSecond lady Usha Vance was originally scheduled to visit Greenland on a solo trip in 2025 to \"visit historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersua, Greenland's national dogsled race,\" the White House said.\n\nInstead, the trip was scaled back. The vice president and second lady visited Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, the US military's northernmost installation, in March.\n\nUsha Vance's solo trip could have violated diplomatic protocol by sending a delegation to another country without an invitation. The amended plan — visiting a US base — avoided that potential violation. While Trump said that \"people from Greenland are asking us to go there,\" the government of Greenland said they had not invited any foreign delegations to visit.\n\n\"Just for the record, Naalakkersuisut, the government of Greenland, has not extended any invitations for any visits, neither private nor official,\" the government's official Facebook page wrote in a post on Monday.\n\nGreenland's then-prime minister, Múte Bourup Egede, also called Usha Vance's planned trip \"very aggressive\" in an interview with Sermitsiaq, a Greenlandic newspaper.\n\nTaylor Van Kirk, JD Vance's press secretary, told Business Insider at the time that the vice president and second lady were \"proud\" to visit the US military base in Greenland.\n\n\"As the vice president has said, previous US leaders have neglected Arctic security, while Greenland's Danish rulers have neglected their security obligations to the island. The security of Greenland is critical in ensuring the security of the rest of the world, and the Vice President looks forward to learning more about the island.\"\n\nWhile the US doesn't own Greenland, it has had a military presence there since World War II.\n\nPituffik Space Base, originally named Thule Air Base, was formally established in 1951 as part of a Cold War-era defense treaty between the US and Denmark. It is located in Pituffik, Greenland, 750 miles north of the Arctic Circle and halfway between New York and Moscow.\n\nAs a Danish territory, Greenland does not have a military of its own.\n\nAs the Pentagon's northernmost military base, Pituffik Space Base acts as a key Arctic defense outpost. Because of its location on the \"top of the world,\" it is an optimal vantage point for monitoring missile launches by US adversaries like Russia and establishing space superiority.\n\nThe base is the site of a phased-array radar, which can detect sea-launched and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and a surface-to-air missile system, which intercepts hostile threats.\n\nThe base has a Satellite Command and Control system to maintain real-time communications and data relay with military and intelligence satellites. Its high-altitude location also allows it to more frequently track polar-orbit satellites, which can monitor the entire Earth's surface over time as the planet rotates below them.\n\nBecause Pituffik's primary mission is space surveillance and missile warning, the space base doesn't house a permanently stationed fighter wing or naval fleet.\n\nInstead, it acts as a strategic logistics and defense hub for Arctic missions and under-ice operations. From the site, which is the world's northernmost deep-water seaport, surface vessels and submarines operated by the US Navy and allied forces conduct Arctic patrols and cold-weather training exercises.\n\nAircraft regularly fly in and out of the former air base, such as military cargo and refueling planes and maritime patrol aircraft. Occasionally, fighter jets and long-range bombers will fly to the base for Arctic deterrence deployments and training flights.\n\nWhile it doesn't have a permanent combat force, the Air Force does have one tugboat at Pituffik to support port operations, icebreaking, and maneuvering ships.\n\nA small but significant asset, the Rising Star helps keep supply routes open by breaking up and pushing floating ice. The tugboat guides supply ships through the port, making it a critical component in bringing fuel, food, and equipment to personnel year-round.\n\nHowever, since the base is locked in by ice for nine months of the year, the Rising Star gets limited use because it can only be operated when the port is completely ice-free.\n\nPituffik Space Base is surrounded by ice for nine months out of every year. The closest town, the Inuit village of Qaanaaq, is located 65 miles away.\n\nTemperatures can range from 60 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer, when there are 24 hours of daylight, to -50 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, when there is no sunlight for weeks.\n\nWinter storms are categorized into five levels from least to most severe: Normal, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, and Delta. At the Bravo level, the buddy system is implemented so that no one walks outside alone. Non-essential facilities close at the Charlie level, and personnel must shelter in place during Delta storms.\n\nAbout 150 personnel are stationed at Pituffik.\n\nThe Dundas Buffet Dining Hall on base serves three meals a day with payments accepted through a meal card.\n\nThe Base Exchange, also known as \"BX,\" sells groceries, toiletries, souvenirs, and other assorted goods. It also houses a barber shop.\n\nThere are no ATMs at Pituffik Space Base, but the Base Exchange accepts debit and credit cards as well as US dollars.\n\nPituffik Space Base features a bowling alley, a chapel, and a community center with a theater and craft room.\n\nThere's also a gymnasium and workout room stocked with weights and treadmills.\n\nPituffik Space Base's official Facebook page shows personnel participating in recreational events such as a Hawaiian-themed Arctic luau party, Greenlandic Heritage Week, and cross-country skiing.\n\nThe US built airbases and weather stations across the ice sheet during World War II as refueling stops on transatlantic flights and supply routes.\n\nTwo decommissioned airbases are now being used as civilian airports, and a third was abandoned after the war ended.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the US Air Force also built four stations on Greenland's coasts as part of a larger communication network of more than 60 radar installations to detect Soviet bombers. Most of the stations have since been deactivated, left to deteriorate atop Greenland's ice sheet.\n\nIn 2024, NASA scientists detected an underground base for a top-secret Cold War-era missile operation known as Camp Century. Now buried 100 feet under the ice, the abandoned network of subterranean tunnels once operated under the guise of an Arctic research facility before the US government declassified it in 1995.\n\nBut the abandoned military sites represent more than just relics of past global conflicts. Thousands of gallons of biological, chemical, and radioactive waste left behind on the bases pose a significant environmental threat, especially as the planet warms.\n\nThe US military failed to clean up decommissioned facilities like Camp Century, assuming the ice sheet would entomb the waste and infrastructure over the years.\n\nHowever, at the current melting rate of the Arctic, researchers estimate that the waste could resurface around 2100. The question remains as to who is responsible for cleaning up the waste from abandoned US military facilities scattered throughout Greenland.\n\nThe US has long pursued access to or control over Greenland due to its strategic and economic significance, dating back as early as the late 19th century.\n\nSince his return to the White House, Trump has continued to double down on his ambitions to secure the self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, saying he won't rule out military force or economic coercion to do so.\n\nThough the Danish government has remained steadfast in refusing the sale, Trump's so-called \"real estate deal\" has spotlighted Greenland's growing desire for independence from Denmark and disinterest in being owned by anybody, including the US.\n\n\"The time has come to stand together,\" Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said at a press conference on Tuesday, appearing with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. \"It has not been easy to stand up to completely unacceptable pressure from our closest allies for a lifetime. But there is much to suggest that the hardest part is still ahead of us.\"",

    "title": "Arms makers say that the fast-moving war in Ukraine is changing how they design and upgrade weapons",
    "description": "The fight in Ukraine changes so rapidly that weapons makers can't afford to constantly overhaul and redevelop whole systems.",
    "fullText": "Rapid changes on the battlefield in Ukraine are prompting Western weapons manufacturers to reassess how military technology is developed and upgraded.\n\nWith the fight evolving quickly, arms companies in Ukraine and Europe say that they can't afford to start from scratch and completely redesign entire systems each time conditions shift.\n\nInstead, companies making aerial drones and ground robots told Business Insider that their focus is now on creating weapons that can be upgraded by simply changing parts or software rather than overhauling the whole system.\n\nDesigns are modular, like Lego pieces, with parts being easily swapped out as new mission demands arise. Increasingly, companies are turning to software-first designs for more convenient upgrades.\n\nDefense technology has been moving in this direction, but revelations from Russia's war against Ukraine are injecting new urgency.\n\nPatrick Shepherd, the chief sales officer for Milrem Robotics, an Estonian company that makes autonomous uncrewed ground vehicles and has some in Ukraine, said that these changes are key to staying ahead, as they provide much faster adaptation than what \"traditional, monolithic designs\" permit.\n\nUkraine's soldiers say that battlefield tech can become out of date in weeks and months, with electronic warfare, new drone countermeasures, and new tactics blunting once-effective systems.\n\nAmong the companies involved in this evolving technology battle is DroneShield, an Australian company that develops counter-drone technology and operates across Europe. It has multimillion-dollar US military contracts and has multiple systems in Ukraine.\n\nMatt McCrann, CEO of DroneShield's US arm, said that the drone and counter-drone fight has sped up globally since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, cutting development cycles to weeks rather than months or years.\n\nThe only way to keep pace, he said, is to build \"systems that are not fixed, solving the problem of today, but ones that can address an issue today and adapt as needed.\"\n\nLithuanian drone company Granta Autonomy was one of the first companies to send drones to Ukraine. CEO Gediminas Guoba said the company needs to build systems that are not simply ready for this year or the next, but can be updated and upgraded for new operations even further into the future.\n\nThat means building systems that can be easily reworked. Anything else, he said, and \"we will lose the battle.\"\n\nMcCrann said the faster development cycle is why DroneShield has put greater emphasis on modular and adaptable designs.\n\nLikewise, Shepherd said that Milrem builds flexibility into its systems from the outset, allowing sensors, payloads, mission systems, and other components to be integrated, removed, or upgraded without redesigning the entire vehicle.\n\nAchi, the CEO of Ukraine's Ark Robotics, which makes autonomous robots used by nearly two dozen Ukrainian brigades, said the company focuses on making its platforms \"as cheap and as mass producible as possible.\" He spoke to Business Insider using a pseudonym as a security precaution.\n\n\"And then when we get this right, we can do surface-level customization,\" like adding armor or additional equipment. The base platform remains the same, letting the company scale production without driving up costs.\n\nLatvia-based Origin Robotics manufactures both drones and drone interceptors used by Ukrainian and NATO forces. Its CEO, Agris Kipurs, told BI that the company also prioritizes modular systems to adapt quickly to battlefield changes.\n\nModular designs aren't just for companies striving to keep their edge in a competitive industry. Warfighters need them too. Ukrainian soldiers have said they need flexible systems that can be easily modified at the front.\n\nOleksandr Yabchanka, the head of robotic systems for Ukraine's Da Vinci Wolves Battalion, previously told Business Insider that the ground robots his unit uses can be configured for different missions, be it evacuating wounded troops or attacking Russian positions. He said the robots work like Lego bricks.\n\nShepherd said that Milrem's robots follow the same logic, avoiding designs built around a single mission. They can be customized by soldiers for evacuation, explosive disposal, intelligence gathering, or weaponized roles.\n\nIn some cases, soldiers adapt systems in ways manufacturers did not anticipate.\n\nWestern companies say they are learning from those changes. McCrann said Ukraine has been technologically innovative \"because they have to be,\" and that this is driving industry adaptation.\n\nCompanies sometimes have group chats and FaceTime calls with Ukrainian soldiers to get real-time feedback, and weapons software is where they can make the biggest changes the fastest.\n\nShepherd said that software is now playing a central role in adapting systems, whether for command-and-control integration or mission management. \"Software updates can be developed, tested, and deployed much more quickly, allowing lessons learned from the field to be integrated on shorter timescales,\" he said.\n\nMcCrann said DroneShield has focused on a software-first approach, where upgrades add new capabilities without hardware modifications.\n\nGuoba said Granta Autonomy's drones have not changed much over the last year or two, but the software inside them, on the other hand, \"is changing every month.\"\n\nSoftware can be remotely pushed to weaponry already in Ukraine, eliminating the need to ship gear back to the factory. That speed, and the ability to test changes quickly, has made software the preferred tool for rapid adaptation.\n\nUltimately, Ark Robotics' Achi said, \"software is easier to do.\"\n\nArk's aerial drones and ground robots rely on onboard and server-based software, and the company is developing systems to allow thousands of platforms to operate together with minimal human involvement.\n\nHe said Ark also deploys engineers forward to implement software changes tailored to specific units or missions. It follows a similar approach for hardware, though those changes take longer to implement.\n\nKipurs said Origin makes its systems \"software-intensive\" so development is continuous, \"with updates regularly pushed to improve systems that have already been delivered.\"\n\nIt only uses hardware changes \"when they provide clear benefits across all intended users.\" Because the company also builds for NATO customers, systems must remain broadly interoperable.\n\nShepherd said companies still need to strike a balance. Systems must remain reliable, so not every update can be rushed to the field. The key, he said, is close collaboration with Ukrainian soldiers and fast but disciplined feedback loops.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is pointing the finger at an unlikely target after his much-touted efforts to broker an end to the war in Ukraine failed to gain traction.\n\nAsked why U.S.-led peace talks have stalled, Trump blamed the victim of the invasion, claiming it was the Ukrainian leader’s fault. Asked directly what was standing in the way, he gave a one-word answer to Reuters: “Zelensky.”\n\nAt the same time, Trump argued that Moscow is prepared to conclude the conflict, saying Russian President Vladimir Putin is eager to bring the nearly four-year invasion to a close. “I think he’s ready to make a deal,” Trump said, adding, “I think Ukraine is less ready to make a deal.”\n\nOn Thursday, the Kremlin said they agree with Trump’s remarks, which are in contrast to those of European allies, who have long maintained that Moscow is not genuinely interested in ending the conflict, instead aiming to seize additional territory while avoiding new Western sanctions.\n\nTrump, who previously said he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine “in a day” if he won a second term, has frequently clashed with Zelensky over the past year.\n\nNegotiations took a sharp turn in March last year when a public clash between Trump and Zelensky in the Oval Office derailed a widely promoted agreement that would have given the U.S. access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, with the Ukrainian president leaving the White House without signing the deal. In the aftermath, Trump briefly halted military assistance and intelligence sharing, though both were restored the following month.\n\nSince then, the interactions between the two presidents have improved, with Ukrainian officials being deeply involved in recent peace talks, led by the U.S.\n\nRecent U.S.-led diplomacy has focused on what security guarantees Ukraine would receive after a ceasefire to prevent another Russian attack. As part of those discussions, American negotiators have broadly urged Kyiv to consider relinquishing control of the eastern Donbas region in exchange for an agreement with Russia.\n\nZelensky, however, has repeatedly rejected any suggestion of territorial concessions, insisting Ukraine’s constitution bars the government from surrendering any of its land to Moscow.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian forces have continued to press their offensive in Ukraine despite Trump’s claims that his pressure campaign and peace efforts are gaining traction with the Kremlin.\n\nIn mid-January, Moscow confirmed the launch of a hypersonic Oreshnik missile into western Ukraine near the EU border, a high-speed strike that hit infrastructure in the Lviv region. Western officials condemned it as an escalation even as peace proposals were being discussed.\n\nAt the same time, Russia has repeatedly carried out large waves of missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure while diplomatic talks have continued. In December, Ukrainian authorities reported hundreds of drones and missiles targeting power stations and other sites across the country, causing multiple injuries and widespread damage even as discussions on ending the war persisted.\n\nMoscow’s foreign ministry has also signaled reluctance to accept partial ceasefires as credible.\n\nIn his New Year’s message, Zelensky warned that Moscow was deliberately continuing its war, saying that “Russia deliberately brings war” with night time shelling and large drone attacks, and thanked Ukrainian defenders for repelling many of them.\n\nWhen asked why he believes Zelensky has resisted moving forward with peace talks, Trump told Reuters: “I just think he’s, you know, having a hard time getting there.”",

    "description": "Military veterans aged 65 face being mobilised under new powers to prepare the Armed Forces for war.",
    "fullText": "Military veterans aged 65 face being mobilised under new powers to prepare the Armed Forces for war.\n\nThe Government is set to increase the age at which the nation’s pool of retired soldiers, known as the strategic reserve, can be called upon from 55 to 65.\n\nThe new measures are being introduced as part of a new Armed Forces bill, which will be published in Parliament later.\n\nThe changes will make it easier to mobilise tens of thousands of former military personnel.\n\nThe Army has shrunk to its smallest number in more than 200 years, with just over 70,000 full-time, fully-trained troops ready to deploy to the frontline.\n\nUnder existing rules, the pool of retired soldiers can be called upon in the event of “national danger, great emergency or attack in the UK”.\n\nHowever, under the new changes, this will be lowered to “warlike preparations”, which is already the threshold for reservists who have recently left the Armed Forces.\n\nThe measures come amid fears Britain could be dragged into a full-scale war with Russia in a matter of years.\n\nDefence and security chiefs have repeatedly warned of the potential for large-scale war in recent months.\n\nAl Carns, the Armed Forces minister, said just before Christmas that war was “already knocking on Europe’s door” and that Britain had to be prepared for a conflict that was “bigger” than those fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nLast week, the UK announced it would be deploying troops to Ukraine, alongside France, if and when a ceasefire deal between Moscow and Kyiv is agreed.\n\nWhile it is unclear exactly how many troops could be involved, reports have suggested up to 7,500 UK personnel could be deployed.\n\nIf this figure is accurate, it would effectively mean that around 21,000 personnel would be committed to Ukraine – with one cohort deployed, another in training and a third recovering for operations there.\n\nHowever, military analysts have warned such a deployment would stretch the Armed Forces and would effectively become an “all of Army effort” to maintain.\n\nSources at the Ministry of Defence have pushed back against suggestions that 7,500 troops could be deployed, with insiders saying it could be lower.\n\nOn Friday, the Government pledged to spend £200m to upgrade armoured vehicles and buy new kit in preparation for the peacekeeping mission.\n\nThe proposed changes would come into force next year if approved by Parliament, the BBC reported.\n\nThe Government estimates there are around 95,000 people within the strategic reserve, including veterans from the Royal Navy, Army, and RAF.\n\nThese are different to the reserve forces, which comprise personnel who volunteer part-time to serve in the military. Currently, there are almost 32,000 activist reservists across the three wings of the Armed Forces.\n\nThe military has struggled to recruit and retain personnel in recent years. The Army has suffered the most, having shrunk from more than 100,000 personnel in 2010 to just over 70,000 now.\n\nThe most recent figures show a very marginal increase in the number of people joining the military. But it is still at its lowest ebb since the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nMeanwhile, the Armed Forces is grappling with a £28 billion funding black hole over the next four years despite plans to boost defence spending.\n\nSir Keir Starmer was warned about the shortfall by the head of the military, Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Knighton, a few days before Christmas.\n\nOn Monday, Sir Richard admitted Britain did not have the cash to deliver its military ambitions, which were set out by the PM in June as part of the Strategic Defence Review.\n\nThe Chief of the Defence Staff told MPs on the Commons defence committee: “I’ll be completely honest with you – we will not be able to do everything that we would wish to do as quickly as we might want to do it.\n\n“If we wanted to do everything that’s currently in the programme and do all the extra things in the SDR [strategic defence review], could we do that with the budget that we have got? The answer’s no.”\n\nThis is despite Sir Keir having announced last year that defence spending would rise from 2.3 per cent of GDP to 2.6 per cent by 2027. Looser pledges were also made in the strategic defence review to hit 3 per cent in the early 2030s and 3.5 per cent by 2035.\n\nAs part of the Strategic Defence Review, Sir Keir vowed to build 12 new nuclear attack submarines and spend billions more on new defence technology.\n\nBritain’s military spending is the subject of increasing criticism, with a parliamentary report last year warning the country was not ready to defend itself against attack.\n\nEarlier this month, the UK fell down the global defence spending rankings, and is now Nato’s 12th-biggest spender in terms of GDP compared with third in 2021.\n\nNews of the latest shortfall is said to have prompted Sir Keir to order a key MoD document, the defence investment plan, to be overhauled.\n\nThe Defence Investment Plan, which will set out how the Government’s long-term defence plans will be paid for, was originally due to be published in the autumn. However, it now appears to be stuck in financial purgatory, with Sir Richard telling MPs the MoD “do not have a date” for when it will be released.\n\nIt prompted concerns that the Armed Forces could soon be forced to make sweeping cuts to balance the books.",

The former head of Ukraine’s digital transformation policies is credited with spearheading the the army's drone technology and introducing several successful e-government platforms.\n\nHis appointment was part of a broad government reshuffle that the Ukrainian leader said aimed to sharpen the focus on security, defense development and diplomacy amid a new U.S.-led push to find a peace settlement.\n\nFedorov said the defense ministry is facing a shortfall of 300 billion hryvnia ($6.9 billion) in funding needs.\n\nThe European Union will dedicate most of a massive new loan program to help fund Ukraine’s military and economy over the next two years, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday.\n\nFedorov said Ukraine’s defense sector has expanded significantly since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. At the start of the war, he said, the country had seven private drone companies and two firms developing electronic warfare systems. Today, he said, there are nearly 500 drone manufacturers and about 200 electronic warfare companies in Ukraine.\n\nHe added that some sectors have emerged from scratch, including private missile producers, which now number about 20, and more than 100 companies manufacturing ground-based robotic systems.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "Military history is filled with sleek fighters, massive tanks, and iconic weapons, but scattered among them are machines so bizarre they look like they were designed during a fever dream after binge-watching too many sci-fi movies. Some were prototypes that never made it past testing but still flew, rolled, or fired in real life, proving that just because you can build something doesn't mean you should.\n\nOthers were actually put into full service, where their strange shapes and awkward designs became unlikely heroes of war. These weren't the most polished, but rather eccentric solutions born of necessity, wild ambition, or the kind of desperation that makes you think \"what if we just duct-tape a howitzer to this truck chassis?\"\n\nFrom tanks that resembled mobile barns to flying boats that seemed half-alien, each one demonstrates how engineers sometimes disregard physics textbooks to see what happens.\n\nWe didn’t simply pick vehicles that looked odd (although that's quite fascinating in its own right). Our ranking was based on three factors:\n\nHow unusual their concept or design was\n\nWhether they worked in practice\n\nTo capture the full spectrum of strangeness, we split the list into two parts. The first half covers vehicles that were experimental or never saw true combat, but were still real machines that left the drawing board and proved themselves in tests. The second half highlights the bizarre vehicles that actually went into service or saw combat, showing that weirdness didn’t stop at the prototype stage.\n\nOur goal wasn’t to judge them on technical specs or battlefield performance, but on how boldly and bizarrely they challenged conventional design. In the end, each machine earned its spot by being both strange and real, either as a functioning oddity or as a combat-tested curiosity.\n\nNot every wild idea made it to the battlefield, but that didn't stop engineers from building and testing them anyway. These machines were strange, ambitious, and often about as practical as a screen door on a submarine; yet they were real, and they proved that even the craziest concepts could take shape in steel and wings.\n\nSpecs: 183 mm L4A1 gun, Centurion-based chassis, about 50.8 tonnes combat weight; very tall, lightly armored turret\n\nAt first glance, the FV4005 Stage II looked like someone had welded a garden shed onto a tank chassis and declared it battle-ready. This wasn't subtle engineering: this was the British saying, \"if bigger guns win wars, let's build the biggest bloody gun we can fit on tracks.\"\n\nThe turret was so absurdly tall and thin that crews nicknamed it \"The Barn,\" and honestly, most barns probably had better structural integrity. The tank was so top-heavy that firing the main gun required lowering a rear recoil spade into the ground, essentially turning it into a temporary artillery piece.In trials, recoil could noticeably lift the front of the vehicle (reported on the order of a few dozen centimeters at some elevations); which is either impressive engineering or a fantastic way to launch your tank crew into orbit. Maybe both.\n\nThe 183mm gun could theoretically penetrate any Soviet armor at ridiculous ranges, but good luck getting there without tipping over. Tank crews took one look at this mechanical giraffe and probably started updating their wills. Though it never entered service, it remains a favorite among tank enthusiasts who appreciate the pure audacity of strapping a ship's cannon to a tank and hoping for the best.\n\nSpecs: Allison YT40-A-14 turboprop, 5,850 hp, a tailsitter VTOL concept (intended to take off and land vertically, but it never demonstrated operational vertical takeoffs/landings in testing), maximum pucker factor\n\nThe Lockheed XFV was probably the result of someone asking, \"What if we made a plane that lands like a rocket?\" and nobody had the sense to say, \"That sounds terrible.\" This tail-sitting fighter looked like a conventional plane that had been stood on its tail by a very confused ground crew.\n\nThe idea was brilliant in theory: vertical takeoff meant no runways were needed, making it perfect for carriers or forward bases. In practice, it meant asking test pilots to land while looking over their shoulder at the ground rushing up to meet them. The landing gear looked like something stolen from a NASA launch pad, because conventional gear would have snapped like toothpicks.\n\nTest pilot Herman \"Fish\" Salmon (yes, that was his real name) described flying it as \"interesting,\" which in test pilot speak translates to \"holy heck, I can't believe I survived that.\" The XFV flew conventionally using temporary landing gear and conducted limited testing related to the VTOL concept, but it did not prove routine vertical takeoff-and-landing operations, and likely give any pilot who flew it nightmares for weeks.\n\nThe program was scrapped when everyone realized that asking pilots to thread the needle of a vertical landing while enemy fire was incoming might not be the best career move. The XFV proved that sometimes the laws of physics and human psychology should take precedence over engineering ambition.\n\nSpecs: Two Soloviev D-30 turbofans, inflatable pontoons, maximum weirdness coefficient achieved\n\nThe VVA-14 looked like what you'd get if a submarine, a seaplane, and a hovercraft had a three-way collision and decided to make the best of it. Soviet engineers were tasked with building an anti-submarine aircraft that could operate from water, and apparently decided that conventional design principles were for capitalists.\n\nThis flying doorstop featured inflatable pontoons that resembled giant water wings, stubby wings that seemed too small to keep a paper airplane aloft, and a fuselage that appeared to have been designed with a ruler and little imagination. The whole thing looked as if it were perpetually surprised to be airborne.\n\nThe VVA-14 was supposed to hunt NATO submarines using ground effect, basically flying so close to the water that it could barely clear the waves. Watching it take off was like seeing a concrete mixer attempt flight. Soviet test crews reported it handled \"adequately,\" which is probably the most damning praise ever recorded in aviation history.\n\nDespite looking like a flying mistake, it actually worked. The program stalled largely because the intended lift-engine set (for VTOL/ground-effect ambitions) was never delivered, and after Bartini’s death the project lost momentum. The VVA-14 remains proof that Soviet engineers could make literally anything fly if they were given enough vodka and state funding.\n\nSpecs: Standard Meteor F8 airframe, pilot lying face-down, ergonomics designed by sadists\n\nSomeone at Gloster Aircraft looked at the perfectly functional Meteor fighter and thought, \"You know what this needs? The pilot should be lying on their stomach like they're getting a massage.\" The theory was that prone positioning would help pilots better handle high G-forces. The reality was more like asking fighter pilots to dogfight while planking.\n\nThe modified cockpit looked like a medieval torture device with windows. Test pilots had to operate all controls while lying flat, which meant reaching forward for everything and craning their necks to see where they were going. Photos of the test setup resemble someone trying to cram a grown man into a torpedo tube.\n\nRAF test pilot Eric George Franklin flew the prone-pilot Meteor during evaluation flights; the concept proved impractical for operational use. Coming from a guy who test-flew captured German jets and lived to tell about it, that's practically a death sentence for any aircraft design.\n\nThe program was quickly abandoned when everyone realized that asking pilots to fly combat missions while doing permanent push-ups wasn't exactly conducive to air superiority. The Prone Pilot Meteor remains a testament to the fact that just because you can redesign something doesn't mean you should.\n\nSpecs: Forward-swept wings, fly-by-wire flight controls, maximum instability by design\n\nThe X-29 resembled a fighter jet assembled from a kit without consulting the instructions first. Its forward-swept wings made it appear to be flying backwards even when sitting still, defying every basic principle of aircraft design that had worked perfectly well since the Wright Brothers.\n\nThis wasn't an accident, the forward-swept design was intentional, designed to improve maneuverability and reduce drag. The problem was that forward-swept wings want to twist themselves off the aircraft at high speeds, which is generally considered poor form in aviation circles. The X-29 used a triply redundant digital fly-by-wire flight-control system (with additional backup), because the airframe was intentionally unstable to operate constantly, just to prevent it from tearing itself apart in flight.\n\nNASA test pilots reported that the X-29 was incredibly agile but required the reflexes of a caffeinated mongoose to fly safely. The computer systems made about 40 flight-control corrections per second, because apparently the X-29's natural inclination was to immediately flip upside down and head for the nearest patch of ground.\n\nDespite looking completely wrong, the X-29 proved several important points about advanced aerodynamics and flight control systems. It also proved that American engineers could make anything fly if they were given enough computers and test pilots with nerves of steel.\n\nSome bizarre vehicles didn't stay as experiments: they actually rolled, floated, or flew into service. Awkward, odd, or downright laughable, these machines still managed to make their mark in real battles and operations, proving that sometimes weird just works.\n\nSpecs: 800mm gun, 1,350-ton weight, required an enormous support effort, on the order of thousands for transport, assembly, security, and rail work, while the firing crew itself was far smaller (often cited around 500), subtlety rating: zero\n\nThe Schwerer Gustav is what happened when German engineers were asked to build the biggest possible gun and forgot to ask, \"Why?\" or \"Is this necessary?\" This railway cannon was so absurdly oversized that it looked like someone had confused the blueprints for a battleship turret with those for a mobile artillery piece.\n\nEach shell weighed as much as a small car and could designed for extreme bunker-busting, often described in terms of several meters of reinforced concrete or around a meter of armor plate, depending on the shell. The gun itself required its own railway infrastructure, complete with curved tracks to handle the recoil. Moving Gustav required a logistics operation that would make Amazon's shipping department envious.\n\nThe entire setup looked like a mobile steel mountain. German artillery crews likely felt as though they were operating a mechanical volcano rather than a weapon. Gustav fired 47 rounds during the Sevastopol siege, where each shot cost roughly as much as a small fighter aircraft.\n\nDespite its impracticality, Gustav did exactly what it was designed to do: it obliterated anything it aimed at with the subtlety of a nuclear weapon and twice the engineering complexity. It remains the largest gun ever used in combat and possibly the most expensive way to deliver explosives ever invented.\n\nNecessary? I guess not. Worth it? Yes.\n\nSpecs: 6x6 amphibious capability, 2.5-ton payload, looked ridiculous, worked perfectly\n\nThe DUKW (pronounced \"Duck\") looked like what would happen if a truck and a boat had an awkward one-night stand and decided to make it work for the kids. This amphibious vehicle was essentially a standard GMC truck that had been taught to swim, with results that were both ungainly and brilliant.\n\nOn land, it looked like a boat with delusions of grandeur. In water, it looked like a truck having an identity crisis. The DUKW could carry supplies from ship to shore without needing docks, piers, or any infrastructure beyond a beach capable of supporting its weight.\n\nMilitary mechanics quickly learned to appreciate the Duck despite its unusual appearance. It could haul ammunition across rivers, deliver supplies to isolated units, and even serve as an impromptu ferry for troops. The DUKW became the Swiss Army knife of amphibious warfare, ugly, versatile, and absolutely indispensable.\n\nFrom Normandy beaches to Pacific atolls, the Duck waddled its way through every major amphibious operation of WWII. Soldiers might have laughed at it initially, but they learned to appreciate anything that could bring hot food and dry ammunition to the front lines. The DUKW proved that sometimes the best military vehicles are those that appear to have been designed by committee and built by optimists.\n\nSpecs: Half motorcycle, half tank, all weird, Opel 4-cylinder engine producing about 36 hp (26 kW), maximum confusion factor\n\nThe Kettenkrad resembled someone who had started building a motorcycle and, halfway through, decided it needed tank tracks instead of a rear wheel. German engineers deliberately created this mechanical centaur to handle terrain that would stop both motorcycles and tanks.\n\nWith handlebars like a Harley and tracks like a Panzer, the Kettenkrad could tow anti-tank guns through mud that would swallow a truck whole. German troops quickly discovered it could go places that wheeled vehicles couldn't reach and fit through spaces too small for tracked vehicles.\n\nThe steering system was a pure example of German engineering logic: the front wheel steered like a normal motorcycle at low speeds, but at higher speeds, differential braking on the tracks took over. This meant learning to drive one was like learning two completely different vehicles, depending on how fast you were going.\n\nDespite its odd appearance, Wehrmacht units loved the Kettenkrad. It could lay communication cables across rough terrain, tow equipment through forests, and even serve as a mobile command post for forward observers. German mechanics appreciated that it was reliable, serviceable, and could be repaired with standard motorcycle and tank parts.\n\nThe Kettenkrad remained in production throughout the war and was utilized in every theater where German forces were deployed. It proved that sometimes the best solution to a complex problem is to combine two working designs until something useful emerges.\n\nSpecs: Standard lorry chassis, roughly 6 inches (about 150 mm) of concrete armor (typically with reinforcement), mobility rating: \"eventually\"\n\nThe Bison wasn't sophisticated military engineering: it was what happened when Britain faced invasion and someone said, \"Let's pour concrete on trucks and see what happens.\" Built during the darkest days of 1940, these improvised armored vehicles were essentially mobile pillboxes for the Home Guard.\n\nThe concept was brilliantly simple: take a standard truck, build wooden forms around it, pour in concrete mixed with steel reinforcement, and voila, instant armored vehicle! The results looked like construction equipment that had gotten lost on the way to a building site and decided to join the army instead.\n\nThese concrete-clad lorries were slow, heavy, and about as maneuverable as their name suggests. British crews joked that the Bison could stop rifle bullets but not much else... Including hills, mud, or sharp turns. The weight of the concrete armor stressed every component of the truck chassis beyond its design limits.\n\nDespite their limitations, Bisons were deployed to guard airfields, coastal installations, and key infrastructure across Britain. Home Guard units appreciated having something that offered protection from small arms fire, even if it looked like a cement mixer with delusions of grandeur.\n\nThe Bison represented the spirit of British improvisation during WWII: it wasn't elegant, it wasn't sophisticated, but it was available, and it could stop a bullet.\n\nSpecs: Ground effect vehicle, 8 Kuznetsov NK-87 turbofans, about 340 mph (≈550 km/h) maximum cruising speed for the Lun-class, physics-defying capabilities\n\nThe ekranoplane resembled what would happen if a jumbo jet and a naval destroyer had a baby and were raised on a steady diet of rocket fuel and Soviet ambition. This ground-effect vehicle was designed to skim just above the water's surface at incredible speeds, utilizing aerodynamic principles that most Western engineers considered theoretically interesting but practically insane.\n\nThe Lun-class was essentially a flying missile boat, equipped with six Moskit anti-ship missiles and enough turbofan engines to power a small airline. It could cruise at 380 mph just 10 feet above the waves, making it nearly impossible to detect on radar until it was too late.\n\nSoviet naval aviation crews described flying the ekranoplane as surreal, traveling at jet speeds while close enough to the water to see fish swimming below. The ground effect allowed it to carry massive payloads that would be impossible for conventional aircraft, but required perfect weather conditions and calm seas to operate safely.\n\nWestern intelligence agencies were baffled by early satellite photos of the ekranoplane. It was too big to be a conventional aircraft but clearly capable of flight, leading to speculation about everything from captured alien technology to secret nuclear programs. The reality was somehow even stranger than the rumors.\n\nThe Lun entered limited service with the Soviet Navy in the late 1980s but proved too specialized for practical deployment. It required specially trained crews, perfect weather conditions, and extensive support infrastructure. The project was abandoned after the Soviet Union collapsed, leaving the remaining ekranoplanes as monuments to the fact that Soviet engineers could make anything fly if you gave them enough engines and a creative interpretation of physics.\n\nSpecs: 45 tons, 5 turrets, ypically a 10-man crew (some sources cite higher numbers depending on variant or counting attached personnel), maximum chaos potential\n\nThe T-35 was the result of Soviet tank designers being asked to build a heavy tank, and they decided that if one turret was good, five turrets must be five times better. This mechanical monster bristled with weapons in every direction, looking like someone had taken a naval destroyer and taught it to drive on land.\n\nWith one main turret mounting a 76mm gun and four smaller turrets sporting 45mm guns and machine guns, the T-35 could theoretically engage multiple targets simultaneously. In practice, coordinating fire from five different turrets while moving across rough terrain proved about as practical as conducting an orchestra during an earthquake.\n\nThe T-35 was a crowd-pleaser at Red Square parades, where its imposing size and multiple turrets made it look unstoppable. Soviet propaganda films loved showing these mechanical fortresses rolling past the Kremlin, symbolizing the industrial might of the socialist state.\n\nCombat proved less impressive than parades. Several T-35s were deployed during the German invasion of 1941, where they were eventually knocked out or abandoned due to mechanical failures. Crews who operated them reported that coordinating five different weapons systems while under fire required skills that no amount of training could provide.\n\nThe T-35's greatest weakness wasn't enemy fire... It was its own complexity. With 11 crew members spread across five turrets, communication became a nightmare during combat. The tank was also mechanically unreliable, with a transmission that regularly failed under the strain of moving 45 tons of steel across rough terrain.\n\nDespite its poor combat record, the T-35 remains unforgettable for its sheer audacity. Soviet tank designers took the concept of \"more is better\" to its logical extreme, creating something that looked like it could conquer Europe single-handedly. The reality was more mundane, but the T-35's unique silhouette earned it a permanent place in military history.\n\nFrom prototypes that resembled designs by aliens to combat vehicles that actually made it to the battlefield despite appearing completely wrong, these machines remind us that military engineering has always walked the fine line between genius and madness.\n\nEngineers were often tasked with solving seemingly impossible problems with limited resources and boundless imagination. Sometimes the answers came in shapes that defied common sense and challenged every design principle ever written. The results were vehicles that might not have been beautiful, practical, or even particularly effective, but they worked well enough to earn their place in history.\n\nWhat unites all these mechanical oddities is their willingness to challenge convention. These weren't incremental improvements on existing designs, they were bold leaps into uncharted territory, powered by caffeine, determination, and the kind of engineering confidence that comes from never having been told something is impossible.\n\nSome never went beyond testing, while others waddled, crawled, or flew their way into real combat. However, they all demonstrate that the line between brilliant innovation and spectacular failure is often thinner than the blueprints on which they were drawn. And sometimes, the weirdest ideas are the ones that teach us the most about what's actually possible when you stop worrying about what things are supposed to look like.",

U.S. deputy ambassador to the United Nations Tammy Bruce singled out Russia’s launch of a nuclear-capable Oreshnik ballistic missile last week close to Ukraine’s border with Poland, a NATO ally.",
    "fullText": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States accused Russia on Monday of a “dangerous and inexplicable escalation” of its nearly four-year war in Ukraine at a time when the Trump administration is trying to advance negotiations toward peace.\n\nU.S. deputy ambassador to the United Nations Tammy Bruce singled out Russia’s launch of a nuclear-capable Oreshnik ballistic missile last week close to Ukraine’s border with Poland, a NATO ally.\n\nShe told an emergency meeting of the Security Council that the United States deplores “the staggering number of casualties” in the conflict and condemns Russia’s intensifying attacks on energy and other infrastructure.\n\nUkraine called for the meeting after last Thursday’s overnight Russian bombardment with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles, including the powerful, new hypersonic Oreshnik missile, which Moscow used for only the second time in what was a clear warning to Kyiv’s NATO allies.\n\nThe large-scale attack came days after Ukraine and its allies reported major progress toward agreeing on how to defend the country from further Moscow aggression if a U.S.-led peace deal is struck.\n\nThe attack also coincided with a new chill in relations between Moscow and Washington after Russia condemned the U.S. seizure of an oil tanker in the North Atlantic. And it came as U.S. President Donald Trump signaled he is on board with a hard-hitting sanctions package meant to economically cripple Russia.\n\nMoscow has given no public signal it is willing to budge from its maximalist demands on Ukraine. And Russia's U.N. ambassador on Monday blamed the diplomatic impasse on Ukraine.\n\nEurope’s leaders condemned the attack using the Oreshnik as “escalatory and unacceptable,” and U.S. envoy Bruce was equally tough on Monday.\n\n“At a moment of tremendous potential, due only to President Trump’s unparalleled commitment to peace around the world, both sides should be seeking ways to de-escalate,” she said. “Yet Russia’s action risks expanding and intensifying the war.”\n\nBruce reminded Russia that nearly a year ago it voted in favor of a Security Council resolution calling for an end to the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n“It would be nice if Russia matched their words with deeds,” she said. “In the spirit of that resolution, Russia, Ukraine and Europe must pursue peace seriously and bring this nightmare to an end.”\n\nBut Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council that until Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “comes to his senses and agrees to realistic conditions for negotiations, we will continue solving the problem by military means.”\n\n“He was warned long ago, with each passing day, each day which he squanders, the conditions for negotiations will only get worse for him,” Nebenzia said. “Similarly, each vile attack on Russian civilians will elicit a stiff response.”\n\nUkraine’s U.N. Ambassador Andriy Melnyk countered that Russia is more vulnerable now than at any time since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Its economy is slowing and oil revenue is down.\n\n“Russia wants to sell to this council and the whole U.N. family the impression that it is invincible, but this is another illusion,” he told the council. “The carefully staged image of strength is nothing but smoke and mirrors, completely detached from reality.”",

    "fullText": "The war in Ukraine is one of blast and shrapnel injuries, not gunshot wounds, a local medic and US veterans providing medical care in front-line areas told Business Insider.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine is characterized by fighting in extensive trench networks, where grenades continue to prove their worth, intense artillery fire, missile barrages, and drone attacks. Land mines also continue to be a problem.\n\nGunfights, however, are becoming less common.\n\nUS veterans and a Ukrainian medic told Business Insider that most combat injuries are caused by fragmentation and burns and that amputations are often necessary.\n\nThese injuries are not unusual for industrial, artillery-heavy conflicts, or more modern kinds of warfare, for that matter, but they are being exacerbated by new technology, such as exploding one-way attack drones and others that drop grenades and other deadly explosives.\n\n\"This is not a war of direct small-arms contact,\" the medic shared, \"but a war of remote destruction.\"\n\nKaterina Zirka, the Ukrainian combat medic, said that she increasingly sees injuries that affect multiple parts of the body at once, often without a single identifiable \"entry wound,\" but instead dozens of micro-injuries from blasts and shrapnel. The medical equipment she carries has changed as a result.\n\nMedics are also seeing internal blast injuries that don't come with external wounds, such as concussions, ruptured eardrums, and lung injuries from rapid changes in pressure, she said.\n\nSoldiers fighting in Ukraine have told Business Insider about being injured by exploding drones, mines, and falling debris when buildings are hit. Mortars, artillery, and rockets have also done their fair share of damage.\n\nA US veteran who fought in Ukraine and served as a combat medic for his unit previously told Business Insider that he saw a significant number of injuries from explosions, like burns, concussions, traumatic brain injuries, and wounds from shrapnel that resulted in amputations.\n\n\"Artillery is fucking everywhere out there. You go anywhere near the front, it's just artillery shell, artillery shell, artillery artillery,\" he said, speaking to BI on the condition of anonymity for operational security reasons.\n\nThe threats, however, are far more than artillery.\n\nJeffrey Wells, a US Navy veteran with experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, is involved in medical training for front-line Ukrainian civilians through a nonprofit organization, Task Force Antal, that also provides supplies and evacuation assistance. He shared details about the kinds of injuries he's seen in this role.\n\n\"Mostly people aren't being shot, even on the front lines,\" he explained. \"It's injuries that come from a missile, a drone, or a glide bomb.\"\n\nMark Antal, the co-founder of Task Force Antal and a veteran of the elite US special operations unit Delta Force, told Business Insider that he had to tell some of his group's medics that \"the soldiers on the front line, less than 2% of them are being shot. All of the wounds are from drones, from shrapnel.\"\n\nAnd with civilians, \"it's crush injuries, it's blast injuries.\"\n\nChristine Quinn Antal, a US Army veteran and former national security advisor who co-founded the nonprofit, said that with other injuries being significantly more prevalent, members have taken \"things like chest seals,\" tools used for gunshot wounds, out of their medical kits. \"We've moved away from that,\" she said.\n\nAway from the cities, out on the front lines, drones dominate warfare, but even in the close-quarters fighting, explosives, not necessarily guns, are key. There is still a role for guns in this war, but drones and other new tech are taking over classic combat roles, even the precision strike role of snipers.\n\nDrones are used in this war more than in any other conflict in history, and have fundamentally changed the shape of the war. Their ubiquity is shown by Ukraine's own stats. Its commander in chief said in November that drones were responsible for around 60% of all Russian targets hit.\n\nDrones direct traditional weapons but also engage targets as well. They are deadly tools readily available in large quantities at low costs, making them increasingly desirable tools as the war drags on.\n\nZirka said that injuries have changed because now, \"most engagements actually take place in the air through the use of drones. As a result, gunshot wounds are encountered much less frequently.\" Soldiers have told BI that drones have created a roughly 10-kilometer kill zone at the front.\n\nGuns are not gone from Ukraine, far from it, but it is a different kind of fighting. Soldiers carry and are trained on various guns for different missions, some of which sometimes actually lead to injuries that aren't gunshots.\n\nSoldiers often arm themselves against the ever-present threat of drones with electronic warfare tools and shotguns, among other systems. Shooting down drones, like the fiber-optic drones resistant to jamming, can generate dangerous shrapnel that can pierce or shred the skin.\n\nTroops also carry guns into trench warfare, which has been a prominent part of this fight.\n\nBut much of that fight also relies on other weapons, such as explosives like grenades and mines. These weapons are used to booby trap trenches and to try to clear them. The trenches can be so tight that it can make using firearms like assault rifles difficult.\n\nDrones are also used in trench battles, including by dropping grenades into enemy trenches or diving down on soldiers and exploding.\n\nLikewise, explosives are often used to clear bunkers as well. Charging into one for an extremely close-quarters firefight is exceptionally dangerous. A grenade, on the other hand, lowers the risk.\n\nUkraine has mounted machine guns and other weapons on its uncrewed ground robots, creating new ways to fire on the Russians using guns without putting its troops at risk, but these weapons are still quite limited for the time being. The same is true for the automated gun turrets.\n\nAs Zirka indicated, this war is more of a remote-explosive fight than a gunfight.",

    "fullText": "A picture is worth a thousand words. A video makes a statement.\n\nFacing down the threat of a potential criminal indictment, Fed Chair Jerome Powell didn't write a press release.\n\nInstead, he turned to the camera, literally, to respond to what he described as the Trump administration's \"threats and ongoing pressure.\"\n\nThe choice was out of character for Powell, who's known for measured, not reactionary, responses during his Fed tenure. But the video enabled Powell to project calm while also signaling the significance of the moment, communication and leadership experts told BI's Ana Altcheck and Tim Paradis.\n\n(If you need a refresher, here's the backstory on Powell's Senate testimony that's the basis for the DOJ probe.)\n\nPowell's response is worth examining as President Donald Trump continues to pick fights across the business world. Look no further than the oil industry, where Trump said he's \"inclined\" to keep ExxonMobil out of Venezuela after its CEO said the country is currently \"uninvestable.\"\n\nIt's a strategy we've seen before from Trump.\n\n\"Trump will say he wants or needs something to happen, often using fantastical logic to justify it — and then uses coercion to try to make it happen,\" writes BI's Peter Kafka.\n\nIt's also part of a new form of capitalism that Trump is ushering in, including the government sometimes taking stakes in individual companies and leaning on public offices meant to remain independent. We're following it all this year with our series on \"The Future of Capitalism.\"\n\nEven if Trump wins the battle with Powell, he could still lose the war on rate cuts\n\nHeading into the year, investors expected two standard cuts from the central bank in 2026. Now JPMorgan is questioning if we'll even get one.\n\nStrong job and GDP growth, coupled with inflation sitting above 3%, has JPMorgan predicting the Fed will hold rates steady for the entire year. And that's even if Trump installs a Fed chair who's more keen to cut rates.\n\n\"Against this anticipated macro backdrop, we do not see the new dovish Fed chair being able to sway the FOMC to cut,\" wrote Michael Feroli, JPMorgan's chief US economist.\n\nAs if things couldn't get worse, Torsten Sløk, the chief economist at Apollo Global Management, has an even starker prediction: a rate hike.\n\nSløk said the massive amount of AI-led borrowing means companies issuing more bonds. The increase in investment-grade bonds could draw investors away from the Treasury market, potentially forcing rates higher.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump laid into Republican Senator Susan Collins in an expletive-laden phone call after she voted against one of his top priorities.\n\nThe president reportedly made a “profanity-laced” call to the vulnerable Republican senator on Thursday, sources told The Hill. Collins was one of five GOP senators to join Democrats in advancing a resolution on the War Powers Act from committee to the floor, which passed in a 52-47 vote earlier in the day.\n\n“He was very mad about the vote,” the source told The Hill. “Very mad. Very hot.”\n\nThe resolution would block the president’s ability to use military force against Venezuela following the U.S. capture of the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro. This throws a wrench in Trump’s plans to seize Venezuela’s oil.\n\nThe source told The Hill that the president “basically read her the riot act,” in a phone call that came “out of the blue.” Collins’ office confirmed to The Hill that the call took place, but did not include any additional details on what the president said. The Daily Beast reached out to the senator’s representatives and the White House for comment.\n\nIn addition to Collins, Republican senators Rand Paul, Lisa Murkowski, Josh Hawley, and Todd Young also voted to advance the war powers resolution. The move made Trump irate. He posted at length about the five conservative lawmakers on his social media platform, Truth Social.\n\n“Republicans should be ashamed of the Senators that just voted with Democrats in attempting to take away our Powers to fight and defend the United States of America,” Trump wrote. “Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Rand Paul, Josh Hawley, and Todd Young should never be elected to office again.”\n\nCollins is up for reelection this year and faces a tight race as Democratic challengers gain in popularity. Her seat will be important for Republicans to maintain control of the Senate after the midterms. However, Trump has been a thorn in his party’s side, openly expressing his desire to see Collins out. This latest call appears to reaffirm his animosity toward the senator.\n\n“The president obviously is unhappy with the vote,” Collins told reporters following Trump’s ire. “I guess this means that he would prefer to have Gov. Mills or somebody else with whom he’s not had a great relationship. I don’t know, I’m just not going to comment.”\n\nThe president has faced pressure and criticism following the operation in Venezuela that ended in Maduro’s capture. While Maduro sits in custody awaiting trial, Trump has announced plans for the U.S. to “run” Venezuela and sell millions of barrels of its oil.\n\nTrump met with major oil executives from companies like Chevron and Exxon on Friday to discuss Venezuela’s oil infrastructure. However, the president, 79, quickly veered off-topic, pausing the meeting to wax poetic about the White House ballroom currently under construction.",

After all, it’s turning out to be a once-in-a-lifetime event full of incredible spectacles, UFC champions, and world-class guests.\n\nThe event is expected to garner such attention and attract dignitaries from around the world that France isn’t willing to go head-to-head with UFC on Trump’s birthday. Can you blame them?\n\n🚨 France is delaying this year’s G7 summit to avoid a scheduling conflict with the UFC White House event on June 14 👀\n\n(via @politico) pic.twitter.com/0XXqSHM8IS\n\n— Championship Rounds (@ChampRDS) January 9, 2026\n\nAccording to a recent report by news outlet Politico, France will move its annual G7 Summit — which seven major industrial countries discuss key global policy issues — from June 14-16 to June 15-17. This clears the way for UFC’s White House card and Trump’s birthday bash on June 14. French President Emmanuel Macron’s office declined to confirm that the rescheduling is directly related to the UFC event and said the change of date is “the result of our consultations with G7 partners.”\n\nWhen asked about the G7 Summit delay a White House official told Politico: “As the leader of the free world, our partners believed that President Trump’s attendance at the G7 Summit was essential. They kindly shifted dates to accommodate the U.S. president’s schedule.”\n\nDana White reshares the news that France has delayed the 2026 G7 summit to avoid a scheduling conflict with the UFC White House event. 😅 pic.twitter.com/xKiSKRSgx3\n\n— MMA Orbit (@mma_orbit) January 9, 2026\n\nFor more UFC White House 2026 news and coverage click HERE.",

    "fullText": "Russia said Friday it used its latest missile against Ukraine for a second time in the nearly 4-year-old war, a forceful signal to Kyiv and its Western allies as U.S.-led peace talks have entered a new and crucial stage.\n\nThe hypersonic Oreshnik intermediate range ballistic missile hit Ukraine's western Lviv region late Thursday night, although officials there did not mention any casualties. The area is near a military base in neighboring Poland, a NATO member, that serves as a key hub for ferrying Western military supplies to Kyiv.\n\nSome Moscow commentators said the attack was a warning to European leaders against proposals to deploy their troops to Ukraine as part of a prospective peace deal. Russia has said it won't accept such a deployment and would view those forces as legitimate targets.\n\nA look at the weapon and why Russia used it now:\n\nWhat’s known about the Oreshnik\n\nRussia first used the multiple-warhead Oreshnik on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro in November 2024.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin said the Oreshnik, which means “hazelnut tree” in Russian, streaks at 10 times the speed of sound, or Mach 10, “like a meteorite,” and was immune to any missile defense system.\n\nHe said the weapon is so powerful that several such missiles -- even fitted with conventional warheads — could be as devastating as a nuclear strike. He said it’s capable of destroying underground bunkers “three, four or more floors down.”\n\nThe Russian military said the Oreshnik can carry nuclear or conventional warheads and can reach any European target.\n\nThe Pentagon said the Oreshnik was an experimental type of intermediate-range ballistic missile, or IRBM, based on Russia’s RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. Intermediate-range missiles can fly between 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,400 miles). Such weapons were banned under a Soviet-era treaty that Washington and Moscow abandoned in 2019.\n\nWhen Russia first used the Oreshnik, Ukraine’s military said the missile had six independently targetable warheads, each carrying six submunitions.\n\nRussian military bloggers said the submunitions released by each warhead apparently were unarmed but had high kinetic energy estimated to deliver a destructive force equivalent to tons of explosives.\n\nSince the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia has used swarms of cheap slow-flying drones and an assortment of other missiles, but none had the range and power of Oreshnik.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said last month the Oreshnik had been deployed to Belarus and entered active service. It didn't specify how many missiles were sent to the key ally of Moscow and whether they were fitted with nuclear warheads, but Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that up to 10 Oreshnik systems will be stationed there.\n\nRussia previously has stationed tactical nuclear weapons inside Belarus, whose territory it used to launch the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn 2024, Putin released a revised nuclear doctrine that placed Belarus under Russia's atomic umbrella. The document significantly lowered the threshold for the possible use of nuclear weapons, declaring that any nation’s conventional attack on Russia that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack on the country. The threat was clearly aimed at discouraging the West from allowing Ukraine to strike Russia with longer-range weapons.\n\nUnlike Russia's other shorter-range conventional weapons, the Oreshnik is able to launch a powerful, conventional strike anywhere in Europe, giving the Kremlin a new instrument of escalation without tapping its nuclear arsenal. There will be no way to know whether the missile is carrying a nuclear or a conventional warhead before it hits the target.\n\nRussia's message by using the Oreshnik\n\nWhen Russia first used the Oreshnik, Putin described it as a response to Ukraine's Western allies allowing it to use their longer-range weapons to strike Russian territory.\n\nIts latest strike comes as the U.S.-led efforts to end the war in Ukraine have entered a pivotal stage and appears to underline Putin’s intention to negotiate from a position of strength as his troops make slow but steady territorial gains.\n\nSome Russian military bloggers noted that the strike in Lviv, not far from the Polish border, was a message intended for Kyiv’s allies. Those members of the “coalition of the willing” have proposed sending their troops to Ukraine as part of security guarantees once a peace deal is reached.\n\nRussia has said it won't accept any European forces in Ukraine, seeing them as legitimate targets.\n\n“For the first time, NATO command has been shown a strategic weapons strike virtually on its border,” said military expert Valery Shiryayev. “This action is intended to demonstrate the determination of Russia’s military and political leadership to use such weapons with nuclear warheads if necessary.”\n\nThe attack comes less than a week after the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a Russian ally. The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced the U.S. action as an act of aggression and sharply criticized Wednesday’s U.S. seizure of a Russia-flagged tanker.",

    "fullText": "LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin's launch of an Oreshnik hypersonic missile appears aimed at intimidating Ukraine and sending a signal of Russian military might to Europe and the United States at a crucial juncture in talks to end the war.\n\nPutin has repeatedly boasted of the speed and destructive power of the Oreshnik, which ​Russia first fired at Ukraine in November 2024. Since then, it has kept the weapon in reserve.\n\nThe overnight Oreshnik strike in western Ukraine came after a week of setbacks for Russia. ‌On Saturday, President Donald Trump sent U.S. special forces to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a close Putin ally, and on Wednesday U.S. forces seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the north Atlantic.\n\nOn Tuesday, Britain and France announced plans to deploy troops in Ukraine ‌in the event of a ceasefire - prompting Moscow to respond that it would view foreign soldiers as legitimate combat targets.\n\nGerhard Mangott, a Russia specialist at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, said Moscow was frustrated at being sidelined during weeks of diplomacy between the U.S., Ukraine and the Europeans, and \"particularly mad\" about the planned potential troop deployment by Kyiv's European allies. The use of the Oreshnik should be seen in that context, he said.\n\n\"It's a signal to the United States and the Europeans about the military capabilities of the Russian army,\" Mangott said in a telephone interview.\n\nHe said Moscow wanted to convey that \"Russia is to be taken seriously, given its military arsenal, ⁠and that the Europeans and Trump should return to a minimum of respect ‌for the Russian position in the negotiations.\"\n\n'DESTRUCTION NOT NECESSARILY THE GOAL'\n\nThe Oreshnik is capable of carrying nuclear as well as conventional warheads, although there was no suggestion of any nuclear component to the latest attack.\n\nA senior Ukrainian official told Reuters that the missile struck a state enterprise in the western city of Lviv and ‍was likely carrying inert or \"dummy\" warheads - as in 2024, when Russia first fired it to test the weapon in war.\n\n\"It does appear that at this point Russia is using Oreshnik for signaling purposes, so the destruction is not necessarily the goal,\" Pavel Podvig, director of the Russian Nuclear Forces Project, told Reuters when asked if the use of dummy warheads would diminish the capacity of Moscow's action to intimidate Ukraine and its allies.\n\n\"It's probably a general signal of resolve ​to escalate. My guess is that it will be read this way by the West,\" he said.\n\nWestern reaction to the attack, around 60 km (40 miles) from Ukraine's border with NATO member Poland, was swift. ‌The leaders of Britain, France and Germany called it \"escalatory and unacceptable\". European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said it was \"a clear escalation against Ukraine and meant as a warning to Europe and to the U.S.\".\n\nRUSSIAN STATEMENT ON REASON FOR MISSILE USE DRAWS SCEPTICISM\n\nRussia specialist Mangott was sceptical about the official statement from Russia's Defence Ministry that the Oreshnik launch was in response to an alleged Ukraine drone strike targeting one of Putin's residences, in the northern region of Novgorod, late last month. Ukraine has denied any such attack took place, accusing Moscow of lying about it in order to derail peace talks.\n\nSeveral high-profile Russian war bloggers also criticised the official framing of the strike as a revenge attack. One, Yuri Baranchik, suggested it would have \"looked more convincing\" if Moscow had fired the missile at President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's bunker in Kyiv.\n\nMick Ryan, ⁠an Australian military expert, linked the weapon's use to Russia's recent setbacks, especially over Venezuela.\n\nHe said the point was \"to demonstrate ​that Russia remains a nuclear-armed world power. In this guise, it is a psychological weapon – an instrument of Putin’s cognitive war ​against Ukraine and the West – rather than a weapon of mass physical destruction.\"\n\nRussian arch-hawk Dmitry Medvedev, a former president who is now deputy chairman of Putin's Security Council, alluded in a social media post to the capture of Maduro, the oil tanker seizure by the U.S. and the possibility of further U.S. sanctions against Russia, which he ‍said had made for a \"stormy\" start to the year.\n\nIn ⁠comments highly critical of Washington, he said international relations had descended into a madhouse and compared the Oreshnik strike to \"a life-saving injection of haloperidol\", an anti-psychotic drug.\n\nProminent Russian war blogger Fighterbomber, a former military serviceman, said he thought the use of the Oreshnik was a display of power to convey a message and that Moscow would not be resorting to it often.\n\nHe noted that ⁠some Oreshnik systems had been transferred to Belarus and that Russia would have some of its own in reserve, but suggested that there was not an endless supply of the relatively new missile.\n\n\"Taking all these constants into account, we can assume that ‌we can afford to conduct such demonstrations two or three times a year,\" he wrote.\n\nHe expressed hope that no further launches would be needed for now, concluding: \"The signals have ‌been sent and they have been heard.\"",

    "description": "Paramount Skydance is still trying to stop Warner Bros. Discovery's Netflix deal. Here are the four most likely endings in the fight for WBD.",
    "fullText": "The war for Warner Bros. Discovery is getting intense.\n\nParamount Skydance isn't surrendering in its quest to buy WBD, even though its offers have been rejected eight times in favor of Netflix's bid.\n\nParamount CEO David Ellison has criticized WBD for not selecting what he's called \"by far the superior offer.\"\n\nWBD has fired back, accusing Paramount of threatening lawsuits and leaking to the press. The company's board of directors said this week in a letter to shareholders that Paramount \"has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction.\"\n\nThere have been many twists and turns in Netflix and Paramount's battle for WBD, and the drama isn't over yet.\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios that could unfold.\n\nAlthough Paramount says its all-cash, $30-per-share offer for all of WBD provides more value and less risk than Netflix's $27.75-per-share bid for WBD's studio and streaming assets, the company could up the ante.\n\nSeveral media insiders, including Disney's former top dealmaker, expect a renewed bidding war for WBD.\n\nTheir view got a boost when Paramount disclosed in a filing that Ellison had texted WBD CEO David Zaslav, saying that Paramount's $30-per-share proposal wasn't its \"best and final\" offer.\n\nWBD investors also seem to be counting on more fireworks, given that its stock is trading north of $28.50, close to $1 per share above Netflix's agreed-upon purchase price. That suggests shareholders believe either Ellison and company or Netflix will fork over more money before WBD changes hands.\n\nParamount might not need to offer another penny if a majority of WBD's shareholders tender their shares, which would put pressure on the board to reconsider its proposal.\n\nAs a public company, WBD's leadership is legally required to act in the best interests of its shareholders. Otherwise, its board could be sued. So, if WBD's investors overwhelmingly prefer Paramount's bid, the board could have no choice but to go with it.\n\nHowever, Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at Lightshed Partners, thinks Paramount won't convince a majority of WBD shareholders to tender their shares. Greenfield predicted that Paramount would then raise its offer to $32 per share, but that Netflix would respond by sweetening its offer, leading to Paramount eventually dropping its bid.\n\nUntil the Netflix deal closes, a competing proposal could come in, since WBD is a public company. Comcast drove up the eventual price of Disney's acquisition of Fox's studio by nearly $20 billion, even though its rival bid came in six months later.\n\nIf Paramount remains adamant that it has a superior proposal that wasn't chosen, it could sue WBD's board of directors, alleging negligence.\n\nWBD has acknowledged that possibility. Paramount \"has been aggressive in its engagement with WBD, has retained litigation counsel and has threatened litigation,\" WBD's board of directors wrote in a letter on Wednesday in which it rejected Paramount's latest offer.\n\nLawyer Raul Gastesi of Gastesi Lopez Mestre & Cobiella has taken note of Paramount's litigious posture and said that now that it has been turned down, \"it is likely to attempt to seek legal remedy such as a shareholder derivative suit or potentially a direct lawsuit.\"\n\nHowever, Reuben Miller, the head of antitrust at data intelligence firm Dealreporter, said that while Paramount is making waves in the court of public opinion, he believes they \"would rather come with an increased offer and avoid litigation than roll the dice in Delaware court.\"\n\nEven if Paramount decides not to sue, there's a chance WBD shareholders could take legal action against WBD's board.\n\nWhile Paramount has taken a hands-on approach to its WBD bid so far, it could let the chips fall and move on if its proposal doesn't win over enough WBD shareholders.\n\nInstead of spending more than $100 billion on WBD, Paramount could put money toward another acquisition, or simply invest in improving its technology and original content.",
