    "fullText": "Ground drones are growing more popular on Ukraine's front lines, but they're still vastly overshadowed by the small aerial drones made famous in the war.\n\nIn November, uncrewed ground vehicles accounted for less than 0.66% of Ukraine's total drone missions.\n\nUsage numbers were announced on Tuesday by Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces, as he gave a statement on the war situation this winter.\n\n\"At the current stage of the war, it is unmanned aerial vehicles that provide about 60% of all strikes on enemy targets,\" Syrskyi wrote.\n\nThe military chief said that in November alone, Ukrainian uncrewed aerial vehicles, or UAVs, carried out over 304,000 missions, striking or destroying roughly 81,500 targets.\n\n\"Over the past six months, this indicator has been constantly growing,\" Syrskyi added.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian uncrewed ground vehicles, or UGVs, carried out 2,000 missions in the same timeframe, he said.\n\nThe statistics underscore just how aerial drones continue to dominate the battlefield in Ukraine. UGVs, an emerging technology, are still finding their footing in the war as Kyiv moves to integrate them at a wider scale among its military units.\n\nAmid the push, dozens of Ukrainian companies and units have been debuting their own UGVs, which can range from miniature buggies to full-size trucks mounted with remote machine gun turrets.\n\nThe ground drones are particularly useful because they can perform dangerous frontline missions that human soldiers would otherwise be required to carry out. Ukrainians are building them to serve a variety of purposes, from direct assaults and mine-clearing to monitoring roads and delivering frontline supplies.\n\nSome units have begun using aerial and ground systems in tandem, such as troops in Pokrovsk who used a UGV to spot incoming Russian vehicles through fog and later attacked with exploding drones.\n\nRussia has also been pioneering new drones, including UGVs for logistics and rocket artillery. On the aerial front, the Kremlin's forces were the first to introduce unjammable, fiber-optic drones that are now proliferating on the battlefield.\n\nThis year, Moscow has repeatedly been reported to be more readily integrating drone warfare into its ranks, scaling up mass production, forming official drone units, and creating new warfighting doctrine after observing Ukrainian tactics.\n\nSyrskyi wrote that Russia had, at one point, reached a \"period of a certain parity\" with Ukraine in the use of first-person-view drones, or the small hobby drones souped up to fly explosives into targets.\n\n\"As reported by our intelligence bodies, the enemy seeks to reach monthly deliveries of up to half a million FPV drones to its troops,\" he wrote.\n\nNow, however, Syrskyi claimed that Ukraine has recently surpassed Russia in first-person-view drone usage.\n\n\"The Ukrainian response must be asymmetric and effective: strengthening the fight against enemy drones and destroying the infrastructure of the enemy's unmanned forces units,\" he added.\n\nSyrskyi's statement offered a grim recap of the war in recent months, saying that Ukraine's forces have \"faced some of the most serious challenges since the beginning of the full-scale war.\"\n\nBoth civilians and soldiers in the country must soon grapple with another brutal winter, as temperatures are expected to consistently drop below freezing in January and February. Russia has been targeting local energy grids, disrupting Ukraine's access to reliable heating.",

    "description": "Former Disney dealmaker Kevin Mayer predicts \"more fireworks\" in the bidding war for Warner Bros. between Netflix and Paramount.",
    "fullText": "A former Disney executive who oversaw its dealmaking expects \"more fireworks\" in the bidding war for Warner Bros.\n\n\"I would be very surprised if we don't see a sweetened, and perhaps meaningfully sweetened, offer\" from Netflix, Paramount Skydance, or both, said Kevin Mayer, Disney's former top dealmaker, on Tuesday at the UBS media conference.\n\nOn Friday, Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets for $82.7 billion, including debt. Paramount Skydance then launched a hostile offer, saying on Monday that it's willing to pay $108.4 billion for the whole firm, including the TV networks like CNN and HGTV. Executives at Netflix and Paramount CEO David Ellison have each framed their offers as the best for employees, Hollywood, WBD shareholders, and TV viewers. Both suitors also said they're confident they can pass regulatory scrutiny.\n\nMayer, now the co-CEO of Cocomelon owner Candle Media, said he thinks Paramount's hostile bid will reignite the faceoff for Warner Bros. and force the eventual winner to fork over more money.\n\n\"From the Warner Bros. Discovery perspective, this is nothing but good news,\" Mayer said.\n\nMayer added: \"Does it move up another $5 billion or $10 billion? I think it probably does. That's what it's going to take to win it.\"\n\nMayer said the battle for Warner Bros. reminds him of the fight for control of 21st Century Fox between Disney and Comcast, which he was involved in during his tenure at the Mouse House.\n\nUnder Mayer, Disney agreed to buy Fox's studio, FX, and its stake in Hulu for $52.4 billion in equity, or $66.1 billion with debt, in December 2017. Six months later, cable giant Comcast made a $65 billion all-cash offer for those same assets. Disney ultimately won, but it was forced to pay a heftier price of $71.3 billion. Mayer helped engineer Disney's initial agreement with Fox, but had moved to a role atop Disney's streaming business by the time the acquisition closed.\n\n\"That was a difficult process,\" Mayer said of Comcast's bid for Fox. \"It added $19 billion to the price tag. Still a good deal, but not the exceptional deal that it was before we had to pay more.\"\n\nWhile Disney's deal with Fox gave it control over Hulu and bolstered its library, Disney activist investor Nelson Peltz argued that the Mouse House had shown \"poor judgment\" by \"overpaying for the 21st Century Fox assets.\"\n\nAs Netflix and Paramount vie for Warner Bros., Mayer said the Disney-Comcast showdown \"points to where we might see this going.\"\n\nThat's because Ellison's $30-per-share hostile bid, which Paramount also sent to WBD's board, might not be rich enough, Mayer said.\n\n\"David Ellison has already kind of hinted at that, that he hasn't done his best and final yet, and I suspect he hasn't,\" Mayer said.\n\nMayer was likely referencing a text message from Ellison to WBD CEO David Zaslav, which was made public as part of a Paramount filing on Monday: \"Please note importantly we did not include 'best and final' in our bid.\"\n\n\"The team at Paramount is aggressive,\" Mayer said. He pointed to the gargantuan amount of money that David Ellison and his father, Oracle billionaire Larry, have at their disposal.\n\n\"I don't think there's a whole lot of hesitancy to spend it,\" Mayer said.",

    "description": "The fight between Netflix and Paramount over who will buy Warner Bros. is heating up. Here's what markets are thinking about the bidding war.",
    "fullText": "A bidding war has broken out over one of America's most iconic media companies, and investors in the three firms involved are mixed on the prospect of where it'll all shake out.\n\nShares of Warner Bros. Discovery have climbed on the back of a hostile bid from Paramount Skydance to acquire the film and television company, but they're still slightly below the competing bid from Netflix, which was announced as the winner of the sale process last Friday.\n\nParamount on Monday made an all-cash offer worth $30 a share to acquire Warner Bros. and its film studio and streaming services.\n\nIt's unclear which way Warner Bros. will go. The company's board of directors said on Monday that it wasn't changing its recommendation regarding its agreement with Netflix, but would review Paramount's offer over the next two weeks. The firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.\n\nMarkets, though, are flashing some clues about what investors think might happen next. Here's what to watch.\n\nShares of Warner Bros. Discovery rose to $27.70 on Tuesday, just below Netflix's offer of $27.75 a share.\n\nIf the stock were to surpass that level, that could be a sign investors expect Warner Bros. to go with Paramount's offer, or that they expect Netflix to put together a better offer, according to Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.\n\n\"I would say that there's a combination of both of those things probably in play right now,\" Hogan said of investors pricing in both scenarios, though he noted that trading activity in Warner Bros. Discovery shares may also be reflecting uncertainty among investors as Paramount revealed its hostile bid on Monday.\n\nThere's also the issue of regulatory approval, which could explain the slight discount in Warner Bros. Discovery stock to Netflix's offer price. Comments from Donald Trump on Monday suggested Netflix's ownership of Warner Bros. could draw scrutiny from the administration.\n\nIn a statement after it unveiled its offer, Paramount said its bid for Warner Bros. Discovery would offer shareholders around $18 billion \n\nNetflix stock is down 7% since last Thursday's close, with shares dropping through Friday's session as investors digested the news that the media giant would acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio business.\n\nInvestors rarely reward the acquirer in a large M&A deal like this, and it appears they're also not thrilled about the prospect of a fierce bidding war.\n\nNetflix stock continued to slide through Monday's session on news of Paramount's competing bid, and dipped again on Tuesday. The streaming platform has agreed to pay Warner Bros. $5.8 billion if its deal doesn't go through.\n\nShares of Paramount Skydance, meanwhile, jumped on Monday on enthusiasm for a potential deal, but the stock slipped 3% on Tuesday.\n\nBettors don't see Paramount's hostile bid going through with ease. While Paramount has edged up slightly over Netflix on some open bets on Polymarket, other wagers have its chances of acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery by mid-2026 at less than 50%.\n\nOn Polymarket, bettors see a 43% chance Paramount will be the winning bid, compared to a 39% chance priced in for Netflix.\n\nOn Kalshi, the odds that Paramount will win are about 50-50.",

Israel has banned international journalists from entering Gaza since the war began more than two years ago, except for rare, brief visits supervised by the military, such as this one.",
    "fullText": "RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — One by one, the soldiers squeezed through a narrow entrance to a tunnel in southern Gaza. Inside a dark hallway, some bowed their heads to avoid hitting the low ceiling, while watching their step as they walked over or around jagged concrete, crushed plastic bottles and tattered mattresses.\n\nOn Monday, Israel's military took journalists into Rafah — the city at Gaza's southernmost point that troops seized last year and largely flattened — as the 2-month-old Israel-Hamas ceasefire reaches a critical point. Israel has banned international journalists from entering Gaza since the war began more than two years ago, except for rare, brief visits supervised by the military, such as this one.\n\nSoldiers escorted journalists inside a tunnel, which they said was one of Hamas' most significant and complex underground routes, connecting cities in the embattled territory and used by top Hamas commanders. Israel said Hamas had kept the body of a hostage in the underground passage: Hadar Goldin, a 23-year-old soldier who was killed in Gaza more than a decade ago and whose remains had been held there.\n\nHamas returned Goldin's body last month as part of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in the war triggered by the militants' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and hundreds taken hostage. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 70,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which operates under the Hamas-run government. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but says roughly half the dead have been women and children.\n\nIsrael and Hamas are on the cusp of finishing the first phase of the truce, which mandated the return of all hostages, living and dead, in exchange for Palestinians held by Israel. The body of just one more hostage remains to be returned.\n\nMediators warn the second phase will be far more challenging since it includes thornier issues, such as disarming Hamas and Israel’s withdrawal from the strip. Israel currently controls more than half of Gaza.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to travel to Washington this month to discuss those next steps with U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nPiles of rubble line Rafah's roads\n\nLast year, Israel launched a major operation in Rafah, where many Palestinians had sought refuge from offensives elsewhere. Heavy fighting left much of the city in ruins and displaced nearly one million Palestinians. This year, when the military largely had control of the city, it systematically demolished most of the buildings that remained standing, according to satellite photos.\n\nTroops also took control of and shut the vital Rafah crossing, Gaza’s only gateway to the outside world that was not controlled by Israel.\n\nIsrael said Rafah was Hamas’ last major stronghold and key to dismantling the group’s military capabilities, a major war aim.\n\nOn the drive around Rafah on Monday, towers of mangled concrete, wires and twisted metal lined the roads, with few buildings still standing and none unscathed. Remnants of people's lives were scattered the ground: a foam mattress, towels and a book explaining the Quran.\n\nLast week, Israel said it was ready to reopen the Rafah crossing but only for people to leave the strip. Egypt and many Palestinians fear that once people leave, they won't be allowed to return. They say Israel is obligated to open the crossing in both directions.\n\nIsrael has said that entry into Gaza would not be permitted until Israel receives all hostages remaining in the strip.\n\nThe tunnel that journalists were escorted through runs beneath what was once a densely populated residential neighborhood, under a United Nations compound and mosques. Today, Rafah is a ghost town. Underground, journalists picked their way around dangling cables and uneven concrete slabs covered in sand.\n\nThe army says the tunnel is more than 7 kilometers (4 miles) long and up to 25 meters (82 feet) deep and was used for storing weapons as well as long-term stays. It said top Hamas commanders were there during the war, including Mohammed Sinwar — who was believed to have run Hamas’ armed wing and was the younger brother of Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who helped mastermind the Oct. 7 attack. Israel has said it has killed both of them.\n\n“What we see right here is a perfect example of what Hamas did with all the money and the equipment that was brought into Gaza throughout the years,\" said Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani. \"Hamas took it and built an incredible city underground for the purposes of terror and holding bodies of hostages.”\n\nIsrael has long accused Hamas of siphoning off money for military purposes. While Hamas says the Palestinians are an occupied people and have a right to resist, the group also has a civilian arm and ran a government that provided services such as health care, a police force and education.\n\nThe army hasn’t decided what to do with the tunnel. It could seal it with concrete, explode it or hold it for intelligence purposes among other options.\n\nSince the ceasefire began, three soldiers have been killed in clashes with about 200 Hamas militants that Israeli and Egyptian officials say remain underground in Israeli-held territory.\n\nHamas has said communication with its remaining units in Rafah has been cut off for months and that it was not responsible for any incidents occurring in those areas.\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas have accused each other of repeated violations of the deal during the first phase. Israel has accused Hamas of dragging out the hostage returns, while Palestinian health officials say over 370 Palestinians have been killed in continued Israeli strikes since the ceasefire took effect.\n\nEditor's Note: This article was submitted for review by Israel’s military censor, which made no changes.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said he wanted to \"do what's right\" in the media war brewing between Netflix, Paramount, and Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nOn Friday, Netflix said that it would acquire WBD for $72 billion. WBD rejected Paramount Skydance's offers and proceeded with a sale to Netflix. But on Monday, Paramount launched a hostile bid, with a $30-per-share offer for all of WBD.\n\nIn response to a question from a reporter about the fight for WBD on Monday, Trump said, \"I know the companies very well. I know what they're doing, but I have to see, I have to see what percentage of market they have.\"\n\n\"We have to see the Netflix percentage of market, Paramount, the percentage of market,\" he said during a roundtable at the White House. \"I mean, none of them are particularly great friends of mine, you know.\"\n\n\"I want to do what's right. It's so, so very important to do what's right,\" he added.\n\nTrump said on Sunday that he would be involved in the sale of WBD, and that the combined market share of Netflix and WBD \"could be a problem.\"\n\nBut he also said that Netflix's CEO, Ted Sarandos, was a \"great person\" who has done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\"\n\nTrump's involvement in the media war is significant because he has the authority to stop a deal from taking place. In 2017, he voiced his opposition to AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner.\n\nBusiness Insider's media and tech correspondent, Peter Kafka, wrote in a column last week that a deal to buy WBD would need regulatory approval, which in 2025 is synonymous with Trump's approval.\n\nParamount is putting up a strong fight for Warner Bros. Its CEO, David Ellison, pitched the WBD offer to his employees in a Monday memo seen by Business Insider.\n\n\"We believe the combination of Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery represents a powerful opportunity to strengthen both companies and the entertainment industry as a whole,\" Ellison's memo wrote.",
