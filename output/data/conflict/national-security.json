    "description": "Rice served in senior roles in the Clinton, Obama, and Biden administrations.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has demanded that Netflix remove former US ambassador and national security advisor Susan Rice from its board, stepping up his criticism of the streaming giant as it seeks to merge with Warner Bros. Discovery amid antitrust scrutiny.\n\nRice, who served in senior roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, recently warned companies against aligning with Trump. Speaking on the \"Stay Tuned with Preet Bharara\" podcast published Thursday, she said corporations that \"take a knee\" to the president and skirt the law should expect consequences, predicting an \"accountability agenda\" if Democrats take back power.\n\n\"There is likely to be a swing in the other direction,\" and these companies are \"going to be caught with more than their pants down,\" Rice said.\" They're going to be held accountable by those who come in opposition to Trump and win at the ballot box.\"\n\nRice, a Democrat, has a long career in US foreign and domestic policy, working under Democratic presidents.\n\nShe served in the Clinton administration from 1993 to 2001, including roles at the National Security Council and as assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs.\n\nUnder Obama, Rice served as US ambassador to the UN, becoming the second-youngest person at 44 and the first Black woman to represent the US at the UN. She later served as head of the Domestic Policy Council under Biden.\n\nShe was born in Washington, D.C., and graduated from Stanford with a degree in history. She worked in management consulting for McKinsey and Company before entering government.\n\nRice has previously faced criticism from the right. In her 2019 memoir, \"Tough Love: My Story of the Things Worth Fighting For,\" she wrote that she was a frequent \"villain\" for conservative media.\n\nAfter the 2012 killing of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, Republicans accused her of misleading the public in interviews discussing the attacks. She was later cleared by subsequent investigations.\n\nShe also faced scrutiny by Trump and his allies for \"unmasking\" senior Trump officials to understand why the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates was in New York in 2016.\n\nUnmasking is when senior government officials ask to learn the identity of a US citizen whose name has been withheld in intelligence reports about communications, such as intercepted calls. In some situations, national security officials argue that knowing the person's identity is necessary to interpret and assess the intelligence information.\n\nAs UN Ambassador, Rice supported US intervention against Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nRice has written op-eds supportive of the Biden administration and accusing Trump of undermining democracy. In a 2025 column in The New York Times, Rice accused members of Trump's national security team of \"reckless negligence\" after they discussed sensitive national security matters on Signal.\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, is a Netflix board member.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is calling on Netflix to remove former US Ambassador and national security advisor Susan Rice from its board, sharpening his criticism of the streaming giant as it seeks to merge with Warner Bros. Discovery amid antitrust scrutiny.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump demanded that Netflix \"immediately terminate\" Rice from its board of directors, \"or pay the consequences,\" amplifying a message from right-wing activist Laura Loomer. Loomer had urged action against Rice, criticizing her role at the company and pointing to recent remarks she made about Trump and corporate America.\n\nRice, who served in senior roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, recently warned companies against aligning themselves too closely with Trump. Speaking on Thursday on the \"Stay Tuned with Preet Bharara\" podcast, she said corporations that \"take a knee\" to the president and break the law should expect consequences, predicting an \"accountability agenda\" if Democrats take back power.\n\nThe clash comes as the streaming giant pursues a high-stakes merger that will require approval from the Department of Justice's antitrust division.\n\nTrump in December said that Netflix had a \"very big market share,\" so its potential acquisition of Warner Bros. \"could be a problem.\"\n\nHowever, in February, he said he \"shouldn't be involved\" in the deal and would defer to his Department of Justice to investigate the proposed merger, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nEarlier this week, during an appearance on Puck's \"The Town\" podcast, Netflix's co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, said that Trump hadn't asked for political concessions during discussions of the possible deal, but was focused on bringing jobs back to Hollywood after years of lower production.\n\nRepresentatives for Netflix and Rice did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump called on Netflix to fire one of its board members, Susan Rice, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and national security adviser, following comments she made about accountability when Democrats return to power.\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social Saturday, “Netflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences. She’s got no talent or skills – Purely a political hack! HER POWER IS GONE, AND WILL NEVER BE BACK. How much is she being paid, and for what??? Thank you for your attention to this matter. President DJT”\n\nTrump Celebrity Supporters: Famous Folks In Favor Of The 47th President\n\nTrump Indicates He’s Really Not Into Netflix Buying WB, Wants To Stop The Streamer’s So-Called “Cultural Takeover”\n\n'Real Time': Bill Maher Responds To Trump's Truth Social Rant, Jokes POTUS Expected Him To \"Put Out\" After Dinner\n\nA Netflix spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThis week, Rice appeared on Preet Bharara’s podcast and said that, for corporate interests, law firms and media, “it is not going to end well for them. For those that decided that they would act in their perceived, very narrow self interest, which I would underscore as very short-term self-interest, and take a knee to Trump, I think they are now starting to realize, ‘Wait a minute, this is not popular. Trump is not popular.'”\n\nShe said that “there is likely to be a swing in the other direction, and they are going to be caught with more than their pants down. They are going to be held accountable by those who come in opposition to Trump and win at the ballot box.”\n\nShe added, “If these corporations think that Democrats, when they come back in power, are going to play by the old rules, and say, ‘Never mind, we will forgive you for all the people you fired and all the policies and principles you violated, all the laws you skirted,’ I think they got another thing coming.”\n\nReferring to Democrats, she said, “We are not going to play by the old set of rules when these guys are playing by a different set of rules. We are going to play by the law. We are not going to violate the law like they did. But we are not going to be suckers.”\n\nTrump linked to a post from Laura Loomer, who has for months lashed out at Netflix along with other MAGA influencers against the streaming giant’s proposed acquisition of Warner Bros., citing in part the its ties to Barack Obama. Rice served as U.S. ambassador the the United Nations in Obama’s first term and national security adviser in his second.\n\nTrump told NBC News earlier this month that he would not be involved in deciding whether his administration will give regulatory approval to a Netflix-Warner Bros. deal or a competing bid from Paramount for all of Warner Bros. Discovery. But he previously said he would be involved, despite the long-held political norm of presidents keeping at arms’ length from the Justice Department.\n\nTrump has publicly offered praise for Ted Sarandos, the Netflix co-CEO, after meeting with him multiple times, including at a White House visit in November.\n\nSarandos appeared before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee at a hearing earlier this month, where he was pressed on the competitive impact of the transaction. But several Republicans on the committee pressed Sarandos on culture war issues, including content featuring transgender individuals, even though the DOJ is reviewing the merger for antitrust issues.\n\nParamount, meanwhile, has ties to Trump that include his longtime friend and investor, Larry Ellison, and his son, Skydance founder and the merged company’s CEO, David Ellison. Paramount’s chief legal officer, Makan Delrahim, led the DOJ antitrust division during Trump’s first term.\n\nRice’s point — that Democrats will hold companies accountable if they regain power — was underscored this week when a group of senators fired off a letter to David Ellison, asking him to preserve documents after he declined to answer questions about Paramount’s dealings with Trump.\n\nNetflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences. She’s got no talent or skills – Purely a political hack! HER POWER IS GONE, AND WILL NEVER BE BACK. How much is she being paid, and for what???
