    "description": "Deno 2.6 introduces deno audit with a new --socket flag that plugs directly into Socket to bring supply chain security checks into the Deno CLI.",
    "fullText": "Deno 2.6 was released this week with new security improvements that make it easier to catch threats before they hit production. The release introduces a new deno audit command that scans your dependencies against GitHub's CVE database, along with granular controls for lifecycle scripts and minimum dependency age requirements.\n\nDeno 2.6 also includes experimental Socket integration through deno audit --socket, which queries Socket's Firewall API to fetch malicious package detections and supply chain risk indicators in real time. While CVE databases catalog vulnerabilities after they've been discovered and reported, Socket's Firewall analyzes package behavior to catch threats as they emerge, things like typosquatting, malicious install scripts, and obfuscated code that slip past traditional scanners.\n\nSocket's supply chain security risk detection is available through two authentication modes:\n\nUnauthenticated mode provides instant security scanning for any Deno project:\n\nAuthenticated mode applies your organization's security policies when SOCKET_API_KEY is set as an environment variable. Teams can enforce company-wide rules and access detailed threat analysis across their entire dependency graph.\n\nTraditional vulnerability scanning relies on CVE databases, which only catch known exploits after they've been reported and cataloged. Socket's approach analyzes package behavior to detect supply chain attacks before they have a chance to hit your codebase.\n\nWith the Socket integration, Deno users get access to our threat detection for free, with continuous tracking of every package and version on npm (and other popular open source registries). Socket has identified and flagged thousands of malicious packages that will never receive CVEs, including attacks like Shai-Hulud, cryptomining campaigns, and the frequent typosquatting attempts targeting popular packages.\n\nDeno 2.6 integrates tsgo for faster typechecking. The team has observed a 2x speed improvement on type checking times for internal projects. The release also includes several security and dependency management features that complement Socket integration:\n\nGranular script control with deno approve-scripts replaces the previous --allow-scripts flag. When installing packages with lifecycle scripts, Deno prompts you to review and approve each package individually. Your choices persist in deno.json, creating an audit trail of which packages can execute code during installation.\n\nDependency age requirements let you specify minimum package ages in deno.json. Setting \"minimumDependencyAge\": \"7 days\" ensures your project only uses dependencies that have been publicly available long enough for the community to identify potential issues.\n\nThe dx command provides an npx-equivalent for running package binaries. While it defaults to full permissions like npx, it prompts before downloading packages and running lifecycle scripts, giving you visibility into what code executes during installation.\n\nCheck out the Deno 2.6 announcement post",

    "fullText": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — The United States is using its economic power to “assert its will\" and threaten military force against friend and foe alike, a Danish intelligence agency said in a new report.\n\nThe Danish Defense Intelligence Service, in its latest annual assessment, said Washington's greater assertiveness under the Trump administration also comes as China and Russia seek to diminish Western, especially American, influence.\n\nPerhaps most sensitive to Denmark — a NATO and European Union member country, and a U.S. ally — is growing competition between those great powers in the Arctic. U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed a desire to see Greenland, a semiautonomous and mineral-rich territory of Denmark, become part of the United States, a move opposed by Russia and much of Europe.\n\n“The strategic importance of the Arctic is rising as the conflict between Russia and the West intensifies, and the growing security and strategic focus on the Arctic by the United States will further accelerate these developments,” said the report, published Wednesday.\n\nThe assessment also follows the release last week of a new Trump administration national security strategy that depicts European allies as weak and aims to reassert America’s dominance in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said Russia is worried about NATO’s activities in the Arctic and will respond by strengthening its military capability in the polar region.\n\nThe findings and analyses in the report echo a string of recent concerns, notably in Western Europe, about an increasingly go-it-alone approach by the United States, which under Trump's second term has favored bilateral deals and partnerships at the expense of multilateral alliances like NATO.\n\n“For many countries outside the West, it has become a viable option to forge strategic agreements with China rather than the United States,” read the report, which was written in Danish. “China and Russia, together with other like-minded states, are seeking to reduce Western – and particularly US – global influence.”\n\n“At the same time, uncertainty has grown over how the United States will prioritize its resources in the future,” it added. “This gives regional powers greater room for maneuver, enabling them to choose between the United States and China or to strike a balance between the two.”\n\nThe Trump administration has raised concerns about respect for international law with its series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean — part of a stepped-up pressure campaign against President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela.\n\nTrump has also refused to rule out military force in Greenland, where the United States already has a military base.\n\n“The United States is leveraging economic power, including threats of high tariffs, to assert its will, and the possibility of employing military force – even against allies – is no longer ruled out,” the report said.",

    "description": "“When your plus-minus, and your offense and defense is where we’re at, we’re taking some strides. We understand there’s another level we can get to.”",
    "fullText": "At 15-6, the Houston Rockets have moved just past the quarter pole of the 82-game regular season. That total of six losses is tied for the second-fewest in the 2025-26 Western Conference.\n\nYet, the Rockets aren’t entirely satisfied. They rank second in the NBA in overall net rating (+10.8) and defensive rating, trailing only the defending champion Oklahoma City Thunder. They are fourth in offensive rating.\n\nOf those six losses, five were games that could have been won in the fourth quarter. Crunch-time execution, particularly in half-court situations, has been an occasional issue. So, with a team led by a pair of 2025 All-Stars in Kevin Durant and Alperen Sengun, the Rockets believe they’re capable of more.\n\nComing off Saturday’s short-handed loss at Dallas on night two of a split back-to-back, the Rockets are currently in a rare scheduling break, with their next game not coming until Thursday (home versus the Los Angeles Clippers).\n\nSo, in the aftermath of a stretch with five games in seven nights, head coach Ime Udoka allowed his weary team to take Sunday and Monday off, entirely.\n\nBut Tuesday, the Rockets were back at it inside their Houston practice facility, and team activities included both a film session and a competitive practice.\n\nSpeaking post-practice, Udoka offered this assessment to local reporters (via Space City Home Network, SCHN):\n\nIt’s always good to dive into what we’ve done, and look at some trends. And then, we attack those on the court.\n\nWe want to be great, but I think we’ve been good, overall. If you look at the record, 15-6, there are some positives there. But we also feel like we let some (games) slip away, so we’re trying to find the areas where we’ve grown or had some slippage in. Overall, it’s good, but we’re trying to be better than good.\n\nWhat we looked at, today, was where we were at after the first 10 games, and what was happening in the last 11. You see some good and bad trends, overall. But for the most part, when your plus-minus is where we’re at, and offense and defense is where we’re at, we’re taking some good strides. We understand there’s another level we can get to.\n\nAs far as identifying potential issues beyond crunch-time execution. the Rockets are also 0-2 on night two of back-to-backs and 15-4 in all other settings. Fortunately, they have only one back-to-back (at Denver and Sacramento on Dec. 20 and 21) remaining this month, and they hope to have additional roster reinforcements — namely, Tari Eason and Dorian Finney-Smith — before the volume of back-to-backs increases in January.\n\nThursday’s tipoff versus the Clippers (6-18) is at 7:00 p.m. Central from Toyota Center, and the game will be televised regionally on SCHN and nationally via NBA League Pass.\n\nMore: Tari Eason, Dorian Finney-Smith hope to rejoin Rockets in coming weeks\n\nIme Udoka meets with the media after the #Rockets returned to practice today\nThe team last played on Saturday the final game of 5 games in 7 days\nNext up the Clippers at home Thursday.@HoustonRockets I #AllFire pic.twitter.com/0odUbry02R\n\n— Space City Home Network (@SpaceCityHN) December 9, 2025\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rockets Wire: Ime Udoka: 15-6 Rockets are good, but striving for ‘better than good’",
