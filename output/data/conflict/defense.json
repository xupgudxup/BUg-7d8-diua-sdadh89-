    "title": "Trump's message to defense contractors: There might be a lot more money coming, but only if you deliver",
    "description": "The White House is calling for much more defense spending while pressuring contractors to prioritize production over profits.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump sent jolts through the defense industry this week by mixing talk of a $1.5 trillion defense budget with a blunt warning to contractors: Prioritize production and readiness, not Wall Street.\n\nThe apparent messaging behind a string of Truth Social posts, a new executive order, and the president's call for boosting the defense budget by 50% is that there's going to be a lot of cash on the table, but only for companies that produce and deliver weapons on time.\n\nA venture capital investor focused on aerospace and defense told Business Insider that Trump is effectively saying: \"I've got a really big pool of money here, but I'm only going to be giving it to people that are going to play ball.\"\n\nThe new executive order empowers the Pentagon to pressure contractors that it feels aren't moving fast enough and are perceived to instead be prioritizing profits for top executives and shareholder returns over production demands.\n\nThe Pentagon is now authorized to crack down on underperforming defense contractors by limiting stock buybacks and dividends, linking executive pay to production and delivery, and using contract and emergency authorities to force faster output and investment.\n\nThere are questions about the degree to which the Department of Defense can influence company decisions, but it sends a clear signal that the government intends to at least try to tell weapons makers how to run their businesses.\n\n\"MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS NOT BEING MADE FAST ENOUGH,\" Trump wrote on social media this week before singling out the major defense firm Raytheon (now RTX Corp) in a follow-up post.\n\n\"Either Raytheon steps up,\" Trump wrote, urging the company to build more facilities and equipment, \"or they will no longer be doing business with\" the government. RTX is one of the world's leading producers of missiles like the Tomahawk cruise missile; it also makes radars and sensors, among other technologies.\n\nIt's extremely unusual to see this level of federal government involvement in contractor financial decisions.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like that,\" Jerry McGinn, the director of the Center for the Industrial Base at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, told Business Insider.\n\nDefense stocks tumbled hard with the string of announcements but jumped as the Trump administration floated the possibility of a massive increase in defense spending, which would need Congress's approval.\n\nThis new push reflects growing concern that America’s defense sector has slipped, with capacity, capability, and experience today well below Cold War levels, leaving the US potentially ill-prepared for the possibility of a major war, such as a conflict with China.\n\nThe Trump administration appears to be trying to force a reset while also offering more money and more predictable demand, acknowledging the government itself has not always been a reliable customer. The hollowing out of the defense industry since the Cold War's end has left the federal government highly dependent on a few companies with the necessary industrial facilities to design and produce complex weapons on a large scale.\n\nThe administration has signaled from the get-go that the big established arms makers are in its crosshairs, with a dramatic shift in support toward agile start-ups over the primes, even if it's still making substantial business deals with them.\n\n\"We are going to completely disrupt the system that held the Army back for decades and lined the primes' pockets for so long,\" Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll said last year.\n\nThe Army's top civilian official previously said that he would like to see one of the big defense power players in the contracting world go out of business. And now there's increased pressure.\n\n\"The EO is more of a hammer,\" McGinn said of Trump's newest executive order targeting the US defense industrial base.\n\n\"It still raises a lot of questions about what's enforceable,\" he added, especially with some of the Truth Social mandates that weren't included in the executive order. But \"the strategy is all about focusing on how do you change, how do you make it more attractive for companies to invest, to build factories ahead of need.\"\n\nWith the president's new executive order on defense contracting, the companies that \"stand to lose the most\" are \"the existing primes,\" Justus Parmar, CEO of Fortuna Investments, an America-first venture capital firm, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Legacy defense companies,\" Parmar said, \"they're kind of like taxicabs. They need a bit of disruption.\" He sees the rising defense firms like the ride-share companies that changed the game.\n\nThe primes, the biggest defense contractors, are far from powerless. Their scale, capital, and decades of experience give them room to resist pressure, and in certain defense technologies, they remain the only game in town.\n\nLockheed Martin, for instance, is still producing F-35 stealth fighters, Huntington Ingalls Industries is still building aircraft carriers, and Boeing has a major contract for the new sixth-generation F-47 fighter jet.\n\nWhile some big companies didn't respond, others signaled a willingness to engage. Lockheed Martin, for instance, said it \"shares President Trump's and the Department of War's focus on speed, accountability, and results, and will continue to invest and innovate at scale to ensure our warfighters maintain a decisive advantage and are never sent into a fair fight.\"\n\nThe newcomers, the start-ups and rising firms making big plays \"have the most to gain\" from what's unfolding right now, Parmar said, calling the latest Trump moves a \"tide shift.\"\n\nPalmer Luckey, the founder of Anduril, said this week that he \"broadly\" supports the president's agenda, saying that \"it's good to scare people sometimes.\" Anduril has been pitting itself up against major defense contractors in areas of emerging tech, like collaborative combat aircraft, advanced drones designed to operate alongside piloted fighters.\n\nMcGinn said \"there's a strong recognition that we need to get more out of our defense industrial base and we need new entrants.\" New technology spaces like drones, counter-drone systems, and command and control architecture improvements are opening the doors for new players, particularly those that move fast.\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth laid out the administration's approach last November, briefing industry CEOs and releasing a new acquisition strategy aimed at overhauling what it calls an outdated system and a weakened defense industrial base.\n\nHegseth has said his focus is on building the \"arsenal of freedom\" to better prepare the US military for modern warfare.\n\nThe plan is aimed at accelerating modernization, rapidly expanding production, surging capacity, and putting military acquisition and industry on a \"wartime footing\" that favors speed and execution over process.\n\nThis process takes time though, Parmar said. \"The existing primes, they're entrenched. They're not going anywhere quickly.\"\n\n\"It's going to be a slow bleed,\" he said,\" a slow transition until some of these other companies start to get market share.\"",

    "description": "France's defense ministry picked Mistral to supply military AI systems running on national infrastructure, demonstrating Europe's push for tech sovereignty.",
    "fullText": "French AI startup Mistral has secured a major vote of confidence from its home government after landing a deal to provide AI technology to France's military.\n\nFrance's Ministry of the Armed Forces said on Thursday that it has formally notified a framework agreement with Mistral AI, giving the country's armed forces, defense agencies, and affiliated public institutions access to the company's advanced AI models, software, and services.\n\nUnder the deal overseen by the ministry's defense AI agency, Mistral's AI systems will be deployed on French-controlled infrastructure, a key priority for the military as governments grow increasingly cautious about where sensitive data is processed and which laws govern it.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post announcing the deal, Mistral said its AI systems would be deployed on France's own infrastructure and fine-tuned using defense-specific data to support operational military needs.\n\nThe financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed. Mistral was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Business Insider.\n\nThe agreement marks a significant win for Mistral, which was founded in 2023 and is valued at roughly $13.6 billion, following a 1.7 billion euro ($2 billion) funding round announced last year.\n\nThe startup has positioned itself as a European alternative to US AI heavyweights, such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, pitching its models as powerful yet more compatible with Europe's sovereignty and data control ambitions.\n\nIn its statement, translated by Business Insider, the defense ministry said the partnership is intended to strengthen France's \"technological sovereignty\" and ensure the armed forces maintain control over critical AI tools used across military operations and administration.\n\nBertrand Rondepierre, director of the ministry's defense AI agency, said the agreement represents \"a major step\" in strengthening the ministry's generative AI capabilities and preparing the armed forces for future challenges, while maintaining sovereign control over the technologies used.\n\nThe deal comes as European governments reassess their dependence on US technology in strategic sectors ranging from cloud computing to semiconductors and now AI.\n\nThe French ministry's move mirrors that of the US government, which has increasingly inked major contracts with domestic AI companies to develop tools for military and national security use, including recent deals with OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, and other defense-focused startups.\n\nAs generative AI becomes increasingly embedded in military planning, logistics, and analysis, Mistral's latest win helps to position the startup as one of Europe's key players in the race to develop sovereign alternatives to American tech giants.\n\nDo you work for Mistral and have a tip or story to share?

Legacy defenses, designed for rule-based software, cannot safeguard gen AI systems that learn and adapt from data. By combining survey data, executive interviews, and lab analysis, new research reveals systemic gaps: fragile supply chains, opaque vendor services, and an acute shortage of AI-security talent. The implications are clear.

    "description": "All it took was a pledge for $1.5 trillion in military spending to spark a reversal in the sector.",
    "fullText": "The \"TACO trade,\" short for Trump Always Chickens Out, was one of the great market memes of 2025. Whenever the market would throw a tantrum about a Trump policy — usually related to tariffs — the president would reverse course to stem the bleeding.\n\nA similar story has played out this week within US defense stocks, with a few unique twists. Here's the minute-by-minute recap from Wednesday afternoon:\n\nIt was that last statement, 2 hours and 9 minutes after Trump's first post about defense companies, that sparked a rally in those exact same defense stocks on Thursday. The optimism of a huge spending increase had offset the initial sting of industry criticism.\n\nIt wasn't a precise TACO trade situation. It was closer to something I'd like to coin as the TUNA trade: Trump Usually Negates Announcements. The president didn't outright reverse a prior statement. He countered a bearish opinion with something bullish that counterbalanced it. There's a big difference!\n\nThe volatile episode leaves questions unanswered about the future of the industry. The knee-jerk reaction from investors was to buy/sell first, then ask questions later. What does the longer term look like?\n\nWall Street analysts generally support the idea that the additional military spending will offset any new capital restrictions.\n\n\"The changes are significant but not necessarily draconian,\" said JPMorgan analyst Seth Seifman. A \"potential budget increase would support sustained growth, taking some sting out of the executive order.\"\n\nKen Herbert, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, says large-cap defense companies will feel the squeeze more than their defense-tech counterparts, which he sees outperforming.\n\n\"Defense primes will look to de-risk major program investments by securing long-term purchase agreements, where possible,\" he added.\n\nJefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu called Trump's comments an \"overreach\" and said that they catalyzed something that was already bound to happen.\n\n\"The industry has been clear that it is ready to invest on clearer demand signals,\" she said.\n\nFrom a demand perspective, $1.5 trillion in 2027 sounds quite appealing. If all goes according to plan — and that's a big \"if\" — more stock gains could be in store for defense companies.",

    "title": "What Trump's plan to ban defense dividends and raise the military budget could mean for your portfolio",
    "description": "Defense stocks pay relatively high dividends, but there are alternative areas of the market for investors to consider if they want steady income.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump sent defense stocks on a roller coaster ride this week, and his recent executive orders on defense firms and his calls for more defense spending could impact investors' portfolios.\n\nThe president signed an order aimed at restricting some financial behavior among defense contractors, including an executive order that bans defense firms from issuing dividend payments and doing stock buybacks until they deliver a \"superior product.\" Meanwhile, Trump said on Wednesday that he wants the US military budget could raised to a record $1.5 trillion next year.\n\nBoth developments have implications for investors who have money in the defense sector, which is known for paying relatively high dividends. Lockheed Martin, for instance, has an annual dividend yield of around 2%, compared to about 1% for the broader S&P 500.\n\nHere's the rundown of how investors should be thinking about the latest news — and what it means for their portfolios.\n\nFor the most part, investors shouldn't be thinking about their long-term investments too differently. Trump's push to ban dividend payments seems largely hypothetical, and it's unclear how the president will enforce such a rule, said Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.\n\n\"It feels as though this was making another random social media announcement that will likely die on the vine,\" Hogan told Business Insider. \"I don't know you need to make a rush to judgment in terms of changing your long-term investment plans.\"\n\nBesides the threat of barring dividend payments, Trump's announcements on social media seem largely positive for defense investors, José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, said. He added that those who aren't dependent on dividend payments should remain invested in the sector, pointing to the potential for growth.\n\n\"I think that investors can look forward to improved quality from those companies, in the best-case scenario,\" he told BI.\n\nIf defense companies fall in line and pause dividend payments, that could hurt investors who specifically hold dividend-paying stocks for regular income, Torres said.\n\nBut those investors can move to other dividend-paying areas of the market. Torres encouraged investors to consider value sectors with high dividend yields, such as energy and healthcare.\n\nB. Riley's Hogan encouraged investors to consider areas like energy, consumer staples, pharmaceuticals, utilities, and other parts of the industrial sector, a broader umbrella that covers defense stocks.\n\nDividend ETFs, which track a basket of dividend-paying companies, are also an option for investors chasing dividends, he added.\n\n\"There's a lot of dividend darlings for sure,\" Hogan said. \"I think investors, if in fact they feel nervous about the potential for dividend cuts or the removal of dividends in any space, as unlikely as that prospect seems, there are ways to navigate around that.\"\n\nInvestors should be watching their bond investments, Peter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research, said.\n\nBerezin said that the significant increase in defense spending could lead to a rise in bond yields, which would mean bond prices could fall.\n\nInteractive Brokers' Torres also said he believed bond investors should \"absolutely\" be concerned about the more robust military budget, which could raise long-end bond yields in particular.\n\nLong-end bond yields have climbed in recent years as concerns have risen about the US deficit and rising levels of government debt. Higher debt levels make investors more wary of purchasing long-term US Treasurys, which means yields need to rise to attract investors. Heavy borrowing and spending are also inflationary, which could push yields higher down the road as the central bank adjusts monetary policy to keep prices under control.\n\nTorres didn't recommend selling bonds at the moment. He believes concerns around debt have caused long-end bond yields in the US to be \"too high,\" and he expects those yields to ease soon.\n\n\"I'm a bond bull at this juncture,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is targeting the bank accounts of defense contractor CEOs.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order outlining new rules for defense contractors that would ban stock buybacks and dividends \"until such time as they are able to produce a superior product, on time and on budget\" — as well as limit executive compensation.\n\nThe order stipulates that in future contracts, if the Secretary of War were unsatisfied with a company's performance, executive base salaries would be capped at current levels. Future contracts would also ensure compensation \"not be tied to short-term financial metrics\" and instead be \"linked to an on-time delivery, increased production, and all necessary facilitation of investments and operating improvements.\"\n\nThe goal, per the executive order, is to increase the speed of innovation at defense companies, rather than focus on corporate profits.\n\nTrump also took aim at the leaders of defense contractors in a series of posts on Truth Social on Wednesday.\n\n\"Executive Pay Packages in the Defense Industry are exorbitant and unjustifiable given how slowly these Companies are delivering vital Equipment to our Military,\" Trump wrote. \"Salaries, Stock Options, and every other form of Compensation are far too high for these Executives.\"\n\nHe proposed that no executive should earn \"in excess of $5 million\" until their production speed and maintenance improve, though the executive order did not cap pay at that exact amount.\n\nThe leaders of the big five defense contractors — Lockheed Martin, RTX (formerly known as Raytheon), Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics — each earned more than $18 million in total compensation in 2024, the most recent year for which data is available. Their total income was a combination of salary, incentives, stock options, and other forms of compensation, including the value of security services and changes in the value of pension funds.\n\nWhile exceeding the $5 million cap proposed by Trump by magnitudes, the CEOs' compensation pales in comparison to that of some other business leaders.\n\nDozens of CEOs earned more than them in 2024. James Robert Anderson, who runs materials manufacturer Coherent, had a pay package of more than $100 million last year. The CEOs of Starbucks, GE, and Microsoft each made more than $75 million.\n\nExecutive pay and stock transactions are part of Trump's larger plans for the military. On Wednesday evening, he said on Truth Social that America's military budget should be increased to $1.5 trillion in 2027, up from the record 2026 defense budget of $901 billion.\n\nThat sent defense stocks climbing on Thursday morning, gaining back what they'd lost following the signing of the executive order.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider regarding the order, a spokesperson for Lockheed Martin said the company \"shares President Trump's and the Department of War's focus on speed, accountability, and results, and will continue to invest and innovate at scale to ensure our warfighters maintain a decisive advantage and are never sent into a fair fight.\"\n\nBoeing and General Dynamics declined to comment, and Northrop Grumman and RTX did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "Two US Navy destroyers helped American forces chase down, board, and ultimately seize a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the North Atlantic after a weekslong chase across the ocean, a defense official told Business Insider on Thursday.\n\nThe Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers USS Bulkeley and USS Paul Ignatius \"supported\" the operations to seize the vessel, initially called Bella 1, on Wednesday, the official said.\n\nThe official declined to provide additional details about the warships' role in the seizure, citing operational security concerns.\n\nThe destroyers' involvement in the mission, which also included the Coast Guard and special operations forces, highlights the scale of the US military's efforts to capture the oil tanker, on the run since it evaded a naval blockade. Flight-tracking data showed various aircraft were airborne either shortly before or during the operation.\n\nThe UK government said it supported the operation with a tanker and Royal Air Force surveillance aircraft. A NATO official told Business Insider that the alliance's standing naval forces were not involved.\n\nBella 1, which has been described by the Trump administration as a \"dark fleet\" tanker operating in violation of sanctions, evaded a US naval blockade of sanctioned vessels near Venezuela last month and avoided attempts by the American military to board the vessel.\n\nThe tanker, sailing under the flag of Guyana, then fled north into the Atlantic, reflagged as a Russian vessel, and changed its name to the Marinera. On the run, the crew even painted the country's tricolor on the hull.\n\nThe Coast Guard pursued the tanker for weeks. The unusual chase ended on Wednesday when American forces seized the vessel in waters about halfway between the UK and Iceland.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told reporters that because the vessel had a judicial seizure order, the ship's crew is \"subject to prosecution for any applicable violation of federal law, and they will be brought to the United States for such prosecution if necessary.\"\n\nRussia's foreign ministry condemned the seizure and said that threats to prosecute the tanker's crew \"are entirely unacceptable,\" the state-owned news agency Tass reported on Thursday.\n\nSeparately, the US military said that it seized another sanctioned tanker — M/T Sophia — near the Caribbean Sea on Wednesday after it was \"conducting illicit activities\" in the region.\n\nThe back-to-back interdictions mark the latest in a string of vessel seizures that have occurred since the US announced last month that a naval blockade on sanctioned oil tankers trying to enter or leave Venezuela was going into effect.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the two tankers that were seized on Wednesday had either \"last docked\" in Venezuela or were sailing to the country.\n\n\"The United States continues to enforce the blockade against all dark fleet vessels illegally transporting Venezuelan oil to finance illicit activity, stealing from the Venezuelan people,\" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday after the operations. \"Only legitimate and lawful energy commerce — as determined by the US — will be permitted.\"\n\nThe US naval blockade was set up as part of a pressure campaign against Venezuela's former president, Nicolás Maduro, whom the US had long accused of facilitating drug trafficking and other criminal activity, allegations he denies.\n\nThe campaign also included a massive US military buildup in the Caribbean that began in August. American forces carried out dozens of airstrikes on alleged drug boats over the following months, as President Donald Trump threatened to take action against Venezuela.\n\nTensions between Trump and Maduro culminated over the weekend, when the US staged a dramatic surprise operation to capture Maduro. American forces who raided his compound in Caracas were supported by more than 150 military aircraft.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has threatened additional action against other countries near Venezuela, including Colombia, Cuba, and Mexico.",

    "description": "Trump targeted two sectors in his latest attacks: single-family homes and defense contractors.",
    "fullText": "Home is where the heart is, but not where the institutional investors are.\n\nAt least, that's President Donald Trump's proposed plan. In a post on Truth Social, he said he's \"immediately\" taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying single-family homes.\n\n\"People live in homes, not corporations,\" Trump wrote.\n\nIt was one of two attacks the president issued on the business world. The other targeted a group familiar with crosshairs: defense contractors.\n\nTrump said he would \"not permit\" defense companies to issue dividends or do stock buybacks until they sped up production. He also criticized industry executives' \"exorbitant and unjustifiable\" compensation packages.\n\nBlackstone, a large institutional investor in residential real estate, and defense contractors Northrop Grumman and Raytheon Technologies were among the companies that saw their share prices immediately drop following the posts.\n\nFor Trump, it's in line with a new form of capitalism he's ushered in during his second term. One with more government involvement in the private sector, including taking individual stakes in companies, as BI's Emily Stewart previously covered. (You can also see my ugly mug discussing the idea here.)\n\nIt's a topic we're focusing on this year at BI with our series, \"The Future of Capitalism.\"\n\nThe intention behind Trump's latest attacks seems squarely focused on his biggest opponent these days: affordability.\n\nFrom houses to groceries to everything in between, rising prices have been a real thorn in Trump's side. The president has maintained he inherited these problems from his predecessor, but that hasn't softened the blow for some Americans.\n\nOn paper, going after institutional investors in the housing market is the perfect antidote. The real-estate market has been a mess the past few years, and frustrated home buyers love to blame Wall Street.\n\nIn reality, it's not that clear-cut, as BI's James Rodriguez has previously reported.\n\nOne analysis from October 2023 found investors with at least 1,000 units in their portfolio owned just 0.73% of all single-family homes in the US. However, regions like the southeast have a more concentrated number of institutional investors.\n\nStill, the housing shortage is more likely the reason you can't find, or afford, your dream home. Trump didn't mention anything about institutional investors having to sell the houses they already own. And even if you want to, you can't really yell at boomers to start selling theirs.",

I now cannot pay dividends. I now cannot do stock buybacks if I'm not investing in new plants,\" Luckey told Bloomberg.\n\nThe Anduril founder told Bloomberg he pays himself a salary of $100,000 a year, in addition to owning \"a lot\" of Anduril.\n\nLuckey's startup, which makes autonomous weapons, is valued at $30.5 billion as of June 2025 and is considering an IPO. The company's mission is to modernize the US military through technology, including surveillance devices, air vehicles, and autonomous weapons.\n\nAs the United States hustles to modernize warfare, Anduril has emerged as the face of the defense tech boom and proved it can compete for contracts with legacy defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Boeing.\n\n\"If these companies were doing really well, and if they were living up to their end of the bargain, I don't think you would see any action from Trump or others on this. It's really a reflection of how many problems we have with our defence industrial base,\" Luckey told Bloomberg.\n\nWithout specifying, he added that he thought some of Trump's proposals \"might be bad moves\" for the defense base, but that \"in concept,\" everything should be on the table.",

    "fullText": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth aggressively jumped in to cut off Secretary of State Marco Rubio to yell at a reporter on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe two Cabinet members had just come out of a meeting to brief senators on the U.S. operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and explain the path forward.\n\nRubio had been taking a series of questions from reporters when he was asked about how much involvement in Venezuela would cost U.S. taxpayers before being cut off.\n\nThe secretary of state insisted it would not cost the U.S. any money and claimed the oil deal would not either.\n\n“None of these troops sit in a dry dock waiting for action,” Rubio said. “They’re deployed somewhere in the world. If they’re not here, they’re somewhere else.”\n\nHe argued that if the ships were not in the Caribbean, they would be ”somewhere else conducting activity.”\n\nHegseth had been standing by, at times smirking, as Rubio spoke, but then he stepped forward, forcing the Secretary of State to shift aside, so he could chime in.\n\n“I want to emphasize that question from CNN,” Hegseth said, glaring at the reporter Manu Raju before launching a verbal attack.\n\n“The questions never asked how much does it cost when they’re in the Mediterranean, or the Red Sea or the Indian Ocean or the Pacific, but now that they’re in our hemisphere and a counter cartel mission or ensuring an indicted individual comes to justice, now now you’re asking the question of cost,” Hegseth raged, gesturing his hand for emphasis. “It’s a disingenuous question to begin with.”\n\nBut the defense secretary did not stop there as he continued to rant at the reporter who tried to respond.\n\n“You’re trying to find any angle possible to undermine the success of one of the most historic military missions the world has ever seen,” Hegseth declared.\n\nThe defense secretary went on to claim that the operation in Venezuela was one that only the U.S. could accomplish and argued the world is “taking notice of that.”\n\nHe went on to tout the seizure of oil tankers being pursued by the U.S.\n\nWhile Rubio had been taking questions, Hegseth ignored follow-up attempts from reporters and instead spoke louder.\n\n“Our military is prepared to continue this as he said,” Hegseth said, gesturing back to Rubio. “The president when he speaks, he means it, means it. He’s not messing around. We’re an administration of action to advance our interests, and that is on full display.”\n\nHe then quickly stepped back without taking a single question as Rubio pointed out that the officials needed to go brief members of the House.\n\nHegseth ignored questions and beat a hasty retreat as questions were yelled about whether the U.S. would put boots on the ground and more.\n\nBefore the defense secretary’s rant in front of the cameras, Rubio attempted to lay out the Trump administration’s plan for Venezuela and insisted that, despite criticism, they’re not just winging it.\n\nHe outlined that stabilizing the country relied heavily on the “quarantine” as leverage and execution of a deal to take the oil out of Venezuela. He repeated the claim that the U.S. would take out 30 to 50 million barrels of oil and sell it.\n\n“That money would then be handled in such a way that we will control how it is disbursed in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people, not corruption, not the regime,” Rubio argued.\n\nThe secretary of state said the second phase would be making sure the U.S. has access to the Venezuelan market that’s “fair.” He said the third phase would be the transition. He did not provide a timeline.\n\nDemocratic senators coming out of the briefing slammed the Trump administration’s plan and warned many questions were left unanswered.\n\n“This is an insane plan. They are talking about stealing the Venezuelan oil at gunpoint for a period of time undefined as leverage to micromanage the country,” said Senator Chris Murphy. “The scope and insanity of that plan is absolutely stunning.”",

    "title": "5 unanswered questions about the 49ers ahead of the playoffs and any potential Super Bowl run",
    "description": "Answering questions about the 49ers on offense, defense, and special teams ahead of the playoffs",
    "fullText": "After a one-year hiatus, the San Francisco 49ers return to the playoffs. The regular season has been full of rollercoaster moments. The highs include thrilling victories over the Rams and Bears, while the lows feature losing two of the best players in the league at their respective positions.\n\nWe’ve learned a lot about Kyle Shanahan this year. Despite all the injuries the offense endured throughout the season, his scheme proved it can transcend the absence of star players. The 49ers were once again prolific offensively, finishing second in schedule-adjusted efficiency and third in success rate.\n\nIf the 49ers are going to make a playoff run, it’ll need to be on the backs of their offense. The defense showed some fight in Week 18, but the depth is depleted, and the margin for error no longer exists. Any drive that doesn’t result in points is a win for Robert Saleh.\n\nExpectations reset in the playoffs. What you did for 17 games doesn’t matter. It’s about which team executes for 50 minutes. With that in mind, let’s discuss five unanswered questions about the 49ers as they enter the playoffs.\n\nLooking at various numbers daily, the ones that show the most correlation with winning are passing success rate and generating explosive plays through the air. For the season, the 49ers finished third in passing success rate, at 53.1 percent. Since Week 11, the offense remained consistent, sitting third once more at 52.8 percent.\n\nThe 49ers’ offense was below league average this season in explosive play rate through the air, ranking 20th. They were much better in the final three games, ranking third, which is encouraging coming out of the bye week. Still, over the final 10 games, on a larger sample, the Niners were 20th.\n\nWeek 18 was a prime example of how difficult offense can be when you don’t generate explosives. The 49ers did it on one drive, and they quickly marched down the field and into the red zone. Outside of that drive, it was tough sledding for the offense.\n\nI’d expect Kyle Shanahan and his coaching staff to review the Week 13 matchup between the Eagles and the Chicago Bears and watch it closely, perhaps stealing some of the concepts involving motion.. Ben Johnson windrow dressed his way up and down the field, had Philadelphia’s second-level defenders confused, and found a way to control the game, despite only one explosive passing play. It’s possible, but it won’t be easy.\n\nThere are a couple of trains of thought when it comes to fourth-down decision-making. Before we share those, there is nothing more valuable in football than possessing the ball. The best chance you have to win in this league is when you have the ball.\n\nKnowing that, teams are either uber-aggressive on fourth down because they know their offense is potent and can pick up whatever yardage they need. Then there are the coaches with elite defenses. If you know your defense is stingy, then you can afford to go for it on fourth down because you understand there is a high probability that you get the ball back.\n\nIn Week 18, Shanahan punted the ball on 4th & 2 from San Francisco’s 43-yard line. In a game like that, where every possession is so valuable, the probability of you gaining two yards, retaining the ball, and going down to score was well worth being wrong about.\n\nThere was zero indication that your defense could get a stop up to that point. The Seahawks scored on their previous drive and reached 1st & goal at the 1-yard line on their first drive. The odds that you were going to prevent Seattle from getting to the 43 were slim. Sure enough, Shanahan punted.\n\nThe result worked out, as the Seahawks missed the field goal. However, that doesn’t feel like the right way to look at it. You still didn’t score, nor did the defense stop Seattle from getting to the yard where you punted.\n\nShanahan went for it on the next fourth down. The offense needed one yard. They didn’t convert. That doesn’t mean the decision to go was incorrect. On the ensuing drive, the defense had a free run at Sam Darnold. They should have ended the possession scoreless had Dee Winters sacked Darnold. They allowed a field goal, which works.\n\nHow aggressive will Shanahan be on fourth downs in the postseason? The strength of this team is on offense. Shanahan was correct more often than not during the regular season when it came time to go for it.\n\nAlmost every team is above 50% on correct decisions now.\n\nSharp contrast to a decade ago when only a couple teams would be > 50%.\n\nLook at Carroll/Vrabel! pic.twitter.com/9Q9grE5jdK\n\n— Computer Cowboy (@benbbaldwin) January 5, 2026\n\nThe 49ers are at their best when the offense is on the field. Even against a top defense like the Eagles, keeping the offense out there on fourth downs will give them the best chance to win.\n\nSaleh will put you in a position to make a play. The 49ers are short on talent defensively, but that doesn’t excuse the mental mistakes or missed tackles. The Niners had 23 missed tackles in Week 18, leading to 272 yards after contact.\n\nA.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith aren’t known for being YAC merchants, but they’re not easy to get on the ground. Neither is Dallas Goedert. Saquon Barkley had 759 yards after contact this season. The Eagles have playmakers who can make you look silly.\n\nThe 49ers’ secondary will be put in a position, time after time, in the playoffs to make a 1-on-1 tackle. Malik Mustapha has a broken+missed tackle percentage of 26 percent, which is the 18th-highest among all defensive backs in the NFL. Deommodore Lenoir sits at 22.8, and Ji’Ayir Brown is 22.2 percent.\n\nIt’s problematic when both of your safeties and the corner that you put in cloud coverage as the primary force defender are consistently missing tackles. That’s not on Saleh when his players are whiffing. He can’t tackle for them.\n\nYou can control tackling. It wouldn’t be surprising if the Niners started Eric Kendricks and Kyzir White this Sunday. Since Fred Warner went down, missed tackles at linebacker have been problematic. The Eagles’ offense has been bogged down all year. The last thing Saleh’s unit can afford to do is give them extra chances and free yards because of missed tackles.\n\nSeattle went 6-for-13 on third down, but went 0-for-3 in the red zone in Week 18. The Bears went 6-for-12 on third down, but were 1-for-3 in the red zone. The Colts were 5-for-10 on third downs and scored a touchdown on both of their red zone trips.\n\nTeams have no issues moving the ball on the 49ers’ defense. That’s been a given all season. The postseason success will come down to whether Saleh’s unit can get off the field on third downs or force field goals in the red zone.\n\nFor the season, the 49ers were 10th in opponent red zone touchdown scoring percentage at 53.7 percent and 50 percent during the final ten games. They were 21st in opponent third-down conversion rate, one spot behind the Eagles.\n\nIt comes back to possessing the ball. Your offense needs to be on the field. One way the 49ers’ defense can keep the offense in the game is by holding their opponent to three points or forcing a third-down stop before they reach field-goal range. It doesn’t have to be the majority of the time, either. A 40 percent third-down rate allowed should be plenty good.\n\nIn Week 18, Jake Moody missed a 24-yard field goal after doinking a kick off the upright. Eddy Pineiro’s one miss came at the end of the half from nearly 60 yards. Pineiro’s near-perfection will come in handy this postseason.\n\nThe 49ers’ opponent’s kicking percentage should also benefit them. Last year, teams kicking against the 49ers made 96 percent of their kicks. This season, it’s been a league-low 66.6 percent — nearly six percentage points better than the team in second place.\n\nThe 49ers finished the season ranked 13th in special teams DVOA. The Eagles were 24th. Thanks to Skyy Moore and Brian Robinson, San Francisco was fifth in kickoff returns. Flipping the field once in a playoff game would be huge for multiple reasons.\n\nSurprisingly, the Niners lead the league in hidden points on special teams. It’s something that has been dragging the team down, arguably every season under Shanahan. But this year it’s been one of the biggest strengths on a 12-win team.",

    "description": "The defense contractor said it plans to increase annual production of advanced Patriot missile interceptors from 600 to 2,000.",
    "fullText": "Lockheed Martin plans to dramatically ramp up production of Patriot missile interceptors, aiming to more than triple its annual output to 2,000, the defense contractor said on Tuesday.\n\nLockheed said that it had reached an agreement with the US Department of Defense to \"rapidly accelerate\" the production and delivery of its PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) interceptors over a seven-year period.\n\nThe new agreement will increase the annual production capacity of PAC-3, or Patriot Advanced Capability, interceptors from roughly 600 to 2,000. These will then be delivered to US, allied, and partner forces.\n\nGlobal demand for capable air defenses and interceptors has surged in recent years in response to the large missile attacks seen in Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine and in Middle East conflicts. The American-made MIM-104 Patriot air defense system has been at the center of both.\n\nThe surface-to-air missile system has served as the backbone of Ukraine's defense against Russian missile strikes, functioning as the top layer of an air defense network largely supported by Western-made technology. And the US military has relied on the Patriot to intercept Iranian attacks.\n\nThe high expenditure rate for Patriot interceptors over the last few years has raised concerns about future stockpiles for US and allied arsenals.\n\nJim Taiclet, Lockheed's chairman and CEO, said in a statement that the defense prime \"will create unprecedented capacity for PAC-3 MSE production, delivering at the speed our nation and allies demand.\"\n\nLockheed said that it had boosted PAC-3 MSE production by more than 60% over the past two years and delivered 620 missile interceptors in 2025, a 20% increase from 2024.\n\nThe contractor supplies 17 countries with its PAC-3 interceptors. It considers the MSE variant a \"cornerstone\" of US and European missile defense.\n\nThe Pentagon said that the agreement announced on Tuesday is a result of its new Acquisition Transformation Strategy, which Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth revealed in November and calls for increased production capacity for key weapons and munitions, among other priorities.\n\nHegseth said at the time that the Pentagon would award companies bigger and longer contracts for \"proven systems\" so that they could invest \n\nThe framework agreement announced on Tuesday \"establishes the basis for negotiating a seven-year supply contract\" that will still need Congressional approval, the Pentagon said.\n\n\"This framework agreement marks a fundamental shift in how we rapidly expand munitions production and magazine depth, and how we collaborate with our industry partners,\" said Michael Duffey, the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, in a statement.",

    "fullText": "Seven US service members were injured during the covert raid to apprehend Nicolás Maduro over the weekend, a defense official told Business Insider on Tuesday, sharing the latest update on their condition.\n\nFive of the wounded troops have already returned to duty, while two others are still recovering from their injuries, the official said.\n\n\"They are receiving excellent medical care and are well on their way to recovery,\" they said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump initially revealed Saturday morning, several hours after the operation had wrapped up, that \"a couple of guys were hit\" as US forces stormed Maduro's compound to apprehend Venezuela's now-former president and his wife, Cilia Flores.\n\nTrump later shared that all the injured service members were in \"good shape.\" He added that no US troops were killed, and no equipment was lost in this operation. A helicopter took a hit but remained operational.\n\n\"The fact that this extremely complex and grueling mission was successfully executed with so few injuries is a testament to the expertise of our joint warriors,\" the defense official said.\n\nIt's unclear what kind of injuries the troops sustained during the mission or how they were hurt. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, said on Monday that nearly 200 US personnel entered \"downtown Caracas\" as part of the operation.\n\nThe surprise US operation, called Absolute Resolve, followed months of extensive planning and rehearsal, including building a replica of Maduro's compound. On Saturday, Trump described the facility as a \"highly guarded\" building, \"like a fortress.\"\n\nLow-flying helicopters brough in apprehension teams, which included law enforcement officers and special operations forces, while dozens of other aircraft — from fighter jets and bombers to drones — cleared a path for them by striking Venezuela's air defenses.\n\nDan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters on Saturday that \"those in the air over Caracas last night were willing to give their lives for those on the ground and in the helicopters.\"\n\nAmerican forces stormed the compound under heavy fire. At some point during the operation, which began late Friday night and continued for several hours into Saturday morning, the troops were wounded. The US said everyone made it out though.\n\nDozens of Venezuelan and Cuban security personnel were killed during the US raid, according to the two militaries.",

According to The Advocate's Wilson Alexander, the Tigers are signing former Boise State safety Ty Benefield.\n\nBenefield is one of the top safeties in the portal. Per 247Sports, Benefield is the No. 33-ranked player available. The On3 Transfer Portal Industry Rankings consider Benefield top-10 at his position.\n\nBenefield brings a wealth of experience to LSU's defense, playing over 2,000 snaps in three years at Boise State. In 2025, he made 80 tackles and recorded 30 stops to go along with two interceptions and three pressures. In his career, he's racked up 71 stops, five interceptions, two forced fumbles, 15 pressures, and three sacks.\n\nBenefield is versatile. LSU returns TaMarcus Cooley and Da'Shawn Spears at safety, but LSU DC Blake Baker likes to play three safeties in his dime package. We could see Benefield assume the STAR role if LSU opts to play a traditional defensive back in that position with Harold Perkins off to the NFL.\n\nLSU is signing Boise State transfer safety Ty Benefield, a source confirmed with @theadvocatebr.

    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS (AP) — Nathan Chasing Horse, the former “Dances with Wolves” actor accused of sexual abuse, was temporarily thrown out of court Monday after he disrupted proceedings with demands he be allowed to fire his defense attorney a week before trial.\n\nJudge Jessica Peterson in Las Vegas ordered his jury trial to proceed next week as planned.\n\nChasing Horse has pleaded not guilty to 21 charges, including allegations that he sexually assaulted women and girls and that he filmed himself sexually abusing a girl younger than 14. Prosecutors allege he used his reputation as a spiritual leader and healer to take advantage of Native American women and girls over two decades.\n\nPeterson ordered him removed from court Monday for trying to speak over her. He argued that his attorney, Craig Mueller, did not come to visit him and did not file timely. He asked that a public defender who previously represented him be his attorney.\n\nMueller, a private defense attorney, told the court his client was ready and privately told the judge that one of his investigators had visited with Chasing Horse. He declined to comment to The Associated Press.\n\nBest known for portraying the character Smiles A Lot in the 1990 movie “Dances with Wolves,” Chasing Horse was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, which is home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.\n\nAfter starring in the Oscar-winning film, according to prosecutors, Chasing Horse began propping himself up as a self-proclaimed Lakota medicine man while traveling around North America to perform healing ceremonies. When he was arrested in 2023, he was living in a North Las Vegas house with his five wives, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe case sent shock waves across Indian Country. The original indictment was dismissed in 2024 after the Nevada Supreme Court ruled prosecutors abused the grand jury process when they provided a definition of grooming as evidence without any expert testimony. However, the court left open the possibility of charges being refiled, and a new indictment was brought later that year.\n\nProsecutors claim Chasing Horse led a cult called The Circle, and his followers believed he could speak with spirits. His victims went to him for medical help, according to a transcript from a grand jury hearing.\n\nProsecutors expect the trial to last three weeks. It is scheduled to begin Monday.",

After receiving the backing of team owner and President Mike Brown earlier in the day, head coach Zac Taylor voiced his support for Golden during a Jan. 5 news conference at Paycor Stadium and said he did not plan any staff changes.\n\nPersonnel-wise, there's plenty of business the Bengals can get done on the offensive side of the ball, including extending the contracts of players like 1,000-yard running Chase Brown. But the key offensive cogs are locked up for next year. There aren't any nagging contract situations that must be addressed, such as the past mega-deals for players like quarterback Joe Burrow and receivers Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins.\n\nMost of the other skill position players and offensive linemen are locked up contractually. And the one unsigned lineman many players would like to see return, and who has voiced interest in returning, is Dalton Risner. Risner confirmed his interest in returning to Cincinnati during a Jan. 4 interview with The Enquirer.\n\nOn the defensive side of the ball, there doesn't appear to be any lingering contract issues that would cast a pall on the offseason like Trey Hendrickson's did last year.\n\nIn short, the Bengals can pour much of their focus into the defense, which ended 2025 ranked No. 31 out of 32 teams in total defense.\n\n\"That’s the truth of it. There’s no real sugarcoating that. You got a bunch of (defensive) guys coming back,\" Taylor said. \"It’s exciting because you can focus your energy. There’s so many guys on that side of the ball that, really, their growth was accelerated over the last half of the year. You are really excited about their future here as starters (and) as role players. I feel like we are in a tremendous position going into this offseason.\n\n\"Our expectations are going to be sky high, and we are going to work like heck to meet those expectations. I think the players and coaches all see the direction we are headed. So there is a lot of positive energy heading into the offseason.\"\n\nTaylor on Jan. 5 continued to trumpet the statistical defensive improvement under Golden following Cincinnati's Nov. 9 bye week, although the team went 3-5 during that stretch and lost three one-score games. Bengals' offensive turnovers leading to opposition touchdowns also played a role in several of those games. Golden's unit didn't have much to do with those moments.\n\nTaylor also offered insight into a shorter runway for Golden to onboard with the Bengals following his run as Notre Dame's defensive coordinator for the College Football Playoff. That run ran all the way through to the National Championship game in Atlanta on Jan. 20, 2025. The Bengals then hired Golden and started to take meaningful steps in assembling the defensive coaching staff around him.\n\nThere were times it felt like the Bengals were one missed tackle or one play of some kind from winning. Instead, they more often than not let those games get away. Several players on Jan. 5 said they viewed that perspective as evidence the team is close.\n\nSimilarly, Taylor said he believed the defense was close to being where he needed it to be.\n\n\"I think that staff really worked hard to come together and get on the same page with scheme and how we're going to coach these guys,\" Taylor said. \"So, like anything, I saw great growth from that side of the ball. And they closed (by) giving up 18 points or something a game over the last eight games. And there's a lot of statistics I can read where it shows marked improvement. And so again, I like the direction that group is headed. I like the direction our team is headed. I know how it sounds when we come off the record we just had, but again, I've got a lot of excitement, and I'm excited to get back to work and get these guys ready for next year.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Zac Taylor said no Bengals' coaching staff changes are planned",

    "description": "Small drones are \"the defining threat of our time,\" Brig. Gen. Ross said, requiring a layered defense network to stop them.",
    "fullText": "The US military is racing to develop better defenses against drones, but there's no silver bullet, no wonder weapon, that will single-handedly defeat everything, the commander of the Pentagon's new counter-drone force said.\n\nJoint Interagency Task Force 401 says stopping drones isn't about one weapon or system. The counter-drone fight will require a mix of different tools, from ways to physically shoot down drones to electronic and other non-kinetic solutions.\n\nIt also demands easier, faster processes for testing and buying systems across the services.\n\nThe task force was created last fall to expedite counter-drone technologies across the Department of Defense, replacing the Joint Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office, which was established in 2019. Since its establishment, the task force has assessed and contributed to the US military's counter-drone arsenal, including forces at home and abroad.\n\nBut there's no one system they've found that can stop small uncrewed aerial systems, or UAS, which the task force's commander, Brig. Gen. Matt Ross, called \"the defining threat of our time.\"\n\n\"There's no silver bullet for counter-UAS. There's just not,\" Ross said last month at a media roundtable. \"If there was, we would already have it,\" he added.\n\nInstead, the task force is focused on a suite of technologies for layered, integrated protection from drones. \"Our formations must be able to detect, track, identify, and defeat these systems anywhere on the planet,\" Ross said. \"This requires us to layer our defenses by integrating sensors with kinetic and non-kinetic effectors and battle management systems into a responsive, interoperable network.\"\n\nHe said that many defense technologies already exist for countering medium-sized drones, which the Pentagon classifies as Group 3, but more work remains in smaller drones under Group 1 and 2, UAS such as the quadcopters that dominate in Ukraine.\n\nAnd the counter-drone problem isn't just about what systems are needed to protect service members and civilians. \"The technology is not going to solve this problem for us. We can't field a system that will stop every drone. It will all come down to the installation commander or the person responsible for that site and how they use the tools that we provide them,\" Ross said.\n\nIn its first 100 days, the task force has identified a key goal: creating a shared command-and-control system that makes it easier for different teams and regions to share data. It also wants to build a marketplace where the military services, law enforcement, and other agencies can find counter-drone systems suited to their specific threats, review performance data and user feedback, and potentially buy those systems in one place.\n\nThe task force notably isn't operating in isolation. There's overlap between the task force's focus on stopping Group 3 drones, systems like Shield AI's V-BAT or the Army's AAI RQ-7, and the responsibilities of the Golden Dome missile defense project, which has to include defenses for Group 3 drones.\n\nThe task force plans to share data with the Golden Dome project, and Ross said he's currently discussing what that looks like with Space Force's Gen. Michael Guetlein.\n\nAnother priority for the task force is helping protect against small drones at major events, including the FIFA World Cup this year, with matches set to be held at 11 large stadiums in cities across the US.\n\nRoss said that based on US forces overseas, \"we're heavily indexed against Group 3 systems, and those are larger systems that fly a longer distance and carry heavier payloads. And I want to make sure that we have just as robust protection against Group 1 and Group 2 systems that are smaller and much more likely to be seen over a widely attended gathering, stadium, or a watch party specifically for the World Cup.\"",

    "description": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday announced that he is issuing a letter of censure to Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona over the lawmaker’s participation in a video that called on troops to resist unlawful orders.  Hegseth said that the censure was “a necessary process step” to proceedings that could result in a demotion from Kelly's retired rank of captain in the U.S. Navy.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday announced that he is issuing a letter of censure to Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona over the lawmaker’s participation in a video that called on troops to resist unlawful orders.\n\nHegseth said that the censure was “a necessary process step” to proceedings that could result in a demotion from Kelly's retired rank of captain in the U.S. Navy.\n\nIn a lengthy post on X, Kelly said he “never expected” what he called an “attack” from Trump and Hegseth, recounting his 25 years of Navy service, as well as combat and space missions. Calling Hegseth's move “outrageous” and “un-American,” Kelly said he would fight the censure “with everything I’ve got — not for myself, but to send a message back that Pete Hegseth and Donald Trump don’t get to decide what Americans in this country get to say about their government.”\n\nThe move comes more than a month after Kelly participated in a video with five other Democratic lawmakers in which they called on troops to defy “illegal orders.” President Donald Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition “punishable by DEATH” in a social media post days later.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York called Hegseth’s action against Kelly “a despicable act of political retribution.”\n\n“Mark Kelly is a hero and a patriot committed to serving the American people,” Schumer said on social media. “Pete Hegseth is a lap dog committed to serving one man – Donald Trump.”\n\nIn November, Kelly and the other lawmakers — all veterans of the armed services and intelligence community — called on U.S. military members to uphold the Constitution and defy “illegal orders.”\n\nThe 90-second video was first posted from Sen. Elissa Slotkin’s X account. In it, the six lawmakers — Slotkin, Kelly and Reps. Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander and Chrissy Houlahan — speak directly to U.S. service members, whom Slotkin acknowledges are “under enormous stress and pressure right now.”\n\nThe Pentagon announced that it began an investigation of Kelly late in November while citing a federal law that allows retired service members to be recalled to active duty on orders of the defense secretary for possible court martial or other measures.\n\nWhile all six lawmakers served in the military or the intelligence community, Hegseth made clear in previous remarks that Kelly was the only one facing investigation because he is the only one of the lawmakers who formally retired from the military and is still under the Pentagon’s jurisdiction.\n\nKelly said that the investigation was part of an effort to silence dissent within the military.\n\n“This is just about sending a message to retired service members, active duty service members, government employees — do not speak out against this president or there will be consequences,” Kelly told reporters in mid-December.\n\nIn his post Monday, Hegseth charged that Kelly's remarks in the video and afterward violated the Uniform Code of Military Justice provisions against conduct unbecoming an officer and violating good order and discipline.\n\nKelly, along with some of the other Democrats in the initial video, have also sent out fundraising messages based off the Republican president’s reaction to their comments, efforts that have gone toward filling their own campaign coffers and further elevating their national-level profiles.\n\nIn recent months, Kelly — whose name has frequently been mentioned as a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender — has made several trips to South Carolina, traditionally an early primary state that kicked off its party’s nominating calendar in 2024. Appearing with his wife, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, at events calling for stricter gun control measures, Kelly met during those trips with local lawmakers, stakeholders whose early support can be critical as national-level hopefuls attempt to make inroads in the critical state.\n\nHegseth said Monday that “Captain Kelly’s status as a sitting United States Senator does not exempt him from accountability, and further violations could result in further action.\"\n\nTodd Huntley, a retired Navy captain and judge advocate general, said that this is a “novel” situation that raises legal questions.\n\nOne issue, according to Huntley, is whether Kelly’s comments fall under the constitutional protections of the speech or debate clause.\n\nThe clause is intended to protect members of Congress from questioning about official legislative acts, and a 1968 Supreme Court decision wrote that the provision’s intent was “to prevent legislative intimidation by and accountability to the other branches of government.”\n\nHuntley also said that while the type of process Hegseth is using here, known as a retirement grade determination, is fairly routine, “as far as I know, they’ve always been based on conduct during the individual’s active duty service, even if it only came to light after retirement.”\n\n“So, I don’t know if conduct totally after retirement would fit the requirement for such a determination,” he added.\n\nAccording to Hegseth, Kelly now has 30 days to submit a response to the proceedings that will decide if he is demoted. The decision will be made within 45 days, Hegseth’s post added.\n\nKinnard reported from Columbia, S.C. Associated Press writer Stephen Groves contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) — President Donald Trump on Sunday told reporters that U.S. officials have determined that Ukraine did not target a residence belonging to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a drone attack last week, disputing Kremlin claims that Trump had initially greeted with deep concern.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov last week said Ukraine launched a wave of drones at Putin’s state residence in the northwestern Novgorod region that the Russian defense systems were able to defeat. Lavrov also criticized Kyiv for launching the attack at a moment of intensive negotiations to end the war.\n\nThe allegation came just a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had traveled to Florida for talks with Trump on the U.S. administration's still-evolving 20-point plan aimed at ending the war. Zelenskyy quickly denied the Kremlin allegation.\n\nTrump said that “something happened nearby” Putin's residence but that Americans officials didn't find the Russian president's residence was targeted.\n\n“I don’t believe that strike happened,\" Trump told reporters as he traveled back to Washington on Sunday after spending two weeks at his home in Florida. “We don't believe that happened, now that we've been able to check.”\n\nTrump addressed the U.S. determination after European officials argued that the Russian claim was nothing more than an effort by Moscow to undermine the peace effort.\n\nBut Trump, at least initially, had appeared to take the Russian allegations at face value. He told reporters last Monday that Putin had also raised the matter during a phone he had with the Russian leader earlier that day. And Trump said he was “very angry” about the accusation.\n\nThe U.S. president has struggled to fulfill a pledge to quickly end the war in Ukraine and has shown irritation with both Zelenskyy and Putin as he tried to mediate an end to a conflict he boasted on the campaign trail that he could end in one day.\n\nBoth Trump and Zelenskyy said last week they made progress in their talks at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nBut Putin has shown little interest in ending the war until all of Russia's objectives are met, including winning control of all Ukrainian territory in the key industrial Donbas region and imposing severe restrictions on the size of Ukraine's post-war military and the type of weaponry it can possess.\n\nMadhani reported from Washington.",

    "description": "Patria, Finland's biggest defense contractor, is scaling up production as it deals with an order backlog of over 1,000 vehicles from NATO allies.",
    "fullText": "Alarms blare over the factory floors, and work at Patria's Hämeenlinna facility grinds to a halt.\n\nThe soft thrum of an explosion echoes through the campus. Moments later, roughly 700 workers continue making their armored vehicles bound for Japan, Sweden, Slovakia, and other countries. The blast is not a test-firing of its new combat vehicle, but part of the construction for its expanding manufacturing facility.\n\nPatria, Finland's largest defense company, is planning to nearly double production at its main hub just north of Helsinki, clearing rocks with explosives on-site to make way for several new assembly lines.\n\nThe Hämeenlinna factory manufactures Patria's 8×8 armored personnel carrier and a relatively new, up-and-coming vehicle: a wheeled 6×6 troop transport that's receiving surging demand from northern and western Europe.\n\nWork on the 25-foot-long, 17-ton vehicle began in 2020 under a joint program between Finland and Latvia called the Common Armored Vehicles System. Both countries sought a cost-effective, mass-produced armored vehicle that could be used by their militaries for interoperability.\n\nLatvia has since sent at least 42 of these vehicles to Ukraine, armed with heavy machine guns and rolled out in batches over the last year. The vehicle can cross tundra and even rivers while shielding up to 10 troops it carries from land mines and artillery fire to get them to forward positions.\n\nWhen Business Insider visited Patria's factory, representatives for the company — which is majority-owned by the state of Finland — said the firm wasn't authorized to share details about the 6×6's performance in Ukraine.\n\nBut the CAVS 6×6 program has been quickly drawing attention from the rest of Europe: What began as a partnership between two countries has expanded into a consortium of seven member states.\n\nSweden joined the Common Armored Vehicles System program in 2022, followed by Germany, Denmark, the UK, and Norway in subsequent years.\n\nFinland and Latvia have placed orders for just under 500 of these vehicles, while Sweden has requested 415 of the 6×6s to be delivered over the next five years. Stockholm's latest order for 94 vehicles, announced in early December, priced each one at about $1.75 million.\n\nGermany has become the program's largest buyer, signing contracts in mid-December to acquire 876 of the 6×6 vehicles, valued at $2.3 billion. These vehicles will be split into four variants, including one that features a mortar turret.\n\nMeanwhile, Denmark, which joined the program this year, has already placed an order for 129 6×6 vehicles.\n\nThe UK and Norway are still negotiating 6×6 orders with Patria.\n\nThe CAVS 6×6 can accommodate roughly 10 troops, along with a typical crew of two or three, and features up to NATO standard level 4 armor designed to withstand direct hits from large-caliber machine gun fire, mine explosions, and nearby artillery blasts.\n\nThe CAVS 6×6 competes with other wheeled troop transports, such as Rheinmetall's Boxer and General Dynamics Land Systems' Stryker, the latter of which is extensively fielded by the US Army.\n\nThe Finnish company said it can tweak the vehicle for each customer's needs, but a typical model features climate control that enables the vehicle to operate in temperatures as low as -40°F.\n\n\"Inside, it will be comfortable enough to easily survive. We are talking about temperatures of the plus centigrades,\" Mikko Rantanen, Patria's director for 6×6 vehicle programs, told Business Insider from inside the rear compartment of one of the vehicles.\n\nThe 6×6's rear interior is spartan: Cloth-covered metal-frame seats and headrests for five people on either side, with space behind each seat for equipment and small arms.\n\nThere's just enough room for a soldier to sit with their knees touching the opposite passenger's. A few fire extinguishers inside are connected to an automatic suppression system that can detect a blaze in the rear cabin.\n\nScreens allow troops to see outside the vehicle through exterior cameras, while a rear hatch provides the option of fitting a machine gun or crewed weapon module on top of the 6×6.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the vehicle, a small passageway also lets troops pass between the rear compartment and the driver's cabin, which resembles that of a truck and features an automatic gearbox.\n\nOptional propellers on the 6×6's underside enable it to transition seamlessly from traversing land to crossing small bodies of water, such as rivers or lakes.\n\n\"We can enter the water without needing preparation in this configuration,\" said Rantanen.\n\nHowever, the 6×6's speed in the water is just under 5 mph, and Rantanen added that it's not meant to be a landing craft or amphibious assault vehicle.\n\nOn land, it's designed to drive at speeds of over 60 mph, easily cross trenches that are four feet wide, and surmount obstacles about two feet high.\n\nBuilding weapons and vehicles specifically for arctic terrain is a specialty for contractors in Finland, a country renowned for holding off the Soviet Union for over 100 days in deep snow and dense forest during World War II.\n\nPatria said that while the 6×6 can be outfitted for various terrain types, including the desert, the arctic domain is its forte.\n\nSnow isn't the only challenge in arctic warfare. Few roads are available on Finland's border with Russia — the priority threat for NATO — and its vast hinterland is peppered with thousands of small lakes and marshland that can bog down armored transport.\n\n\"In the wintertime, it's snow,\" said Petri Hepola, Patria's executive vice president for sales and marketing and its chief program officer for the F-35. \"In the summer, lots of wet soil and swampy areas. One of the most important features is how fast you can move your troops and tools through these areas.\"\n\nFinland and Norway are the only two members of Patria's 6×6 program that share Arctic borders with Russia.\n\nHowever, as northern Europe, especially the Baltic and Nordic states, grows increasingly concerned about conflict with Moscow, the Kremlin has been bolstering its military presence in the high north, repopulating key bases and transforming its Arctic fleet into a separate strategic theater.\n\nSince Finland joined NATO in 2023, alliance forces have been rushing to train on the country's terrain and frigid temperatures, making it one of the most active spots for joint exercises in recent years.\n\n\"Our products have been surviving very well in that environment,\" Hepola said.\n\nWith an order backlog of nearly 2,000 6×6 vehicles, Patria hopes its new facility in Hämeenlinna will be ready for production by 2027. The factory campus serves only the tail end of the entire manufacturing cycle, which can take weeks in most cases, or several months for more complicated variants.\n\nInside, hundreds of workers conduct welding, surface treatment, assembly, tests, and other final processes that can each take weeks to complete. Dozens of vehicles line the factory floors, and dozens more sit in parking lots, each marked with a flag to designate the country for which it has been modified.\n\nBefore delivery, each one is supposed to be driven at least 200 km, or 124 miles.\n\nRantanen, director of the 6×6 program, said Patria has been integrating counter-drone systems, such as jammers, on the vehicle.\n\nArmored vehicles in Ukraine have especially struggled against pervasive minefields and small drones with explosive payloads, some of which are controlled via a fiber optic cable connection that can't be jammed. In response, soldiers there have relied more on firearms such as shotguns and machine guns to counter such attacks.\n\nRantanen said Patria hasn't yet officially added any kinetic weapons that can take down drones.\n\n\"The drone threat is currently evolving at such a speed that it's hard to keep track of it closely,\" he said. \"But we are hard at work for the countermeasures against drones as well.\"",

    "fullText": "The New York Jets will play their Week 18 finale versus the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.\n\nIt'll represent the last showing for a defense that must undergo a serious identity makeover in the offseason. Head coach Aaron Glenn will hire a new defensive coordinator. General manager Darren Mougey will also be tasked with acquiring more talented playmakers on defense. They are heavily outmatched heading into Sunday.\n\nUntil then, we've identified three potential X-factors for the Jets defense in Week 18.\n\nJermaine Johnson II hasn't recorded a sack in his latest six appearances. It's been tough sledding for the pass rusher who returned from a 2024 season-ending torn Achilles injury. Johnson continues playing with effort, so it would be nice to see him finish the season with a breakthrough.\n\nInterim defensive coordinator Chris Harris recently heaped praise on linebacker Jamien Sherwood. Sherwood leads the Jets in tackles by a longshot with 147 takedowns this season. Despite it being a lost season, he continues to compete to his full capabilities.\n\nVeteran defensive tackle Harrison Phillips has been a limited participant at practice this week. That indicates he's trending towards being available for Sunday's finale. The Jets need Phillips' run-stopping efforts against Josh Allen and James Cook.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: New York Jets vs. Buffalo Bills: 3 X-factors on defense for Week 18",

    "fullText": "No. 5 Purdue Boilermakers has revenge on its mind as it opens the new year against the Wisconsin Badgers.\n\nDespite being favored, the Boilermakers have lost their last two to Wisconsin and three straight to the Badgers ATS. In fact, Wisconsin has ATS wins in six of the last seven over Purdue as underdogs.\n\nWisconsin, meanwhile, needs an impressive win after losing to highly ranked foes in the non-conference schedule.\n\nOur Purdue vs. Wisconsin predictions and college basketball picks believe the Boilermakers will get what they want, covering on the road.\n\nPurdue vs Wisconsin best bet: Purdue -5.5 (-115)\n\nThe 12-1 Purdue Boilermakers have the most efficient offense in the nation. Since an early-December loss to Iowa State, Purdue has also stepped up its defense.\n\nAgainst the four opponents since then — a list that includes Quad I Auburn, as well as Minnesota and Marquette — Purdue has not allowed more than 60 points.\n\nThe Boilermakers held all four to fewer than .93 points per possession. After allowing teams to shoot .495 from two and .321 from three through the Iowa State game, Purdue has allowed opponents a .422 rate from two and .259 from three.\n\nAs a result, they've won all four games by between 28 and 51 points.\n\nThat means Purdue has more Quad I wins in the last four games — and as many power-conference wins — as the Wisconsin Badgers have managed all season.\n\nThe Badgers are 0-3 against Quad I foes, 0-4 if you consider that TCU was Quad I when it won by 11, only to slip to Quad II since.\n\nWisconsin failed to cover all four games and lost them all by double digits, including a 28-point loss to BYU and a 30-point defeat at Nebraska.\n\nWisconsin has been middle-of-the-road in most defensive measures, which already spells doom in the Big Ten.\n\nHowever, against elite teams, that defense slips to downright awful. The Badgers rank No. 172 in the nation, allowing foes to shoot .334 from three.\n\nTheir four top-shelf opponents shot .403. From the two-point range, Wisconsin shoots 49.6%, No. 114 in the country. Their four best foes shot .521.\n\nPurdue plays at the No. 309-ranked tempo in the nation. In their last 10 head-to-head matchups, Purdue and Wisconsin have had an Over/Under points line of 150.5 once.\n\nPurdue has gone Under in five of its last six games, including three times with an Over/Under below 153.5. Wisconsin has been under in the last two games and three of the previous four.\n\nNolan Winter has scored in double figures in six straight and averaged 18.3 in his last three. He scored 14 against BYU and 23 against Villanova, so he's not just bullying mid-major big men.\n\nFletcher Loyer is Purdue's leading scorer, but he's been a bit of a bully this season, piling on the points against low-level foes.\n\nMeanwhile, his four lowest-scoring games came against Purdue’s Quad I opponents: 7 points vs. Alabama, 10 vs. Texas Tech, 5 vs. Iowa State, and 8 vs. Auburn.\n\nFletcher Loyer Under 13.5 points\n\nSpread: Purdue -8.5 (-110) | Wisconsin +8.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Purdue -265 | Wisconsin +225\n\nOver/Under: Over 153.5 (-105) | Under 153.5 (-115)\n\nPurdue has hit the game total Under in nine of its last 12 road games.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump, 79, fired off an early-morning tirade Friday insisting he is in “PERFECT HEALTH” as concerns grow over his apparent mental and physical decline.\n\n“The White House Doctors have just reported that I am in ‘PERFECT HEALTH,’ and that I ‘ACED’ (Meaning, was correct on 100% of the questions asked!), for the third straight time, my Cognitive Examination, something which no other President, or previous Vice President, was willing to take,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n“P.S., I strongly believe that anyone running for President, or Vice President, should be mandatorily forced to take a strong, meaningful, and proven Cognitive Examination. Our great Country cannot be run by ‘STUPID’ or INCOMPETENT PEOPLE!”\n\nTrump has routinely brushed aside suggestions he is in mental decline by boasting about passing the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, a test used to detect cognitive impairment or early signs of dementia. The test involves tasks such as drawing a clock to show a specific time and identifying animals.\n\nDuring a December 2025 speech in North Carolina, Trump also proudly told the crowd how he “aced” such a test.\n\n“The first question is like, ‘What is this?’ And they show a lion, a giraffe, a fish, and a hippopotamus. And they say, ‘Which is the giraffe?’” Trump said.\n\n“I don’t think Joe [Biden] would have gotten the first question right,” he added. “He would say hippo. ‘I want the hippo,’”\n\nThe Daily Beast has been leading the way in reporting on concerns about the president’s health, including frequently documenting how Trump covers large bruises on his hands with makeup and tries to conceal his swollen cankles whenever possible.\n\nIn a remarkably candid interview with The Wall Street Journal published Jan. 1, Trump—the oldest sitting president in U.S. history—was forced to address his health issues and, in doing so, he contradicted previous assurances given to the public.\n\nHe revealed that his second medical exam last year at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center involved a CT scan, not an MRI as previously disclosed. Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, Trump’s physician who conducted the exam, told the Journal that the CT scan was performed to “definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues.”\n\nThe White House confirmed in July 2025 that Trump had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a condition that causes swelling in the lower legs.\n\nTrump told the Journal that he briefly wore compression socks to help with his cankles but stopped because he did not like them. The president also made the startling admission that he takes more aspirin than his doctors recommend for “cardiac prevention.”\n\n“They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don’t want thick blood pouring through my heart,” Trump said. “I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart. Does that make sense?”\n\nTrump blamed the frequent bruising on his hands—which he desperately attempts to conceal with concealer—on his heavy daily aspirin use.\n\nFor months, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has offered a boilerplate response when the Daily Beast asked about the bruises, insisting they are the result of the president “meeting more Americans and shaking their hands on a daily basis than any other president in history.”\n\nTrump also admitted he is so fragile that his hand bled after Attorney General Pam Bondi nicked him with her ring during a high five at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July 2024.\n\n“The ring hit the back of my hand, and, yes, there was a slight little cut,” Trump told the Journal of the incident, which reportedly caused alarm among members of his inner circle.\n\nTrump said he applies makeup to his hands whenever he gets “whacked again.”\n\n“I have makeup that’s, you know, easy to put on. Takes about 10 seconds,” he said.",

Mora will be the third CSU head coach Summers has been defensive coordinator for.\n\nSummers was hired by Jay Norvell ahead of the 2025 season and then took over as CSU interim coach when Norvell was fired in October. Summers also served as CSU's defensive coordinator in 2015 under Mike Bobo.\n\nThe Rams finished 2025 second-to-last in the Mountain West in scoring defense (30.8 points per game allowed) and last in total defense (426 yards per game allowed) as the injury-ravaged unit struggled.\n\nHe came back to CSU after three seasons as Western Kentucky’s defensive coordinator, where the Hilltoppers were one of the top teams in forcing turnovers.\n\nWestern Kentucky ranked ninth nationally in pass defense in 2024.

    "fullText": "The Pittsburgh Steelers’ defense has slipped this season in its second year under Teryl Austin as age and injuries have caught up to the unit, but one player who hasn’t is Joey Porter Jr.\n\nPorter has stepped up in his third season, picking up the slack and setting career highs in several categories after struggling last year. He has personal bests in passes defended and sacks despite playing the fewest games of his career thus far.\n\nHe’s also done a great job of keeping opponents out of the end zone. He hasn’t allowed a touchdown on his last 1,011 coverage snaps — the longest active streak in the NFL.\n\nJoey Porter Jr has not allowed a TD in his last 1,011 coverage snaps\n\nThe longest active streak in the NFL\n\nThe 25-year-old has emerged as one of the league’s better cornerbacks and is making a strong case for a contract extension from the Steelers, who desperately need to get younger and faster on defense. Porter, whose father starred for Pittsburgh two decades ago, fits the bill.\n\nThe Steelers already have the most expensive defense in the NFL, but Porter deserves a raise and would be worth the investment. He should still have several good years in front of him and will be eligible for a contract extension this offseason.\n\nPorter is one of several extension candidates this offseason for Pittsburgh, although the front office may opt to invest \n\nMore Steelers: Can Steelers’ Surging Defense Stop Ravens’ Elite Run Offense?\n\nThe post Steelers Defender Making Strong Case For Contract Extension With Mind-Blowing Streak appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "description": "Can Jordan Magee replace Bobby Wagner in the middle of the Commanders' defense in 2026? That's a key offseason question.",
    "fullText": "The Washington Commanders have plenty of holes to fill this upcoming offseason. While Washington needs to add another starting receiver, perhaps a tight end, and a running back, the Commanders have their quarterback and an offensive line to build around.\n\nIt's another story on defense. Washington needs plenty of help. Fortunately, the Commanders have the cap space to be active in free agency and a top-seven pick in the 2026 NFL draft to help improve the defense.\n\nOne question GM Adam Peters and head coach Dan Quinn must resolve before the offseason begins is how many young defenders can step into a starting role next season? One name comes to mind: linebacker Jordan Magee.\n\nThe second-year linebacker from Temple has seen increased snaps on defense this season. Magee has played in every game for Washington this season, making seven starts. With the Commanders using Frankie Luvu more as a pass rusher, Magee has played alongside Bobby Wagner at linebacker. Magee has flashed numerous times in 2025, as his speed is something Washington lacks on defense.\n\nWhen the Commanders selected Magee in the 2024 NFL draft, they reportedly liked him as the heir apparent to the future Hall of Famer Wagner. Unfortunately, Magee hasn't had any snaps at Mike linebacker to see if he could handle that role full-time in 2026.\n\nHead coach Dan Quinn was asked about Magee is ready for that responsibility.\n\nThe part that you want to do is like, how do you train somebody into that space?\" Quinn said this week. \"And some of it is, in practice, you have a number of them that can have it on, so they're hearing my communication. So, what we would never want is on the first time you heard it, like, 'Oh, that's what Dan sounds like, or that's what it sounds like.' And so, you go through that process in the practice. So, when he takes his reps in the practice, when if he was with the second or the third group, it's the same exact process that I would do with Wags, 'Hey, this down in distance, remind this player alert for this.' So, there's a little bit of directing that comes of it.\"\n\nWith Washington long out of contention, fans have wanted to see Magee replace Wagner. That's not the right decision. Wagner remains one of the Commanders' top defensive players, despite his struggles in coverage. The ideal scenario would be limiting his snaps. It would not only help keep Wagner fresh, but also give the staff an evaluation of how Magee handles playing inside.\n\nQuinn offered even more details on Magee playing inside.\n\n\"Think if you were a quarterback in the huddle and you want to give one more reminder before you broke out to somebody, you would tell them that that's sometimes what I'm telling that person to do into that spot and then going in, you want to find out did they do it in college and signals and now it'll be different I suppose because that's been an additional thing that they're doing that we haven't done before,\" he said. \"But just the leading part of it, I think that's the big thing, the vocal part of it. Doesn't mean you have to be loud and rah rah, but you have to be somebody that can take command, that can give information quickly. And not all linebackers can do that.\"\n\nThat's a thorough answer. Was Quinn telling us something about Magee without actually saying it? It's clear he likes him. The Commanders see Magee as a part of their future, but that doesn't necessarily mean playing inside.\n\nWagner is 35 and a free agent at season's end. With so many holes to fix on defense, don't count on the Commanders handing the position to Magee full-time in 2026 without knowing if he's ready for it. Whose fault is that?\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Can Jordan Magee replace Bobby Wagner in 2026?",

    "fullText": "TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te on Thursday vowed to defend the self-ruled island’s sovereignty in the face of China’s “expansionist ambitions,” days after Beijing wrapped up live-fire military drills near its shores.\n\n“In the face of China’s rising expansionist ambitions, the international community is watching to see whether the Taiwanese people have the resolve to defend themselves,” Lai said in his New Year’s address.\n\n“As president, my stance has always been clear: to firmly safeguard national sovereignty, strengthen national defense and the resilience of the whole society, and comprehensively construct an effective deterrence and democratic defense mechanism,” he added.\n\nLai’s comments came days after China wrapped up live-fire drills around Taiwan featuring rocket launches, aircraft and warships. Beijing had expressed anger at a planned U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, as well as at Japan’s new leader’s comments that Tokyo could intervene in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan.\n\nChina sees Taiwan as its own territory and threatens to annex it by force if necessary. A former Japanese colony, Taiwan has been governed independently from the mainland since 1949, when the Nationalist Party lost a civil war against the Chinese Communist Party and retreated to the island.\n\nLai's speech was met angrily in Beijing, where a spokesperson for the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office called the president “a saboteur of peace, a troublemaker and a warmonger,” according to the official Xinhua news agency.\n\n“No matter what Lai and the Democratic Progressive Party authorities say or do, they cannot change the fact that Taiwan is part of China,\" said spokesperson Chen Binhua.\n\nThe planned arms sale, valued at more than $11 billion, is the U.S.’s largest so far to Taiwan. It includes missiles, drones, artillery systems and military software.\n\nThe United States is obligated by its own laws to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.\n\nChina’s leader Xi Jinping called Taiwan’s eventual annexation “ unstoppable \" during his own televised New Year’s address on Wednesday.\n\nTaiwan last year announced a special $40 billion budget for arms purchases, including to build an air defense system with high-level detection and interception capabilities called the Taiwan Dome.\n\nThe budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033, and comes after Lai already pledged to raise defense spending to 5% of the island’s GDP, as part of his strategy amid China’s threats of invasion.\n\n“Facing China’s serious military ambitions, Taiwan has no time to wait,” Lai said.\n\nMistreanu reported from Beijing.",

I felt like I let myself down and most importantly my teammates down.\n\n\"With that being said, after lots of talks with my family and close ones, I will be returning to Penn State for my senior year,\" Rojas confirmed. \"I'm ready to finish what me and my teammates started and am ready to flip this thing and tell an incredible story with Coach Campbell and his new staff.\"\n\nRojas was one of the rising stars on the defense since his arrival with the program but he suffered what turned out to be a season-ending injury during the 2025 season. His loss from the roster fell in line with the rapid decline of Penn State's season with UCLA being the first team to take full advantage of a Rojas-less Penn State defense. Penn State went on to lose the next four games after that UCLA loss (Northwestern, Iowa, Ohio State, and Indiana) as the defense worked to fix some concerns it had.\n\nPenn State does have a few linebackers choosing to enter the transfer portal, likely resulting in their pending departure from the program. Karui Jackson, Keon Wylie, and Anthony Speca have all reportedly entered the transfer portal.\n\nFollow Kevin McGuire on Threads, Bluesky, Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook.\n\nFollow Nittany Lions Wire on X, Facebook, and Threads.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nittany Lions Wire: Penn State LB Tony Rojas announces decision for 2026",

    "fullText": "PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — Fernando Mendoza threw three touchdown passes, Indiana’s defense thoroughly throttled Alabama, and the top-seeded Hoosiers roared into the College Football Playoff semifinals with a 38-3 victory in the 112th Rose Bowl on Thursday.\n\nMendoza passed for 192 yards in his first game since winning his school’s first Heisman Trophy, but the hard-nosed Hoosiers (14-0, No. 1 CFP seed) won the Rose Bowl for the first time in school history by dominating the Crimson Tide (11-4, No. 9 CFP seed) at the line of scrimmage.\n\nIndiana scored the game’s first 24 points before pouring it on with fourth-quarter rushing TDs from Kaelon Black and Roman Hemby, wrapping up a jubilant win in the 112th edition of the Granddaddy of Them All.\n\nCharlie Becker, Omar Cooper Jr. and Elijah Sarratt caught TD passes, while Black rushed for 99 yards. Indiana outgained Alabama 407-193, steadily delighting a decidedly pro-Indiana crowd that celebrated its long-struggling team’s first Rose Bowl game appearance since 1968 with chants of “Hoosier Daddy?” in the final minutes.\n\nIndiana had not won any bowl game since the Copper Bowl in 1991, but history has been no match for Curt Cignetti and his dominant Hoosiers during the coach’s two transcendent seasons.\n\nThe Hoosiers are headed to the Peach Bowl on Jan. 9 for a CFP semifinal rematch with fifth-seeded Oregon, which routed Texas Tech 23-0 earlier Thursday in the Orange Bowl. Indiana beat the then-No. 3 Ducks 30-20 in Eugene last October in one of Cignetti’s most impressive Big Ten victories.\n\nIndiana is two wins away from the first national championship in school history after becoming the first team to advance following a first-round bye in the current 12-team playoff format. The first six bye teams — including the first two this season — couldn’t come back strong from an extra-long layoff, but the Hoosiers took care of business while improving to 25-2 under Cignetti.\n\nThe Crimson Tide’s second season under Kalen DeBoer ended in the same venue as their final season under Nick Saban two years ago. Alabama was outclassed one week after an impressive road win over Oklahoma, managing just 151 yards before the meaningless final minutes of this blowout.\n\nTy Simpson passed for 67 yards before backup Austin Mack replaced him in the third quarter. Mack immediately got the Tide rolling on a 65-yard drive leading to a short field goal, but the Hoosiers responded with two unstoppable TD drives.\n\nIndiana dominated the famous Rose Bowl turf, which stayed pristine despite nearly 24 hours of steady rain before kickoff. The storms dissipated while the Hoosiers took their first-half lead, and blue skies appeared in the second half.\n\nAfter the first scoreless first quarter in a Rose Bowl in 26 years, Indiana’s second drive stretched 84 yards and 16 plays over nearly nine minutes before Nicolas Radicic’s 31-yard field goal on the first snap of the second quarter.\n\nIndiana’s defense then stopped Alabama on fourth and 1 at the Tide 34, and Mendoza fired a long, high pass to the leaping Becker four plays later for a 21-yard touchdown.\n\nSimpson fumbled in Indiana territory after a courageous first-down scramble late in the first half, and the Hoosiers methodically drove for Mendoza’s 1-yard TD pass with 17 seconds left to Cooper, the hero of Indiana’s dramatic victory over Penn State.\n\nAfter halftime, Mendoza led a steady 79-yard drive ending in his 24-yard TD pass to the leaping Sarratt.\n\nThe victory is the latest step in the monumental two-season turnaround of what was the losingest program in college football when Cignetti took charge. After winning 11 games and reaching the CFP last season, the Hoosiers steamrolled through their schedule this fall before beating defending national champion Ohio State for the Big Ten title and ascending to the No. 1 spot in the AP Top 25 for the first time.\n\nAlabama: It was remarkable to see the most successful program of the 21st century get dominated up front. The Tide’s inability to run the ball was a season-long problem, but it was particularly painful in Pasadena. Whether through personnel or scheme, DeBoer’s offense must take a step forward next year to reach the standard expected at Bama.\n\nIndiana: The Hoosiers acted like they’ve been here before, even though they haven’t. Cignetti’s group has a businesslike demeanor that wasn’t remotely altered by Alabama’s reputation and history.\n\nAlabama: Host East Carolina on Sept. 5.\n\nIndiana: A trip to Atlanta to face the powerhouse Ducks, who lost last season’s Rose Bowl to Ohio State as the No. 1 seed.",

    "fullText": "A general practitioner in the UK has been suspended for five months after booking in two fictitious appointments at the end of her workday to avoid being late to pick up her children.\n\nDr Helen Eisenhauer, 43, was working at the Stenhouse Medical Centre in Arnold, England, when she scheduled the bogus appointments on an afternoon in 2024.\n\nAt a recent tribunal hearing, the mom said she was “thoroughly ashamed” of her behavior and admitted she struggled to balance her personal and professional duties, per The Times of London.\n\n“The incident occurred at a time of particular stress for me when I was having to balance the demands of my young family with busy professional commitments,” Eisenhauer declared. “I fully accept, however, that this does not excuse my dishonesty.”\n\nThe harsh penalty has sparked heated debate in the UK, where there is a significant shortage of doctors.\n\nMore than one-fifth of Brits who booked an appointment to see a general practitioner in November had to wait at least two weeks, per The Times. 7.5% of patients waited a month or more.\n\nIt’s estimated Eisenhauer earns around £60,000 (USD $80,000) per year, although she works part-time, The Times reports.\n\nEisenhauer said she was suffering from sleep deprivation at the time she added the two fake appointments to her diary.\n\nThe busy mom admitted she failed to make proper childcare arrangements for the day and needed to pick up her children by 6 p.m. She feared seeing two more patients would mean she wouldn’t leave the practice until after that time.\n\nA partner at the medical practice, where Eisenhauer has worked since 2018, noticed anomalies in her schedule and confronted her at a meeting.\n\nEisenhauer subsequently reported herself to the UK’s General Medical Council.\n\n“I am thoroughly ashamed and determined never to compromise the medical profession or myself again,” the doctor stated at the recent tribunal hearing.\n\nDespite her contrition, she was slapped with the five-month ban.\n\n“Dr Eisenhauer displayed a reckless disregard for patient safety and professional standards,” tribunal chairman Neil Dalton declared.\n\nHowever, many moms are rallying around Eisenhauer and saying her situation proves reforms are needed for working parents.\n\n“It’s sad that our system pushes vital workers to these extremes,” one supporter stated on\n\n“Anyone who has raced from work with their heart racing to avoid being late for nursery or after school pick up will have enormous sympathy for this lady,” another parent posited.\n\n“I think the real problem here is not that she did it, but she had to do it,” a third declared.",

    "title": "Lincoln Riley vowed to fix the Trojans' defense, but it faltered again in Alamo Bowl",
    "description": "The coach said \"we have the personnel\" to be great, and reaching that level will fall on a new defensive coordinator, USC's third in five seasons.",
    "fullText": "Two years ago, a day after he decided to fire Alex Grinch as USC's defensive coordinator, Lincoln Riley made a promise to those concerned about the future of the Trojans' defense.\n\n“I have complete belief, conviction. We will play great defense here,” the coach said in November 2023. “It is going to happen. There's not a reason in the world why it can’t.”\n\nTwo years later, another defensive coordinator is out the door at USC. The day after Grinch’s replacement, D’Anton Lynn, left to take the same job at Penn State, Riley stood in front of reporters, assuring everyone once again that soon enough, USC would be great on that side of the ball.\n\n“The arrow,” he said Tuesday, “is pointing straight up.”\n\n“The opportunity for us to make a hire, to continue to make us better and to go from being a very good defense to being a great defense is the goal.”\n\nYet patience on that promise is wearing thin, especially given how the season had ended less than an hour before. USC blew a 10-point lead in the final five minutes against Texas Christian on Tuesday, a team playing without its star quarterback, before missing four tackles on a third-and-20 walk-off touchdown in overtime. The disastrous Alamo Bowl defeat would serve as an especially sobering reminder that while USC made progress under Lynn, it’s still a ways from heeding Riley’s guarantee.\n\nAnd now, the defense will have to start again, with a new direction, a new scheme and a new coordinator, who will be Riley’s third hire in five seasons at USC.\n\nIn spite of all that, Riley was upbeat when asked about the unit’s future Tuesday night. He felt “fantastic,” he said, about where USC’s defense was headed.\n\n“We have the personnel,” Riley said of becoming a great defensive unit. “We're on an upward trend. And, you know, there's going to be a lot of interest in this job. I mean, this will be an extremely, extremely coveted job, and I can already tell by the nature of what my phone's been like the last couple of days.”\n\nSeveral potential candidates with deep experience, as well as close ties to USC athletics officials, are expected to be available.\n\nFormer Texas defensive coordinator Pete Kwiatkowski, who worked at Washington under current USC athletic director Jennifer Cohen, was let go by the Longhorns earlier this month. Cincinnati Bengals defensive coordinator Al Golden, meanwhile, worked closely with USC general manager Chad Bowden at Notre Dame and could be looking for a job as soon as next week.\n\nBoth coached college defenses that ranked in the top four in the nation in points allowed during the 2024 season.\n\nUSC appeared bound for a similar trajectory after Year 1 with Lynn. The Trojans allowed 10 fewer points per game, leaping from 121st in scoring defense under Grinch to 56th in his first season at USC. They got stingier on third down — 106th nationally to 21st — and in the red zone — 119th to 69th. Lynn was even named candidate for the Broyles Award, given to the nation’s top assistant.\n\nIn some respects, USC’s defense continued to take steps forward in Year 2 under Lynn. It gave up fewer points and fewer yards per game. The pass rush improved, adding 10 sacks to its season total in 2025.\n\nBut the personnel on defense was less proven this season — and more prone to mistakes. The secondary struggled through stretches. A thin group of linebackers was often overwhelmed. The defensive interior was manhandled for most of the season, and in each of their three regular-season losses, the Trojans were trampled on the ground.\n\nLast month, when asked about the group’s inconsistency, Lynn said that USC’s youth forced him to “scale back” significantly on defense. He actually wondered, in the wake of USC’s loss to Oregon, if he shouldn’t have scaled back the defense even more this season.\n\n“It’s different when you’re teaching an 18-year-old versus teaching a guy who has been at two to three schools who has already played a bunch of college ball,” Lynn said.\n\nLynn, nonetheless, leaves USC in a better place than when he arrived. The nation’s No. 1 recruiting class lands on campus next week, with plenty of highly ranked reinforcements on the way. Talented freshmen like defensive linemen Jahkeem Stewart and Floyd Boucard as well as defensive back Alex Graham are rising stars who should be ready to step into significant roles.\n\nBut USC will have to replace three starters in the secondary, including Kamari Ramsey, its best linebacker [Eric Gentry] and its top run stopper on the defensive line [Anthony Lucas]. Whomever takes over as coordinator will be expected to take a significant step forward immediately, up against one of the nation’s toughest schedules in what should be a decisive season for the program.\n\nThen there’s the matter of Riley’s job security, which could make any available top coordinator queasy.\n\nYet as far as the coach is concerned, the path to finding a great coordinator and fielding a great defense isn’t that far off from what USC has now.\n\n“I definitely don't want to press reset,” Riley said. “I'm excited about the process, and I think it's going to make us better, I know it will. So, we'll wake up tomorrow morning and we'll get on it.”\n\n In your inbox every Monday morning.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "A New York Times deep dive alleges that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth donned makeup for a February meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart.",
    "fullText": "United States Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addresses a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2025 \n\nA New York Times deep dive alleges that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth donned makeup for a February meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart during which he seemed much more concerned with his appearance than policy.\n\nThe Times published a comprehensive story about the Trump administration’s handling of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on Tuesday in which it suggested that Hegseth began his tenure at the Pentagon “as something of a blank slate on the war.”\n\n“He didn’t have any of his own thoughts on Russia and Ukraine,” an ex-Pentagon official told the Gray Lady. “But he had civilian advisers who did.”\n\nOn Day 4, the freshly minted defense secretary sat at a Pentagon conference table as one of his coterie of advisers argued for an immediate U-turn.\n\nThe ideological godfather of the group was Elbridge A. Colby, grandson of the Nixon-era C.I.A. director William E. Colby. The younger Mr. Colby and Mr. Vance had been introduced in 2015 by an editor at National Review who thought they were like-minded. Nearly nine years later, as Mr. Biden poured billions of dollars into arming Ukraine, Mr. Colby argued that “we would have been better served to put a lot more of that money to use in the Pacific.”\n\nNow, it was one of his disciples, Dan Caldwell, presenting the group’s recommendations to Mr. Hegseth, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other military leaders.\n\nThe Pentagon, Mr. Caldwell argued, should pause delivery of certain munitions that the Biden administration had promised to Ukraine, because, he believed, existing stocks were insufficient to execute America’s war plans around the world. Nor should it use the additional $3.8 billion left unspent by the Biden administration to buy weapons for Ukraine.\n\nGeneral Brown did not speak as Mr. Caldwell wrapped up. He simply shifted uncomfortably in his chair.\n\nDuring a trip to Europe the next month, Hegseth reportedly made sure to powder his nose for the cameras, but declined to answer Ukrainian defense minister Rustem Umerov’s queries:\n\nThe Ukrainians had repeatedly requested a proper sit-down. Instead it would be a brief stand-up affair in an anteroom.\n\nBeforehand, according to an American official present, Mr. Hegseth dabbed his nose with powder from a small compact. “Look commanding,” he told one aide. The handshake with the Ukrainian might be shown on Fox; the president might be watching.\n\nThen the standing meeting began, Mr. Umerov coming in close, taking his voice down to a whisper, assuring the secretary that he knew America’s political and security agenda might be changing. He didn’t ask for new aid. He just needed to know one thing: Would the U.S. military continue to supply the munitions Ukraine was counting on, the ones approved by Mr. Biden? Every delivery sustained the lives of Ukrainian soldiers on the front lines; every delivery that didn’t arrive one day meant those soldiers would die the next.\n\nAgain and again, Mr. Umerov repeated his plea: “I just need you to be honest with me. Just be honest with me.”\n\nHegseth allegedly offered Umerov only nodding.\n\n“He wasn’t pleading for the answer that he wanted, but just for honesty, some indication,” observed one U.S. official. “He was saying: You can trust me; you can trust us. Just tell me what you guys are thinking.”\n\nThe post New York Times Deep Dive Alleges Pete Hegseth Donned Makeup for Ukraine Photo Op — Then Ignored Counterpart first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "How Rueben Bain Jr., Miami defense wrecked Ohio State's bid for national title repeat at Cotton Bowl originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nHow would you grade what Miami defensive end Rueben Bain and the Hurricanes' defense brought to the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic?\n\nTry \"Category 5.\" That is how Miami legend Michael Irvin described the Hurricanes from the sideline during the first half.\n\n\"Category 5 you can't even hunker down in,\" Irvin screamed from the sidelines in the first half. \"All s— get torn up.'\n\n\"Hurricane Rueben\" tore it up, all right. Defensive end Rueben Bain Jr. was the center of the Miami storm that overtook AT&T Stadium. He made that kind of impact in the first half and when it mattered most in the fourth quarter for the Hurricanes.\n\nNo. 10 Miami beat No. 2 Ohio State 24-14 on Wednesday in the biggest College Football Playoff upset ever – a payback receipt from the 2003 BCS championship game the program had been dying to redeem.\n\nRemember, No. 2 Ohio State upset No. 1 Miami in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 3, 2003 – a game that featured 52 future NFL Draft picks. The Buckeyes took the mantle as a perennial national championship contender that night, too.\n\nIt was a role reversal this time.The Buckeyes (12-2) were the defending national champion. Ohio State allowed 8.2 points per game and had at least one consensus All-American at every level of their defense, including Kayden McDonald, Arvell Reese and Caleb Downs.\n\nMORE: Who does Miami face next?\n\nThey just didn't have Bain. The Hurricanes (12-2) out-flanked the Ohio State offense and Heisman Trophy finalist Julian Sayin – who took five sacks in the loss. Bain – a consensus All-American – led that defense to the CFP semifinals at the Vrbo Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 8 – one step closer to a championship appearance at their home field in Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla.\n\nMiami will face either No. 3 Georgia (12-1) or No. 6 Ole Miss (12-1) in the CFP semifinals, and that promises to be another \"rock fight\" which coach Mario Cristobal has embraced. He was asked about that physical play on the ESPN telecast afterward.\n\n\"Our guys have really worked on being a physical, violent bunch and you know what?\" Cristobal said before stopping himself. \"Coach Johnson!\"\n\nThat's Jimmy Johnson, of course, the coach who led Miami to a national championship in 1987. Irivin, Johnson, Ray Lewis and all the legends from that heyday witnessed the next Hurricanes' icon at work.\n\nBain made his presence felt in the first quarter when he set the edge by pushing Ohio State guard Austin Siereveld into running back Bo Jackson for a tackle for loss.\n\nRUEBEN BAIN JR. MADE THE TACKLE WHILE BEING BLOCKED 😳 pic.twitter.com/wlP4Tojdvm\n\n— ACC Network (@accnetwork) January 1, 2026\n\nBain had a sack in the second quarter, and edge rusher Akheem Mesidor added two sacks. That dynamic pass-rushing tandem kept the Buckeyes out of sorts for the first half. Bain shielded Sayin by jumping into the air on a screen pass, which defensive back Keionte Scott jumped and took 72 yards for a TD and a 14-0 lead with 11:49 left in the second quarter.\n\nThe Hurricanes limited the Buckeyes to 154 yards – including minus-three rushing yards – in the first half. Miami quarterback Carson Beck meanwhile, hit 14 of 18 passes for 98 yards and a touchdown.\n\nOhio State struck back in the second half. Sayin heated up, the Buckeyes had two TD drives of 11 and 10 plays, respectively, and cut the lead to 17-14 on a 14-yard TD pass to Jeremiah Smith with 13:28 remaining in the fourth quarter. Bain had been mostly quiet to that point, other than drawing a double team that set up a sack by Wesley Bissainthe.\n\nWhen the Buckeyes got the ball back, Bain stepped up again. After a third-and-15 conversion to Smith, Bain drew a holding penalty. Then he chased Sayin into a check-down that forced a punt. That was the defining sequence of the fourth quarter. Bain was relentless.\n\nThey say if you can’t get pressure rushing 4 then you aren’t a great defensive line, well Rueben Bain Jr. just got to the QB while rushing 3.\n\nTop-10 pick, explosiveness is other worldly and his speed is devious pic.twitter.com/6lm5Y0GRPW\n\n— BKS Sports (@BKSecretsports) January 1, 2026\n\nMiami drove 70 yards for the game-sealing TD – a 5-yard TD run by CharMar Brown. The Hurricanes had their biggest win since the 37-14 victory against No. 2 Nebraska at the 2002 BCS championship at the Rose Bowl.\n\nThis isn't that team. Those Hurricanes' teams had a lineage of seen-on-Sunday legends. This one is built around Beck – who finished 19 of 26 for 138 yards and running back Mark Fletcher Jr., who had 19 rushing attempts for 90 yards. Bain and Mesidor led the defense, and it was impressive.\n\nSayin finished 22 of 35 for 287 yards, a TD and two interceptions. Smith – a Miami, native – had seven catches for 157 yards and a TD. Yet the Buckeyes had just 24 rushing attempts for 45 yards. They also didn't have the best player in this playoff.\n\nThat is Bain. He has four of Miami's 12 sacks in two playoff games. He has to be in consideration to be the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, and with this defense the Hurricanes have a legitimate chance for a national championship for the first time since that fateful night in Tempe, Ariz. Now, the Hurricanes are back, and a SEC semifinalist is next.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSaturday night marks Part 4 of the Kyle Shanahan–Mike Macdonald series.\n\nThe latest chapter arrives in the final week of the NFL regular season, with the San Francisco 49ers hosting the Seattle Seahawks on Saturday night on ABC/ESPN.\n\nThe stakes could not be higher. The winner clinches the NFC’s No. 1 seed and the division title, while the loser is relegated to the wild-card field.\n\nOnce again, one of the league’s premier offenses will be tested by one of its top defenses. Through the first three meetings, Shanahan’s offense holds a 2–1 edge over Macdonald’s defense.\n\nSeattle enters the matchup boasting a top five defense, leading the NFL on third down, ranking second in points allowed, and sitting inside the top three against the run. However, the 49ers’ offense has been operating at an elite level in recent weeks.\n\nSan Francisco also ranks No. 1 in the league on third down, setting the stage for a fascinating contrast of strengths. The chess match between play caller and defensive architect is once again front and center.\n\nMacdonald addressed what he’s seeing from the 49ers’ offense during his media availability on Wednesday.\n\n“The great offensive play callers and designers in our league evolve consistently,” he said. “And (Shanahan’s) done it with the best of them.”\n\n“When you turn on the tape, maybe it’s one thing—no, it’s everything. They’re protecting Brock well. He’s making decisive decisions. He’s been accurate. And he’s got the element of being able to extend plays as well, creating maybe when the first couple reads aren’t there.”",

    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nThe first Iron Beam laser defense system was deployed by Israel on Sunday. This 100kW laser weapon thus became the world’s first high-power drone defense zapper to be operationally deployed. Iron Beam lasers will fortify Israel’s multi-layered defense, complementing the existing Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Arrow system architecture.\n\nThe Iron Beam is a short-range line-of-sight laser interceptor that is extremely cheap to run and, therefore, perfectly suited for intercepting low-cost, high-volume threats. According to the official Israeli announcement, Iron Beam systems have “successfully intercepted rockets, mortars, and UAVs.”\n\nA complex mix of government, military, scientific, and commercial interests were responsible for the research and development of the Iron Beam laser system. Central to the Iron Beam are “an advanced laser source and a unique electro-optical targeting system, enabling the interception of a wide range of targets at an enhanced operational range, with maximum precision and superior efficiency,” boasted the press release by Israel’s MoD. Moreover, it works “at a negligible marginal cost, which constitutes the laser system’s primary advantage.”\n\nWe don’t get much more by way of technical details, perhaps understandably. However, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems execs heralded the system’s “unique adaptive optics technology,” in what it calls “the world’s most advanced laser-based system for intercepting aerial threats.” Its operational debut “marks the beginning of the era of high-energy laser defense,” they claimed.\n\nWe have seen low-energy laser defense systems deployed earlier this year, with Japan’s NTT using relatively puny lasers to scare birds away from poultry farms and prevent the spread of avian flu. But the Iron Beam is in a different league.\n\nWe also previously reported on several other UK laser weapons under development to counter UAVs on land and at sea. But as far as we know, these are yet to become operational. With the brutal war between Ukraine and Russia ongoing, where drones have grown to be a pivotal feature of the conflict, forces have gone as far as creating rotating barbed wire barriers to deter them. So, laser-drone defenses similar to the Iron Beam are going to be in strong demand.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.",

    "fullText": "TOKYO (AP) — Japan is barreling forward with efforts to significantly boost its military capabilities to stand up to China’s growing threats by doubling annual arms spending. The goal comes as Tokyo’s main ally, the United States, pushes for more military assistance in Asia and a military hawk and ultra-conservative takes over Japan's leadership.\n\nJapan says it is still a peaceful nation and the buildup is necessary for a more self-reliant military that can better deter China. But Beijing and other critics see Japan as deviating from its postwar peace pledge, pointing to Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's statement soon after taking office that any Chinese military action against Taiwan could be grounds for a Japanese military response.\n\nJapan’s transformation into one of the world’s major defense spenders has developed over decades and raises the question of whether the ongoing buildup is a violation of its pacifist constitution.\n\nJapan’s constitution has been hollowed out\n\nAfter World War II, Japan was not supposed to have a military.\n\nDuring the 1945-1952 U.S. occupation, American officials wanted to stamp out the militarism that led to Japanese aggression across Asia before and during the war.\n\nUnder Article 9 of the U.S.-drafted 1947 constitution, Japan renounced the use of force to settle international disputes, and the right to maintain land, sea and air forces for that purpose.\n\nThe U.S. changed its mind about Japanese militarism when the Korean War started in 1950. Japan became an ally, not a threat, leading to the creation of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces in 1954. Article 9 is now widely seen as the legal basis for Japan to have a sufficient military to defend itself.\n\nJapan has since repeatedly stretched the definition of self-defense, allowing overseas dispatches of its troops as part of international peacekeeping operations, though mostly avoiding combat missions.\n\nA big change came in 2014, under former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who wanted Japan to have a normal military. Abe newly interpreted Article 9 as legalizing collective defense. The following year, a security law allowed Japan to use force if the United States or other friendly nations come under enemy attack, even if Japan is not being attacked.\n\nThis was Abe’s attempt to have a normal military without formally changing the constitution.\n\nTakaichi angered China by giving a hypothetical example of such a situation, a deviation from former leaders’ strategic ambiguity.\n\nThe flap with Beijing escalated in December when Chinese aircraft locked their radars, considered possible preparation for firing missiles, on Japanese planes during Chinese aircraft carrier drills near southwestern Japan.\n\nTwo Chinese aircraft carriers also were spotted in June operating near the southern Japanese island of Iwo Jima for the first time. This led to worry in Tokyo about Beijing’s rapidly expanding military activity far beyond its borders and in areas around islands claimed by both countries.\n\nTakaichi’s Cabinet last week approved a record defense budget plan. It exceeds 9 trillion yen ($58 billion) for the coming year and aims to fortify its strike-back capability and coastal defense with cruise missiles and unmanned arsenals.\n\nIn Beijing later that day, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian criticized the Takaichi government for accelerating the pace of its military buildup and expansion, and added: “Japan is deviating from the path of peaceful development it has long claimed to uphold and is moving further and further in a dangerous direction.”\n\nChina, which spends a huge amount on its own defense, may also see Takaichi as a defender of Japanese wartime aggression. Before taking office, she was a regular at Tokyo’s Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japan’s 2.5 million war dead, including convicted war criminals. Victims of Japanese aggression, especially China and the Koreas, see visits to the shrine as tantamount to a lack of remorse about Japan’s wartime past.\n\nTakaichi stayed away from Yasukuni in 2025 and sent a religious ornament marking the Aug. 15 anniversary of Japan’s defeat as a personal gesture instead of praying at the shrine.\n\nJapan takes on more offensive roles\n\nA fundamental change came in December 2022 when former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s government adopted a security strategy stating the need for Japan to acquire strike-back capability with long-range missiles, a major break from Japan’s self-defense-only policy.\n\nThe strategy names China as Japan’s biggest strategic challenge and calls for a more offensive role for Japanese troops under its security alliance with the U.S as the allies work more closely together.\n\nMasahiro Sakata, former head of the Cabinet Legislative Bureau, described the move as “the death of Article 9.”\n\nAfter the war, Japan long prioritized economic development over defense while relying largely on the U.S. by hosting about 50,000 American troops who also serve the region.\n\nJapan maintained a defense spending cap of 1% of GDP until the annual defense budget started to rise under Abe’s nearly decade-long leadership, to about 1.1%. Takaichi is certain to achieve a 2% target by March, two years earlier than planned, and is expected to push for more spending in coming years as Japan is under growing pressure after NATO adopted a new target of 5%.\n\nJapan plans to promote defense industry\n\nTakaichi’s revised security and defense policy would aim to further bolster Japan with unmanned combative weapons and long-range missiles. It is expected to scrap remaining restrictions on arms exports to promote the development of Japan’s defense industry and cooperation with friendly nations.\n\nJapan has long banned arms exports but has significantly eased restrictions in recent years and is now developing next-generation fighter jets with the UK and Italy while finalizing a deal to sell frigates to Australia. Japan also will to provide support for construction and maintenance for U.S. warships.\n\nA government-commissioned panel has proposed Japan consider developing a nuclear submarine to achieve a more long-distance deterrence capability, a controversial idea for a country that has long maintained non-nuclear principles.\n\nJapan has requested Washington ensure protection through the extended deterrence of nuclear weapons. A number of officials recently expressed support for Japan’s nuclear possession, which has led to criticism from Japanese atomic bomb survivors and other pacifist groups.\n\nJapan stands by its three non-nuclear principles of not possessing, not producing and not allowing its presence, according to Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, although he said Japan is considering all options for a possible new submarine.",

    "fullText": "Playing without Alperen Şengün should change the math for the Houston Rockets. On Saturday night, it only changed the look- and not in a way Cleveland was ready for.\n\nWith Şengün sidelined by a calf issue, Houston didn’t try to replace his production possession by possession. They redistributed responsibility. The offense flattened out, the pace stayed controlled, and the hierarchy became simple: defend first, move the ball early, and let Kevin Durant dictate when scoring was needed.\n\nWithout Houston’s usual post hub on the floor, Durant became both the pressure point and the release valve. He scored early, drew attention without forcing shots, and punished Cleveland for never fully committing to a double. He didn’t play hero ball, but he did ensure structure was maintained and embraced his role within it.\n\nSteven Adams anchored the paint, controlled the glass, and kept Cleveland from getting second chances. Tari Eason brought disruption and energy in the gaps. Reed Sheppard spaced the floor and punished late rotations. Everyone stayed in their lane.\n\nDefensively, the Rockets looked even more locked in. Without Şengün’s playmaking responsibilities to manage, Houston simplified reads, stayed connected, and turned stops into rhythm without rushing. And Cleveland never found a clean way to speed the game up.\n\nSaturday night proved that not only can Houston survive without Şengün- they can toggle styles when needed by leaning on defense, rebounding, and discipline, instead of flow. That kind of adaptability is the difference between a good team and a serious one.",

    "description": "The heat continues to get turned up on Matt Eberflus as the Cowboys are now just one game away from their offseason protocol.",
    "fullText": "Dallas Cowboys' owner Jerry Jones loves to tell everyone he'd do whatever it takes to buy a championship. We all know that's not exactly true, however. Jones doesn't like firing head coaches before their contracts run out, as witnessed by them retaining Mike McCarthy for 2024 despite there being top candidates on the market like Sean Payton and Mike MacDonald, both currently in line for No. 1 seeds in their second seasons with their orgs.\n\nAfter McCarthy didn't work out, he went for the cheap option of Brian Schottenheimer instead of getting into bidding wars for the top candidates in 2025. Now Schottenheimer is fighting to achieve .500 while Ben Johnson, Liam Coen and Mike Vrabel round out the top-5 Coach of the Year candidates with Payton and MacDonald. In other words, the Cowboys could do more to get them a championship.\n\nJones' claims are about to be put to the test, yet again. Dallas is expected to move on from defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus. The org felt like Eberflus got away years ago, as the promising LB coach went to Indy to be DC before being head coach in Chicago. His reunion hasn't worked out as the Cowboys have fielded one of the worst defenses in recent history.\n\nThe scheme hasn't fit the players, and Eberflus hasn't been flexible enough to adjust. It's hard to envision a fourth new coordinator in four seasons, but that's better than giving him another season to ruin in opposition to a top offense.\n\nFortunately, there are a few options for defensive coordinators in 2026. There is however, one who is currently standing tall above the rest: Minnesota Vikings DC Brian Flores.\n\nFlores' resume is ridiculously impressive. Just this season, they rank 10th in fewest points allowed and fifth in fewest yards allowed (going into Week 17). The fact that he's done this playing opposite a wholly inept offense for the year says a lot. Bad offense means the opposition gets more possessions and scoring opportunities, plus favorable field position.\n\nDespite this, they've held six different opponents under 20 points in a game. They've done this to three of their last four opponents, with only the Cowboys crossing the threshold. They were so good against Detroit on Thursday, they won despite the Vikings' offense passing for just three yards.\n\nThe Vikings forced six turnovers in the win. For comparison's sake, Dallas has only kept an opponent under 20 points once this season. Watching Flores' defense game in and game out over the last month has proven to many onlookers what Minnesota fans have known; he's a mastermind.\n\nBut Flores is far more than what he's accomplished this season. Flores is a master of his craft. He improved the Vikings' DVOA from 24th in 2022 to 11th in his first year, and they soared to No. 2 in 2024. He earned his stripes under Bill Belichick in New England, serving as an assistant from 2008 through 2018, getting a head coaching opportunity in Miami in 2019. He went 5-11, then 10-6 and then bounced back from a 1-7 start to finish 9-8 in 2021.\n\nBut it was there that Flores ran afoul of the league's top brass. Dolphins' owner Stephen Ross tried to hire Payton illegally (docked a first and third-round pick) and then Flores ended up suing the Dolphins and the league. He provided claims that the Dolphins owner wanted him to tank games, offering cash payments, which he refused to do.\n\nFlores' success in Miami and his success as a DC since have not landed him on many of the league's insiders lists of potential hiring candidates this round. If he doesn't land a top gig, he's actually out of contract with the Vikings. They talked last offseason of extending him, but that never came to fruition.\n\nSo now, unless something is worked out over the next 10 days, Flores will enter this offseason as a coaching free agent. With the possibility he could be interviewed for a head coach opening, it would seem foolish to re-up with the Vikings for their coordinator gig, but technically not impossible.\n\nIf he doesn't, which should be the case, that opens the door for the Cowboys to offer him the moon to come in and save their defense. Joining high-profile Dallas, being the savior their defensive woes, would absolutely be the feather in Flores' cap.\n\nHere's a look at the rest of our top five DC candidates.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cowboys Wire: Wk 17 Eberflus Replacement Rankings: Flores top Cowboys DC candidate",

Statistically, they have the worst red-zone D in the league this season.”\n\nThe Patriots are giving up a staggering 74% of touchdowns when opponents reach the red zone, making it the worst rate in the NFL.\n\nNew England will likely face a handful of powerful offenses in the postseason, and it won’t be able to compete if it doesn’t limit opposing teams to field goals.\n\nThe Patriots need to focus on improving their red zone defense over the next two weeks, especially as they face the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins, both of whom will be starting backup quarterbacks.\n\nWhy NFL Writer Would’ve Loved To See Myles Garrett On Patriots This Season",

    "fullText": "Vladimir Putin’s “keeper of secrets” died on Christmas Day, less than two years after the Russian president fired him.\n\nColonel-General Yuri Sadovenko, 56, died from “heart disease” on Christmas Day in Moscow, according to Russian news outlets. The Sun reports that the Ukrainian-born Sadovenko was close to former Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu.\n\nSadovenko served as the deputy defense minister up until he and Shoigu were ousted in May 2024 as part of a massive shakeup at the Kremlin. Shoigu, to whom Sadavenko had reportedly acted as a “gatekeeper,” is now the secretary of Russia’s security council.\n\nSadavenko, who had been sanctioned by Britain and other western states, reportedly showed no signs of ill health before his death.\n\nHe had previously been embroiled in scandal after his wife, Maria Kitaeva, left him for another deputy defense minister, Timur Ivanov, according to The Sun.\n\nIvanov, 50, was arrested in April 2024 and convicted in July 2025 on charges of embezzlement and money laundering, receiving a 13-year prison sentence, the Associated Press reported.\n\nSince the Russia-Ukraine war began in February 2022, numerous top government officials have died under suspicious or sudden circumstances.\n\nOn Monday, a funeral was held in Moscow for Stanislav Orlov, 44, the head of a notorious volunteer brigade of neo-Nazi football hooligans who have fought in Ukraine.\n\nIndependent Russian news outlets have reported that Orlov, nicknamed the “Spaniard,” was ambushed and shot by Moscow’s own security forces earlier this month, according to The Guardian.\n\nOrlov’s death adds to a growing list of Russian military and civilian leaders who have died, most notably Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenaries.\n\nPrigozhin, 62, was killed in a plane crash in August 2023, weeks after he led an insurrection against Putin. He had once been close enough to the Russian dictator to earn the nickname “Putin’s chef.”\n\nIn July this year, Putin sacked Transport Minister Roman Starovoit, 53, who was found dead hours later in a park with a gunshot wound to the head. His death was ruled a suicide.\n\nOn the same day, Andrei Korneichuk, 42, another transportation official who had worked closely with Starovoit, collapsed and died of what was said to be a heart attack.\n\nOther deaths have long sparked jokes about staying away from windows and seen a series of former high-ranking officials being suddenly found dead stories below where they were last seen.\n\nHowever not all sudden deaths are equal. Ukraine has been able to assassinate several leading Russian military figures many hundreds of miles behind enemy lines in recent months.\n\nLast week, a top general, Lt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov, died after a bomb exploded under his car. The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation believes Ukraine could be behind the blast.",

    "title": "NATO is looking to Ukraine for ways to kill drones without wasting expensive missiles",
    "description": "Western militaries are looking at interceptor drones — proven in combat in Ukraine — as an ideal low-cost air defense.",
    "fullText": "NATO militaries are looking for cheaper ways to defeat hostile drones without having to expend vastly more expensive missiles. The answer, it seems, is in Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian forces are using domestically produced interceptor drones daily to bring down deadly Russian drones, with units regularly sharing footage of the high-speed aerial chases.\n\nThe interceptor drones can be mass-produced, which is crucial for Ukraine as worsening Russian bombardments that sometimes include hundreds of drones and missiles in a single night put stress on the country's deeply strained air defense network.\n\nNATO is taking note, with officials identifying interceptor drones not just as a cheap way to fill a capability gap — air defense against relatively inexpensive attack drones — but also as an early indication of where warfare is going. Some allied countries are developing systems, while others are rushing to buy them at scale.\n\n\"Technology is evolving really, really rapidly,\" British Army Brig. Gen. Chris Gent, the deputy chief of staff for transformation and integration at NATO Allied Land Command, said at a recent training event in Poland. \"It's a race to keep up.\"\n\nInterceptor drones emerged this year as a priority defense investment for Ukraine as it looks for ways to stay ahead of Russia's growing drone production and worsening nightly attacks without totally depleting its surface-to-air missile stocks or breaking the bank to take out cheap yet inexpensive threats.\n\nUkraine's defense industry produces hundreds of interceptor drones each day, some of which cost as little as $2,500. That's a fraction of the cost of a standard Russian one-way attack drone, estimated to be worth $35,000 on the low end. They can carry small warheads and are designed to directly strike their targets midair or explode nearby for a proximity kill.\n\nThe interceptor drones have provided Kyiv with a significant increase in air defense options. They can reach higher and faster-moving targets than the truck-mounted machine guns that Ukrainian soldiers had long relied on to shoot down low-flying Russian airborne targets, and they allow the country to hold its critical surface-to-air missiles in reserve for higher-end threats.\n\nSeeing how effective interceptor drones have been, NATO is now racing to develop and field its own. That push took on new urgency in September after Russian drones strayed into Polish and Romanian airspace, prompting Western forces to scramble fighter jets.\n\nThe incursions — and NATO's scramble to respond — raised questions about how the alliance should handle cheap drones, and whether it's sustainable to launch fighter jets armed with expensive missiles for every airspace violation.\n\nWhile NATO is still flying fighter patrols, Poland and Romania have purchased and are deploying the American-made Merops system, which consists of an interceptor drone that has already taken down more than 1,900 Russian targets for Ukraine.\n\nIn late November, Business Insider observed Polish, Romanian, and American forces training on the Merops system. Military officials touted the system's success in combat and its ability to provide NATO with a cheap air defense for its Eastern flank. (The interceptor drone costs $15,000, still less than the potential threats.)\n\nAt that training event, US Army Brig. Gen. Curtis King, the head of the 10th Army Air and Missile Defense Command, said that NATO needs to \"learn from what Ukraine is fighting right now.\"\n\nHe said that in addition to Poland, Romania, and the US, other NATO allies are experimenting with similar systems, the aim being to employ this technology across the alliance.\n\nAnd Western countries are linking up with the Ukrainians on this technology as well. In September, for instance, the UK announced plans to mass-produce thousands of Ukrainian-designed interceptor drones for Kyiv. The US is also making these weapons in collaboration with Ukraine.\n\nThe general said that getting Western firms to produce more interceptor drones will help drive the cost down even further for NATO countries interested in acquiring this technology.\n\nThe value is clear, King said. Procuring interceptor drones would allow NATO countries to save sophisticated air defenses, such as the MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missile system or certain air-to-air missiles, for threats like cruise and ballistic missiles, rather than one-way attack drones.\n\nInterceptor drones are among the newer innovations emerging from the war as Ukraine and Russia attempt to secure a technological advantage, with each new capability fielded pushing the other side to develop a countermeasure.\n\nAt the Merops training in Poland, Western officials said they are watching Ukraine and Russia race through cycles of weapons innovation at a pace that demands faster procurement before new tools become obsolete.\n\n\"The life cycle of technology has shortened dramatically,\" said Bart Hollants, NATO's innovation broker.\n\n\"It's not a new trend, but we see it on the battlefield in Ukraine,\" he told Business Insider, explaining that \"every six weeks to three months, there is a new iteration or a new version of tech that enters the front line, and that you have to defend yourself against, or that you have to create countermeasures for.\"\n\nWith that pacing in mind, NATO has turned to Western and Ukrainian defense firms for new ways to counter the war's biggest threats, giving these companies chances to pitch, test, and market systems as combat-ready.\n\nEarlier this year, NATO hosted an \"Innovation Challenge\" that brought in companies to present solutions for Russian glide bombs and one-way attack drones. Two firms — one French and the other German — won first and second place, respectively, for their solutions, made up of interceptor drones.\n\nFrench Cdr. Pierre Delom, a project coordinator at NATO's Allied Command Transformation who leads the Innovation Challenges, said that the alliance could find itself at war at any moment and needed to be ready.\n\nThe key, he told Business Insider, is the mass production of affordable air defenses so that NATO doesn't have to spend any more money to counter low-cost threats than necessary. In a future fight, these threats may be out in force, and the alliance can't afford to pour expensive missiles into that fight. Sustainability is about making every dollar count.",

    "fullText": "Give credit to the Kansas City Chiefs defense, and to tight end Travis Kelce—they both came to play, and as a result the Chiefs were nearly able to pull off an improbable upset against the Denver Broncos, but the Chiefs’ offensive limitations ultimately resulted in a 20-13 loss.\n\nThis game was defined by four long Denver drives, one in each quarter. The first two came up short to produce a pair of Wil Lutz field goals, with gave the Chiefs a chance to hang around and counter with a touchdown on a short drive after a Bo Nix interception to make the score 7-6 at halftime.\n\nThe TD came on a 4-yard pass to running back Brashard Smith, and it was the first career touchdown bass for the Chiefs third-string quarterback, Chris Oladokun.\n\nThe Chiefs actually scored first in the third quarter after a pass interference penalty on Broncos cornerback Pat Surtain II in Denver territory led to a 53-yard field goal by Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker that made it 10-6.\n\nThe Broncos proceeded to drive the field again, and this time Nix was able to finish by running the ball in from nine yards out for Denver’s first touchdown of the night. That gave the Broncos the lead, 13-10, but the Chiefs were able to counter with yet another Butker field goal from 47 yards after a 44-yard punt return by Smith.\n\nDenver’s final drive of the game was the fourth one to last for at least 14 plays, and Nix finished the 65-yard effort with a one-yard touchdown pass to running back RJ Harvey. The key play in the drive was a defensive offside penalty by Chiefs tackle Chris Jones that gave Denver a critical red-zone first down that led to the score.\n\nIt’s remarkable that the Chiefs were even able to give themselves a chance in this one. Oladokun passed for just 66 yards on the night as he went 13-for-22, although he did remain turnover-free. The running game had some moments as the Chiefs were able to pick up some occasional first downs, but Kansas City was simply outgunned in this one due to their quarterback injury issues.\n\nThe highlight of the night for the Chiefs was the final drive, which featured some receiving highlights from Kelce, who put Kansas City on his back and nearly win the game single-handed. Kelce was eventually double-teamed, though, and a final pass to receiver Hollywood Brown in the end zone wound up being an overthrow tight as Denver survived.\n\nThe Broncos will move on to play the Los Angeles Chargers for the AFC West title next week, assuming the Chargers can beat the Houston Texans on Saturday. That will officially end the Chiefs’ run of division titles at nine, while the Chiefs will close out their broken season against the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 18.",

Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in November that her country's military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing says must come under its rule.\n\nTakaichi’s government, under U.S. pressure for a military increase, pledged to achieve the 2% target by March, two years earlier than planned.

It includes a 177 billion-yen ($1.13 billion) purchase of domestically developed and upgraded Type-12 surface-to-ship missiles with a range of about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles).\n\nThe first batch of the Type-12 missiles will be deployed in Japan's southwestern Kumamoto prefecture by March, a year earlier than planned, as Japan accelerates its missile buildup in the region.\n\nIn part due to Japan's aging and declining population and its struggles with an understaffed military, the government believes unmanned weapons are essential.\n\nTo defend the coasts, Japan will spend 100 billion yen ($640 million) to deploy “massive” unmanned air, sea-surface and underwater drones for surveillace and defense under a system called “SHIELD\" planned for March 2028, defense ministry officials said.\n\nFor speedier deployment, Japan initially plans to rely mainly on imports, possibly from Turkey or Israel.\n\nThe budget announcement comes as Japan’s row with China escalate following Takaichi's remark in November that Japanese military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its own.\n\nThe disagreement escalated this month when Chinese aircraft carrier drills near southwestern Japan prompted Tokyo to protest when Chinese aircraft locked their radar on Japanese aircraft, which is considered possible preparation for firing missiles.\n\nThe Defense Ministry, already been alarmed by China’s rapid expansion of operations in the Pacific, will open a new office dedicated to studying operations, equipment and other necessities for Japan to deal with China's Pacific activity.\n\nTwo Chinese aircraft carriers were spotted in June almost simultaneously operating near southern Japanese island of Iwo Jima for the first time, fueling Tokyo’s concern about Beijing’s rapidly expanding military activity far beyond its borders and areas around the disputed East China Sea islands.\n\nJapan plans joint development of frigates and jets\n\nJapan is pushing to strengthen its largely domestic defense industry by participating in joint development with friendly nations, and promoting foreign sales, after drastically easing arms export restrictions in recent years.\n\nFor 2026, Japan plans to spend more than 160 billion yen ($1 billion) to jointly develop a next-generation fighter jet with Britain and Italy for deployment in 2035. There also are plans for research and development of AI-operated drones designed to fly with the jet.\n\nIn a major boost to the country's defense industry, Australia selected Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in August to upgrade Mogami-class frigate to replace its fleet of 11 ANZAC-class ships.\n\nJapan's budget allocates nearly 10 billion yen ($64 million) to support industry base and arms sales.\n\nMeeting targets but future funding uncertain\n\nThe budget plan requires parliamentary approval by March to be implemented as part of a 122.3 trillion yen ($784 billion) national budget bill.\n\nThe five-year defense buildup program would bring Japan's annual spending to around 10 trillion yen ($64 billion), making it the world’s third-largest spender after the U.S. and China. Japan will clear the 2% target by March as promised, the Finance Ministry said.\n\nTakaichi’s government plans to fund its growing military spending by raising corporate and tobacco taxes and recently adopted a plan for income tax increase beginning 2027. Prospects for future growth at a higher percentage of GDP is unclear.",

    "description": "The North American Aerospace Defense Command has been tracking the location of Santa Claus for children since 1955.",
    "fullText": "It’s back! In what has become an annual ritual for millions on Christmas Eve, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, is tracking Santa Claus’s journey from the North Pole to deliver gifts to children across the globe.\n\nNORAD’s Santa Claus tracker website — NORADSanta.org — includes a map that allows users to track Santa’s location in real time. The site attracts tens of millions of visitors every year.\n\nBeginning at midnight on Christmas Eve, the site utilizes satellite mapping technology and digital animation to simulate the route of Santa’s reindeer and sleigh.\n\nThe tracker also features a live count of gifts delivered by Jolly Old St. Nick. At the time of this publication, that figure was more than 1.3 billion.\n\nThe practice began in 1955 when a child accidentally called the unlisted number of what was then the Continental Air Defense Command Operations Center, asking for Santa Claus.\n\nNot wanting to disappoint the young caller, Air Force Col. Harry Shoup, the command center’s director of operations, “instructed his staff to check the radar for indications of Santa making his way south from the North Pole,” according to NORAD. Each year since, NORAD has dutifully reported Santa’s location on Dec. 24 to millions of children and families.\n\nThe binational military organization, based in Colorado Springs, Colo., eventually enlisted volunteers to answer a dedicated phone line to give updates on Santa’s whereabouts. In recent years, those volunteers have included pop stars, presidents and first ladies.\n\nAnd the hotline still exists: You can call 877-HI-NORAD (877-446-6723) to reach one of the call center’s operators. (President Trump is scheduled to field NORAD Santa calls from Palm Beach, Fla., on Wednesday afternoon.) Last Christmas Eve, it logged more than 300,000 calls.\n\n📞 NORAD Tracks Santa Call Center Update\n\nWe’ve received more than 14,000 calls from families around the world so far today.\n\nOur volunteers are standing by, answering questions and sharing Santa’s latest location as he continues his journey. Thank you to everyone taking part in… pic.twitter.com/MNxTCCaZq4\n\n— NORAD Tracks Santa (@NoradSanta) December 24, 2025\n\nJust don’t ask when Santa will arrive at your house.\n\n“NORAD tracks Santa, but only Santa knows his route, which means we cannot predict where and when he will arrive at your house,” the organization explains on its FAQ page. “We do, however, know from history that it appears he arrives only when children are asleep!”",

    "title": "'A million choices': Lakers' defense will get a Christmas Day test vs. Rockets",
    "description": "Coach JJ Redick says the Lakers will not make all the correct choices, but \"can you make the vast majority of 'em correctly? It gives you a chance to win.\"",
    "fullText": "It’s not the lineups, the injuries or necessarily the system. The cause of the Lakers' defensive demise is a thousand little decisions gone wrong.\n\n“It comes down to just making the choice,” coach JJ Redick said after the Lakers gave up 132 points in a blowout loss to the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday. “It's making the choice. There's shortcuts you can take or you can do the hard thing and you can make the second effort or you can sprint back or you can't. It's just a choice and there's a million choices in a game, and you're very likely not gonna make every choice correctly. But can you make the vast majority of 'em correctly? It gives you a chance to win.”\n\nComing off back-to-back losses for the first time this season, the Lakers (19-9) are ranked 28th in defensive rating in the last 14 games entering a Christmas Day showcase against the Houston Rockets at 5 p.m. PST at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nThe Lakers, without any individual shutdown defenders, need a perfectly executed team defense to compete. But 15 different starting lineups in 28 games has delayed some of the team's ability to build continuity. The Lakers have had their full complement of 14 standard contract players for two games.\n\nForward Rui Hachimura (groin) and Luka Doncic (leg) could return Thursday. Guard Gabe Vincent, one of the team’s top defensive options on the perimeter, will miss his fourth game with lower-back soreness. Center Jaxson Hayes tweaked his left ankle in the second quarter of Tuesday’s loss and didn’t return.\n\nThe Rockets (17-10) limp into the Christmas Day blockbuster with their own struggles. The team thought to be one of the few who could challenge Oklahoma City in the West has lost five of its last seven games. Three of the losses were in overtime and four came against teams currently out of the play-in picture, including Tuesday’s loss to the Clippers.\n\nLed by Kevin Durant’s 25.2 points, the Rockets are a statistical anomaly in the sped up, possession-maximizing modern NBA. They have the third-ranked offense in the league despite being one of the slowest. They shoot the fewest three-pointers per game, but make them at a 40% clip that ranks second, and dominate the glass with NBA-leading 48.7 rebounds and 16.1 offensive rebounds per game.\n\nHouston’s physicality and expertise on the boards could be especially worrisome for a team that still has to consciously choose defense on a possession-by-possession basis instead of consistently living up to a standard of playing hard.\n\n“There's really no defense, no scheme we can do when we're giving up offensive rebounds in crucial moments like we are, our [opponents] are getting wherever they want on the court,” guard Marcus Smart said after Tuesday’s loss. “And there's no help, there's no resistance, there's no urgency. … It's on us.”\n\nThe Suns grabbed 12 offensive rebounds against the Lakers on 35 missed shots, an offensive rebounding rate of 34.3%. After the Suns scored a three-pointer by twice grabbing offensive rebounds off tipped balls, Lakers players had an animated discussion in a timeout with Smart was gesturing toward center Deandre Ayton about tipping rebounds. Ayton, who finished with 10 rebounds and 12 points, and Smart ended the timeout with a high-five.\n\n“[I need to] just continue to talk to guys, even though sometimes they might not want to hear it,” said Smart, a free-agent addition the Lakers coveted for his leadership and tenacity on defense. “Especially when we losing, nobody wants to hear it, myself included, but also understand that it's integral for us to hear those things, to see and to be able to talk to one another and figure it out as players on the court, because we're the ones out there.”\n\nRedick intentionally built in moments for players to connect and communicate during every timeout this season before coaches speak. The strategy was meant to encourage players to take a larger leadership role. “Championship communication” was one of the team’s three pillars.\n\nAlong with “championship shape,” Redick also asked his team to build “championship habits.” Living up to the mantras is easier said than done.\n\n“It's not the easy choice,” Redick said. “It's human nature. … We do it on a daily basis. We make easy choices cause it's comfortable. Comfortable doesn't win.”\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "The Arizona Cardinals have a matchup this week against a terrible Bengals defense. The question is who will start at running back and wide receiver.",
    "fullText": "In Week 17, a struggling Arizona Cardinals offense will meet a common salve: the Cincinnati Bengals defense.\n\nThat group might be the worst single unit in the NFL. If not, it’s in a tight race with the Raiders offense. The Bengals rank 32nd in points allowed, 32nd in yards per game and 32nd in yards per play. For those needing a refresher, the NFL still has 32 teams.\n\nSo, the question is: Outside of Trey McBride, which Cardinals players will be in position to take advantage?\n\nAt wide receiver, the picture is complicated.\n\nMarvin Harrison Jr. returned to action last week after missing two games with a heel injury, but he remained limited, playing just 51% of snaps and 62% of passing plays. His three targets matched a career low, outside of the two games that he has exited with concussions.\n\nEarlier in the week, head coach Jonathan Gannon was asked how Harrison emerged from the game and offered a mixed response.\n\n“Okay,” Gannon said. “I think he'll be ready for more. We'll see how it kinda goes here. Obviously, we had a plan for his reps, where he was at health wise. I know he wants to play more. So we'll see where he's at. Take it day by day.”\n\nOffensive coordinator Drew Petzing also acknowledged that Harrison is not at full strength.\n\n“Does it limit some of the things you're gonna do or some of the reps he's gonna get?” Petzing said. “Yes, maybe, at times.”\n\nBut despite Harrison’s limited role, his return still led to a decreased involvement for Michael Wilson.\n\nIn four games without Harrison, Wilson has averaged 10 catches on 15 targets for 125 yards. In the past two games that Harrison has played, those averages have dropped to three catches on five targets for 44 yards.\n\nGannon, though, noted that the Falcons prioritized taking away the Cardinals’ passing attack in last week’s game. They played cover-4 on 45.5% of snaps, roughly double the season-long rate of cover-4 that the Cardinals have faced. That was reflected in the target distribution, as 69% of Jacoby Brissett’s targets went to tight ends and running backs.\n\nThe Bengals deploy cover-4 at just a 5.2% rate, opening more opportunities for outside receivers. With Harrison still working through his heel injury, that could enable Wilson’s production to tick back up.\n\nAs expected, Michael Carter led the Cardinals' backfield in Week 16, following Bam Knight’s season-ending injury.\n\nCarter’s role, though, was smaller than anticipated. He saw 11 of the Cardinals’ 22 running back carries and played just 53% of snaps.\n\nEmari Demercado took five carries on a 32% snap share while Corey Kiner took six carries on a 16% snap share.\n\nBut when asked whether he anticipated Kiner seeing six carries again this week, Petzing instead took the opportunity to praise Carter.\n\n“I think it can always change based on the flow of the game and riding the hot hand and who's producing,” Petzing said. “I thought Michael did a really nice job in the run game, producing some explosive run gains. Really making some decisive runs and even some dirty runs that maybe were gonna be two or three-yard runs, turned them into four, five, six-yard runs.”\n\nAll nine of Kiner’s snaps came on one second-quarter drive, spelling Carter. That drive just happened to be the Cardinals’ longest of the game, at 13 plays, giving him more carries than expected.\n\nAs for Demercado, 17 of his 18 snaps either came on third-and-long or in end-of-half situations. That has been his role all season, as the Cardinals prefer to deploy him on passing downs.\n\nSo, what does that mean against the Bengals?\n\nCarter will likely be the early-down back, with Demercado playing passing downs and Kiner offering a change-of-pace option. If the Cardinals are leading, Carter could be more involved, while Demercado will see more usage if they find themselves trailing, as is typically the case.\n\nBut if the Bengals opt for a more typical defensive gameplan than the Falcons did — with fewer light boxes and shell coverages ­— the Cardinals could struggle to replicate their run efficiency. Their 5.7 yards per carry last week were their second most of the season.\n\nFor the second consecutive year, tight end Trey McBride and safety Budda Baker were the only two Cardinals’ players named to the Pro Bowl. Edge rusher Josh Sweat was named as an alternate.\n\nMcBride is having one of the best tight end seasons in NFL history, with 109 catches for 1,098 yards and 10 touchdowns. With eight more catches, he would set the single-season record for catches by a tight end.\n\nBaker, meanwhile, has taken a step back from his typical elite-level play. He is among the league leaders in missed tackles and has not stopped as many run plays at or near the line of scrimmage — partially due to a thumb injury that has forced him to play with a cast. But he’s been one of the league’s most impactful defensive players for the past decade, a status that often earns players Pro Bowl recognition even in down seasons.\n\nMcBride and Baker were both on the Cardinals’ roster when the current staff was hired in 2023. That means that general manager Monti Ossenfort has not acquired a Pro Bowler in his three seasons in charge, unless Sweat is added to the roster.\n\nOssenfort was the only general manager hired in 2023 but, as a comparison, eight general managers were hired in 2021 or 2022. All eight acquired at least one Pro Bowler in their first three seasons.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Assessing Cardinals' Michael Carter, Michael Wilson roles for Week 17",

    "fullText": "$161 for a seafood tower? Seems fishy.\n\nThat's what JPMorgan Chase's lawyers told a Delaware judge on Friday in an effort to get out of paying the rest of Charlie Javice's legal bill.\n\nThe bank sued Javice in late 2022, claiming that she and her cofounder, Olivier Amar, had faked data to inflate the value of their startup, Frank, which JPMorgan Chase paid $175 million to acquire. But Javice won an order requiring the bank to advance her legal fees, which is common in merger agreements.\n\nThree years later, JPMorgan claims that Javice and her lawyers have milked that order far past the point of what's reasonable. The 15 pounds of receipts submitted for reimbursement include high-end hotels, first-class flights, $530 in gummy bears, \"copious amounts of alcohol,\" and \"a $581 dinner for two that included a $161 seafood tower.\"\n\nThe bank's lawyers said Javice's lawyers continued to expense personal items into 2025, \"including a pet hair roller, laptop privacy screens, stain remover, allergy and cold medication, nutritional supplements, tea strainer, face masks, a coffee maker, lamps, a kettle, Uber rides for ordinary daily commute to a timekeeper's home office, 'groceries for meal prep,' bottles of wine, batteries, room upgrade charges at $300 per night, and meals at New York's best restaurants.\"\n\nIt blasted law firm Quinn Emanuel for a $60 Uber Eats order that included \"four cookies and a cookie box.\"\n\nQuinn Emanuel, which is representing Javice in the Delaware court case, said in a statement to Business Insider that JPMorgan \"is trying to walk away from its contractual obligation to pay Ms. Javice's legal bills.\" The bank is \"highlighting a handful of attorney expenses (not incurred by Ms. Javice) over two years, the vast majority of which it already reviewed and paid or are not disputed,\" Quinn Emmanuel spokesman Eric Herman said.\n\nThe bank also challenged the fees that Javice's lawyers charged for their time, as high as $2,700 per hour, including billing for trial attendance on a Saturday and other \"non-trial days.\"\n\nJPMorgan's lawyers said there were a total of 147 people — like lawyers and paralegals — who billed time to her defense, with the total bills across her criminal and civil cases crossing the $78 million mark. The bank said it has paid $60 million so far and says it shouldn't have to pay any more.\n\nMost of Javice's bills, $47 million, have been rung up by Quinn Emanuel, whose team was led by celebrity lawyer Alex Spiro and partner Samuel Nitze, who co-chairs Quinn's crisis law and strategy group. Another $14 million was billed by attorney Jose Baez, a trial lawyer who defended Casey Anthony; $5 million by his frequent co-counsel, the Harvard law professor Ronald Sullivan; and $11 million by Mintz, another big law firm.\n\nNearly all of the bills, $73 million, were incurred in Charlie Javice's criminal case. Javice was convicted of fraud and sentenced to seven years behind bars. The rest was incurred in civil cases. JPMC said Amar, the co-founder of Frank, who was sentenced to five years and eight months in prison, charged tens of millions of additional fees for his defense.",

    "fullText": "Jacob Rodriguez was sleeping on the floor of his brother’s apartment and learning how to really play defense when he joined Texas Tech for spring practice in 2022, right after a season as a quarterback at Virginia.\n\nSuddenly a walk-on on the other side of the ball, Rodriguez even wondered if he might get cut by the Red Raiders.\n\n\"They’re trying to weed everybody out because it’s coach (Joey) McGuire’s first offseason,\" he said. “So, I'm just out there trying to make the team and then focus on football. It was real weird, totally different position.”\n\nQB-turned-linebacker Rodriguez is now an AP All-American for fourth-ranked Tech, which is in the College Football Playoff for the first time. The team captain with a distinctive mustache, whose wife flies Black Hawk helicopters in the U.S. Army, has a collection of trophies for national defensive player of the year awards, and was fifth in the Heisman Trophy voting. He is the first FBS player in 20 years with at least five forced fumbles (he has seven), two fumble recoveries and four interceptions in the same season.\n\n“He’s just a man of consistency, a man of routine and he’s just a great leader overall,” said Tech senior edge rusher David Bailey, a first-year transfer and also an AP All-America first-teamer.\n\nThe Red Raiders (12-1), in McGuire's fourth season, play No. 5 Oregon (12-1) in the CFP quarterfinal Orange Bowl on New Year's Day. The first-time Big 12 Conference champions already have a school-record 12 wins.\n\nRodriguez won the Chuck Bednarik and Bronko Nagurski awards as the top defensive player, and the Dick Butkus Award as the top linebacker. He got the Lombardi Award that's for exceptional performance while embodying character and discipline like the award's namesake.\n\nRodriguez played a little bit of safety in high school, but when he got to Tech he hadn’t been a linebacker since middle school, when the approach was much different.\n\n“I had no clue what I was doing. I was just going see ball, hit ball,” he said. “You’re playing linebacker, but you don’t have to study film, and you don’t have to understand the position as much.”\n\nAs a prep starting quarterback, Rodriguez accounted for 10,136 total yards (7,085 passing, 3,051 rushing) and 106 touchdowns (68 passing, 38 rushing) as Wichita Falls Rider made the Texas Class 5A playoffs three years in a row. He was then an early enrollee at Virginia, which gave him a scholarship offer as a quarterback. He never threw a pass in his 12 games with the Cavaliers, but had 56 yards rushing and 65 receiving while used as a running back, receiver and tight end. He left there after a coaching change.\n\n“It’s just really cool to see the way that his story has developed, and the kind of guy that he is,” said fifth-year Tech quarterback Behren Morton, a fellow Texan who was in some of the same camps as Rodriguez before college. “He’s probably put on close to 50 pounds, and just totally transformed his body to looking like a mean linebacker.”\n\nRodriguez played special teams and some defensive packages during his Tech debut in 2022, when he had 29 tackles and began to embrace being on that side.\n\n“Really just knowing that I can make an impact whatever position I play. I’ve done it on the offensive side of the ball, I’ve done it on the defensive side of a ball, and I’ve done it on special teams. I can really play with anybody,\" he said. “That’s kind of when I figured I can do this. I saw myself progressing a lot on the defensive side of the ball, and week to week just getting better and better.”\n\nHe was limited to five games in 2023 after injuring his foot in the opener on a play that he forced and recovered a fumble. His 127 tackles last year were the most for a Tech player since Lawrence Flugence set an NCAA FBS record with 193 in 2002. He has 117 this season after Tech reportedly invested more than $7 million on transfers along the defensive front, including Bailey, second-team AP All-America interior lineman A.J. Holmes Jr., and third-teamer Lee Hunter.\n\nAs tough as Rodriguez is, the 6-foot-1, 235-pound linebacker said there is no doubt that his wife Emma is even tougher.\n\nThe high school sweethearts got married in July 2023. Emma graduated from the United States Military Academy and is now based at Fort Riley in Kansas.\n\n\"She's the best, and she does so much for me,\" Jacob Rodriguez said. \"It's weird, I feel like to everybody else, that we do long distance and have done it. But I mean to us, it’s normal. It’s something that we’ve always done.”\n\nWhile disappointed he didn't get an invitation to New York for the Heisman Trophy ceremony, Rodriguez was grateful and honored by the final results. His 17 first-place votes were nine more than Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin, the fourth-place finisher. Indiana QB Fernando Mendoza won the Heisman ahead of Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia and Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love.\n\n“I’m just so appreciative to even be in that conversation,\" Rodriguez said. \"That kind of hit home, was people really cared about me and see what the work that’s been done this year.”\n\nRodriguez has scored three touchdowns this season. He returned a fumble for a score against Oklahoma, and had short rushing TDs on his only carries when taking a direct snap in each of the last two regular-season games.\n\n“It was exciting and it was fun,” he said. “Those are the moments that I’ll never forget, where it’s just having fun playing football.”\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "fullText": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump is gathering with top national security officials on Monday, a meeting that comes as the U.S. Coast Guard steps up efforts to interdict oil tankers in the Caribbean Sea as part of the Republican administration's escalating pressure campaign on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's government.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Navy Secretary John Phelan are scheduled to join Trump, who is vacationing at his Mar-a-Lago resort, for what the White House called a \"major announcement.\" Trump plans to discuss a shipbuilding initiative at the event, according to a White House official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nBut Trump's gathering of key members of his national security team also comes at yet another inflection point in Trump's four-month pressure campaign on the Maduro government, which began with the stated purpose of stemming the flow of illegal drugs from the South American nation but has developed into something more amorphous.\n\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry has started evacuating the families of diplomats from Venezuela, according to a European intelligence official speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information.\n\nThe official told The Associated Press the evacuations include women and children and began on Friday. The official said Russian Foreign Ministry officials are assessing the situation in Venezuela in “very grim tones.” The White House and Kremlin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn the Caribbean, the U.S. Coast Guard on Monday continued for the second day to chase a sanctioned oil tanker that the Trump administration describes as part of a “dark fleet” Venezuela is using to evade U.S. sanctions. The tanker, the official added, is flying under a false flag and is under a U.S. judicial seizure order.\n\nIt is the third ship pursued by the Coast Guard, which on Saturday seized a Panama-flagged vessel called Centuries that U.S. officials said was part of the Venezuelan shadow fleet.\n\nThe Coast Guard, with assistance from the Navy, seized a sanctioned tanker called Skipper on Dec. 10, also part of the shadow fleet of tankers that the U.S. says operates on the fringes of the law to move sanctioned cargo. That ship was registered in Panama.\n\nTrump, after that first seizure, said the U.S. would carry out a “blockade” of Venezuela. Trump has repeatedly said that Maduro's days in power are numbered.\n\nLast week, Trump demanded that Venezuela return assets that it seized from U.S. oil companies years ago, justifying anew his announcement of a “blockade” against sanctioned oil tankers traveling to or from the South American country.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose agency oversees the Coast Guard, said in a Monday appearance on “Fox & Friends” that the targeting of tankers is intended to send “a message around the world that the illegal activity that Maduro is participating in cannot stand, he needs to be gone, and that we will stand up for our people.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Defense Department, under Trump's orders, continues its campaign of attacks on smaller vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean that it alleges are carrying drugs to the United States and beyond.\n\nAt least 104 people have been killed in 28 known strikes since early September. The strikes have faced scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and human rights activists, who say the administration has offered scant evidence that its targets are indeed drug smugglers and that the fatal strikes amount to extrajudicial killings.",

    "description": "Texas Tech football has a defense for the ages this season. The architect of the Red Raiders' next best defenses, Richard Bell, died this month.",
    "fullText": "The Texas Tech football team's average yield of 10.92 points per game this season would be a school record for scoring defense in the modern era, defined by the National Football Foundation as 1950 and later.\n\nOver the past 60 years, Tech's next five stingiest defenses by average points allowed came in the five consecutive seasons from 1970-74. Those are the years Richard Bell was the Red Raiders' defensive coordinator, or head defensive coach, as he was commonly referenced.\n\n\"Oh, wow,\" said Tommy Cones, a Red Raiders defensive end who lettered from 1972-74. \"Well, that tells you a lot right there. Numbers don't lie, right?\"\n\n\"That's amazing. That's amazing,\" said Gaines Baty, a defensive end who lettered from 1970-72. \"Well, he was known across the country as a defensive expert.\"\n\nBell died on Dec. 13 in Woodstock, Georgia. He was 88.\n\nMore: Texas Tech football's Jacob Rodriguez on Heisman vote, awards circuit\n\nHis passing prompted reflection among those who played under him.\n\n\"Richard Bell was the epitome of character, integrity, intensity, passion and excellence,\" Baty said. \"He set a high standard for the football team, as well as personally for every player on that team.\"\n\nBell came to Texas Tech from West Virginia with head coach Jim Carlen in 1970 and followed Carlen to South Carolina after the 1974 season. Tech and Vanderbilt played to a 6-6 tie in the Peach Bowl on Dec. 28, 1974, before Vandy coach Steve Sloan switched programs. Late on New Year's Eve, Sloan announced he was staying at Vanderbilt, but he changed his mind and accepted the Texas Tech job on New Year's Day.\n\nThe next day, the Avalanche-Journal reported Bell, according to Texas Tech insiders, \"would have landed the job had Sloan not reconsidered during the wee hours of New Year's morn.\"\n\nBell was a college head coach for only one year, going 4-7 in 1982 at South Carolina.\n\nHis long coaching career included stints as defensive coordinator at West Virginia (1968-69), Texas Tech (1970-74), South Carolina (1975-81), Duke (1983-87), East Carolina (1988), Georgia (1989-93), Navy (1994) and Air Force (1995-2006). The Arkansas native was a captain on Frank Broyles' first Razorbacks team in 1958 and made early coaching stops at Virginia Military (1962-63) and Georgia Tech (1964-67).\n\nHe worked under College Football Hall of Fame coaches Bobby Dodd and Fisher DeBerry at Georgia Tech and Air Force, respectively, and alongside Hall of Fame coach Bobby Bowden when Bowden was offensive coordinator at West Virginia.\n\nBefore leaving Georgia, Bell recruited a young defensive back named Kirby Smart.\n\n\"He just knew how to get the most out of every player,\" Cones said, \"and he had some really, really good pep talks. He was such a professional in terms of communicating, and you'd get really pumped up when he's your coach. He had a certain charisma about him. He would say the right thing, the things you wanted to hear before you went out to win a game for him.\"\n\nFormer Tech defensive tackle David Knaus described Bell as calm, controlled, thorough and confident. Knaus, an all-Southwest Conference honoree in 1973, said Bell's style was a polar opposite of Bill Parcells, who followed him as Tech defensive coordinator.\n\n\"Other than both of them being tremendous coaches, they couldn't have been more different in their styles,\" Knaus said. \"As an example, I never heard profanity ever uttered from coach Bell. He barely ever needed to raise his voice. It was always controlled correction.\"\n\nTech went 8-4 in 1970, holding opponents to 13.5 points per game. The Red Raiders slipped to 4-7 in 1971, though the defense yielded only 12.5 points per game, and defensive back Marc Dove was Southwest Conference defensive player of the year. Bell's units held opponents to 14.2 points per game in 1972, 15.3 in 1973 and 13.8 in 1974.\n\nThe 1972 team finished 8-4 with a Sun Bowl loss to North Carolina. The 1973 team finished 11-1 with a Gator Bowl conquest of Tennessee.\n\nWhile serving as the Red Raiders' defensive coordinator, Bell was position coach for defensive ends and linebackers. End Bruce Dowdy earned all-Southwest Conference recognition in 1970, linebacker Larry Molinare in 1971 and Cones in 1974.\n\n\"He took a lot of running backs and good athletes,\" Baty said, \"and turned them into linebackers and defensive ends. That was kind of his way to do it. He liked a good athlete that would hit you.\"\n\nBaty came to Tech as a running back, quickly moved to linebacker and then played his entire varsity career at defensive end. Noseguard Don Rives was a second-team all-American in 1972. In the spring before that season, Rives called Baty \"the best defensive end in this league\" and \"the most underrated player in this conference.\"\n\nTo the extent that was true, Baty chalked it up to his coach.\n\n\"He made me as a player,\" Baty said. \"Not that I was anything special, but whatever I was is because of Richard Bell.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Lubbock Avalanche-Journal: Remembering Richard Bell, Texas Tech football defensive coordinator",

    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos rolled into Week 16 against the Jacksonville Jaguars riding an 11-game win streak with visions of clinching the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs.\n\nThe Jaguars had other ideas. Sparked by another big game from quarterback Trevor Lawrence, the Jaguars steamrolled the vaunted Broncos' defense in Denver to secure a 34-20 win.\n\nWith the win, the Jaguars improve to 11-4 while turning the race for the No. 1 seed in the AFC into a five-team contest. The Broncos drop to 12-3, while the 11-4 Chargers, 11-4 Bills and 11-3 Patriots (ahead of Sunday night's game against the Ravens) all remain in the race for the first-round bye in the AFC playoff bracket.\n\nLawrence led the way while completing 23 of 36 passes for for 279 yards with 3 touchdowns and no interceptions. He added 20 yards and a fourth touchdown on the ground.\n\nThis, a week after Lawrence led a 48-20 romp over the Jets with 330 passing yards, 5 touchdowns and no turnovers. But that was against the Jets.\n\nSunday was against a Super Bowl-contending Broncos team with one of the best defenses in football. And if you weren't counting the Jaguars among Super Bowl contenders before, it's time to reconsider that stance.\n\nThe early portion of Sunday's contest was a back-and-forth affair that saw the Broncos tie the game at 17-17 early in the third quarter. But the tenor of the game took a dramatic shift on Jacksonville's first possession of the second half.\n\nSparked by a pair of big penalties, the Jaguars drove 75 yards for a touchdown. A roughing the passing penalty for bodyweight on a hit of Lawrence on first down moved the Jaguars across midfield and riled up the raucous Denver crowd.\n\nThen in the red zone on second down, the Broncos got flagged for pass interference in the end zone when Jahdae Barron grabbed Parker Washington's arm while the ball was in the air. This brought the home crowd into a frenzy.\n\nLawrence responded by running untouched into the end zone for 24-17 lead Jaguars lead.\n\nBack and forth we goooo@trevorlawrence | #JAXvsDEN on FOXpic.twitter.com/ySt0CgOLMW\n\n— Jacksonville Jaguars (@Jaguars) December 21, 2025\n\nThe Broncos had multiple chances to answer, but there was no Bo Nix magic in the second half this time.\n\nDenver punted after four plays on its ensuing possession. Following another Jaguars touchdown for a 31-17 lead, a botched handoff from Nix to Jaleel McLaughlin resulted in Denver's first turnover of the game. The Jaguars converted that fumble into a field goal for a 34-17 lead.\n\nThen with 8:08 remaining, Nix forced a sideline pass to Pat Bryant in tight coverage. Jarrian Jones was there for the interception to all but ice the Jacksonville win.\n\nBo Nix is intercepted by Jarrian Jones 👀\n\n📺 FOX pic.twitter.com/4pNMf0lkHU\n\n— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) December 21, 2025\n\nFor the day, Nix completed 28 of 47 passes for 352 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. He was credited with a lost fumble on the botched handoff in the third quarter. And the Jaguars finished the game with a 2-0 advantage in takeaways. Those turnovers ultimately tanked any hope of a Broncos comeback.\n\nEven with the loss, the Broncos maintain control of that No. 1 seed. Their 12-3 record remains alone atop the AFC. And they hold the tiebreaker over the Patriots if the Patriots win Sunday night.\n\nBut with two weeks remaining in the season, the race for that No. 1 seed is anything but settled. And the Chargers could still win the AFC West. The Broncos and Chargers will face off in Week 18, when the division title could be at stake.",

    "title": "Instant reaction: Broncos’ defense fizzles out as Jaguars route Denver 34-20",
    "description": "The Denver Broncos had their 11-game winning streak come to an end with their 34-20 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.",
    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos hosted the roaring Jacksonville Jaguars in their Week 16 matchup. A gridiron battle of two division leaders, this one was expected to be a close and hard-fought matchup. It turned out to be the opposite, with the Jaguars throttling the Broncos 34-20 and ending their 11-game winning streak. Here are some instant reactions and key takeaways from today’s game.\n\nPenalties, drops, and miscues plague Broncos’ offensive effort\n\nLast week against the Green Bay Packers, Bo Nix and the offense had one of their most complete games of the season. In order to defeat the Jaguars, they needed to replicate some of that success. Sadly, that was far from the case with only several good drives through sixty minutes of play.\n\nAfter struggling in the first quarter, they were able muster a quality scoring drive early on in the second quarter. A 15-yard fade to Courtland Sutton tied the game up. A few drives later, Wil Lutz was able to connect on a 54-yard field goal to give the Broncos a 10-7 lead—but that was short-lived with Denver being down 17-10 at halftime.\n\nDenver’s first drive of the second half couldn’t have gone any better. Rookie running back RJ Harvey broke a few tackles and dove for the pylon to cap off a 38-yard touchdown scamper that tied the game up at 17. It was an absolutely marvelous play by the second-round pick. After that? There wasn’t much to write home about.\n\nThree-and-outs and stalled drives were a theme for the Broncos thereafter. A failed handoff exchange between Nix and Jaleel McLaughlin late in the third quarter was the straw that broke the camel’s back with Denver already down 31-17. In the fourth quarter down 34-20, Nix threw an interception on fourth down that officially ended any hopes of a miracle comeback.\n\nPenalties, drops, turnovers, and miscues all played a culprit in the Broncos’ regression on offense against the Jaguars. Ther only bright spot on offense was Harvey’s performance. It was in a losing effort, but over 120 all-purpose yards and a touchdown is praiseworthy. The team will continue to need him to play at a high level in the final weeks of the season to help secure the division title and top seed in the AFC.\n\nJarrian Jones picks off Nix!\n\nJAXvsDEN on FOX/FOX Onehttps://t.co/HkKw7uXnxV pic.twitter.com/F9MjGz2RRZ\n\nDefense fails to show up in worst performance of the season\n\nThe Jaguars entered today’s contest averaging well over 30 points a game since their bye week. Both Trevor Lawrence and Travis Etienne were on hot streaks. It was a big task for the Broncos to slow them down. Unfortunately, they struggled all game long and had their worst performance of the year. It was ugly throughout four quarters.\n\nOne area of concern I had was how safety P.J. Locke would hold up in coverage. He surrendered a touchdown reception to tight end Brenton Strange in the second quarter—aided by a clear push off by Strange. However, he was also targeted often on the Jaguars’ scoring drive right before halftime and also in the second half. It’s clear that Brandon Jones’ presence in the backend of Denver’s secondary was sorely missed.\n\nOn top of that, Lawrence was able to light up the Broncos’ red zone defense. Entering today’s game, Denver’s red zone defense was best in the NFL in ‘25 and a huge strength. Today? They gave up four touchdowns in Jacksonville’s first four trips inside the 20. That’s certainly not a recipe for success. It was Murphy’s Law for the Broncos on defense this afternoon.\n\nMissed tackles, missed coverage assignments, and penalties hampered Denver’s ability to thwart Jacksonville’s offensive endeavors. The Jaguars were routinely able to create yards after the catch and blow past Broncos defenders. It’s been a long time since we have seen them play this poorly. But perhaps a wakeup call was eventually in order. It’s really not worth mentioning ‘elite’ and this defense in the same sentence any longer.\n\nAfter multiple weeks of showing concerning weaknesses, all of the Broncos’ biggest flaws were exposed today. With only two games remaining before the playoffs, the team doesn’t have long to correct them. If they can’t, their hopes of a strong postseason push may be in jeopardy. Defensive Coordinator Vance Joseph and his players have their work cut out for them.\n\nThis Bronco Defense is all kinds of out of sorts. \n\nBusting coverages, not setting edges, no QB player on obvious Zone Read situations. \n\nTrevor Lawrence & Liam Cohen continue to punch the bruise. \n\nThe Brandon Jones loss looms larger than I would have expected.\n\n— Coach Mike Sanford (@Coach_Sanford2) December 21, 2025\n\nDenver can’t let this loss linger. Recalibrate and beat the Chiefs on Christmas.\n\nAll good things come to an end. It’s been an awesome season for the Broncos, but their eleven-game winning streak is now over. Getting pummeled at home by the Jaguars wasn’t on the radar for me. I thought the Broncos would win in a close game.\n\nA huge credit to Jacksonville for being the better team today. They executed a great gameplan on both sides of the ball. They also delivered Denver their first loss at home since October of last season. That’s pretty wild when you think about it.\n\nThat being said, the Broncos can’t afford to dwell on this loss and let it linger. They need to shift gears quickly and be prepared to defeat the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium on Christmas. There usually isn’t a good way to spin a loss, but this sort of adversity might be important for the Broncos to experience before the postseason hits.\n\nIt can serve as a bit of a reality check for them. Moreover, it’s certainly a woeful performance where there will be ample tape to show what they need to correct and improve upon. The next two games are against division rivals. They are must-win games for Denver to win the AFC West and find a way to edge out the competition for that coveted first-round bye and homefield advantage that comes with the #1 seed.\n\nWill the Broncos be able to show some tenacity and resiliency over the next two weeks? I sure hope so. So much is at stake. Let’s hope they can finish off the season strong with back-to-back wins. Although it isn’t going to be easy, especially with Pat Bryant and Dre Greenlaw being injured late in today’s game.\n\nProbably a good time to note that the Broncos can lose today and still get the No. 1 seed with 2 wins.\n\nAnd also that every time they've won the SB they've had back-to-back December losses. (Not saying you want that here, because that means losing to a KC team w/ its No. 3 QB)\n\n— Andrew Mason (@MaseDenver) December 21, 2025",

    "fullText": "GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Bijan Robinson gained 171 yards from scrimmage and had a touchdown catch, Kirk Cousins threw two TD passes and ran for a score, and the Atlanta Falcons held on to beat the Arizona Cardinals 26-19 on Sunday.\n\nThe Falcons (6-9) won for the second straight week, with both coming on the road.\n\nArizona's defense made a fourth-down stop at its own 40-yard line with 2:05 left, setting up a chance to tie the game or take the lead, but Atlanta's C.J. Henderson made a diving interception of Jacoby Brissett's pass with 1:30 remaining to seal it.\n\nRobinson had 92 yards receiving on seven catches, including a 13-yard touchdown, and added 76 yards rushing on 16 carries. The 23-year-old became the third player in franchise history to gain at least 2,000 yards from scrimmage in a season, joining Jamal Anderson (1998) and William Andrews (1981 and 1983).\n\nArizona (3-12) has lost seven straight and 12 of 13 since starting the season 2-0.\n\nThe Falcons pushed ahead 26-16 early in the fourth quarter when Cousins scored on a 1-yard run, which capped a 12-play, 66-yard drive. Arizona cut the deficit to 26-19 with 4:37 left on Chad Ryland's 34-yard field goal, taking advantage of Cousins' fumble at midfield.\n\nBrissett completed 16 of 31 passes for 203 yards with a touchdown and an interception. The veteran has a 1-9 record as the Cardinals' starter since taking over for the injured Kyler Murray in Week 6.\n\nArizona tight end Elijah Higgins had 91 yards receiving on seven catches.\n\nAtlanta rallied from an early 10-point deficit to tie the game at 16-all heading into halftime. Cousins hit Kyle Pitts for an 11-yard touchdown with 25 seconds left in the second quarter. Calais Campbell, Arizona's 39-year-old defensive end, blocked the extra-point attempt to keep the Falcons from taking the lead.\n\nArizona tried a 50-yard field goal to take the lead just before the break, but Ryland's kick was no good, bouncing off the right upright.\n\nRyland also missed a 44-yard attempt in the third quarter wide right.\n\nThe Cardinals took a 10-0 lead midway through the first quarter after Michael Wilson made a circus catch for a 32-yard touchdown. Falcons cornerback Cobee Bryant and Wilson tumbled into the end zone as they fought for possession and the ball bounced between them, eventually settling between Wilson's legs without hitting the ground.\n\nCardinals: CB Max Melton (heel), LT Paris Johnson Jr. (knee) and S Jalen Thompson (hamstring) were among six inactives. ... CB Garrett Williams (Achilles tendon) left in the first quarter and had to be carted off the field after the non-contact injury. ...

    "fullText": "ATLANTA (AP) — Trae Young is quickly returning to his All-Star form after missing 21 games with a knee injury.\n\nNow, the Atlanta Hawks can shift their focus to healing their ailing defense.\n\nThe Hawks ranked 22nd in scoring defense before Sunday's 152-150 loss to the Chicago Bulls in the NBA's highest-scoring game this season.\n\nThe Bulls had nine scorers in double figures, led by Matas Buzelis with 28 points. The Bulls' 152 points set a season high. They also set season highs with 41 assists, 57.6% field goal percentage and 47.6% 3-point shooting (20 of 42).\n\nYoung scored a season-high 35 points with nine assists. Jalen Johnson had 36 points with 11 rebounds and nine assists.\n\nThe Hawks also had Onyeka Okongwu score 23 points and Vit Krejci add 20. Young's encouraging showing and all the offense wasn't enough to overcome the leaky defense. The Bulls set another season high by scoring 83 points in the first half.\n\n“It’s kind of tough winning games when you give up 80 points in the first half,” Johnson said. “It’s kind of embarrassing in a sense. …. Hopefully we cut down on some of the things we’re doing.”\n\nThe Hawks (15-15) have lost three straight and seven of nine to fall back to .500.\n\nYoung started for the second time in three games after missing 21 games with a right MCL sprain.\n\n“I think everybody is excited to have Trae back,” Johnson said. “He’s been out for a while. ... The fact he’s found his rhythm already in his second game is a good sign.”\n\nCoach Quin Snyder said Young may need more time before he's ready to play back-to-back games.\n\nYoung logged 26 minutes against Chicago, which he said was his limit for his second game back.\n\n“I feel amazing,” Young said. “They did their job, put me right at 26 minutes. They weren’t allowing me to do any more. ... I feel great.”\n\nYoung led the NBA in assists last season and is a four-time All-Star. He scored only eight points in 20 minutes in his first game back, a 133-126 loss at Charlotte on Thursday night. He was back in his high-scoring form against Chicago but missed a last-second jumper that would have tied the game.\n\n“Those are shots that he makes,\" Snyder said. “You feel good about getting the ball in the right guy’s hands.”\n\nSnyder said the Hawks “had a lot of breakdowns in execution” on defense in the first half. The Bulls scored 69 points in the second half and made 54.3% of their shots from the field, but Snyder said his defense “did a better job with that in the second half as far as making them work hard.”\n\nYoung said the high-scoring pace was no surprise.\n\n“It’s how both teams play,” Young said. \"Both teams play fast. Teams are coming in here and playing fast against us. We’ve got to figure out how to stop a team that can only play fast.'\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

    "fullText": "All eyes are on Myles Garrett this week as he is 1.5 sacks away from claiming the all-time NFL sack single-season record. He will be chasing that record this week, but beyond Garrett, the Cleveland Browns defense will be a huge factor in the game against the Buffalo Bills.\n\nWhile sacks will be a priority for Garrett, it is known that Josh Allen can extend plays with his legs, so the Cleveland pass rushers will need to prioritize limiting him in these situations rather than just aiming for sacks. If they can keep Allen in the pocket, they may be able to limit Buffalo’s explosive offense.\n\nThe Bills are built to score often and quickly, so limiting explosive plays will be crucial for the Browns’ defense. There needs to be an emphasis on tackling and limiting big gains that will allow Buffalo to move down the field quickly. Cleveland’s offense struggles when playing from behind, making it crucial for the defense to avoid putting the team in that situation.\n\nIn every game, third-down stops and stops in the red zone are always a key to keeping the Browns in games, and it is no different for this game. Limiting the Bills to field goals and forcing them to punt will keep the Browns competitive.\n\nLet me know what you think in the comments – What are the keys for the Browns defense in limiting the Bills offense?",

    "fullText": "Brian Billick explains why Houston’s defense feels championship ready originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThere are moments in the NFL when history doesn’t repeat itself so much as it clears its throat.\n\nThat is where the modern-day Houston Texans now stand. Not chasing ghosts. Not recreating something old. But quietly echoing a formula that once carried the Baltimore Ravens from uncertainty to a Lombardi Trophy.\n\nThe comparison is not built on nostalgia. It is built on structure.\n\nIn 2000, Baltimore won a Super Bowl with a defense that did not negotiate. It dictated. The Ravens entered the postseason as a wild card, survived a rocky stretch during the regular season, then caught fire when it mattered most. Seven straight wins to close the year. Three playoff victories that never felt competitive. A Super Bowl performance that removed all doubt.\n\nMORE: Shedeur Sanders ‘that’s on me’ after throwing three interceptions in loss to Bears\n\nHouston’s path has followed a familiar rhythm.\n\nThe Texans stumbled early, dropping three straight games and digging a hole that invited skepticism. The response was not panic. It was correction. Since then, Houston has ripped off six consecutive wins, with a seventh looming, and done it the same way Baltimore once did. By shrinking space. By tackling cleanly. By turning every possession into work.\n\nBack then, Brian Billick was only in his second season as a head coach. Today, DeMeco Ryans is in his third, presiding over a team that has discovered exactly who it is and why that matters.\n\nWhen asked by Sporting News about the resemblance, Billick didn’t reach for nostalgia. He went straight to mindset.\n\n“Our defense just had a mindset that went beyond their physical skills. What made them so great was their ability to tackle in the open field, you just didn’t get yards after contact in the open field, and you didn’t get big plays. We believed we could win a championship based upon that defense and keep in mind, that was at a time when the league was transitioning out of the Elway’s, Marino’s and Montana’s. We had a defensive based championship, just as Tampa and New England had the following seasons.”\n\nThat belief is the connective tissue.\n\nHouston’s defense does not rely on spectacle. It relies on discipline. Explosive plays are rare. Yards after contact are earned, not given. Opponents leave possessions feeling squeezed, frustrated, and behind schedule. That is not coincidence. That is identity.\n\nThe league has changed since 2000. The quarterbacks are bigger brands. The rules favor offense. The margins feel thinner. Yet the core truth remains unchanged. Defense still travels. Defense still stabilizes. Defense still gives teams permission to believe when everything tightens.\n\nBillick was also asked about winning a championship early in his tenure, something that once felt like an exception and now feels like an expectation.\n\n“You can win it all early at a place because of free agency and if you draft well. That’s honestly the expectation these days, win quickly and often.”\n\nThat statement feels almost prophetic in the modern NFL. Windows are no longer slow burns. They open suddenly. They close faster. Houston understands that.\n\nThis Texans team is not a finished product. Neither were the 2000 Ravens in September. What matters is not how they look in isolation, but how they are trending when games stop forgiving mistakes.\n\nHouston is not trying to become the 2000 Ravens. But the structure is there. The timing is there. And the defense is beginning to speak with the same authority.\n\nHistory is not calling them champions yet.\n\nKane Wommack says Alabama’s culture showed itself when the punches came\n\nThree Clemson defenders projected as first round picks in latest CBS Sports NFL mock draft\n\nWarren Sapp trends for all the wrong reasons as Colorado’s defensive line erodes amid mass exodus",

Coach Sean McKay and defensive coordinator Chris Shula went into a shell as the Rams lost the game to the Seahawks and any chance of a long playoff run.\n\nHow many more times do we need to see Emmanuel Forbes chasing a receiver because of a blown coverage or missing an assignment and giving up a big play. The secondary is the weak link in the Rams defense and he’s absolutely a broken link. Chris Shula, please put someone else back there. The mascot Rampage would be a better choice than Forbes.\n\nBill Plaschke writes of the Rams: \"Who's going to score on the persistent defense?\" Maybe the Lions with 34 points?\n\nWilliam P. Bekkala\nWest Hollywood\n\nBill Plaschke's Rams encomium is puzzling. During the course of the game I watched, Detroit moved through the Rams defense like Sherman through Georgia. This was, at best, park football. The first team that exploits the Rams defense as the Lions did and consistently moves the ball on offense will defeat the Rams.\n\nJust when the Rams thought that they solved their kicking situation, they lost another game because of a missed field goal. After the game, they must have been kicking themselves.\n\nIt looks like the Bills are going to win the Super Bowl, because Plaschke wrote, \"The Bills? Not ever.\"\n\nThose who think what the Dodgers are doing is sound financial decision-making only have to look a little in front of their noses. The Dodgers have now committed over a billion dollars in deferred salary. What happens when that bill becomes due? They will commit another billion in the same buy-it-now, pay-it-later mode.\n\nOther teams can’t and shouldn’t follow this lead, which eventually fans pay for in higher prices for everything Dodger related. We will have their management to thank for the impending 2027 MLB labor stoppage and no baseball at that time.\n\nJust when you think that things could not possibly get any worse in Westwood, UCLA athletic director Martin Jarmond adds five more years to Mick Cronin’s contract.\n\nKudos to the Knicks for apparently deciding not to hang a banner to signify their NBA Cup championship, despite not winning a title since 1973, whereas the Lakers have won 11 since that time. Hopefully new ownership of the Lakers will reverse course and take down the Lakers’ barren banner for their 2023 Cup championship.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times welcomes expressions of all views.

    "fullText": "Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing for his annual televised Q&A session, and a new poll shows Russians remain focused on two issues: the war and the economy.\n\nAccording to a poll of 1,608 Russians conducted by the independent Levada Center, the top two concerns Russians want to raise with Putin are when the war will end and how they're supposed to cope with a deteriorating economy.\n\nAbout a fifth of respondents said they would ask Putin when the war in Ukraine, which the Kremlin calls a \"special military operation,\" would end.\n\nRight behind the war is the economy, as another 16% say their top question is about living standards — salaries, pensions, and benefits.\n\nThese two concerns have topped Levada's polls ahead of Putin's annual Q&A for three years.\n\nBeyond the top concerns, Levada found that 8% of respondents want to ask Putin about price growth and tax hikes, 6% about utilities and social services, and 5% about the healthcare system.\n\nThe anxiety comes as Russia's inflation remains high, and the country's massive defense spending jostles with social spending.\n\nPutin's televised \"Direct Line\" Q&A session, scheduled for Friday, comes nearly four years after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, triggering sweeping Western sanctions.\n\nSince the invasion in February 2022, the Kremlin has steered the country onto a wartime economic footing.\n\nHeavy defense spending and state-directed investment have helped sustain headline economic growth, even as sanctions and export restrictions have reshaped trade flows.\n\nBut strains are showing: Energy export revenues have dropped in a softer oil-price environment, while high inflation continues to sap consumer demand.\n\nPrevious hourslong \"Direct Line\" broadcasts offer a preview of how Putin may handle the questions the Kremlin allows.\n\nLast year, Putin acknowledged that Russia's economy was overheating amid high inflation and warned citizens to brace for continued pressure.\n\nHowever, he deflected blame, suggesting that both the central bank and the Russian federal government — formally headed by the prime minister — could have acted more decisively to prevent the surge in prices and credit growth.\n\nPutin is also expected to hold an end-of-year news conference on Friday, where the spotlight will be on any signals he offers about the direction of the war.",

    "description": "Defense One first reported that the funding for those checks actually comes from reconciliation funds that were approved by Congress to subsidize housing allowances for service members.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is already facing backlash for his so-called “warrior dividend” he announced during his national address on Wednesday night.\n\nTrump announced that 1.45 million military servicemembers will be receiving a $1,776 check ahead of Christmas as a result of tariff revenue and his “big beautiful bill” signed earlier this year. But skeptics immediately questioned how Trump was able to authorize sending out individual checks to service members without approval from Congress.\n\n“1,450,000 military service members will receive a special, we call warrior dividend before Christmas, a warrior dividend. In honor of our nation’s founding in 1776, we are sending every soldier $1,776. Think of that. And the checks are already on the way,” Trump said during his speech.\n\n“We made a lot more money than anybody thought because of tariffs, and the bill helped us along. Nobody deserves it more than our military. And I say congratulations to everybody. And by the way, we now have record enlistment in our military, and last year we had among the worst recruitment numbers in our military’s history. What a difference a year makes,” he added.\n\nHowever, online publication Defense One first reported that the funding for those checks actually comes from reconciliation funds that were approved by Congress to subsidize housing allowances for service members.\n\nA senior administration official told Defense One that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed the Pentagon “disburse $2.6 billion as a one-time basic allowance for housing supplement” to all eligible service members.\n\n“Congress appropriated $2.9 billion to the Department of War to supplement the Basic Allowance for Housing entitlement within The One Big Beautiful Bill,” the senior official told Defense One in a statement. “Approximately 1.28 million active component military members and 174,000 Reserve component military members will receive this supplement.”\n\nOVERNIGHT: President Trump’s $1,776 checks for 1.45 million troops announced Wednesday night come from Congressionally-allocated reconciliation funds intended to subsidize housing allowances for service members, a senior official confirmed to @DefenseOne.https://t.co/mGWski9Exl\n\n— Thomas Novelly (@TomNovelly) December 18, 2025\n\nThe report immediately sparked criticism on social media platform X.\n\n“I was wondering how Trump found his troop pay money without a congressional authorization/appropriation. He found it by taking it away from troop housing money. Always a con artist,” The Atlantic’s David Frum wrote on X.\n\nFormer Rep. Joe Walsh wrote: “Classic Trump. Everything he does is a lie, everything he does is just bullshit repackaging.”\n\nMeidasTouch editor-in-chief Ron Filipkowski posted: “Trump is taking money out their housing allowances approved by Congress and giving it to them in a ‘bonus’ so it looks like it came from him. It’s just a shell game with military pay from the ultimate con man.”\n\nNew Jersey Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D) said the “warrior dividend” is “no more than rebranded military housing allowances.”\n\n“Trump isn’t giving our brave service members a bonus, he’s just shuffling around money so he can claim he is. The level of disrespect for the intelligence of our troops is staggering,” she wrote on X.\n\nU.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), a veteran, also bashed Trump’s announcement.\n\n“Gee thanks, Donald. Your $1,776 ‘warrior checks’ aren’t Christmas bonuses—you’re just stealing money out of a fund meant to help our troops find affordable housing. Once a conman always a conman,\" Duckworth wrote.",

    "fullText": "After a whole month of controversy with former head coach Lane Kiffin, the Ole Miss Rebels are finally back on the playing field, hoping to continue the best season in program history.\n\nThey face a familiar matchup this weekend against a Tulane team that they blew out 45-10 earlier this year, and should cruise through their first round College Football Playoff game on Saturday.\n\nThey’re a significant favorite and deservedly so. They outgained the Green Wave by nearly 250 yards in the first matchup, while completely shutting down their passing attack. Offensively, Trinidad Chambliss and Co. were dominant, throwing for over 300 yards while getting 241 more on the ground.\n\nOle Miss scored on eight of its first nine possessions, and Tulane just had no answers defensively. But, the blowout win did show a glaring concern: Ole Miss’s run defense.\n\nThe Rebels could not contain the Tulane ground game, as the Green Wave went for 178 yards on 4.6 yards per carry. And that wasn’t a one-game problem.\n\nAfter being a dominant force up front in 2024, ranking first in rushing yards allowed per game (85.1) and in yards allowed per carry (2.4), Ole Miss has significantly slipped this season. They rank 71st in rushing yards allowed per game (157.1), while being 92nd in yards allowed per carry (4.7).\n\nNow, the issue hasn’t shown up as much this year because Ole Miss’s offense has been elite, and the pass defense has been a top-30 unit in the country this year.\n\nBut, in Ole Miss’s close games this season, they struggled to defend the run. Against Kentucky early in the year, they allowed 172 rushing yards and 4.6 yards per carry. Arkansas went for 221 yards and four scores on six yards per carry in Ole Miss’s 41-35 win. Washington State had 127 yards on 4.5 yards a carry. Oklahoma went for 136 yards and two scores on nearly five yards a carry.\n\nThen, there’s Georgia, who went for 221 yards and a touchdown on the ground in Ole Miss’s lone loss of the year. And that’s who the Rebels will play in the second round of the Playoff, assuming they beat Tulane.\n\nNow, the Rebels are still a stellar 11-1 in the SEC. They’ve managed to win behind that elite defense and good pass defense. And they should run through Tulane this weekend, whose defense can’t keep up with Ole Miss.\n\nBut, if there’s a reason why Ole Miss’s magical season might end earlier than fans hope, it’s the run defense, which can certainly be a prevalent issue against the top teams in the country.",

    "description": "Wind is going to be a factor. So is the multiple defense coach Mike Macdonald will have against Sean McVay’s Rams offense.",
    "fullText": "Biggest game of the year. Biggest game yet for Sam Darnold with his Seahawks.\n\nWhat’s Seattle’s quarterback doing to prepare best for the Los Angeles Rams and this NFC West Battle Royale Thursday night at Lumen Field for the division lead and inside track to the top seed plus bye in next month’s conference playoffs?\n\n“To be honest, I’m not up all-night studying,” Darnold said of the three days between the Seahawks’ win over Indianapolis and this showdown between two 11-3 teams. “It’s making sure that I get my sleep, get my recovery in, because it is such a short week.”\n\nThere could be a lot for Darnold to study, in an effort to spring surprises on the Rams.\n\nYet Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald and offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak have spent this week balancing installing new plays in the game plan the Rams haven’t seen on film this season versus not overloading Seattle’s players with too much. The coaches want their Seahawks to play fast, to not think about too much new they crammed into the players’ heads Monday into Thursday this week. The Seahawks — and the Rams, for that matter — have been practicing plays for weeks if not months they’ve yet to use in a game, to surprise their opponent with new looks in the first Thursday night in NFL history feature two teams with 11 or more wins.\n\nThat’s the first key to this game: Be new, but while playing fast.\n\n“I think you could use it to your advantage,” Macdonald said of the short week. “If you’re decisive in how you want to operate and they’re the right decisions, I think that’ll help you. Sometimes, it might be behind the 8-ball.\n\n“A kick in the butt doesn’t necessarily hurt you.”\n\nSo what’s the new that will be key Thursday night?\n\nLook for Macdonald to use the combination of rookie Nick Emmanwori at all three levels of the defense with Pro Bowl cornerback Devon Witherspoon blitzing more and Seattle’s recent three-cornerback rotation with Riq Woolen and Josh Jobe giving the Seahawks new personnel options against coach Sean McVay’s Rams offense.\n\nNo team in the league plays in “13” personnel — one running back, three tight ends — more than McVay’s Rams, 25% of the time; the league average is 5%. No team played the Rams’ “13” personnel with nickel and an extra, fifth defensive back more than the Seahawks did last month in L.A.’s 21-19 home win.\n\nRams No. 2 wide receiver Davante Adams, the NFL’s leader with 14 touchdown receptions, is doubtful to play because of an injured hamstring. That may lead McVay to even more “13” personnel sets.\n\nThe Rams average 6.1 yards per play in their three-tight ends formations this season. Against Macdonald’s Seahawks last month L.A. got just 2.7 yards in McVay’s “13” personnel.\n\nIn all formations, Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford had by one measure the worst game of his 17-year NFL career last month against Seattle. His expected points added (EPA) passing in that game was the lowest of his career.\n\nMcVay’s offense had its lowest EPA in two seasons last month against Macdonald’s Seahawks defense. Can Seattle do it again?\n\nThe weather is forecast to be conducive to running over throwing the ball: A 50% chance of rain with winds 15 mph gusting toward 35 mph around the 5:15 p.m. kickoff, then throughout the game.\n\n“Yeah, it’ll factor into some of the decisions that we make,” Macdonald said, grinning to conceal exactly which ones.\n\nKubiak has shown he’s going to run the ball, regardless of the results. Seattle gained just 49 yards last week against the Colts, a top-10 run defense in the NFL. Yet the Seahawks ran it 22 times. No team in the league comes close to running it as often as Seattle’s 48% of all offensive plays. Yet the Seahawks are fifth-to-last with just 3.9 yards per rush.\n\nLast week, they ran for a season low 2.3 yards per carry against Indianapolis.\n\nThe Rams are ninth in the league in rushing defense.\n\n“I think it’s got to improve pretty quick,” Kubiak said of the Seahawks running game.\n\n“We’ve got to move the ball better on the ground. We’ve got to coach better. We’ve got to block better. We’ve got to help the operation by being a more balanced team.”\n\nExpect a pointed effort by Kubiak handing the ball to lead back Kenneth Walker early and often. Walker had 2.4 yards per rush in the last two games (19 carries, 46 yards). He’s had defenders standing waiting for him in the backfield immediately as he receives handoffs from Darnold.\n\nThursday, Walker is going to be running behind a new left tackle: Josh Jones is making his first Seattle start, for injured Charles Cross.\n\nThe Seahawks drove inside the Rams’ 20-yard line four times in that November game in Inglewood, California. They got just one touchdown out of those four red-zone trips.\n\nLast week against the Colts the Seahawks were 0 for 2 scoring TDs in the red zone. Seattle’s offensive moved inside the Indianapolis 35 four times. Yet the only offense was a team-record six field goals by Jason Myers in the 18-16 escape win.\n\nFor the season, the Seahawks are in the bottom half of the NFL, 17th in the 32-team league, in red-zone TD percentage (57.5%). They’ve been just 37.5% the last three weeks, the fourth-worst in the NFL in that span.\n\nMinimize penalties. Eliminate negative plays. And of course be far better than the career-high four interceptions Darnold threw in the last game against the Rams, handing L.A. two of their three touchdowns.\n\nThe Seahawks must score touchdowns, seven points, instead of field goals when they get close against L.A.\n\n“Again, the last few games moving the ball up and down the field, I feel like we’ve been solid,” Darnold said. “Third downs can improve a little bit— or a lot, I think I should say. Then in the red zone, it’s a matter of keeping the ball moving forward.\n\n“When you get in those second and long, third and longs, that makes it hard to convert. So, just keeping the ball moving forward, not only in the red zone, but also in the field, as well.”\n\nYes, this is one of the biggest regular-season games Seattle’s played in a minute. The winner is two more wins from the NFC West title and home-field plus a bye in the conference playoffs, meaning two home postseason games from the Super Bowl. The loser is headed to the fifth seed, and needing to win three road playoff games to reach the Super Bowl.\n\nYet the Seahawks coach doesn’t see it in that lens.\n\n“Look, I get it. It’s your job to put all the meaning behind it,” Macdonald said.\n\n“It’s our job to go play great football.\n\n“It’s all good, and I get it. It’s exciting. But every game’s exciting.” Darnold doesn’t turn the ball over. Walker gets (some) more than he’s gotten recently on the ground. Macdonald’s defense again stymies McVay’s offense with new tricks.",

    "fullText": "Palmer Luckey wants you to know he was right all along.\n\nThe outspoken billionaire and new-age god of war is making a fortune selling weapons. His reach extends beyond the range of his powerful artillery though, as he has shifted the narrative around what working in defense tech means.\n\nOnce a somewhat taboo corner of the business world, the success of Luckey's Anduril Industries, along with his no-holds-barred approach to … just about everything, has made him the poster child for tech's new love affair with the military, writes BI's Julia Hornstein.\n\nLuckey's now on a victory lap of sorts as he shepherds the US into a new era where one of the biggest business battlefields is the literal battlefield.\n\nPart of Luckey's appeal in tech circles might be his authenticity.\n\nWhether you love him or hate him, the 33-year-old has stuck to his guns over the years. That's unlike most of his tech peers, who have shifted their businesses and policies to favor whichever political party is in power. (Luckey once said he wrote President Donald Trump a letter when he was 15, encouraging him to run for president.)\n\nAt times, that dedication has come at a cost. Luckey has long claimed he was fired from Meta in 2017 for supporting Trump. Meta denies he left over politics.\n\nBut these days it's all sunshine and rainbows cruise missiles and drones for Luckey.\n\nPalmer Luckey might be the face of defense tech, but he's got plenty of competition.\n\nFirst and foremost, there's more money than ever in the space thanks to the Trump administration leaning into defense spending.\n\nThe latest era of modern warfare is also creating new opportunities. The increased prominence of drones, as evident in the war in Ukraine, has given startups a chance to step up to the plate. It has created an interesting dynamic, with young, agile startups competing with traditional defense contractors.\n\nThe increased competition is largely viewed as a positive for the government, which can benefit from better pricing. The new players and cutting-edge tech are also speeding up processes.\n\nThe Navy said a Palantir-powered AI system for shipbuilding cut a 160-hour job to just 10 minutes. The Army is also enacting a \"fail fast\" approach to weapon development.\n\nMoving at such speed, a staple of Silicon Valley, comes with risks when dealing with such powerful and dangerous tech. A new watchdog report said the US military needs to improve its weapons testing processes.",

Matt Zenitz of 247Sports reports that USC’s D’Anton Lynn is *the* target for Penn State’s incumbent defensive coordinator job.\n\nUSC’s D’Anton Lynn is the target for the Penn State defensive coordinator job, sources tell @CBSSports.\n\nThe ex-Penn State DB has improved SC from 121st nationally in scoring defense two years ago to now allowing 12 fewer points per game. Before USC, led a top 15 defense at UCLA. pic.twitter.com/vkLnzqvodx\n\n— Matt Zenitz (@mzenitz) December 18, 2025\n\nA Penn State player from 2008-2011, Lynn was an NFL assistant from 2014-2022, working his way up from being a seasonal intern with the New York Jets to the safeties coach for the Ravens. He made the move to the college game in 2023, serving as the defensive coordinator at UCLA for one season and at USC for the past two. In both cases, he took over horrendous units and improved them mightily right away. Below is where the Bruins and Trojans defenses ranked in SP+ before Lynn’s arrival and then during his tenure.\n\nBefore D’Anton Lynn: UCLA (2022) — 83rd\nDuring D’Anton Lynn: UCLA (2023 — 17th\n\nBefore D’Anton Lynn:USC (2023) — 105th\nDuring D’Anton Lynn: USC (2024) — 48th\nDuring D’Anton Lynn: USC (2025) — 35th\n\nAt Penn State, he wouldn’t be taking over a dreadful unit — the Nittany Lions, even in a down defensive season, finished 33rd in SP+. But there’s still the element of a lot of transition with NFL departures and potential transfer portal movement that bringing in someone like Lynn who gets improved results right away would be an awesome fit.\n\nSo the guy is good. Really good. And it’d be quite the hire for Matt Campbell to get him just 12 months after the last guy got turned down.\n\nD’Anton Lynn was asked last week why he stayed on as USC’s DC after Penn State, his alma mater, pursued him. \n\nLynn: “I just couldn’t imagine myself coaching anybody else.”\n\n“The people we have here, it was just too tough to leave.”\n\n— Ryan Kartje (@RyanKartje) May 5, 2025\n\nWe’ll see where this goes. It’s a good sign to get a tweet like that from Zenitz, but until there’s a “are finalizing a deal” tweet, this one remains up in the air.",

    "description": "Jarred Vanderbilt sparked the Lakers' defensive effort in the win over Phoenix on Sunday, but they'll need their stars to contribute as well against Utah.",
    "fullText": "They saw how “contagious” it was when playing defense at a high level against the Suns and how Jarred Vanderbilt lit the fuse to ignite things for the Lakers in their last victory over Phoenix.\n\nAnd for the Lakers to maintain that defensive mindset, stars Luka Doncic and LeBron James also have to be committed to that end of the court.\n\nThat was the message from Lakers coach JJ Redick to Doncic and James.\n\n\"Yeah, it was good,\" Doncic said. \"We talked about a lot, not just that, but he was right. You got to get a little big more, especially from the star players. So that's on us. That's on me. And we just got to give more, especially at the start of the game. We got to start the game better. But I think in Phoenix, we did a pretty good job. The plan was focused on ourselves and [our] defensive mentality, so I think we did a pretty good job.\"\n\nThe Lakers will be tested again on defense by the Utah Jazz Thursday night in Salt Lake City.\n\nThe Jazz have a developing star in Lauri Markkanen, a difficult matchup at 7-foot-1 who is ninth in the NBA in scoring at 27.8 points per game, and a young talent in guard Keyonte George, who is averaging 23.5 points and 6.8 assists.\n\nUtah is fourth in the league in pace (102.98), ninth in scoring (119.0), second in assists (29.8). The Jazz are fifth in rebounds (45.7), eighth in offensive rebounds (12.6), and 12th in field-goal percentage.\n\n\"The way we play, we got to approach every game the same,\" Doncic said. \"In the NBA, every team is dangerous, so at some point somebody can go for 40. They have Markkanen, and then George. They can go for 40 on any night. So we just got to work on ourselves and approach the game, make everything the same.\"\n\nThe all-out energy and effort by Vanderbilt off the bench was the catalyst for the Lakers against the Suns.\n\nIn his 15 minutes of action, he had seven ponits, seven rebounds, two steals and one blocked shot.\n\nVanderbilt had played only three minutes and eight seconds over a 10-game stretch prior to that point.\n\n“Vando's minutes were huge,” Gabe Vincent said. “He came in and does what we all know he's very capable of doing and being disruptive on the defensive end, crashing the glass, getting extra possessions for us, all of which we desperately needed. You know what I mean? So his spark off the bench was huge for us.\"\n\nNow it’s about sustaining that defensive intensity, the Lakers say. And about playing with that physicality, the Lakers say.\n\n“Yeah, when you guys asked me this the last time, it’s effort,” Jake LaRavia said. “If we just go out there and we give that kind of effort every night…We got a lot of guys on the team. Some guys might not be having it and, like you said about that contagious word, that really helps out. (Marcus) Smart does it sometimes. Vando does it sometimes. I would say I do it just being a contagious type of person to help lead the team and just being extra physical.”\n\nThe Lakers are ranked near the bottom of the league in some defensive categories, which means there remains room for improvement.\n\nThey are ranked 17th in the league in points allowed (116.7), 24th in field-goal percentage (48.1%) allowed and 28th in three-point shooting (38.1%) allowed.\n\n“You just got to go out there and do it,” LaRavia said. “It’s not anything a coach can say. It’s not anything a player can tell another player. Yeah, it’s like the individual player’s job to go out there and give effort on defense and that’s contagious. It just goes around.”\n\nLakers center Deandre Ayton on Wednesday was named by the NBA and the National Basketball Players Assn. as the winner of the Bob Lanier Community Assist Award for November. Ayton was recognized for his philanthropic work across the Bahamas, which is his home country, Jamaica and Los Angeles through the Ayton Family Foundation.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "MIAMI, Fla. — Thursday, Cardinal Newman (West Palm Beach) pulled off one of the biggest upsets of the 2025 FHSAA state championships. The Crusaders took down four-time defending state champions Chaminade-Madonna (Hollywood) in a 17-14 victory.\n\nThe leader of the Newman defense was three-star LB Adam Balogoun-Ali, who ended his high school career in the best possible way.\n\n“There’s no better way to end it,” Balogoun-Ali said after the win. “It’s not even a bittersweet feeling—just pure joy. I love my guys. I’m so glad we could get this done.”\n\nChaminade was the favorite going into the game, but Newman proved that any team can win on any given day.\n\n“It’s just a jersey. It’s just a name. They’re not the same team that they were. We knew if we came in and punched them in the mouth, we could win this game, and that’s what happened.”\n\nThe Benjamin School transfer feels he’s grown exponentially in his senior year at Newman and credits head coach Jack Daniels with instilling a culture that laid the foundation for the school’s first state championship.\n\n“This is a more complicated defense. I would say the biggest thing I learned was how to take in all the info really fast, especially when [offenses] are going quickly, as Chaminade did. I think learning the [college] playbook will be much easier now that I’ve come to Newman this year.\n\n“Coach Jack Daniels ‘ culture that he set at Cardinal Newman is superb. It’s unlike anything I’ve been a part of, and I’m really glad could learn from it.”\n\nAhead of the state title game, the Auburn signee received some motivational words from the newly formed Tiger staff.\n\n“The whole staff has been really supportive. They were telling me it’s just another game and to do me.”\n\nAuburn defensive coordinator DJ Durkin, who was instrumental in landing Balogoun-Ali’s signing, was retained by the program, much to the delight of the Tiger signee.\n\n“This is why I went to Auburn. I want to be coached by him. I really believe in what he does development-wise and scheme-wise. I think we are going to do great things over there at Auburn.”\n\nThe 6-foot-1, 210-pound backer is confident with his signing with Auburn and believes in what new head coach Alex Golesh is building on the Plains.\n\n“There was a lot of doubt about where people were going and all that, but personally, with me, I’m excited. I think it’s going to be a good time. With Coach Golesh as our new head coach, I think our offense will get going a lot, and our defense is already elite. I think in one or two years we’ll be a top team.”",

    "description": "The Marine Air Defense Integration System, or MADIS, is in full production after trainings, live-fire exercises, and upgrades.",
    "fullText": "The Marine Corps has a new air defense system built to transform light vehicles into mobile weapons for shooting down drones and other aircraft.\n\nThe technology is intended to equip Marines with a new way to deal with drones and other aerial threats, the service announced this week. As the war in Ukraine has shown, the ability to counter these types of threats is critical in modern conflict.\n\nThe new Marine Air Defense Integration System, or MADIS, entered full-rate production earlier this fall after training and live-fire exercises. Placed on top of a pair of Joint Light Tactical Vehicles, MADIS converts the vehicles into a single short-ranged ground-based air defense system.\n\nThe vehicles work together, with one focused on countering drones and the other geared toward helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. MADIS uses Stinger missiles and a 30mm cannon for those targets, and it also comes with radars and electronic warfare systems. Marines can also use MADIS while on the move, giving the service a mobile air defense option.\n\nIt's a capability boost over the service's Man-Portable Air Defense System, or MANPAD, which Marines would've had to equip themselves and leave vehicles to use. MADIS is also capable of being upgraded over time, depending on what types of threats Marines are facing and what weapons they need for specific missions.\n\nMADIS, developed by the Norwegian firm Kongsberg Defense & Aerospace, has undergone several iterations since its initial prototype. The Marine Corps said its full-rate production version has sensors, algorithms, and mobility that allow Marines to locate, target, and destroy threats faster and better than before. Its first live-fire exercise took place during joint US-Philippine military training earlier this year.\n\nMarine Corps officials have said MADIS fills a gap in their air defense arsenal and is unique because it can complete the entire kill chain. Marines can use it to find and identify targets and then take them out rather than relying on several systems to do the same.\n\nMADIS also addresses Marine Corps concerns around how to defeat small uncrewed aerial systems in a potential future war.\n\nSince MADIS is mobile, it gives Marines a new way to defend forward-deployed forces — especially in a potential future fight against a sophisticated adversary like China.\n\nAs the Marine Corps reshapes its force for operations across the first island chain, from Japan to Taiwan to the Philippines, it needs systems that can move quickly and deliver more firepower against a wide range of aerial threats.",

    "description": "The Defense Department wants troops to have new weapons quickly. But testing processes don't include the best ways to do that, a new report documents.",
    "fullText": "The Pentagon wants to get troops new weapons faster, but its testing isn't following best practices, according to a new government watchdog report.\n\nCurrent policies have often focused on looking for problems after weapons are already developed, slowing down the process. Policy changes, the report concluded, would ultimately help the Department of Defense achieve the speed and modernization it is looking for.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office said the Pentagon needed to get testers involved early on, conduct iterative testing to find problems quickly and results in gradual changes, use digital twins to mirror actual physical systems, and seek regular user feedback.\n\nThese are key principles followed by companies for product development and they are applicable to the US military as it seeks to update its policies for faster, better weapons. Currently, GAO reporting indicates, the DoD implementation appears haphazard and sloppy.\n\nFor example, the development of the Air Force's new pilot training aircraft, the T-7A Red Hawk, didn't include allowing testers to access test data in a timely manner, and the contract didn't require a complete digital system model of system. And upgrades for the F-22 Raptor haven't considered how user feedback could be incorporated into an iterative testing process.\n\nWithout revising these development and design policies, \"the Air Force is missing opportunities to ensure that testing proceeds expeditiously and that the systems under test are responsive and relevant to warfighter needs,\" the GAO said.\n\nIn the Army, the new MV-75 Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft, which will eventually replace the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter, hasn't followed an iterative design approach. That could've resulted in tailoring testing to different changes in the aircraft's development, which could've gotten the system to pilots quicker, the watchdog office determined.\n\nAnd then the Navy, the GAO report said, only followed an iterative design process on its Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers for cybersecurity and didn't have a digital twin.\n\nReviews of the Department of Defense policies ultimately led the GAO to issue 13 recommendations, including that officials revise how they evaluate weapons and align their plans with better practices. The GAO said the Pentagon fully agreed with seven of those, partially agreed with five, and didn't concur with one.\n\nThe Pentagon did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nBroadly, the defense department faces a choice, the report concluded. \"On the one hand, it could continue to treat test and evaluation as a means of identifying deficiencies in weapon systems already developed and, often, already produced,\" it said. That wouldn't require any changes to the status quo but wouldn't help the Pentagon get weapons to troops faster.\n\n\"On the other hand, DoD has an opportunity to embrace test and evaluation as a core foundation of every weapon systems acquisition program,\" the GAO report added, which would be a significant change in the short term but position the department to \"ensure that warfighter needs are consistently understood, prioritized, and met\" in the long term.\n\nHow the Pentagon builds weapons is undergoing a shift as department leadership under the Trump administration seeks to speed up the process and get new technologies to troops quickly. Last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a memo directing the department to modernize its testing, reduce test oversight, and streamline requirements.\n\n\"Speed to capability delivery is now our organizing principle: the decisive factor in maintaining deterrence and warfighting advantage,\" Hegseth wrote.\n\nEarlier this year, Hegseth gutted the Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, which independently supervises the performance of weapons before they're given to US military personnel, decreasing the number of programs it oversees.\n\nHegseth said the cuts reduced bureaucracy and allowed for more rapid deployment of new weapons. Oversight experts, however, raised concerns that the cuts to DOT&E could put troops in danger and mean problems aren't identified before they hit the field.",

    "fullText": "Senate Republicans are growing increasingly uneasy with the Pentagon’s investigation into Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced his office is escalating its probe into him.\n\nThe Defense Department announced Monday the review of Kelly has risen to an “official Command Investigation,” intensifying the feud between the two sides over Kelly’s role in a video he and other congressional Democrats made to remind service members of their duty to disobey illegal orders.\n\nThe news has also given a number of Republicans pause as they question whether this is a prudent decision by the Pentagon against one of their colleagues.\n\n“I think it’s a terrible idea,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said.\n\nPaul was one of five Senate GOP members who expressed reservations about the Hegseth-led investigation into Kelly, a retired Navy captain.\n\nKelly has been under fire by the administration for nearly a month after he, Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) and Democratic Reps. Jason Crow (Colo.), Chris Deluzio (Pa.), Maggie Goodlander (N.H.) and Chrissy Houlahan (Pa.) appeared in the video that set off the series of comments.\n\nTrump also called for the execution of the half-dozen lawmakers — a remark he walked back.\n\nDays after the Democrats released the joint video, the Defense Department said it received “serious allegations of misconduct” against Kelly and that it kicked off a “thorough review” of the allegations. Hegseth ordered the Navy to finish the review and submit it to the Defense Department by Dec. 10.\n\nThe Navy submitted the report on potential punishments against Kelly to the department’s Office of General Counsel last week. The content and the scope of the report are unclear.\n\nWhat isn’t being walked back is the probe, which some Senate Republicans believe likely does not have merit.\n\n“I’m not,” Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said when asked whether she is comfortable with the expansion of the probe. “He is protected by the speech and debate clause.”\n\nHegseth appeared Tuesday on Capitol Hill alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio to brief lawmakers on the administration’s targeting of boats near Venezuela. Hegseth and Kelly got into a “long back-and-forth” during the briefing, according to Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.).\n\nAccording to one Senate Republican, the spat started with a reasonable question on Kelly’s end but eventually turned into a protracted discussion with GOP members complaining he was “filibustering” during a classified briefing when other attendees had questions.\n\nKelly said Hegseth brought up “talking points” about the video when he was asking the Pentagon chief about the strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.\n\n“I think, with regards to me, [Hegseth] kind of walked in there with a little speech that he wanted to give,” Kelly said after the briefing, adding, “I’m not going to waste my colleagues’ time with something that is specific to me.”\n\nKelly told reporters following the briefing the Pentagon still has not reached out to him about the investigation and argued the department is targeting him “for something I said that was lawful.”\n\n“This is all a bunch of bulls‑‑‑, and the reason why, I think, is because this is just about sending a message to retired service members, active duty service members, government employees: Do not speak out against this president, or there will be consequences,” he said.\n\nPaul Fishman, Kelly’s lawyer, warned that action by the Pentagon against the Democrat “would be unconstitutional and an extraordinary abuse of power.”\n\n“If the executive branch were to move forward in any forum — criminal, disciplinary, or administrative — we will take all appropriate legal action on Senator Kelly’s behalf to halt the Administration’s unprecedented and dangerous overreach,” Fishman wrote.\n\nWhen reached for comment, the Pentagon said it did not have further remarks and referred The Hill to Monday’s statement.\n\nSenate GOP members are concerned Hegseth’s actions are setting a precedent that could boomerang on Republicans.\n\n“These members are going to be here after this administration’s gone. We’re creating a precedent that everybody should expect could be used against them,” one GOP senator told The Hill.\n\n“Yeah — he made a video,” they continued. “But I don’t think it rises to the level that they’re trying to make it. It really seems to me like vindictive prosecutions, and that’s a bad message to send to the American people.”\n\nKelly is the only one of the six lawmakers who falls under the Defense Department’s purview. Four of the others are former military members but are not retired like Kelly is. Slotkin is an ex-CIA official.\n\nEven some Republicans who are more ardent supporters of the president indicated they have questions about whether the investigation is warranted.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters he didn’t believe taking part in the video was “very wise” on Kelly’s part.\n\n“But I don’t know if it broke any laws,” he added.\n\nSen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), a retired Marine, similarly criticized Kelly’s participation. Nevertheless, he cautioned he believes the investigation is not a “good use of the Pentagon’s time.”\n\n“While Senator Sullivan believes the message in the video was irresponsible and politically driven, he does not believe it is a good use of the Pentagon’s time to investigate Senator Kelly — who served honorably in the Navy — under the UCMJ [Uniform Code of Military Justice], particularly given that the Constitution’s Speech or Debate Clause would likely take precedence over any UCMJ provision,” a spokesperson for Sullivan said in a statement.\n\n“Such an investigation has the potential to turn into a major distraction for our military,” they continued. “After four years of Biden’s woke military, the Department of War needs to stay laser focused on lethality and war fighting.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is planning an executive order that would limit dividends, buybacks and executive pay for defense contractors whose projects are over-budget and delayed, according to three ​sources briefed on the order.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and the Pentagon have been complaining about the expensive, slow-moving and entrenched ‌nature of the defense industry, promising dramatic changes that would make the production of war equipment more nimble.\n\nIndustry groups have been on high alert about the ‌closely-held proposal, which is tied to a Treasury Department initiative, two of the sources said.\n\nA White House official said: \"Until officially announced by the White House, discussion about potential executive orders is purely speculation.\"\n\nShares ⁠of Lockheed fell 1.6% and Northrop Grumman sank ‌2% in after-hours trading after some aspects of the news were first reported by online political news service Punchbowl.\n\nDEFENSE FIRMS OFTEN BUY BACK SHARES\n\nShare buybacks are common among defense firms, and several pay a ‍dividend. Lockheed in October, for example, raised its dividend for the 23rd year in a row, to $3.45 per share. At the same time, it authorized the purchase of up to $2 billion of its shares, raising the total amount promised for repurchases to $9.1 billion.\n\nLockheed's F-35 fighter jet, one of ​the most expensive U.S. defense programs, has been plagued by rising costs and delays. Many big defense programs take much longer ‌to deliver a product than initially promised and at a far higher price.\n\nThe $140 billion Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile program that will replace aging Minuteman III missiles, designed and managed by Northrop Grumman, will be years behind schedule and 81% over budget, the U.S. military said last year.\n\nThe biggest defense firms, including Lockheed, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the executive order.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth unveiled sweeping changes in November to how the Pentagon purchases weapons, ⁠allowing the military to more rapidly acquire technology amid growing global threats, ​in accordance with an executive order signed by Trump in April.\n\nThat restructuring will ​have direct authority over major weapons programs to eliminate bureaucracy.",

    "fullText": "Professor Gene Sharp of Southeastern Massachusetts University has given several years of study to the possibilities of deterrence and resistance by civilians as a conceivable alternative, or partial alternative, to the traditional, purely military concepts of national defense that have so long prevailed and continue to prevail in European countries. He has restricted the range of applicability of his researches and reflections to Europe, and has directed them, within those limits, primarily to the neutral countries such as Austria and Finland. But his study is intended to apply, at least hypothetically, to such other countries, now members of one or the other of the great nuclear alliances, as might in some distant future succeed in detaching themselves from the alliance in question and thus find themselves compelled to devise an independent defense policy that makes sense with regard to the military and political realities of the present day. The question addressed in this book is essentially this: Where is the peace-loving, nonaggressive, and nonaligned country to find the maximum security against outside interference and domination in a world where war itself, and therefore the traditional preparations for war, have lost so much of their rationale as instruments of national policy?\n\nThe answer in the NATO establishment (and perhaps also, although with diminished conviction and enthusiasm, in the Soviet one, too) would be: in the nuclear deterrent, of course. Either, one would say, you have your own nuclear arsenal, or you ally yourself with someone else who has one.\n\nMr. Sharp challenges (quite correctly in the opinion of this reviewer) the validity of this supposed alternative. Not only is the nuclear deterrent by its very nature dangerously unstable but it is not really a means of defense. In the concept of nuclear deterrence, Mr. Sharp notes, “the capacity to defend in order to deter has been replaced by the capability to destroy massively without the ability to defend.” Beyond this there is, for any country wishing to go the nuclear road, the necessity of choosing between the development of a nuclear arsenal of one’s own, at vast expense and in defiance of the international effort to restrict proliferation, and the acceptance of an alliance with some existing nuclear power—a relationship bound, as experience has shown, to raise the unanswerable question about whose interests, those of the protector or those of the nominally protected, are eventually to prevail in a moment of crisis so brief as to be responsive only to the impulses of the computer.\n\nFinally, as Mr. Sharp also points out, to create a nuclear arsenal or to accept someone else’s missiles on one’s own territory is to increase immensely, from a point of near zero to a very high level, the danger that in any sort of a nuclear conflict one’s own country will become a likely target. Mr. Sharp could even have strengthened his case, in this respect, by pointing out that the Soviet leaders have repeatedly and specifically affirmed that they would never use nuclear weapons against any country that did not itself deploy them or permit them to be deployed on its own territory—an assurance that deserves greater credence than it has generally received, not only because there would be no reason to put out such a statement exclusively to deceive, but also because, given the general irrationality of the nuclear weapon, that policy in question makes perfectly good sense.\n\nThus for a nonnuclear country determined to pursue an independent policy but required to live under the shadow of the nuclear competition of the two super-powers, the nuclear option is not a hopeful one. But neither, for that matter, is an exclusive reliance on the traditional concepts of defense with “conventional” weapons. In an age of long-range striking power by aircraft, by missiles, even by long-range artillery, the idea of defense at the frontier has lost its reality. Beyond that, such is now the destructive power of even nonnuclear weapons that a war fought with them, particularly a defensive war presumably conducted largely on one’s own territory, promises nothing but a degree of devastation that makes a mockery of the very idea of military victory. Here we simply get back to the fact that war, generally, as among the industrially advanced and technologically sophisticated countries, can no longer serve any useful purpose—not even that of a defense.\n\nIt did not, actually, take the post–World War II advances in weapons technology to establish this fact. It is inescapably clear that in the two great European wars of this century there were, in reality, no victors. These were, in effect, simply senseless orgies of destruction. The damages they inflicted, on the nominal victor and the defeated alike, were far greater and more insidious than people were even aware of at the time, reaching as they did into the spiritual and genetic as well as the purely military and physical realms. It is idle for the independent European country of this day to suppose that by entering into a new and even more horrible round of such carnage it could protect anything worth protecting.\n\nThese two supposed alternatives for an independent defense on the part of the unaligned Continental country are therefore, when looked at carefully, no alternatives at all. It is not surprising, in these circumstances, that people’s minds should turn to the question whether there might not be some means of defense that would at least hold out hope of avoiding the sheer physical disasters that both of these supposed alternatives invite. It is this necessity that has led to Professor Sharp’s inquiry into the possibilities and limitations of civilian-based defense; and it would be unfair to judge it in any way other than in relation to the unpromising nature of these two, and only, visible alternatives. It is worth bearing in mind, as one reads his book, that however one assesses the possibilities of civilian-based defense, the nature of the available alternatives is such that it would not take much to be preferable to them.\n\nMr. Sharp’s study addresses itself, as its subtitle (The Potential of Civilian-based Deterrence and Defence) implies, both to deterrence and to resistance if deterrence fails. The two are of course closely connected; but each requires separate treatment, and receives it.\n\nDeterrence, in this instance, is of particular importance. For the study starts, as so much conventional military thinking fails to do, from the assumption that the presumptive attacker is motivated not just by a blind urge to destroy for destruction’s sake but rather by a wholly rational desire to gain domination over the political life of the victim country and to use that domination to his own advantage. And here, of course, is where the reactions of the civilian population—its will to resist and the preparation it has been given for doing so—come in. To deny this is to fly in the face of the historical evidence. For if we consider the failure of other powers to attack Switzerland during the two world wars, the failure of the Soviet Union to occupy Finland in the wake of their conflicts during World War II, and the similar abstention by Moscow from attacking Yugoslavia after that country’s break with the Soviet Union in 1948, we can see that calculations relating to the respective country’s presumptive powers of internal resistance, while certainly not the only considerations that played a part, occupied a prominent place among those that determined the final decision.\n\nThe successful imposition of foreign domination over a given country requires the ability of the dominating power to find, from among the population of that country, a faction either so inspired ideologically or so successfully cowed as to serve as a puppet government. It then requires that this faction should have the capacity to recruit the requisite indigenous bureaucracy, and to compel the population to accept and respect its authority. But whether these conditions can or cannot be met is something that will be importantly affected by the extent and effectiveness of the training, indoctrination, and general preparation for resistance that the population has received in advance of the event. This, in turn, is something the potential aggressor is likely to have a fair idea of before he takes the decision whether or not to attack; and his decision is bound to be affected by his assessment of its importance.\n\nAs for resistance itself if deterrence fails, there are a great many possible forms of this (Mr. Sharp has himself identified nearly two hundred of them). Some of these may be overt and largely spontaneous; others require the most highly centralized leadership, training, and direction. Some are designed to have military effect; others are directed solely to civilian administration. Some require mass participation; others can be conducted only conspiratorially, by carefully selected and highly trained individuals. The mix to be chosen in any given instance must depend on the nature of the country in question and the peculiarities of the prevailing situation. To select among these, and to conduct careful advance planning and preparation for their implementation, is a function that lies at the heart of civilian-based defense as Mr. Sharp sees it; and it is precisely in this respect that his reflections are most importantly innovative.\n\nFor seldom, if ever, in the contests of the past, has there been any such thing as this careful advance preparation. The resistance movements that made themselves felt during the Second World War were almost without exception ones that had to be improvised under conditions of extreme danger and difficulty—under the eyes and guns, that is, of the occupier. There can be no doubt that had they had the sort of advance preparation this study envisages, their effectiveness would have been increased several times over. Lines of command would have been known; effective channels of communication would have existed; there would have been adequate caches of weapons and supplies; ordinary citizens would have had guidance and instruction as to how to behave; given types of action would have been rehearsed and prepared.\n\nSkeptics may point to the long endurance of the Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe as evidence of the hopelessness of civilian resistance to domination by a strong outside power. But again, what they will be citing as an example is not at all what Mr. Sharp has in mind. There was, in those instances, no possibility whatsoever for advance preparation—quite the contrary. What the Soviet authorities found before them, as their armies overran this great region, was a territory where all semblance of real indigenous authority had already been swept away by the preceding Nazi-German occupation. It is often forgotten that it was not the Russians but the Nazis who destroyed the prewar status quo in that part of the world, and with it all social and political stability. What the Russians found there was in fact a territory ideally prepared to receive just the sort of domination they were desirous of establishing—a situation, in short, just the opposite of the one Mr. Sharp has in mind when he examines the possibilities of a resistance well prepared in advance by an indigenous government enjoying the confidence of the people. For this concept, there are, in fact, few examples. It is a modern concept, addressed to the unprecedented conditions of this modern age.\n\nI am not in total agreement with all of Mr. Sharp’s argument. There are places where the emphasis, in my view, could have been usefully shifted. I would have placed more weight on highly centralized, clandestine direction, less on spontaneous mass action. I am not sure that the nature of civilian defense planning should be so widely publicized as the author of the book would seem to envisage. I am less sanguine than he is about the possibilities for demoralizing the armed forces of an intruder. But these are minor differences, particularly if we take into account the limitations Mr. Sharp has placed on his own conclusions.\n\nThere is, of course, in this endangered world, no such thing as absolute defense for anyone; and Mr. Sharp advances no claim that a civilian-based system would provide this. He does not even claim that civilian-based defense could usefully constitute the only component of an adequate defense policy. He recognizes that it might have to be combined, at one stage or another, with the actions of certain types of regular military forces. He does not even depict his own conclusions as definitive. His plea is only that civilian-based defense has a legitimate place among the options open to the sort of country he is talking about; that this place is plainly larger than has been generally supposed; and that its possibilities ought to be more carefully studied and considered than they have been in the past. His primary purpose in writing the book was, he says, “to make civilian-based deterrence and defense a thinkable policy which is recognized as meriting further research, policy studies, and an evaluation.” And for this, he makes a reasonably good case.\n\nBut he must not expect, just for this reason, that the effort to win understanding for his views will be easy going. It goes against the grain of all established strategic thinking. The professional military establishments will brush it off with incredulity, if not with contempt. It will arouse in many circles the same skepticism, and perhaps the same derision, that this reviewer brought down upon himself when he had the temerity to advance somewhat similar ideas in a widely publicized radio lecture delivered over the facilities of the BBC many years ago.\n\nBut the view advanced in this book deserves consideration, if only because of the bankruptcy of all the visible alternatives to it. It might just be that in a world where the devices of long-range military destruction have proliferated beyond all reason, the greatest security any country can hope to have, imperfect as it is, will be found to lie primarily in its confidence in itself, in its readiness to leave other people alone and to go its own way, it its willingness to accept the sort of social discipline that a civilian-based defense implies—in a stance, in other words, that offers minimal incentive to foreign military intrusion but promises to make things difficult, painful, and unprofitable for any power that decides, nevertheless, to intrude. Such principles may not be everywhere applicable. Nowhere may they be the complete answer to the problems at hand. But beggars, in this world of destructive power unlimited, cannot always be choosers. And Mr. Sharp’s approach, certainly more humane and in a small way more hopeful than many others, deserves at least to be given a hearing.\n\nTo see things in this way will require, however, a rather basic change in the view hundreds of millions of people have been taught to take of the sources of national security and of the means by which it may be usefully promoted. The new view would be one that looks primarily inward—to the quality of the respective society, to the character of its institutions, to its social discipline and civic morale, rather than outward to the effectiveness of its armed forces—for the true sources of its strength and its security. It suggests, in Mr. Sharp’s words, “the direct defense of society as such—its principles, free institutions, and liberties—rather than a futile attempt to defend territory as an indirect means to defend the society.” It raises, in fact, the question whether any society can be stronger in relation to others than it is to itself.\n\nWhat is implied here is no less than a change in political philosophy. For it taps, as Mr. Sharp says in his final passages, “a crucial insight into the nature of power”—namely, that\n\nall political power is rooted in and continually dependent upon the co-operation and obedience of the subjects and institutions of the society…. It is indeed possible for whole societies to apply that insight…against internal and foreign aggressors, and to triumph…. With effort, risks, and costs, it is possible for Europeans—and all peoples—to make themselves politically indigestible to would-be tyrants. The process has already begun.\n\nPerhaps those words overstate the case; but if so, not greatly. One ends the reading of the book wondering whether, if this change in political philosophy were to take place, it might not have wider effects than just those that relate to the concepts of national security—whether many other things might not also change, and, in the main, usefully so.\n\nGeorge F. Kennan (1904–2005) was an American diplomat, political scientist and historian. He is best known for his role in shaping US foreign policy during the Cold War and, in particular, for the doctrine of containment. Kennan was Professor Emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton and served as Ambassador to the USSR in 1952 and as Ambassador to Yugoslavia from 1961 to 1963.
