    "description": "Seattle's level of domination has set the bar incredibly high for whoever wins the frozen showdown between the Chicago Bears and Los Angeles Rams.",
    "fullText": "Seattle laid its claim for the NFL throne in the exact way it did during its dominant run toward the NFC’s No. 1 seed: by ferociously pummeling their opponent without mercy.\n\nThe Seahawks’ offense had a productive, albeit somewhat ugly game Saturday night against the San Francisco 49ers, but Seattle’s defense (and special teams!) stole the show in this 41-6 divisional round wipeout. Now Seattle is a game away from getting back to the Super Bowl for the first time in over a decade.\n\nIt’s a playoff position star defender DeMarcus Lawrence, who had a strip sack of Brock Purdy late in the second half, hasn’t seen in his career after spending 11 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys. His prophetic words from last March about leaving Dallas for Seattle in free agency made a comeback on social media after the Seahawks’ emphatic win. And they’re bound to have some staying power this coming week as the Seahawks prepare for the NFC title game. But what else stuck out for Lawrence that symbolized this tenacious defense was the new necklace he sported postgame with the initials: MOB.\n\nNew “MOB” necklace for DeMarcus Lawrence looks like it wasn’t free pic.twitter.com/sYP7WASZPE\n\n— Mike Sando (@SandoNFL) January 18, 2026\n\n“Yeah, brand new MOB necklace, man,” Lawrence said. “You know, just letting the world know how we coming, you know.”\n\nIn a league where offenses and quarterbacks are the stars of the show, Seattle has built a defense that’s just as compelling as the biggest, flashiest arms in the NFL and they showed that they’re absolutely good enough to ride to a title.\n\nSeattle didn't even let the 49ers get into the game, doing the same thing it did during the Week 18 regular-season finale when it stifled the 49ers’ running game, which subsequently forced Brock Purdy to be a dropback passer and throw into the teeth of an immovable defense. This weekend, the Seahawks held the 49ers to 28 yards on 11 designed runs in the first half, and again forced the 49ers to play a style of football they don’t want to play.\n\nThe Seahawks forced their second turnover on downs of the night to open the third quarter, the offense rewarded the defense with a field goal and the 21-point deficit was too much against Seattle’s marauding defense.\n\nThis is the kind of performance that No. 1 seeds should have against weaker opponents in their conference. Not that the 49ers are a bad team, they’re just an absurdly injured one. But this level of domination has set the bar incredibly high for whoever wins the frozen showdown between the Chicago Bears and Los Angeles Rams. In a season when head coach Kyle Shanahan had all the answers as the 49ers’ lineups shifted and became more depleted, the Seahawks were all over everything he tried to throw out. Not only are they talented, they’re incredibly well-orchestrated with second-year head coach Mike Macdonald pulling all the strings on defense.\n\nThe 49ers didn’t even reach the red zone in this game and this was an offense that ranked top-three in most standard and advanced metrics over the back half of the season. It’s not like the Seahawks have been padding their stats against the worst teams that the league has to offer. This status is earned through trial. The only offense to put up over 20 points on Seattle over the final nine weeks of the season has been the Rams (the Titans scored 24 but they had a 90-yard punt return touchdown). They’ve given up 75 points since Week 13 with 37 of those points, legitimately half, coming against the Rams.\n\nTeams need to be as dialed in, talented and well-coached as the Rams to really score against this defense. The run the Seahawks are on will go down in the record books as an all-time finish if they can maintain this level of defensive dominance against one of two of the better offenses in the NFL. In the Rams’ case, they’re probably just the flat-out best offense period this season.\n\nThat creates a potentially fascinating third matchup between the Seahawks and their division rival Rams, but L.A. still has to get there first. Caleb Williams and the Bears are no pushover at this point, but when Seattle stuffs Shanahan and the 49ers in a locker for the second time in three weeks, it's hard not to feel like this is the current favorite for the Super Bowl. Seattle’s defense is really that good and it has one of the elite special teams units in the entire league, as shown by Rashid Shaheed’s 95-yard opening kickoff return for a touchdown.\n\nThe health of the Bears or Rams will likely create a tougher test than what the 49ers were able to muster, but this defense is playing as well as a unit possibly can in the modern NFL and the Seahawks seem to be getting better each week. No matter who shows up to face the Seahawks next Sunday, the only thing louder than Lumen Field will be the boom this defense brings seemingly every single play.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — From toppling Venezuela's leader to ordering mass deportations, from turning once independent government entities into rubber stamps to demolishing the East Wing for a White House ballroom, President Donald Trump spent his first year back in office trampling political norms and testing institutional checks and balances.\n\nSome of his ideas that once seemed implausible, if not outright fanciful, are now reality. But there are other things that Trump could not deliver on.\n\n“I’ve kept all my promises and much more,” Trump insisted during a speech this week in Detroit.\n\nWith his administration nearing the one-year mark, here's a look at where some of his most jaw-dropping promises stand:\n\nIn progress: A new Qatari Air Force One\n\nU.S. defense officials in May accepted a luxury Boeing 747 jet from Qatar for Trump to eventually use as Air Force One, brushing aside ethical and legal questions and even anti-bribery constitutional provisions. The aircraft is being retrofitted in Texas to meet U.S. security and communications standards that are likely to cost about $400 million, the Air Force says. Outside experts estimate costs could approach $1 billion. Despite Trump's boasts that the work would be done in six months, completion may not actually occur until after he leaves office in January 2029.\n\nWhat's in progress: Annexing Greenland\n\nAfter the U.S. military's removal of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, Trump renewed his calls to take over the semiautonomous Danish territory, insisting the United States will “have” Greenland “one way or another.” The president also tapped Gov. Jeff Landry, R-La., as the special U.S. envoy to Greenland, with a nod to the 1803 Louisiana Purchase from France that doubled the size of the U.S. Denmark says it is not ceding the world's largest island and that any invasion could have geopolitical implications given that Denmark is a NATO ally.\n\nTrump has tried to denigrate his predecessor, Joe Biden, by accusing the Democrat of overreliance on the autopen to sign presidential pardons, legislation and other key documents, despite the fact that Trump and other presidents have also used the tool. In October, a GOP-controlled House committee released a report alleging misuse of the autopen by the Biden administration. Trump's Department of Justice is investigating.\n\nThe president has said he wants to reopen an “expanded and rebuilt” Alcatraz, the notorious San Francisco Bay prison that has been closed for six-plus decades, to house immigration detainees. William K. Marshall III, the director of the Bureau of Prisons, toured the island in July. His agency announced that engineers and planners were developing design concepts, preliminary budgets and logistical models.\n\nTrump has posted on social media about extending traditional home mortgages repayments from 30 years to 50 years, suggesting that this could ease concerns about housing affordability. Economists say the switch would make it harder to build wealth through home ownership. Nonetheless, the White House has pledged to push the change. Officials have made little headway since, however, and Trump instead has looked to reduce mortgage rates by having the federal government buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds.\n\nTrump has frequently toyed with the idea of a third term, despite the Constitution stating that no one can be elected president “more than twice.” He acknowledged in October, “I would say that if you read it, it’s pretty clear I’m not allowed to run. It’s too bad.” White House chief of staff Susie Wiles also told Vanity Fair that Trump “knows he can’t run again.” Still, Trump mused this month, “I’m not allowed to run? I’m not sure,” and suggested there could be “a constitutional movement” to make that happen.\n\nWhat's faded away: Making Canada the 51st state\n\nDespite it being far-fetched, Trump has talked about making America's northern neighbor the “Great State of Canada” since before his second term started. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney assured Trump during a subsequent White House visit that his country “won’t be for sale, ever.” Carney suggested in June that Trump had lost interest. Trump has continued to bring up the idea, though, including during a September speech to military personnel in Virginia.\n\nTrump suggested in February that billionaire Elon Musk would be checking out Fort Knox in Kentucky to ensure that U.S. gold reserves were still there. The president even floated the notion of tagging along. Nothing came of that, however, and Musk has left the administration.\n\nSending thousands of migrants to Guantanamo\n\nThe president pledged to ship up to 30,000 of the “worst criminal aliens” to a U.S. Navy lockup in Cuba, and between February and June, about 500 immigrants were held there. But those numbers have since declined and sometimes reached zero. Housing migrants at Guantanamo is more expensive than in traditional detention centers, and doing so has drawn legal challenges.\n\nGaza Strip as a Mediterranean Sea resort\n\nTrump repeatedly suggested that the U.S. would take over war-torn Gaza and move out the Palestinians living there, and that U.S. developers could turn the area into a “Riviera of the Middle East,” after the war between Israel and Hamas. Gaza's reconstruction is a key question amid a Trump administration-brokered ceasefire, but Arab nations have rejected the idea of it being a vacation spot. Trump no longer mentions it.\n\nThe president says his tariffs could raise enough revenue for most Americans to get $2,000 payments. But he also has pledged to spend that same money on plugging deficits created by tax cuts, reducing the national debt, keeping a key nutrition program for low-income mothers and children funded during last year's government shutdown, aiding farmers and adding to defense spending for 2027. The U.S. collected about $289 billion in tariff revenue last year, which would be well short of what rebate checks would cost, even without the other promised earmarks. Trump also promised that slashing the size of federal government would give Americans rebate checks, but those never materialized.\n\nEliminating the federal income tax\n\nTrump has frequently said that steep import tariffs “will be enough to cut all of the income tax,” long suggesting that the U.S. was better off during the Gilded Age, when there was no income tax and federal revenue came largely from tariffs. “If you go back to the 1800s, 1887,” he said Friday, “We had money, so much money, we didn’t know what to do with it.” Lately, however, his administration has more often been promoting how much his tax and spending law might reduce 2026 tax bills for many Americans.\n\nTrump hates the dynamic kickoff, calling it a “demeaning” and “unromantic” affront to football's “pageantry.” By November, Trump was suggesting the NFL didn't “have the right to do that to the game” while acknowledging, “I don’t think they’ll change.”\n\nWhat's been accomplished: Bringing back the War Department\n\nTrump signed an executive order in September aiming to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War. It will take an act of Congress to make the change lawful.\n\nThe board of trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, stocked with Trump loyalists, voted in December to add Trump's name to Washington's premier performing arts venue, memorializing the 35th president. The move drew show cancellations and a lawsuit. The Kennedy Center is named by statute and would need Congress' approval for a legal change.\n\nReducing Chinese influence on the Panama Canal\n\nTrump suggested before his second term that the U.S. might retake control of the Panama Canal because Panama had failed to check Chinese influence over the waterway. His administration then pressured China to have the Hong Kong-based operator of ports at both ends of the canal sell those interests to a U.S. consortium, though that process faced delays. Panama withdrew from China's Belt and Road investment program in Latin America, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited Panama in April and agreed to bolster security coordination.\n\nThe president announced in December that his long-promised “ gold card ” was going on sale. It offers legal status, and an eventual pathway to U.S. citizenship, for individuals paying $1 million and corporations ponying up twice that per foreign-born employee, plus an upfront $15,000 fee to cover screening costs. The program is meant to replace EB-5 visas, which offered permanent U.S. residency in exchange for foreign investors spending a bit more than $1 million on a business that creates at least 10 full-time jobs for American workers.\n\nSince tearing down the East Wing, construction crews have worked into the night, hustling to finish the massive ballroom before Trump's term ends. The president initially said the structure, set to be bigger than the White House itself, would cost $200 million but he now says $400 million. He has promised that it will be paid for by himself and private donors. The White House has released only a partial list of who is actually contributing and has argued that parts of the project's plans are “ top secret.”\n\nMore to watch: Possible US military action in Colombia, Mexico and Iran\n\nFollowing the U.S. operation in Venezuela, Trump accused Colombian President Gustavo Petro of “making cocaine and selling it to the United States” and said U.S intervention in that country “sounds good to me.” After a friendly call with Petro, however, Trump suggested that “the situation of drugs and other disagreements” had been defused. Trump, though, also maintains that Mexico is “run” by drug cartels and says, “You have to do something with Mexico.” He's warned Iran that if that country starts “killing people like they have in the past” during a recent round of sweeping, anti-government protests, then “they are going to get hit very hard by the United States.” Killings have run into the thousands, but by Friday, Trump appeared to be backing off those threats.\n\nCuba collapsing with or without US intervention\n\nTrump has repeatedly noted Cuba's weakened position since the U.S. captured Maduro, whose country was a major ally of the communist-run island. Trump has said Cuba “only survives because of Venezuela” and is “ready to fall” without the U.S. intervening. Venezuela's economic and social chaos and Maduro's ouster have raised questions about Cuba's future. But Trump has also suggested Cuba “make a deal, BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE,” without saying what that means.\n\nTrump says he wants a Golden Dome missile defense program — a multilayered, $175 billion system that would put U.S. weapons in space for the first time — to be fully operational by January 2029. Defense officials say more likely all that will be achieved by then is some initial capability for the system. It is envisioned to include ground- and space-based capabilities that can detect and stop missiles at various stages of attack.\n\nTrump said he talked to Rob Manfred before Major League Baseball's commissioner reinstated Cincinnati Reds slugger Pete Rose in May. Rose died in 2024 but still faced a baseball ban over betting on the game, despite having a record 4,256 career hits. Trump now wants Rose in the Hall of Fame, but that's up to the Hall’s Classic Baseball Committee, which likely will not meet until at least December 2027.\n\nThe fourth installment of the cop buddy-comedy series starring Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan will be coming out after a reported request from Trump. Paramount, which is co-owned by David Ellison, son of Oracle co-founder and Trump megadonor Larry Ellison, is set to distribute the film. Semafor reported that Trump had asked Ellison to help revive the franchise. Warner Bros. released the first three “Rush Hour” films, but eschewed the fourth after earlier sexual misconduct allegations against its director, Brett Ratner. Ratner also made a documentary on first lady Melania Trump.",

    "description": "The game got away from the Packers defense in the second half because they couldn’t figure out a way to stop Bears rookie tight end Colston Loveland.",
    "fullText": "GREEN BAY – Each week during the NFL season, PackersNews reporter Pete Dougherty and Eric Baranczyk break down game film from the Green Bay Packers game, looking for significant developments.\n\nThe following is an excerpt from this week’s story. For the full story, click here.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers’ defense had a winning performance in keeping the Chicago Bears’ running game in check during their 31-27 wild-card playoff loss Jan. 10.\n\nChicago came into this game ranked No. 3 in the NFL in rushing yards per game and per carry but gained only 93 yards rushing and a measly 3.3-yard average in this game.\n\nBut the game got away from defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley in the second half because he couldn’t figure out a way to stop rookie tight end Colston Loveland.\n\nLoveland had only one catch in the first half but finished with eight receptions for 137 yards and a touchdown for the game. He kept getting open behind the Packers’ linebackers, who took relatively shallow drops even as Loveland started becoming a primary target.\n\nHafley presumably wanted to keep his linebackers closer to the line of scrimmage in case Caleb Williams escaped the pocket, which is when he’s most dangerous. Hafley also didn’t call a blitz-heavy game (12 total) to put pressure on Williams, which is a sign he didn’t think cornerbacks Keisean Nixon and Carrington Valentine would hold up with less help in coverage.\n\nThe other alternative would have been to mug up a linebacker on Loveland at the line of scrimmage to disrupt his routes, but Hafley did not try that either.\n\nThe alternatives aren’t great against Williams because he is so dangerous when he’s on the move. The Packers did a decent job keeping him in the pocket much of the night, and he was his usual hit-and-miss self from the pocket. He completed only half (24) of his 48 passes on the night.\n\nBut the Bears have a quality receiving corps with Rome Odunze, DJ Moore and rookie Luther Burden III, which also demands attention. Then when Loveland started gashing the Packers, Hafley had no answer.\n\nIt was surprising the Packers didn’t give Trevon Diggs some snaps to see if he could make a game-turning interception.\n\nThey claimed Diggs on waivers two weeks ago, and after playing him a half against Minnesota, it looked like they might have seen enough to rotate him or even start him at cornerback against the Bears. But raising that possibility during press conferences last week was apparently a ruse to force the Bears to waste some time preparing for him.\n\nDiggs has only two interceptions since an ACL injury in 2023, and by all accounts has not been the player he was. But he was a ballhawk who had 18 interceptions in 47 games before that. He played only one snap against the Bears.\n\nDiggs is under contract for next season, but there is zero chance the Packers will bring him back at $15.5 million in bonuses and salary. They might have brought him on just as insurance at the cornerback position in case they made a deep playoff run, though there’s also the chance they saw enough to like in practice the last two weeks to try to bring him back with a big pay cut.\n\nJonathan Ford didn’t do much to distinguish in his first game back with the Packers, at Minnesota in the regular-season finale. But he played much better in helping them hold running backs De’Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai to 81 yards rushing and a 3.9-yard average per carry.\n\nFord, who played 18 snaps, had issues getting knocked off the line of scrimmage against the Vikings despite his 338-pound frame. But he held the point of attack much better against the Bears.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers News: Packers defense gets burned by Bears rookie tight end | Film review",

    "description": "Venezuela relied on Russian air defense systems and Chinese radars, but its forces did not shoot down any US military aircraft.",
    "fullText": "The US expected \"significant resistance\" from Venezuela's air defense systems during the nighttime raid to capture the country's former president, Nicolás Maduro, a newly released memo reveals.\n\nThe heavily redacted memorandum from the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel sheds new light on the Trump administration's planning efforts ahead of the early January military operation, including what opposition US forces might face from Venezuela's military and what that meant for the helicopters carrying special operators into downtown Caracas to grab Maduro and his wife.\n\n\"It is expected that US forces will face significant resistance on the approach,\" T. Elliot Gaiser, an assistant attorney general, wrote in the December 23 memo that was made public this week. \"There are as many as 75 anti-aircraft battery sites along the approach route to Fort Tiuna,\" Gaiser cited planning information provided by the Department of Defense.\n\nFort Tiuna, or Fuerte Tiuna, is a major military installation in the capital city, Caracas, that hosts defense ministries, critical commands, official residences, and other strategic infrastructure, and it is where Maduro was believed to be during the raid. The US heavily bombed the base, with satellite imagery showing widespread destruction at the site in the aftermath.\n\nThe DOJ memo also noted that Maduro's wife, Cilia Flores, would likely be present at the base. It said that she is \"known to be more aggressive and combative\" than her husband.\n\nMore than 150 US warplanes participated in the American operation, named Operation Absolute Resolve, including fighter jets, bombers, and drones. Some of these aircraft carried out strikes against Venezuelan military targets, including surface-to-air missile systems, to clear a path for low-flying helicopters carrying the forces that apprehended Maduro and his wife.\n\nThe DOJ memo hinted at additional threats and noted that Venezuela possessed unspecified, due to the heavy redactions, \"weapons\" that \"are capable of downing the helicopters carrying\" the assault forces. It's possible this is a reference to the Russian Igla man-portable air defense systems, shoulder-launched missiles designed to hit low-altitude targets, but it's unclear.\n\nMaduro said prior to the raid that Venezuela possessed thousands of Igla launchers.\n\nVenezuela relied heavily on Russian-made systems for its air defense network — such as S-300 batteries, Buk systems, and S-125 Pechora launchers — and Chinese radars. These weapon systems are believed to have been older export variants, though still capable; however, reporting indicates that systems might have been offline or in storage at the time of the attack.\n\nThough there had long been questions about the readiness of Venezuela's air defense network, Pentagon planners still considered it necessary to neutralize it. \"Before the assault force arrives at Fort Tiuna,\" the memo said, aircraft \"will serve as an escort and clear emplaced anti-aircraft batteries as needed.\"\n\n\"Risks to the mission are significant. Success will depend on surprise,\" the DOJ memo, which reviews the legality of the US raid, warned at the time.\n\nVenezuela's air defenses did not shoot down any US military aircraft during the raid; Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said shortly after the mission ended that the systems had been quickly dismantled by American forces.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth later said it \"seems those Russian air defenses didn't quite work so well, did they?\"\n\nThe newly released DOJ memo, which details how the US could present this as a law enforcement operation rather than an act of war, wrote that \"in addition to the targets for pre-assault fire,\" the Department of Defense \"has identified three airfields that may be destroyed should it appear that fighters are being assembled there to intercept the assault force.\"\n\n\"The airfields will not be struck otherwise as they are dual use for military and civilian purposes,\" the memo adds. It was written more than a week before the raid, so it's unclear whether US planning may have been tweaked in the days leading up to the mission.\n\nSatellite imagery revealed damage at the Higuerote Airport on Venezuela's northern coast, dozens of miles east of Caracas, after the raid. Photos from the tarmac showed a destroyed air defense system and a wrecked light aircraft.\n\nAlthough the US didn't appear to have faced the substantial resistance it expected, it still faced some during the raid. American forces stormed Maduro's compound under heavy fire, and at some point, a helicopter took a hit, reportedly by gunfire, but it remained flyable.\n\nA defense official said that seven US service members were wounded in the raid. \"The fact that this extremely complex and grueling mission was successfully executed with so few injuries is a testament to the expertise of our joint warriors,\" they added.\n\nVenezuela and Cuba said dozens of their security personnel were killed during the raid.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Kiki Rice celebrated her 22nd birthday in style, as third-ranked UCLA stayed unbeaten in Big Ten play with a decisive victory at Minnesota.\n\nThe smooth-shooting senior guard was in the spotlight on Wednesday night, with a career high-tying 25 points, but that's not the goal on this well-connected, fiercely determined and richly talented Bruins team.\n\nWith the Gophers and their nation-leading defense trying everything they could to limit star Lauren Betts around the basket, this was prime time for Rice to take over.\n\n“She came here with a single focus, to help our team win at levels they’d never won before, but on top of that, what do you think WNBA teams are looking for? Winners,” UCLA coach Cori Close said. “Ones that not only know how to bring the skill development and the skills to their particular teams, but who helps make the team winners, and I don’t think that can be stated strong enough. Does someone want to pick a stat line? Or do they want to pick a winner?”\n\nThe 5-foot-11 Rice, who added five assists, four rebounds and three steals while shooting 8 for 9 from the floor, 3 for 3 from 3-point range and 6 for 6 from the free-throw line against Minnesota, is a sure-bet first-round pick whenever the WNBA holds its next draft, with a new collective bargaining agreement needed first.\n\nBetts could be the top pick. Gabriela Jaquez, Angela Dugalic and newcomers Gianna Kneepkens and Charlisse Leger-Walker are all WNBA prospects, too, and they're all in their final year.\n\n“This is just a special group, and I’m a really lucky coach to be able to be a part of their lives,” said Close, who's in her 15th season with the Bruins after leading them to their first Final Four appearance last spring.\n\nThe players clearly feel that way, too.\n\n“I just want this team to win, so whatever it takes I’m going to be able to do that,” Rice said.\n\nRice's season-best performance was made possible by the Bruins following their game plan to put the Gophers post players in frequent ball-screen situations and her working hard to take advantage.\n\nWith Betts on the bench in early foul trouble in the second quarter in a six-point game, the Gophers — who entered the game allowing an average of just over 51 points per game — were putting on a clinic on a defensive possession until Rice found space in the corner for a 3-pointer to beat the shot clock and make it 25-16.\n\n“They’re such a physical team, and that wears on you and all of a sudden you can’t get to a coverage as quickly because you got worn down. It’s every cut. It’s every screen. It’s every drive. It’s every rebound. It’s every post-up opportunity,\" Minnesota coach Dawn Plitzuweit said. “Kiki Rice made us pay.\"\n\nUCLA is the best-shooting team in the Big Ten and fifth in the nation, entering the night with a 50.8% percentage from the floor. The Bruins are also third in the country in assists.\n\nThe Gophers made the 6-foot-7 Betts work for everything she got, flexing their feisty defense and forcing the Bruins into 17 turnovers. But the AP preseason All-American senior stayed on the floor and didn’t lose her aggressiveness after picking up her third foul early in the third quarter, and UCLA's lead stayed in double digits for the entire second half on the way to a 76-58 win.\n\n“Playing with Lauren has been one of the best parts of being at UCLA,” Rice said of her teammate who transferred from Stanford three years ago. “Being able to play with a great big like her, not many people in college basketball get the opportunity to do that.”\n\nBetts leaned over toward Rice after the compliment as they sat together at a podium following the game, flashing a smile of gratitude.\n\n“If they’re going to send two or three people at me, it just creates such good opportunities for the guards,” Betts said. “They all can handle themselves really well, and we have such amazing shooters so it makes my job pretty easy.”\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "fullText": "PARIS (AP) — Lens has gone from surprise front-runner to serious title contender in Ligue 1.\n\nDespite having modest resources, coach Pierre Sage has done remarkably well to keep his side ahead of defending champion Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nCash-rich PSG clinched a record-extending 13th league title last season while Lens won its only title in 1998. But Lens pushed PSG close in 2022-23 and finished runner-up by one point.\n\nLens is one point ahead of PSG this season and eight clear of third-place Marseille going into this weekend's 18th round of games.\n\nSage’s side will be confident of a club record-extending 10th straight win in all competitions when it hosts next-to-last Auxerre on Saturday.\n\nExcellent teamwork and a strong defense are hallmarks of a Lens side which has five clean sheets in the past nine games.\n\nPSG has a tricky home match against fourth-placed Lille on Friday at Parc des Princes, just days after being knocked out of the French Cup at home by capital city rival Paris FC.\n\nInconsistent Marseille is at mid-table Angers on Saturday and can ill afford to drop any points with Lille level on points.\n\nErratic Monaco has tumbled to midtable and needs to bounce back with a home win against Lorient on Friday.\n\nLyon fans will be hoping to see Brazil forward Endrick in action at home to Brest on Sunday.\n\nEndrick is on loan from Real Madrid until the end of the season and scored on his club debut in the French Cup on Sunday.\n\nAfter missing 14 games due to a shoulder injury, Marseille forward Amine Gouiri is finding his form. He scored twice and provided one assist in a 9-0 French Cup win on Tuesday.\n\nNantes has earned a reputation over the years for having a strong youth academy and Tylel Tati is the latest to come through. The 17-year-old central defender looked assured in a 2-0 win at Marseille and looks set to feature at home to Paris FC on Sunday. Forward Jonathan Ikoné seeks his first league goal of the season after his neat finish knocked title holder PSG — his former club — out of the French Cup.\n\nPaul Pogba's move to Monaco is not working out as planned and the former France midfield star remains sidelined with a calf injury.\n\nThe 2018 World Cup winner has also dealt with thigh and ankle problems since joining the club in the offseason, after more than two years out of the game in a career derailed by injuries, off-field problems and a doping ban.\n\nPogba hoped to relaunch his career in time to make France's squad for the World Cup later this year but has so far played only 30 minutes in three substitute appearances for Monaco.\n\nMonaco's injury list is long, including defender Mohammed Salisu (ACL), winger Ansu Fati (hamstring), goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky (knee) and winger Takumi Minamino (ACL).\n\nForwards Jérémie Boga and Terem Moffi are reportedly trying to terminate their contracts with Nice after being attacked by their own supporters following a game on Nov. 30.\n\nAfter a 3-1 defeat at Lorient made it six straight losses, Nice players were confronted by a large number of angry Nice fans when they returned to the club’s training and academy center.\n\nBoga and Moffi took blows to the head and groin and have since been on medical leave. According to sports daily L'Équipe, their case is being examined by the French soccer league's legal committee.\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

    "title": "Ukraine's new defense minister just outlined how dire its troop shortage has become",
    "description": "In his remarks at Ukraine's parliament, Mykhailo Fedorov warned of nearly 2 million Ukrainians dodging the military draft.",
    "fullText": "Around 2 million Ukrainians are dodging military drafts, while another 200,000 are absent without official leave, or AWOL, Kyiv's newly appointed defense minister said on Wednesday.\n\nThe tally revealed by Mykhailo Fedorov is a rare disclosure by the Ukrainian leadership about the troop shortages the country has grappled with throughout the war.\n\nFedorov, who was previously minister of digital transformation, was speaking in Ukraine's parliament as representatives confirmed his new appointment in the defense role.\n\nThe defense minister said roughly 2 million Ukrainians are \"wanted\" for evading callups, with another 200,000 soldiers voluntarily leaving their posts without permission to do so.\n\nFedorov has pledged wide reform, saying he would audit Ukraine's military and root out systemic issues \"that have accumulated over the years\" in training and command.\n\n\"We cannot fight with new technologies under an old organizational structure,\" Fedorov said.\n\nUnder martial law in Ukraine, going AWOL is defined as being away without permission for more than three days, an act that can carry a prison sentence of between five to 10 years. Desertion is when a soldier is deemed to be intentionally avoiding service and carries a more severe sentence of up to 12 years in prison.\n\nA soldier could go AWOL if they are given a break from the fighting or leave to return home, then fail to show up when ordered to do so. Sometimes, troops simply flee their positions.\n\nThe figures relayed by Fedorov may be affected by a notorious tactic among Ukrainian troops seeking to transfer to another unit, especially if they were previously denied. Some soldiers try to circumvent the official process by going AWOL and then reporting for duty again with a recommendation for their desired unit.\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general's office told local media outlet Ukrainska Pravda last year that, from the start of the war to September 2025, it had opened over 235,000 criminal cases for AWOL-related offenses, as well as over 53,000 for desertion.\n\nAs a loose comparison, some records say that a rough total of 150,000 American and British troops deserted or went AWOL during World War II across the entire European theater.\n\nAnother key concern implied in Fedorov's speech is the sheer scale of missing recruits that Kyiv desperately needs.\n\nThe country is already straining against Russia's much larger war economy and military industrial complex, and one of its most pressing needs is to replenish its fighters on the front lines.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that his country fields around 880,000 active-duty personnel, though other estimates vary.\n\nThe lack of reinforcements is crushing both for Ukrainian morale and operational success. Without reinforcements, some Ukrainian units have reported holding frontline positions for years with barely any rest or opportunity to rotate out to see their families.\n\nIn the city of Pokrovsk, for example, Zelenskyy said that Kyiv's troops were outnumbered 1 to 8 in the fall, when Russia aggressively tried to take control of the devastated regional hub via repeated ground assaults.\n\nUkrainian men aged 25 to 60 are eligible to be called up for active duty, though those as young as 18 must register with the military. Thousands of Ukrainian men have fled overseas since the war started. Many have done so illegally; Ukraine doesn't allow men aged 23 to 60 to leave its borders.\n\nFedorov said a key focus of his audit would be to assess what Ukraine can do more efficiently with the troops it has now. One of these reform goals is to ensure basic-level staffing in all of Ukraine's drone brigades, which he said is now \"definitely lacking.\"\n\n\"Today, the top 50 out of 400 total units involved in drones provide 70% of enemy damage,\" he said. \"Imagine the potential of the defense forces if we help the remaining 350 grow.\"\n\nThe defense minister, who is 35, also said the Ukrainian military is starting the year with considerably fewer resources. Its budget for 2026 is roughly 300 billion Ukrainian hryvnias, or $7 billion, lower than that for 2025, Fedorov said.",

The former head of Ukraine’s digital transformation policies is credited with spearheading the the army's drone technology and introducing several successful e-government platforms.\n\nHis appointment was part of a broad government reshuffle that the Ukrainian leader said aimed to sharpen the focus on security, defense development and diplomacy amid a new U.S.-led push to find a peace settlement.\n\nFedorov said the defense ministry is facing a shortfall of 300 billion hryvnia ($6.9 billion) in funding needs.\n\nThe European Union will dedicate most of a massive new loan program to help fund Ukraine’s military and economy over the next two years, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday.\n\nFedorov said Ukraine’s defense sector has expanded significantly since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. At the start of the war, he said, the country had seven private drone companies and two firms developing electronic warfare systems. Today, he said, there are nearly 500 drone manufacturers and about 200 electronic warfare companies in Ukraine.\n\nHe added that some sectors have emerged from scratch, including private missile producers, which now number about 20, and more than 100 companies manufacturing ground-based robotic systems.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "The Houston Texans' defense dominated the Pittsburgh Steelers, but C.J. Stroud's sloppiness (three turnovers) was cause for concern.",
    "fullText": "PITTSBURGH — Stating the obvious here, the Houston Texans’ defense is championship caliber – to the point they may carry the entire roster to northern California themselves within the next month.\n\nThat also means the pressure is on quarterback C.J. Stroud and the other side of the ball, because not supporting what has developed into one of the most simultaneously suffocating and crushing units in recent memory would be to waste a potentially deep postseason run in a weaker AFC field.\n\nDeMeco Ryans’ unit scored twice in Houston’s 30-6 rout of the Pittsburgh Steelers in the wild-card round Monday, Jan. 13, at Acrisure Stadium. The concerning part is that Stroud’s carelessness with the football, which resulted in two fumbles lost (five fumbles total and several issues with the snap) and a red-zone interception, kept the Steelers in the game for more than three quarters despite the Texans’ defense ultimately surrendering the fewest points and yards in team postseason history.\n\n\"Bad plays happen, turnovers happen in a game,\" Ryans said. \"We bounced back and didn’t let that affect us the rest of the game.\"\n\nThe defense was credited with 12 hits against Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, whom they sacked four times.\n\nRyans liked that the offense finished the game strong regardless of prior mistakes. Stroud still displayed his flashes of greatness. There was the first third-down throw of the game to Christian Kirk for 36 yards and a third-and-15 completion to Kirk for 46 yards on the final play of the third quarter, which flipped the field and led to a Ka'imi Fairbairn field goal that made it 10-6.\n\n\"He didn’t waver,\" Ryans said of Stroud. \"You can easily go in the tank, but he didn’t waver. That’s who he is. He is a resilient young man who’s able to bounce back. Anybody can go in the tank (after) you drop the ball a few times. You keep battling. Like, the game isn’t over.\"\n\nIn Ryans’ third season (and Stroud’s), the Texans are 3-0 in wild-card games. They are the second head coach-quarterback duo since 1950 to make it to the divisional round in each of their first three seasons in the NFL. They will try to avoid going 0-3 in that round Sunday on the road against the New England Patriots (3 p.m. ET, ESPN/ABC).\n\n\"It was an outstanding defensive performance, one of the best that I’ve seen versus a really talented offense, talented quarterback who has played at a high level for a long time,\" Ryans said of facing Rodgers. \"So, I’m proud of our defensive performance. I think this is the best performance we’ve had in our team history, so I’m proud of our guys for that.\"\n\nThe dam eventually broke with less than 12 minutes in the fourth quarter when Rodgers dropped back and Will Anderson Jr. curled around the edge to his blind side. The 2023 No. 3 overall pick dislodged the pigskin while demolishing Rodgers, and Sheldon Rankins picked it up and ran 33 yards for a touchdown to make it 17-6. Calen Bullock intercepted Rodgers with the game already out of reach but housed it 50 yards to make it 30-6.\n\n\"I think our defense has played like this all year,\" Stroud said. \"They've held us up. I think this is one of the best performances I've ever seen. It's crazy to think the last three wild-card games I've played in they've always had a pick six and some type of two-turnover game. When you have a defense like that it's really, really encouraging.\"\n\nThe offensive line, a sore spot for the past two seasons that has clouded Stroud’s development, held up against a Steelers’ front that could have been more disruptive. Instead, the blockers gave Stroud plenty of time and were difference-makers in the run game. Rookie Woody Marks went for a season-high 112 rushing yards on 19 attempts, while Nick Chubb ran hard for 48 yards on 10 carries. Stroud completed 21 of 32 passes for 250 passing yards, and six different receivers caught at least two passes, with Kirk leading the way (8 catches, 144 yards, 1 touchdown). Nico Collins’ concussion will be something to monitor leading into the matchup against New England.\n\nThe line was instrumental in sustaining two lengthy touchdown drives. The first was a 14-play, 92-yard sequence in which the Texans rushed seven times for 55 yards and took 7:01 off the clock. Marks’ 13-yard touchdown with 3:43 left in the fourth capped a five-minute, 51-second possession. Stroud’s efficiency on third down – the Texans started the game 7-for-9 – was another positive. Stroud said every teammate has a high standard of accountability.\n\n\"It's not just on C.J., not just on me,\" Stroud said. \"I've been on teams like that, where there is a lot of the pressure (on me). Everybody is, ‘I could have done this better,’ I could have done that better.’ I think it does start with me. I got to take care of the football.

    "description": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google’s AI engine inside the Pentagon network.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google’s generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military’s data as possible into the developing technology.\n\n“Very soon we will have the world’s leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,” Hegseth said in a speech at Musk’s space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas.\n\nThe announcement comes just days after Grok — which is embedded into X, the social media network owned by Musk — drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.\n\nMalaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the U.K.’s independent online safety watchdog announced an investigation Monday. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users.\n\nHegseth said Grok will go live inside the Defense Department later this month and announced that he would “make all appropriate data” from the military’s IT systems available for “AI exploitation.” He also said data from intelligence databases would be fed into AI systems.\n\nHegseth’s aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the Biden administration, which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly.\n\nThe Biden administration enacted a framework in late 2024 that directed national security agencies to expand their use of the most advanced AI systems but prohibited certain uses, such as applications that would violate constitutionally protected civil rights or any system that would automate the deployment of nuclear weapons. It is unclear if those prohibitions are still in place under the Trump administration.\n\nDuring his speech, Hegseth spoke of the need to streamline and speed up technological innovations within the military, saying, “We need innovation to come from anywhere and evolve with speed and purpose.”\n\nHe noted that the Pentagon possesses “combat-proven operational data from two decades of military and intelligence operations.”\n\n“AI is only as good as the data that it receives, and we’re going to make sure that it’s there,” Hegseth said.\n\nThe defense secretary said he wants AI systems within the Pentagon to be responsible, though he went on to say he was shrugging off any AI models “that won’t allow you to fight wars.”\n\nHegseth said his vision for military AI systems means that they operate “without ideological constraints that limit lawful military applications,” before adding that the Pentagon’s “AI will not be woke.”\n\nMusk developed and pitched Grok as an alternative to what he called “woke AI” interactions from rival chatbots like Google’s Gemini or OpenAI’s ChatGPT. In July, Grok also caused controversy after it appeared to make antisemitic comments that praised Adolf Hitler and shared several antisemitic posts.\n\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to questions about the issues with Grok.",

    "description": "With both of their futures up in the air, Aaron Rodgers had a lot to say about Mike Tomlin's job security on Monday night.",
    "fullText": "Aaron Rodgers calls out 'Twitter experts' during passionate defense of Steelers coach Mike Tomlin originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nArguably two most important positions in football are up in the air for the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nNot only could quarterback Aaron Rodgers be heading for retirement this offseason, leaving the Steelers without a plan at the position, but head coach Mike Tomlin has been speculated as a candidate to part ways with the team after nearly two decades. After Monday's 30-6 playoff loss to the Houston Texans, the next questions for Pittsburgh revolve around Rodgers and Tomlin.\n\nIn Rodgers' opinion, however, there should be no questions over Tomlin's job security with the Steelers. The veteran quarterback spoke at-length in his postgame press conference on Monday about how silly he found it that Tomlin, one of the best coaches in NFL history, would be on the \"hot seat.\"\n\nHere's what Rodgers had to say about Mike Tomlin potentially being fired by the Steelers.\n\nWhat Aaron Rodgers said about potential NFL retirement\n\n3 reasons why Aaron Rodgers should come back for 2026 season\n\nRodgers is typically a hot commodity at his press conferences, and for many reasons, his postgame presser after Monday's playoff loss may have been his most important of the 2025 season. The question many fans wanted to know, of course, was if he'd be returning to the NFL in 2026.\n\nRodgers, however, said \"I'm not gonna talk about that.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to make any emotional decisions,\" Rodgers said. \"I'm disappointed. It was such a fun year. Lot of adversity, but a lot of fun.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to make any emotional decisions.\"\n\n–Aaron Rodgers when asked about his future. pic.twitter.com/3gU7HNNVC1\n\n— ESPN (@espn) January 13, 2026\n\nWhile Rodgers didn't have a lot to say about his own future, he did have a lot to say about Mike Tomlin's future in Pittsburgh.\n\nMORE: Will Aaron Rodgers retire?\n\nPostgame on Monday, Rodgers was asked about Tomlin, who hasn't led the Steelers to a playoff win since 2016 despite six postseason trips since then. Despite rumors that Pittsburgh could choose to part ways with its longtime coach, Rodgers wasn't buying it.\n\nIn a lengthy rant about how opinions from media and \"Twitter experts\" have affected the coach's job security, Rodgers said he disagrees with the idea that teams should move on from good coaches just because of outside pressure.\n\n\"This league has changed a lot in 21 years. When you hear conversations about the 'Mike Tomlins' of the world, the 'Matt LaFleurs' of the world, those are just two that I played for. And when I first got in the league, there wouldn't be conversations about whether those guys were on the 'hot seat,'\" Rodgers said. \"But the way that the league is covered now, and the way that there's snap decisions, and a validity given to the 'Twitter experts' and all the experts on TV now ... to me that's an absolute joke.\"\n\n\"Mike T. has had more success than damn-near everybody in the league for the last 19, 20 years. More than that, when you have the right guy, and the culture is right, you don't think about making a change. But there's a lot of pressure that comes from the outside, and obviously that sways decisions from time-to-time. But it's not how I would do things, and not how they used to be.\"\n\nAaron Rodgers, when asked about Mike Tomlin, speaks on Tomlin and on #Packers head coach Matt LaFleur after the @Steelers’ playoff loss: pic.twitter.com/gTNmgQT6Qw\n\n— Jason Wilde (@jasonjwilde) January 13, 2026\n\nRodgers was then asked another Tomlin-related question after that, and he didn't respond well.\n\n\"I’ve talked extensively about how I feel about Mike. And I just did in that f****** answer. Thanks,\" Rodgers said before walking away from the podium.\n\nAfter giving a lengthy answer in support of Mike Tomlin, Aaron Rodgers was asked another Tomlin question…\n\n“I’ve talked extensively about how I feel about Mike … and I just did in that fu**ing answer.”\n\nAnd bye. ✌️ pic.twitter.com/u7hIwzWuea\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) January 13, 2026\n\nTexans defense stifles Aaron Rodgers, Steelers in wild-card win\n\nWill Mike Tomlin, Steelers part ways after another first-round playoff exit?\n\nHow Steelers failed to take advantage of C.J.

    "description": "A 42-point effort from Luka Doncic isn't enough for the Lakers to overcome Sacramento's 59% shooting and 17 three-pointers in 124-112 a loss.",
    "fullText": "Lakers coach JJ Redick was asked before Monday's game against the Sacramento Kings how he could ensure his players wouldn't underestimate a nine-win team.\n\n“We don't look at any game as a walkover,” Redick said.\n\nThen the Kings walked all over the Lakers, taking a 20-point lead in the third quarter before winning 124-112 at Golden 1 Center.\n\nLuka Doncic did his best to keep the Lakers in the game, scoring 42 points and collecting eight assists and seven rebounds. But he scored just two points in the fourth quarter and looked slower after having his left thigh wrapped at the end of the third quarter.\n\nThe Lakers got to within seven points in the fourth, but the Kings pulled away. DeMar DeRozan scored 32 points and Russell Westbrook finished with 22 points and seven assists for the Kings (10-30), who shot 59% from the field (48-82) and made 17 three-pointers.\n\nLeBron James, who scored 22 points, wore a patch on his jersey commemorating his unprecedented 23rd NBA season in the city where he played his first NBA game. It features a silhouette of his pregame chalk toss and three colored stripes that represents the three franchises he has played on — the Lakers, Cavaliers and Heat.\n\nHe will wear the patch for the remainder of the season. After each game, the patch will be removed from his jersey, dated and shipped to a Topps’ production facility to be authenticated and inserted into a pack of trading cards.\n\nThe Lakers (23-14) looked strong from the onset when Deandre Ayton won the jump ball and eventually threw a lob pass to James for a 2-0 Lakers lead, a play that has become something the Lakers have used several times to start a game.\n\nJames hit his first four shots and the Lakers took an 8-2 lead before everything started to crumble.\n\nThey were behind 59-43 late in the second quarter. They couldn’t stop Malik Monk, who had 18 points off the bench on six-for-eight shooting, including five for six from three-point range. Monk finished with 26 points.\n\nAfter the hot start, James finished the first half going five for 12 from the field for 12 points. He finished the game shooting eight for 17.\n\nThe Lakers will play the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday night at Crypto.com Arena. When the Lakers played a back-to-back game last week, James sat out the second game. Will he do the same Tuesday?\n\n“We’ll see how he feels in the morning,” Redick said.\n\nPerhaps Rui Hachimura will make his return from right calf soreness. He was available to play Monday, but he sat out his seventh consecutive game.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "The Lakers defense went from on the mend to very weak on Monday, and it resulted in an unacceptable loss to the Kings.",
    "fullText": "After back-to-back losses to the San Antonio Spurs and Milwaukee Bucks, the Los Angeles Lakers looked to get back in the win column when they faced the struggling Sacramento Kings on Monday. Sacramento had just ended a seven-game losing streak, and it came into this game with a 9-30 record, which was the second-worst record in the Western Conference.\n\nThe Lakers got out to an early 19-10 lead thanks to some active defense and several fast-break scores. But they went cold for an extended stretch soon afterward and fell behind by as many as 16 points in the second quarter. An 11-2 Lakers run brought them to within 61-54 at halftime, but Sacramento boosted its lead to 20 minutes later, and the Lakers were never able to mount a serious rally, resulting in a 124-112 loss for them.\n\nEven without three-time All-Star center Domantas Sabonis, who has a meniscus injury, the Kings were able to steamroll L.A. with some precise execution and offense. They shot 58.5% from the field and an unbelievable 65.4% from 3-point range, and they caught Los Angeles slow on its defensive rotations to 3-point shooters. Guard Malik Monk, a former Laker, burned his old team with 26 points and seven treys off the bench. Even Russell Westbrook, another former Laker, hit four of his eight attempts from downtown.\n\nLos Angeles' defense wasn't the only problem. While it shot 48.8% overall, it was just 8-of-36 from beyond the arc and had a pronounced lack of offensive balance. Only four of its players hit double figures in scoring, and only two of its men had more than 13 points.\n\nThe Lakers are now on a three-game losing streak, and with a 23-14 record, they're still in fifth place in the Western Conference, but they're in a virtual tie with the sixth-place Phoenix Suns. They're only half a game ahead of the Houston Rockets, who are in seventh place, and they will return home to face the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday.\n\nSmart had some moments where he played effective defense, but he was a liability on the other end of the court. He missed all five of his shot attempts and scored one point, to go along with two rebounds, two assists and two steals in 31 minutes.\n\nLaRavia was another player who contributed next to nothing offensively. He missed six of his seven shot attempts and went 0-of-5 from 3-point range, and he ended up with two points, two rebounds, three assists and one steal in 31 minutes.\n\nAyton had nine rebounds in the first half and 13 for the game, including five on the offensive glass, and he went 4-of-7 from the field. While he got eight free throw attempts, which is a high and unusual amount for him, he made just five of them, which limited him to 13 points in 27 minutes. Ayton also contributed one assist and two blocks, but L.A. could've used a little more scoring from him.\n\nJames got off to a hot start in this game with several transition buckets and 10 points overall in the first quarter. But he faded afterward and finished with an anemic 22 points on 8-of-17 field-goal shooting while missing all five of his 3-point tries. He also had four rebounds, three assists and one steal in 33 minutes.\n\nDoncic, at times, almost single-handedly prevented L.A. from falling completely out of this contest early on. He had 26 first-half points on 10-of-14 shooting, with 15 of them coming in bunches during the second quarter. He tried to put his team on his back and carry it toward a comeback, but he didn't receive nearly enough help.\n\nIn all, he scored 42 points and went 16-of-25 from the field, although he was 2-of-9 from downtown. Doncic also helped out with seven rebounds, eight assists and four steals.\n\nThis was a relatively quiet night for Vanderbilt. In 26 minutes, he got four rebounds, but he missed his three field-goal attempts and went scoreless.\n\nVincent went 3-of-6 overall and 3-of-5 from downtown, giving him nine points, plus one assist and one steal, in 18 minutes. He hit two of his treys early in the fourth quarter to try to jump-start a Lakers comeback, but to no avail.\n\nHayes was fairly aggressive and energetic throughout this contest. He got 19 minutes of playing time, and he made five of his six shot attempts to finish with 12 points, while also grabbing four offensive rebounds and five total boards.\n\nKnecht got onto the court for 13 minutes and hit two of his six shot attempts, including one 3-pointer. He finished with five points, two rebounds and one assist.\n\nThe younger James, Kleber and Smith each played only during the final 1:53 of this game. The younger James hit both of his shot attempts and scored six points, while Kleber and Smith went scoreless.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers player grades: L.A. gets steamrolled by Kings",

    "fullText": "The Defense Department has spent more than a year testing a device purchased in an undercover operation that some investigators think could be the cause of a series of mysterious ailments impacting US spies, diplomats and troops that are colloquially known as Havana Syndrome, according to four sources briefed on the matter.\n\nA division of the Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations, purchased the device for millions of dollars in the waning days of the Biden administration, using funding provided by the Defense Department, according to two of the sources. Officials paid “eight figures” for the device, these people said, declining to offer a more specific number.\n\nThe device is still being studied and there is ongoing debate — and in some quarters of government, skepticism — over its link to the roughly dozens of anomalous health incidents that remain officially unexplained.\n\nCNN has asked the Pentagon, HSI and the DHS for comment. The CIA declined to comment.\n\nThe device acquired by HSI produces pulsed radio waves, one of the sources said, which some officials and academics have speculated for years could be the cause of the incidents. Although the device is not entirely Russian in origin, it contains Russian components, this person added.\n\nOfficials have long struggled to understand how a device powerful enough to cause the kind of damage some victims have reported could be made portable; that remains a core question, according to one of the sources briefed on the device. The device could fit in a backpack, this person said.\n\nThe acquisition of the device has reignited a painful and contentious debate within the US government about Havana Syndrome, known officially as “anomalous health episodes.”\n\nThe mysterious illness first emerged in late 2016, when a cluster of US diplomats stationed in the Cuban capital of Havana began reporting symptoms consistent with head trauma, including vertigo and extreme headaches. In subsequent years, there have been cases reported around the world.\n\nIn the subsequent decade the intelligence community and the Defense Department have sought to understand if those officials were the victims of some kind of directed energy attack by a foreign government — with senior intelligence officials saying publicly that there wasn’t enough evidence to support that conclusion and victims arguing that the US government has gaslit them and ignored important evidence that Russia was attacking American government officials.\n\nStill, defense officials considered their findings serious enough that they briefed the House and Senate Intelligence Committees late last year, including reference to the acquired device and its testing.\n\nOne key concern now for some officials is that if the technology proves viable it may have proliferated, several of the sources said, meaning that more than one country could now have access to a device that may be capable of causing career-ending injuries to US officials.\n\nCNN was not able to learn where — or from whom — HSI purchased the device, but HSI has a history of collaboration with the Defense Department for operations that take place all over the globe. The office has broad jurisdiction to investigate crimes linked to customs violations, including investigations into the proliferation of US-controlled technology or expertise overseas.\n\nThose investigations are “the single biggest collaboration point between HSI and the US military,” according to a former Homeland Security official.\n\nFor example, when the US military came across US technology in Afghanistan or Iraq that raised questions about how those components came to the region, it would turn to HSI, according to the official.\n\nIt was also not clear how the US government learned of the existence of the device in order to purchase it. Havana Syndrome — and its cause — have remained frustratingly opaque to both the intelligence community and the medical community.\n\nOne problem facing the medical community is that there is still not a clear definition of “anomalous health incidents” or AHIs. Tests were done, in some cases, long after symptoms began, making it harder to understand what physically happened.\n\nIn 2022, an intelligence panel investigating the cause of AHIs said that some of the episodes could “plausibly” have been caused by “pulsed electromagnetic energy” emitted by an external source.\n\nBut in 2023, the intelligence community said publicly that it could not link any cases to a foreign adversary, ruling it unlikely that the unexplained illness was the result of a targeted campaign by an enemy of the US. As recently as January of 2025, the broader intelligence community assessment remained that it was very unlikely that the symptoms were caused by a foreign actor — even as an official with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence emphasized that analysts cannot “rule out” the possibility in some small number of cases.\n\nThat stance has long incensed victims, many of whom believe strongly that intelligence exists offering black-and-white evidence that Russia is behind their symptoms, some of which have been severe enough to force retirement.\n\nSome current and former CIA officers have raised concerns that the agency soft-pedaled its investigation, CNN has previously reported.\n\nThe acquisition of the device has been treated by some victims as potential vindication.\n\n“If the [US government] has indeed uncovered such devices, then the CIA owes all the victims a f**king major and public apology for how we have been treated as pariahs,” Marc Polymeropoulos, one of the first CIA officers to go public with injuries he says he sustained in an attack in Moscow in 2017, said in a statement to CNN.\n\nCNN’s Kylie Atwood contributed to this story.",

He rejected Fein's request for the judge to summon Maduro to court to ask him if he would like Fein added to the defense team.\n\n“If Maduro wishes to retain Fein, he has the ability to do so,\" Hellerstein wrote. \"Fein cannot appoint himself to represent Maduro.\"\n\nMessages seeking comment were left Monday for Fein and Pollack.\n\nPollack, a prominent Washington lawyer whose clients have included WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, was the only lawyer with Maduro at his Jan. 5 arraignment in Manhattan federal court, days after U.S. special forces seized Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, from their home in Caracas.\n\nIn court, Maduro called it a kidnapping and declared himself a prisoner of war. Pollack told Hellerstein he expected to make “substantial” court filings challenging the legality of his military abduction\" and invoking immunity as the head of a sovereign state.\n\nAs Fein sought to join the case, Pollack said in a court filing last week that he'd spoken with Maduro and that the ex-leader confirmed to him that he doesn't know Fein and has not communicated with him, much less retained him or authorized him to join the case.\n\nFein acknowledged in a written response that he'd had no contact with Maduro by telephone, video or any other direct way.\n\nMaduro and Flores have pleaded not guilty to charges alleging he worked with drug cartels to facilitate the shipment of thousands of tons of cocaine into the U.S. They remain held without bail at a federal jail in Brooklyn and are due back in court on March 17.",

    "fullText": "The Texans' Offensive Keys To Beating Pittsburgh originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Houston Texans are known for their defense. They have two incredible pass rushers in Will Anderson Jr. and Danielle Hunter, Azeez Al-Shaair is the solid in the middle of that defense and their secondary, led by Derek Stingley Jr. and one of the best nickelbacks in the NFL, Jalen Pitre. But as it is in every game with every team, both sides of the ball count. The Texans' offense has had moments where they have shone, moments where they have disappeared, and other times where you don’t know what is going on. Their defense is Super Bowl-worthy, but the questions remain on the offensive side of the ball, starting with the Pittsburgh. Here are some things they must do to help their offense and pull off the win against the AFC North Champion Steelers.\n\nThe Texans have been predictable at times offensively. And that has led opposing defenses to know precisely how to defend them. To change that up, the rhythm has to change as well. The Texans ought to come out and take shots against the Steelers, as they did against the Chargers in Week 17. They scored on big-time plays in the first quarter and took an early lead that they never relinquished. In the playoffs, getting an early lead is enormous and would be beneficial for the Texans, especially their defense, as it would allow their pass-rushers to pin their ears back just a little bit more. And besides, the Steelers' defense showed they can be fooled when they think they know what you are doing.\n\nThis is already going to be a challenging game for the Pittsburgh Steelers offense, so don’t give them any help. The Texans have had times where they have given up the football and helped other teams stay in the game. Texans quarterback CJ Stroud has to value the football even when pressure is coming at him. Throw the football away or take the sack as opposed to throwing the football up for grabs. That is the best way to get beaten by Pittsburgh: to put your defense in bad positions. The less you do that and the more you make Pittsburgh have to drive long distances to score, the better the Texans’ chances to win the game.\n\nThe Texans' offensive line has been something to watch all year, and for the most part, that hasn't been a good thing. They have missed assignments in the run and pass game, making it difficult for the offense to move the ball. They have also had moments where they have held up more consistently. In this game, they are going to need the best their offensive line has to offer. TJ Watt and Cameron Heyward are exceptional defensive talents who can cause real problems. The better the Texans perform up front, the easier it will be to support the Texans' defense. Texans offensive line: all eyes are on you tonight.\n\nMonday Night Football for the world to see. Can the Texans get it done, or will they falter in prime time? We shall see tonight. But we do know the Texans' offense will have some say-so in how this one goes.",

    "description": "New England held Los Angeles to 207 yards of offense and sacked Justin Herbert six times.",
    "fullText": "Patriots coach Mike Vrabel talked to his team about being prepared to bleed as New England entered its first playoff game since the 2021 season.\n\nThen, shortly after Milton Williams sacked the Chargers’ Justin Herbert on Sunday night to secure the Patriots’ first playoff victory in seven years, Williams celebrated with a head-butt of Vrabel.\n\nIt knocked the first-year coach backward and bloodied his lip.\n\n“The big dogs come out in January. I think Milt took that to heart,” Vrabel said. “He came over and got me pretty good. But that’s what happens.”\n\nDrake Maye threw a touchdown pass to Hunter Henry in the fourth quarter, and New England’s defense roughed up Herbert as the Patriots beat Los Angeles 16-3 in an AFC wild-card playoff game.\n\nPLAYOFF DUBBBBBBBB pic.twitter.com/xTUemyhs8f\n\n— New England Patriots (@Patriots) January 12, 2026\n\nAndy Borregales kicked three field goals for the Patriots (15-3), who hadn’t won in the postseason since their Super Bowl victory to cap the 2018 season. They’ll host the winner of Monday night’s game between Pittsburgh and Houston in the divisional round.\n\nIn his playoff debut, Maye completed 17 of 29 passes for 268 yards and ran for a team-high 66 yards.\n\n“We made plays when we had to do it,” Maye said.\n\nHe also threw an interception and lost a fumble, but the Chargers (11-7) couldn’t capitalize on those turnovers.\n\nNew England held Los Angeles to 207 yards of offense and sacked Herbert six times, with one of those resulting in a lost fumble that set up the Patriots’ TD.\n\n“It’s on us, what we do. I’ve been saying that all season,” Williams said. “We can control the game. If we do what we need to do up front, we’re going to win.”\n\nThis is the second straight season in which the Chargers have lost in the wild-card round. Herbert finished 19 of 31 for 159 yards and was his team’s leading rusher with 57 yards as he fell to 0-3 in the playoffs.\n\nHerbert was just over a month removed from surgery to repair a broken bone in his nonthrowing hand.\n\n“There was no issue,” Herbert said. “I just have to do a better job holding on to the ball.”\n\nChargers coach Jim Harbaugh said his quarterback wasn’t 100 percent.\n\nTHIS IS GORGEOUS 🎯@DrakeMaye2 | @Hunter_Henry84 \n\n📺 NBC pic.twitter.com/7TYUczWj3q\n\n— New England Patriots (@Patriots) January 12, 2026\n\n“He’s a warrior. He just gives it everything he has, all the time,” Harbaugh said, acknowledging that Herbert was limited by his hand injury. “It’s an issue, but he doesn’t flinch, like a warrior would.”\n\nThe last time the Chargers failed to score a TD in the playoffs was their 21-12 AFC championship game loss to the Patriots during the 2007 season.\n\nThe Patriots drove into the red zone on their first possession of the third quarter, but the drive ended when Maye was strip-sacked by Odafe Oweh and De’Shawn Hand recovered for the Chargers.\n\nAfter Los Angeles punted, Maye connected on a pass to Kayshon Boutte that went for 42 yards to set the Patriots up on the Chargers 27. But New England settled for a 39-yard field goal that stretched their lead to 9-3.\n\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Maye used a 16-yard pass to Boutte and a 13-yard burst by Rhamondre Stevenson to set up his precise 28-yard TD toss to Henry that put the Patriots in front 16-3.\n\nGET ON THAT!!!!!!\n\n📺 NBC pic.twitter.com/jRUgddmwbj\n\n— New England Patriots (@Patriots) January 12, 2026\n\nThe Chargers picked up back-to-back first downs to open their ensuing drive. But when Herbert dropped back to pass on the next play, linebacker K’Lavon Chaisson strip-sacked him and fell on loose ball.\n\nLos Angeles had one final possession, but it ended with Herbert getting sacked by Williams on fourth down.\n\n“It’s playoff football. It’s going to get ugly. It’s going to get nasty. But you’ve got to keep going,” Williams said.\n\nThe opening quarter had lots of action, but it took until early in the second quarter for the Patriots to end a scoreless stalemate.\n\nWith New England pinned inside its own 10 after a Chargers punt, Maye had a pass intended for Austin Hooper tipped by Teair Tart and intercepted by Daiyan Henley.\n\nLos Angeles started with the ball on the Patriots 10 but was stopped on fourth-and-2 when Herbert misfired a pass to Keenan Allen.\n\nThe Patriots took over and got some breathing room via a 48-yard catch-and-run by Stevenson.\n\nThirteen plays and a fourth-down conversion later, the drive ended with Borregales’ 23-yard field goal.\n\nPatriots: CB Carlton Davis left in the first half with a toe injury but returned. ...

    "title": "Trump's message to defense contractors: There might be a lot more money coming, but only if you deliver",
    "description": "The White House is calling for much more defense spending while pressuring contractors to prioritize production over profits.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump sent jolts through the defense industry this week by mixing talk of a $1.5 trillion defense budget with a blunt warning to contractors: Prioritize production and readiness, not Wall Street.\n\nThe apparent messaging behind a string of Truth Social posts, a new executive order, and the president's call for boosting the defense budget by 50% is that there's going to be a lot of cash on the table, but only for companies that produce and deliver weapons on time.\n\nA venture capital investor focused on aerospace and defense told Business Insider that Trump is effectively saying: \"I've got a really big pool of money here, but I'm only going to be giving it to people that are going to play ball.\"\n\nThe new executive order empowers the Pentagon to pressure contractors that it feels aren't moving fast enough and are perceived to instead be prioritizing profits for top executives and shareholder returns over production demands.\n\nThe Pentagon is now authorized to crack down on underperforming defense contractors by limiting stock buybacks and dividends, linking executive pay to production and delivery, and using contract and emergency authorities to force faster output and investment.\n\nThere are questions about the degree to which the Department of Defense can influence company decisions, but it sends a clear signal that the government intends to at least try to tell weapons makers how to run their businesses.\n\n\"MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS NOT BEING MADE FAST ENOUGH,\" Trump wrote on social media this week before singling out the major defense firm Raytheon (now RTX Corp) in a follow-up post.\n\n\"Either Raytheon steps up,\" Trump wrote, urging the company to build more facilities and equipment, \"or they will no longer be doing business with\" the government. RTX is one of the world's leading producers of missiles like the Tomahawk cruise missile; it also makes radars and sensors, among other technologies.\n\nIt's extremely unusual to see this level of federal government involvement in contractor financial decisions.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like that,\" Jerry McGinn, the director of the Center for the Industrial Base at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, told Business Insider.\n\nDefense stocks tumbled hard with the string of announcements but jumped as the Trump administration floated the possibility of a massive increase in defense spending, which would need Congress's approval.\n\nThis new push reflects growing concern that America’s defense sector has slipped, with capacity, capability, and experience today well below Cold War levels, leaving the US potentially ill-prepared for the possibility of a major war, such as a conflict with China.\n\nThe Trump administration appears to be trying to force a reset while also offering more money and more predictable demand, acknowledging the government itself has not always been a reliable customer. The hollowing out of the defense industry since the Cold War's end has left the federal government highly dependent on a few companies with the necessary industrial facilities to design and produce complex weapons on a large scale.\n\nThe administration has signaled from the get-go that the big established arms makers are in its crosshairs, with a dramatic shift in support toward agile start-ups over the primes, even if it's still making substantial business deals with them.\n\n\"We are going to completely disrupt the system that held the Army back for decades and lined the primes' pockets for so long,\" Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll said last year.\n\nThe Army's top civilian official previously said that he would like to see one of the big defense power players in the contracting world go out of business. And now there's increased pressure.\n\n\"The EO is more of a hammer,\" McGinn said of Trump's newest executive order targeting the US defense industrial base.\n\n\"It still raises a lot of questions about what's enforceable,\" he added, especially with some of the Truth Social mandates that weren't included in the executive order. But \"the strategy is all about focusing on how do you change, how do you make it more attractive for companies to invest, to build factories ahead of need.\"\n\nWith the president's new executive order on defense contracting, the companies that \"stand to lose the most\" are \"the existing primes,\" Justus Parmar, CEO of Fortuna Investments, an America-first venture capital firm, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Legacy defense companies,\" Parmar said, \"they're kind of like taxicabs. They need a bit of disruption.\" He sees the rising defense firms like the ride-share companies that changed the game.\n\nThe primes, the biggest defense contractors, are far from powerless. Their scale, capital, and decades of experience give them room to resist pressure, and in certain defense technologies, they remain the only game in town.\n\nLockheed Martin, for instance, is still producing F-35 stealth fighters, Huntington Ingalls Industries is still building aircraft carriers, and Boeing has a major contract for the new sixth-generation F-47 fighter jet.\n\nWhile some big companies didn't respond, others signaled a willingness to engage. Lockheed Martin, for instance, said it \"shares President Trump's and the Department of War's focus on speed, accountability, and results, and will continue to invest and innovate at scale to ensure our warfighters maintain a decisive advantage and are never sent into a fair fight.\"\n\nThe newcomers, the start-ups and rising firms making big plays \"have the most to gain\" from what's unfolding right now, Parmar said, calling the latest Trump moves a \"tide shift.\"\n\nPalmer Luckey, the founder of Anduril, said this week that he \"broadly\" supports the president's agenda, saying that \"it's good to scare people sometimes.\" Anduril has been pitting itself up against major defense contractors in areas of emerging tech, like collaborative combat aircraft, advanced drones designed to operate alongside piloted fighters.\n\nMcGinn said \"there's a strong recognition that we need to get more out of our defense industrial base and we need new entrants.\" New technology spaces like drones, counter-drone systems, and command and control architecture improvements are opening the doors for new players, particularly those that move fast.\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth laid out the administration's approach last November, briefing industry CEOs and releasing a new acquisition strategy aimed at overhauling what it calls an outdated system and a weakened defense industrial base.\n\nHegseth has said his focus is on building the \"arsenal of freedom\" to better prepare the US military for modern warfare.\n\nThe plan is aimed at accelerating modernization, rapidly expanding production, surging capacity, and putting military acquisition and industry on a \"wartime footing\" that favors speed and execution over process.\n\nThis process takes time though, Parmar said. \"The existing primes, they're entrenched. They're not going anywhere quickly.\"\n\n\"It's going to be a slow bleed,\" he said,\" a slow transition until some of these other companies start to get market share.\"",

    "description": "France's defense ministry picked Mistral to supply military AI systems running on national infrastructure, demonstrating Europe's push for tech sovereignty.",
    "fullText": "French AI startup Mistral has secured a major vote of confidence from its home government after landing a deal to provide AI technology to France's military.\n\nFrance's Ministry of the Armed Forces said on Thursday that it has formally notified a framework agreement with Mistral AI, giving the country's armed forces, defense agencies, and affiliated public institutions access to the company's advanced AI models, software, and services.\n\nUnder the deal overseen by the ministry's defense AI agency, Mistral's AI systems will be deployed on French-controlled infrastructure, a key priority for the military as governments grow increasingly cautious about where sensitive data is processed and which laws govern it.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post announcing the deal, Mistral said its AI systems would be deployed on France's own infrastructure and fine-tuned using defense-specific data to support operational military needs.\n\nThe financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed. Mistral was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Business Insider.\n\nThe agreement marks a significant win for Mistral, which was founded in 2023 and is valued at roughly $13.6 billion, following a 1.7 billion euro ($2 billion) funding round announced last year.\n\nThe startup has positioned itself as a European alternative to US AI heavyweights, such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, pitching its models as powerful yet more compatible with Europe's sovereignty and data control ambitions.\n\nIn its statement, translated by Business Insider, the defense ministry said the partnership is intended to strengthen France's \"technological sovereignty\" and ensure the armed forces maintain control over critical AI tools used across military operations and administration.\n\nBertrand Rondepierre, director of the ministry's defense AI agency, said the agreement represents \"a major step\" in strengthening the ministry's generative AI capabilities and preparing the armed forces for future challenges, while maintaining sovereign control over the technologies used.\n\nThe deal comes as European governments reassess their dependence on US technology in strategic sectors ranging from cloud computing to semiconductors and now AI.\n\nThe French ministry's move mirrors that of the US government, which has increasingly inked major contracts with domestic AI companies to develop tools for military and national security use, including recent deals with OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, and other defense-focused startups.\n\nAs generative AI becomes increasingly embedded in military planning, logistics, and analysis, Mistral's latest win helps to position the startup as one of Europe's key players in the race to develop sovereign alternatives to American tech giants.\n\nDo you work for Mistral and have a tip or story to share?

    "fullText": "The \"TACO trade,\" short for Trump Always Chickens Out, was one of the great market memes of 2025. Whenever the market would throw a tantrum about a Trump policy — usually related to tariffs — the president would reverse course to stem the bleeding.\n\nA similar story has played out this week within US defense stocks, with a few unique twists. Here's the minute-by-minute recap from Wednesday afternoon:\n\nIt was that last statement, 2 hours and 9 minutes after Trump's first post about defense companies, that sparked a rally in those exact same defense stocks on Thursday. The optimism of a huge spending increase had offset the initial sting of industry criticism.\n\nIt wasn't a precise TACO trade situation. It was closer to something I'd like to coin as the TUNA trade: Trump Usually Negates Announcements. The president didn't outright reverse a prior statement. He countered a bearish opinion with something bullish that counterbalanced it. There's a big difference!\n\nThe volatile episode leaves questions unanswered about the future of the industry. The knee-jerk reaction from investors was to buy/sell first, then ask questions later. What does the longer term look like?\n\nWall Street analysts generally support the idea that the additional military spending will offset any new capital restrictions.\n\n\"The changes are significant but not necessarily draconian,\" said JPMorgan analyst Seth Seifman. A \"potential budget increase would support sustained growth, taking some sting out of the executive order.\"\n\nKen Herbert, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, says large-cap defense companies will feel the squeeze more than their defense-tech counterparts, which he sees outperforming.\n\n\"Defense primes will look to de-risk major program investments by securing long-term purchase agreements, where possible,\" he added.\n\nJefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu called Trump's comments an \"overreach\" and said that they catalyzed something that was already bound to happen.\n\n\"The industry has been clear that it is ready to invest on clearer demand signals,\" she said.\n\nFrom a demand perspective, $1.5 trillion in 2027 sounds quite appealing. If all goes according to plan — and that's a big \"if\" — more stock gains could be in store for defense companies.",

    "description": "Defense stocks pay relatively high dividends, but there are alternative areas of the market for investors to consider if they want steady income.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump sent defense stocks on a roller coaster ride this week, and his recent executive orders on defense firms and his calls for more defense spending could impact investors' portfolios.\n\nThe president signed an order aimed at restricting some financial behavior among defense contractors, including an executive order that bans defense firms from issuing dividend payments and doing stock buybacks until they deliver a \"superior product.\" Meanwhile, Trump said on Wednesday that he wants the US military budget could raised to a record $1.5 trillion next year.\n\nBoth developments have implications for investors who have money in the defense sector, which is known for paying relatively high dividends. Lockheed Martin, for instance, has an annual dividend yield of around 2%, compared to about 1% for the broader S&P 500.\n\nHere's the rundown of how investors should be thinking about the latest news — and what it means for their portfolios.\n\nFor the most part, investors shouldn't be thinking about their long-term investments too differently. Trump's push to ban dividend payments seems largely hypothetical, and it's unclear how the president will enforce such a rule, said Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.\n\n\"It feels as though this was making another random social media announcement that will likely die on the vine,\" Hogan told Business Insider. \"I don't know you need to make a rush to judgment in terms of changing your long-term investment plans.\"\n\nBesides the threat of barring dividend payments, Trump's announcements on social media seem largely positive for defense investors, José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, said. He added that those who aren't dependent on dividend payments should remain invested in the sector, pointing to the potential for growth.\n\n\"I think that investors can look forward to improved quality from those companies, in the best-case scenario,\" he told BI.\n\nIf defense companies fall in line and pause dividend payments, that could hurt investors who specifically hold dividend-paying stocks for regular income, Torres said.\n\nBut those investors can move to other dividend-paying areas of the market. Torres encouraged investors to consider value sectors with high dividend yields, such as energy and healthcare.\n\nB. Riley's Hogan encouraged investors to consider areas like energy, consumer staples, pharmaceuticals, utilities, and other parts of the industrial sector, a broader umbrella that covers defense stocks.\n\nDividend ETFs, which track a basket of dividend-paying companies, are also an option for investors chasing dividends, he added.\n\n\"There's a lot of dividend darlings for sure,\" Hogan said. \"I think investors, if in fact they feel nervous about the potential for dividend cuts or the removal of dividends in any space, as unlikely as that prospect seems, there are ways to navigate around that.\"\n\nInvestors should be watching their bond investments, Peter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research, said.\n\nBerezin said that the significant increase in defense spending could lead to a rise in bond yields, which would mean bond prices could fall.\n\nInteractive Brokers' Torres also said he believed bond investors should \"absolutely\" be concerned about the more robust military budget, which could raise long-end bond yields in particular.\n\nLong-end bond yields have climbed in recent years as concerns have risen about the US deficit and rising levels of government debt. Higher debt levels make investors more wary of purchasing long-term US Treasurys, which means yields need to rise to attract investors. Heavy borrowing and spending are also inflationary, which could push yields higher down the road as the central bank adjusts monetary policy to keep prices under control.\n\nTorres didn't recommend selling bonds at the moment. He believes concerns around debt have caused long-end bond yields in the US to be \"too high,\" and he expects those yields to ease soon.\n\n\"I'm a bond bull at this juncture,\" he said.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump took aim at defense contractors on Wednesday in an executive order.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is targeting the bank accounts of defense contractor CEOs.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order outlining new rules for defense contractors that would ban stock buybacks and dividends \"until such time as they are able to produce a superior product, on time and on budget\" — as well as limit executive compensation.\n\nThe order stipulates that in future contracts, if the Secretary of War were unsatisfied with a company's performance, executive base salaries would be capped at current levels. Future contracts would also ensure compensation \"not be tied to short-term financial metrics\" and instead be \"linked to an on-time delivery, increased production, and all necessary facilitation of investments and operating improvements.\"\n\nThe goal, per the executive order, is to increase the speed of innovation at defense companies, rather than focus on corporate profits.\n\nTrump also took aim at the leaders of defense contractors in a series of posts on Truth Social on Wednesday.\n\n\"Executive Pay Packages in the Defense Industry are exorbitant and unjustifiable given how slowly these Companies are delivering vital Equipment to our Military,\" Trump wrote. \"Salaries, Stock Options, and every other form of Compensation are far too high for these Executives.\"\n\nHe proposed that no executive should earn \"in excess of $5 million\" until their production speed and maintenance improve, though the executive order did not cap pay at that exact amount.\n\nThe leaders of the big five defense contractors — Lockheed Martin, RTX (formerly known as Raytheon), Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics — each earned more than $18 million in total compensation in 2024, the most recent year for which data is available. Their total income was a combination of salary, incentives, stock options, and other forms of compensation, including the value of security services and changes in the value of pension funds.\n\nWhile exceeding the $5 million cap proposed by Trump by magnitudes, the CEOs' compensation pales in comparison to that of some other business leaders.\n\nDozens of CEOs earned more than them in 2024. James Robert Anderson, who runs materials manufacturer Coherent, had a pay package of more than $100 million last year. The CEOs of Starbucks, GE, and Microsoft each made more than $75 million.\n\nExecutive pay and stock transactions are part of Trump's larger plans for the military. On Wednesday evening, he said on Truth Social that America's military budget should be increased to $1.5 trillion in 2027, up from the record 2026 defense budget of $901 billion.\n\nThat sent defense stocks climbing on Thursday morning, gaining back what they'd lost following the signing of the executive order.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider regarding the order, a spokesperson for Lockheed Martin said the company \"shares President Trump's and the Department of War's focus on speed, accountability, and results, and will continue to invest and innovate at scale to ensure our warfighters maintain a decisive advantage and are never sent into a fair fight.\"\n\nBoeing and General Dynamics declined to comment, and Northrop Grumman and RTX did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

    "description": "USS Bulkeley and USS Paul Ignatius \"supported\" the operations to seize the vessel, a defense official told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "Two US Navy destroyers helped American forces chase down, board, and ultimately seize a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the North Atlantic after a weekslong chase across the ocean, a defense official told Business Insider on Thursday.\n\nThe Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers USS Bulkeley and USS Paul Ignatius \"supported\" the operations to seize the vessel, initially called Bella 1, on Wednesday, the official said.\n\nThe official declined to provide additional details about the warships' role in the seizure, citing operational security concerns.\n\nThe destroyers' involvement in the mission, which also included the Coast Guard and special operations forces, highlights the scale of the US military's efforts to capture the oil tanker, on the run since it evaded a naval blockade. Flight-tracking data showed various aircraft were airborne either shortly before or during the operation.\n\nThe UK government said it supported the operation with a tanker and Royal Air Force surveillance aircraft. A NATO official told Business Insider that the alliance's standing naval forces were not involved.\n\nBella 1, which has been described by the Trump administration as a \"dark fleet\" tanker operating in violation of sanctions, evaded a US naval blockade of sanctioned vessels near Venezuela last month and avoided attempts by the American military to board the vessel.\n\nThe tanker, sailing under the flag of Guyana, then fled north into the Atlantic, reflagged as a Russian vessel, and changed its name to the Marinera. On the run, the crew even painted the country's tricolor on the hull.\n\nThe Coast Guard pursued the tanker for weeks. The unusual chase ended on Wednesday when American forces seized the vessel in waters about halfway between the UK and Iceland.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told reporters that because the vessel had a judicial seizure order, the ship's crew is \"subject to prosecution for any applicable violation of federal law, and they will be brought to the United States for such prosecution if necessary.\"\n\nRussia's foreign ministry condemned the seizure and said that threats to prosecute the tanker's crew \"are entirely unacceptable,\" the state-owned news agency Tass reported on Thursday.\n\nSeparately, the US military said that it seized another sanctioned tanker — M/T Sophia — near the Caribbean Sea on Wednesday after it was \"conducting illicit activities\" in the region.\n\nThe back-to-back interdictions mark the latest in a string of vessel seizures that have occurred since the US announced last month that a naval blockade on sanctioned oil tankers trying to enter or leave Venezuela was going into effect.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the two tankers that were seized on Wednesday had either \"last docked\" in Venezuela or were sailing to the country.\n\n\"The United States continues to enforce the blockade against all dark fleet vessels illegally transporting Venezuelan oil to finance illicit activity, stealing from the Venezuelan people,\" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday after the operations. \"Only legitimate and lawful energy commerce — as determined by the US — will be permitted.\"\n\nThe US naval blockade was set up as part of a pressure campaign against Venezuela's former president, Nicolás Maduro, whom the US had long accused of facilitating drug trafficking and other criminal activity, allegations he denies.\n\nThe campaign also included a massive US military buildup in the Caribbean that began in August. American forces carried out dozens of airstrikes on alleged drug boats over the following months, as President Donald Trump threatened to take action against Venezuela.\n\nTensions between Trump and Maduro culminated over the weekend, when the US staged a dramatic surprise operation to capture Maduro. American forces who raided his compound in Caracas were supported by more than 150 military aircraft.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has threatened additional action against other countries near Venezuela, including Colombia, Cuba, and Mexico.",

In a post on Truth Social, he said he's \"immediately\" taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying single-family homes.\n\n\"People live in homes, not corporations,\" Trump wrote.\n\nIt was one of two attacks the president issued on the business world. The other targeted a group familiar with crosshairs: defense contractors.\n\nTrump said he would \"not permit\" defense companies to issue dividends or do stock buybacks until they sped up production. He also criticized industry executives' \"exorbitant and unjustifiable\" compensation packages.\n\nBlackstone, a large institutional investor in residential real estate, and defense contractors Northrop Grumman and Raytheon Technologies were among the companies that saw their share prices immediately drop following the posts.\n\nFor Trump, it's in line with a new form of capitalism he's ushered in during his second term. One with more government involvement in the private sector, including taking individual stakes in companies, as BI's Emily Stewart previously covered. (You can also see my ugly mug discussing the idea here.)\n\nIt's a topic we're focusing on this year at BI with our series, \"The Future of Capitalism.\"\n\nThe intention behind Trump's latest attacks seems squarely focused on his biggest opponent these days: affordability.\n\nFrom houses to groceries to everything in between, rising prices have been a real thorn in Trump's side. The president has maintained he inherited these problems from his predecessor, but that hasn't softened the blow for some Americans.\n\nOn paper, going after institutional investors in the housing market is the perfect antidote. The real-estate market has been a mess the past few years, and frustrated home buyers love to blame Wall Street.\n\nIn reality, it's not that clear-cut, as BI's James Rodriguez has previously reported.\n\nOne analysis from October 2023 found investors with at least 1,000 units in their portfolio owned just 0.73% of all single-family homes in the US. However, regions like the southeast have a more concentrated number of institutional investors.\n\nStill, the housing shortage is more likely the reason you can't find, or afford, your dream home. Trump didn't mention anything about institutional investors having to sell the houses they already own. And even if you want to, you can't really yell at boomers to start selling theirs.",

    "fullText": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth aggressively jumped in to cut off Secretary of State Marco Rubio to yell at a reporter on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe two Cabinet members had just come out of a meeting to brief senators on the U.S. operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and explain the path forward.\n\nRubio had been taking a series of questions from reporters when he was asked about how much involvement in Venezuela would cost U.S. taxpayers before being cut off.\n\nThe secretary of state insisted it would not cost the U.S. any money and claimed the oil deal would not either.\n\n“None of these troops sit in a dry dock waiting for action,” Rubio said. “They’re deployed somewhere in the world. If they’re not here, they’re somewhere else.”\n\nHe argued that if the ships were not in the Caribbean, they would be ”somewhere else conducting activity.”\n\nHegseth had been standing by, at times smirking, as Rubio spoke, but then he stepped forward, forcing the Secretary of State to shift aside, so he could chime in.\n\n“I want to emphasize that question from CNN,” Hegseth said, glaring at the reporter Manu Raju before launching a verbal attack.\n\n“The questions never asked how much does it cost when they’re in the Mediterranean, or the Red Sea or the Indian Ocean or the Pacific, but now that they’re in our hemisphere and a counter cartel mission or ensuring an indicted individual comes to justice, now now you’re asking the question of cost,” Hegseth raged, gesturing his hand for emphasis. “It’s a disingenuous question to begin with.”\n\nBut the defense secretary did not stop there as he continued to rant at the reporter who tried to respond.\n\n“You’re trying to find any angle possible to undermine the success of one of the most historic military missions the world has ever seen,” Hegseth declared.\n\nThe defense secretary went on to claim that the operation in Venezuela was one that only the U.S. could accomplish and argued the world is “taking notice of that.”\n\nHe went on to tout the seizure of oil tankers being pursued by the U.S.\n\nWhile Rubio had been taking questions, Hegseth ignored follow-up attempts from reporters and instead spoke louder.\n\n“Our military is prepared to continue this as he said,” Hegseth said, gesturing back to Rubio. “The president when he speaks, he means it, means it. He’s not messing around. We’re an administration of action to advance our interests, and that is on full display.”\n\nHe then quickly stepped back without taking a single question as Rubio pointed out that the officials needed to go brief members of the House.\n\nHegseth ignored questions and beat a hasty retreat as questions were yelled about whether the U.S. would put boots on the ground and more.\n\nBefore the defense secretary’s rant in front of the cameras, Rubio attempted to lay out the Trump administration’s plan for Venezuela and insisted that, despite criticism, they’re not just winging it.\n\nHe outlined that stabilizing the country relied heavily on the “quarantine” as leverage and execution of a deal to take the oil out of Venezuela. He repeated the claim that the U.S. would take out 30 to 50 million barrels of oil and sell it.\n\n“That money would then be handled in such a way that we will control how it is disbursed in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people, not corruption, not the regime,” Rubio argued.\n\nThe secretary of state said the second phase would be making sure the U.S. has access to the Venezuelan market that’s “fair.” He said the third phase would be the transition. He did not provide a timeline.\n\nDemocratic senators coming out of the briefing slammed the Trump administration’s plan and warned many questions were left unanswered.\n\n“This is an insane plan. They are talking about stealing the Venezuelan oil at gunpoint for a period of time undefined as leverage to micromanage the country,” said Senator Chris Murphy. “The scope and insanity of that plan is absolutely stunning.”",

    "title": "5 unanswered questions about the 49ers ahead of the playoffs and any potential Super Bowl run",
    "description": "Answering questions about the 49ers on offense, defense, and special teams ahead of the playoffs",
    "fullText": "After a one-year hiatus, the San Francisco 49ers return to the playoffs. The regular season has been full of rollercoaster moments. The highs include thrilling victories over the Rams and Bears, while the lows feature losing two of the best players in the league at their respective positions.\n\nWe’ve learned a lot about Kyle Shanahan this year. Despite all the injuries the offense endured throughout the season, his scheme proved it can transcend the absence of star players. The 49ers were once again prolific offensively, finishing second in schedule-adjusted efficiency and third in success rate.\n\nIf the 49ers are going to make a playoff run, it’ll need to be on the backs of their offense. The defense showed some fight in Week 18, but the depth is depleted, and the margin for error no longer exists. Any drive that doesn’t result in points is a win for Robert Saleh.\n\nExpectations reset in the playoffs. What you did for 17 games doesn’t matter. It’s about which team executes for 50 minutes. With that in mind, let’s discuss five unanswered questions about the 49ers as they enter the playoffs.\n\nLooking at various numbers daily, the ones that show the most correlation with winning are passing success rate and generating explosive plays through the air. For the season, the 49ers finished third in passing success rate, at 53.1 percent. Since Week 11, the offense remained consistent, sitting third once more at 52.8 percent.\n\nThe 49ers’ offense was below league average this season in explosive play rate through the air, ranking 20th. They were much better in the final three games, ranking third, which is encouraging coming out of the bye week. Still, over the final 10 games, on a larger sample, the Niners were 20th.\n\nWeek 18 was a prime example of how difficult offense can be when you don’t generate explosives. The 49ers did it on one drive, and they quickly marched down the field and into the red zone. Outside of that drive, it was tough sledding for the offense.\n\nI’d expect Kyle Shanahan and his coaching staff to review the Week 13 matchup between the Eagles and the Chicago Bears and watch it closely, perhaps stealing some of the concepts involving motion.. Ben Johnson windrow dressed his way up and down the field, had Philadelphia’s second-level defenders confused, and found a way to control the game, despite only one explosive passing play. It’s possible, but it won’t be easy.\n\nThere are a couple of trains of thought when it comes to fourth-down decision-making. Before we share those, there is nothing more valuable in football than possessing the ball. The best chance you have to win in this league is when you have the ball.\n\nKnowing that, teams are either uber-aggressive on fourth down because they know their offense is potent and can pick up whatever yardage they need. Then there are the coaches with elite defenses. If you know your defense is stingy, then you can afford to go for it on fourth down because you understand there is a high probability that you get the ball back.\n\nIn Week 18, Shanahan punted the ball on 4th & 2 from San Francisco’s 43-yard line. In a game like that, where every possession is so valuable, the probability of you gaining two yards, retaining the ball, and going down to score was well worth being wrong about.\n\nThere was zero indication that your defense could get a stop up to that point. The Seahawks scored on their previous drive and reached 1st & goal at the 1-yard line on their first drive. The odds that you were going to prevent Seattle from getting to the 43 were slim. Sure enough, Shanahan punted.\n\nThe result worked out, as the Seahawks missed the field goal. However, that doesn’t feel like the right way to look at it. You still didn’t score, nor did the defense stop Seattle from getting to the yard where you punted.\n\nShanahan went for it on the next fourth down. The offense needed one yard. They didn’t convert. That doesn’t mean the decision to go was incorrect. On the ensuing drive, the defense had a free run at Sam Darnold. They should have ended the possession scoreless had Dee Winters sacked Darnold. They allowed a field goal, which works.\n\nHow aggressive will Shanahan be on fourth downs in the postseason? The strength of this team is on offense. Shanahan was correct more often than not during the regular season when it came time to go for it.\n\nAlmost every team is above 50% on correct decisions now.\n\nSharp contrast to a decade ago when only a couple teams would be > 50%.\n\nLook at Carroll/Vrabel! pic.twitter.com/9Q9grE5jdK\n\n— Computer Cowboy (@benbbaldwin) January 5, 2026\n\nThe 49ers are at their best when the offense is on the field. Even against a top defense like the Eagles, keeping the offense out there on fourth downs will give them the best chance to win.\n\nSaleh will put you in a position to make a play. The 49ers are short on talent defensively, but that doesn’t excuse the mental mistakes or missed tackles. The Niners had 23 missed tackles in Week 18, leading to 272 yards after contact.\n\nA.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith aren’t known for being YAC merchants, but they’re not easy to get on the ground. Neither is Dallas Goedert. Saquon Barkley had 759 yards after contact this season. The Eagles have playmakers who can make you look silly.\n\nThe 49ers’ secondary will be put in a position, time after time, in the playoffs to make a 1-on-1 tackle. Malik Mustapha has a broken+missed tackle percentage of 26 percent, which is the 18th-highest among all defensive backs in the NFL. Deommodore Lenoir sits at 22.8, and Ji’Ayir Brown is 22.2 percent.\n\nIt’s problematic when both of your safeties and the corner that you put in cloud coverage as the primary force defender are consistently missing tackles. That’s not on Saleh when his players are whiffing. He can’t tackle for them.\n\nYou can control tackling. It wouldn’t be surprising if the Niners started Eric Kendricks and Kyzir White this Sunday. Since Fred Warner went down, missed tackles at linebacker have been problematic. The Eagles’ offense has been bogged down all year. The last thing Saleh’s unit can afford to do is give them extra chances and free yards because of missed tackles.\n\nSeattle went 6-for-13 on third down, but went 0-for-3 in the red zone in Week 18. The Bears went 6-for-12 on third down, but were 1-for-3 in the red zone. The Colts were 5-for-10 on third downs and scored a touchdown on both of their red zone trips.\n\nTeams have no issues moving the ball on the 49ers’ defense. That’s been a given all season. The postseason success will come down to whether Saleh’s unit can get off the field on third downs or force field goals in the red zone.\n\nFor the season, the 49ers were 10th in opponent red zone touchdown scoring percentage at 53.7 percent and 50 percent during the final ten games. They were 21st in opponent third-down conversion rate, one spot behind the Eagles.\n\nIt comes back to possessing the ball. Your offense needs to be on the field. One way the 49ers’ defense can keep the offense in the game is by holding their opponent to three points or forcing a third-down stop before they reach field-goal range. It doesn’t have to be the majority of the time, either. A 40 percent third-down rate allowed should be plenty good.\n\nIn Week 18, Jake Moody missed a 24-yard field goal after doinking a kick off the upright. Eddy Pineiro’s one miss came at the end of the half from nearly 60 yards. Pineiro’s near-perfection will come in handy this postseason.\n\nThe 49ers’ opponent’s kicking percentage should also benefit them. Last year, teams kicking against the 49ers made 96 percent of their kicks. This season, it’s been a league-low 66.6 percent — nearly six percentage points better than the team in second place.\n\nThe 49ers finished the season ranked 13th in special teams DVOA. The Eagles were 24th. Thanks to Skyy Moore and Brian Robinson, San Francisco was fifth in kickoff returns. Flipping the field once in a playoff game would be huge for multiple reasons.\n\nSurprisingly, the Niners lead the league in hidden points on special teams. It’s something that has been dragging the team down, arguably every season under Shanahan. But this year it’s been one of the biggest strengths on a 12-win team.",

    "fullText": "Lockheed Martin plans to dramatically ramp up production of Patriot missile interceptors, aiming to more than triple its annual output to 2,000, the defense contractor said on Tuesday.\n\nLockheed said that it had reached an agreement with the US Department of Defense to \"rapidly accelerate\" the production and delivery of its PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) interceptors over a seven-year period.\n\nThe new agreement will increase the annual production capacity of PAC-3, or Patriot Advanced Capability, interceptors from roughly 600 to 2,000. These will then be delivered to US, allied, and partner forces.\n\nGlobal demand for capable air defenses and interceptors has surged in recent years in response to the large missile attacks seen in Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine and in Middle East conflicts. The American-made MIM-104 Patriot air defense system has been at the center of both.\n\nThe surface-to-air missile system has served as the backbone of Ukraine's defense against Russian missile strikes, functioning as the top layer of an air defense network largely supported by Western-made technology. And the US military has relied on the Patriot to intercept Iranian attacks.\n\nThe high expenditure rate for Patriot interceptors over the last few years has raised concerns about future stockpiles for US and allied arsenals.\n\nJim Taiclet, Lockheed's chairman and CEO, said in a statement that the defense prime \"will create unprecedented capacity for PAC-3 MSE production, delivering at the speed our nation and allies demand.\"\n\nLockheed said that it had boosted PAC-3 MSE production by more than 60% over the past two years and delivered 620 missile interceptors in 2025, a 20% increase from 2024.\n\nThe contractor supplies 17 countries with its PAC-3 interceptors. It considers the MSE variant a \"cornerstone\" of US and European missile defense.\n\nThe Pentagon said that the agreement announced on Tuesday is a result of its new Acquisition Transformation Strategy, which Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth revealed in November and calls for increased production capacity for key weapons and munitions, among other priorities.\n\nHegseth said at the time that the Pentagon would award companies bigger and longer contracts for \"proven systems\" so that they could invest \n\nThe framework agreement announced on Tuesday \"establishes the basis for negotiating a seven-year supply contract\" that will still need Congressional approval, the Pentagon said.\n\n\"This framework agreement marks a fundamental shift in how we rapidly expand munitions production and magazine depth, and how we collaborate with our industry partners,\" said Michael Duffey, the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, in a statement.",

    "fullText": "Seven US service members were injured during the covert raid to apprehend Nicolás Maduro over the weekend, a defense official told Business Insider on Tuesday, sharing the latest update on their condition.\n\nFive of the wounded troops have already returned to duty, while two others are still recovering from their injuries, the official said.\n\n\"They are receiving excellent medical care and are well on their way to recovery,\" they said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump initially revealed Saturday morning, several hours after the operation had wrapped up, that \"a couple of guys were hit\" as US forces stormed Maduro's compound to apprehend Venezuela's now-former president and his wife, Cilia Flores.\n\nTrump later shared that all the injured service members were in \"good shape.\" He added that no US troops were killed, and no equipment was lost in this operation. A helicopter took a hit but remained operational.\n\n\"The fact that this extremely complex and grueling mission was successfully executed with so few injuries is a testament to the expertise of our joint warriors,\" the defense official said.\n\nIt's unclear what kind of injuries the troops sustained during the mission or how they were hurt. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, said on Monday that nearly 200 US personnel entered \"downtown Caracas\" as part of the operation.\n\nThe surprise US operation, called Absolute Resolve, followed months of extensive planning and rehearsal, including building a replica of Maduro's compound. On Saturday, Trump described the facility as a \"highly guarded\" building, \"like a fortress.\"\n\nLow-flying helicopters brough in apprehension teams, which included law enforcement officers and special operations forces, while dozens of other aircraft — from fighter jets and bombers to drones — cleared a path for them by striking Venezuela's air defenses.\n\nDan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters on Saturday that \"those in the air over Caracas last night were willing to give their lives for those on the ground and in the helicopters.\"\n\nAmerican forces stormed the compound under heavy fire. At some point during the operation, which began late Friday night and continued for several hours into Saturday morning, the troops were wounded. The US said everyone made it out though.\n\nDozens of Venezuelan and Cuban security personnel were killed during the US raid, according to the two militaries.",

The On3 Transfer Portal Industry Rankings consider Benefield top-10 at his position.\n\nBenefield brings a wealth of experience to LSU's defense, playing over 2,000 snaps in three years at Boise State.

In his career, he's racked up 71 stops, five interceptions, two forced fumbles, 15 pressures, and three sacks.\n\nBenefield is versatile.

    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS (AP) — Nathan Chasing Horse, the former “Dances with Wolves” actor accused of sexual abuse, was temporarily thrown out of court Monday after he disrupted proceedings with demands he be allowed to fire his defense attorney a week before trial.\n\nJudge Jessica Peterson in Las Vegas ordered his jury trial to proceed next week as planned.\n\nChasing Horse has pleaded not guilty to 21 charges, including allegations that he sexually assaulted women and girls and that he filmed himself sexually abusing a girl younger than 14. Prosecutors allege he used his reputation as a spiritual leader and healer to take advantage of Native American women and girls over two decades.\n\nPeterson ordered him removed from court Monday for trying to speak over her. He argued that his attorney, Craig Mueller, did not come to visit him and did not file timely. He asked that a public defender who previously represented him be his attorney.\n\nMueller, a private defense attorney, told the court his client was ready and privately told the judge that one of his investigators had visited with Chasing Horse. He declined to comment to The Associated Press.\n\nBest known for portraying the character Smiles A Lot in the 1990 movie “Dances with Wolves,” Chasing Horse was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, which is home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.\n\nAfter starring in the Oscar-winning film, according to prosecutors, Chasing Horse began propping himself up as a self-proclaimed Lakota medicine man while traveling around North America to perform healing ceremonies. When he was arrested in 2023, he was living in a North Las Vegas house with his five wives, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe case sent shock waves across Indian Country. The original indictment was dismissed in 2024 after the Nevada Supreme Court ruled prosecutors abused the grand jury process when they provided a definition of grooming as evidence without any expert testimony. However, the court left open the possibility of charges being refiled, and a new indictment was brought later that year.\n\nProsecutors claim Chasing Horse led a cult called The Circle, and his followers believed he could speak with spirits. His victims went to him for medical help, according to a transcript from a grand jury hearing.\n\nProsecutors expect the trial to last three weeks. It is scheduled to begin Monday.",

    "description": "The Bengals' offseason seems to be setting up exactly as needed: With every possible opportunity to focus on the defense.",
    "fullText": "It's early in the NFL offseason for teams that missed the playoffs, but the Cincinnati Bengals' offseason seems to be setting up exactly as needed: With every possible opportunity to focus on the defense.\n\nThat starts with continuity on the coaching staff, and the fact that Al Golden will likely return as the team's defensive coordinator. After receiving the backing of team owner and President Mike Brown earlier in the day, head coach Zac Taylor voiced his support for Golden during a Jan. 5 news conference at Paycor Stadium and said he did not plan any staff changes.\n\nPersonnel-wise, there's plenty of business the Bengals can get done on the offensive side of the ball, including extending the contracts of players like 1,000-yard running Chase Brown. But the key offensive cogs are locked up for next year. There aren't any nagging contract situations that must be addressed, such as the past mega-deals for players like quarterback Joe Burrow and receivers Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins.\n\nMost of the other skill position players and offensive linemen are locked up contractually. And the one unsigned lineman many players would like to see return, and who has voiced interest in returning, is Dalton Risner. Risner confirmed his interest in returning to Cincinnati during a Jan. 4 interview with The Enquirer.\n\nOn the defensive side of the ball, there doesn't appear to be any lingering contract issues that would cast a pall on the offseason like Trey Hendrickson's did last year.\n\nIn short, the Bengals can pour much of their focus into the defense, which ended 2025 ranked No. 31 out of 32 teams in total defense.\n\n\"That’s the truth of it. There’s no real sugarcoating that. You got a bunch of (defensive) guys coming back,\" Taylor said. \"It’s exciting because you can focus your energy. There’s so many guys on that side of the ball that, really, their growth was accelerated over the last half of the year. You are really excited about their future here as starters (and) as role players. I feel like we are in a tremendous position going into this offseason.\n\n\"Our expectations are going to be sky high, and we are going to work like heck to meet those expectations. I think the players and coaches all see the direction we are headed. So there is a lot of positive energy heading into the offseason.\"\n\nTaylor on Jan. 5 continued to trumpet the statistical defensive improvement under Golden following Cincinnati's Nov. 9 bye week, although the team went 3-5 during that stretch and lost three one-score games. Bengals' offensive turnovers leading to opposition touchdowns also played a role in several of those games. Golden's unit didn't have much to do with those moments.\n\nTaylor also offered insight into a shorter runway for Golden to onboard with the Bengals following his run as Notre Dame's defensive coordinator for the College Football Playoff. That run ran all the way through to the National Championship game in Atlanta on Jan. 20, 2025. The Bengals then hired Golden and started to take meaningful steps in assembling the defensive coaching staff around him.\n\nThere were times it felt like the Bengals were one missed tackle or one play of some kind from winning. Instead, they more often than not let those games get away. Several players on Jan. 5 said they viewed that perspective as evidence the team is close.\n\nSimilarly, Taylor said he believed the defense was close to being where he needed it to be.\n\n\"I think that staff really worked hard to come together and get on the same page with scheme and how we're going to coach these guys,\" Taylor said. \"So, like anything, I saw great growth from that side of the ball. And they closed (by) giving up 18 points or something a game over the last eight games. And there's a lot of statistics I can read where it shows marked improvement. And so again, I like the direction that group is headed. I like the direction our team is headed. I know how it sounds when we come off the record we just had, but again, I've got a lot of excitement, and I'm excited to get back to work and get these guys ready for next year.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Zac Taylor said no Bengals' coaching staff changes are planned",

    "description": "Small drones are \"the defining threat of our time,\" Brig. Gen. Ross said, requiring a layered defense network to stop them.",
    "fullText": "The US military is racing to develop better defenses against drones, but there's no silver bullet, no wonder weapon, that will single-handedly defeat everything, the commander of the Pentagon's new counter-drone force said.\n\nJoint Interagency Task Force 401 says stopping drones isn't about one weapon or system. The counter-drone fight will require a mix of different tools, from ways to physically shoot down drones to electronic and other non-kinetic solutions.\n\nIt also demands easier, faster processes for testing and buying systems across the services.\n\nThe task force was created last fall to expedite counter-drone technologies across the Department of Defense, replacing the Joint Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office, which was established in 2019. Since its establishment, the task force has assessed and contributed to the US military's counter-drone arsenal, including forces at home and abroad.\n\nBut there's no one system they've found that can stop small uncrewed aerial systems, or UAS, which the task force's commander, Brig. Gen. Matt Ross, called \"the defining threat of our time.\"\n\n\"There's no silver bullet for counter-UAS. There's just not,\" Ross said last month at a media roundtable. \"If there was, we would already have it,\" he added.\n\nInstead, the task force is focused on a suite of technologies for layered, integrated protection from drones. \"Our formations must be able to detect, track, identify, and defeat these systems anywhere on the planet,\" Ross said. \"This requires us to layer our defenses by integrating sensors with kinetic and non-kinetic effectors and battle management systems into a responsive, interoperable network.\"\n\nHe said that many defense technologies already exist for countering medium-sized drones, which the Pentagon classifies as Group 3, but more work remains in smaller drones under Group 1 and 2, UAS such as the quadcopters that dominate in Ukraine.\n\nAnd the counter-drone problem isn't just about what systems are needed to protect service members and civilians. \"The technology is not going to solve this problem for us. We can't field a system that will stop every drone. It will all come down to the installation commander or the person responsible for that site and how they use the tools that we provide them,\" Ross said.\n\nIn its first 100 days, the task force has identified a key goal: creating a shared command-and-control system that makes it easier for different teams and regions to share data. It also wants to build a marketplace where the military services, law enforcement, and other agencies can find counter-drone systems suited to their specific threats, review performance data and user feedback, and potentially buy those systems in one place.\n\nThe task force notably isn't operating in isolation. There's overlap between the task force's focus on stopping Group 3 drones, systems like Shield AI's V-BAT or the Army's AAI RQ-7, and the responsibilities of the Golden Dome missile defense project, which has to include defenses for Group 3 drones.\n\nThe task force plans to share data with the Golden Dome project, and Ross said he's currently discussing what that looks like with Space Force's Gen. Michael Guetlein.\n\nAnother priority for the task force is helping protect against small drones at major events, including the FIFA World Cup this year, with matches set to be held at 11 large stadiums in cities across the US.\n\nRoss said that based on US forces overseas, \"we're heavily indexed against Group 3 systems, and those are larger systems that fly a longer distance and carry heavier payloads. And I want to make sure that we have just as robust protection against Group 1 and Group 2 systems that are smaller and much more likely to be seen over a widely attended gathering, stadium, or a watch party specifically for the World Cup.\"",

Mark Kelly of Arizona over the lawmaker’s participation in a video that called on troops to resist unlawful orders.\n\nHegseth said that the censure was “a necessary process step” to proceedings that could result in a demotion from Kelly's retired rank of captain in the U.S. Navy.\n\nIn a lengthy post on X, Kelly said he “never expected” what he called an “attack” from Trump and Hegseth, recounting his 25 years of Navy service, as well as combat and space missions. Calling Hegseth's move “outrageous” and “un-American,” Kelly said he would fight the censure “with everything I’ve got — not for myself, but to send a message back that Pete Hegseth and Donald Trump don’t get to decide what Americans in this country get to say about their government.”\n\nThe move comes more than a month after Kelly participated in a video with five other Democratic lawmakers in which they called on troops to defy “illegal orders.” President Donald Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition “punishable by DEATH” in a social media post days later.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York called Hegseth’s action against Kelly “a despicable act of political retribution.”\n\n“Mark Kelly is a hero and a patriot committed to serving the American people,” Schumer said on social media. “Pete Hegseth is a lap dog committed to serving one man – Donald Trump.”\n\nIn November, Kelly and the other lawmakers — all veterans of the armed services and intelligence community — called on U.S. military members to uphold the Constitution and defy “illegal orders.”\n\nThe 90-second video was first posted from Sen. Elissa Slotkin’s X account. In it, the six lawmakers — Slotkin, Kelly and Reps. Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander and Chrissy Houlahan — speak directly to U.S. service members, whom Slotkin acknowledges are “under enormous stress and pressure right now.”\n\nThe Pentagon announced that it began an investigation of Kelly late in November while citing a federal law that allows retired service members to be recalled to active duty on orders of the defense secretary for possible court martial or other measures.\n\nWhile all six lawmakers served in the military or the intelligence community, Hegseth made clear in previous remarks that Kelly was the only one facing investigation because he is the only one of the lawmakers who formally retired from the military and is still under the Pentagon’s jurisdiction.\n\nKelly said that the investigation was part of an effort to silence dissent within the military.\n\n“This is just about sending a message to retired service members, active duty service members, government employees — do not speak out against this president or there will be consequences,” Kelly told reporters in mid-December.\n\nIn his post Monday, Hegseth charged that Kelly's remarks in the video and afterward violated the Uniform Code of Military Justice provisions against conduct unbecoming an officer and violating good order and discipline.\n\nKelly, along with some of the other Democrats in the initial video, have also sent out fundraising messages based off the Republican president’s reaction to their comments, efforts that have gone toward filling their own campaign coffers and further elevating their national-level profiles.\n\nIn recent months, Kelly — whose name has frequently been mentioned as a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender — has made several trips to South Carolina, traditionally an early primary state that kicked off its party’s nominating calendar in 2024. Appearing with his wife, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, at events calling for stricter gun control measures, Kelly met during those trips with local lawmakers, stakeholders whose early support can be critical as national-level hopefuls attempt to make inroads in the critical state.\n\nHegseth said Monday that “Captain Kelly’s status as a sitting United States Senator does not exempt him from accountability, and further violations could result in further action.\"\n\nTodd Huntley, a retired Navy captain and judge advocate general, said that this is a “novel” situation that raises legal questions.\n\nOne issue, according to Huntley, is whether Kelly’s comments fall under the constitutional protections of the speech or debate clause.\n\nThe clause is intended to protect members of Congress from questioning about official legislative acts, and a 1968 Supreme Court decision wrote that the provision’s intent was “to prevent legislative intimidation by and accountability to the other branches of government.”\n\nHuntley also said that while the type of process Hegseth is using here, known as a retirement grade determination, is fairly routine, “as far as I know, they’ve always been based on conduct during the individual’s active duty service, even if it only came to light after retirement.”\n\n“So, I don’t know if conduct totally after retirement would fit the requirement for such a determination,” he added.\n\nAccording to Hegseth, Kelly now has 30 days to submit a response to the proceedings that will decide if he is demoted. The decision will be made within 45 days, Hegseth’s post added.\n\nKinnard reported from Columbia, S.C. Associated Press writer Stephen Groves contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) — President Donald Trump on Sunday told reporters that U.S. officials have determined that Ukraine did not target a residence belonging to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a drone attack last week, disputing Kremlin claims that Trump had initially greeted with deep concern.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov last week said Ukraine launched a wave of drones at Putin’s state residence in the northwestern Novgorod region that the Russian defense systems were able to defeat. Lavrov also criticized Kyiv for launching the attack at a moment of intensive negotiations to end the war.\n\nThe allegation came just a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had traveled to Florida for talks with Trump on the U.S. administration's still-evolving 20-point plan aimed at ending the war. Zelenskyy quickly denied the Kremlin allegation.\n\nTrump said that “something happened nearby” Putin's residence but that Americans officials didn't find the Russian president's residence was targeted.\n\n“I don’t believe that strike happened,\" Trump told reporters as he traveled back to Washington on Sunday after spending two weeks at his home in Florida. “We don't believe that happened, now that we've been able to check.”\n\nTrump addressed the U.S. determination after European officials argued that the Russian claim was nothing more than an effort by Moscow to undermine the peace effort.\n\nBut Trump, at least initially, had appeared to take the Russian allegations at face value. He told reporters last Monday that Putin had also raised the matter during a phone he had with the Russian leader earlier that day. And Trump said he was “very angry” about the accusation.\n\nThe U.S. president has struggled to fulfill a pledge to quickly end the war in Ukraine and has shown irritation with both Zelenskyy and Putin as he tried to mediate an end to a conflict he boasted on the campaign trail that he could end in one day.\n\nBoth Trump and Zelenskyy said last week they made progress in their talks at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nBut Putin has shown little interest in ending the war until all of Russia's objectives are met, including winning control of all Ukrainian territory in the key industrial Donbas region and imposing severe restrictions on the size of Ukraine's post-war military and the type of weaponry it can possess.\n\nMadhani reported from Washington.",

    "description": "Patria, Finland's biggest defense contractor, is scaling up production as it deals with an order backlog of over 1,000 vehicles from NATO allies.",
    "fullText": "Alarms blare over the factory floors, and work at Patria's Hämeenlinna facility grinds to a halt.\n\nThe soft thrum of an explosion echoes through the campus. Moments later, roughly 700 workers continue making their armored vehicles bound for Japan, Sweden, Slovakia, and other countries. The blast is not a test-firing of its new combat vehicle, but part of the construction for its expanding manufacturing facility.\n\nPatria, Finland's largest defense company, is planning to nearly double production at its main hub just north of Helsinki, clearing rocks with explosives on-site to make way for several new assembly lines.\n\nThe Hämeenlinna factory manufactures Patria's 8×8 armored personnel carrier and a relatively new, up-and-coming vehicle: a wheeled 6×6 troop transport that's receiving surging demand from northern and western Europe.\n\nWork on the 25-foot-long, 17-ton vehicle began in 2020 under a joint program between Finland and Latvia called the Common Armored Vehicles System. Both countries sought a cost-effective, mass-produced armored vehicle that could be used by their militaries for interoperability.\n\nLatvia has since sent at least 42 of these vehicles to Ukraine, armed with heavy machine guns and rolled out in batches over the last year. The vehicle can cross tundra and even rivers while shielding up to 10 troops it carries from land mines and artillery fire to get them to forward positions.\n\nWhen Business Insider visited Patria's factory, representatives for the company — which is majority-owned by the state of Finland — said the firm wasn't authorized to share details about the 6×6's performance in Ukraine.\n\nBut the CAVS 6×6 program has been quickly drawing attention from the rest of Europe: What began as a partnership between two countries has expanded into a consortium of seven member states.\n\nSweden joined the Common Armored Vehicles System program in 2022, followed by Germany, Denmark, the UK, and Norway in subsequent years.\n\nFinland and Latvia have placed orders for just under 500 of these vehicles, while Sweden has requested 415 of the 6×6s to be delivered over the next five years. Stockholm's latest order for 94 vehicles, announced in early December, priced each one at about $1.75 million.\n\nGermany has become the program's largest buyer, signing contracts in mid-December to acquire 876 of the 6×6 vehicles, valued at $2.3 billion. These vehicles will be split into four variants, including one that features a mortar turret.\n\nMeanwhile, Denmark, which joined the program this year, has already placed an order for 129 6×6 vehicles.\n\nThe UK and Norway are still negotiating 6×6 orders with Patria.\n\nThe CAVS 6×6 can accommodate roughly 10 troops, along with a typical crew of two or three, and features up to NATO standard level 4 armor designed to withstand direct hits from large-caliber machine gun fire, mine explosions, and nearby artillery blasts.\n\nThe CAVS 6×6 competes with other wheeled troop transports, such as Rheinmetall's Boxer and General Dynamics Land Systems' Stryker, the latter of which is extensively fielded by the US Army.\n\nThe Finnish company said it can tweak the vehicle for each customer's needs, but a typical model features climate control that enables the vehicle to operate in temperatures as low as -40°F.\n\n\"Inside, it will be comfortable enough to easily survive. We are talking about temperatures of the plus centigrades,\" Mikko Rantanen, Patria's director for 6×6 vehicle programs, told Business Insider from inside the rear compartment of one of the vehicles.\n\nThe 6×6's rear interior is spartan: Cloth-covered metal-frame seats and headrests for five people on either side, with space behind each seat for equipment and small arms.\n\nThere's just enough room for a soldier to sit with their knees touching the opposite passenger's. A few fire extinguishers inside are connected to an automatic suppression system that can detect a blaze in the rear cabin.\n\nScreens allow troops to see outside the vehicle through exterior cameras, while a rear hatch provides the option of fitting a machine gun or crewed weapon module on top of the 6×6.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the vehicle, a small passageway also lets troops pass between the rear compartment and the driver's cabin, which resembles that of a truck and features an automatic gearbox.\n\nOptional propellers on the 6×6's underside enable it to transition seamlessly from traversing land to crossing small bodies of water, such as rivers or lakes.\n\n\"We can enter the water without needing preparation in this configuration,\" said Rantanen.\n\nHowever, the 6×6's speed in the water is just under 5 mph, and Rantanen added that it's not meant to be a landing craft or amphibious assault vehicle.\n\nOn land, it's designed to drive at speeds of over 60 mph, easily cross trenches that are four feet wide, and surmount obstacles about two feet high.\n\nBuilding weapons and vehicles specifically for arctic terrain is a specialty for contractors in Finland, a country renowned for holding off the Soviet Union for over 100 days in deep snow and dense forest during World War II.\n\nPatria said that while the 6×6 can be outfitted for various terrain types, including the desert, the arctic domain is its forte.\n\nSnow isn't the only challenge in arctic warfare. Few roads are available on Finland's border with Russia — the priority threat for NATO — and its vast hinterland is peppered with thousands of small lakes and marshland that can bog down armored transport.\n\n\"In the wintertime, it's snow,\" said Petri Hepola, Patria's executive vice president for sales and marketing and its chief program officer for the F-35. \"In the summer, lots of wet soil and swampy areas. One of the most important features is how fast you can move your troops and tools through these areas.\"\n\nFinland and Norway are the only two members of Patria's 6×6 program that share Arctic borders with Russia.\n\nHowever, as northern Europe, especially the Baltic and Nordic states, grows increasingly concerned about conflict with Moscow, the Kremlin has been bolstering its military presence in the high north, repopulating key bases and transforming its Arctic fleet into a separate strategic theater.\n\nSince Finland joined NATO in 2023, alliance forces have been rushing to train on the country's terrain and frigid temperatures, making it one of the most active spots for joint exercises in recent years.\n\n\"Our products have been surviving very well in that environment,\" Hepola said.\n\nWith an order backlog of nearly 2,000 6×6 vehicles, Patria hopes its new facility in Hämeenlinna will be ready for production by 2027. The factory campus serves only the tail end of the entire manufacturing cycle, which can take weeks in most cases, or several months for more complicated variants.\n\nInside, hundreds of workers conduct welding, surface treatment, assembly, tests, and other final processes that can each take weeks to complete. Dozens of vehicles line the factory floors, and dozens more sit in parking lots, each marked with a flag to designate the country for which it has been modified.\n\nBefore delivery, each one is supposed to be driven at least 200 km, or 124 miles.\n\nRantanen, director of the 6×6 program, said Patria has been integrating counter-drone systems, such as jammers, on the vehicle.\n\nArmored vehicles in Ukraine have especially struggled against pervasive minefields and small drones with explosive payloads, some of which are controlled via a fiber optic cable connection that can't be jammed. In response, soldiers there have relied more on firearms such as shotguns and machine guns to counter such attacks.\n\nRantanen said Patria hasn't yet officially added any kinetic weapons that can take down drones.\n\n\"The drone threat is currently evolving at such a speed that it's hard to keep track of it closely,\" he said. \"But we are hard at work for the countermeasures against drones as well.\"",

Head coach Aaron Glenn will hire a new defensive coordinator. General manager Darren Mougey will also be tasked with acquiring more talented playmakers on defense. They are heavily outmatched heading into Sunday.\n\nUntil then, we've identified three potential X-factors for the Jets defense in Week 18.\n\nJermaine Johnson II hasn't recorded a sack in his latest six appearances. It's been tough sledding for the pass rusher who returned from a 2024 season-ending torn Achilles injury. Johnson continues playing with effort, so it would be nice to see him finish the season with a breakthrough.\n\nInterim defensive coordinator Chris Harris recently heaped praise on linebacker Jamien Sherwood. Sherwood leads the Jets in tackles by a longshot with 147 takedowns this season. Despite it being a lost season, he continues to compete to his full capabilities.\n\nVeteran defensive tackle Harrison Phillips has been a limited participant at practice this week. That indicates he's trending towards being available for Sunday's finale. The Jets need Phillips' run-stopping efforts against Josh Allen and James Cook.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: New York Jets vs. Buffalo Bills: 3 X-factors on defense for Week 18",

    "description": "Purdue's defense has been tight, and our expert college basketball predictions expect the Boilermakers to win tonight's Big 10 matchup by a wide margin.",
    "fullText": "No. 5 Purdue Boilermakers has revenge on its mind as it opens the new year against the Wisconsin Badgers.\n\nDespite being favored, the Boilermakers have lost their last two to Wisconsin and three straight to the Badgers ATS. In fact, Wisconsin has ATS wins in six of the last seven over Purdue as underdogs.\n\nWisconsin, meanwhile, needs an impressive win after losing to highly ranked foes in the non-conference schedule.\n\nOur Purdue vs. Wisconsin predictions and college basketball picks believe the Boilermakers will get what they want, covering on the road.\n\nPurdue vs Wisconsin best bet: Purdue -5.5 (-115)\n\nThe 12-1 Purdue Boilermakers have the most efficient offense in the nation. Since an early-December loss to Iowa State, Purdue has also stepped up its defense.\n\nAgainst the four opponents since then — a list that includes Quad I Auburn, as well as Minnesota and Marquette — Purdue has not allowed more than 60 points.\n\nThe Boilermakers held all four to fewer than .93 points per possession. After allowing teams to shoot .495 from two and .321 from three through the Iowa State game, Purdue has allowed opponents a .422 rate from two and .259 from three.\n\nAs a result, they've won all four games by between 28 and 51 points.\n\nThat means Purdue has more Quad I wins in the last four games — and as many power-conference wins — as the Wisconsin Badgers have managed all season.\n\nThe Badgers are 0-3 against Quad I foes, 0-4 if you consider that TCU was Quad I when it won by 11, only to slip to Quad II since.\n\nWisconsin failed to cover all four games and lost them all by double digits, including a 28-point loss to BYU and a 30-point defeat at Nebraska.\n\nWisconsin has been middle-of-the-road in most defensive measures, which already spells doom in the Big Ten.\n\nHowever, against elite teams, that defense slips to downright awful. The Badgers rank No. 172 in the nation, allowing foes to shoot .334 from three.\n\nTheir four top-shelf opponents shot .403. From the two-point range, Wisconsin shoots 49.6%, No. 114 in the country. Their four best foes shot .521.\n\nPurdue plays at the No. 309-ranked tempo in the nation. In their last 10 head-to-head matchups, Purdue and Wisconsin have had an Over/Under points line of 150.5 once.\n\nPurdue has gone Under in five of its last six games, including three times with an Over/Under below 153.5. Wisconsin has been under in the last two games and three of the previous four.\n\nNolan Winter has scored in double figures in six straight and averaged 18.3 in his last three. He scored 14 against BYU and 23 against Villanova, so he's not just bullying mid-major big men.\n\nFletcher Loyer is Purdue's leading scorer, but he's been a bit of a bully this season, piling on the points against low-level foes.\n\nMeanwhile, his four lowest-scoring games came against Purdue’s Quad I opponents: 7 points vs. Alabama, 10 vs. Texas Tech, 5 vs. Iowa State, and 8 vs. Auburn.\n\nFletcher Loyer Under 13.5 points\n\nSpread: Purdue -8.5 (-110) | Wisconsin +8.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Purdue -265 | Wisconsin +225\n\nOver/Under: Over 153.5 (-105) | Under 153.5 (-115)\n\nPurdue has hit the game total Under in nine of its last 12 road games.

and\n\n(b)  Provisions of law, other than section 721 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), do not, in my judgment, provide adequate and appropriate authority for me to protect the national security in this matter.\n\nSec. 2.  Actions Ordered and Authorized.  On the basis of the findings set forth in section 1 of this order, considering the factors described in subsection (f) of section 721, as appropriate, and pursuant to my authority under applicable law, including section 721, I hereby order that:\n\n(a)  The Transaction is hereby prohibited, and ownership by HieFo of any interest or rights in any of the Emcore Assets, whether effected directly or indirectly through HieFo, or through HieFo’s partners, subsidiaries, affiliates, or foreign person shareholders (collectively, Affiliates), is also prohibited.  For the purposes of sections 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c) of this order, the United States nationals on HieFo’s Board of Directors as of November 26, 2025, are not considered Affiliates of HieFo.\n\n(b)  To effectuate this order, not later than 180 calendar days after the date of this order, unless such date is extended by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), HieFo shall, and shall ensure that its Affiliates, divest all interests and rights in the Emcore Assets, wherever located, including contracts, inventory, tangible property, parts, fixed assets, accounts receivable, permits, real property leased or owned by EMCORE Corporation, and intellectual property.  All actions by CFIUS referenced in this order may be conducted by the agencies designated by its Staff Chairperson and all obligations on HieFo or EMCORE Corporation are subject to any extensions of time, conditions, or exceptions as such CFIUS agencies determine are appropriate and will not impair the national security of the United States.\n\n(d)  Until the Divestment has been completed and verified to the satisfaction of CFIUS and CFIUS has communicated in writing to HieFo that the Divestment is complete, unless otherwise approved in writing by CFIUS, HieFo shall not, and shall ensure that its Affiliates do not, dissolve, reorganize, or transfer any interest or rights in any of the Emcore Assets, or otherwise change its or their legal structure or relocate, transfer, or sell any physical, intangible, or financial assets in a manner that would materially impede or prevent HieFo or its Affiliates from complying with this order as determined by CFIUS.\n\n(e)  At any time prior to or upon CFIUS communicating in writing to HieFo that the Divestment is complete, CFIUS is authorized to require auditing of HieFo, at no expense to CFIUS, on terms it deems appropriate in order to ensure compliance with this order and any conditions imposed by CFIUS.\n\n(f)  Immediately upon Divestment:\n\n(i)   HieFo shall certify in writing to CFIUS that all steps necessary to fully and permanently effectuate the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, including any conditions imposed by CFIUS pursuant to subsections (b) and (l) of this section, have been completed in accordance with this order; and\n\n(ii)  HieFo shall certify in writing to CFIUS that, as part of the Divestment, HieFo and its Affiliates have destroyed or transferred all intellectual property associated with the Emcore Assets in their possession or control, including copies thereof, that HieFo and its Affiliates are required to divest pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.  CFIUS is authorized to require auditing of HieFo and its Affiliates, at no expense to CFIUS, on terms CFIUS deems appropriate in order to ensure that such destruction or transfer of intellectual property is complete.\n\n(g)  HieFo shall not, and shall ensure that its Affiliates do not, complete a sale or transfer under this order to any third party:\n\n(i)   until HieFo notifies CFIUS in writing of the intended buyer or transferee; and\n\n(ii)  unless 30 calendar days have passed from the notification in subsection (g)(i) of this section and CFIUS has not issued an objection to HieFo.  Among the factors CFIUS may consider in reviewing the proposed sale or transfer are whether the buyer or transferee is a United States citizen or is owned by United States citizens; has or has had a direct or indirect contractual, financial, familial, employment, or other close and continuous relationship with HieFo or its Affiliates, or officers or employees of HieFo or its Affiliates; and can demonstrate a willingness and ability to support compliance with this order and any conditions imposed by CFIUS.  In addition, CFIUS may consider whether the proposed sale or transfer would threaten to impair the national security of the United States or undermine the purpose of this order, and whether the sale effectuates, to CFIUS’s satisfaction and in its discretion, the Divestment.\n\n(h)  From the date of this order until HieFo provides a certification of the Divestment to CFIUS pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, HieFo shall certify to CFIUS on a weekly basis that it and its Affiliates are in compliance with this order and any conditions imposed by CFIUS and shall include a description of efforts to effectuate the Divestment and a timeline for projected completion of remaining actions.\n\n(i)  Any transaction or other instrument entered into or method employed for the purpose of, or with the effect of, evading or circumventing this order is prohibited.\n\n(j)  Without limitation on the exercise of authority by any agency under other provisions of law, CFIUS is authorized to implement measures it deems necessary and appropriate to verify and enforce compliance with this order and any conditions imposed by CFIUS.  For purposes of verifying and enforcing compliance with this order and any conditions imposed by CFIUS, HieFo shall permit employees of the United States Government as designated by CFIUS access, on reasonable notice to HieFo, to all premises and facilities of HieFo and its Affiliates located in the United States, including those of the Emcore Assets:\n\n(i)    to inspect and copy any books, ledgers, accounts, correspondence, memoranda, and other records and documents in the possession or under the control of HieFo or its Affiliates that concern any matter relating to this order;\n\n(ii)   to inspect or audit any information systems, networks, hardware, software, data, records, communications, or property in the possession or under the control of HieFo or its Affiliates that concern any matter relating to this order;

    "description": "President Donald Trump, 79, fired off an early-morning tirade Friday insisting he is in “PERFECT HEALTH” as concerns grow over his apparent mental and physical decline. “The White House Doctors have just reported that I am in ‘PERFECT HEALTH,’ and that I ‘ACED’ (Meaning, was correct on 100% of the questions asked!), for the third straight time, my Cognitive Examination, something which no other President, or previous Vice President, was willing to take,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “P.S.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump, 79, fired off an early-morning tirade Friday insisting he is in “PERFECT HEALTH” as concerns grow over his apparent mental and physical decline.\n\n“The White House Doctors have just reported that I am in ‘PERFECT HEALTH,’ and that I ‘ACED’ (Meaning, was correct on 100% of the questions asked!), for the third straight time, my Cognitive Examination, something which no other President, or previous Vice President, was willing to take,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n“P.S., I strongly believe that anyone running for President, or Vice President, should be mandatorily forced to take a strong, meaningful, and proven Cognitive Examination. Our great Country cannot be run by ‘STUPID’ or INCOMPETENT PEOPLE!”\n\nTrump has routinely brushed aside suggestions he is in mental decline by boasting about passing the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, a test used to detect cognitive impairment or early signs of dementia. The test involves tasks such as drawing a clock to show a specific time and identifying animals.\n\nDuring a December 2025 speech in North Carolina, Trump also proudly told the crowd how he “aced” such a test.\n\n“The first question is like, ‘What is this?’ And they show a lion, a giraffe, a fish, and a hippopotamus. And they say, ‘Which is the giraffe?’” Trump said.\n\n“I don’t think Joe [Biden] would have gotten the first question right,” he added. “He would say hippo. ‘I want the hippo,’”\n\nThe Daily Beast has been leading the way in reporting on concerns about the president’s health, including frequently documenting how Trump covers large bruises on his hands with makeup and tries to conceal his swollen cankles whenever possible.\n\nIn a remarkably candid interview with The Wall Street Journal published Jan. 1, Trump—the oldest sitting president in U.S. history—was forced to address his health issues and, in doing so, he contradicted previous assurances given to the public.\n\nHe revealed that his second medical exam last year at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center involved a CT scan, not an MRI as previously disclosed. Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, Trump’s physician who conducted the exam, told the Journal that the CT scan was performed to “definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues.”\n\nThe White House confirmed in July 2025 that Trump had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a condition that causes swelling in the lower legs.\n\nTrump told the Journal that he briefly wore compression socks to help with his cankles but stopped because he did not like them. The president also made the startling admission that he takes more aspirin than his doctors recommend for “cardiac prevention.”\n\n“They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don’t want thick blood pouring through my heart,” Trump said. “I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart. Does that make sense?”\n\nTrump blamed the frequent bruising on his hands—which he desperately attempts to conceal with concealer—on his heavy daily aspirin use.\n\nFor months, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has offered a boilerplate response when the Daily Beast asked about the bruises, insisting they are the result of the president “meeting more Americans and shaking their hands on a daily basis than any other president in history.”\n\nTrump also admitted he is so fragile that his hand bled after Attorney General Pam Bondi nicked him with her ring during a high five at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July 2024.\n\n“The ring hit the back of my hand, and, yes, there was a slight little cut,” Trump told the Journal of the incident, which reportedly caused alarm among members of his inner circle.\n\nTrump said he applies makeup to his hands whenever he gets “whacked again.”\n\n“I have makeup that’s, you know, easy to put on. Takes about 10 seconds,” he said.",

Mora will be the third CSU head coach Summers has been defensive coordinator for.\n\nSummers was hired by Jay Norvell ahead of the 2025 season and then took over as CSU interim coach when Norvell was fired in October. Summers also served as CSU's defensive coordinator in 2015 under Mike Bobo.\n\nThe Rams finished 2025 second-to-last in the Mountain West in scoring defense (30.8 points per game allowed) and last in total defense (426 yards per game allowed) as the injury-ravaged unit struggled.\n\nHe came back to CSU after three seasons as Western Kentucky’s defensive coordinator, where the Hilltoppers were one of the top teams in forcing turnovers.\n\nWestern Kentucky ranked ninth nationally in pass defense in 2024. During the 2022 and 2023 seasons, the Hilltoppers led the nation in defensive touchdowns, scoring nine times.\n\nKrantz spent the last three seasons at Liberty, where he at times held roles both as special teams and defensive coordinator. Liberty led the nation with 21 interceptions in 2023 and frequently ranked near the top in the nation in turnovers forced.\n\nKrantz is a Northern Colorado graduate. He was Washington State's special teams coordinator in 2021 and has also worked at Missouri (2022), South Carolina (2016-20), Auburn (2015), Florida (2013-14), Kentucky (2011-12) and Northern Colorado (2009-10).\n\nMcClendon spent the last four seasons as the defensive line coach at UConn under Mora.\n\nPrior to UConn, he was at Youngstown State (2020-21).

Prior to UConn, he worked at Arkansas State (2021), Tennessee Martin (2019-20) and UCLA.\n\nDiabate joins Mora from UConn, where he served in the same role for the last four seasons (2022-25). Diabate has also coached at Middle Tennessee State (2017-21), Notre Dame (2017), Colgate (2015-17) and Syracuse (2013-15).\n\nHe played linebacker at Syracuse prior to his coaching career.\n\nAh You is retained by Mora after serving on Norvell's staff in 2025. Prior to CSU, he spent four seasons at Weber State coaching linebackers. The former BYU linebacker has also coached at BYU (2018-19), Oregon State (2017) and Utah State (2016).\n\nMatthews played for Colorado State as a safety from 2011-15 and earned All-Mountain West honors twice. He finished his career in the top-10 in school history in interceptions and games played and started.\n\nHe returned to CSU on Norvell's staff in 2025 and was retained by Mora. He's also worked at Colorado Mesa (2022-24) and Northern Colorado (2019) as well as in the high school ranks.\n\nBrown served in the same role he will hold at CSU for the last two seasons under Mora at UConn.\n\nPrior to UConn, he held the same role at Mississippi State from 2020-23 and Washington State before that from 2018-20.\n\nHe played defensive back at Sioux Falls, helping his team win two NAIA national championships. Brown has also worked at Elon, South Florida, Washington, Baylor and with the Houston Texans.\n\nBosnos is retained by Mora in the same role he served in 2025 and Bosnos has been with the Rams since 2022 in a variety of roles.\n\nPrior to CSU, Bosnos was on Norvell's recruiting and personnel staff at Nevada (2018-21).\n\nCollins is retained by Mora in the same role he served in 2025 after being hired as CSU's first football GM. Collins oversees the recruiting efforts and roster personnel for the CSU football program.\n\nPrior to CSU, Collins worked at Ole Miss (2020-24) where he was in player personnel and recruiting.

    "fullText": "The Pittsburgh Steelers’ defense has slipped this season in its second year under Teryl Austin as age and injuries have caught up to the unit, but one player who hasn’t is Joey Porter Jr.\n\nPorter has stepped up in his third season, picking up the slack and setting career highs in several categories after struggling last year. He has personal bests in passes defended and sacks despite playing the fewest games of his career thus far.\n\nHe’s also done a great job of keeping opponents out of the end zone. He hasn’t allowed a touchdown on his last 1,011 coverage snaps — the longest active streak in the NFL.\n\nJoey Porter Jr has not allowed a TD in his last 1,011 coverage snaps\n\nThe longest active streak in the NFL\n\nThe 25-year-old has emerged as one of the league’s better cornerbacks and is making a strong case for a contract extension from the Steelers, who desperately need to get younger and faster on defense. Porter, whose father starred for Pittsburgh two decades ago, fits the bill.\n\nThe Steelers already have the most expensive defense in the NFL, but Porter deserves a raise and would be worth the investment. He should still have several good years in front of him and will be eligible for a contract extension this offseason.\n\nPorter is one of several extension candidates this offseason for Pittsburgh, although the front office may opt to invest \n\nMore Steelers: Can Steelers’ Surging Defense Stop Ravens’ Elite Run Offense?\n\nThe post Steelers Defender Making Strong Case For Contract Extension With Mind-Blowing Streak appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "description": "Can Jordan Magee replace Bobby Wagner in the middle of the Commanders' defense in 2026? That's a key offseason question.",
    "fullText": "The Washington Commanders have plenty of holes to fill this upcoming offseason. While Washington needs to add another starting receiver, perhaps a tight end, and a running back, the Commanders have their quarterback and an offensive line to build around.\n\nIt's another story on defense. Washington needs plenty of help. Fortunately, the Commanders have the cap space to be active in free agency and a top-seven pick in the 2026 NFL draft to help improve the defense.\n\nOne question GM Adam Peters and head coach Dan Quinn must resolve before the offseason begins is how many young defenders can step into a starting role next season? One name comes to mind: linebacker Jordan Magee.\n\nThe second-year linebacker from Temple has seen increased snaps on defense this season. Magee has played in every game for Washington this season, making seven starts. With the Commanders using Frankie Luvu more as a pass rusher, Magee has played alongside Bobby Wagner at linebacker. Magee has flashed numerous times in 2025, as his speed is something Washington lacks on defense.\n\nWhen the Commanders selected Magee in the 2024 NFL draft, they reportedly liked him as the heir apparent to the future Hall of Famer Wagner. Unfortunately, Magee hasn't had any snaps at Mike linebacker to see if he could handle that role full-time in 2026.\n\nHead coach Dan Quinn was asked about Magee is ready for that responsibility.\n\nThe part that you want to do is like, how do you train somebody into that space?\" Quinn said this week. \"And some of it is, in practice, you have a number of them that can have it on, so they're hearing my communication. So, what we would never want is on the first time you heard it, like, 'Oh, that's what Dan sounds like, or that's what it sounds like.' And so, you go through that process in the practice. So, when he takes his reps in the practice, when if he was with the second or the third group, it's the same exact process that I would do with Wags, 'Hey, this down in distance, remind this player alert for this.' So, there's a little bit of directing that comes of it.\"\n\nWith Washington long out of contention, fans have wanted to see Magee replace Wagner. That's not the right decision. Wagner remains one of the Commanders' top defensive players, despite his struggles in coverage. The ideal scenario would be limiting his snaps. It would not only help keep Wagner fresh, but also give the staff an evaluation of how Magee handles playing inside.\n\nQuinn offered even more details on Magee playing inside.\n\n\"Think if you were a quarterback in the huddle and you want to give one more reminder before you broke out to somebody, you would tell them that that's sometimes what I'm telling that person to do into that spot and then going in, you want to find out did they do it in college and signals and now it'll be different I suppose because that's been an additional thing that they're doing that we haven't done before,\" he said. \"But just the leading part of it, I think that's the big thing, the vocal part of it. Doesn't mean you have to be loud and rah rah, but you have to be somebody that can take command, that can give information quickly. And not all linebackers can do that.\"\n\nThat's a thorough answer. Was Quinn telling us something about Magee without actually saying it? It's clear he likes him. The Commanders see Magee as a part of their future, but that doesn't necessarily mean playing inside.\n\nWagner is 35 and a free agent at season's end. With so many holes to fix on defense, don't count on the Commanders handing the position to Magee full-time in 2026 without knowing if he's ready for it. Whose fault is that?\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Can Jordan Magee replace Bobby Wagner in 2026?",

    "fullText": "TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te on Thursday vowed to defend the self-ruled island’s sovereignty in the face of China’s “expansionist ambitions,” days after Beijing wrapped up live-fire military drills near its shores.\n\n“In the face of China’s rising expansionist ambitions, the international community is watching to see whether the Taiwanese people have the resolve to defend themselves,” Lai said in his New Year’s address.\n\n“As president, my stance has always been clear: to firmly safeguard national sovereignty, strengthen national defense and the resilience of the whole society, and comprehensively construct an effective deterrence and democratic defense mechanism,” he added.\n\nLai’s comments came days after China wrapped up live-fire drills around Taiwan featuring rocket launches, aircraft and warships. Beijing had expressed anger at a planned U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, as well as at Japan’s new leader’s comments that Tokyo could intervene in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan.\n\nChina sees Taiwan as its own territory and threatens to annex it by force if necessary. A former Japanese colony, Taiwan has been governed independently from the mainland since 1949, when the Nationalist Party lost a civil war against the Chinese Communist Party and retreated to the island.\n\nLai's speech was met angrily in Beijing, where a spokesperson for the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office called the president “a saboteur of peace, a troublemaker and a warmonger,” according to the official Xinhua news agency.\n\n“No matter what Lai and the Democratic Progressive Party authorities say or do, they cannot change the fact that Taiwan is part of China,\" said spokesperson Chen Binhua.\n\nThe planned arms sale, valued at more than $11 billion, is the U.S.’s largest so far to Taiwan. It includes missiles, drones, artillery systems and military software.\n\nThe United States is obligated by its own laws to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.\n\nChina’s leader Xi Jinping called Taiwan’s eventual annexation “ unstoppable \" during his own televised New Year’s address on Wednesday.\n\nTaiwan last year announced a special $40 billion budget for arms purchases, including to build an air defense system with high-level detection and interception capabilities called the Taiwan Dome.\n\nThe budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033, and comes after Lai already pledged to raise defense spending to 5% of the island’s GDP, as part of his strategy amid China’s threats of invasion.\n\n“Facing China’s serious military ambitions, Taiwan has no time to wait,” Lai said.\n\nMistreanu reported from Beijing.",

    "fullText": "While many of the headlines lately seem to be about players making the decisions to explore their options in the transfer portal, Penn State and new head coach Matt Campbell got a bit of big news from one of the top defensive players on the roster. Linebacker Tony Rojas announced he will be staying in Happy Valley in 2026.\n\nRojas shared his announcement to return wiht a post on his Instagram account on Thursday, putting an end to any speculation that he may explore some transfer opportunities this offseason.\n\n\"The past three seasons have been an incredible ride with a lot of historic moments and lifetime memories I will be able to hold on to,\" Rojas said in his statement. \"But as we all know, this season has been nothing but a roller coaster and I was in disbelief and hurt when I went down. I felt like I let myself down and most importantly my teammates down.\n\n\"With that being said, after lots of talks with my family and close ones, I will be returning to Penn State for my senior year,\" Rojas confirmed. \"I'm ready to finish what me and my teammates started and am ready to flip this thing and tell an incredible story with Coach Campbell and his new staff.\"\n\nRojas was one of the rising stars on the defense since his arrival with the program but he suffered what turned out to be a season-ending injury during the 2025 season. His loss from the roster fell in line with the rapid decline of Penn State's season with UCLA being the first team to take full advantage of a Rojas-less Penn State defense. Penn State went on to lose the next four games after that UCLA loss (Northwestern, Iowa, Ohio State, and Indiana) as the defense worked to fix some concerns it had.\n\nPenn State does have a few linebackers choosing to enter the transfer portal, likely resulting in their pending departure from the program. Karui Jackson, Keon Wylie, and Anthony Speca have all reportedly entered the transfer portal.\n\nFollow Kevin McGuire on Threads, Bluesky, Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook.\n\nFollow Nittany Lions Wire on X, Facebook, and Threads.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nittany Lions Wire: Penn State LB Tony Rojas announces decision for 2026",

    "fullText": "PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — Fernando Mendoza threw three touchdown passes, Indiana’s defense thoroughly throttled Alabama, and the top-seeded Hoosiers roared into the College Football Playoff semifinals with a 38-3 victory in the 112th Rose Bowl on Thursday.\n\nMendoza passed for 192 yards in his first game since winning his school’s first Heisman Trophy, but the hard-nosed Hoosiers (14-0, No. 1 CFP seed) won the Rose Bowl for the first time in school history by dominating the Crimson Tide (11-4, No. 9 CFP seed) at the line of scrimmage.\n\nIndiana scored the game’s first 24 points before pouring it on with fourth-quarter rushing TDs from Kaelon Black and Roman Hemby, wrapping up a jubilant win in the 112th edition of the Granddaddy of Them All.\n\nCharlie Becker, Omar Cooper Jr. and Elijah Sarratt caught TD passes, while Black rushed for 99 yards. Indiana outgained Alabama 407-193, steadily delighting a decidedly pro-Indiana crowd that celebrated its long-struggling team’s first Rose Bowl game appearance since 1968 with chants of “Hoosier Daddy?” in the final minutes.\n\nIndiana had not won any bowl game since the Copper Bowl in 1991, but history has been no match for Curt Cignetti and his dominant Hoosiers during the coach’s two transcendent seasons.\n\nThe Hoosiers are headed to the Peach Bowl on Jan. 9 for a CFP semifinal rematch with fifth-seeded Oregon, which routed Texas Tech 23-0 earlier Thursday in the Orange Bowl. Indiana beat the then-No. 3 Ducks 30-20 in Eugene last October in one of Cignetti’s most impressive Big Ten victories.\n\nIndiana is two wins away from the first national championship in school history after becoming the first team to advance following a first-round bye in the current 12-team playoff format. The first six bye teams — including the first two this season — couldn’t come back strong from an extra-long layoff, but the Hoosiers took care of business while improving to 25-2 under Cignetti.\n\nThe Crimson Tide’s second season under Kalen DeBoer ended in the same venue as their final season under Nick Saban two years ago. Alabama was outclassed one week after an impressive road win over Oklahoma, managing just 151 yards before the meaningless final minutes of this blowout.\n\nTy Simpson passed for 67 yards before backup Austin Mack replaced him in the third quarter. Mack immediately got the Tide rolling on a 65-yard drive leading to a short field goal, but the Hoosiers responded with two unstoppable TD drives.\n\nIndiana dominated the famous Rose Bowl turf, which stayed pristine despite nearly 24 hours of steady rain before kickoff. The storms dissipated while the Hoosiers took their first-half lead, and blue skies appeared in the second half.\n\nAfter the first scoreless first quarter in a Rose Bowl in 26 years, Indiana’s second drive stretched 84 yards and 16 plays over nearly nine minutes before Nicolas Radicic’s 31-yard field goal on the first snap of the second quarter.\n\nIndiana’s defense then stopped Alabama on fourth and 1 at the Tide 34, and Mendoza fired a long, high pass to the leaping Becker four plays later for a 21-yard touchdown.\n\nSimpson fumbled in Indiana territory after a courageous first-down scramble late in the first half, and the Hoosiers methodically drove for Mendoza’s 1-yard TD pass with 17 seconds left to Cooper, the hero of Indiana’s dramatic victory over Penn State.\n\nAfter halftime, Mendoza led a steady 79-yard drive ending in his 24-yard TD pass to the leaping Sarratt.\n\nThe victory is the latest step in the monumental two-season turnaround of what was the losingest program in college football when Cignetti took charge. After winning 11 games and reaching the CFP last season, the Hoosiers steamrolled through their schedule this fall before beating defending national champion Ohio State for the Big Ten title and ascending to the No. 1 spot in the AP Top 25 for the first time.\n\nAlabama: It was remarkable to see the most successful program of the 21st century get dominated up front. The Tide’s inability to run the ball was a season-long problem, but it was particularly painful in Pasadena. Whether through personnel or scheme, DeBoer’s offense must take a step forward next year to reach the standard expected at Bama.\n\nIndiana: The Hoosiers acted like they’ve been here before, even though they haven’t. Cignetti’s group has a businesslike demeanor that wasn’t remotely altered by Alabama’s reputation and history.\n\nAlabama: Host East Carolina on Sept. 5.\n\nIndiana: A trip to Atlanta to face the powerhouse Ducks, who lost last season’s Rose Bowl to Ohio State as the No. 1 seed.",

    "fullText": "A general practitioner in the UK has been suspended for five months after booking in two fictitious appointments at the end of her workday to avoid being late to pick up her children.\n\nDr Helen Eisenhauer, 43, was working at the Stenhouse Medical Centre in Arnold, England, when she scheduled the bogus appointments on an afternoon in 2024.\n\nAt a recent tribunal hearing, the mom said she was “thoroughly ashamed” of her behavior and admitted she struggled to balance her personal and professional duties, per The Times of London.\n\n“The incident occurred at a time of particular stress for me when I was having to balance the demands of my young family with busy professional commitments,” Eisenhauer declared. “I fully accept, however, that this does not excuse my dishonesty.”\n\nThe harsh penalty has sparked heated debate in the UK, where there is a significant shortage of doctors.\n\nMore than one-fifth of Brits who booked an appointment to see a general practitioner in November had to wait at least two weeks, per The Times. 7.5% of patients waited a month or more.\n\nIt’s estimated Eisenhauer earns around £60,000 (USD $80,000) per year, although she works part-time, The Times reports.\n\nEisenhauer said she was suffering from sleep deprivation at the time she added the two fake appointments to her diary.\n\nThe busy mom admitted she failed to make proper childcare arrangements for the day and needed to pick up her children by 6 p.m. She feared seeing two more patients would mean she wouldn’t leave the practice until after that time.\n\nA partner at the medical practice, where Eisenhauer has worked since 2018, noticed anomalies in her schedule and confronted her at a meeting.\n\nEisenhauer subsequently reported herself to the UK’s General Medical Council.\n\n“I am thoroughly ashamed and determined never to compromise the medical profession or myself again,” the doctor stated at the recent tribunal hearing.\n\nDespite her contrition, she was slapped with the five-month ban.\n\n“Dr Eisenhauer displayed a reckless disregard for patient safety and professional standards,” tribunal chairman Neil Dalton declared.\n\nHowever, many moms are rallying around Eisenhauer and saying her situation proves reforms are needed for working parents.\n\n“It’s sad that our system pushes vital workers to these extremes,” one supporter stated on\n\n“Anyone who has raced from work with their heart racing to avoid being late for nursery or after school pick up will have enormous sympathy for this lady,” another parent posited.\n\n“I think the real problem here is not that she did it, but she had to do it,” a third declared.",

    "description": "The coach said \"we have the personnel\" to be great, and reaching that level will fall on a new defensive coordinator, USC's third in five seasons.",
    "fullText": "Two years ago, a day after he decided to fire Alex Grinch as USC's defensive coordinator, Lincoln Riley made a promise to those concerned about the future of the Trojans' defense.\n\n“I have complete belief, conviction. We will play great defense here,” the coach said in November 2023. “It is going to happen. There's not a reason in the world why it can’t.”\n\nTwo years later, another defensive coordinator is out the door at USC. The day after Grinch’s replacement, D’Anton Lynn, left to take the same job at Penn State, Riley stood in front of reporters, assuring everyone once again that soon enough, USC would be great on that side of the ball.\n\n“The arrow,” he said Tuesday, “is pointing straight up.”\n\n“The opportunity for us to make a hire, to continue to make us better and to go from being a very good defense to being a great defense is the goal.”\n\nYet patience on that promise is wearing thin, especially given how the season had ended less than an hour before. USC blew a 10-point lead in the final five minutes against Texas Christian on Tuesday, a team playing without its star quarterback, before missing four tackles on a third-and-20 walk-off touchdown in overtime. The disastrous Alamo Bowl defeat would serve as an especially sobering reminder that while USC made progress under Lynn, it’s still a ways from heeding Riley’s guarantee.\n\nAnd now, the defense will have to start again, with a new direction, a new scheme and a new coordinator, who will be Riley’s third hire in five seasons at USC.\n\nIn spite of all that, Riley was upbeat when asked about the unit’s future Tuesday night. He felt “fantastic,” he said, about where USC’s defense was headed.\n\n“We have the personnel,” Riley said of becoming a great defensive unit. “We're on an upward trend. And, you know, there's going to be a lot of interest in this job. I mean, this will be an extremely, extremely coveted job, and I can already tell by the nature of what my phone's been like the last couple of days.”\n\nSeveral potential candidates with deep experience, as well as close ties to USC athletics officials, are expected to be available.\n\nFormer Texas defensive coordinator Pete Kwiatkowski, who worked at Washington under current USC athletic director Jennifer Cohen, was let go by the Longhorns earlier this month. Cincinnati Bengals defensive coordinator Al Golden, meanwhile, worked closely with USC general manager Chad Bowden at Notre Dame and could be looking for a job as soon as next week.\n\nBoth coached college defenses that ranked in the top four in the nation in points allowed during the 2024 season.\n\nUSC appeared bound for a similar trajectory after Year 1 with Lynn. The Trojans allowed 10 fewer points per game, leaping from 121st in scoring defense under Grinch to 56th in his first season at USC. They got stingier on third down — 106th nationally to 21st — and in the red zone — 119th to 69th. Lynn was even named candidate for the Broyles Award, given to the nation’s top assistant.\n\nIn some respects, USC’s defense continued to take steps forward in Year 2 under Lynn. It gave up fewer points and fewer yards per game. The pass rush improved, adding 10 sacks to its season total in 2025.\n\nBut the personnel on defense was less proven this season — and more prone to mistakes. The secondary struggled through stretches. A thin group of linebackers was often overwhelmed. The defensive interior was manhandled for most of the season, and in each of their three regular-season losses, the Trojans were trampled on the ground.\n\nLast month, when asked about the group’s inconsistency, Lynn said that USC’s youth forced him to “scale back” significantly on defense. He actually wondered, in the wake of USC’s loss to Oregon, if he shouldn’t have scaled back the defense even more this season.\n\n“It’s different when you’re teaching an 18-year-old versus teaching a guy who has been at two to three schools who has already played a bunch of college ball,” Lynn said.\n\nLynn, nonetheless, leaves USC in a better place than when he arrived. The nation’s No. 1 recruiting class lands on campus next week, with plenty of highly ranked reinforcements on the way. Talented freshmen like defensive linemen Jahkeem Stewart and Floyd Boucard as well as defensive back Alex Graham are rising stars who should be ready to step into significant roles.\n\nBut USC will have to replace three starters in the secondary, including Kamari Ramsey, its best linebacker [Eric Gentry] and its top run stopper on the defensive line [Anthony Lucas]. Whomever takes over as coordinator will be expected to take a significant step forward immediately, up against one of the nation’s toughest schedules in what should be a decisive season for the program.\n\nThen there’s the matter of Riley’s job security, which could make any available top coordinator queasy.\n\nYet as far as the coach is concerned, the path to finding a great coordinator and fielding a great defense isn’t that far off from what USC has now.\n\n“I definitely don't want to press reset,” Riley said. “I'm excited about the process, and I think it's going to make us better, I know it will. So, we'll wake up tomorrow morning and we'll get on it.”\n\n In your inbox every Monday morning.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "A New York Times deep dive alleges that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth donned makeup for a February meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart.",
    "fullText": "United States Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addresses a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2025 \n\nA New York Times deep dive alleges that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth donned makeup for a February meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart during which he seemed much more concerned with his appearance than policy.\n\nThe Times published a comprehensive story about the Trump administration’s handling of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on Tuesday in which it suggested that Hegseth began his tenure at the Pentagon “as something of a blank slate on the war.”\n\n“He didn’t have any of his own thoughts on Russia and Ukraine,” an ex-Pentagon official told the Gray Lady. “But he had civilian advisers who did.”\n\nOn Day 4, the freshly minted defense secretary sat at a Pentagon conference table as one of his coterie of advisers argued for an immediate U-turn.\n\nThe ideological godfather of the group was Elbridge A. Colby, grandson of the Nixon-era C.I.A. director William E. Colby. The younger Mr. Colby and Mr. Vance had been introduced in 2015 by an editor at National Review who thought they were like-minded. Nearly nine years later, as Mr. Biden poured billions of dollars into arming Ukraine, Mr. Colby argued that “we would have been better served to put a lot more of that money to use in the Pacific.”\n\nNow, it was one of his disciples, Dan Caldwell, presenting the group’s recommendations to Mr. Hegseth, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other military leaders.\n\nThe Pentagon, Mr. Caldwell argued, should pause delivery of certain munitions that the Biden administration had promised to Ukraine, because, he believed, existing stocks were insufficient to execute America’s war plans around the world. Nor should it use the additional $3.8 billion left unspent by the Biden administration to buy weapons for Ukraine.\n\nGeneral Brown did not speak as Mr. Caldwell wrapped up. He simply shifted uncomfortably in his chair.\n\nDuring a trip to Europe the next month, Hegseth reportedly made sure to powder his nose for the cameras, but declined to answer Ukrainian defense minister Rustem Umerov’s queries:\n\nThe Ukrainians had repeatedly requested a proper sit-down. Instead it would be a brief stand-up affair in an anteroom.\n\nBeforehand, according to an American official present, Mr. Hegseth dabbed his nose with powder from a small compact. “Look commanding,” he told one aide. The handshake with the Ukrainian might be shown on Fox; the president might be watching.\n\nThen the standing meeting began, Mr. Umerov coming in close, taking his voice down to a whisper, assuring the secretary that he knew America’s political and security agenda might be changing. He didn’t ask for new aid. He just needed to know one thing: Would the U.S. military continue to supply the munitions Ukraine was counting on, the ones approved by Mr. Biden? Every delivery sustained the lives of Ukrainian soldiers on the front lines; every delivery that didn’t arrive one day meant those soldiers would die the next.\n\nAgain and again, Mr. Umerov repeated his plea: “I just need you to be honest with me. Just be honest with me.”\n\nHegseth allegedly offered Umerov only nodding.\n\n“He wasn’t pleading for the answer that he wanted, but just for honesty, some indication,” observed one U.S. official. “He was saying: You can trust me; you can trust us. Just tell me what you guys are thinking.”\n\nThe post New York Times Deep Dive Alleges Pete Hegseth Donned Makeup for Ukraine Photo Op — Then Ignored Counterpart first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "How Rueben Bain Jr., Miami defense wrecked Ohio State's bid for national title repeat at Cotton Bowl originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nHow would you grade what Miami defensive end Rueben Bain and the Hurricanes' defense brought to the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic?\n\nTry \"Category 5.\" That is how Miami legend Michael Irvin described the Hurricanes from the sideline during the first half.\n\n\"Category 5 you can't even hunker down in,\" Irvin screamed from the sidelines in the first half. \"All s— get torn up.'\n\n\"Hurricane Rueben\" tore it up, all right. Defensive end Rueben Bain Jr. was the center of the Miami storm that overtook AT&T Stadium. He made that kind of impact in the first half and when it mattered most in the fourth quarter for the Hurricanes.\n\nNo. 10 Miami beat No. 2 Ohio State 24-14 on Wednesday in the biggest College Football Playoff upset ever – a payback receipt from the 2003 BCS championship game the program had been dying to redeem.\n\nRemember, No. 2 Ohio State upset No. 1 Miami in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 3, 2003 – a game that featured 52 future NFL Draft picks. The Buckeyes took the mantle as a perennial national championship contender that night, too.\n\nIt was a role reversal this time.The Buckeyes (12-2) were the defending national champion. Ohio State allowed 8.2 points per game and had at least one consensus All-American at every level of their defense, including Kayden McDonald, Arvell Reese and Caleb Downs.\n\nMORE: Who does Miami face next?\n\nThey just didn't have Bain. The Hurricanes (12-2) out-flanked the Ohio State offense and Heisman Trophy finalist Julian Sayin – who took five sacks in the loss. Bain – a consensus All-American – led that defense to the CFP semifinals at the Vrbo Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 8 – one step closer to a championship appearance at their home field in Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla.\n\nMiami will face either No. 3 Georgia (12-1) or No. 6 Ole Miss (12-1) in the CFP semifinals, and that promises to be another \"rock fight\" which coach Mario Cristobal has embraced. He was asked about that physical play on the ESPN telecast afterward.\n\n\"Our guys have really worked on being a physical, violent bunch and you know what?\" Cristobal said before stopping himself. \"Coach Johnson!\"\n\nThat's Jimmy Johnson, of course, the coach who led Miami to a national championship in 1987. Irivin, Johnson, Ray Lewis and all the legends from that heyday witnessed the next Hurricanes' icon at work.\n\nBain made his presence felt in the first quarter when he set the edge by pushing Ohio State guard Austin Siereveld into running back Bo Jackson for a tackle for loss.\n\nRUEBEN BAIN JR. MADE THE TACKLE WHILE BEING BLOCKED 😳 pic.twitter.com/wlP4Tojdvm\n\n— ACC Network (@accnetwork) January 1, 2026\n\nBain had a sack in the second quarter, and edge rusher Akheem Mesidor added two sacks. That dynamic pass-rushing tandem kept the Buckeyes out of sorts for the first half. Bain shielded Sayin by jumping into the air on a screen pass, which defensive back Keionte Scott jumped and took 72 yards for a TD and a 14-0 lead with 11:49 left in the second quarter.\n\nThe Hurricanes limited the Buckeyes to 154 yards – including minus-three rushing yards – in the first half. Miami quarterback Carson Beck meanwhile, hit 14 of 18 passes for 98 yards and a touchdown.\n\nOhio State struck back in the second half. Sayin heated up, the Buckeyes had two TD drives of 11 and 10 plays, respectively, and cut the lead to 17-14 on a 14-yard TD pass to Jeremiah Smith with 13:28 remaining in the fourth quarter. Bain had been mostly quiet to that point, other than drawing a double team that set up a sack by Wesley Bissainthe.\n\nWhen the Buckeyes got the ball back, Bain stepped up again. After a third-and-15 conversion to Smith, Bain drew a holding penalty. Then he chased Sayin into a check-down that forced a punt. That was the defining sequence of the fourth quarter. Bain was relentless.\n\nThey say if you can’t get pressure rushing 4 then you aren’t a great defensive line, well Rueben Bain Jr. just got to the QB while rushing 3.\n\nTop-10 pick, explosiveness is other worldly and his speed is devious pic.twitter.com/6lm5Y0GRPW\n\n— BKS Sports (@BKSecretsports) January 1, 2026\n\nMiami drove 70 yards for the game-sealing TD – a 5-yard TD run by CharMar Brown. The Hurricanes had their biggest win since the 37-14 victory against No. 2 Nebraska at the 2002 BCS championship at the Rose Bowl.\n\nThis isn't that team. Those Hurricanes' teams had a lineage of seen-on-Sunday legends. This one is built around Beck – who finished 19 of 26 for 138 yards and running back Mark Fletcher Jr., who had 19 rushing attempts for 90 yards. Bain and Mesidor led the defense, and it was impressive.\n\nSayin finished 22 of 35 for 287 yards, a TD and two interceptions. Smith – a Miami, native – had seven catches for 157 yards and a TD. Yet the Buckeyes had just 24 rushing attempts for 45 yards. They also didn't have the best player in this playoff.\n\nThat is Bain. He has four of Miami's 12 sacks in two playoff games. He has to be in consideration to be the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, and with this defense the Hurricanes have a legitimate chance for a national championship for the first time since that fateful night in Tempe, Ariz. Now, the Hurricanes are back, and a SEC semifinalist is next.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSaturday night marks Part 4 of the Kyle Shanahan–Mike Macdonald series.\n\nThe latest chapter arrives in the final week of the NFL regular season, with the San Francisco 49ers hosting the Seattle Seahawks on Saturday night on ABC/ESPN.\n\nThe stakes could not be higher. The winner clinches the NFC’s No. 1 seed and the division title, while the loser is relegated to the wild-card field.\n\nOnce again, one of the league’s premier offenses will be tested by one of its top defenses. Through the first three meetings, Shanahan’s offense holds a 2–1 edge over Macdonald’s defense.\n\nSeattle enters the matchup boasting a top five defense, leading the NFL on third down, ranking second in points allowed, and sitting inside the top three against the run. However, the 49ers’ offense has been operating at an elite level in recent weeks.\n\nSan Francisco also ranks No. 1 in the league on third down, setting the stage for a fascinating contrast of strengths. The chess match between play caller and defensive architect is once again front and center.\n\nMacdonald addressed what he’s seeing from the 49ers’ offense during his media availability on Wednesday.\n\n“The great offensive play callers and designers in our league evolve consistently,” he said. “And (Shanahan’s) done it with the best of them.”\n\n“When you turn on the tape, maybe it’s one thing—no, it’s everything. They’re protecting Brock well. He’s making decisive decisions. He’s been accurate. And he’s got the element of being able to extend plays as well, creating maybe when the first couple reads aren’t there.”",

    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nThe first Iron Beam laser defense system was deployed by Israel on Sunday. This 100kW laser weapon thus became the world’s first high-power drone defense zapper to be operationally deployed. Iron Beam lasers will fortify Israel’s multi-layered defense, complementing the existing Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Arrow system architecture.\n\nThe Iron Beam is a short-range line-of-sight laser interceptor that is extremely cheap to run and, therefore, perfectly suited for intercepting low-cost, high-volume threats. According to the official Israeli announcement, Iron Beam systems have “successfully intercepted rockets, mortars, and UAVs.”\n\nA complex mix of government, military, scientific, and commercial interests were responsible for the research and development of the Iron Beam laser system. Central to the Iron Beam are “an advanced laser source and a unique electro-optical targeting system, enabling the interception of a wide range of targets at an enhanced operational range, with maximum precision and superior efficiency,” boasted the press release by Israel’s MoD. Moreover, it works “at a negligible marginal cost, which constitutes the laser system’s primary advantage.”\n\nWe don’t get much more by way of technical details, perhaps understandably. However, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems execs heralded the system’s “unique adaptive optics technology,” in what it calls “the world’s most advanced laser-based system for intercepting aerial threats.” Its operational debut “marks the beginning of the era of high-energy laser defense,” they claimed.\n\nWe have seen low-energy laser defense systems deployed earlier this year, with Japan’s NTT using relatively puny lasers to scare birds away from poultry farms and prevent the spread of avian flu. But the Iron Beam is in a different league.\n\nWe also previously reported on several other UK laser weapons under development to counter UAVs on land and at sea. But as far as we know, these are yet to become operational. With the brutal war between Ukraine and Russia ongoing, where drones have grown to be a pivotal feature of the conflict, forces have gone as far as creating rotating barbed wire barriers to deter them. So, laser-drone defenses similar to the Iron Beam are going to be in strong demand.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.",

    "fullText": "TOKYO (AP) — Japan is barreling forward with efforts to significantly boost its military capabilities to stand up to China’s growing threats by doubling annual arms spending. The goal comes as Tokyo’s main ally, the United States, pushes for more military assistance in Asia and a military hawk and ultra-conservative takes over Japan's leadership.\n\nJapan says it is still a peaceful nation and the buildup is necessary for a more self-reliant military that can better deter China. But Beijing and other critics see Japan as deviating from its postwar peace pledge, pointing to Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's statement soon after taking office that any Chinese military action against Taiwan could be grounds for a Japanese military response.\n\nJapan’s transformation into one of the world’s major defense spenders has developed over decades and raises the question of whether the ongoing buildup is a violation of its pacifist constitution.\n\nJapan’s constitution has been hollowed out\n\nAfter World War II, Japan was not supposed to have a military.\n\nDuring the 1945-1952 U.S. occupation, American officials wanted to stamp out the militarism that led to Japanese aggression across Asia before and during the war.\n\nUnder Article 9 of the U.S.-drafted 1947 constitution, Japan renounced the use of force to settle international disputes, and the right to maintain land, sea and air forces for that purpose.\n\nThe U.S. changed its mind about Japanese militarism when the Korean War started in 1950. Japan became an ally, not a threat, leading to the creation of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces in 1954. Article 9 is now widely seen as the legal basis for Japan to have a sufficient military to defend itself.\n\nJapan has since repeatedly stretched the definition of self-defense, allowing overseas dispatches of its troops as part of international peacekeeping operations, though mostly avoiding combat missions.\n\nA big change came in 2014, under former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who wanted Japan to have a normal military. Abe newly interpreted Article 9 as legalizing collective defense. The following year, a security law allowed Japan to use force if the United States or other friendly nations come under enemy attack, even if Japan is not being attacked.\n\nThis was Abe’s attempt to have a normal military without formally changing the constitution.\n\nTakaichi angered China by giving a hypothetical example of such a situation, a deviation from former leaders’ strategic ambiguity.\n\nThe flap with Beijing escalated in December when Chinese aircraft locked their radars, considered possible preparation for firing missiles, on Japanese planes during Chinese aircraft carrier drills near southwestern Japan.\n\nTwo Chinese aircraft carriers also were spotted in June operating near the southern Japanese island of Iwo Jima for the first time. This led to worry in Tokyo about Beijing’s rapidly expanding military activity far beyond its borders and in areas around islands claimed by both countries.\n\nTakaichi’s Cabinet last week approved a record defense budget plan. It exceeds 9 trillion yen ($58 billion) for the coming year and aims to fortify its strike-back capability and coastal defense with cruise missiles and unmanned arsenals.\n\nIn Beijing later that day, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian criticized the Takaichi government for accelerating the pace of its military buildup and expansion, and added: “Japan is deviating from the path of peaceful development it has long claimed to uphold and is moving further and further in a dangerous direction.”\n\nChina, which spends a huge amount on its own defense, may also see Takaichi as a defender of Japanese wartime aggression. Before taking office, she was a regular at Tokyo’s Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japan’s 2.5 million war dead, including convicted war criminals. Victims of Japanese aggression, especially China and the Koreas, see visits to the shrine as tantamount to a lack of remorse about Japan’s wartime past.\n\nTakaichi stayed away from Yasukuni in 2025 and sent a religious ornament marking the Aug. 15 anniversary of Japan’s defeat as a personal gesture instead of praying at the shrine.\n\nJapan takes on more offensive roles\n\nA fundamental change came in December 2022 when former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s government adopted a security strategy stating the need for Japan to acquire strike-back capability with long-range missiles, a major break from Japan’s self-defense-only policy.\n\nThe strategy names China as Japan’s biggest strategic challenge and calls for a more offensive role for Japanese troops under its security alliance with the U.S as the allies work more closely together.\n\nMasahiro Sakata, former head of the Cabinet Legislative Bureau, described the move as “the death of Article 9.”\n\nAfter the war, Japan long prioritized economic development over defense while relying largely on the U.S. by hosting about 50,000 American troops who also serve the region.\n\nJapan maintained a defense spending cap of 1% of GDP until the annual defense budget started to rise under Abe’s nearly decade-long leadership, to about 1.1%. Takaichi is certain to achieve a 2% target by March, two years earlier than planned, and is expected to push for more spending in coming years as Japan is under growing pressure after NATO adopted a new target of 5%.\n\nJapan plans to promote defense industry\n\nTakaichi’s revised security and defense policy would aim to further bolster Japan with unmanned combative weapons and long-range missiles. It is expected to scrap remaining restrictions on arms exports to promote the development of Japan’s defense industry and cooperation with friendly nations.\n\nJapan has long banned arms exports but has significantly eased restrictions in recent years and is now developing next-generation fighter jets with the UK and Italy while finalizing a deal to sell frigates to Australia. Japan also will to provide support for construction and maintenance for U.S. warships.\n\nA government-commissioned panel has proposed Japan consider developing a nuclear submarine to achieve a more long-distance deterrence capability, a controversial idea for a country that has long maintained non-nuclear principles.\n\nJapan has requested Washington ensure protection through the extended deterrence of nuclear weapons. A number of officials recently expressed support for Japan’s nuclear possession, which has led to criticism from Japanese atomic bomb survivors and other pacifist groups.\n\nJapan stands by its three non-nuclear principles of not possessing, not producing and not allowing its presence, according to Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, although he said Japan is considering all options for a possible new submarine.",

    "fullText": "Playing without Alperen Şengün should change the math for the Houston Rockets. On Saturday night, it only changed the look- and not in a way Cleveland was ready for.\n\nWith Şengün sidelined by a calf issue, Houston didn’t try to replace his production possession by possession. They redistributed responsibility. The offense flattened out, the pace stayed controlled, and the hierarchy became simple: defend first, move the ball early, and let Kevin Durant dictate when scoring was needed.\n\nWithout Houston’s usual post hub on the floor, Durant became both the pressure point and the release valve. He scored early, drew attention without forcing shots, and punished Cleveland for never fully committing to a double. He didn’t play hero ball, but he did ensure structure was maintained and embraced his role within it.\n\nSteven Adams anchored the paint, controlled the glass, and kept Cleveland from getting second chances. Tari Eason brought disruption and energy in the gaps. Reed Sheppard spaced the floor and punished late rotations. Everyone stayed in their lane.\n\nDefensively, the Rockets looked even more locked in. Without Şengün’s playmaking responsibilities to manage, Houston simplified reads, stayed connected, and turned stops into rhythm without rushing. And Cleveland never found a clean way to speed the game up.\n\nSaturday night proved that not only can Houston survive without Şengün- they can toggle styles when needed by leaning on defense, rebounding, and discipline, instead of flow. That kind of adaptability is the difference between a good team and a serious one.",

    "description": "The heat continues to get turned up on Matt Eberflus as the Cowboys are now just one game away from their offseason protocol.",
    "fullText": "Dallas Cowboys' owner Jerry Jones loves to tell everyone he'd do whatever it takes to buy a championship. We all know that's not exactly true, however. Jones doesn't like firing head coaches before their contracts run out, as witnessed by them retaining Mike McCarthy for 2024 despite there being top candidates on the market like Sean Payton and Mike MacDonald, both currently in line for No. 1 seeds in their second seasons with their orgs.\n\nAfter McCarthy didn't work out, he went for the cheap option of Brian Schottenheimer instead of getting into bidding wars for the top candidates in 2025. Now Schottenheimer is fighting to achieve .500 while Ben Johnson, Liam Coen and Mike Vrabel round out the top-5 Coach of the Year candidates with Payton and MacDonald. In other words, the Cowboys could do more to get them a championship.\n\nJones' claims are about to be put to the test, yet again. Dallas is expected to move on from defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus. The org felt like Eberflus got away years ago, as the promising LB coach went to Indy to be DC before being head coach in Chicago. His reunion hasn't worked out as the Cowboys have fielded one of the worst defenses in recent history.\n\nThe scheme hasn't fit the players, and Eberflus hasn't been flexible enough to adjust. It's hard to envision a fourth new coordinator in four seasons, but that's better than giving him another season to ruin in opposition to a top offense.\n\nFortunately, there are a few options for defensive coordinators in 2026. There is however, one who is currently standing tall above the rest: Minnesota Vikings DC Brian Flores.\n\nFlores' resume is ridiculously impressive. Just this season, they rank 10th in fewest points allowed and fifth in fewest yards allowed (going into Week 17). The fact that he's done this playing opposite a wholly inept offense for the year says a lot. Bad offense means the opposition gets more possessions and scoring opportunities, plus favorable field position.\n\nDespite this, they've held six different opponents under 20 points in a game. They've done this to three of their last four opponents, with only the Cowboys crossing the threshold. They were so good against Detroit on Thursday, they won despite the Vikings' offense passing for just three yards.\n\nThe Vikings forced six turnovers in the win. For comparison's sake, Dallas has only kept an opponent under 20 points once this season. Watching Flores' defense game in and game out over the last month has proven to many onlookers what Minnesota fans have known; he's a mastermind.\n\nBut Flores is far more than what he's accomplished this season. Flores is a master of his craft. He improved the Vikings' DVOA from 24th in 2022 to 11th in his first year, and they soared to No. 2 in 2024. He earned his stripes under Bill Belichick in New England, serving as an assistant from 2008 through 2018, getting a head coaching opportunity in Miami in 2019. He went 5-11, then 10-6 and then bounced back from a 1-7 start to finish 9-8 in 2021.\n\nBut it was there that Flores ran afoul of the league's top brass. Dolphins' owner Stephen Ross tried to hire Payton illegally (docked a first and third-round pick) and then Flores ended up suing the Dolphins and the league. He provided claims that the Dolphins owner wanted him to tank games, offering cash payments, which he refused to do.\n\nFlores' success in Miami and his success as a DC since have not landed him on many of the league's insiders lists of potential hiring candidates this round. If he doesn't land a top gig, he's actually out of contract with the Vikings. They talked last offseason of extending him, but that never came to fruition.\n\nSo now, unless something is worked out over the next 10 days, Flores will enter this offseason as a coaching free agent. With the possibility he could be interviewed for a head coach opening, it would seem foolish to re-up with the Vikings for their coordinator gig, but technically not impossible.\n\nIf he doesn't, which should be the case, that opens the door for the Cowboys to offer him the moon to come in and save their defense. Joining high-profile Dallas, being the savior their defensive woes, would absolutely be the feather in Flores' cap.\n\nHere's a look at the rest of our top five DC candidates.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cowboys Wire: Wk 17 Eberflus Replacement Rankings: Flores top Cowboys DC candidate",

Shoigu, to whom Sadavenko had reportedly acted as a “gatekeeper,” is now the secretary of Russia’s security council.\n\nSadavenko, who had been sanctioned by Britain and other western states, reportedly showed no signs of ill health before his death.\n\nHe had previously been embroiled in scandal after his wife, Maria Kitaeva, left him for another deputy defense minister, Timur Ivanov, according to The Sun.\n\nIvanov, 50, was arrested in April 2024 and convicted in July 2025 on charges of embezzlement and money laundering, receiving a 13-year prison sentence, the Associated Press reported.\n\nSince the Russia-Ukraine war began in February 2022, numerous top government officials have died under suspicious or sudden circumstances.\n\nOn Monday, a funeral was held in Moscow for Stanislav Orlov, 44, the head of a notorious volunteer brigade of neo-Nazi football hooligans who have fought in Ukraine.\n\nIndependent Russian news outlets have reported that Orlov, nicknamed the “Spaniard,” was ambushed and shot by Moscow’s own security forces earlier this month, according to The Guardian.\n\nOrlov’s death adds to a growing list of Russian military and civilian leaders who have died, most notably Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenaries.\n\nPrigozhin, 62, was killed in a plane crash in August 2023, weeks after he led an insurrection against Putin. He had once been close enough to the Russian dictator to earn the nickname “Putin’s chef.”\n\nIn July this year, Putin sacked Transport Minister Roman Starovoit, 53, who was found dead hours later in a park with a gunshot wound to the head. His death was ruled a suicide.\n\nOn the same day, Andrei Korneichuk, 42, another transportation official who had worked closely with Starovoit, collapsed and died of what was said to be a heart attack.\n\nOther deaths have long sparked jokes about staying away from windows and seen a series of former high-ranking officials being suddenly found dead stories below where they were last seen.\n\nHowever not all sudden deaths are equal. Ukraine has been able to assassinate several leading Russian military figures many hundreds of miles behind enemy lines in recent months.\n\nLast week, a top general, Lt. Gen.

    "title": "NATO is looking to Ukraine for ways to kill drones without wasting expensive missiles",
    "description": "Western militaries are looking at interceptor drones — proven in combat in Ukraine — as an ideal low-cost air defense.",
    "fullText": "NATO militaries are looking for cheaper ways to defeat hostile drones without having to expend vastly more expensive missiles. The answer, it seems, is in Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian forces are using domestically produced interceptor drones daily to bring down deadly Russian drones, with units regularly sharing footage of the high-speed aerial chases.\n\nThe interceptor drones can be mass-produced, which is crucial for Ukraine as worsening Russian bombardments that sometimes include hundreds of drones and missiles in a single night put stress on the country's deeply strained air defense network.\n\nNATO is taking note, with officials identifying interceptor drones not just as a cheap way to fill a capability gap — air defense against relatively inexpensive attack drones — but also as an early indication of where warfare is going. Some allied countries are developing systems, while others are rushing to buy them at scale.\n\n\"Technology is evolving really, really rapidly,\" British Army Brig. Gen. Chris Gent, the deputy chief of staff for transformation and integration at NATO Allied Land Command, said at a recent training event in Poland. \"It's a race to keep up.\"\n\nInterceptor drones emerged this year as a priority defense investment for Ukraine as it looks for ways to stay ahead of Russia's growing drone production and worsening nightly attacks without totally depleting its surface-to-air missile stocks or breaking the bank to take out cheap yet inexpensive threats.\n\nUkraine's defense industry produces hundreds of interceptor drones each day, some of which cost as little as $2,500. That's a fraction of the cost of a standard Russian one-way attack drone, estimated to be worth $35,000 on the low end. They can carry small warheads and are designed to directly strike their targets midair or explode nearby for a proximity kill.\n\nThe interceptor drones have provided Kyiv with a significant increase in air defense options. They can reach higher and faster-moving targets than the truck-mounted machine guns that Ukrainian soldiers had long relied on to shoot down low-flying Russian airborne targets, and they allow the country to hold its critical surface-to-air missiles in reserve for higher-end threats.\n\nSeeing how effective interceptor drones have been, NATO is now racing to develop and field its own. That push took on new urgency in September after Russian drones strayed into Polish and Romanian airspace, prompting Western forces to scramble fighter jets.\n\nThe incursions — and NATO's scramble to respond — raised questions about how the alliance should handle cheap drones, and whether it's sustainable to launch fighter jets armed with expensive missiles for every airspace violation.\n\nWhile NATO is still flying fighter patrols, Poland and Romania have purchased and are deploying the American-made Merops system, which consists of an interceptor drone that has already taken down more than 1,900 Russian targets for Ukraine.\n\nIn late November, Business Insider observed Polish, Romanian, and American forces training on the Merops system. Military officials touted the system's success in combat and its ability to provide NATO with a cheap air defense for its Eastern flank. (The interceptor drone costs $15,000, still less than the potential threats.)\n\nAt that training event, US Army Brig. Gen. Curtis King, the head of the 10th Army Air and Missile Defense Command, said that NATO needs to \"learn from what Ukraine is fighting right now.\"\n\nHe said that in addition to Poland, Romania, and the US, other NATO allies are experimenting with similar systems, the aim being to employ this technology across the alliance.\n\nAnd Western countries are linking up with the Ukrainians on this technology as well. In September, for instance, the UK announced plans to mass-produce thousands of Ukrainian-designed interceptor drones for Kyiv. The US is also making these weapons in collaboration with Ukraine.\n\nThe general said that getting Western firms to produce more interceptor drones will help drive the cost down even further for NATO countries interested in acquiring this technology.\n\nThe value is clear, King said. Procuring interceptor drones would allow NATO countries to save sophisticated air defenses, such as the MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missile system or certain air-to-air missiles, for threats like cruise and ballistic missiles, rather than one-way attack drones.\n\nInterceptor drones are among the newer innovations emerging from the war as Ukraine and Russia attempt to secure a technological advantage, with each new capability fielded pushing the other side to develop a countermeasure.\n\nAt the Merops training in Poland, Western officials said they are watching Ukraine and Russia race through cycles of weapons innovation at a pace that demands faster procurement before new tools become obsolete.\n\n\"The life cycle of technology has shortened dramatically,\" said Bart Hollants, NATO's innovation broker.\n\n\"It's not a new trend, but we see it on the battlefield in Ukraine,\" he told Business Insider, explaining that \"every six weeks to three months, there is a new iteration or a new version of tech that enters the front line, and that you have to defend yourself against, or that you have to create countermeasures for.\"\n\nWith that pacing in mind, NATO has turned to Western and Ukrainian defense firms for new ways to counter the war's biggest threats, giving these companies chances to pitch, test, and market systems as combat-ready.\n\nEarlier this year, NATO hosted an \"Innovation Challenge\" that brought in companies to present solutions for Russian glide bombs and one-way attack drones. Two firms — one French and the other German — won first and second place, respectively, for their solutions, made up of interceptor drones.\n\nFrench Cdr. Pierre Delom, a project coordinator at NATO's Allied Command Transformation who leads the Innovation Challenges, said that the alliance could find itself at war at any moment and needed to be ready.\n\nThe key, he told Business Insider, is the mass production of affordable air defenses so that NATO doesn't have to spend any more money to counter low-cost threats than necessary. In a future fight, these threats may be out in force, and the alliance can't afford to pour expensive missiles into that fight. Sustainability is about making every dollar count.",

    "fullText": "China announced sanctions against 20 US defense companies and 10 senior executives on Friday, citing US arms sales to Taiwan as its motive.\n\nIn a statement, China's foreign ministry said their assets within China, including movable and immovable properties, would be frozen and that domestic organizations and individuals would be prohibited from doing business with them.\n\nIndividuals named on the list would also be denied visas and entry to the country, the ministry added.\n\nThe sanctions list includes Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, Boeing's St. Louis branch, Epirus, and Anduril Industries founder Palmer Luckey.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the foreign ministry said: \"We stress once again that the Taiwan question is at the very core of China's core interests and the first red line that must not be crossed in China.\"\n\n\"Any company or individual who engages in arms sales to Taiwan will pay the price for the wrongdoing,\" they added.\n\nAnduril did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider sent outside normal US working hours.\n\nChina's sanctions follow the US announcement of a $11 billion military package for Taiwan last week.\n\nThe deal, which includes self-propelled Howitzers and HIMARS rocket launchers, still needs to be approved by Congress — but it drew a swift response from Beijing.\n\nLin Jian, a spokesperson for the foreign ministry, said in a statement at the time that China \"strongly deplores and firmly opposes\" the sales.\n\nChina regards Taiwan as a breakaway province that will one day come under Beijing's control, and Chinese President Xi Jinping has refused to rule out an invasion of the island. Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party views Taiwan as separate from China.\n\nUnder the Taiwan Relations Act, the US is obligated to assist Taiwan in defending itself.\n\nBeijing has ramped up pressure around the island in recent years, holding frequent military exercises in the surrounding skies and waters.\n\nA 2024 report by the Washington, D.C.-based think tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies suggested that China may be able to exert power over Taiwan without launching an invasion.\n\nThe report said China could impose a quarantine of the island using its coast guard.\n\n\"The purpose of a quarantine is not to completely seal Taiwan off from the world but to assert China's control over Taiwan by setting the terms for traffic in and out of the island,\" it argued.\n\n\"A key goal is to compel countries and companies to comply with China's terms.\"",

    "fullText": "Give credit to the Kansas City Chiefs defense, and to tight end Travis Kelce—they both came to play, and as a result the Chiefs were nearly able to pull off an improbable upset against the Denver Broncos, but the Chiefs’ offensive limitations ultimately resulted in a 20-13 loss.\n\nThis game was defined by four long Denver drives, one in each quarter. The first two came up short to produce a pair of Wil Lutz field goals, with gave the Chiefs a chance to hang around and counter with a touchdown on a short drive after a Bo Nix interception to make the score 7-6 at halftime.\n\nThe TD came on a 4-yard pass to running back Brashard Smith, and it was the first career touchdown bass for the Chiefs third-string quarterback, Chris Oladokun.\n\nThe Chiefs actually scored first in the third quarter after a pass interference penalty on Broncos cornerback Pat Surtain II in Denver territory led to a 53-yard field goal by Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker that made it 10-6.\n\nThe Broncos proceeded to drive the field again, and this time Nix was able to finish by running the ball in from nine yards out for Denver’s first touchdown of the night. That gave the Broncos the lead, 13-10, but the Chiefs were able to counter with yet another Butker field goal from 47 yards after a 44-yard punt return by Smith.\n\nDenver’s final drive of the game was the fourth one to last for at least 14 plays, and Nix finished the 65-yard effort with a one-yard touchdown pass to running back RJ Harvey. The key play in the drive was a defensive offside penalty by Chiefs tackle Chris Jones that gave Denver a critical red-zone first down that led to the score.\n\nIt’s remarkable that the Chiefs were even able to give themselves a chance in this one. Oladokun passed for just 66 yards on the night as he went 13-for-22, although he did remain turnover-free. The running game had some moments as the Chiefs were able to pick up some occasional first downs, but Kansas City was simply outgunned in this one due to their quarterback injury issues.\n\nThe highlight of the night for the Chiefs was the final drive, which featured some receiving highlights from Kelce, who put Kansas City on his back and nearly win the game single-handed. Kelce was eventually double-teamed, though, and a final pass to receiver Hollywood Brown in the end zone wound up being an overthrow tight as Denver survived.\n\nThe Broncos will move on to play the Los Angeles Chargers for the AFC West title next week, assuming the Chargers can beat the Houston Texans on Saturday. That will officially end the Chiefs’ run of division titles at nine, while the Chiefs will close out their broken season against the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 18.",

    "fullText": "TOKYO (AP) — Japan's Cabinet on Friday approved a record defense budget plan exceeding 9 trillion yen ($58 billion) for the coming year, aiming to fortify its strike-back capability and coastal defense with cruise missiles and unmanned arsenals as tensions rise in the region.\n\nThe draft budget for fiscal 2026 beginning April is up 9.4% from 2025 and marks the fourth year of Japan’s ongoing five-year program to double annual arms spending to 2% of gross domestic product.\n\nThe increase comes as Japan faces elevated tension from China. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in November that her country's military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing says must come under its rule.\n\nTakaichi’s government, under U.S. pressure for a military increase, pledged to achieve the 2% target by March, two years earlier than planned. Japan also plans to revise the ongoing security and defense policy by December 2026 to further strengthen its military.\n\nMissiles and drones will add to southwestern island defense\n\nJapan has been bolstering its offensive capability with long-range missiles to attack enemy targets from a distance, a major break from its post-World War II principle limiting the use of force to own self-defense.\n\nThe current security strategy, adopted in 2022, names China as the country’s biggest strategic challenge and calls for a more offensive role for Japan’s Self-Defense Force under its security alliance with the U.S.\n\nThe new budget plan allocates more than 970 billion yen ($6.2 billion) to bolster Japan's “standoff” missile capability. It includes a 177 billion-yen ($1.13 billion) purchase of domestically developed and upgraded Type-12 surface-to-ship missiles with a range of about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles).\n\nThe first batch of the Type-12 missiles will be deployed in Japan's southwestern Kumamoto prefecture by March, a year earlier than planned, as Japan accelerates its missile buildup in the region.\n\nIn part due to Japan's aging and declining population and its struggles with an understaffed military, the government believes unmanned weapons are essential.\n\nTo defend the coasts, Japan will spend 100 billion yen ($640 million) to deploy “massive” unmanned air, sea-surface and underwater drones for surveillace and defense under a system called “SHIELD\" planned for March 2028, defense ministry officials said.\n\nFor speedier deployment, Japan initially plans to rely mainly on imports, possibly from Turkey or Israel.\n\nThe budget announcement comes as Japan’s row with China escalate following Takaichi's remark in November that Japanese military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its own.\n\nThe disagreement escalated this month when Chinese aircraft carrier drills near southwestern Japan prompted Tokyo to protest when Chinese aircraft locked their radar on Japanese aircraft, which is considered possible preparation for firing missiles.\n\nThe Defense Ministry, already been alarmed by China’s rapid expansion of operations in the Pacific, will open a new office dedicated to studying operations, equipment and other necessities for Japan to deal with China's Pacific activity.\n\nTwo Chinese aircraft carriers were spotted in June almost simultaneously operating near southern Japanese island of Iwo Jima for the first time, fueling Tokyo’s concern about Beijing’s rapidly expanding military activity far beyond its borders and areas around the disputed East China Sea islands.\n\nJapan plans joint development of frigates and jets\n\nJapan is pushing to strengthen its largely domestic defense industry by participating in joint development with friendly nations, and promoting foreign sales, after drastically easing arms export restrictions in recent years.\n\nFor 2026, Japan plans to spend more than 160 billion yen ($1 billion) to jointly develop a next-generation fighter jet with Britain and Italy for deployment in 2035. There also are plans for research and development of AI-operated drones designed to fly with the jet.\n\nIn a major boost to the country's defense industry, Australia selected Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in August to upgrade Mogami-class frigate to replace its fleet of 11 ANZAC-class ships.\n\nJapan's budget allocates nearly 10 billion yen ($64 million) to support industry base and arms sales.\n\nMeeting targets but future funding uncertain\n\nThe budget plan requires parliamentary approval by March to be implemented as part of a 122.3 trillion yen ($784 billion) national budget bill.\n\nThe five-year defense buildup program would bring Japan's annual spending to around 10 trillion yen ($64 billion), making it the world’s third-largest spender after the U.S. and China. Japan will clear the 2% target by March as promised, the Finance Ministry said.\n\nTakaichi’s government plans to fund its growing military spending by raising corporate and tobacco taxes and recently adopted a plan for income tax increase beginning 2027. Prospects for future growth at a higher percentage of GDP is unclear.",

    "description": "The North American Aerospace Defense Command has been tracking the location of Santa Claus for children since 1955.",
    "fullText": "It’s back! In what has become an annual ritual for millions on Christmas Eve, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, is tracking Santa Claus’s journey from the North Pole to deliver gifts to children across the globe.\n\nNORAD’s Santa Claus tracker website — NORADSanta.org — includes a map that allows users to track Santa’s location in real time. The site attracts tens of millions of visitors every year.\n\nBeginning at midnight on Christmas Eve, the site utilizes satellite mapping technology and digital animation to simulate the route of Santa’s reindeer and sleigh.\n\nThe tracker also features a live count of gifts delivered by Jolly Old St. Nick. At the time of this publication, that figure was more than 1.3 billion.\n\nThe practice began in 1955 when a child accidentally called the unlisted number of what was then the Continental Air Defense Command Operations Center, asking for Santa Claus.\n\nNot wanting to disappoint the young caller, Air Force Col. Harry Shoup, the command center’s director of operations, “instructed his staff to check the radar for indications of Santa making his way south from the North Pole,” according to NORAD. Each year since, NORAD has dutifully reported Santa’s location on Dec. 24 to millions of children and families.\n\nThe binational military organization, based in Colorado Springs, Colo., eventually enlisted volunteers to answer a dedicated phone line to give updates on Santa’s whereabouts. In recent years, those volunteers have included pop stars, presidents and first ladies.\n\nAnd the hotline still exists: You can call 877-HI-NORAD (877-446-6723) to reach one of the call center’s operators. (President Trump is scheduled to field NORAD Santa calls from Palm Beach, Fla., on Wednesday afternoon.) Last Christmas Eve, it logged more than 300,000 calls.\n\n📞 NORAD Tracks Santa Call Center Update\n\nWe’ve received more than 14,000 calls from families around the world so far today.\n\nOur volunteers are standing by, answering questions and sharing Santa’s latest location as he continues his journey. Thank you to everyone taking part in… pic.twitter.com/MNxTCCaZq4\n\n— NORAD Tracks Santa (@NoradSanta) December 24, 2025\n\nJust don’t ask when Santa will arrive at your house.\n\n“NORAD tracks Santa, but only Santa knows his route, which means we cannot predict where and when he will arrive at your house,” the organization explains on its FAQ page. “We do, however, know from history that it appears he arrives only when children are asleep!”",

    "description": "Coach JJ Redick says the Lakers will not make all the correct choices, but \"can you make the vast majority of 'em correctly? It gives you a chance to win.\"",
    "fullText": "It’s not the lineups, the injuries or necessarily the system. The cause of the Lakers' defensive demise is a thousand little decisions gone wrong.\n\n“It comes down to just making the choice,” coach JJ Redick said after the Lakers gave up 132 points in a blowout loss to the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday. “It's making the choice. There's shortcuts you can take or you can do the hard thing and you can make the second effort or you can sprint back or you can't. It's just a choice and there's a million choices in a game, and you're very likely not gonna make every choice correctly. But can you make the vast majority of 'em correctly? It gives you a chance to win.”\n\nComing off back-to-back losses for the first time this season, the Lakers (19-9) are ranked 28th in defensive rating in the last 14 games entering a Christmas Day showcase against the Houston Rockets at 5 p.m. PST at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nThe Lakers, without any individual shutdown defenders, need a perfectly executed team defense to compete. But 15 different starting lineups in 28 games has delayed some of the team's ability to build continuity. The Lakers have had their full complement of 14 standard contract players for two games.\n\nForward Rui Hachimura (groin) and Luka Doncic (leg) could return Thursday. Guard Gabe Vincent, one of the team’s top defensive options on the perimeter, will miss his fourth game with lower-back soreness. Center Jaxson Hayes tweaked his left ankle in the second quarter of Tuesday’s loss and didn’t return.\n\nThe Rockets (17-10) limp into the Christmas Day blockbuster with their own struggles. The team thought to be one of the few who could challenge Oklahoma City in the West has lost five of its last seven games. Three of the losses were in overtime and four came against teams currently out of the play-in picture, including Tuesday’s loss to the Clippers.\n\nLed by Kevin Durant’s 25.2 points, the Rockets are a statistical anomaly in the sped up, possession-maximizing modern NBA. They have the third-ranked offense in the league despite being one of the slowest. They shoot the fewest three-pointers per game, but make them at a 40% clip that ranks second, and dominate the glass with NBA-leading 48.7 rebounds and 16.1 offensive rebounds per game.\n\nHouston’s physicality and expertise on the boards could be especially worrisome for a team that still has to consciously choose defense on a possession-by-possession basis instead of consistently living up to a standard of playing hard.\n\n“There's really no defense, no scheme we can do when we're giving up offensive rebounds in crucial moments like we are, our [opponents] are getting wherever they want on the court,” guard Marcus Smart said after Tuesday’s loss. “And there's no help, there's no resistance, there's no urgency. … It's on us.”\n\nThe Suns grabbed 12 offensive rebounds against the Lakers on 35 missed shots, an offensive rebounding rate of 34.3%. After the Suns scored a three-pointer by twice grabbing offensive rebounds off tipped balls, Lakers players had an animated discussion in a timeout with Smart was gesturing toward center Deandre Ayton about tipping rebounds. Ayton, who finished with 10 rebounds and 12 points, and Smart ended the timeout with a high-five.\n\n“[I need to] just continue to talk to guys, even though sometimes they might not want to hear it,” said Smart, a free-agent addition the Lakers coveted for his leadership and tenacity on defense. “Especially when we losing, nobody wants to hear it, myself included, but also understand that it's integral for us to hear those things, to see and to be able to talk to one another and figure it out as players on the court, because we're the ones out there.”\n\nRedick intentionally built in moments for players to connect and communicate during every timeout this season before coaches speak. The strategy was meant to encourage players to take a larger leadership role. “Championship communication” was one of the team’s three pillars.\n\nAlong with “championship shape,” Redick also asked his team to build “championship habits.” Living up to the mantras is easier said than done.\n\n“It's not the easy choice,” Redick said. “It's human nature. … We do it on a daily basis. We make easy choices cause it's comfortable. Comfortable doesn't win.”\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLast week, the Seattle Seahawks got their biggest win of the season with a win over their division rival, the Los Angeles Rams, in an overtime thriller on 'Thursday Night Football' with a walk-off two-point conversion.\n\nAlthough the win was huge for the team, it puts them in firm control of home-field advantage and the playoffs running through Lumen Field; not everything from that game was good news for the Hawks.\n\nAfter the game, it was announced that linebacker Derick Hall had been suspended for one game after being accused of intentionally stepping on Rams guard Kevin Dotson. Hall attempted to appeal the decision after it became clear that the incident could be seen as accidental to some, but the suspension was upheld.\n\nEven though the result of the situation was unfortunate, as it resulted in Dotson suffering a sprained right ankle and having to be carted off the field, it should be looked upon as a wasted appeal, because it does not look as if Hall was intending to injure Dotson purposely.\n\nMore: Seahawks get bad news from NFL on Derick Hall's suspension\n\nSeahawks head coach Mike Macdonald would agree with that statement, and he made it clear how he feels about the suspension being upheld when asked about the situation during a media session on Wednesday.\n\n\"We accept the decision, even if we don't agree with it.

    "fullText": "In Week 17, a struggling Arizona Cardinals offense will meet a common salve: the Cincinnati Bengals defense.\n\nThat group might be the worst single unit in the NFL. If not, it’s in a tight race with the Raiders offense. The Bengals rank 32nd in points allowed, 32nd in yards per game and 32nd in yards per play. For those needing a refresher, the NFL still has 32 teams.\n\nSo, the question is: Outside of Trey McBride, which Cardinals players will be in position to take advantage?\n\nAt wide receiver, the picture is complicated.\n\nMarvin Harrison Jr. returned to action last week after missing two games with a heel injury, but he remained limited, playing just 51% of snaps and 62% of passing plays. His three targets matched a career low, outside of the two games that he has exited with concussions.\n\nEarlier in the week, head coach Jonathan Gannon was asked how Harrison emerged from the game and offered a mixed response.\n\n“Okay,” Gannon said. “I think he'll be ready for more. We'll see how it kinda goes here. Obviously, we had a plan for his reps, where he was at health wise. I know he wants to play more. So we'll see where he's at. Take it day by day.”\n\nOffensive coordinator Drew Petzing also acknowledged that Harrison is not at full strength.\n\n“Does it limit some of the things you're gonna do or some of the reps he's gonna get?” Petzing said. “Yes, maybe, at times.”\n\nBut despite Harrison’s limited role, his return still led to a decreased involvement for Michael Wilson.\n\nIn four games without Harrison, Wilson has averaged 10 catches on 15 targets for 125 yards. In the past two games that Harrison has played, those averages have dropped to three catches on five targets for 44 yards.\n\nGannon, though, noted that the Falcons prioritized taking away the Cardinals’ passing attack in last week’s game. They played cover-4 on 45.5% of snaps, roughly double the season-long rate of cover-4 that the Cardinals have faced. That was reflected in the target distribution, as 69% of Jacoby Brissett’s targets went to tight ends and running backs.\n\nThe Bengals deploy cover-4 at just a 5.2% rate, opening more opportunities for outside receivers. With Harrison still working through his heel injury, that could enable Wilson’s production to tick back up.\n\nAs expected, Michael Carter led the Cardinals' backfield in Week 16, following Bam Knight’s season-ending injury.\n\nCarter’s role, though, was smaller than anticipated. He saw 11 of the Cardinals’ 22 running back carries and played just 53% of snaps.\n\nEmari Demercado took five carries on a 32% snap share while Corey Kiner took six carries on a 16% snap share.\n\nBut when asked whether he anticipated Kiner seeing six carries again this week, Petzing instead took the opportunity to praise Carter.\n\n“I think it can always change based on the flow of the game and riding the hot hand and who's producing,” Petzing said. “I thought Michael did a really nice job in the run game, producing some explosive run gains. Really making some decisive runs and even some dirty runs that maybe were gonna be two or three-yard runs, turned them into four, five, six-yard runs.”\n\nAll nine of Kiner’s snaps came on one second-quarter drive, spelling Carter. That drive just happened to be the Cardinals’ longest of the game, at 13 plays, giving him more carries than expected.\n\nAs for Demercado, 17 of his 18 snaps either came on third-and-long or in end-of-half situations. That has been his role all season, as the Cardinals prefer to deploy him on passing downs.\n\nSo, what does that mean against the Bengals?\n\nCarter will likely be the early-down back, with Demercado playing passing downs and Kiner offering a change-of-pace option. If the Cardinals are leading, Carter could be more involved, while Demercado will see more usage if they find themselves trailing, as is typically the case.\n\nBut if the Bengals opt for a more typical defensive gameplan than the Falcons did — with fewer light boxes and shell coverages ­— the Cardinals could struggle to replicate their run efficiency. Their 5.7 yards per carry last week were their second most of the season.\n\nFor the second consecutive year, tight end Trey McBride and safety Budda Baker were the only two Cardinals’ players named to the Pro Bowl. Edge rusher Josh Sweat was named as an alternate.\n\nMcBride is having one of the best tight end seasons in NFL history, with 109 catches for 1,098 yards and 10 touchdowns. With eight more catches, he would set the single-season record for catches by a tight end.\n\nBaker, meanwhile, has taken a step back from his typical elite-level play. He is among the league leaders in missed tackles and has not stopped as many run plays at or near the line of scrimmage — partially due to a thumb injury that has forced him to play with a cast. But he’s been one of the league’s most impactful defensive players for the past decade, a status that often earns players Pro Bowl recognition even in down seasons.\n\nMcBride and Baker were both on the Cardinals’ roster when the current staff was hired in 2023. That means that general manager Monti Ossenfort has not acquired a Pro Bowler in his three seasons in charge, unless Sweat is added to the roster.\n\nOssenfort was the only general manager hired in 2023 but, as a comparison, eight general managers were hired in 2021 or 2022. All eight acquired at least one Pro Bowler in their first three seasons.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Assessing Cardinals' Michael Carter, Michael Wilson roles for Week 17",

    "title": "JPMorgan challenges Charlie Javice's $78 million legal defense fees, citing $161 seafood tower and $530 in gummy bears",
    "description": "JPMorgan Chase claims lawyers for Charlie Javice invoiced pointless work and outrageous expenses.",
    "fullText": "$161 for a seafood tower? Seems fishy.\n\nThat's what JPMorgan Chase's lawyers told a Delaware judge on Friday in an effort to get out of paying the rest of Charlie Javice's legal bill.\n\nThe bank sued Javice in late 2022, claiming that she and her cofounder, Olivier Amar, had faked data to inflate the value of their startup, Frank, which JPMorgan Chase paid $175 million to acquire. But Javice won an order requiring the bank to advance her legal fees, which is common in merger agreements.\n\nThree years later, JPMorgan claims that Javice and her lawyers have milked that order far past the point of what's reasonable. The 15 pounds of receipts submitted for reimbursement include high-end hotels, first-class flights, $530 in gummy bears, \"copious amounts of alcohol,\" and \"a $581 dinner for two that included a $161 seafood tower.\"\n\nThe bank's lawyers said Javice's lawyers continued to expense personal items into 2025, \"including a pet hair roller, laptop privacy screens, stain remover, allergy and cold medication, nutritional supplements, tea strainer, face masks, a coffee maker, lamps, a kettle, Uber rides for ordinary daily commute to a timekeeper's home office, 'groceries for meal prep,' bottles of wine, batteries, room upgrade charges at $300 per night, and meals at New York's best restaurants.\"\n\nIt blasted law firm Quinn Emanuel for a $60 Uber Eats order that included \"four cookies and a cookie box.\"\n\nQuinn Emanuel, which is representing Javice in the Delaware court case, said in a statement to Business Insider that JPMorgan \"is trying to walk away from its contractual obligation to pay Ms. Javice's legal bills.\" The bank is \"highlighting a handful of attorney expenses (not incurred by Ms. Javice) over two years, the vast majority of which it already reviewed and paid or are not disputed,\" Quinn Emmanuel spokesman Eric Herman said.\n\nThe bank also challenged the fees that Javice's lawyers charged for their time, as high as $2,700 per hour, including billing for trial attendance on a Saturday and other \"non-trial days.\"\n\nJPMorgan's lawyers said there were a total of 147 people — like lawyers and paralegals — who billed time to her defense, with the total bills across her criminal and civil cases crossing the $78 million mark. The bank said it has paid $60 million so far and says it shouldn't have to pay any more.\n\nMost of Javice's bills, $47 million, have been rung up by Quinn Emanuel, whose team was led by celebrity lawyer Alex Spiro and partner Samuel Nitze, who co-chairs Quinn's crisis law and strategy group. Another $14 million was billed by attorney Jose Baez, a trial lawyer who defended Casey Anthony; $5 million by his frequent co-counsel, the Harvard law professor Ronald Sullivan; and $11 million by Mintz, another big law firm.\n\nNearly all of the bills, $73 million, were incurred in Charlie Javice's criminal case. Javice was convicted of fraud and sentenced to seven years behind bars. The rest was incurred in civil cases. JPMC said Amar, the co-founder of Frank, who was sentenced to five years and eight months in prison, charged tens of millions of additional fees for his defense.",

    "fullText": "Jacob Rodriguez was sleeping on the floor of his brother’s apartment and learning how to really play defense when he joined Texas Tech for spring practice in 2022, right after a season as a quarterback at Virginia.\n\nSuddenly a walk-on on the other side of the ball, Rodriguez even wondered if he might get cut by the Red Raiders.\n\n\"They’re trying to weed everybody out because it’s coach (Joey) McGuire’s first offseason,\" he said. “So, I'm just out there trying to make the team and then focus on football. It was real weird, totally different position.”\n\nQB-turned-linebacker Rodriguez is now an AP All-American for fourth-ranked Tech, which is in the College Football Playoff for the first time. The team captain with a distinctive mustache, whose wife flies Black Hawk helicopters in the U.S. Army, has a collection of trophies for national defensive player of the year awards, and was fifth in the Heisman Trophy voting. He is the first FBS player in 20 years with at least five forced fumbles (he has seven), two fumble recoveries and four interceptions in the same season.\n\n“He’s just a man of consistency, a man of routine and he’s just a great leader overall,” said Tech senior edge rusher David Bailey, a first-year transfer and also an AP All-America first-teamer.\n\nThe Red Raiders (12-1), in McGuire's fourth season, play No. 5 Oregon (12-1) in the CFP quarterfinal Orange Bowl on New Year's Day. The first-time Big 12 Conference champions already have a school-record 12 wins.\n\nRodriguez won the Chuck Bednarik and Bronko Nagurski awards as the top defensive player, and the Dick Butkus Award as the top linebacker. He got the Lombardi Award that's for exceptional performance while embodying character and discipline like the award's namesake.\n\nRodriguez played a little bit of safety in high school, but when he got to Tech he hadn’t been a linebacker since middle school, when the approach was much different.\n\n“I had no clue what I was doing. I was just going see ball, hit ball,” he said. “You’re playing linebacker, but you don’t have to study film, and you don’t have to understand the position as much.”\n\nAs a prep starting quarterback, Rodriguez accounted for 10,136 total yards (7,085 passing, 3,051 rushing) and 106 touchdowns (68 passing, 38 rushing) as Wichita Falls Rider made the Texas Class 5A playoffs three years in a row. He was then an early enrollee at Virginia, which gave him a scholarship offer as a quarterback. He never threw a pass in his 12 games with the Cavaliers, but had 56 yards rushing and 65 receiving while used as a running back, receiver and tight end. He left there after a coaching change.\n\n“It’s just really cool to see the way that his story has developed, and the kind of guy that he is,” said fifth-year Tech quarterback Behren Morton, a fellow Texan who was in some of the same camps as Rodriguez before college. “He’s probably put on close to 50 pounds, and just totally transformed his body to looking like a mean linebacker.”\n\nRodriguez played special teams and some defensive packages during his Tech debut in 2022, when he had 29 tackles and began to embrace being on that side.\n\n“Really just knowing that I can make an impact whatever position I play. I’ve done it on the offensive side of the ball, I’ve done it on the defensive side of a ball, and I’ve done it on special teams. I can really play with anybody,\" he said. “That’s kind of when I figured I can do this. I saw myself progressing a lot on the defensive side of the ball, and week to week just getting better and better.”\n\nHe was limited to five games in 2023 after injuring his foot in the opener on a play that he forced and recovered a fumble. His 127 tackles last year were the most for a Tech player since Lawrence Flugence set an NCAA FBS record with 193 in 2002. He has 117 this season after Tech reportedly invested more than $7 million on transfers along the defensive front, including Bailey, second-team AP All-America interior lineman A.J. Holmes Jr., and third-teamer Lee Hunter.\n\nAs tough as Rodriguez is, the 6-foot-1, 235-pound linebacker said there is no doubt that his wife Emma is even tougher.\n\nThe high school sweethearts got married in July 2023. Emma graduated from the United States Military Academy and is now based at Fort Riley in Kansas.\n\n\"She's the best, and she does so much for me,\" Jacob Rodriguez said. \"It's weird, I feel like to everybody else, that we do long distance and have done it. But I mean to us, it’s normal. It’s something that we’ve always done.”\n\nWhile disappointed he didn't get an invitation to New York for the Heisman Trophy ceremony, Rodriguez was grateful and honored by the final results. His 17 first-place votes were nine more than Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin, the fourth-place finisher. Indiana QB Fernando Mendoza won the Heisman ahead of Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia and Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love.\n\n“I’m just so appreciative to even be in that conversation,\" Rodriguez said. \"That kind of hit home, was people really cared about me and see what the work that’s been done this year.”\n\nRodriguez has scored three touchdowns this season. He returned a fumble for a score against Oklahoma, and had short rushing TDs on his only carries when taking a direct snap in each of the last two regular-season games.\n\n“It was exciting and it was fun,” he said. “Those are the moments that I’ll never forget, where it’s just having fun playing football.”\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "fullText": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump is gathering with top national security officials on Monday, a meeting that comes as the U.S. Coast Guard steps up efforts to interdict oil tankers in the Caribbean Sea as part of the Republican administration's escalating pressure campaign on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's government.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Navy Secretary John Phelan are scheduled to join Trump, who is vacationing at his Mar-a-Lago resort, for what the White House called a \"major announcement.\" Trump plans to discuss a shipbuilding initiative at the event, according to a White House official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nBut Trump's gathering of key members of his national security team also comes at yet another inflection point in Trump's four-month pressure campaign on the Maduro government, which began with the stated purpose of stemming the flow of illegal drugs from the South American nation but has developed into something more amorphous.\n\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry has started evacuating the families of diplomats from Venezuela, according to a European intelligence official speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information.\n\nThe official told The Associated Press the evacuations include women and children and began on Friday. The official said Russian Foreign Ministry officials are assessing the situation in Venezuela in “very grim tones.” The White House and Kremlin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn the Caribbean, the U.S. Coast Guard on Monday continued for the second day to chase a sanctioned oil tanker that the Trump administration describes as part of a “dark fleet” Venezuela is using to evade U.S. sanctions. The tanker, the official added, is flying under a false flag and is under a U.S. judicial seizure order.\n\nIt is the third ship pursued by the Coast Guard, which on Saturday seized a Panama-flagged vessel called Centuries that U.S. officials said was part of the Venezuelan shadow fleet.\n\nThe Coast Guard, with assistance from the Navy, seized a sanctioned tanker called Skipper on Dec. 10, also part of the shadow fleet of tankers that the U.S. says operates on the fringes of the law to move sanctioned cargo. That ship was registered in Panama.\n\nTrump, after that first seizure, said the U.S. would carry out a “blockade” of Venezuela. Trump has repeatedly said that Maduro's days in power are numbered.\n\nLast week, Trump demanded that Venezuela return assets that it seized from U.S. oil companies years ago, justifying anew his announcement of a “blockade” against sanctioned oil tankers traveling to or from the South American country.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose agency oversees the Coast Guard, said in a Monday appearance on “Fox & Friends” that the targeting of tankers is intended to send “a message around the world that the illegal activity that Maduro is participating in cannot stand, he needs to be gone, and that we will stand up for our people.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Defense Department, under Trump's orders, continues its campaign of attacks on smaller vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean that it alleges are carrying drugs to the United States and beyond.\n\nAt least 104 people have been killed in 28 known strikes since early September. The strikes have faced scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and human rights activists, who say the administration has offered scant evidence that its targets are indeed drug smugglers and that the fatal strikes amount to extrajudicial killings.",

    "description": "Texas Tech football has a defense for the ages this season. The architect of the Red Raiders' next best defenses, Richard Bell, died this month.",
    "fullText": "The Texas Tech football team's average yield of 10.92 points per game this season would be a school record for scoring defense in the modern era, defined by the National Football Foundation as 1950 and later.\n\nOver the past 60 years, Tech's next five stingiest defenses by average points allowed came in the five consecutive seasons from 1970-74. Those are the years Richard Bell was the Red Raiders' defensive coordinator, or head defensive coach, as he was commonly referenced.\n\n\"Oh, wow,\" said Tommy Cones, a Red Raiders defensive end who lettered from 1972-74. \"Well, that tells you a lot right there. Numbers don't lie, right?\"\n\n\"That's amazing. That's amazing,\" said Gaines Baty, a defensive end who lettered from 1970-72. \"Well, he was known across the country as a defensive expert.\"\n\nBell died on Dec. 13 in Woodstock, Georgia. He was 88.\n\nMore: Texas Tech football's Jacob Rodriguez on Heisman vote, awards circuit\n\nHis passing prompted reflection among those who played under him.\n\n\"Richard Bell was the epitome of character, integrity, intensity, passion and excellence,\" Baty said. \"He set a high standard for the football team, as well as personally for every player on that team.\"\n\nBell came to Texas Tech from West Virginia with head coach Jim Carlen in 1970 and followed Carlen to South Carolina after the 1974 season. Tech and Vanderbilt played to a 6-6 tie in the Peach Bowl on Dec. 28, 1974, before Vandy coach Steve Sloan switched programs. Late on New Year's Eve, Sloan announced he was staying at Vanderbilt, but he changed his mind and accepted the Texas Tech job on New Year's Day.\n\nThe next day, the Avalanche-Journal reported Bell, according to Texas Tech insiders, \"would have landed the job had Sloan not reconsidered during the wee hours of New Year's morn.\"\n\nBell was a college head coach for only one year, going 4-7 in 1982 at South Carolina.\n\nHis long coaching career included stints as defensive coordinator at West Virginia (1968-69), Texas Tech (1970-74), South Carolina (1975-81), Duke (1983-87), East Carolina (1988), Georgia (1989-93), Navy (1994) and Air Force (1995-2006). The Arkansas native was a captain on Frank Broyles' first Razorbacks team in 1958 and made early coaching stops at Virginia Military (1962-63) and Georgia Tech (1964-67).\n\nHe worked under College Football Hall of Fame coaches Bobby Dodd and Fisher DeBerry at Georgia Tech and Air Force, respectively, and alongside Hall of Fame coach Bobby Bowden when Bowden was offensive coordinator at West Virginia.\n\nBefore leaving Georgia, Bell recruited a young defensive back named Kirby Smart.\n\n\"He just knew how to get the most out of every player,\" Cones said, \"and he had some really, really good pep talks. He was such a professional in terms of communicating, and you'd get really pumped up when he's your coach. He had a certain charisma about him. He would say the right thing, the things you wanted to hear before you went out to win a game for him.\"\n\nFormer Tech defensive tackle David Knaus described Bell as calm, controlled, thorough and confident. Knaus, an all-Southwest Conference honoree in 1973, said Bell's style was a polar opposite of Bill Parcells, who followed him as Tech defensive coordinator.\n\n\"Other than both of them being tremendous coaches, they couldn't have been more different in their styles,\" Knaus said. \"As an example, I never heard profanity ever uttered from coach Bell. He barely ever needed to raise his voice. It was always controlled correction.\"\n\nTech went 8-4 in 1970, holding opponents to 13.5 points per game. The Red Raiders slipped to 4-7 in 1971, though the defense yielded only 12.5 points per game, and defensive back Marc Dove was Southwest Conference defensive player of the year. Bell's units held opponents to 14.2 points per game in 1972, 15.3 in 1973 and 13.8 in 1974.\n\nThe 1972 team finished 8-4 with a Sun Bowl loss to North Carolina. The 1973 team finished 11-1 with a Gator Bowl conquest of Tennessee.\n\nWhile serving as the Red Raiders' defensive coordinator, Bell was position coach for defensive ends and linebackers. End Bruce Dowdy earned all-Southwest Conference recognition in 1970, linebacker Larry Molinare in 1971 and Cones in 1974.\n\n\"He took a lot of running backs and good athletes,\" Baty said, \"and turned them into linebackers and defensive ends. That was kind of his way to do it. He liked a good athlete that would hit you.\"\n\nBaty came to Tech as a running back, quickly moved to linebacker and then played his entire varsity career at defensive end. Noseguard Don Rives was a second-team all-American in 1972. In the spring before that season, Rives called Baty \"the best defensive end in this league\" and \"the most underrated player in this conference.\"\n\nTo the extent that was true, Baty chalked it up to his coach.\n\n\"He made me as a player,\" Baty said. \"Not that I was anything special, but whatever I was is because of Richard Bell.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Lubbock Avalanche-Journal: Remembering Richard Bell, Texas Tech football defensive coordinator",

    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos rolled into Week 16 against the Jacksonville Jaguars riding an 11-game win streak with visions of clinching the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs.\n\nThe Jaguars had other ideas. Sparked by another big game from quarterback Trevor Lawrence, the Jaguars steamrolled the vaunted Broncos' defense in Denver to secure a 34-20 win.\n\nWith the win, the Jaguars improve to 11-4 while turning the race for the No. 1 seed in the AFC into a five-team contest. The Broncos drop to 12-3, while the 11-4 Chargers, 11-4 Bills and 11-3 Patriots (ahead of Sunday night's game against the Ravens) all remain in the race for the first-round bye in the AFC playoff bracket.\n\nLawrence led the way while completing 23 of 36 passes for for 279 yards with 3 touchdowns and no interceptions. He added 20 yards and a fourth touchdown on the ground.\n\nThis, a week after Lawrence led a 48-20 romp over the Jets with 330 passing yards, 5 touchdowns and no turnovers. But that was against the Jets.\n\nSunday was against a Super Bowl-contending Broncos team with one of the best defenses in football. And if you weren't counting the Jaguars among Super Bowl contenders before, it's time to reconsider that stance.\n\nThe early portion of Sunday's contest was a back-and-forth affair that saw the Broncos tie the game at 17-17 early in the third quarter. But the tenor of the game took a dramatic shift on Jacksonville's first possession of the second half.\n\nSparked by a pair of big penalties, the Jaguars drove 75 yards for a touchdown. A roughing the passing penalty for bodyweight on a hit of Lawrence on first down moved the Jaguars across midfield and riled up the raucous Denver crowd.\n\nThen in the red zone on second down, the Broncos got flagged for pass interference in the end zone when Jahdae Barron grabbed Parker Washington's arm while the ball was in the air. This brought the home crowd into a frenzy.\n\nLawrence responded by running untouched into the end zone for 24-17 lead Jaguars lead.\n\nBack and forth we goooo@trevorlawrence | #JAXvsDEN on FOXpic.twitter.com/ySt0CgOLMW\n\n— Jacksonville Jaguars (@Jaguars) December 21, 2025\n\nThe Broncos had multiple chances to answer, but there was no Bo Nix magic in the second half this time.\n\nDenver punted after four plays on its ensuing possession. Following another Jaguars touchdown for a 31-17 lead, a botched handoff from Nix to Jaleel McLaughlin resulted in Denver's first turnover of the game. The Jaguars converted that fumble into a field goal for a 34-17 lead.\n\nThen with 8:08 remaining, Nix forced a sideline pass to Pat Bryant in tight coverage. Jarrian Jones was there for the interception to all but ice the Jacksonville win.\n\nBo Nix is intercepted by Jarrian Jones 👀\n\n📺 FOX pic.twitter.com/4pNMf0lkHU\n\n— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) December 21, 2025\n\nFor the day, Nix completed 28 of 47 passes for 352 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. He was credited with a lost fumble on the botched handoff in the third quarter. And the Jaguars finished the game with a 2-0 advantage in takeaways. Those turnovers ultimately tanked any hope of a Broncos comeback.\n\nEven with the loss, the Broncos maintain control of that No. 1 seed. Their 12-3 record remains alone atop the AFC. And they hold the tiebreaker over the Patriots if the Patriots win Sunday night.\n\nBut with two weeks remaining in the season, the race for that No. 1 seed is anything but settled. And the Chargers could still win the AFC West. The Broncos and Chargers will face off in Week 18, when the division title could be at stake.",

    "title": "Instant reaction: Broncos’ defense fizzles out as Jaguars route Denver 34-20",
    "description": "The Denver Broncos had their 11-game winning streak come to an end with their 34-20 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.",
    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos hosted the roaring Jacksonville Jaguars in their Week 16 matchup. A gridiron battle of two division leaders, this one was expected to be a close and hard-fought matchup. It turned out to be the opposite, with the Jaguars throttling the Broncos 34-20 and ending their 11-game winning streak. Here are some instant reactions and key takeaways from today’s game.\n\nPenalties, drops, and miscues plague Broncos’ offensive effort\n\nLast week against the Green Bay Packers, Bo Nix and the offense had one of their most complete games of the season. In order to defeat the Jaguars, they needed to replicate some of that success. Sadly, that was far from the case with only several good drives through sixty minutes of play.\n\nAfter struggling in the first quarter, they were able muster a quality scoring drive early on in the second quarter. A 15-yard fade to Courtland Sutton tied the game up. A few drives later, Wil Lutz was able to connect on a 54-yard field goal to give the Broncos a 10-7 lead—but that was short-lived with Denver being down 17-10 at halftime.\n\nDenver’s first drive of the second half couldn’t have gone any better. Rookie running back RJ Harvey broke a few tackles and dove for the pylon to cap off a 38-yard touchdown scamper that tied the game up at 17. It was an absolutely marvelous play by the second-round pick. After that? There wasn’t much to write home about.\n\nThree-and-outs and stalled drives were a theme for the Broncos thereafter. A failed handoff exchange between Nix and Jaleel McLaughlin late in the third quarter was the straw that broke the camel’s back with Denver already down 31-17. In the fourth quarter down 34-20, Nix threw an interception on fourth down that officially ended any hopes of a miracle comeback.\n\nPenalties, drops, turnovers, and miscues all played a culprit in the Broncos’ regression on offense against the Jaguars. Ther only bright spot on offense was Harvey’s performance. It was in a losing effort, but over 120 all-purpose yards and a touchdown is praiseworthy. The team will continue to need him to play at a high level in the final weeks of the season to help secure the division title and top seed in the AFC.\n\nJarrian Jones picks off Nix!\n\nJAXvsDEN on FOX/FOX Onehttps://t.co/HkKw7uXnxV pic.twitter.com/F9MjGz2RRZ\n\nDefense fails to show up in worst performance of the season\n\nThe Jaguars entered today’s contest averaging well over 30 points a game since their bye week. Both Trevor Lawrence and Travis Etienne were on hot streaks. It was a big task for the Broncos to slow them down. Unfortunately, they struggled all game long and had their worst performance of the year. It was ugly throughout four quarters.\n\nOne area of concern I had was how safety P.J. Locke would hold up in coverage. He surrendered a touchdown reception to tight end Brenton Strange in the second quarter—aided by a clear push off by Strange. However, he was also targeted often on the Jaguars’ scoring drive right before halftime and also in the second half. It’s clear that Brandon Jones’ presence in the backend of Denver’s secondary was sorely missed.\n\nOn top of that, Lawrence was able to light up the Broncos’ red zone defense. Entering today’s game, Denver’s red zone defense was best in the NFL in ‘25 and a huge strength. Today? They gave up four touchdowns in Jacksonville’s first four trips inside the 20. That’s certainly not a recipe for success. It was Murphy’s Law for the Broncos on defense this afternoon.\n\nMissed tackles, missed coverage assignments, and penalties hampered Denver’s ability to thwart Jacksonville’s offensive endeavors. The Jaguars were routinely able to create yards after the catch and blow past Broncos defenders. It’s been a long time since we have seen them play this poorly. But perhaps a wakeup call was eventually in order. It’s really not worth mentioning ‘elite’ and this defense in the same sentence any longer.\n\nAfter multiple weeks of showing concerning weaknesses, all of the Broncos’ biggest flaws were exposed today. With only two games remaining before the playoffs, the team doesn’t have long to correct them. If they can’t, their hopes of a strong postseason push may be in jeopardy. Defensive Coordinator Vance Joseph and his players have their work cut out for them.\n\nThis Bronco Defense is all kinds of out of sorts. \n\nBusting coverages, not setting edges, no QB player on obvious Zone Read situations. \n\nTrevor Lawrence & Liam Cohen continue to punch the bruise. \n\nThe Brandon Jones loss looms larger than I would have expected.\n\n— Coach Mike Sanford (@Coach_Sanford2) December 21, 2025\n\nDenver can’t let this loss linger. Recalibrate and beat the Chiefs on Christmas.\n\nAll good things come to an end. It’s been an awesome season for the Broncos, but their eleven-game winning streak is now over. Getting pummeled at home by the Jaguars wasn’t on the radar for me. I thought the Broncos would win in a close game.\n\nA huge credit to Jacksonville for being the better team today. They executed a great gameplan on both sides of the ball. They also delivered Denver their first loss at home since October of last season. That’s pretty wild when you think about it.\n\nThat being said, the Broncos can’t afford to dwell on this loss and let it linger. They need to shift gears quickly and be prepared to defeat the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium on Christmas. There usually isn’t a good way to spin a loss, but this sort of adversity might be important for the Broncos to experience before the postseason hits.\n\nIt can serve as a bit of a reality check for them. Moreover, it’s certainly a woeful performance where there will be ample tape to show what they need to correct and improve upon. The next two games are against division rivals. They are must-win games for Denver to win the AFC West and find a way to edge out the competition for that coveted first-round bye and homefield advantage that comes with the #1 seed.\n\nWill the Broncos be able to show some tenacity and resiliency over the next two weeks? I sure hope so. So much is at stake. Let’s hope they can finish off the season strong with back-to-back wins. Although it isn’t going to be easy, especially with Pat Bryant and Dre Greenlaw being injured late in today’s game.\n\nProbably a good time to note that the Broncos can lose today and still get the No. 1 seed with 2 wins.\n\nAnd also that every time they've won the SB they've had back-to-back December losses. (Not saying you want that here, because that means losing to a KC team w/ its No. 3 QB)\n\n— Andrew Mason (@MaseDenver) December 21, 2025",

    "fullText": "GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Bijan Robinson gained 171 yards from scrimmage and had a touchdown catch, Kirk Cousins threw two TD passes and ran for a score, and the Atlanta Falcons held on to beat the Arizona Cardinals 26-19 on Sunday.\n\nThe Falcons (6-9) won for the second straight week, with both coming on the road.\n\nArizona's defense made a fourth-down stop at its own 40-yard line with 2:05 left, setting up a chance to tie the game or take the lead, but Atlanta's C.J. Henderson made a diving interception of Jacoby Brissett's pass with 1:30 remaining to seal it.\n\nRobinson had 92 yards receiving on seven catches, including a 13-yard touchdown, and added 76 yards rushing on 16 carries. The 23-year-old became the third player in franchise history to gain at least 2,000 yards from scrimmage in a season, joining Jamal Anderson (1998) and William Andrews (1981 and 1983).\n\nArizona (3-12) has lost seven straight and 12 of 13 since starting the season 2-0.\n\nThe Falcons pushed ahead 26-16 early in the fourth quarter when Cousins scored on a 1-yard run, which capped a 12-play, 66-yard drive. Arizona cut the deficit to 26-19 with 4:37 left on Chad Ryland's 34-yard field goal, taking advantage of Cousins' fumble at midfield.\n\nBrissett completed 16 of 31 passes for 203 yards with a touchdown and an interception. The veteran has a 1-9 record as the Cardinals' starter since taking over for the injured Kyler Murray in Week 6.\n\nArizona tight end Elijah Higgins had 91 yards receiving on seven catches.\n\nAtlanta rallied from an early 10-point deficit to tie the game at 16-all heading into halftime. Cousins hit Kyle Pitts for an 11-yard touchdown with 25 seconds left in the second quarter. Calais Campbell, Arizona's 39-year-old defensive end, blocked the extra-point attempt to keep the Falcons from taking the lead.\n\nArizona tried a 50-yard field goal to take the lead just before the break, but Ryland's kick was no good, bouncing off the right upright.\n\nRyland also missed a 44-yard attempt in the third quarter wide right.\n\nThe Cardinals took a 10-0 lead midway through the first quarter after Michael Wilson made a circus catch for a 32-yard touchdown. Falcons cornerback Cobee Bryant and Wilson tumbled into the end zone as they fought for possession and the ball bounced between them, eventually settling between Wilson's legs without hitting the ground.\n\nCardinals: CB Max Melton (heel), LT Paris Johnson Jr. (knee) and S Jalen Thompson (hamstring) were among six inactives. ...

    "fullText": "ATLANTA (AP) — Trae Young is quickly returning to his All-Star form after missing 21 games with a knee injury.\n\nNow, the Atlanta Hawks can shift their focus to healing their ailing defense.\n\nThe Hawks ranked 22nd in scoring defense before Sunday's 152-150 loss to the Chicago Bulls in the NBA's highest-scoring game this season.\n\nThe Bulls had nine scorers in double figures, led by Matas Buzelis with 28 points. The Bulls' 152 points set a season high. They also set season highs with 41 assists, 57.6% field goal percentage and 47.6% 3-point shooting (20 of 42).\n\nYoung scored a season-high 35 points with nine assists. Jalen Johnson had 36 points with 11 rebounds and nine assists.\n\nThe Hawks also had Onyeka Okongwu score 23 points and Vit Krejci add 20. Young's encouraging showing and all the offense wasn't enough to overcome the leaky defense. The Bulls set another season high by scoring 83 points in the first half.\n\n“It’s kind of tough winning games when you give up 80 points in the first half,” Johnson said. “It’s kind of embarrassing in a sense. …. Hopefully we cut down on some of the things we’re doing.”\n\nThe Hawks (15-15) have lost three straight and seven of nine to fall back to .500.\n\nYoung started for the second time in three games after missing 21 games with a right MCL sprain.\n\n“I think everybody is excited to have Trae back,” Johnson said. “He’s been out for a while. ... The fact he’s found his rhythm already in his second game is a good sign.”\n\nCoach Quin Snyder said Young may need more time before he's ready to play back-to-back games.\n\nYoung logged 26 minutes against Chicago, which he said was his limit for his second game back.\n\n“I feel amazing,” Young said. “They did their job, put me right at 26 minutes. They weren’t allowing me to do any more. ... I feel great.”\n\nYoung led the NBA in assists last season and is a four-time All-Star. He scored only eight points in 20 minutes in his first game back, a 133-126 loss at Charlotte on Thursday night. He was back in his high-scoring form against Chicago but missed a last-second jumper that would have tied the game.\n\n“Those are shots that he makes,\" Snyder said. “You feel good about getting the ball in the right guy’s hands.”\n\nSnyder said the Hawks “had a lot of breakdowns in execution” on defense in the first half. The Bulls scored 69 points in the second half and made 54.3% of their shots from the field, but Snyder said his defense “did a better job with that in the second half as far as making them work hard.”\n\nYoung said the high-scoring pace was no surprise.\n\n“It’s how both teams play,” Young said. \"Both teams play fast. Teams are coming in here and playing fast against us. We’ve got to figure out how to stop a team that can only play fast.'\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

    "fullText": "All eyes are on Myles Garrett this week as he is 1.5 sacks away from claiming the all-time NFL sack single-season record. He will be chasing that record this week, but beyond Garrett, the Cleveland Browns defense will be a huge factor in the game against the Buffalo Bills.\n\nWhile sacks will be a priority for Garrett, it is known that Josh Allen can extend plays with his legs, so the Cleveland pass rushers will need to prioritize limiting him in these situations rather than just aiming for sacks. If they can keep Allen in the pocket, they may be able to limit Buffalo’s explosive offense.\n\nThe Bills are built to score often and quickly, so limiting explosive plays will be crucial for the Browns’ defense. There needs to be an emphasis on tackling and limiting big gains that will allow Buffalo to move down the field quickly. Cleveland’s offense struggles when playing from behind, making it crucial for the defense to avoid putting the team in that situation.\n\nIn every game, third-down stops and stops in the red zone are always a key to keeping the Browns in games, and it is no different for this game. Limiting the Bills to field goals and forcing them to punt will keep the Browns competitive.\n\nLet me know what you think in the comments – What are the keys for the Browns defense in limiting the Bills offense?",
