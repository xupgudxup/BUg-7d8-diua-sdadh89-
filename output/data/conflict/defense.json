    "description": "Defense One first reported that the funding for those checks actually comes from reconciliation funds that were approved by Congress to subsidize housing allowances for service members.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is already facing backlash for his so-called “warrior dividend” he announced during his national address on Wednesday night.\n\nTrump announced that 1.45 million military servicemembers will be receiving a $1,776 check ahead of Christmas as a result of tariff revenue and his “big beautiful bill” signed earlier this year. But skeptics immediately questioned how Trump was able to authorize sending out individual checks to service members without approval from Congress.\n\n“1,450,000 military service members will receive a special, we call warrior dividend before Christmas, a warrior dividend. In honor of our nation’s founding in 1776, we are sending every soldier $1,776. Think of that. And the checks are already on the way,” Trump said during his speech.\n\n“We made a lot more money than anybody thought because of tariffs, and the bill helped us along. Nobody deserves it more than our military. And I say congratulations to everybody. And by the way, we now have record enlistment in our military, and last year we had among the worst recruitment numbers in our military’s history. What a difference a year makes,” he added.\n\nHowever, online publication Defense One first reported that the funding for those checks actually comes from reconciliation funds that were approved by Congress to subsidize housing allowances for service members.\n\nA senior administration official told Defense One that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed the Pentagon “disburse $2.6 billion as a one-time basic allowance for housing supplement” to all eligible service members.\n\n“Congress appropriated $2.9 billion to the Department of War to supplement the Basic Allowance for Housing entitlement within The One Big Beautiful Bill,” the senior official told Defense One in a statement. “Approximately 1.28 million active component military members and 174,000 Reserve component military members will receive this supplement.”\n\nOVERNIGHT: President Trump’s $1,776 checks for 1.45 million troops announced Wednesday night come from Congressionally-allocated reconciliation funds intended to subsidize housing allowances for service members, a senior official confirmed to @DefenseOne.https://t.co/mGWski9Exl\n\n— Thomas Novelly (@TomNovelly) December 18, 2025\n\nThe report immediately sparked criticism on social media platform X.\n\n“I was wondering how Trump found his troop pay money without a congressional authorization/appropriation. He found it by taking it away from troop housing money. Always a con artist,” The Atlantic’s David Frum wrote on X.\n\nFormer Rep. Joe Walsh wrote: “Classic Trump. Everything he does is a lie, everything he does is just bullshit repackaging.”\n\nMeidasTouch editor-in-chief Ron Filipkowski posted: “Trump is taking money out their housing allowances approved by Congress and giving it to them in a ‘bonus’ so it looks like it came from him. It’s just a shell game with military pay from the ultimate con man.”\n\nNew Jersey Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D) said the “warrior dividend” is “no more than rebranded military housing allowances.”\n\n“Trump isn’t giving our brave service members a bonus, he’s just shuffling around money so he can claim he is. The level of disrespect for the intelligence of our troops is staggering,” she wrote on X.\n\nU.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), a veteran, also bashed Trump’s announcement.\n\n“Gee thanks, Donald. Your $1,776 ‘warrior checks’ aren’t Christmas bonuses—you’re just stealing money out of a fund meant to help our troops find affordable housing. Once a conman always a conman,\" Duckworth wrote.",

    "fullText": "After a whole month of controversy with former head coach Lane Kiffin, the Ole Miss Rebels are finally back on the playing field, hoping to continue the best season in program history.\n\nThey face a familiar matchup this weekend against a Tulane team that they blew out 45-10 earlier this year, and should cruise through their first round College Football Playoff game on Saturday.\n\nThey’re a significant favorite and deservedly so. They outgained the Green Wave by nearly 250 yards in the first matchup, while completely shutting down their passing attack. Offensively, Trinidad Chambliss and Co. were dominant, throwing for over 300 yards while getting 241 more on the ground.\n\nOle Miss scored on eight of its first nine possessions, and Tulane just had no answers defensively. But, the blowout win did show a glaring concern: Ole Miss’s run defense.\n\nThe Rebels could not contain the Tulane ground game, as the Green Wave went for 178 yards on 4.6 yards per carry. And that wasn’t a one-game problem.\n\nAfter being a dominant force up front in 2024, ranking first in rushing yards allowed per game (85.1) and in yards allowed per carry (2.4), Ole Miss has significantly slipped this season. They rank 71st in rushing yards allowed per game (157.1), while being 92nd in yards allowed per carry (4.7).\n\nNow, the issue hasn’t shown up as much this year because Ole Miss’s offense has been elite, and the pass defense has been a top-30 unit in the country this year.\n\nBut, in Ole Miss’s close games this season, they struggled to defend the run. Against Kentucky early in the year, they allowed 172 rushing yards and 4.6 yards per carry. Arkansas went for 221 yards and four scores on six yards per carry in Ole Miss’s 41-35 win. Washington State had 127 yards on 4.5 yards a carry. Oklahoma went for 136 yards and two scores on nearly five yards a carry.\n\nThen, there’s Georgia, who went for 221 yards and a touchdown on the ground in Ole Miss’s lone loss of the year. And that’s who the Rebels will play in the second round of the Playoff, assuming they beat Tulane.\n\nNow, the Rebels are still a stellar 11-1 in the SEC. They’ve managed to win behind that elite defense and good pass defense. And they should run through Tulane this weekend, whose defense can’t keep up with Ole Miss.\n\nBut, if there’s a reason why Ole Miss’s magical season might end earlier than fans hope, it’s the run defense, which can certainly be a prevalent issue against the top teams in the country.",

    "description": "Wind is going to be a factor. So is the multiple defense coach Mike Macdonald will have against Sean McVay’s Rams offense.",
    "fullText": "Biggest game of the year. Biggest game yet for Sam Darnold with his Seahawks.\n\nWhat’s Seattle’s quarterback doing to prepare best for the Los Angeles Rams and this NFC West Battle Royale Thursday night at Lumen Field for the division lead and inside track to the top seed plus bye in next month’s conference playoffs?\n\n“To be honest, I’m not up all-night studying,” Darnold said of the three days between the Seahawks’ win over Indianapolis and this showdown between two 11-3 teams. “It’s making sure that I get my sleep, get my recovery in, because it is such a short week.”\n\nThere could be a lot for Darnold to study, in an effort to spring surprises on the Rams.\n\nYet Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald and offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak have spent this week balancing installing new plays in the game plan the Rams haven’t seen on film this season versus not overloading Seattle’s players with too much. The coaches want their Seahawks to play fast, to not think about too much new they crammed into the players’ heads Monday into Thursday this week. The Seahawks — and the Rams, for that matter — have been practicing plays for weeks if not months they’ve yet to use in a game, to surprise their opponent with new looks in the first Thursday night in NFL history feature two teams with 11 or more wins.\n\nThat’s the first key to this game: Be new, but while playing fast.\n\n“I think you could use it to your advantage,” Macdonald said of the short week. “If you’re decisive in how you want to operate and they’re the right decisions, I think that’ll help you. Sometimes, it might be behind the 8-ball.\n\n“A kick in the butt doesn’t necessarily hurt you.”\n\nSo what’s the new that will be key Thursday night?\n\nLook for Macdonald to use the combination of rookie Nick Emmanwori at all three levels of the defense with Pro Bowl cornerback Devon Witherspoon blitzing more and Seattle’s recent three-cornerback rotation with Riq Woolen and Josh Jobe giving the Seahawks new personnel options against coach Sean McVay’s Rams offense.\n\nNo team in the league plays in “13” personnel — one running back, three tight ends — more than McVay’s Rams, 25% of the time; the league average is 5%. No team played the Rams’ “13” personnel with nickel and an extra, fifth defensive back more than the Seahawks did last month in L.A.’s 21-19 home win.\n\nRams No. 2 wide receiver Davante Adams, the NFL’s leader with 14 touchdown receptions, is doubtful to play because of an injured hamstring. That may lead McVay to even more “13” personnel sets.\n\nThe Rams average 6.1 yards per play in their three-tight ends formations this season. Against Macdonald’s Seahawks last month L.A. got just 2.7 yards in McVay’s “13” personnel.\n\nIn all formations, Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford had by one measure the worst game of his 17-year NFL career last month against Seattle. His expected points added (EPA) passing in that game was the lowest of his career.\n\nMcVay’s offense had its lowest EPA in two seasons last month against Macdonald’s Seahawks defense. Can Seattle do it again?\n\nThe weather is forecast to be conducive to running over throwing the ball: A 50% chance of rain with winds 15 mph gusting toward 35 mph around the 5:15 p.m. kickoff, then throughout the game.\n\n“Yeah, it’ll factor into some of the decisions that we make,” Macdonald said, grinning to conceal exactly which ones.\n\nKubiak has shown he’s going to run the ball, regardless of the results. Seattle gained just 49 yards last week against the Colts, a top-10 run defense in the NFL. Yet the Seahawks ran it 22 times. No team in the league comes close to running it as often as Seattle’s 48% of all offensive plays. Yet the Seahawks are fifth-to-last with just 3.9 yards per rush.\n\nLast week, they ran for a season low 2.3 yards per carry against Indianapolis.\n\nThe Rams are ninth in the league in rushing defense.\n\n“I think it’s got to improve pretty quick,” Kubiak said of the Seahawks running game.\n\n“We’ve got to move the ball better on the ground. We’ve got to coach better. We’ve got to block better. We’ve got to help the operation by being a more balanced team.”\n\nExpect a pointed effort by Kubiak handing the ball to lead back Kenneth Walker early and often. Walker had 2.4 yards per rush in the last two games (19 carries, 46 yards). He’s had defenders standing waiting for him in the backfield immediately as he receives handoffs from Darnold.\n\nThursday, Walker is going to be running behind a new left tackle: Josh Jones is making his first Seattle start, for injured Charles Cross.\n\nThe Seahawks drove inside the Rams’ 20-yard line four times in that November game in Inglewood, California. They got just one touchdown out of those four red-zone trips.\n\nLast week against the Colts the Seahawks were 0 for 2 scoring TDs in the red zone. Seattle’s offensive moved inside the Indianapolis 35 four times. Yet the only offense was a team-record six field goals by Jason Myers in the 18-16 escape win.\n\nFor the season, the Seahawks are in the bottom half of the NFL, 17th in the 32-team league, in red-zone TD percentage (57.5%). They’ve been just 37.5% the last three weeks, the fourth-worst in the NFL in that span.\n\nMinimize penalties. Eliminate negative plays. And of course be far better than the career-high four interceptions Darnold threw in the last game against the Rams, handing L.A. two of their three touchdowns.\n\nThe Seahawks must score touchdowns, seven points, instead of field goals when they get close against L.A.\n\n“Again, the last few games moving the ball up and down the field, I feel like we’ve been solid,” Darnold said. “Third downs can improve a little bit— or a lot, I think I should say. Then in the red zone, it’s a matter of keeping the ball moving forward.\n\n“When you get in those second and long, third and longs, that makes it hard to convert. So, just keeping the ball moving forward, not only in the red zone, but also in the field, as well.”\n\nYes, this is one of the biggest regular-season games Seattle’s played in a minute. The winner is two more wins from the NFC West title and home-field plus a bye in the conference playoffs, meaning two home postseason games from the Super Bowl. The loser is headed to the fifth seed, and needing to win three road playoff games to reach the Super Bowl.\n\nYet the Seahawks coach doesn’t see it in that lens.\n\n“Look, I get it. It’s your job to put all the meaning behind it,” Macdonald said.\n\n“It’s our job to go play great football.\n\n“It’s all good, and I get it. It’s exciting. But every game’s exciting.” Darnold doesn’t turn the ball over. Walker gets (some) more than he’s gotten recently on the ground. Macdonald’s defense again stymies McVay’s offense with new tricks.",

    "fullText": "Palmer Luckey wants you to know he was right all along.\n\nThe outspoken billionaire and new-age god of war is making a fortune selling weapons. His reach extends beyond the range of his powerful artillery though, as he has shifted the narrative around what working in defense tech means.\n\nOnce a somewhat taboo corner of the business world, the success of Luckey's Anduril Industries, along with his no-holds-barred approach to … just about everything, has made him the poster child for tech's new love affair with the military, writes BI's Julia Hornstein.\n\nLuckey's now on a victory lap of sorts as he shepherds the US into a new era where one of the biggest business battlefields is the literal battlefield.\n\nPart of Luckey's appeal in tech circles might be his authenticity.\n\nWhether you love him or hate him, the 33-year-old has stuck to his guns over the years. That's unlike most of his tech peers, who have shifted their businesses and policies to favor whichever political party is in power. (Luckey once said he wrote President Donald Trump a letter when he was 15, encouraging him to run for president.)\n\nAt times, that dedication has come at a cost. Luckey has long claimed he was fired from Meta in 2017 for supporting Trump. Meta denies he left over politics.\n\nBut these days it's all sunshine and rainbows cruise missiles and drones for Luckey.\n\nPalmer Luckey might be the face of defense tech, but he's got plenty of competition.\n\nFirst and foremost, there's more money than ever in the space thanks to the Trump administration leaning into defense spending.\n\nThe latest era of modern warfare is also creating new opportunities. The increased prominence of drones, as evident in the war in Ukraine, has given startups a chance to step up to the plate. It has created an interesting dynamic, with young, agile startups competing with traditional defense contractors.\n\nThe increased competition is largely viewed as a positive for the government, which can benefit from better pricing. The new players and cutting-edge tech are also speeding up processes.\n\nThe Navy said a Palantir-powered AI system for shipbuilding cut a 160-hour job to just 10 minutes. The Army is also enacting a \"fail fast\" approach to weapon development.\n\nMoving at such speed, a staple of Silicon Valley, comes with risks when dealing with such powerful and dangerous tech. A new watchdog report said the US military needs to improve its weapons testing processes.",

He made the move to the college game in 2023, serving as the defensive coordinator at UCLA for one season and at USC for the past two. In both cases, he took over horrendous units and improved them mightily right away. Below is where the Bruins and Trojans defenses ranked in SP+ before Lynn’s arrival and then during his tenure.\n\nBefore D’Anton Lynn: UCLA (2022) — 83rd\nDuring D’Anton Lynn: UCLA (2023 — 17th\n\nBefore D’Anton Lynn:USC (2023) — 105th\nDuring D’Anton Lynn: USC (2024) — 48th\nDuring D’Anton Lynn: USC (2025) — 35th\n\nAt Penn State, he wouldn’t be taking over a dreadful unit — the Nittany Lions, even in a down defensive season, finished 33rd in SP+. But there’s still the element of a lot of transition with NFL departures and potential transfer portal movement that bringing in someone like Lynn who gets improved results right away would be an awesome fit.\n\nSo the guy is good. Really good. And it’d be quite the hire for Matt Campbell to get him just 12 months after the last guy got turned down.\n\nD’Anton Lynn was asked last week why he stayed on as USC’s DC after Penn State, his alma mater, pursued him. \n\nLynn: “I just couldn’t imagine myself coaching anybody else.”\n\n“The people we have here, it was just too tough to leave.”\n\n— Ryan Kartje (@RyanKartje) May 5, 2025\n\nWe’ll see where this goes.

    "description": "Jarred Vanderbilt sparked the Lakers' defensive effort in the win over Phoenix on Sunday, but they'll need their stars to contribute as well against Utah.",
    "fullText": "They saw how “contagious” it was when playing defense at a high level against the Suns and how Jarred Vanderbilt lit the fuse to ignite things for the Lakers in their last victory over Phoenix.\n\nAnd for the Lakers to maintain that defensive mindset, stars Luka Doncic and LeBron James also have to be committed to that end of the court.\n\nThat was the message from Lakers coach JJ Redick to Doncic and James.\n\n\"Yeah, it was good,\" Doncic said. \"We talked about a lot, not just that, but he was right. You got to get a little big more, especially from the star players. So that's on us. That's on me. And we just got to give more, especially at the start of the game. We got to start the game better. But I think in Phoenix, we did a pretty good job. The plan was focused on ourselves and [our] defensive mentality, so I think we did a pretty good job.\"\n\nThe Lakers will be tested again on defense by the Utah Jazz Thursday night in Salt Lake City.\n\nThe Jazz have a developing star in Lauri Markkanen, a difficult matchup at 7-foot-1 who is ninth in the NBA in scoring at 27.8 points per game, and a young talent in guard Keyonte George, who is averaging 23.5 points and 6.8 assists.\n\nUtah is fourth in the league in pace (102.98), ninth in scoring (119.0), second in assists (29.8). The Jazz are fifth in rebounds (45.7), eighth in offensive rebounds (12.6), and 12th in field-goal percentage.\n\n\"The way we play, we got to approach every game the same,\" Doncic said. \"In the NBA, every team is dangerous, so at some point somebody can go for 40. They have Markkanen, and then George. They can go for 40 on any night. So we just got to work on ourselves and approach the game, make everything the same.\"\n\nThe all-out energy and effort by Vanderbilt off the bench was the catalyst for the Lakers against the Suns.\n\nIn his 15 minutes of action, he had seven ponits, seven rebounds, two steals and one blocked shot.\n\nVanderbilt had played only three minutes and eight seconds over a 10-game stretch prior to that point.\n\n“Vando's minutes were huge,” Gabe Vincent said. “He came in and does what we all know he's very capable of doing and being disruptive on the defensive end, crashing the glass, getting extra possessions for us, all of which we desperately needed. You know what I mean? So his spark off the bench was huge for us.\"\n\nNow it’s about sustaining that defensive intensity, the Lakers say. And about playing with that physicality, the Lakers say.\n\n“Yeah, when you guys asked me this the last time, it’s effort,” Jake LaRavia said. “If we just go out there and we give that kind of effort every night…We got a lot of guys on the team. Some guys might not be having it and, like you said about that contagious word, that really helps out. (Marcus) Smart does it sometimes. Vando does it sometimes. I would say I do it just being a contagious type of person to help lead the team and just being extra physical.”\n\nThe Lakers are ranked near the bottom of the league in some defensive categories, which means there remains room for improvement.\n\nThey are ranked 17th in the league in points allowed (116.7), 24th in field-goal percentage (48.1%) allowed and 28th in three-point shooting (38.1%) allowed.\n\n“You just got to go out there and do it,” LaRavia said. “It’s not anything a coach can say. It’s not anything a player can tell another player. Yeah, it’s like the individual player’s job to go out there and give effort on defense and that’s contagious. It just goes around.”\n\nLakers center Deandre Ayton on Wednesday was named by the NBA and the National Basketball Players Assn. as the winner of the Bob Lanier Community Assist Award for November. Ayton was recognized for his philanthropic work across the Bahamas, which is his home country, Jamaica and Los Angeles through the Ayton Family Foundation.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "MIAMI, Fla. — Thursday, Cardinal Newman (West Palm Beach) pulled off one of the biggest upsets of the 2025 FHSAA state championships. The Crusaders took down four-time defending state champions Chaminade-Madonna (Hollywood) in a 17-14 victory.\n\nThe leader of the Newman defense was three-star LB Adam Balogoun-Ali, who ended his high school career in the best possible way.\n\n“There’s no better way to end it,” Balogoun-Ali said after the win. “It’s not even a bittersweet feeling—just pure joy. I love my guys. I’m so glad we could get this done.”\n\nChaminade was the favorite going into the game, but Newman proved that any team can win on any given day.\n\n“It’s just a jersey. It’s just a name. They’re not the same team that they were. We knew if we came in and punched them in the mouth, we could win this game, and that’s what happened.”\n\nThe Benjamin School transfer feels he’s grown exponentially in his senior year at Newman and credits head coach Jack Daniels with instilling a culture that laid the foundation for the school’s first state championship.\n\n“This is a more complicated defense. I would say the biggest thing I learned was how to take in all the info really fast, especially when [offenses] are going quickly, as Chaminade did. I think learning the [college] playbook will be much easier now that I’ve come to Newman this year.\n\n“Coach Jack Daniels ‘ culture that he set at Cardinal Newman is superb. It’s unlike anything I’ve been a part of, and I’m really glad could learn from it.”\n\nAhead of the state title game, the Auburn signee received some motivational words from the newly formed Tiger staff.\n\n“The whole staff has been really supportive. They were telling me it’s just another game and to do me.”\n\nAuburn defensive coordinator DJ Durkin, who was instrumental in landing Balogoun-Ali’s signing, was retained by the program, much to the delight of the Tiger signee.\n\n“This is why I went to Auburn. I want to be coached by him. I really believe in what he does development-wise and scheme-wise. I think we are going to do great things over there at Auburn.”\n\nThe 6-foot-1, 210-pound backer is confident with his signing with Auburn and believes in what new head coach Alex Golesh is building on the Plains.\n\n“There was a lot of doubt about where people were going and all that, but personally, with me, I’m excited. I think it’s going to be a good time. With Coach Golesh as our new head coach, I think our offense will get going a lot, and our defense is already elite. I think in one or two years we’ll be a top team.”",

    "description": "The Marine Air Defense Integration System, or MADIS, is in full production after trainings, live-fire exercises, and upgrades.",
    "fullText": "The Marine Corps has a new air defense system built to transform light vehicles into mobile weapons for shooting down drones and other aircraft.\n\nThe technology is intended to equip Marines with a new way to deal with drones and other aerial threats, the service announced this week. As the war in Ukraine has shown, the ability to counter these types of threats is critical in modern conflict.\n\nThe new Marine Air Defense Integration System, or MADIS, entered full-rate production earlier this fall after training and live-fire exercises. Placed on top of a pair of Joint Light Tactical Vehicles, MADIS converts the vehicles into a single short-ranged ground-based air defense system.\n\nThe vehicles work together, with one focused on countering drones and the other geared toward helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. MADIS uses Stinger missiles and a 30mm cannon for those targets, and it also comes with radars and electronic warfare systems. Marines can also use MADIS while on the move, giving the service a mobile air defense option.\n\nIt's a capability boost over the service's Man-Portable Air Defense System, or MANPAD, which Marines would've had to equip themselves and leave vehicles to use. MADIS is also capable of being upgraded over time, depending on what types of threats Marines are facing and what weapons they need for specific missions.\n\nMADIS, developed by the Norwegian firm Kongsberg Defense & Aerospace, has undergone several iterations since its initial prototype. The Marine Corps said its full-rate production version has sensors, algorithms, and mobility that allow Marines to locate, target, and destroy threats faster and better than before. Its first live-fire exercise took place during joint US-Philippine military training earlier this year.\n\nMarine Corps officials have said MADIS fills a gap in their air defense arsenal and is unique because it can complete the entire kill chain. Marines can use it to find and identify targets and then take them out rather than relying on several systems to do the same.\n\nMADIS also addresses Marine Corps concerns around how to defeat small uncrewed aerial systems in a potential future war.\n\nSince MADIS is mobile, it gives Marines a new way to defend forward-deployed forces — especially in a potential future fight against a sophisticated adversary like China.\n\nAs the Marine Corps reshapes its force for operations across the first island chain, from Japan to Taiwan to the Philippines, it needs systems that can move quickly and deliver more firepower against a wide range of aerial threats.",

    "description": "The Defense Department wants troops to have new weapons quickly. But testing processes don't include the best ways to do that, a new report documents.",
    "fullText": "The Pentagon wants to get troops new weapons faster, but its testing isn't following best practices, according to a new government watchdog report.\n\nCurrent policies have often focused on looking for problems after weapons are already developed, slowing down the process. Policy changes, the report concluded, would ultimately help the Department of Defense achieve the speed and modernization it is looking for.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office said the Pentagon needed to get testers involved early on, conduct iterative testing to find problems quickly and results in gradual changes, use digital twins to mirror actual physical systems, and seek regular user feedback.\n\nThese are key principles followed by companies for product development and they are applicable to the US military as it seeks to update its policies for faster, better weapons. Currently, GAO reporting indicates, the DoD implementation appears haphazard and sloppy.\n\nFor example, the development of the Air Force's new pilot training aircraft, the T-7A Red Hawk, didn't include allowing testers to access test data in a timely manner, and the contract didn't require a complete digital system model of system. And upgrades for the F-22 Raptor haven't considered how user feedback could be incorporated into an iterative testing process.\n\nWithout revising these development and design policies, \"the Air Force is missing opportunities to ensure that testing proceeds expeditiously and that the systems under test are responsive and relevant to warfighter needs,\" the GAO said.\n\nIn the Army, the new MV-75 Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft, which will eventually replace the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter, hasn't followed an iterative design approach. That could've resulted in tailoring testing to different changes in the aircraft's development, which could've gotten the system to pilots quicker, the watchdog office determined.\n\nAnd then the Navy, the GAO report said, only followed an iterative design process on its Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers for cybersecurity and didn't have a digital twin.\n\nReviews of the Department of Defense policies ultimately led the GAO to issue 13 recommendations, including that officials revise how they evaluate weapons and align their plans with better practices. The GAO said the Pentagon fully agreed with seven of those, partially agreed with five, and didn't concur with one.\n\nThe Pentagon did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nBroadly, the defense department faces a choice, the report concluded. \"On the one hand, it could continue to treat test and evaluation as a means of identifying deficiencies in weapon systems already developed and, often, already produced,\" it said. That wouldn't require any changes to the status quo but wouldn't help the Pentagon get weapons to troops faster.\n\n\"On the other hand, DoD has an opportunity to embrace test and evaluation as a core foundation of every weapon systems acquisition program,\" the GAO report added, which would be a significant change in the short term but position the department to \"ensure that warfighter needs are consistently understood, prioritized, and met\" in the long term.\n\nHow the Pentagon builds weapons is undergoing a shift as department leadership under the Trump administration seeks to speed up the process and get new technologies to troops quickly. Last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a memo directing the department to modernize its testing, reduce test oversight, and streamline requirements.\n\n\"Speed to capability delivery is now our organizing principle: the decisive factor in maintaining deterrence and warfighting advantage,\" Hegseth wrote.\n\nEarlier this year, Hegseth gutted the Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, which independently supervises the performance of weapons before they're given to US military personnel, decreasing the number of programs it oversees.\n\nHegseth said the cuts reduced bureaucracy and allowed for more rapid deployment of new weapons. Oversight experts, however, raised concerns that the cuts to DOT&E could put troops in danger and mean problems aren't identified before they hit the field.",

    "fullText": "Senate Republicans are growing increasingly uneasy with the Pentagon’s investigation into Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced his office is escalating its probe into him.\n\nThe Defense Department announced Monday the review of Kelly has risen to an “official Command Investigation,” intensifying the feud between the two sides over Kelly’s role in a video he and other congressional Democrats made to remind service members of their duty to disobey illegal orders.\n\nThe news has also given a number of Republicans pause as they question whether this is a prudent decision by the Pentagon against one of their colleagues.\n\n“I think it’s a terrible idea,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said.\n\nPaul was one of five Senate GOP members who expressed reservations about the Hegseth-led investigation into Kelly, a retired Navy captain.\n\nKelly has been under fire by the administration for nearly a month after he, Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) and Democratic Reps. Jason Crow (Colo.), Chris Deluzio (Pa.), Maggie Goodlander (N.H.) and Chrissy Houlahan (Pa.) appeared in the video that set off the series of comments.\n\nTrump also called for the execution of the half-dozen lawmakers — a remark he walked back.\n\nDays after the Democrats released the joint video, the Defense Department said it received “serious allegations of misconduct” against Kelly and that it kicked off a “thorough review” of the allegations. Hegseth ordered the Navy to finish the review and submit it to the Defense Department by Dec. 10.\n\nThe Navy submitted the report on potential punishments against Kelly to the department’s Office of General Counsel last week. The content and the scope of the report are unclear.\n\nWhat isn’t being walked back is the probe, which some Senate Republicans believe likely does not have merit.\n\n“I’m not,” Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said when asked whether she is comfortable with the expansion of the probe. “He is protected by the speech and debate clause.”\n\nHegseth appeared Tuesday on Capitol Hill alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio to brief lawmakers on the administration’s targeting of boats near Venezuela. Hegseth and Kelly got into a “long back-and-forth” during the briefing, according to Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.).\n\nAccording to one Senate Republican, the spat started with a reasonable question on Kelly’s end but eventually turned into a protracted discussion with GOP members complaining he was “filibustering” during a classified briefing when other attendees had questions.\n\nKelly said Hegseth brought up “talking points” about the video when he was asking the Pentagon chief about the strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.\n\n“I think, with regards to me, [Hegseth] kind of walked in there with a little speech that he wanted to give,” Kelly said after the briefing, adding, “I’m not going to waste my colleagues’ time with something that is specific to me.”\n\nKelly told reporters following the briefing the Pentagon still has not reached out to him about the investigation and argued the department is targeting him “for something I said that was lawful.”\n\n“This is all a bunch of bulls‑‑‑, and the reason why, I think, is because this is just about sending a message to retired service members, active duty service members, government employees: Do not speak out against this president, or there will be consequences,” he said.\n\nPaul Fishman, Kelly’s lawyer, warned that action by the Pentagon against the Democrat “would be unconstitutional and an extraordinary abuse of power.”\n\n“If the executive branch were to move forward in any forum — criminal, disciplinary, or administrative — we will take all appropriate legal action on Senator Kelly’s behalf to halt the Administration’s unprecedented and dangerous overreach,” Fishman wrote.\n\nWhen reached for comment, the Pentagon said it did not have further remarks and referred The Hill to Monday’s statement.\n\nSenate GOP members are concerned Hegseth’s actions are setting a precedent that could boomerang on Republicans.\n\n“These members are going to be here after this administration’s gone. We’re creating a precedent that everybody should expect could be used against them,” one GOP senator told The Hill.\n\n“Yeah — he made a video,” they continued. “But I don’t think it rises to the level that they’re trying to make it. It really seems to me like vindictive prosecutions, and that’s a bad message to send to the American people.”\n\nKelly is the only one of the six lawmakers who falls under the Defense Department’s purview. Four of the others are former military members but are not retired like Kelly is. Slotkin is an ex-CIA official.\n\nEven some Republicans who are more ardent supporters of the president indicated they have questions about whether the investigation is warranted.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters he didn’t believe taking part in the video was “very wise” on Kelly’s part.\n\n“But I don’t know if it broke any laws,” he added.\n\nSen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), a retired Marine, similarly criticized Kelly’s participation. Nevertheless, he cautioned he believes the investigation is not a “good use of the Pentagon’s time.”\n\n“While Senator Sullivan believes the message in the video was irresponsible and politically driven, he does not believe it is a good use of the Pentagon’s time to investigate Senator Kelly — who served honorably in the Navy — under the UCMJ [Uniform Code of Military Justice], particularly given that the Constitution’s Speech or Debate Clause would likely take precedence over any UCMJ provision,” a spokesperson for Sullivan said in a statement.\n\n“Such an investigation has the potential to turn into a major distraction for our military,” they continued. “After four years of Biden’s woke military, the Department of War needs to stay laser focused on lethality and war fighting.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is planning an executive order that would limit dividends, buybacks and executive pay for defense contractors whose projects are over-budget and delayed, according to three ​sources briefed on the order.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and the Pentagon have been complaining about the expensive, slow-moving and entrenched ‌nature of the defense industry, promising dramatic changes that would make the production of war equipment more nimble.\n\nIndustry groups have been on high alert about the ‌closely-held proposal, which is tied to a Treasury Department initiative, two of the sources said.\n\nA White House official said: \"Until officially announced by the White House, discussion about potential executive orders is purely speculation.\"\n\nShares ⁠of Lockheed fell 1.6% and Northrop Grumman sank ‌2% in after-hours trading after some aspects of the news were first reported by online political news service Punchbowl.\n\nDEFENSE FIRMS OFTEN BUY BACK SHARES\n\nShare buybacks are common among defense firms, and several pay a ‍dividend. Lockheed in October, for example, raised its dividend for the 23rd year in a row, to $3.45 per share. At the same time, it authorized the purchase of up to $2 billion of its shares, raising the total amount promised for repurchases to $9.1 billion.\n\nLockheed's F-35 fighter jet, one of ​the most expensive U.S. defense programs, has been plagued by rising costs and delays. Many big defense programs take much longer ‌to deliver a product than initially promised and at a far higher price.\n\nThe $140 billion Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile program that will replace aging Minuteman III missiles, designed and managed by Northrop Grumman, will be years behind schedule and 81% over budget, the U.S. military said last year.\n\nThe biggest defense firms, including Lockheed, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the executive order.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth unveiled sweeping changes in November to how the Pentagon purchases weapons, ⁠allowing the military to more rapidly acquire technology amid growing global threats, ​in accordance with an executive order signed by Trump in April.\n\nThat restructuring will ​have direct authority over major weapons programs to eliminate bureaucracy.",

    "description": "Professor Gene Sharp of Southeastern Massachusetts University has given several years of study to the possibilities of deterrence and resistance by",
    "fullText": "Professor Gene Sharp of Southeastern Massachusetts University has given several years of study to the possibilities of deterrence and resistance by civilians as a conceivable alternative, or partial alternative, to the traditional, purely military concepts of national defense that have so long prevailed and continue to prevail in European countries. He has restricted the range of applicability of his researches and reflections to Europe, and has directed them, within those limits, primarily to the neutral countries such as Austria and Finland. But his study is intended to apply, at least hypothetically, to such other countries, now members of one or the other of the great nuclear alliances, as might in some distant future succeed in detaching themselves from the alliance in question and thus find themselves compelled to devise an independent defense policy that makes sense with regard to the military and political realities of the present day. The question addressed in this book is essentially this: Where is the peace-loving, nonaggressive, and nonaligned country to find the maximum security against outside interference and domination in a world where war itself, and therefore the traditional preparations for war, have lost so much of their rationale as instruments of national policy?\n\nThe answer in the NATO establishment (and perhaps also, although with diminished conviction and enthusiasm, in the Soviet one, too) would be: in the nuclear deterrent, of course. Either, one would say, you have your own nuclear arsenal, or you ally yourself with someone else who has one.\n\nMr. Sharp challenges (quite correctly in the opinion of this reviewer) the validity of this supposed alternative. Not only is the nuclear deterrent by its very nature dangerously unstable but it is not really a means of defense. In the concept of nuclear deterrence, Mr. Sharp notes, “the capacity to defend in order to deter has been replaced by the capability to destroy massively without the ability to defend.” Beyond this there is, for any country wishing to go the nuclear road, the necessity of choosing between the development of a nuclear arsenal of one’s own, at vast expense and in defiance of the international effort to restrict proliferation, and the acceptance of an alliance with some existing nuclear power—a relationship bound, as experience has shown, to raise the unanswerable question about whose interests, those of the protector or those of the nominally protected, are eventually to prevail in a moment of crisis so brief as to be responsive only to the impulses of the computer.\n\nFinally, as Mr. Sharp also points out, to create a nuclear arsenal or to accept someone else’s missiles on one’s own territory is to increase immensely, from a point of near zero to a very high level, the danger that in any sort of a nuclear conflict one’s own country will become a likely target. Mr. Sharp could even have strengthened his case, in this respect, by pointing out that the Soviet leaders have repeatedly and specifically affirmed that they would never use nuclear weapons against any country that did not itself deploy them or permit them to be deployed on its own territory—an assurance that deserves greater credence than it has generally received, not only because there would be no reason to put out such a statement exclusively to deceive, but also because, given the general irrationality of the nuclear weapon, that policy in question makes perfectly good sense.\n\nThus for a nonnuclear country determined to pursue an independent policy but required to live under the shadow of the nuclear competition of the two super-powers, the nuclear option is not a hopeful one. But neither, for that matter, is an exclusive reliance on the traditional concepts of defense with “conventional” weapons. In an age of long-range striking power by aircraft, by missiles, even by long-range artillery, the idea of defense at the frontier has lost its reality. Beyond that, such is now the destructive power of even nonnuclear weapons that a war fought with them, particularly a defensive war presumably conducted largely on one’s own territory, promises nothing but a degree of devastation that makes a mockery of the very idea of military victory. Here we simply get back to the fact that war, generally, as among the industrially advanced and technologically sophisticated countries, can no longer serve any useful purpose—not even that of a defense.\n\nIt did not, actually, take the post–World War II advances in weapons technology to establish this fact. It is inescapably clear that in the two great European wars of this century there were, in reality, no victors. These were, in effect, simply senseless orgies of destruction. The damages they inflicted, on the nominal victor and the defeated alike, were far greater and more insidious than people were even aware of at the time, reaching as they did into the spiritual and genetic as well as the purely military and physical realms. It is idle for the independent European country of this day to suppose that by entering into a new and even more horrible round of such carnage it could protect anything worth protecting.\n\nThese two supposed alternatives for an independent defense on the part of the unaligned Continental country are therefore, when looked at carefully, no alternatives at all. It is not surprising, in these circumstances, that people’s minds should turn to the question whether there might not be some means of defense that would at least hold out hope of avoiding the sheer physical disasters that both of these supposed alternatives invite. It is this necessity that has led to Professor Sharp’s inquiry into the possibilities and limitations of civilian-based defense; and it would be unfair to judge it in any way other than in relation to the unpromising nature of these two, and only, visible alternatives. It is worth bearing in mind, as one reads his book, that however one assesses the possibilities of civilian-based defense, the nature of the available alternatives is such that it would not take much to be preferable to them.\n\nMr. Sharp’s study addresses itself, as its subtitle (The Potential of Civilian-based Deterrence and Defence) implies, both to deterrence and to resistance if deterrence fails. The two are of course closely connected; but each requires separate treatment, and receives it.\n\nDeterrence, in this instance, is of particular importance. For the study starts, as so much conventional military thinking fails to do, from the assumption that the presumptive attacker is motivated not just by a blind urge to destroy for destruction’s sake but rather by a wholly rational desire to gain domination over the political life of the victim country and to use that domination to his own advantage. And here, of course, is where the reactions of the civilian population—its will to resist and the preparation it has been given for doing so—come in. To deny this is to fly in the face of the historical evidence. For if we consider the failure of other powers to attack Switzerland during the two world wars, the failure of the Soviet Union to occupy Finland in the wake of their conflicts during World War II, and the similar abstention by Moscow from attacking Yugoslavia after that country’s break with the Soviet Union in 1948, we can see that calculations relating to the respective country’s presumptive powers of internal resistance, while certainly not the only considerations that played a part, occupied a prominent place among those that determined the final decision.\n\nThe successful imposition of foreign domination over a given country requires the ability of the dominating power to find, from among the population of that country, a faction either so inspired ideologically or so successfully cowed as to serve as a puppet government. It then requires that this faction should have the capacity to recruit the requisite indigenous bureaucracy, and to compel the population to accept and respect its authority. But whether these conditions can or cannot be met is something that will be importantly affected by the extent and effectiveness of the training, indoctrination, and general preparation for resistance that the population has received in advance of the event. This, in turn, is something the potential aggressor is likely to have a fair idea of before he takes the decision whether or not to attack; and his decision is bound to be affected by his assessment of its importance.\n\nAs for resistance itself if deterrence fails, there are a great many possible forms of this (Mr. Sharp has himself identified nearly two hundred of them). Some of these may be overt and largely spontaneous; others require the most highly centralized leadership, training, and direction. Some are designed to have military effect; others are directed solely to civilian administration. Some require mass participation; others can be conducted only conspiratorially, by carefully selected and highly trained individuals. The mix to be chosen in any given instance must depend on the nature of the country in question and the peculiarities of the prevailing situation. To select among these, and to conduct careful advance planning and preparation for their implementation, is a function that lies at the heart of civilian-based defense as Mr. Sharp sees it; and it is precisely in this respect that his reflections are most importantly innovative.\n\nFor seldom, if ever, in the contests of the past, has there been any such thing as this careful advance preparation. The resistance movements that made themselves felt during the Second World War were almost without exception ones that had to be improvised under conditions of extreme danger and difficulty—under the eyes and guns, that is, of the occupier. There can be no doubt that had they had the sort of advance preparation this study envisages, their effectiveness would have been increased several times over. Lines of command would have been known; effective channels of communication would have existed; there would have been adequate caches of weapons and supplies; ordinary citizens would have had guidance and instruction as to how to behave; given types of action would have been rehearsed and prepared.\n\nSkeptics may point to the long endurance of the Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe as evidence of the hopelessness of civilian resistance to domination by a strong outside power. But again, what they will be citing as an example is not at all what Mr. Sharp has in mind. There was, in those instances, no possibility whatsoever for advance preparation—quite the contrary. What the Soviet authorities found before them, as their armies overran this great region, was a territory where all semblance of real indigenous authority had already been swept away by the preceding Nazi-German occupation. It is often forgotten that it was not the Russians but the Nazis who destroyed the prewar status quo in that part of the world, and with it all social and political stability. What the Russians found there was in fact a territory ideally prepared to receive just the sort of domination they were desirous of establishing—a situation, in short, just the opposite of the one Mr. Sharp has in mind when he examines the possibilities of a resistance well prepared in advance by an indigenous government enjoying the confidence of the people. For this concept, there are, in fact, few examples. It is a modern concept, addressed to the unprecedented conditions of this modern age.\n\nI am not in total agreement with all of Mr. Sharp’s argument. There are places where the emphasis, in my view, could have been usefully shifted. I would have placed more weight on highly centralized, clandestine direction, less on spontaneous mass action. I am not sure that the nature of civilian defense planning should be so widely publicized as the author of the book would seem to envisage. I am less sanguine than he is about the possibilities for demoralizing the armed forces of an intruder. But these are minor differences, particularly if we take into account the limitations Mr. Sharp has placed on his own conclusions.\n\nThere is, of course, in this endangered world, no such thing as absolute defense for anyone; and Mr. Sharp advances no claim that a civilian-based system would provide this. He does not even claim that civilian-based defense could usefully constitute the only component of an adequate defense policy. He recognizes that it might have to be combined, at one stage or another, with the actions of certain types of regular military forces. He does not even depict his own conclusions as definitive. His plea is only that civilian-based defense has a legitimate place among the options open to the sort of country he is talking about; that this place is plainly larger than has been generally supposed; and that its possibilities ought to be more carefully studied and considered than they have been in the past. His primary purpose in writing the book was, he says, “to make civilian-based deterrence and defense a thinkable policy which is recognized as meriting further research, policy studies, and an evaluation.” And for this, he makes a reasonably good case.\n\nBut he must not expect, just for this reason, that the effort to win understanding for his views will be easy going. It goes against the grain of all established strategic thinking. The professional military establishments will brush it off with incredulity, if not with contempt. It will arouse in many circles the same skepticism, and perhaps the same derision, that this reviewer brought down upon himself when he had the temerity to advance somewhat similar ideas in a widely publicized radio lecture delivered over the facilities of the BBC many years ago.\n\nBut the view advanced in this book deserves consideration, if only because of the bankruptcy of all the visible alternatives to it. It might just be that in a world where the devices of long-range military destruction have proliferated beyond all reason, the greatest security any country can hope to have, imperfect as it is, will be found to lie primarily in its confidence in itself, in its readiness to leave other people alone and to go its own way, it its willingness to accept the sort of social discipline that a civilian-based defense implies—in a stance, in other words, that offers minimal incentive to foreign military intrusion but promises to make things difficult, painful, and unprofitable for any power that decides, nevertheless, to intrude. Such principles may not be everywhere applicable. Nowhere may they be the complete answer to the problems at hand. But beggars, in this world of destructive power unlimited, cannot always be choosers. And Mr. Sharp’s approach, certainly more humane and in a small way more hopeful than many others, deserves at least to be given a hearing.\n\nTo see things in this way will require, however, a rather basic change in the view hundreds of millions of people have been taught to take of the sources of national security and of the means by which it may be usefully promoted. The new view would be one that looks primarily inward—to the quality of the respective society, to the character of its institutions, to its social discipline and civic morale, rather than outward to the effectiveness of its armed forces—for the true sources of its strength and its security. It suggests, in Mr. Sharp’s words, “the direct defense of society as such—its principles, free institutions, and liberties—rather than a futile attempt to defend territory as an indirect means to defend the society.” It raises, in fact, the question whether any society can be stronger in relation to others than it is to itself.\n\nWhat is implied here is no less than a change in political philosophy. For it taps, as Mr. Sharp says in his final passages, “a crucial insight into the nature of power”—namely, that\n\nall political power is rooted in and continually dependent upon the co-operation and obedience of the subjects and institutions of the society…. It is indeed possible for whole societies to apply that insight…against internal and foreign aggressors, and to triumph…. With effort, risks, and costs, it is possible for Europeans—and all peoples—to make themselves politically indigestible to would-be tyrants. The process has already begun.\n\nPerhaps those words overstate the case; but if so, not greatly. One ends the reading of the book wondering whether, if this change in political philosophy were to take place, it might not have wider effects than just those that relate to the concepts of national security—whether many other things might not also change, and, in the main, usefully so.\n\nGeorge F. Kennan (1904–2005) was an American diplomat, political scientist and historian. He is best known for his role in shaping US foreign policy during the Cold War and, in particular, for the doctrine of containment. Kennan was Professor Emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton and served as Ambassador to the USSR in 1952 and as Ambassador to Yugoslavia from 1961 to 1963.

    "description": "Archer, Beta, and Joby are developing autonomous, gas-electric hybrid air taxis in hopes of clinching defense contracts.",
    "fullText": "US tech companies are hoping soon to gain clearance for flying taxis that make short commercial hops like Manhattan to LaGuardia Airport. Eyeing defense dollars, they're also equipping air taxies for the battlefield.\n\nAir taxis have wings and propellers, allowing them to take off and land like a helicopter and fly like an airplane. You can't yet hail a flying taxi anywhere in the US, though those futuristic flights could be coming in the next couple of years.\n\nPentagon leaders have shifted their focus to the tech industry, arguing that traditional defense contractors can't deliver new weapons fast or cheaply enough to meet today's fast-changing global threats. The Pentagon has pledged to pour billions of dollars into new technology and has issued requests for information on hybrid, autonomous air taxis, also known as vertical takeoff and landing vehicles, or VTOLs.\n\nFlying-taxi makers including Archer Aviation, Joby Aviation, and Beta Technologies say that gas-electric hybrid vehicles reminiscent of \"The Jetsons\" could carry military cargo more cheaply and quietly than helicopters. Some of the designs under development for the battlefield incorporate autonomous technology that could detect and avoid threats. The aircraft could be used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, or moving supplies and equipment, these companies say.\n\nAmerican air-taxi makers are racing to develop cutting-edge technology as Chinese companies like EHang do the same. The VTOL industry is still young, and China hasn't yet cornered the air-taxi market as it has for smaller, aerial combat drones.\n\n\"When we can fundamentally go further and faster than a helicopter, then we have a tool that's more powerful than what the Chinese are going to bring to the fight,\" said Beta's CEO, Kyle Clark.\n\nCommercial air-taxi designs are typically electric. Swapping the electric battery for a hybrid engine will help the aircraft carry more weight and travel farther, a key consideration for the Pentagon, executives from Joby and Beta told Business Insider.\n\nArcher, Joby, and Beta are all developing military VTOLs that can fly autonomously. In Beta's battlefield version, a human must plug in destination coordinates for the aircraft, and artificial intelligence can help it navigate to the destination, said Clark. Configuring the aircraft to operate without a pilot makes it lighter than a commercial air taxi, since it doesn't require seats or the safety and avionics systems that are necessary when transporting people, Clark added.\n\nClinching coveted contracts from the Pentagon would add air-taxi manufacturers to a growing list of dual-use companies that sell to commercial clients as well as to the government. Joby is collaborating with traditional defense firm L3Harris on a military VTOL and test-flew a prototype in November. Archer is developing one with Anduril Industries for the US, according to Archer's CEO, Adam Goldstein. Anduril is also developing a military VTOL called Omen in a joint venture with Emirati defense giant Edge Group.\n\nOne of the air-taxi makers' biggest hurdles to commercial adoption is securing Federal Aviation Administration certification, though the Trump administration is attempting to make it easier. In September, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced an FAA program that permits VTOL companies to test-fly piloted and unmanned aircraft before receiving federal certification.\n\nJoby is leading the pack in the certification race, having cleared four of the five stages for commercial clearance. Archer and Joby hope to fly commercially as early as 2026.\n\nFor defense adoption in the US, the companies would need the Defense Department to deem their VTOLs ready to fly, Goldstein said.\n\nTaylor Rains contributed to this story.",

    "fullText": "With RB Leipzig and Borussia Dortmund dropping points earlier on matchday 14, Bayern Munich knew a win would extend their lead to 11 points. Vincent Kompany surprised Mainz with a makeshift defense as Hiroki Itō, Kim Min-Jae, and Tom Bischof earned starting nods.\n\nApart from the suspended Luis Diaz, Bayern had their strongest lineup in the attack, though. Lennart Karl added himself to that list with his breakthrough season, and he had the game’s first shot with his usual technique.\n\nAt the other end, Lee Jae-sung was denied by the woodwork, although he knew very little about his header. That served as a wakeup call for Bayern with Daniel Batz forced to make three saves in less than five minutes.\n\nThe 34-year-old goalkeeper thwarted Harry Kane, Serge Gnabry, and Michael Olise, but it’s almost impossible to keep the Rekordmeister at bay these days. Karl opened the gates with a tap-in after an excellent play by Gnabry.\n\nThomas Müller, who could be considered as the last world-class attacker to come out of Bayern’s academy before Karl, celebrated the goal from the stands. Bayern did very little for the rest of the half, and they were punished for it before the half-time whistle.\n\nIn only his second Bundesliga appearance, Kacper Potulski beat Manuel Neuer with a strong header from William Bøving’s free-kick. Mainz’s equalizer needed a lengthy VAR check for an offside before Dr. Robin Braun allowed it to stand.\n\nBayern’s first chance of the second-half came at the hour-mark when Karl and Gnabry combined again. The latter failed to score from a close range after Karl’s excellent crossing. Kompany responded with triple changes, including handing Alphonso Davies his first minutes of the Bundesliga campaign.\n\nThe hosts seemed to raise the tempo as Batz denied Gnabry before Potulski’s goalline clearance from Kane’s follow-up effort. However, Mainz took the lead right away with a magnificent header from Lee Jae-sung.\n\nThe South Korean scored a brace when Mainz beat Bayern on matchday 14 last season, and he was at it again to guide home Stefan Bell’s inviting delivery. Kompany took the risk of playing without a recognized center-back by taking off Kim Min-jae and Hiroki Ito.\n\nComing off the bench, Nicolas Jackson tried to score from a difficult angle when Karl was waiting for another simple finish. Bayern did get a lifeline when Potulski fouled Kane inside the box, though. The Englishman kept his perfect record from penalty-kicks by scoring his 80th Bundesliga goal.\n\nHowever, Urs Fischer’s side managed to salvage a point in the first Bundesliga game for the Swiss as Mainz’s coach. Bayern Munich will travel to Heidenheim for their last game of the year, while Mainz play two more games in the space of three days against Samsunspor and St. Pauli.",

    "fullText": "Adm. Alvin Holsey, the commander of US Southern Command who reportedly clashed with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over the legality of US military strikes in the Caribbean, officially retired on Friday in a ceremony in Florida where he handed the reins of the command to his deputy.\n\nHolsey thanked his wife, his sons — one of whom is a currently deployed Naval aviator — and others who attended the event.\n\n“I’m reminded that in life, we don’t remember days, we remember moments. Those we lead don’t follow titles, they follow courage, and they remember the moments and how you made them feel,” Holsey said. “They remember those who listen and treated them with dignity and respect.”\n\nHolsey will be replaced by Air Force Lt. Gen. Evan Pettus, who has been serving as his deputy at Southern Command since Holsey was elevated to the role last year.\n\nSouthern Command is responsible for managing US military operations in most of Latin America and the Caribbean Sea.\n\nHolsey’s retirement was announced in October by Hegseth, less than a year into Holsey’s command and just days after the US conducted its fifth attack on an alleged drug trafficking boat off the coast of Venezuela. Hegseth and Holsey had disagreements over US operations in the region, two sources familiar with the matter previously told CNN.\n\nHegseth felt Holsey was not moving aggressively enough to combat drug traffickers in the Southern Command area of operations, CNN has reported, while Southern Command officials were concerned about the legality of the strikes.\n\nThose issues came to a head in an October 6 meeting at the Pentagon between Holsey, Hegseth, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine. One of the sources familiar with the situation said Holsey offered to leave his post during that meeting, CNN has reported, but the offer was tabled.\n\nThe legality of the US strikes against alleged drug boats has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks as lawmakers have demanded answers about a follow-on strike carried out in September that killed two survivors of an initial attack.\n\nCaine, who presided over Friday’s ceremony, called Holsey a “quiet professional” and “an extraordinary human who’s always led with your heart, your head, and gone all-in every single day of your service.”\n\n“You’ve made an incredible difference to our joint force. You made an incredible difference here in this headquarters. You make an incredible difference to this nation…we will always be grateful for the gift of a great example for you and your family’s service and sacrifice, and for the way that you’ve approached the professional wisdom of leadership and service,” Cain said. “The impact that you’ve had will last for a long, long time.”\n\nHolsey’s successor, Pettus, is an Air Force Academy graduate and a pilot of the F-15e and A-10 with more than 2,700 flight hours, according to his official biography. Prior to joining Southern Command, Pettus led the 12th Air Force (Air Forces Southern) stationed out of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona. Air Forces Southern provides “air, space and cyberspace capabilities throughout Latin America and the Caribbean,” Pettus’ bio says.\n\nPettus has been at Southern Command working as Holsey’s deputy during the alleged drug boat strike campaign that started in September at a time that the US has also been massing personnel and assets in the region and conducting training missions off the coast of Venezuela, even reopening a military base in Puerto Rico that had been closed for decades.\n\nCNN has reported that a significant percentage of all deployed US Naval assets are now in the theater, including the Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group, the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group, and the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit. Those groups amount to roughly 15,000 US troops, multiple guided-missile destroyers, an attack submarine, a special operations ship, and various fighter aircraft.\n\nThe relinquishment of Holsey’s command also comes just days after the US seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela; President Donald Trump said only that the vessel was seized for “very good reason,” in comments to reporters Wednesday. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a social media post announcing the seizure that the tanker had been sanctioned by the US for years “due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.",

    "description": "Deno 2.6 introduces deno audit with a new --socket flag that plugs directly into Socket to bring supply chain security checks into the Deno CLI.",
    "fullText": "Deno 2.6 was released this week with new security improvements that make it easier to catch threats before they hit production. The release introduces a new deno audit command that scans your dependencies against GitHub's CVE database, along with granular controls for lifecycle scripts and minimum dependency age requirements.\n\nDeno 2.6 also includes experimental Socket integration through deno audit --socket, which queries Socket's Firewall API to fetch malicious package detections and supply chain risk indicators in real time. While CVE databases catalog vulnerabilities after they've been discovered and reported, Socket's Firewall analyzes package behavior to catch threats as they emerge, things like typosquatting, malicious install scripts, and obfuscated code that slip past traditional scanners.\n\nSocket's supply chain security risk detection is available through two authentication modes:\n\nUnauthenticated mode provides instant security scanning for any Deno project:\n\nAuthenticated mode applies your organization's security policies when SOCKET_API_KEY is set as an environment variable. Teams can enforce company-wide rules and access detailed threat analysis across their entire dependency graph.\n\nTraditional vulnerability scanning relies on CVE databases, which only catch known exploits after they've been reported and cataloged. Socket's approach analyzes package behavior to detect supply chain attacks before they have a chance to hit your codebase.\n\nWith the Socket integration, Deno users get access to our threat detection for free, with continuous tracking of every package and version on npm (and other popular open source registries). Socket has identified and flagged thousands of malicious packages that will never receive CVEs, including attacks like Shai-Hulud, cryptomining campaigns, and the frequent typosquatting attempts targeting popular packages.\n\nDeno 2.6 integrates tsgo for faster typechecking. The team has observed a 2x speed improvement on type checking times for internal projects. The release also includes several security and dependency management features that complement Socket integration:\n\nGranular script control with deno approve-scripts replaces the previous --allow-scripts flag. When installing packages with lifecycle scripts, Deno prompts you to review and approve each package individually. Your choices persist in deno.json, creating an audit trail of which packages can execute code during installation.\n\nDependency age requirements let you specify minimum package ages in deno.json. Setting \"minimumDependencyAge\": \"7 days\" ensures your project only uses dependencies that have been publicly available long enough for the community to identify potential issues.\n\nThe dx command provides an npx-equivalent for running package binaries. While it defaults to full permissions like npx, it prompts before downloading packages and running lifecycle scripts, giving you visibility into what code executes during installation.\n\nCheck out the Deno 2.6 announcement post",

    "fullText": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — The United States is using its economic power to “assert its will\" and threaten military force against friend and foe alike, a Danish intelligence agency said in a new report.\n\nThe Danish Defense Intelligence Service, in its latest annual assessment, said Washington's greater assertiveness under the Trump administration also comes as China and Russia seek to diminish Western, especially American, influence.\n\nPerhaps most sensitive to Denmark — a NATO and European Union member country, and a U.S. ally — is growing competition between those great powers in the Arctic. U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed a desire to see Greenland, a semiautonomous and mineral-rich territory of Denmark, become part of the United States, a move opposed by Russia and much of Europe.\n\n“The strategic importance of the Arctic is rising as the conflict between Russia and the West intensifies, and the growing security and strategic focus on the Arctic by the United States will further accelerate these developments,” said the report, published Wednesday.\n\nThe assessment also follows the release last week of a new Trump administration national security strategy that depicts European allies as weak and aims to reassert America’s dominance in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said Russia is worried about NATO’s activities in the Arctic and will respond by strengthening its military capability in the polar region.\n\nThe findings and analyses in the report echo a string of recent concerns, notably in Western Europe, about an increasingly go-it-alone approach by the United States, which under Trump's second term has favored bilateral deals and partnerships at the expense of multilateral alliances like NATO.\n\n“For many countries outside the West, it has become a viable option to forge strategic agreements with China rather than the United States,” read the report, which was written in Danish. “China and Russia, together with other like-minded states, are seeking to reduce Western – and particularly US – global influence.”\n\n“At the same time, uncertainty has grown over how the United States will prioritize its resources in the future,” it added. “This gives regional powers greater room for maneuver, enabling them to choose between the United States and China or to strike a balance between the two.”\n\nThe Trump administration has raised concerns about respect for international law with its series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean — part of a stepped-up pressure campaign against President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela.\n\nTrump has also refused to rule out military force in Greenland, where the United States already has a military base.\n\n“The United States is leveraging economic power, including threats of high tariffs, to assert its will, and the possibility of employing military force – even against allies – is no longer ruled out,” the report said.",

    "fullText": "At 15-6, the Houston Rockets have moved just past the quarter pole of the 82-game regular season. That total of six losses is tied for the second-fewest in the 2025-26 Western Conference.\n\nYet, the Rockets aren’t entirely satisfied. They rank second in the NBA in overall net rating (+10.8) and defensive rating, trailing only the defending champion Oklahoma City Thunder. They are fourth in offensive rating.\n\nOf those six losses, five were games that could have been won in the fourth quarter. Crunch-time execution, particularly in half-court situations, has been an occasional issue. So, with a team led by a pair of 2025 All-Stars in Kevin Durant and Alperen Sengun, the Rockets believe they’re capable of more.\n\nComing off Saturday’s short-handed loss at Dallas on night two of a split back-to-back, the Rockets are currently in a rare scheduling break, with their next game not coming until Thursday (home versus the Los Angeles Clippers).\n\nSo, in the aftermath of a stretch with five games in seven nights, head coach Ime Udoka allowed his weary team to take Sunday and Monday off, entirely.\n\nBut Tuesday, the Rockets were back at it inside their Houston practice facility, and team activities included both a film session and a competitive practice.\n\nSpeaking post-practice, Udoka offered this assessment to local reporters (via Space City Home Network, SCHN):\n\nIt’s always good to dive into what we’ve done, and look at some trends. And then, we attack those on the court.\n\nWe want to be great, but I think we’ve been good, overall. If you look at the record, 15-6, there are some positives there. But we also feel like we let some (games) slip away, so we’re trying to find the areas where we’ve grown or had some slippage in. Overall, it’s good, but we’re trying to be better than good.\n\nWhat we looked at, today, was where we were at after the first 10 games, and what was happening in the last 11. You see some good and bad trends, overall. But for the most part, when your plus-minus is where we’re at, and offense and defense is where we’re at, we’re taking some good strides. We understand there’s another level we can get to.\n\nAs far as identifying potential issues beyond crunch-time execution. the Rockets are also 0-2 on night two of back-to-backs and 15-4 in all other settings. Fortunately, they have only one back-to-back (at Denver and Sacramento on Dec. 20 and 21) remaining this month, and they hope to have additional roster reinforcements — namely, Tari Eason and Dorian Finney-Smith — before the volume of back-to-backs increases in January.\n\nThursday’s tipoff versus the Clippers (6-18) is at 7:00 p.m. Central from Toyota Center, and the game will be televised regionally on SCHN and nationally via NBA League Pass.\n\nMore: Tari Eason, Dorian Finney-Smith hope to rejoin Rockets in coming weeks\n\nIme Udoka meets with the media after the #Rockets returned to practice today\nThe team last played on Saturday the final game of 5 games in 7 days\nNext up the Clippers at home Thursday.@HoustonRockets I #AllFire pic.twitter.com/0odUbry02R\n\n— Space City Home Network (@SpaceCityHN) December 9, 2025\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rockets Wire: Ime Udoka: 15-6 Rockets are good, but striving for ‘better than good’",
