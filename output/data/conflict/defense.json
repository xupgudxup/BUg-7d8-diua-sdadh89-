    "fullText": "Republican senators led by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) are coming to senior White House aide Stephen Miller’s defense after some of their GOP colleagues called for a White House shake-up.\n\nGOP senators rattled over their party’s prospects in the midterms and unhappy with Miller’s public comments on Greenland and immigration enforcement view the deputy White House chief of staff as a growing political liability for both President Trump and the GOP.\n\nBut he commands strong loyalty from a number of Republican senators on Capitol Hill.\n\nGraham, who also came to Miller’s defense last month, told The Hill on Sunday that Miller “is going to be proven right that we should be more aggressive” on immigration policy. And he argued that Miller’s and Trump’s tough talk about Greenland has put the United States in position to substantially strengthen its Arctic defenses.\n\n“People can disagree with Stephen on rhetoric and they can disagree with him on policy but the question is, ‘Is Stephen Miller in jeopardy in Trump World?’ Absolutely not,” Graham said.\n\n“To my Republican colleagues who wring their hands all the time about what somebody says in Trump World: We have an opportunity here to go on the offense. Sanctuary cities are about as popular as a toothache,” he argued. “I would hope that Republicans focus on — the problem’s not with Stephen Miller, Kristi Noem, me or Trump. It’s with four years of Biden policy.\n\n“It doesn’t matter what a senator thinks about a president’s adviser, as long as the president has confidence in that adviser. I have confidence in Stephen Miller that he’s going to help us go on offense,” Graham added. “We’re going to have a vote next week on the Senate floor on sanctuary cities and Stephen Miller helped orchestrate that with me.”\n\nMore than a dozen Republican senators submitted on-the-record comments to The Hill on Sunday praising Miller and pushing back against public and anonymous criticisms from Senate GOP colleagues who want to diminish Miller’s clout at the White House.\n\nSen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.), who represents a critical swing state, for example, said Miller “has been instrumental in delivering on the promises President Trump and I made during the campaign.”\n\n“Because of him and other members of the President’s team, critical priorities like stopping deadly fentanyl, unleashing America’s energy, and bringing much-needed economic relief for working families are now a reality for Pennsylvania,” he said.\n\nEleven other Republican senators offered praise of Miller as key member of Trump’s team.\n\n“I’ve worked with Stephen Miller for more than a decade to secure our borders, lock away criminals, and keep America safe. I highly value his counsel, as I know President Trump does as well,” said Senate Republican Conference Chair Tom Cotton (Ark.).\n\nMiller’s influence over Trump’s immigration enforcement policy has come under increasing scrutiny within the Senate GOP conference as senators face a shutdown of the Homeland Security Department on Friday.\n\nDemocrats are threatening to block even a short-term continuation of Homeland Security funding unless Trump agrees to a list of reforms to “rein in ICE” and “stop the violence.”\n\nMiller’s role in Trump’s muscular approach to foreign policy, particularly threats to use military force against Greenland, also is under a magnifying glass as about 20 senators — Democrats and Republicans — are scheduled to travel to the Munich Security Conference later this week to meet with NATO allies.\n\nThose congressional delegation trips may get canceled because of the looming Homeland Security shutdown, which Democrats are threatening to trigger in protest of the administration’s deportation raids.\n\nA group of Republican senators are becoming fed up with Miller’s clout at the White House and want Trump to bring in advisers with different perspectives into his inner circle.\n\n“I think the truth be told he would not win a majority of a popularity contest in our conference,” said Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), summarizing the view of Miller among Republican senators.\n\n“Number one, he has a condescending demeanor to begin with. He doesn’t take advice. He sort of dictates. He provides doctrine. And you know these are U.S. senators with an election certificate. He should show them some respect,” Tillis added of Miller.\n\nSeveral other GOP senators who spoke on condition of anonymity said they believe Miller has too much power over Trump’s agenda and that his advice on foreign policy and immigration issues is leading the administration toward unpopular positions.\n\nA Republican senator who requested anonymity acknowledged that Tillis, who is not seeking reelection, has been the most outspoken in criticizing Miller. But this GOP senator said Tillis’s views are shared broadly within the Senate GOP conference.\n\nThe lawmaker said many Republican senators view Miller as the driving force behind aggressive apprehensions that are becoming national stories, such as the detention of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos, an asylum-seeker from Ecuador, who was picked up in Minnesota with his father and sent to a holding facility outside San Antonio.\n\n“There are senators from deep-red states describing incidents about kids who are dropped off at school and then the parents are detained after the kids are dropped off, and the [school] principal has to be able to find someone to take the kids,” the source said. “Members say we want to be there for law enforcement, but this is not right.”\n\nA New York Times/Siena College poll of 1,625 registered voters conducted Jan. 12-17 found that 61 percent of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) tactics have gone too far and just 36 percent approved of how ICE was handling its job.\n\nA PBS News/NPR/Marist poll of 1,462 adults conducted Jan. 27-30 found that 65 percent of Americans think ICE tactics have gone too far.\n\nA second Republican senator who requested anonymity said colleagues from battleground states want Trump to balance Miller’s influence on immigration policy and other core elements of his agenda with advisers who have different views.\n\n“I think there need to be other people advising the president because certainly for a number of our members that are going to be in tough elections … [they want] different points of view advising the president so that he has a menu of options and selections in front of him,” the senator said. “Some are going to work better in certain states than others. It’s not a broad stroke of the brush here.”\n\nThe senator added that Trump’s policy menu “has been limited” for much of his second term so far, especially on immigration enforcement policy.\n\nBut there’s also a large group of Trump allies in the Senate Republican conference who support Miller’s no-holds-barred approach to immigration policy and are willing to give the administration broad latitude to pressure European allies over Greenland.\n\n“Stephen has effectively pushed for policies that are making America safer, like in Memphis in my home state of Tennessee, more prosperous, and more respected around the world,” said Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.).\n\nGraham, who has perhaps the closest relationship with Trump of anyone in the Senate GOP conference, told The Hill that Miller is in many ways the architect of the Make America Great Again movement.\n\nHe predicts that Senate Republicans will unify this week behind Miller’s aggressive approach to sanctuary cities, despite the public backlash sparked by the fatal shootings of two protesters in Minneapolis last month by federal immigration officers.\n\n“Any GOP colleague or observer of Washington that believes that Donald Trump doesn’t have full faith in Stephen Miller should not be allowed to be driving in Washington. He is Karl Rove to MAGA,” Graham said in an interview, referring to President George W. Bush’s top political adviser.\n\nRove was so influential during the earlier administration that he was called “Bush’s Brain.”\n\nGOP Sens. Mike Lee (Utah), Steve Daines (Mont.), Roger Marshall (Kan.), Ted Cruz (Texas), Bernie Moreno (Ohio), James E. Risch (Idaho), Eric Schmitt (Mo.), Cynthia Lummis (Wyo.), Rick Scott (Fla.), and Ron Johnson (Wis.) also submitted statements Sunday praising Miller.\n\nGOP Sens. Jim Banks (Ind.), Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.) and Tommy Tuberville (Ala.) have also praised Miller on social media.\n\n“@StephenM is a long time friend and trusted advisor. Grateful for his leadership and everything he does to help President Trump every day,” Banks posted on the social platform X on Jan. 27.\n\nMiller, who served as a senior adviser to Trump during his first term, has seen his power and authority grow dramatically since then. Correspondingly, Trump has taken a much more aggressive approach toward immigration enforcement and foreign policy within the Western Hemisphere during his second term.\n\nAnd the senior advisers who cautioned the president during his first term to restrain himself on domestic and international affairs — former White House chiefs of staff Reince Priebus and John Kelly, former Attorney General Bill Barr, former Secretaries of Defense Jim Mattis and Mark Esper, and former Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley — are long gone.\n\nEsper and Miller, for example, clashed over what Esper called Miller’s “absurd” plan to send 250,000 active-duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nMiller clashed with other senior advisers including Barr and Milley over how to respond to the Black Lives Matter protests that were raging in cities around the country, according to a book by Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Bender.\n\nWhen Miller remarked the protests reminded him of a war zone, Milley turned around in his seat, pointed his finger at Miller and said, “Shut the f‑‑‑ up, Stephen,” according to the book.\n\nBut Trump appeared to side at the time with Miller and seemed more inclined to bring force to bear on the protests, despite caution and restraint urged by other senior aides.\n\nMilley has since fallen out of favor with Trump and had his security detail and clearance stripped by the Pentagon in January.\n\nDuring Trump’s second term, Miller has expanded his influence over the president’s foreign policy agenda, proclaiming in CNN interview earlier this year that the United States has a right to take over Greenland.\n\n“You can talk all you want about international niceties and everything else, but we live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power,” he told CNN host Jake Tapper.\n\nA third Republican senator who requested anonymity said Miller should stay away from foreign policy, arguing that his swaggering talk about Greenland threatens important NATO alliances.\n\n“The thing is the president is very fond of Stephen Miller and that’s the main thing,” the lawmaker said. “I think there are some things I would rather the administration stay away from,” the lawmaker added, referring to the White House’s aggressive push for Greenland.\n\nThe senator added that talk of seizing Danish territory by military force if necessary and the images of masked ICE and Border Patrol personnel using excessive force on protesters in Minneapolis have fueled Democratic criticism that Trump is leading the country toward authoritarianism.\n\nBut Graham, a prominent defense hawk on Capitol Hill, said that most GOP senators don’t understand what the Trump administration is trying to accomplish by maneuvering for U.S. control of Greenland.\n\n“People have no idea what they’re talking about on Greenland. I’ve been on the ground floor of that. Stephen Miller and a lot of us were helping the president. The critics of Trump seem to have zero depth about what’s really going on,” he said.\n\n“We wound up getting Greenland in a good spot. We have more control over Greenland than ever and we’re going to build up our Arctic defenses,” Graham added. “It’s fashionable now, it seems to be, in Republican circles to worry about what Trump said or somebody said in Trump world.\n\n“My advice would be, let’s keep governing well,” he said. “Let’s start prosecuting the case about how out-of-sync the Democrats are with the American people.”",

Adi Gonen, as well as the Nahal Brigade, killed 11 and arrested six at the time.\n\nGonen told the Post and other media at the time that the goal is, \"the central purpose is to locate the enemy and to destroy him or accept his surrender…Yesterday, 17 terrorists were killed or surrendered,\" to a mix of Golani and Nahal forces.\n\nOn Monday, the IDF said that Hamas had violated the ceasefire and that Israel views the violation as severe, but would continue to enforce the deal.",

However, wide receiver Kayshon Boutte believes New England missed out on numerous opportunities throughout the game.\n\n“I said they played well, I wouldn’t discredit that,” Boutte said on Sunday after a reporter asked what made Seattle’s defense so good. “But I think as an offense we left opportunities out there too, as I said, they did everything we expected them to do, we just didn’t execute.”\n\nSeattle’s defense did an excellent job of keeping New England in check for most of the game, holding it scoreless until the fourth quarter.\n\nBoutte had a challenging night, finishing with just one catch on five targets for a total of 21 yards. A significant factor in Boutte’s struggles was quarterback Drake Maye, who also had a difficult game, turning the ball over three times — two interceptions and a fumble.\n\nNew England’s offensive line also played a significant role in the offense’s inability to move the ball, leading to Maye being sacked six times.\n\nThe Patriots struggled to find their rhythm until late in the game, but by then, they were too far behind on the scoreboard to mount a comeback.\n\nPatriots, Celtics Meet Same Fate On Super Bowl Sunday",

    "description": "Hassan Ismail cofounded a defense tech startup in Canada. He found the country's regulations difficult to navigate, and the investors too risk-averse.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Hassan Ismail, the 24-year-old cofounder of Yellowcake, who lives in Toronto. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn 2021, there was a government bid in Canada for some military hardware. My cofounder and I officially founded West Tek Defense Corporation in August 2022. We were doing smart rifles for the military.\n\nIt was complicated. (At one point, we were literally balancing redox equations for propellant in the ammo.) The physics background we both had helped a lot; essentially, everything we saw was something we'd encountered in a class or during personal research.\n\nWe spent about three years on the entire process. Ultimately, we found out it wasn't going to work — mostly because of regulation.\n\nWe spoke to the head of the civilian side of procurement for the bid, and we were flat-out told something like: \"There's no reason for us to consider you. We don't even care.\" For us to even find the contact for who was running the bid, it was a bunch of dead links. We had to go pester extremely high officials to get us the appropriate contact.\n\nTo be able to produce firearms in America, you need an FFL. You go through a pretty standard process: apply, background check, reason.\n\nIn Canada, the equivalent of an FFL is a BFL. We weren't able to get a BFL until we had a contract. We had to convince some type of agency, as two kids, to buy an idea. Almost all of them at first would be receptive: \"Sure, can we see this thing?\" We'd have to awkwardly explain to them: \"Well, you have to order them before I can even produce them, because of government regulation.\"\n\nJustifiably, most of them were like, \"Nope.\"\n\nWe took this terrible 3D-printed demo to the law enforcement in Northwest Ontario. It was falling apart. I could tell they pitied us.\n\nIt was regulatory law after regulatory law. After a while, we did finally get our BFL.\n\nIt turns out, if you want to subcontract this — which you will if you're a startup, because the startup doesn't have millions to start some manufacturing project — whoever you subcontract to needs their own BFL.\n\nIt really seemed that it was tailored against any kind of startup or disruptor to come in and break the status quo.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin was that a lot of manufacturing businesses are going under here. Every time we'd reach out to a company, they'd either say they don't have the budget to help us, or they would and then would call us back later and say something to the effect of, \"We're going bankrupt.\"\n\nInvestors would say: Until you guys lock in these contracts, this $1 billion government bid, we're not going to touch it. These guys were looking for fourth- or fifth-time founders who already had multi-hundred-million-dollar exits.\n\nOne of our angels, who was the first money in, is on the board of a Big Tech company. He wrote us a $50,000 angel check. We'd pitch investors on that — and Canadian investors wouldn't care.\n\nAmerican investors were interested, but the issue was that they were interested in American defense, not really Canadian defense. They also had a lot of compliance issues with investing in foreign defense.\n\nWe ended up shuttering that. We still have the patents. The tech is still ready to go.\n\nWe got into the University of Waterloo's accelerator and started a new SaaS startup.\n\nThis startup is a Delaware C Corp. American investors — who rightfully want to invest in American companies, because it's what they're familiar with — are far more friendly and open-minded.\n\nMany Canadian investors have very hostile agreement conditions. One investor wanted to do CA$100,00 at a $3-5 million valuation. For reference, we ended up raising our round at $1.6 million at a $10 million post-money capitalization in America. They were offering less than a fraction. It's brutal.\n\nEveryone in our cap table is American, or Canadian expats living in America. None of our investors are actually living in Canada.\n\nWe'd like to move the business to New York. We think it is going to be the next tech hub. Clay CEO Kareem Amin is a McGill grad. He's Canadian. He also lets us co-work in his office in Chelsea.\n\nYC initially deciding not to invest in Canadian corporations is totally justifiable. There are a lot of Canadian founders in YC. What that's telling them is: Canadians aren't even confidant in building Canadian companies. They're all moving to America anyway.\n\nI understand their decision to reverse it. The backlash was coming from a place of political climate and ignorance. A lot of people were seeing it as YC sticking the middle finger to Canada.\n\nEveryone that we know, as well as Canadian YC founders that we know and love, have all said the same thing: This is a stupid debacle.\n\nWe all understand why YC did it.",

    "description": "Sen. Lindsey Graham ended meeting with Lebanese defense chief after official refused to call Hezbollah a terrorist organization, sparking tensions.",
    "fullText": "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., swiftly pulled the plug on a meeting with Lebanese Chief of Defense Gen. Rodolphe Haykal after the Lebanese official refused to confirm that the Iranian regime-backed Hezbollah movement is a terrorist organization.\n\nGraham posted to X a blunt message about his frustration with the state of Lebanon in particular and Mideast power politics in general.\n\n\"I just had a very brief meeting with the Lebanese Chief of Defense General Rodolphe Haykal. I asked him point blank if he believes Hezbollah is a terrorist organization. He said, ‘No, not in the context of Lebanon.\" With that, I ended the meeting. They are clearly a terrorist organization. Hezbollah has American blood on its hands. Just ask the U.S. Marines,\"\n\nHe continued, \"They have been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by both Republican and Democrat administrations since 1997 – for good reason. As long as this attitude exists from the Lebanese Armed Forces, I don’t think we have a reliable partner in them. I am tired of the double speak in the Middle East. Too much is at stake.\"\n\nLawmakers Question Whether Us Moving Fast Enough To Capitalize On Hezbollah's Weakened State\n\nHaykal’s refusal to recognize that Hezbollah is a terrorist organization set off security alarm bells among leading experts on the movement.\n\nMatthew Levitt, a leading scholar on Hezbollah from the Washington Institute, told Fox News Digital that, ‘Gen. Haykal’s comment is only going to further concerns that the LAF sees Hezbollah as an actor with which it should deconflict, rather than disarm. The ceasefire agreement is clear that Hezbollah must be disarmed, in both the south and north of the country. In several instances to date, the LAF appears to have shared with Hezbollah targeting intelligence obtained from Israel through the US-led mechanism rather than acting on it.\"\n\nHe added, \"At a time when the LAF is seeking international aid, purportedly to disarm Hezbollah, failing to recognize the group as an adversary not only of Israel but of Lebanon as well undermines the case for further funding.\"\n\nFox News Digital sent multiple press queries to Lebanon’s embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\nIsrael Warns Hezbollah ‘Playing With Fire,’ Presses Lebanon To Act On Weapons Pledge\n\nSarit Zehavi, a leading Israeli security expert on Hezbollah from the Israel Alma Research and Education Center, told Fox News Digital that, \"I was not surprised by what Haykal said. This is exactly the problem. Hezbollah is not designated as a terrorist organization in Lebanon. The Lebanese army... is not willing to clash with Hezbollah. Hezbollah is not willing to voluntarily disarm. It will not happen as long as there is no clash.\"\n\nZehavi claimed the Lebanese Armed Forces has \"helped Hezbollah to conceal is military activity and weapons storages in south Lebanon.\"\n\nThe U.S. brokered a ceasefire in Nov. 2024 between Hezbollah and Israel. In August, Lebanon’s government accepted an American plan to disarm the group by the end of 2025. That deadline does not seem to have been met.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Turkey, Thomas Barrack, who also serves as envoy to Syria, said at a recent Milken Institute event that Lebanon is a \"failed state.\"\n\nCartel Connection: Hezbollah And Iran Exploit Maduro’s Venezuela For Cocaine Cash\n\nBarrack said, \"The confessional system does not work. A Maronite president, a Sunni prime minister and a Shia speaker; 128 parliamentary seats split equally between Islam and Christians; everything is a deadlock.\"\n\nHe said, \"Hezbollah is a foreign terrorist by U.S. standards,\" and \"it also happens to be a large political party within Lebanon that has blocking rights… This idea of saying you have to disarm Hezbollah … you’re not actually gonna do it militarily.\"\n\nBarrack said, \"The U.S. is saying Hezbollah needs to be disarmed, Hezbollah is a foreign terrorist organization, it cannot exist. My personal opinion is you kill one terrorist, you create 10. That can’t be the answer.\" He urged the Lebanese political leadership to \"run to Israel and make a deal...there is no other answer.\"\n\nWalid Phares, an American academic expert on Hezbollah and Lebanon who has advised U.S. presidential candidates, told Fox News Digital that \"The disarming of Hezbollah is not just a U.S. and international request but also and most importantly a request by a majority of Lebanese since at least the Cedars Revolution in 2005, when 1.5 million Lebanese Christians, Druze and Sunnis rallied against the Syrian occupation and the Khomeinist militia.\"\n\nHe added, \"While the Assad forces withdrew, Hezbollah remained armed. In May 2008, the radical Shia militia conducted an urban military coup against the pro-Western government and seized full power until the Israel-Iran war, known as the 12-day war of 2025. The latter was provoked by Hezbollah siding with Hamas during the Oct. 7 war.\"\n\nFox News Digital reported in November that the Trump administration ramped up pressure on the Lebanese government to disarm Hezbollah.\n\nOriginal article",

Keep independent journalism alive. Support HuffPost.\n\n“No, I didn’t see that,” Trump replied in video from Forbes Breaking News. “Is that true, is that right?

He was booed at a firefighters’ union conference in Boston in 2024, during Trump’s presidential campaign. He was booed by protesters in Vermont when he traveled there with his family last March for a ski vacation. He was booed by the audience at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., the same month.

    "description": "The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Thursday that Russia’s Starlink satellite internet terminals in Ukraine have been “cut off,” disrupting Russian military communications.",
    "fullText": "The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Thursday that Russia’s Starlink satellite internet terminals in Ukraine have been “cut off,” disrupting Russian military communications.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said SpaceX, which owns Starlink, is working with Ukraine to update a “whitelist” of approved and verified Starlink terminals, while unapproved Russian systems have been blocked.\n\n“The Starlink terminals added to the ‘whitelist’ are working. The Russians’ terminals have already been blocked,” Fedorov said in a statement Thursday. “We continue to verify Starlink terminals. The first batch of terminals that made it onto the ‘whitelist’ are already operational.”\n\nA source at the General Staff of the Ukrainian armed forces claimed that “all Russian Starlinks have been cut off” along the front line as of Thursday evening local time.\n\nUnder US sanctions, Starlink cannot be sold to or used by Russia. However, analysts and Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia has increasingly been finding ways to leverage the system to its own advantage. CNN previously reported on Russia’s practice of mounting Starlink systems on its attack drones, which allow the weapons to bypass Ukraine’s electronic defenses that disable drones by jamming GPS and radio signals, and to strike deeper into the country.\n\nUkraine has also relied heavily on Starlink since the beginning the war, using it to operate military communications and drones, as well as information systems for public institutions like hospitals and schools.\n\n“The enemy on the front lines is facing not just a problem, but a catastrophe. All command and control of the troops has collapsed. Assault operations have been halted in many areas,” said Serhii Beskrestnov, an adviser to the defense minister.\n\nElon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, said earlier this week that it was taking steps to stop Russia’s “unauthorized” use of the Starlink satellite internet constellation. Musk reiterated Thursday that it’s “important to register your Starlink terminal if in Ukraine.”\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Defense has not addressed the claims of Starlink disruptions.\n\nBut Russian military bloggers began commenting on the Starlink outages on Wednesday and Thursday, noting that Russia’s internet and communications capabilities on the front line have taken a hit.\n\nOne pro-Kremlin military blogger, Boris Rozhin, wrote a Q&A-style post on Telegram, saying, “Yes, it will have a certain impact on internet availability in the field,” and “yes, there are no alternatives at all, right now.” He also claimed that Russian forces were working to bypass the block and to bring high-speed internet to the field using other methods.\n\nAnother Russian military blog, which supports the airborne special forces, tried to downplay the disruption, writing: “The Starlinks may have been shut down, but the backup communications are still there. The radios are working, and there’s communication between the positions.”\n\nSome Starlink units used by the Ukrainian side were also reportedly cut off, although it’s unclear how widespread the disruption is, as the government continues the whitelisting process.\n\nOne Ukrainian combat officer, Tetiana Chornovol, posted on social media that “the shutdown of Starlink left my two combat positions without communication,” adding that her unit has since brought in an alternative communication system.\n\n“It works for us,” a Ukrainian drone pilot said in a video posted to Telegram. “We immediately registered our Starlink terminal, and everything is fine.”\n\nMeanwhile, the second round of trilateral talks between Ukraine, Russia and the United States concluded in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.\n\nUkrainian presidential chief of staff Kyrylo Budanov, who was part of his country’s delegation, described the negotiations as “truly constructive.”\n\n“I am grateful to the US and the UAE for their high-quality organization and mediation,” Budanov told the Ukrainian news agency RBC-Ukraine.\n\nWhile no breakthrough deal came out of the two days of talks, Russia and Ukraine did agree to conduct their first prisoner exchange since October. Each returned 157 prisoners of war to the other side on Thursday, according to Russian state news agency TASS and US negotiator Steve Witkoff.\n\n“While significant work remains, steps like this demonstrate that sustained diplomatic engagement is delivering tangible results and advancing efforts to end the war in Ukraine,” Witkoff said Thursday in a post on X.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the negotiators agreed to hold another round of talks “in the near future.”\n\nCNN’s Ivana Kottasová, Daria Tarasova-Markina and Sophie Tanno contributed to this report.",

    "title": "BYU’s defense is to blame for 3 consecutive losses. What’s gone wrong?",
    "description": "Since the start of Big 12 play, the Cougars have been among the league’s worst defensive squads.",
    "fullText": "BYU’s offense did its job Wednesday night.\n\nYes, the Cougars turned the ball over too much, but they also shot 50% from the field, 43% from 3-point range and scored 92 points, which is all typically more than enough offensive firepower to capture road wins in the Big 12.\n\nBut instead of picking up a much-needed, stabilizing Quad 1 victory at Oklahoma State, BYU found itself on the wrong end of a memorable 99-92 upset, as the Cougars’ defense completely whiffed against the Cowboys.\n\nBYU offered little resistance against the Cowboys, who drove downhill all night to score 52 points in the paint — something a frustrated Kevin Young repeatedly mentioned to reporters following the loss, and an increase of more than 20 points from BYU’s previous season average of paint points allowed.\n\nIn the second half alone, Oklahoma State scored 58 points at a blistering average of 1.57 points per possession. Every time the Cowboys had the ball after halftime, they ended up 1.57 points richer, with BYU only stopping them 24.3% of the time.\n\nAccording to the defensive analytics provided by StatBroadcast, neither AJ Dybantsa nor Richie Saunders, two typically solid defenders, recorded a single defensive stop against Oklahoma State. Every time the Cowboys targeted Dybantsa or Saunders, they scored.\n\nBYU’s remaining starters weren’t much better on the defensive end. When Rob Wright III, Kennard Davis Jr. and Keba Keita were on the floor, Oklahoma State averaged 153.4, 148.8 and 146.8 points per 100 possessions each, respectively.\n\n“Our defense, it was terrible,” Young said after the loss. “They had 52 points in the paint. They scored at will. We couldn’t keep anyone in front of us, and it was just a layup fest.”\n\nYoung later added, “We couldn’t guard the ball. We got too spread out. That’s way too many, you know, 52 points in the paint, it’s not good, right? And then attention to detail, that’s something that our team has struggled with ... but more than anything, just our one-on-one defense was abysmal.”\n\nWednesday’s letdown was the loudest example of BYU’s most troubling recent trend — a widespread defensive plunge.\n\nAs noted by broadcaster Greg Wrubell on X, the Cougars ranked No. 17 nationally in KenPom’s defensive efficiency metric back on Jan. 5. Just a month later, BYU has plummeted 25 spots to No. 42.\n\nBYU's KenPom offensive and defensive efficiency ratings on--\n\nJan. 5:\n10th AdjO\n17th AdjD\n\nFeb. 5:\n10th AdjO\n42nd AdjD\n\n— Greg Wrubell (@gregwrubell) February 5, 2026\n\nBeing the country’s 42nd-best defensive team may appear fine on paper, especially considering BYU ranked No. 82 at the end of last season. But the Cougars’ defensive results since the start of Big 12 play, which spurred the 25-spot slide, are cause for major concern.\n\nBYU is allowing Big 12 opponents to score 83.4 points per game, ranking 13th out of 16 teams in the conference. The only teams behind the Cougars are Kansas State, Arizona State, and Utah, who are all far outside of the NCAA Tournament conversation.\n\nFor comparison, top-10-ranked Houston, Iowa State and Arizona are all allowing Big 12 averages of 63.3, 67.7 and 71.9 points each, respectively — quite the gap from BYU’s 83.4 mark.\n\nIn their current three-game losing skid, the Cougars have surrendered 275 points (91.67 per game), with Arizona, Kansas and Oklahoma State combining to make 61.9% of their 2-point baskets.\n\nDuring BYU's 3 game losing streak, they have allowed opponents to shoot 61.9% from 2 point range.\n\nFor the entire season, the worst defense in 2pt% allowed in the nation is 62.5% by Chicago St.\n\n61.9% would be the 2nd worst in the nation.\n\n— CougarStats (@CougarStats) February 5, 2026\n\nBYU has to figure out a way to get stops, disrupt opposing rhythm and guard without fouling so often. The Cougars can’t rely on their offense to bail them out of shootouts every night — look at how that’s gone the past three games.\n\nDuring nonconference play, BYU enjoyed various flashes of defensive brilliance, albeit against lesser competition than the current Big 12 gauntlet.\n\nThe Cougars don’t need newfound brilliance, but if they can’t quickly figure out some sort of improvement to yield defensive respectability, their postseason ceiling becomes dramatically lower. Defense will determine how far BYU plays into March.\n\n“... We’re just going through it right now,” Young said. “We’ve just got to lick our wounds and just work, work, work and figure out what each guy individually can do to help the team right now.”",

    "description": "Online users claimed Hegseth, the secretary of defense, ordered the removal of Powell's name from a list of notable Americans.",
    "fullText": "In February 2026, online users shared a rumor claiming U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth removed former Secretary of State Colin Powell's name from a list of noteworthy military figures hosted on the Arlington National Cemetery website.\n\nThis rumor, originating in March 2025, referenced the removal of links to pages about Black, Hispanic and female veterans buried at the site, among other Department of Defense removals occurring in the early weeks of President Donald Trump's second term.\n\nThe Office of Army Cemeteries, a division of the U.S. Army, operates the prominent military cemetery just outside Washington. The Army and other military branches report to the DOD.\n\nFor example, one Threads user reposted (archived) a meme on Feb. 1, 2026, reading, \"Pete Hegseth removed Colin Powell's name from a list of notable Americans, buried at Arlington. Hegseth also removed the names of every person of color and every woman on the same list. Only white men were left in place.\" Social media users shared the rumor about Hegseth, who is white, and Powell, who was Black and died in 2021.\n\nIn short, as of March 2025 — and continuing through February 2026 — the cemetery website's page titled \"prominent military figures\" still featured a brief biography describing Powell's military service, in which he achieved the rank of a four-star Army general.\n\nWhile neither Hegseth nor anyone under the umbrella of the Defense Department entirely deleted Powell's name from the page, sometime between late February and early March 2025, one or more people with access to edit the page removed a partial amount of biographical information pertaining to Powell's race, as well as one mention of his name from the biography of another noteworthy service member. Someone later restored those pieces of information in mid-to-late March.\n\nThe remainder of the rumor claiming \"Hegseth removed the names of every person of color and every woman,\" and that \"only white men were left in place,\" was not entirely true. In a March 2025 post from Hegseth's personal X account, he called the entire rumor \"fake,\" responding to a popular X post (archived) promoting the text later featured in the above-pictured meme.\n\nIn a March 2025 email to Snopes, Kerry L. Meeker, the chief of public affairs at Arlington National Cemetery, labeled the claim that someone removed Powell's name from the website \"inaccurate.\" \"All notable graves are represented on our website – including Colin Powell,\" she said.\n\nShe pointed us to a statement (archived) on the cemetery's website that mentioned \"no service members have been permanently removed from the 'notable graves' section of our website.\" The statement also referenced \"compliance with executive orders issued by the president and Department of Defense instructions.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued an executive order (archived) on Jan. 20, 2025, the first day of his second term, seeking to end \"illegal\" programs and activities related to diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as DEIA, with the \"A\" standing for accessibility. The order targeted DEIA-related \"mandates, policies, programs, preferences and activities in the federal government, under whatever name they appear.\"\n\nAn archived version of the Arlington National Cemetery website's \"prominent military figures\" page from late February 2025 displayed Powell's biography beginning with the sentence, \"General Colin Powell, a Vietnam veteran, was the first African American to hold three of the U.S. government's highest positions: national security adviser (1987-1989), chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (1989-1993), and secretary of state (2001-2005).\"\n\nBetween February and March, one or more people also removed, then later restored, a mention of Powell's name in the biography for Brig. Gen. Roscoe Conklin \"Rock\" Cartwright. The late-February version featured a sentence entirely removed from the page, reading, \"Cartwright founded a social group that provided mentoring and leadership training to African American officers; prominent members included Generals Colin Powell (Section 60) and Roscoe Robinson Jr. (Section 7A).\"\n\nColin Powell receives the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom from President George H.W. Bush at the White House on July 3, 1991. (Howard L. Sachs/CNP/Getty Images)\n\nOther temporary removals from the \"prominent military figures\" page included 17 mentions of \"African American\" and around a dozen for \"black.\" Many of the mentions of \"African American\" and \"black\" described milestones, such as Brig. Gen. Hazel W. Johnson-Brown, originally documented on the page as \"the first African American woman general in the U.S. Army.\"\n\nThe biography for Maj. Kurt Chew-Een Lee originally began by describing him as \"the first Asian American officer in the Marine Corps.\" As of March 21, that fact, as well as the words \"Asian American,\" no longer appeared on the page. The most recent version of his biography also removed the following sentence featured in previous years: \"Kurt Chew-Een Lee's record of service not only honored his country, but also demolished anti-Asian stereotypes: 'I wanted to dispel the notion about the Chinese being meek, bland and obsequious,' he told the Los Angeles Times in 2010.\" Those facts about Lee, as well as the quote, reappeared on the website at some point between March 24 and March 29, according to versions of the page archived through the Wayback Machine.\n\nIn an apparent oversight in the removal process of race-related content, as of March 17, the page still displayed Lt. Col. Alexander T. Augusta of the U.S. Army as \"the highest-ranking African American officer of the Civil War,\" as well as \"the Army's first black physician, the United States' first black hospital administrator (Freedman's Hospital, Washington, D.C.) and its first black professor of medicine (Howard University).\"\n\nSometime between March 17 and 21, some mentions of \"Black\" and \"African American\" reappeared on the website, according to archived page captures.\n\nAfter we asked Meeker about the removals from Lee's biography about demolishing anti-Asian stereotypes and the fact Augusta's biography still featured four mentions of his race — and before the removals to Lee's biography were restored — Arlington National Cemetery spokeswoman Becky Wardwell provided a link to a video from Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell. In the March 20 video, Parnell said, in part, \"We want to be very clear, history is not DEI.\" He also discussed making mistakes and mentioned the usage of artificial intelligence to perform some content edits to comply with the Trump administration's orders.\n\nParnell's mention of errors possibly at least partially referenced the removal, and later restoration, of entries for three women on the \"prominent military figures\" page. Those women were Lt. Cmdr. Barbara Allen Rainey, \"the first woman pilot in the Navy,\" Maj. Marie Therese Rossi, \"the first American female combat commander to fly into battle\" during the Persian Gulf War, and Lt. Kara Spears Hultgreen, \"the first female carrier-based fighter pilot in the U.S. Navy, and the first woman to qualify as an F-14 combat pilot.\"\n\nAll three women disappeared entirely from the cemetery website's page in late February or early March, and reappeared sometime between March 17 and 21, according to archived page captures.\n\nBurns, Robert, et al. \"Colin Powell Dies, Trailblazing General Stained by Iraq.\" The Associated Press, 19 Oct. 2021, https://apnews.com/article/colin-powell-dead-covid-9c918dc1c137ebf368f2cbb461e4fad4.\n\nChristensen, Laerke. \"Arlington National Cemetery Removed Links to Webpages about Black, Hispanic and Female Veterans.\" Snopes, 14 Mar. 2025, https://www.snopes.com//fact-check/arlington-national-cemetery-veterans/.\n\n\"Colin Powell | Biography & Facts.\" Britannica, https://www.britannica.com/biography/Colin-Powell.\n\n\"Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs And Preferencing.\" The White House, 20 Jan. 2025, https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/.\n\n\"Learn More about Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility (DEIA).\" New York Department of State, https://dos.ny.gov/dei.\n\n\"Organization.\" The United States Army, https://www.army.mil/organization/.\n\n\"Our Cemeteries.\" Office of Army Secretaries, https://armycemeteries.army.mil/About-Us/Our-Cemeteries.\n\n\"Wayback Machine.\" Archive.org, https://web.archive.org/.",

    "description": "The developers behind Ukraine's interceptor drones are working to ensure that these cheap air defense tools don't become obsolete.",
    "fullText": "The developers behind Ukraine's interceptor drones are constantly having to upgrade their products to keep pace with changing Russian tactics and ensure these cheap air defense tools don't become obsolete.\n\nSeveral people directly involved with interceptor drones and their development told Business Insider that the systems are being upgraded, though how quickly those improvements roll out varies.\n\nInterceptor drones emerged last year as a crucial, low-cost tool Ukraine uses to defend against worsening Russian attacks.\n\nThese weapons are typically used to hunt fixed-wing Russian drones conducting strike and reconnaissance missions. They're armed with small warheads and fly directly into their targets or explode nearby to destroy them midair.\n\nSome Ukrainian interceptor drones cost as little as $2,500 — just a fraction of the price of the Russian drones, estimated to cost between $10,000 and $100,000, depending on their battlefield function.\n\nRussia has changed its tactics over the past year, modifying its drones to fly faster and higher and even arming them with cameras and air-to-air missiles to defeat Ukrainian defenses. The changes have forced Ukraine's defense industry to adapt.\n\nWild Hornets, a defense technology outfit making drones for the Ukrainian military, \"continuously plans upgrades\" to its drones and other related equipment like ground control systems, said Alex Roslin, the firm's foreign support coordinator.\n\nThis process occurs daily, he said, and \"innovations\" are made at all levels of the production journey, from individual components to new systems like Wild Hornets' well-known Sting interceptor drone.\n\nRoslin said the firm is focused on refining its drones and scaling up production, priorities the team discusses every day.\n\nSome other products receive improvements at a slower pace. For instance, the British government, which is working to produce thousands of interceptor drones a month for Ukraine, said in early January that it updates the design about every six weeks \"to stay ahead of Russian tactics.\"\n\nBritain said \"live battlefield data feeds straight into UK production lines, allowing rapid upgrades and faster delivery to the front line.\"\n\nAs the need for interceptor drones grows among Kyiv's forces, so does the market for these weapons. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters last month that the local defense industry is producing around 1,000 systems a day, hitting the goal he set over the summer.\n\nWith so many interceptor drones now on the market, competition is driving manufacturers to constantly improve their products to fly faster and higher to meet the Russian threats, said Oleksiy, the deputy commander of a Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces mobile air defense unit.\n\nOleksiy's unit is tasked with protecting Irpin, a city on the outskirts of Kyiv, and has historically relied on a .50-caliber M2 Browning machine gun mounted in the bed of a pickup truck to battle Russian drones.\n\nHis crew began training on new interceptor drones last year to strengthen their defensive arsenal. The drones can fly at speeds of around 300 kilometers per hour (186 miles per hour) and reach an altitude of up to 6,000 meters (nearly 20,000 feet).\n\nHe said the quadcopter-style interceptor drone his crew trains with is updated every six months using feedback from combat forces provided to the manufacturer.\n\nThe rise of Ukraine's interceptor drones has come as Russia has invested heavily in long-range drone operations, regularly sending hundreds of drones — some armed and others decoys designed to exhaust air defenses — across the border in nightly attacks.\n\nWestern military officials and Ukrainian organizations have said that interceptor drones are responsible for downing thousands of Russian drones over the past year.\n\nNATO countries are taking note of the interceptors' success as a low-cost air defense tool, with some allies buying and deploying systems to defend the Eastern flank from possible Russian drone incursions.",

    "description": "Four women have taken the stand to accuse the wealthy Alexander brothers of rape. Here are their stories —and what defense lawyers say in response.",
    "fullText": "The Alexander brothers' sex-trafficking trial is in its second week, and each sibling has now watched from the defense table as a woman told the jury that he raped her.\n\nIn sometimes tearful testimony, these accusers described being drugged, overpowered, or filmed while barely conscious. None reported their alleged assaults to police. The trial is expected to last a month.\n\nTal Alexander, 39, was a real-estate broker who, along with his brother Oren Alexander, 38, sold multimillion-dollar properties in Miami and Manhattan to wealthy and influential clients. The third brother, Alon Alexander — Oren's twin — is a former executive at their parents' private security firm.\n\nAll three brothers are being held without bail and face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.\n\nHere are the women's accounts and the defense case presented so far.\n\nThe first rape accuser testified under the pseudonym Katie Moore about an incident in Manhattan in 2012, when she was a 20-year-old marketing intern. Moore described a night of partying with a small group that included her friend Ainsley, Tal Alexander, Alon Alexander, and the brothers' then-friend, actor Zac Efron.\n\nMoore told the jury she collapsed at a nightclub after one sip from a drink handed to her by one of Tal's friends.\n\nWhen she came to, she said, she was naked on a bed in the two brothers' shared Manhattan apartment. \"I don't want to have sex with you,\" she said she told Alon, who was standing at the side of the bed, also naked.\n\n\"But you already did,\" she testified he told her, laughing, before raping her again.\n\nJurors saw text exchanges in which Moore told her boyfriend of the alleged rape, and heard from two friends who said she told them, too. \"My advice was that it would be ineffective to go to the police,\" given that the Alexanders were \"powerful people,\" testified one friend, now a lawyer in Massachusetts.\n\nThe defense is arguing that photos from the evening show Moore drinking and having fun — including one taken by Efron that she uploaded to Facebook the next morning. The defense suggests that Moore had consensual sex with Alon and repeatedly lied to hide it from her boyfriend.\n\nThe second rape accuser testified under the pseudonym Maya Miller about an incident at a luxurious beachfront Hamptons rental in 2016, when she was a 24-year-old aspiring model about to enter nursing school.\n\nMiller testified that she spent the second evening at the house rebuffing Tal's advances and guarding herself and her friend Alicia, who had lost consciousness after half a glass of wine. (Miller said she herself had poured any drink that was handed to her down the sink when no one was looking).\n\n\"This is how you thank me for inviting you to a beautiful home?\" Miller said Tal angrily asked her the next morning, chasing her into the bedroom's shower, where she said he grabbed her by the neck and raped her. \"You wanted that,\" she said he told her afterward.\n\nJurors heard from two friends who described Miller tearfully telling them about the alleged attack. Jurors also saw an email from Tal to Alon reading, \"See below these cheap hookers coming to the Hamptons.\"\n\nThe defense questioned why Miller never spoke with Alicia about the incident, and pointed to photos of the two women enjoying high tea at the Plaza Hotel once they returned to Manhattan. They also showed the jury friendly text messages Miller shared with Tal before flying home.\n\nThe third accuser took the stand under the pseudonym Amelia Rosen.\n\nRosen said she was 17 and an aspiring model from Ukraine in 2009, when Oren, then 21, and a second, unnamed man videotaped themselves having sex with her in a Manhattan bedroom.\n\nRosen has no memory of that evening and told the jury she learned of the video when she was contacted by federal prosecutors, who say it shows her naked, stumbling and, at times, unable to move.\n\n\"I can hardly understand what I was saying,\" Rosen said tearfully, when shown a snippet of what prosecutor Andrew Jones has called a \"trophy tape,\" depicting the twin \"stone-cold sober\" as he sets up a tripod.\n\nBoth sides had warned the jury during opening statements that the video may be disturbing, and some jurors appeared visibly upset when they viewed it in court on Thursday.\n\n\"It will be unnerving to you,\" Oren's defense lawyer, Teny Geragos, told the panel's six men and six women. But \"what this video shows is not sex trafficking,\" Geragos added.\n\nThe fourth accuser, a Ukrainian native who testified under the pseudonym Bella Koval, described being drugged and raped in 2016 while guests of the brothers at the same Hamptons rental described by the second accuser.\n\nKoval, then a 23-year-old model, said she and the friend she brought, Alison, met the brothers on the exclusive dating app Raya.\n\nShe told jurors that a few sips from a \"fruity,\" ice-filled drink, handed to her by Oren, left her teetering on her high heels during a poolside party. A glass of water handed to her by Alon, who had helped her into a first-floor bedroom, then left her conscious but unable to move, she testified.\n\n\"He had no expression other than this brooding anger,\" during the rape that evening, Koval testified. \"I was unable to scream,\" she testified.\n\nKoval testified that her friend Alison told her she was \"gang raped\" that night. Koval also told jurors that in the following hours and days, she told an ex-boyfriend and two female friends she'd been drugged and raped.\n\nThe defense challenged Koval's testimony that she was not a heavy drinker and her decision to stay at the Hamptons house a second day. Koval blamed the home's isolation, the Labor Day \"surge pricing\" for car service, and her fear of the brothers' power and influence.",

    "description": "Volodymyr Zelensky has been talking up Russia’s battlefield fatalities and has asked his new Defense Minister to make it a priority.",
    "fullText": "Volodymyr Zelensky has been talking up Russia’s battlefield fatalities and has asked his new defense minister to make it a priority.\n\nIn December alone, more than 35,000 Russian soldiers were killed or seriously wounded, Ukraine’s leader says, and the aim should be to raise the number even higher – to 50,000 per month.\n\n“Make the cost of war for Russia one it cannot sustain, thereby forcing peace through strength” – this was the task set him by the president, Mykhailo Fedorov told reporters in his first briefing as Defense Minister.\n\nThe suggestion that Russia is suffering heavy losses is not new. A new report last week estimated that 1.2 million Russians have either been killed, wounded or are missing since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost four years ago – the highest casualty figure suffered by a major military power since World War II. The report put the number of Ukrainian casualties between 500,000 and 600,000.\n\n“The data suggests Russia is hardly winning,” the report’s authors wrote.\n\nMaybe not, but as senior officials from Ukraine, Russia and the United States prepare for the next round of direct talks in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, it would be a mistake for Ukraine’s supporters to get carried away.\n\n“Highlighting the huge numbers of Russian fatalities is an indicator that Ukraine’s main strategy is attrition. But we need more than that if we are going to move the war dynamics in a better direction,” a former Ukrainian official told CNN.\n\nOn the one hand, focusing on headline-grabbing numbers offers important perspective on Ukraine’s refusal to give up Donetsk as part of any “peace” deal with Russia.\n\nThe logic behind Kyiv’s position is simple: Very few Ukrainians believe Putin has any goal other than the total subjugation of their country. So, why hand over territory for nothing if Ukraine can expect to kill hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers while Moscow keeps trying to capture Donetsk by force?\n\nUkrainian soldiers still hold about 20% of the eastern region, which includes heavily fortified cities like Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, and latest estimates by the Institute for the Study of War suggest it could be another 18 months before Russia captures it all.\n\nIf those Russian soldiers are not killed fighting – the logic continues – they will remain in occupied Ukrainian territory ready to restart the war, from a more advantageous position, just as soon as the Kremlin has contrived a pretext to do so.\n\nVery few in Ukraine believe Putin will drop his territorial demands, and most have lost faith that US President Donald Trump will apply necessary pressure to make him change his mind.\n\n“Despite the government negotiating in good faith, many think the whole process is done to ensure US government support,” the former Ukrainian official said.\n\n“People are exceedingly skeptical about the negotiating process.”\n\nBut if there is no confidence that negotiations are headed anywhere, what about Ukraine’s battlefield strategy? Is piling up the other side’s body bags the best way forward?\n\nAn American former fighter, Ryan O’Leary, who led an international volunteer unit called Chosen Company, believes not, triggering a vigorous debate after he laid out his arguments in a social media post.\n\nHe took issue with the much vaunted “e-points” scheme, whereby Ukraine’s units earn points for each Russian soldier killed or piece of materiel destroyed. The points are exchanged for new equipment, and the Defense Ministry says the scheme provides a wealth of data that helps shape future plans.\n\nBut O’Leary suggested they create the wrong incentives, causing Ukrainian commanders to prioritize more straightforward drone strikes against infantry targets around the line of combat, rather than tougher but more significant deep strikes against Russian logistics - like vehicles and communication hubs, as well as Russian drone crews operating from rear positions.\n\n“Drone warfare is not about who hits more soldiers today … Operational depth is where wars are decided. If the enemy can move fuel, ammo, drones, crews, and repair vehicles 10 to 40 km behind the line without fear, they own depth even if they lose 5x the men in trenches,” O’Leary wrote on X.\n\nIn truth, his accusation lays bare Ukraine’s two key structural challenges.\n\nFirstly, in drone technology, operating tactics and countermeasures, Russia has caught up and is quite possibly ahead.\n\nWriting on Facebook, Oleksandr Karpyuk, an aerial reconnaissance officer in the 59th Separate Assault Brigade, complained that Ukraine had failed to capitalize on its early advantage in this space, particularly by not diversifying the number of radio frequencies used by its drones to transmit signals.\n\nConsequently, once Russia improved its electronic warfare (EW) technologies, it needed to jam just two frequencies to put a significant dent in Ukraine’s ability to fly drones behind Russian lines.\n\nIn addition, Karpyuk writes, Russia’s tactical air defense crews are much improved, and Moscow continues to benefit from taking a lead in developing fiber-optic drones, which are impervious to Ukraine’s own EW countermeasures, because they do not transmit signals.\n\nAnd then there is Ukraine’s manpower issue.\n\nThe infantry shortage is well known. Rob Lee of the Foreign Policy Research Institute estimates there are fewer than ten Ukrainian infantry soldiers per kilometer of front line. He also estimates that most brigades have at most 10% of their total personnel in the infantry. Traditionally, that number would be upwards of 30%.\n\nLee told KI Insights, a strategic intelligence unit powered by the Kyiv Independent, that even those low numbers have been enough to prevent a major breakthrough by Russian forces, which have succeeded only in making small, incremental advances.\n\nBut in a war where drones - not infantry - matter most, it is Ukraine’s shortfalls in drone crews that are most pressing, especially in the key battle for operational depth – the destruction of targets up to 25 miles (40 kilometers) behind the line of combat.\n\nIn a forthright defense of the fighters under his command, the head of Ukraine’s Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Forces, Robert Brovdi, said last week there needed to be a threefold increase in the number of drone operators. Just 30% of the frontline – which stretches 745 miles – is currently covered, he wrote on his Facebook page.\n\nFedorov, the new defense minister, acknowledges the scale of the problem, telling the Ukrainian parliament some 2 million people are ignoring their call-up papers, while 200,000 others have deserted.\n\nMuch now rests on his ability to address the manpower issue and to regain Ukraine’s technical edge, all the while ensuring he is hitting Zelensky’s targets.\n\n“Unless we constantly stay ahead of Russians in technology and battle tactics, I cannot say the chance we will prevail is high,” cautioned the former Ukrainian official.\n\nCNN’s Victoria Butenko and Daria Tarasova-Markina in Kyiv contributed to this report.",

    "description": "The Patriots’ defensive coordinator made his first public appearance since his cancer diagnosis at Super Bowl Opening Night.",
    "fullText": "Drake Maye commanded the biggest crowd during the New England Patriots’ appearance at Super Bowl Opening Night on Monday. Mike Vrabel and Stefon Diggs also drew plenty of attention at their respective spots on the risers, as did other big-name players.\n\nTerrell Williams, meanwhile, was not as prominently featured. He did not have a riser, nor any fixed cameras watching his every action over the 60-minute period. And yet, interest in him was still substantial.\n\nFor good reason, too: the 51-year-old made his first public appearance since leaving the team with a cancer diagnosis in late September. Having recently been found cancer-free, he joined the Patriots on their trip to Super Bowl LX against the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nWilliams will not resume his full duties as defensive coordinator yet. However, he will continue keeping a close eye on a unit that has delivered some uplifting moments for him amid personal challenge.\n\n“It’s been joyous for me just to watch them, and watch them develop and watch them buy into the message that [Mike Vrabel] is preaching,” Williams said. “Trust me, I’ve been in this game a long time and it’s not easy to get people these days to buy in. Vrabes has that unique ability to get them to do that. That’s the fun thing to watch. I know exactly what he’s telling them.”\n\nHead coach Mike Vrabel has been vital in guiding the Patriots in 2025, but assistant Zak Kuhr also filled a critical role with Williams sidelined. The inside linebackers coach took over as defensive play-caller and de facto coordinator.\n\nTheir ability to adapt on the fly has allowed the Patriots to not skip a beat defensively. For Williams, it all comes back to the staff chasing a common goal — and to Kuhr being up to the task as well.\n\n“We all believe in the same things. The message has been the same throughout, from the time we got there to the time we met today,” Williams said.\n\n“So, whether it’s Zak, or whether it’s Scott Booker, or whoever it is, we’re all preaching the same message. Sometimes, when you coach in this league, you’ve got coaches who are pulling in different directions. Everybody has a motive. The only motive for us was to improve. Not to win, but to improve. We figured that the improvement would come, but Zak has done an unbelievable job.”\n\nFor Kuhr, moving into an elevated role early in the regular season was not entirely unfamiliar. He had also filled in for Williams during the offseason, when the nominal DC spent three months away from the team due to an unrelated medical condition.\n\nNonetheless, the Patriots defense and its coaches kept chugging along. In the postseason, the group has played its best football to date.\n\nLeading the way is Zak Kuhr, and the Patriots offensive coordinator is happy to see it.\n\n“I’m proud of him,” said Williams. “I’m looking forward to him calling this game on Sunday.”",

    "fullText": "NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — There’s a chance the dreaded buzz of propellers heard on Ukrainian battlefields is coming from drones built in a country with a population of just over a million on Europe’s southeastern fringe: Cyprus.\n\nManufacturer Swarmly says there are more than 200 of its H-10 Poseidon drones helping Ukrainian artillery batteries pinpoint enemy targets on the ground in all kinds of weather, racking up more than 100,000 hours in the air over the last three years.\n\nIts 5,000-square-meter (54,000-square-foot) factory, where the whir of grinders shaping composite plastics reverberates off the walls, has become a major source of uncrewed vehicles shipped to countries such as Indonesia, Benin, Nigeria, India and Saudi Arabia, according to company officials. Most of the factory floor is reserved for uncrewed aerial vehicle manufacture. But tucked in a secure storage area is a selection of Swarmly's super-fast marine drones replete with high-definition cameras and .50-caliber machine guns.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has driven even the smallest European Union member countries to develop their home-grown, high-tech defense industries, just as necessity has made Kyiv a world leader in cutting-edge UAV technology. Many EU countries have partnered with Kyiv to develop that technology, and Ukraine’s front lines are usually their testing grounds.\n\nLike Cyprus, the Baltic countries and Denmark have revved up their domestic drone and counter-drone technology. In Greece, drones are part of a 25-billion euro ($29-billion) overhaul of its armed forces.\n\n“The example of Swarmy, as well as other important companies based in small EU countries, is a testament to the serious effort made by the private sector in Europe to innovate and build mass production capacity of defense items, including uncrewed systems,” said Federico Borsari, an expert with the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis.\n\nUAVs are reshaping warfare by offering less militarily capable countries some leverage over superior adversaries. Drones aren't going to completely replace big-ticket weaponry like tanks, artillery and warplanes, said Borsari. But they offer flexibility and bang for the buck, making them a formidable force multiplier.\n\nTake Swarmly's explosives-packed, satellite-guided Hydra marine drone. Each one costs 80,000 euros ($94,500), which means deploying a group of them to neutralize a billion-euro warship can be a bargain, said company director Gary Rafalovsky.\n\nThis sort of naval weapon taking out a much larger warship is already evidenced by Houthi attacks from Yemen, according to Fabian Hinz, a research fellow for missile technologies and UAVs at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Europe.\n\nBarriers to entry for undercapitalized companies are low, he added, because UAVs are often designed and assembled from components cheaply and readily available on the global market.\n\n“And that, of course, means that basically you don’t have to have a great industrial investment at first that you need with other military capabilities. You don’t need decades of experience in certain material sciences or these kinds of things,” Hinz said.\n\nIn Denmark, a pair of companies focusing on anti-drone devices have reported a surge in new clients, and some of the devices were to be shipped to Ukraine to assist in jamming Russian technology on the battlefield. Ukraine in September said it was partnering with Danish companies to build missile and drone components at a factory in Denmark.\n\nIn the Baltic country of Lithuania, scientists and business partners have joined forces under the name VILNIUS TECH to develop UAVs, automated mine detection and other military technologies. The state-run ammunition factory Giraite says it has increased production capacity by 50% since 2022.\n\nGreece for the first time showcased its homemade drones and counter-drone technology during a full tactical exercise in November as NATO urged Europe's defense sector to pick up the pace.\n\n“We need capabilities, equipment, real firepower and the most advanced technology,” NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte warned during a visit to Romania earlier that month. “Bring your ideas, test your ingenuity and use NATO as your test bed.”\n\nEven as drone development accelerates, Borsari cautioned that the advantages of UAVs are often tempered by numerous variables like the harsh conditions in which they sometimes fly, operators’ training and skill levels, as well as the depth of logistical support to keep them functional.\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine and the Trump administration’s mixed messages that have strained relations with NATO allies have forced European leaders to reckon with the need to become more self-reliant on defense. So the EU has made billions of euros available to encourage investment and bolster its collective deterrent capability.\n\nThat's been a boost to nations like Cyprus, which assumed the six-month EU presidency on Jan. 1. Last week, the EU’s executive arm approved financial assistance for eight members including Spain, Croatia, Portugal, Bulgaria, Belgium, Romania and Cyprus.\n\nCyprus is set to receive final approval from EU leaders for some 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in low-cost, long-term loans under the EU’s 150-billion-euro joint ($177-billion) procurement program called Security Action for Europe (SAFE).\n\nIts nascent defense industry is already made up of around 30 companies and research centers that produce technology for both civilian and military sectors, including robotics, communications networks, anti-drone systems and even satellite communications and surveillance, said Panayiotis Hadjipavlis, chief of the armaments and defense capabilities development directorate within Cyprus' Defense Ministry.\n\n“We have niche capabilities on very high-tech products and this has to be taken seriously into account,” Hadjipavlis told The Associated Press in his office, where the helmet from his fighter pilot days hung on a nearby coat rack.\n\nMajor defense industry players, he added, are among those who should take note.",

    "title": "Raheem Morris primer: What to expect from the 49ers defense and how each position is impacted",
    "description": "Breaking down what to expect from the 49ers defense under their new DC, and who will benefit the most",
    "fullText": "When the San Francisco 49ers interviewed only three candidates for the defensive coordinator job, it felt like the two minority candidates were nothing more than a formality before hiring Gus Bradley. We will see if Bradley heads elsewhere after the 49ers hired Raheem Morris to replace Robert Saleh as their defensive coordinator.\n\nThere was speculation that Jim Schwartz would be a candidate. Recent reports have made Eagles’ defensive coordinator Vic Fangio’s return uncertain. Ultimately, Shanahan gets to work with Morris for the fourth time in the NFL.\n\nMorris’s Rams’ defense aligns with the 49ers’ defensive philosophy heading into last offseason: stop the run. From 2021 through 2023, while Morris was the Rams’ defensive coordinator, they ranked seventh in rushing EPA and fifth in rushing success rate.\n\nAt his core, Morris runs an odd front. So you’re going to hear a lot about how Nick Bosa will have to stand up, maybe five plays a season. You can run 5-man fronts with your base defensive end having his hand in the ground—more on that shortly. It’s worth noting that Morris has shown flexibility. Back in 2020, his defense ran only an odd or bear front — a 3-4 look —17 percent of the time.\n\nHere is an example of a couple of odd fronts Morris and Jeff Ulbrich ran last year with Atlanta:\n\nThat is a classic “bear front,” where you have a pair of 3-techniques and a nose tackle head up over the center. From a personnel perspective, it is easy to see how the 49ers could get their three rookies from the 2025 draft on the field at the same time. CJ West would be the nose tackle, while Alfred Collins and Mykel Williams would be the 3-techniques. Then Nick Bosa and whichever edge rusher the down-and-distance calls for on the opposite side. Morris isn’t going to be the coach to tell Bosa he has to stand up in this scenario.\n\nWhen you do run these five-man fronts, and let’s say Bosa is lined up to the side where there are multiple tight ends or eligible receivers, like the screenshot below, that’s when Bosa would more than likely need to peel off into the flat or drop as a hook defender, which is what ended up happening with the Falcons:\n\nOne way to ensure Bosa rushes the passer is by walking down a linebacker to the edge. In today’s NFL, this is known as a “Penny” front, and it’s something Morris has been doing for years. In Atlanta, he used Kaden Elliss as their adjuster in base packages. Morris did the same with Ernest Jones when he was in Los Angeles. These players can moonlight as edge rushers.\n\nThe adjuster for the 49ers was Dee Winters in 2025, who lined up on the edge 78 times last season. Here’s an example of Winters walking down to the edge in Week 1 on the left side of the screen. Next to him is Mykel Williams, with Jordan Elliott at nose, Kalia Davis as the other defensive tackle, and Bosa on the opposite edge.\n\nThis front all but ensures Winters, Mykel, and Bosa all get 1-on-1 opportunities. Hiring Morris could end up being one of the most beneficial things to happen for the 49ers’ first-round pick from 2025. The majority of Williams’ rushes should come from the interior under Morris with a runway. You can’t ask for a better setup.\n\nI was wondering who would be the 3-technique and how much the 49ers would need to invest in a defensive tackle this offseason, but that player is already on the roster. It’s just a matter of how quickly Williams will develop in Year 2.\n\nWinters is under contract for one more season. We don’t know what to expect from Nick Martin because we didn’t see much of him as a rookie. However, Martin’s calling card coming out of college was that he was at his best rushing the passer. Walking Martin down in these fronts, given his history, likely made Morris an easy sell.\n\nThe 49ers’ signing Elliss as a linebacker would be the least surprising move, given his fit in this defense and how it would allow Warner to patrol the middle, if Morris isn’t a fan of Winters or Martin.\n\nHere’s another look at Winters walking down as the adjuster the following week in New Orleans when the 49ers were in their base defense:\n\nWinters is on the left side of the screen, lined up next to Mykel. The 49ers are in their “big nickel” personnel, with Ji’Ayir Brown in instead of Upton Stout. Not that he can’t do it, but these strong reductions protect Stout from being in the run fit down after down. Instead, as you can see, the nickel is protected, and now it’s a linebacker inserted into the action.\n\nBosa’s return to health should unlock Bryce Huff. Williams cemented himself as an interior pass rusher, and those two outside of him will lead to favorable matchups. If the defense can get anything out of Collins and West as pass rushers, the product on the field in 2025 will seem like a distant memory.\n\nPlayers like Sam Okuayinonu, a restricted free agent, and Keion White should have a greater impact with reduced roles as sub-package players. To reach its ceiling, the team will need the top two picks from the ’25 draft to contribute.\n\nHaving a dominant linebacker like Fred Warner gives Morris the versatility he hasn’t had. The beauty of these 5-1 penny fronts is that you really only need one linebacker. When that player is Warner, you can be uber-aggressive elsewhere.\n\nAfter six weeks of the 2025 season, the Falcons’ defense ranked No. 1 in total DVOA, including first against the run and the pass. They were No. 5 in EPA per play. They were blitzing at a rate that would make Kyle Shanahan triple-check the numbers. Atlanta’s blitz rate was 42.4 percent, second only to Brian Flores.\n\nIt was a sign that Morris was comfortable evolving his scheme. After all, we’re talking about a guy who comes from a Vic Fangio-adjacent tree, and they are not known for their blitzing. The Falcons weren’t getting after the quarterback, so they decided to turn up the heat and manufacture pressure by blitzing.\n\nThe Falcons loved to blitz their nickel. Only two cornerbacks in the league blitzed more than Stout did last year. Stout’s win percentage as a pass rusher was 20.5 percent. It’s a skill set that is just scratching the surface. No player won more at his position with at least 15 pass rushes last year than Stout. He bested second place by three percentage points. It’s another building block for Morris to use in passing situations.\n\nThe Falcons ran Cover 3 at the fifth-highest rate last season and Cover 6 at the third-highest rate. That’s where the 49ers will likely live this year, with quarters being sprinkled into the mix. Despite the heavy blitz usage, Atlanta ran man coverage (Cover 1) at the third-lowest rate last season.\n\nWhich brings us to the secondary…\n\nJessie Bates found out about Morris’s versatility at safety this past season after being named a second-team All-Pro. Bates, who had primarily been a free safety, had lined up closer to the line of scrimmage and in the box more than any other season in his career through the midway point of 2025.\n\nLast year, in every regular-season game, 49ers’ cornerbacks Deommodore Lenoir and Renardo Green lined up on the same side. Falcons cornerback A.J. Terrell often shadowed a receiver. If there was an obvious No. 1 on the other side, Terrell was following him. That will be a change from Saleh to Morris, especially if the 49ers feel like they have a cornerback who is quality enough to travel with the opposition’s best.\n\nSaleh didn’t do that until it was time to throw the kitchen sink at his opponents and give them looks they weren’t prepared for. To me, that suggests he didn’t believe he had the coverage players to travel.\n\nYou wonder how much the Rams’ secondary play influenced Morris’s decisions in Atlanta. Xavier Watts was the last pick in the third round of the 2025 NFL Draft, but he came into the league known as a ballhawk, and did nothing to change those preconceived notions after having five interceptions and six pass breakups as a rookie. Bates had three interceptions in 2026, but had 10 in the previous two seasons combined.\n\nMorris has zero ties to any of the players on the 49ers defense. We know he’s not going to pivot off Bosa, Warner, Williams, and Stout, but it wouldn’t be a surprise to see a change at any other position.\n\nThe coverage silos the Falcons ran last year align with the strengths of Deommodore Lenoir and Renardo Green. Neither will be exposed in man coverage against the high-level wideouts. That doesn’t mean there will be a full game when they aren’t in 1-on-1 scenarios, but Saleh to Morris should make for a simple transition on the perimeter.\n\nThis is not breaking news, but the 49ers don’t have a Bates-level safety on their roster. Malik Mustapha and Ji’Ayir Brown specialize in coming downhill and making plays near the line of scrimmage. Brown is under contract for one more season. Marques Sigle did not show he could play the ball in the air as a rookie. All of these signs point to the 49ers finding a free safety this offseason.\n\nThere are plenty of options in the draft. Judging by everything Morris asks of his safeties and where the current depth chart stands, don’t be surprised to see the Niners use their highest pick on a safety under the John Lynch-Shanahan regime. That’s the one glaring hole on this side of the ball in Morris’s scheme, especially if there will be a spike in blitz rate.",

    "fullText": "Kelluu began, as startups often do, in an old shed.\n\nThe small Finnish company makes airships — think van-sized blimps — originally designed to watch over power lines with cameras.\n\nWhen I met the firm's CEO, Janne Hietala, last fall, he arrived at our restaurant in Joensuu with news. Kelluu, a seven-year-old company, had just become a defense contractor.\n\nA NATO member had agreed to buy airships for surveillance under an alliance program pushing Western militaries to adopt new tech. The buyer hasn't been named, but it plans to integrate the airships into its military within two years.\n\nKelluu's ascent was just as rapid. The company's first showcase to NATO, Hietala said, was in November 2024.\n\nKelluu is trying to make it big in a market that hasn't been kind to small firms. Traditionally, Western nations have depended on giant contractors that meticulously take decades to create and fine-tune systems. These firms, often referred to as the \"primes,\" had all of the contacts and, by extension, all the business.\n\nBut now, the door is opening for founders from the commercial world.\n\nEvents in the last few years — the invasion of Ukraine, the second Trump administration, and the rise of drone warfare — have jolted NATO militaries, who now fear an overreliance on the primes. European generals and politicians alike agree: To convince Russia that it would lose a war, the continent needs a steady stream of ammo and equipment that can be quickly designed, tweaked, and produced in large quantities.\n\n\"It's no longer possible to just adhere to the old pace of months and years of planning, months or years of procurement, months or years of development,\" a spokesperson for Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic, or DIANA, the NATO agency that connected Kelluu with alliance members, told me.\n\nNATO conceptualized DIANA before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, as a program for emerging firms to present their tech to allied militaries and potentially sign contracts. Following the outbreak of the war, the agency was established in 2023.\n\nThe agency said it received 4,000 applications for its next cohort, up from 2,400 last year and 1,200 in its inaugural batch in 2023. At least half of these firms and founders are from Europe.\n\nInvestors who once viewed the defense sector as taboo are scouring the industry. According to the NATO Innovation Fund in February, venture capital investments in European defense tech reached $1 billion in 2024, up by four times since 2020.\n\nI traveled in the fall of 2025 to northern Europe, where concerns about war with Russia run high, to speak with defense startups finding their corner of a market that was closed to them five years ago. To make it in the old defense world, small firms typically needed to be bought by a prime.\n\nWith that barrier fading, the founders I spoke to have set their ambitions high. The European Union has a new goal of allocating $920 billion more to defense by 2030, and NATO members are raising their commitment to spending 5% of GDP on their militaries.\n\n\"No wonder that even the US investors are now looking at the European landscape, which wasn't a thing a year ago,\" Hietala said.\n\nRead this collection to get to know some of the startups seeking a slice of Europe's expanding war chest:",

    "title": "Zac Efron party photo becomes flashpoint at Alexander bros' trial as first rape accuser clashes with the defense",
    "description": "An accuser of the Alexander brothers has testified that she was raped by one the siblings in 2012 after attending a party at Zac Efron's penthouse.",
    "fullText": "The first accuser to testify in the sex-trafficking trial of ex-luxury real estate brokers Tal and Oren Alexander and their brother deftly rebuffed questions involving actor Zac Efron and her own blurry memory on Wednesday.\n\nThe woman, testifying under the pseudonym \"Katie Moore,\" was an early and key government witness in the Manhattan federal trial of Tal, Oren, and Oren's twin, Alon Alexander.\n\nShe has testified that she was drugged and raped by Alon Alexander in 2012, when she was 20 years old, at his Manhattan apartment after they attended an NBA Finals viewing party at Efron's nearby penthouse.\n\nProsecutors have alleged in an indictment that the Alexanders sometimes planned out sexual assaults, using their wealth to entice victims with the promises of luxury experiences, travel, and accommodations. The brothers have vehemently denied the charges against them, arguing that any sexual encounters were consensual.\n\nA defense lawyer for Alon Alexander pressed Moore on cross-examination on Wednesday about why she would change her profile picture on Facebook hours after the alleged rape. The photo, which Moore said Efron shot, showed her smiling at the actor's party.\n\n\"You took the time to change your Facebook profile?\" asked Alon Alexander's attorney, Howard M. Srebnick, during a second day of cross-examination for Moore.\n\n\"The only thing I could think of was it was to distract myself at that moment,\" Moore told the six-man, six-woman jury. \"Just trying to keep normalcy at a moment in my life when nothing was normal.\"\n\nEfron's name came up multiple times during Moore's testimony. At one point, Moore described herself as a \"fan\" of his and said she was excited to meet him. Efron has not been accused of any wrongdoing. Representatives for the actor did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Business Insider.\n\nMoore testified Tuesday that after the party and a visit to a nearby club with Efron and the brothers on that 2012 evening, she had awakened from being drugged to find herself naked on Alon Alexander's bed in the Manhattan apartment where Tal Alexander also lived. Alon Alexander, who was an executive at his family's private security firm, was standing over her and was also naked, she said.\n\n\"I was shocked, and I had no idea how I got there,\" Moore testified, adding that she tried two or three times to get out of the bed, but \"Alon kept pushing me back down.\"\n\nTal Alexander, she said, walked in on the alleged attack, and the brothers \"casually\" chatted.\n\nOn Wednesday, Tal Alexander's defense lawyer, Alex Kahn, questioned Moore about how long his client remained in the room during the alleged rape.\n\n\"Was he there for a moment?\" Kahn asked the accuser. \"What do you mean by a moment?\" she answered, her voice firm.\n\n\"A very short time,\" Tal Alexander's lawyer responded. \"What do you mean by a very short time?\" she asked.\n\nThe defense lawyer reframed his question, asking how long she believed his client was present in the bedroom.\n\n\"I could not quantify,\" Moore answered. \"Because I was being raped at that moment.\"\n\nAsked on Tuesday why Moore waited until 2024 to contact law enforcement — another potential weak point in the prosecution case — she said she realized that the case had become \"bigger than me.\"\n\nThe brothers, she said, had \"harmed people, including my 20-year-old self — the version of me that couldn't do anything and that felt too scared and helpless to do anything.\"\n\nMoore took the witness stand on Tuesday shortly after opening arguments kicked off in the high-profile trial.\n\nDuring those opening statements, Assistant US Attorney Madison Reddick Smyser told the jury that the Alexander brothers are sexual predators who together raped dozens of women and girls and then \"celebrated their crimes.\"\n\nThe brothers \"used whatever means necessary\" to carry out the attacks over the course of more than a decade, the prosecutor said.\n\nLater on Wednesday, a second accuser took the stand to describe a harrowing 2014 rape in the shower of a Hamptons vacation home.\n\n\"Is this how you thank me for inviting you to a beautiful home,\" a nurse from Nevada said Tal Alexander angrily told her before his alleged attack.\n\n\"As he was cleaning himself off, he looked at me and said, 'you wanted that,'\" the woman, then a 24-year-old aspiring model, told the jury. Her testimony is scheduled to continue on Thursday.\n\nThe Alexanders face several federal sex trafficking charges. If convicted at trial, Tal Alexander, 39, and the twins, 38, could face up to life behind bars.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Marco Rubio gave a full-throated defense Wednesday of President Donald Trump's military operation to oust and arrest then-Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, while also using his wide-ranging congressional testimony to touch on Greenland, NATO, Iran and China.\n\nAs Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee offered starkly different readings of the administration's foreign policy, Rubio addressed Trump's intentions and his often bellicose rhetoric that have alarmed U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere.\n\nIn the first public hearing since the Jan. 3 intervention to depose Maduro, Rubio said Trump had acted to take out a major U.S. national security threat in the Western Hemisphere. Trump's top diplomat said America was safer and more secure as a result and that the Republican administration would work with interim authorities to stabilize the South American country.\n\n“We’re not going to have this thing turn around overnight, but I think we’re making good and decent progress,” Rubio said. “We are certainly better off today in Venezuela than we were four weeks ago and I think and hope and expect that we’ll be better off in three months and six months and nine months than we would have been had Maduro still been there.\"\n\nThe former Florida senator said that Venezuela's current leaders are cooperating and would soon begin to see benefits. But he backed away from remarks prepared for the hearing that Washington would not hesitate to take further military action should those leaders not fully accept Trump's demands.\n\n“I can tell you right now with full certainty, we are not postured to nor do we intend or expect to have to take any military action in Venezuela at any time,\" Rubio said. “I think it would require the emergence of an imminent threat of the kind that we do not anticipate at this time.”\n\nHe said Venezuela soon will be allowed to sell oil that is now subject to U.S. sanctions. The revenue would be set aside to pay for basic government services such as policing and health care. Oil sale money will be deposited in a U.S. Treasury-controlled account and released after the U.S. approves monthly budgets to be submitted by Venezuela, he said.\n\nPushback against skepticism from Democrats\n\nRepublican senators, with few exceptions, praised the Venezuelan operation. Among Democrats, there was deep skepticism.\n\nThey questioned Trump's policies in Venezuela and their potential for encouraging moves by China against Taiwan and Russia even more so in Ukraine, as well as his threats to take Greenland from NATO ally Denmark and his insults about the alliance's contributions to U.S. security.\n\nHe said the uproar over Greenland within NATO is calming and that talks are underway about how to deal with Trump's demands. The Republican president insists the U.S. needs Greenland to counter threats from Russia and China, but he recently backed away from a pledge to impose tariffs on several European countries that sent troops to the semiautonomous Danish territory in a show of solidarity.\n\n“I think we’re going to get something positive done,\" Rubio said.\n\nRubio dismissed criticism that Trump was undermining the alliance, while repeating the long-running American complaint that member nations need to boost their defense budgets.\n\n“NATO needs to be reimagined.” Rubio said. “I just think this president complains about it louder than other presidents.\"\n\nHe said China's stated goal to reunify Taiwan with the mainland would not be affected by any other world event, including the Maduro operation.\n\n“The situation on Taiwan is a legacy project\" that Chinese President Xi Jinping has made \"very clear that that’s what he intends to do and that’s going to be irrespective anything that happens in the world,” Rubio said.\n\nAs Trump once more threatens Iran with military action, Rubio said there was no current plan to attack. Asked about the potential for a change of government in Tehran, Rubio said that would require “a lot of careful thinking” because it would be “far more complex” than ousting Maduro.\n\nMore details about the raid in Caracas\n\nThe committee chairman, Idaho Sen. Jim Risch, praised Trump’s decisions to remove Maduro, continue deadly military strikes on boats suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean and seize sanctioned tankers.\n\nRisch also offered new details on the operation in the Venezuelan capital, saying it involved “only about 200 troops” and a “firefight that lasted less than 27 minutes.”\n\n“This military action was incredibly brief, targeted and successful,” Risch said, adding that the U.S. and other nations may have to assist Venezuela when it seeks to restore democratic elections. ”Venezuela may require U.S. and international oversight to ensure these elections are indeed free and fair,” he said.\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the committee's top Democrat, questioned whether that operation was worth it, considering most of Maduro's top aides and lieutenants still run the Venezuela and the economic situation there remains bleak.\n\n\"We’ve traded one dictator for another, so it’s no wonder that so many of my constituents are asking, why is the president spending so much time focused on Venezuela instead of the cost of living and their kitchen table economic concerns?\" she asked. “From Venezuela to Europe, the United States is spending more, risking more and achieving less.”\n\nCongress hasn't curtailed Trump on Venezuela\n\nCongressional Democrats have condemned Trump’s moves as exceeding the authority of the executive branch, while most Republicans have supported them as a legitimate exercise of presidential power.\n\nThe GOP-led House narrowly defeated a war powers act resolution that would have directed Trump to remove U.S. troops from Venezuela. As Rubio argued, the administration says there are no U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela despite a large military buildup in the region.\n\nDemocrats contended the resolution was necessary after the U.S. raid to capture Maduro and because Trump has stated plans to control the country’s oil industry for years to come.\n\nFamilies of two Trinidadian nationals killed in an administration boat strike filed what is thought to be the first wrongful-death case arising from that campaign. Three dozen strikes on boats in the region have killed at least 126 people since September.\n\nUS acts to normalize ties while issuing warnings\n\nWhile keeping pressure on those the U.S. calls “narcotraffickers” without providing evidence, officials also are working to normalize ties with Venezuela's acting president, Delcy Rodríguez.\n\nThe administration has said its demands for Rodriguez include opening Venezuela’s energy sector to U.S. companies, providing preferential access to production, using oil revenue to purchase American goods, and ending subsidized oil exports to Cuba.\n\nRodríguez, who was Maduro's vice president, said Tuesday that her government and the U.S. “have established respectful and courteous channels of communication.” And so far, she has appeared to acquiesce to Trump’s demands and to release prisoners jailed by the government under Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez.\n\nIn a key step to the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the State Department notified Congress this week that it intends to begin sending additional diplomatic and support personnel to Caracas to prepare for the possible reopening of the U.S. Embassy, which shuttered in 2019. Fully normalizing ties, however, would require the U.S. to revoke its decision recognizing the Venezuelan parliament elected in 2015 as the country’s legitimate government.\n\nLater Wednesday, Rubio was to meet Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado at the State Department.",

    "fullText": "Lights out and away we go… on your next job application.\n\nBut for this one, put aside your CV and interview-question AI bot. To secure the job, just place first in a global autonomous drone racing competition.\n\nThat's how defense industry disruptor Anduril is recruiting for an engineering role.\n\nThe defense tech startup has launched an \"AI Grand Prix\" to find \"the boldest engineers from around the globe.\"\n\nAnduril's competition calls teams and individuals from around the globe to develop AI systems capable of piloting high-speed racing drones through professional-grade race courses with zero human control. The fastest drone to fly autonomously through a course wins.\n\n\"The competitive edge is gained entirely by optimizing the best code for the race,\" Anduril said on its website.\n\nThe \"AI Grand Prix\" kicks off in April with two virtual rounds, followed by a two-week training and physical qualifier in California in September.\n\nThe big race day will be held in November in Ohio, where Anduril is building a 5 million-square-foot factory. Arsenal-1, as the factory is known, is just outside Columbus.\n\nParticipants can compete individually or in teams of up to eight. All ages are allowed to participate, but under-17s require parental consent and won't be eligible for the job at Anduril following the competition.\n\nIf the event is won by a team, the $500,000 prize money will be split between its members, Anduril said.\n\nThe idea came from Palmer Luckey, Anduril's founder, according to the AI Grand Prix website.\n\nLuckey has long favored unconventional paths. He began taking college courses at 14 and was 19 when he dropped out of California State University to launch the virtual reality company Oculus VR in 2012.\n\nHe worked at Facebook (now Meta) before launching Anduril in 2017, alongside four co-founders, with the mission of modernizing the US military and developing autonomous weapons that \"will save Western civilization.\"\n\nLuckey's penchant for fun and games aside, unusual job campaigns are becoming a hallmark of Anduril's recruitment strategy.\n\nIn 2025, the defense tech startup ran a reverse psychology hiring campaign with the slogan \"Don't work at Anduril,\" which included a video ad that mocked nap pods, distant leadership, and the supposed lack of mission synonymous with modern tech jobs.\n\nLuckey has previously said that over-reliance on Silicon Valley types can be a trap for businesses. Talent in the Bay Area is often \"very mercenary-minded\" and more interested in résumé building than mission, he told Lulu Cheng Meservey in an interview in September 2025.\n\nAnduril deliberately recruits nationwide and makes a point of hiring armed forces veterans, Luckey said.\n\nAnduril's recruitment drive is likely to pick up. The startup is valued at $30.5 billion as of June 2025, and is considering an IPO in 2026.\n\nAs the United States races to modernize warfare, Luckey's company has emerged as the face of the defense tech boom and proved it can compete for contracts with legacy defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Boeing.\n\nAnduril did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours.",

    "title": "Pre-spring Michigan Football depth chart prediction: Defense",
    "description": "Michigan Football’s defense will look plenty different at all three levels in 2026. Here’s our prediction of what the depth chart looks like entering the spring:",
    "fullText": "It’s been quite the whirlwind over the last couple of weeks for the Michigan Football program, as it has seen plenty of players and personnel come and go, shaping things up to look much different than the last two seasons. On the defensive side of the ball, defensive coordinator Jay Hill takes over for Wink Martindale, while a host of new players were added to fill out the roster.\n\nYesterday, we took a look at how the offensive depth chart is looking prior to spring ball. Today, we’ll be taking a look at the defense.\n\nAs a note, incoming freshmen are only included below if they are enrolling early.\n\nStarters: Trey Pierce, Enow Etta\n\nDepth: Jonah Lea’ea, Manuel Beigel, Deyvid Palepale, Chibi Anwunah, Travis Moten, Bobby Kanka\n\nMichigan’s front seven depth is looking pretty thin as of now, but it does get a pair of key players back in Trey Pierce and Enow Etta. The previous coaching staff raved about them and have been hidden amidst some crowded rotations the last two seasons, but both could be poised for breakout campaigns in 2026.\n\nThe biggest addition to the room through the portal was Utah’s Jonah Lea’ea. He was a starter last year in a breakout season where he had 38 tackles, one sack and one forced fumble. Look for him to play a big role for Michigan even if he’s not getting the most snaps of the group.\n\nBehind Lea’ea, there are a handful of players that haven’t seen big roles in college yet. Manuel Beigel is perhaps the most experienced of the group, appearing in three games in 2025, while Deyvid Palepale appeared in two. Redshirt freshmen Travis Moten and Bobby Kanka, are also back to try and take a step in their development.\n\nMichigan should get some relief at this position in the summer when talented four-stars Alister Vallejo and Titan Davis join the program.\n\nStarters: John Henry Daley, Cam Brandt\n\nDepth: Nate Marshall, Dominic Nichols, Lugard Edokpayi, McHale Blade, Benny Patterson, Julius Holly\n\nSimilarly along the edge, there’s not much depth here right now, but there are still some solid contributors near the top of the depth chart. John Henry Daley was arguably the biggest addition Michigan made in the portal after recording 11.5 sacks and earning first-team All-American honors at Utah last year. An injury could complicate his offseason, but he’ll be the favorite to lead the rotation in the fall.\n\nNext up is Cam Brandt, who appears poised to take over a starting role after being a rotational piece his first few years. He made one start in 2025 and made 22 tackles, but he had three sacks the year prior. Right behind him is Nate Marshall, who has a ton of upside and could push for a starting job if he has a big offseason. The same could be said for Dominic Nichols, as he should be able to develop even more with defensive ends coach Lewis Powell.\n\nFurther down the depth chart, you’ll find Lugard Edokpayi, Benny Patterson and Julius Holly, a pair of returning players who have yet to contribute much so far. McHale Blade is a talented freshman that will look to make some noise in the spring as well. Michigan is also set to add five-star Carter Meadows and three-star Tariq Boney in the summer. Lea’ea could see snaps here as well.\n\nStarters – Troy Bowles, Nathaniel Staehling\n\nDepth – Nathaniel Owusu-Boateng, Chase Taylor, Max Alford, Aisea Moa, Christian Pierce, Kaden Catchings, Markel Dabney, Aden Reeder\n\nYou might as well put the shrug emoji here, but the good news is there are plenty of bodies, which means strong competition this offseason. I think it’s safe to lean into Troy Bowles and Nathaniel Staehling as the starters heading into the spring due to their experience. Staehling recorded 74 tackles and three interceptions for FCS powerhouse North Dakota State last year, while Bowles got regular reps and showed some flashes when Jimmy Rolder and Cole Sullivan were out with injuries.\n\nIf it’s upside you’re looking for, sophomores Nathaniel Owusu-Boateng and Chase Taylor are your guys. Owusu-Boateng came to Michigan as a strong, albeit undersized athlete that was probably going to have to wait until 2026 to make major contributions; Taylor was also a player that got praise during fall camp last year. Michigan also brought in transfers Max Alford, Aisea Moa and Christian Pierce to compete as well.\n\nFinally, Kaden Catchings, Markel Dabney and Aden Reeder are all early enrollees that will start their careers and development this spring.\n\nStarters – Jyaire Hill, Zeke Berry, Smith Snowden (nickel)\n\nDepth – Shamari Earls, Jo’Ziah Edmond, Salesi Moa, Jeremiah Lowe, Jamarion Vincent\n\nMichigan’s cornerback room took a hit this offseason with the losses of promising freshmen Elijah Dotson and Jayden Sanders, but made a huge addition with Utah’s Smith Snowden. He was second-team All-Big 12 last season and slots right in as the starting nickel. The Wolverines also got Jyaire Hill and Zeke Berry back, who will each start for the third consecutive year to give Michigan a trio of talented corners at the top of the depth chart.\n\nNext up is Shamari Earls, who came to Ann Arbor as a prized recruit last year. He didn’t see the field much, but he’ll have the chance to take a second-year leap under new cornerbacks coach Jernaro Gilford. Similarly, Jo’Ziah Edmonds didn’t see the field much in 2025 but was a four-star recruit that has potential.\n\nFurther down the depth chart, star freshman Salesi Moa could factor in here depending on how the coaching staff plans to split him between offense and defense. Jeremiah Lowe and Jamarion Vincent — the latter being an early enrollee — will also battle it out to rise on the depth chart.\n\nStarters – Chris Bracy, Rod Moore\n\nDepth – Jordan Young, Mason Curtis, Kainoa Winston, Jacob Oden, Taylor Tatum, Jordan Deck\n\nMuch like cornerback, the safety position saw some attrition this portal season, as T.J. Metcalf, Brandyn Hillman and Jaden Mangham all left. However, Michigan did well to add Chris Bracy from Memphis, who racked up 81 tackles and 9.5 tackles for a loss last year — he should slot in as a starter alongside Rod Moore, who will be back for a sixth year and is hopefully healthy following his lengthy knee injury.\n\nJordan Young took big steps throughout his true freshman year and while he might not have done enough to secure a starting job, he should still get plenty of snaps. Mason Curtis should also play a bigger role next season.\n\nMichigan doesn’t really have much experience further down the depth chart, with Jacob Oden and Kainoa Winston likely the next guys up. Additionally, Michigan is reportedly moving Oklahoma running back transfer Taylor Tatum to safety, while freshman early enrollee Jordan Deck will compete for playing time as well.",

    "title": "Ukraine's new 35-year-old defense minister made 2 influential Telegram bloggers his advisors for drone warfare",
    "description": "In a major shift for Ukraine's military, Serhii \"Flash\" Beskrestnov and Serhii Sternenko are now officially advising Kyiv on defense tech and drones.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's new defense minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, has appointed two prominent Telegram bloggers and activists to his \"team of new leaders,\" saying they will advise him on defense technology and drone warfare.\n\nThe move is a major recognition for the pair — Serhii \"Flash\" Beskrestnov and Serhii Sternenko — who are among the most influential voices among the volunteers filling vital gaps in logistics and drone expertise for Ukraine's battered military.\n\nBeskrestnov, widely cited among Ukrainians as an expert on drones, runs a Telegram channel with some 156,000 followers, where he publicly analyzes Russian and Ukrainian battle drones and how they've performed.\n\nFedorov named him an advisor in defense technology on Sunday, saying Beskrestnov would focus on helping Ukraine build counter-systems for Russian strike and reconnaissance drones.\n\nIn his statement, Fedorov said that Beskrestnov would also support Ukraine's military in analyzing Russian tech, studying \"logistics, study of enemy solutions, and leveraging this experience to our advantage.\"\n\nSternenko, a political activist who now runs an organization that raises funds for military drones, was appointed as Fedorov's advisor on Thursday.\n\n\"From now on, Serhii will act as my advisor on enhancing the use of UAVs at the frontline. His experience will help us implement our shared vision of improving the effectiveness of units operating unmanned systems,\" Fedorov said.\n\nThe Sternenko Foundation serves as a hub for drone procurement, raising money to buy specialized first-person-view drones for military units that demonstrate they're combat-effective.\n\nAs of Monday, it says it has delivered over 256,000 drones on demand to Ukrainian units.\n\nFedorov, Ukraine's youngest-ever defense minister at 35, previously was the country's minister for digital transformation. Since being confirmed to his new role earlier this month, he's pledged to revitalize Ukraine's military, promising to reform its training programs, internal culture, and organizational doctrine.\n\nAppointing Sternenko and Beskrestnov as advisors is a significant change in how Kyiv treats its grassroots movements. These groups work closely with Ukrainian forces, but top authorities have generally been slow to officially recognize or integrate them.\n\nSeveral frontline units previously told Business Insider that they sometimes rely on the Sternenko Foundation, for example, for drones that can effectively cope with Russian electronic warfare. While the Ukrainian military provides its fighters with drones in bulk, these sometimes need further tweaks as the battlefield evolves rapidly.\n\nVolunteer foundations often step in and have become known for their speed, leveraging connections with drone manufacturers and informal logistics networks to deliver priority supplies, vehicles, and modified drones within hours or days.\n\nFedorov said that Sternenko would particularly assist in establishing basic support for drone units, adding that 50 of Ukraine's 400 units account for 70% of its battlefield engagements.\n\n\"The objective is to enable the other 350 units to grow quickly and significantly increase the scale of destroying Russian forces,\" Fedorov said.\n\nBeskrestnov, meanwhile, regularly publicizes news about Russia's Shahed-type drones. He often posts footage from found wreckage to show how the Kremlin has been modifying or upgrading the loitering munitions.\n\nFedorov's team credited the drone analyst for being the \"first to report on the use by Russians of FPV drones equipped with machine vision, as well as the use of jet-powered Shahed drones.\"\n\nThe new defense minister's attempt to reshape Ukraine's military comes as it grapples with a slew of challenges, including heightened fighting intensity on the front lines in recent months and a withdrawal of most US miliary support.\n\nIn his opening speech to Ukraine's parliament, Fedorov said the country was facing a high rate of desertion and draft dodging, and that the military's budget had shrunk since last year.",

    "description": "All they have to do is sign a contract to fight in Ukraine.  As Russia seeks to replenish its forces in nearly four years of war — and avoid an unpopular nationwide mobilization — it's pulling out all the stops to find new troops to send into the battlefield.  After signing a mutual defense treaty with Moscow in 2024, North Korea sent thousands of soldiers to help Russia defend its Kursk region from a Ukrainian incursion.",
    "fullText": "For average wage earners in Russia, it's a big payday. For criminals seeking to escape the harsh conditions and abuse in prison, it's a chance at freedom. For immigrants hoping for a better life, it's a simplified path to citizenship.\n\nAll they have to do is sign a contract to fight in Ukraine.\n\nAs Russia seeks to replenish its forces in nearly four years of war — and avoid an unpopular nationwide mobilization — it's pulling out all the stops to find new troops to send into the battlefield.\n\nSome come from abroad to fight in what has become a bloody war of attrition. After signing a mutual defense treaty with Moscow in 2024, North Korea sent thousands of soldiers to help Russia defend its Kursk region from a Ukrainian incursion.\n\nMen from South Asian countries, including India, Nepal and Bangladesh, complain of being duped into signing up to fight by recruiters promising jobs. Officials in Kenya, South Africa and Iraq say the same has happened to citizens from their countries.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin told his annual news conference last month that 700,000 Russian troops are fighting in Ukraine. He gave the same number in 2024, and a slightly lower figure – 617,000 – in December 2023. It's unclear if those numbers are accurate.\n\nStill hidden are the numbers of military casualties, with Moscow having released limited official figures. The British Defense Ministry said last summer that more than 1 million Russian troops may have been killed or wounded.\n\nIndependent Russian news site Mediazona, together with the BBC and a team of volunteers, scoured news reports, social media and government websites and collected the names of over 160,000 troops killed. More than 550 of those were foreigners from over two dozen countries.\n\nUnlike Ukraine, where martial law and nationwide mobilization has been in place since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Putin has resisted ordering a broad call-up.\n\nWhen a limited mobilization of 300,000 men was tried later that year, tens of thousands of people fled abroad. The effort stopped after a few weeks when the target was met, but a Putin decree left the door open for another call-up. It also made all military contracts effectively open-ended and barred soldiers from quitting service or being discharged, unless they reached certain age limits or were incapacitated by injuries.\n\nSince then, Moscow has largely relied on what it describes as voluntary enlistment.\n\nThe flow of voluntary enlistees signing military contracts has remained strong, topping 400,000 last year, Putin said in December. It was not possible to independently verify the claim. Similar numbers were announced in 2024 and 2023.\n\nActivists say these contracts often stipulate a fixed term of service, such as one year, leading some potential enlistees to believe the commitment is temporary. But contracts are automatically extended indefinitely, they say.\n\nThe government offers high pay and extensive benefits to enlistees. Regional authorities offer various enlistment bonuses, sometimes amounting to tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nIn the Khanty-Mansi region of central Russia, for example, an enlistee would get about $50,000 in various bonuses, according to the local government. That's more than twice the average annual income in the region, where monthly salaries in the first 10 months of 2025 were reported to be just over $1,600.\n\nThere also are tax breaks, debt relief and other perks.\n\nDespite Kremlin claims of relying on voluntary enlistment, media reports and rights groups say conscripts — men aged 18-30 performing fixed-term mandatory military service and exempted from being sent to Ukraine — are often coerced by superiors into signing contracts that send them into battle.\n\nRecruitment also extends to prisoners and those in pretrial detention centers, a practice led early in the war by the late mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin and adopted by the Defense Ministry. Laws now allow recruitment of both convicts and suspects in criminal cases.\n\nForeigners also are recruiting targets, both inside Russia and abroad.\n\nLaws were adopted offering accelerated Russian citizenship for enlistees. Russian media and activists also report that raids in areas where migrants typically live or work lead to them being pressuring into military service, with new citizens sent to enlistment offices to determine if they’re eligible for mandatory service.\n\nIn November, Putin decreed that military service was mandatory for certain foreigners seeking permanent residency.\n\nSome reportedly are lured to Russia by trafficking rings promising jobs, then duping them into signing military contracts. Cuban authorities in 2023 identified and sought to dismantle one such ring operating from Russia.\n\nNepal’s Foreign Minister Narayan Prakash Saud told The Associated Press in 2024 that his country asked Russia to return hundreds of Nepali nationals who were recruited to fight in Ukraine, as well as to repatriate the remains of those killed in the war. Nepal has since barred citizens from traveling to Russia or Ukraine for work, citing recruitment efforts.\n\nAlso in 2024, India’s federal investigation agency said it broke up a network that lured at least 35 of its citizens to Russia under the pretext of employment. The men were trained for combat and deployed to Ukraine against their will, with some \"grievously injured,” the agency said.\n\nWhen Putin hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for talks in 2024, New Delhi said its nationals who were “misled” into joining the Russian army would be discharged.\n\nIraqi officials say about 5,000 of its citizens have joined the Russian military along with an unspecified number who are fighting alongside Ukrainian forces. Officials in Baghdad cracked down on such recruiting networks, with one man convicted last year of human trafficking and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nAn unknown number of Iraqis have been killed or gone missing while fighting in Ukraine. Some families have reported that relatives were lured to Russia under false pretenses and forced to enlist; in other cases, Iraqis have joined voluntarily for the salary and Russian citizenship.\n\nForeigners duped into fighting are especially vulnerable because they don’t speak Russian, have no military experience and are deemed “dispensable, to put it bluntly,” by military commanders, said Anton Gorbatsevich of the activist group Idite Lesom, or “Get Lost,” which helps men desert from the army.\n\nThis month, a Ukrainian agency for the treatment of prisoners of war said over 18,000 foreign nationals had fought or are fighting on the Russian side. Almost 3,400 have been killed, and hundreds of citizens of 40 countries are held in Ukraine as POWs.\n\nIf true, that represents a fraction of the 700,000 troops that Putin said are fighting for Russia in Ukraine.\n\nUsing foreigners is only one way to meet the constant demand, said Artyom Klyga, head of the legal department at the Movement of Conscientious Objectors, noting Russian recruitment efforts appear to be stable. Most of those seeking help from the group, which assists men in avoiding military service, are Russian citizens, he said.\n\nKateryna Stepanenko, a Russia researcher at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, said the Kremlin has gotten more “creative” in the last two years with attracting enlistees, including foreigners.\n\nBut recruitment efforts are becoming “extremely expensive” for Russia, which faces a slowing economy, she added.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOne advanced metric places the 2025–26 Seattle Seahawks defense among the greatest units in NFL history. That metric is DVOA, which stands for “Defense-adjusted Value Over Average.”\n\nDVOA measures a team’s efficiency by comparing the success of every single play to a league average, adjusted for situation and quality of opponent. In simpler terms, it evaluates how good a team truly is while accounting for context — down, distance, game situation, and who they’re playing.\n\nAaron Schatz, the chief analytics officer of FTN Fantasy and the creator of DVOA, recently shared a list of the best defenses by the metric dating back to 1978. Including playoff performances, this year’s Seahawks defense ranks sixth all-time in DVOA — a remarkable achievement considering the volume of elite units over the past four decades.\n\nHere's where the #Seahawks stand among the top teams in DVOA history, including the playoffs. Regular-season ratings are also included. pic.twitter.com/q9MEUiju83\n\n— Aaron Schatz 🏈 (@ASchatzNFL) January 26, 2026\n\nMORE: Report: Rams, Seahawks coaches nearly came to blows in elevator\n\nThe only defenses ranked ahead of Seattle are some of the most legendary teams the league has ever seen:\n\n1991–92 Washington Commanders — Super Bowl champions\n\n1985–86 Chicago Bears — Super Bowl champions and the iconic “Super Bowl Shuffle” team\n\n2007–08 New England Patriots — lost the Super Bowl to Eli Manning and the Giants after an undefeated regular season\n\n1989–90 San Francisco 49ers — Super Bowl champions following a dominant 55–10 victory\n\n1996–97 Green Bay Packers — led by Reggie White and Super Bowl winners\n\nJust behind Seattle at No. 7 are the 2023–24 Baltimore Ravens, who fell to Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC championship. The defensive coordinator for that Ravens team? Current Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald, adding another layer of intrigue to Seattle’s historic ranking.\n\nMORE: Seahawks fans will love these 11 Super Bowl predictions from ESPN\n\nTo cement their place in NFL lore, the Seahawks still have one final hurdle: Super Bowl Sunday. Standing in their way are the Patriots, a franchise back on the league’s biggest stage just a few years removed from a two-decade run of dominance. New England boasts one of the NFL’s most explosive offenses and an MVP candidate at quarterback in Drake Maye.\n\nIf Seattle’s defense can slow down offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels’ attack and deliver one more elite performance, it will not just bring a Lombardi Trophy — it could elevate this unit into the top five defenses of all time.\n\nHow Seahawks could end up trading Sam Darnold this offseason despite Super Bowl appearance\n\nWill Sam Darnold get an extension this offseason?

    "description": "Michael Strnad, 33, has scored a bigger wealth gain than anyone except Elon Musk this year after his defense company went public on Friday.",
    "fullText": "A millennial defense chief has racked up more wealth in the first few weeks of 2026 than anyone except Elon Musk.\n\nMichal Strnad, 33, has grown $22 billion richer since the start of January, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows. Only the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, who is up $70 billion year to date, has built more wealth over that period.\n\nStrnad's net worth has soared 150% to $37 billion in less than a month, vaulting him into 64th place on the rich list. He's now wealthier than Facebook cofounder Eduardo Saverin, SoftBank chief Masayoshi Son, and steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal.\n\nHis wealth surge was sparked by the listing of his company, Czechoslovak Group, in Amsterdam on Friday. CSG secured a public valuation north of $30 billion with Strnad selling about $3 billion worth of his shares in the IPO, paring his ownership from virtually 100% to 85%.\n\nAs a defense executive in his 30s, Strnad stands out among the 10 greatest wealth gainers this year, many of whom are much older and have software fortunes. That list includes Interactive Brokers founder Thomas Peterffy, 81, and Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, both 52.\n\nBloomberg updated Strnad's net worth based on his CSG stake. It previously relied on CSG's financials and its defense peers' valuation multiples.\n\nCSG's website shows it started as Excalibur Army, a company founded by Strnad's father in 1995 to manufacture land equipment for military, police, and emergency services.\n\nStrnad joined the business in 2011, became CEO in 2013, and took ownership in 2018. He has broadened CSG's focus and footprint: it now employs over 14,000 people across eight countries and operates in the auto, aerospace, railway, and defense industries.\n\nCSG has expanded largely through acquisitions, including Tatra Trucks, shotgun-maker Perazzi, and The Kinetic Group, which owns the Federal and Remington ammo brands.\n\nStrnad's company also owns a training academy for helicopter pilots and ground personnel in Slovakia, runs a munitions plant in Spain, and holds a license from General Dynamics' European arm to build Pandur armored vehicles.\n\nDefense stocks have outperformed in recent years thanks to greater defense-spending commitments from governments, and the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Gaza conflicts boosting demand for military equipment.",

    "description": "A Pentagon watchdog found confusing counter-drone policies are leaving some US military bases vulnerable to drone incursions.",
    "fullText": "A Pentagon watchdog report is warning that gaps in Pentagon policy are leaving some US military bases vulnerable to drone threats.\n\nThe report, released Tuesday by the Pentagon's Inspector General, said that the military lacks consistent guidance for defending sensitive \"covered assets\" — US-based sites legally authorized to use certain counter-drone defenses — against offensive uncrewed aircraft, a problem exacerbated by jumbled, contradictory policies across the services.\n\nWhile the Defense Department has issued multiple counter-UAS policies — rules governing how the military can detect, disrupt, or disable uncrewed aerial systems — those directives are not standardized, leaving some base leaders unaware that their installations qualify as \"covered assets.\" The term refers to locations within the US that deal with sensitive missions like nuclear deterrence, missile defense, presidential protection, air defense, and \"high yield\" explosives.\n\nThat lack of awareness derived from confusing policy risks leaving bases exposed to uncrewed threats, a growing concern.\n\nThe Inspector General report examines 10 military installations where drone incursions have occurred. The watchdog assessment found multiple examples of \"covered assets\" left uncovered due to unclear policies.\n\nThe Air Force base in Arizona where most F-35 pilots are trained, for instance, is not authorized to defend against UAS incursions because pilot training does not qualify as a \"covered\" activity under Pentagon policy, despite the Air Force describing the F-35 as \"an indispensable tool in future homeland defense.\"\n\nAnother Air Force facility in California that manufactures aircraft repair parts, conducts aircraft maintenance, and makes the Global Hawk, an ultra-advanced large surveillance drone that costs more than the F-35A, has also been left vulnerable, and the site experienced a series of drone incursions in 2024, the report said.\n\n\"Air Force officials told us that the government-owned, contractor-operated facility was denied coverage during the active incursions,\" in 2024, the IG report says.\n\nThe problem extends beyond determining whether a site is covered. The process for obtaining counter-drone systems — and securing rapid legal approval to use them when needed — is complex and slow, reflecting legal restrictions on using electronic jamming or force inside the US, the report found.\n\nConcerns about drone threats to military installations have grown in recent years as small, inexpensive commercial drones have become dramatically more popular and easy to use. Such systems lower the barrier to entry on surveillance and precision strike from the state level to non-state actors and can create challenges for security personnel who are often constrained in their response options, or improperly trained and equipped to react.\n\nIn 2024, multiple bases within the US and abroad experienced strings of drone incursions, events that can involve one or more unmanned aircraft entering restricted airspace or operating close enough to installations to trigger alarms, even when the drones are not linked to foreign adversaries.\n\n\"In recent years, adversary unmanned systems have evolved rapidly,\" a Department of Defense counter-drone strategy released in the final months of the Biden administration said. \"These cheap systems are increasingly changing the battlefield, threatening US installations, and wounding or killing our troops.\"\n\nEfforts to address the drone problem have been in the works for years, though a Center for New American Security report released last September said the military's efforts were \"hindered by insufficient scale and urgency.\"\n\nSome units have received counter-drone tools such as portable \"flyaway kits\" — deployable systems meant to be moved quickly between sites — and the \"Dronebuster,\" a handheld electronic-warfare device that emits a signal to disrupt or disable an offending drone. The Army secretary recently questioned the latter system's effectiveness, underscoring broader uncertainty about how best to defend US bases from the growing drone threat.\n\nThe US military is trying to catch up with the threat, to develop defenses as fast or faster than drone technology is currently developing, driven in large part by the drone-dominant Ukraine war. As he announced the creation of Joint Interagency Task Force 401 last August, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said \"there's no doubt that the threats we face today from hostile drones grow by the day.\"\n\n\"The challenge for airspace management is how to deter or defeat such incursions without endangering the surrounding civilian communities or legitimate air traffic. That rules out everything kinetic,\" Mark Cancian, a defense expert and retired US Marine Corps colonel, told Business Insider in late 2024 during a series of incursions.\n\n\"This has become a huge problem for both military and civilian airfields and will get worse and drone usage proliferates further,\" he said.",

    "description": "Let’s take a look at the coaches who seem most likely to run John Harbaugh’s defense.",
    "fullText": "The New York Giants are continuing to search for a defensive coordinator for John Harbaugh’s defense. Here is some background on four candidates who are continually mentioned.\n\nThe 45-year-old former Miami Dolphins’ defensive coordinator seems like the leader in the clubhouse for the Giants’ job. Except for all of those pesky head-coaching interviews he keeps getting.\n\nThere are currently five head-coaching openings remaining in this hiring cycle — Buffalo Bills, Pittsburgh Steelers, Cleveland Browns, Arizona Cardinals, Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nWeaver has interest from the Steelers and Bills for their vacancies. He interviewed with the Steelers in-person on Friday. He received an interview request from the Cardinals, but it is not clear that ever took place. He interviewed with the Atlanta Falcons before they hired Kevin Stefanski, and had two interviews with the Baltimore Ravens before they chose Jesse Minter.\n\nWeaver was defensive coordinator of the Houston Texans in 2020, and the Miami Dolphins for the past two seasons. He was in Baltimore working for Harbaugh as defensive line coach for three seasons, 2021-2023.\n\nWeaver started his NFL coaching career in 2012 working under Rex Ryan with the New York Jets. He has also coach with the Cleveland Browns and Buffalo Bills.\n\nWeaver, a defensive tackle as a player, was a second-round pick by the Ravens in 2002 and had a seven-year NFL career with Baltimore and Houston.\n\nThere is no doubt how Harbaugh feels about him. Here is what Harbaugh said about Weaver before the Dolphins hired him away from the Ravens to be defensive coordinator in 2024:\n\nHere’s what Ravens coach John Harbaugh said about Anthony Weaver. He spoke rather glowingly about him.pic.twitter.com/Vf8Ry4YJOv https://t.co/yS1KH9ESBR\n\n— David Furones (@DavidFurones_) February 2, 2024\n\nLeonhard, 43, has never coached for a Harbaugh — John or Jim. He did play for John Harbaugh in 2008, Harbaugh’s first as Ravens’ head coach.\n\nLeonhard played in the NFL for 10 seasons. He coached at Wisconsin from 2016-2022, serving as defensive coordinator beginning in 2017. He joined Sean Payton’s Denver Broncos staff in 2024 and has spent the last two seasons working under Payton and Vance Joseph. He has been defensive backs coach, pass game coordinator, and in 2025 was the Broncos’ assistant head coach.\n\nThe problem for Leonhard might be timing. The Senior Bowl begins on Tuesday in Mobile, Ala., and there is a belief that the Giants would like to have their offensive and defensive coordinators in place by then if possible.\n\nLeonhard’s Broncos play Sunday in the AFC Championship Game. If they win and go to the Super Bowl, that timeline won’t work. Even if they lose, Leonhard would have to interview, be offered and accept the job on Monday and join the Giants’ contingent on Tuesday in Alabama.\n\nThe 43-year-old Wilson is familiar to Harbaugh, and to the Giants. Wilson was Harbaugh’s defensive backs coach in Baltimore in 2023 before becoming Tennessee Titans defensive coordinator for the 2024 and 2025 seasons. Wilson also interviewed for the Giants’ job in 2024, but chose to take the Tennessee job.\n\nWilson’s defenses in Tennessee did not rank highly, but the Titans won just six games in two seasons and Wilson didn’t have a lot to work with.\n\nWilson had a supporter in Tennessee star defender Jeffery Simmons:\n\nJeffery Simmons understands it's not up to him BUT if he has it his way, he'd love to have Dennard Wilson back with the #Titans. pic.twitter.com/Kc4Qhxurko\n\n— TURRON DAVENPORT (@TDavenport_NFL) December 31, 2025\n\nWilson interviewed with the Los Angeles Chargers, coached by Jim Harbaugh, for their defensive coordinator vacancy on Friday.\n\nJones, defensive backs coach and defensive pass game coordinator for the Minnesota Vikings, is probably an underdog for the job.\n\nJones did interview with Harbaugh earlier in the week. He also interviewed for the Giants’ job in 2024.\n\nJones’ NFL resume includes stops with the Miami Dolphins, Cincinnati Bengals, and two stints with the Vikings. Jones has also coached in high school, at the Division II level, in the FCS, FBS, and in the Canadian Football League.\n\nJones has also drawn interest from the Dallas Cowboys , New York Jets, and Green Bay Packers.",

    "fullText": "Trinity Rodman has been called a generational talent. Not necessarily because she is the best in the world — three-time Ballon d’Or winner Aitana Bonmati is still at the top of that list — but because of what she offers as a whole.\n\nFrom her signature, defense-splitting “Trin Spin” move on the field to her entertaining and profitable presence off it, keeping Rodman in the National Women’s Soccer League was so crucial to the current trajectory of women’s soccer in America that the league changed its rules to ensure it happened.\n\nThe reality is that Rodman could have walked away. The 23-year-old’s previous contract with the Washington Spirit ended on Dec. 31. She had options from Europe, including from Chelsea, which has been willing to splash some cash on U.S. players. But she stuck it out with her team and her city, even after a previous agreement vetoed by the league sparked arguments about the NWSL’s salary-cap rules.\n\nRodman was rewarded for that loyalty with one of the biggest salaries in women’s soccer history. She will take home more than $2 million a year for the next three years, benefitting from a change in league rules to allow such spending.\n\n“Getting drafted here and developing and maturing and learning and failing at Spirit and in D.C., it’s become so much of my legacy and my story. But on top of that, I still feel like there’s so much more I have to give and so much more that I want to do,” Rodman said during her contract signing ceremony on Thursday.\n\nMany will claim credit for finally ending the mind-boggling saga around keeping the superstar in the league, but the rich soccer community in Washington, D.C., should not go overlooked. Thursday was a welcome reminder of the anomaly that is women’s soccer, where the love of the game can still sometimes outweigh balance sheets.\n\nOwner Michele Kang’s willingness to pay a player what she’s worth and Rodman’s persistence in demanding nothing less were only successful when paired with the growing relationship between the team and its fans.\n\nTo understand how that connection became so strong — and how it might be emulated elsewhere — you have to go back to the beginning.\n\nThe Spirit selected Rodman No. 2 in the 2021 draft. At the time, Kang, who now owns professional women’s teams on three continents, was only a minority investor. While there was plenty of excitement around the young prospect, whose surname was already synonymous with championships in another sport thanks to her father, soccer took a backseat to off-field issues months ahead of the postseason.\n\nIn September 2021, the Spirit fired head coach Richie Burke following allegations of emotional and verbal harassment. Shortly after, the Spirit had to forfeit two games for violating the league’s COVID-19 policy. Majority owner Steve Baldwin, who was accused of allowing Burke to quietly step away rather than force a more public vetting of the allegations surrounding his coach, battled with Kang for control of the team. Kang called for Baldwin to step down and sell his shares to her.\n\nWithout protection from the front office, the drama seeped into the players’ day-to-day work, and they eventually called for Baldwin to sell his stake in the team to Kang. Following the COVID forfeits, the team lost just twice in the last 13 games and won the club’s first NWSL Championship. Rodman, for her part, won rookie of the year.\n\nBaldwin eventually agreed to sell for $35 million, more than seven times the team’s valuation at the time. However, it wasn’t until March 30, 2022, that Kang was finally able to gain control of the club.\n\nLeaders such as midfielder Andi Sullivan and goalkeeper Aubrey Kingsbury, who consistently fielded questions about the off-field obstacles, are still key parts of the team’s leadership in 2026. That matters. The fans who stuck by the players matter, too.\n\nThe Spirit’s home, Audi Field, has earned the name “Rowdy Audi” after three seasons of record attendance, which reached an average of 10,866 in 2023, 13,940 in 2024 and 15,110 in 2025. With sellouts becoming commonplace, it’s easy to forget that before 2023, the Spirit spent many home games at small venues more than an hour outside the city, sometimes with less than 10,000-seat capacity.\n\n“The fan base, the stadium, you can’t (compare) — even other NWSL teams (don’t) get these amount of fans,” Rodman said. “I feel it, and you see it with all the interactions I have. I wouldn’t trade it for the world.”\n\nIn 2021, the players rallied around each other, and the fans rallied around the players. In 2025, that support has grown by the thousands. Rodman is without a doubt part of that growth, and she bears that responsibility openly.\n\nAfter the Spirit defeated Racing Louisville in the 2025 NWSL quarterfinals, Rodman sprinted to the wall of supporters to celebrate. It had been her first game back since a minor MCL sprain kept her out of the previous playoff match and regular-season finale. Likely to the dismay of a nearby athletic trainer, Rodman hopped into the stands alongside teammate Esme Morgan and waved the supporters’ massive flag to erupting cheers. She made a similar show of respect after the team’s semifinal win over the Portland Thorns, their final home game of the season. The win helped Washington reach its second final in as many years.\n\nThat moment illustrated the importance of the community the Spirit have created.\n\nFive years ago, Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe were the names synonymous with soccer in America and women’s soccer as a whole. Now, Rodman has taken that crown, even if she spent much of last year sidelined by injuries. In all, she played 17 games and scored five goals. Yet when she came on the field in the NWSL Championship, PayPal Park in San Jose, Calif. reached its loudest decibel level of the night.\n\nThe 23-year-old Olympic gold medalist has endured seven club coaches, multiple home venues and new ownership. Throughout it all, she’s helped build a soccer power.\n\nKang and other team executives made clear last Thursday how much those fans matter. They brought up an elementary school student and Spirit supporter named Emma to deliver Rodman’s new contract. Rodman embraced Emma — and her pink box braids that mirrored Rodman’s iconic look from the 2024 Olympics — and talked about how she wants to use her extended time with the Spirit to give back to the youth in D.C.\n\nCynically, it could be seen as a marketing move to sell more tickets. With private equity and skyrocketing valuations becoming a bigger part of the women’s game, not every gesture can be taken at face value. Kang, who owns London City Lioness in England and OL Lyonnes in France, is among the owners whose motives have been questioned. Women’s soccer has gone overlooked and mistreated for so long that scar tissue remains.\n\nHowever, Thursday showed what happens when the community aspect of women’s soccer is not just embraced, but invested in.\n\n“I can’t think about the Washington Spirit without her,” Kang said. “I hope she can’t think about her career without Washington Spirit.”\n\nRodman could have walked away. Instead, she made it abundantly clear that she wanted to stay, for the team, the fans and herself.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nUS Women's national team, Washington Spirit, NWSL, Women's Soccer\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — A lawyer for fired University of Michigan football coach Sherrone Moore declared his innocence Thursday and said charges of home invasion and stalking were based on an effort by a staff member to get a financial windfall from the school's “deep pockets.\"\n\nIn a court filing, defense attorney Ellen Michaels responded to allegations that shocked college football in December. It also signals that Moore, who was fired for a relationship with the staffer and arrested hours later, is fighting the charges and wants the case dismissed.\n\n“This Court is not confronted with a close call or a technical defect,” Michaels wrote. “It is confronted with a prosecution that never should have begun.”\n\nMoore was abruptly fired on Dec. 10 for having an inappropriate relationship and for lying during the university's investigation, his dismissal letter states.\n\nAuthorities say Moore later that day entered the woman’s apartment, blamed her for the firing and grabbed butter knives and kitchen scissors while threatening to kill himself.\n\nA prosecutor quoted Moore as telling the woman, “My blood is on your hands.”\n\nMoore, 39, has pleaded not guilty to charges of felony home invasion, stalking and illegal entry.\n\nMichaels said the warrant to arrest Moore was deeply flawed because police wrongly informed a magistrate that Moore had been stalking the woman for months and was dangerous.\n\nMichaels said police relied on misinformation from the woman's personal lawyer, Heidi Sharp, as it investigated what happened. Michaels doesn't dispute that Moore turned up at the woman's apartment, but she claims there's no evidence that she had told him to stay away.\n\n“A magistrate must be given a fair and accurate picture. When the picture is distorted, the warrant cannot stand,” Michaels wrote.\n\nShe accused Sharp of giving information to police to “villainize Mr. Moore and maximize the chances of obtaining a large settlement from the deep pockets of the University of Michigan.”\n\nA message seeking comment from Sharp was not immediately returned.\n\nEarlier Thursday, a judge held a hearing to get an update on the case. Michaels disclosed that she had filed the request to quash the arrest and would argue it at a future date.\n\nWashtenaw County assistant prosecutor Kati Rezmierski said she had just received the filing. The next hearing was set for Feb. 17.\n\nMoore arrived at the courthouse with his wife, Kelli and waited in an adjacent courtroom for his case to be called. He declined to comment but stood nearby when Michaels briefly spoke to reporters and said he's innocent.\n\nMoore coached the Wolverines for two seasons as the successor to Jim Harbaugh, who won a national championship before quitting to become coach of the NFL’s Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nKyle Whittingham, who coached Utah for two decades, is the new Michigan coach.",

    "fullText": "The Defense Department is rethinking what it means to serve your country, and it no longer necessarily involves a uniform.\n\nThrough a new initiative called the US Tech Force, the federal government is recruiting college students and Silicon Valley's brightest to spend two years modernizing government systems, working as engineers, data scientists, and technical leaders.\n\n\"We're hoping to get thousands of people out of college for a two-year stint — sort of make it, this is your service to the country as a technologist rather than as a soldier,\" Emil Michael, the undersecretary of defense for research and engineering and the agency's chief technology officer, said last week on the No Priors podcast, a tech show hosted by venture capitalists Sarah Guo and Elad Gil. Michael previously worked as Uber's chief business officer.\n\n\"We're going to try to make that a badge of honor,\" he added.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management, which is headed by former VC Scott Kupor, is coordinating the early-career program in partnership with other agencies, including the Department of Defense. Salaries will likely range from around $130,000 to $195,000, Kupor said in December.\n\nThe program, announced in December, joins a long history of initiatives by Silicon Valley technologists to pluck students out of classrooms and into boardrooms.

    "description": "A look at 20 free agents who have played for a defense with Parker as a coach, and how each performed in 2025.",
    "fullText": "One of the oldest tenets in the NFL is that players tend to follow the coaches who have had positive impacts on their development. With Christian Parker in line to become the next Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator, and with his glowing reputation as a teacher and tactician, it is fair to wonder which former players could be joining him in Dallas.\n\nFans know, the club is in dire need of additional defensive talent. And while Parker is moving up to playcaller for the first time in his career, his relationships with players doesn't necessarily have to be limited to secondary players just because he was the defensive passing game coordinator. There could absolutely be linebackers who have been involved in those meetings who are interested in working for the 34-year old under the bright lights in Dallas.\n\nThe first glimpse is to who are pending free agents within the Philadelphia Eagles organization but things don't stop there. Parker also coached with the Denver Broncos from 2021 through 2023, and players from that era could still easily be able to contribute in 2026.\n\nUnfortunately for the Cowboys, the players who likely have most benefitted from Parker's tutelage are either still under their rookie deals with the Eagles, or have signed on long-term with their team.\n\nPatrick Surtain II: First-team All-Pro\nQuinyon Mitchell: First-team All-Pro\nCooper DeJean: First-team All-Pro\n\n... and all before Christian Parker turns 35. \n\nwelcome to the #Cowboys, sir. https://t.co/vmUEdicnZM\n\n— Patrik [No C] Walker (@VoiceOfTheStar) January 22, 2026\n\nHere's a rundown of the top potential free agents who could now be in the mix in Dallas, tiered by their 2025 Pro Football Focus overall defensive grades.\n\nCB Ja'Quan McMillian (RFA), Denver, 2022-23, 80.3 grade in 2025\n\nMcMillian is a former UDFA who has been a staple in the Denver secondary. They will most likely slap him with a 1st round or 2nd round tender, taking him off the market.\n\nSafety Avonte Maddox, Detroit, 2024, 79.1 grade in 2025\n\nMaddox had an incredible single season in Detroit, but didn't fare as well in Philly. He had a 61.9 overall grade in his one season working with Parker.\n\nSafety CJ Gardner-Johnson, Philadelphia, 2024, 51.4 grade in 2025\n\nNot a great year for Gardner-Johnson in Chicago, but he did have a 77.0 grade w/ Parker in 2024.\n\nLB Justin Strnad, Denver, 2021-23, 72.1 grade in 2025\n\nStrnad barely played while Parker was in Denver, but that doesn't mean they didn't have a chance to form some level of working relationship. Now that he's getting, he's an intriguing option for the Cowboys to fill out their linebacker core with.\n\nCB Fabian Moreau, Minnesota, 2023, 71.4\n\nMoreau has a strong grade, but only played 198 snaps in 2025 as a reserve. Could definitely be added as a depth piece to help round out the roster if Parker liked what he saw their one year together in 2023; Moreau graded out at 62.4 on 739 snaps.\n\nLB Alex Singleton, Denver, 2022-23, 70.1\n\nSingle had a strong first year in Denver with Parker in 2022, his highest graded of his six seasons at 79.1.\n\nSafety PJ Locke, Denver, 2021-23, 63.0\n\nNothing much stands out with Locke, who has mostly been a reserve, but he did have 3 sacks on 11 pash rush snaps in 2023 with Parker.\n\nLB Nakobe Dean, Philadelphia, 2024-25, 62.2\n\nDean has generally been regarded as a bust with the Eagles, but when he got starter snaps through the year in 2024 with Parker, he had a 77.4 grade, including a strong year in both run defense and pass rush.\n\nThose aren't the only back-seven players who are on the free agent market this year, but they are the ones who turned in average-or-better performances. Here's a look at other free agent linebackers, cornerbacks and safeties with ties to Parker.\n\nCB Adoree' Jackson, Philadelphia, 2025, 53.6 grade in 2025\n\nSafety Marcus Epps, Philadelphia, 2025, 51.8 grade in 2025\n\nSafety Reed Blankenship, Philadelphia, 2024-25, 42.6 grade in 2025\n\nLB Ben Van Sumeren (RFA), Philadelphia, 2024-25, N/A\n\nLB Josey Jewell, Out of League, 2021-23\n\nSafety Justin Simmons, Out of League, 2021-23\n\nSafety Kareem Jackson, Out of the League, 2021-22\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cowboys Wire: Eagles, NFL free agents who may follow DC Christian Parker to Cowboys",

    "description": "Mykhailo Fedorov, the country's new defense minister, said his troops are already inflicting 35,000 battlefield kills a month. He wants more.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's new defense minister has set a new goal for its forces to kill 50,000 Russian troops a month, a sharp increase from the losses that Kyiv says it's inflicting on the Kremlin now.\n\nIn a meeting with reporters on Tuesday, Mykhailo Fedorov said the new figure would be a core \"strategic objective\" for Ukraine.\n\n\"The objective is to impose costs on Russia that it cannot bear. In this way to force peace through strength,\" Fedorov said.\n\nNotably, he specified only battlefield fatalities.\n\nThe new standard comes as Russia intensified its offensive in some areas of the front lines last year, aiming to take key cities such as Pokrovsk. The nature of its operations — often reliant on continuous high-casualty infantry attacks — has led to political discussion in recent months that the Kremlin may soon reach a point where it will lose more soldiers than it can recruit.\n\nUkraine's commander in chief, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said in December that his forces had, for the first time, killed and wounded more Russian soldiers in one month than the Kremlin had called up for the same time period.\n\nFedorov, who was confirmed in his role last week, said on Tuesday that Ukrainian troops are already documenting 35,000 kills every month via video.\n\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte cited another figure while speaking in Brussels on January 16, saying that 20,000 to 25,000 Russian troops were dying every month.\n\nWhile differing significantly, both figures indicate that Russia is fighting the war at a high cost.\n\nRutte said the death rate has become \"unsustainable\" for Russia, and drew comparisons to the Soviet Union's losses during the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan, when an estimated 15,000 Soviet troops died every month over nine years.\n\nLikewise, Fedorov expressed hopes that ramping up a focus on lethality will exhaust Russia's war machine.\n\n\"If we reach the figure of 50,000, we will see what happens to the enemy. They treat people as a resource, and problems with that resource are already obvious,\" he said.\n\nRussia does not disclose how many of its troops are wounded or killed during the war. However, international and Ukrainian analyses say the number is likely tracking past 1 million people over nearly four years of war.\n\nThe UK's defense ministry said in early January that the Kremlin may have suffered at least 1.2 million total casualties, which includes both wounded and deceased, since February 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kremlin has relied largely on hefty sign-up bonuses to attract local contract soldiers, though it's also been found to sustain troop levels through other means, such as by recruiting from prisons or hiring foreigners via informal channels.\n\nSome of those strategies may be waning. On Tuesday, the Russian independent media outlet Vertska reported that contract soldier sign-ups were slowing in some areas of the country.\n\nData from an unnamed source in the Moscow mayor's office, it wrote, showed that the capital had seen a roughly 25% annual drop in recruitment in 2025.\n\nIt's unclear how Fedorov intends to specifically target increasing combat kills. He said in his opening remarks to Ukrainian lawmakers last week that he intended to divert more staffing to drone units. Drones are thought to be responsible for roughly 70 to 90% of casualties inflicted during the war.\n\nHis new objective also comes against the backdrop of the US attempting to negotiate a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia. Many of the Kremlin's latest war actions, such as attempts to take Pokrovsk, have been seen in Ukraine as efforts to posture into a position of strength.\n\nAt 32, Fedorov is Ukraine's youngest-ever defense minister. He's begun his new appointment with promises of aggressive reform of the military's structure and how it distributes resources to its fighters.\n\nFedorov was previously Ukraine's minister for digital transformation.",

    "fullText": "BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — In two decades of kicking in doors for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Joseph Bongiovanni often took on the risks of being the “lead breacher,\" meaning he was the first person into the room.\n\nOn Wednesday, he felt a familiar uncertainty awaiting sentencing for using his DEA badge to protect childhood friends who became prolific drug traffickers in Buffalo, New York.\n\n“I never knew what was on the other side of that door — that fear is what I feel today,” Bongiovanni, 61, told a federal judge, pounding the defense table as his face reddened with emotion. “I've always been innocent. I loved that job.”\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Lawrence J. Vilardo sentenced the disgraced lawman to five years in federal prison on a string of corruption counts. The punishment was significantly less than the 15 years prosecutors sought even after a jury acquitted Bongiovanni of the most serious charges he faced, including an allegation he pocketed $250,000 in bribes from the Mafia.\n\nThe judge said the sentence reflected the complexity of the mixed verdicts following two lengthy trials and the almost Jekyll-and-Hyde nature of Bongiovanni's career, in which the lawman racked up enough front-page accolades to fill a trophy case.\n\nBongiovanni once hurtled into a burning apartment building to evacuate residents through billowing smoke. He locked up drug dealers, including the first ever prosecuted in the region for causing a fatal overdose.\n\n“There are two completely polar opposite versions of the facts and polar opposite versions of the defendant,” Vilardo said, assuring prosecutors five years behind bars would pose a considerable hardship to someone who has never been to prison.\n\nDefense attorney Parker MacKay noted the judge had acknowledged Bongiovanni as a “beacon” of the Buffalo community. The government's request for a 15-year sentence, he added, was “completely unmoored to the nature of the convictions.”\n\n“As Mr. Bongiovanni told the judge at sentencing, he is innocent, and we look forward to continuing to work with him to prove that,” MacKay told The Associated Press.\n\nA jury in 2024 convicted Bongiovanni of four counts of obstruction of justice, counts of conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and making false statements to law enforcement.\n\nProsecutors said Bongiovanni's “little dark secret” caused immeasurable damage over 11 years. They likened him to Jose Irizarry, a disgraced former DEA agent serving a 12-year federal sentence after confessing to laundering money for Colombian drug cartels.\n\nBongiovanni upheld an oath not to the DEA, they argued, but to organized crime figures in the tight-knit Italian American community of his North Buffalo upbringing. During sentencing, Bongiovanni’s family dissolved into tears on the front row of the packed courtroom in downtown Buffalo.\n\nProsecutors said Bongiovanni's corruption involved as much inaction as calculated coverup. They pointed to a turning point in 2008 when Bongiovanni could have acted on intelligence about traffickers he knew whose operation would evolve into a large-scale organization with links to California, Vancouver, and New York City.\n\nHe also was accused of authoring bogus DEA reports, stealing sensitive files, throwing off colleagues, outing confidential informants, covering for a sex-trafficking strip club and helping a high school English teacher keep his marijuana-growing side hustle. Prosecutors said he brazenly urged colleagues to spend less time investigating Italians and focus instead on Black and Hispanic people.\n\n“His conduct shook the foundation of law enforcement — and this community — to its core,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Tripi told the judge. “That's what a betrayal is.”\n\nThe ex-agent's downfall came amid a sex-trafficking prosecution that took sensational turns, including an implicated judge who killed himself after the FBI raided his home, law enforcement dragging a pond in search of an overdose victim and dead rats planted outside the home of a government witness who prosecutors allege was later killed by a fatal dose of fentanyl.\n\nIt also involved the Pharoah’s Gentlemen’s Club outside Buffalo. Bongiovanni was childhood friends with the strip club’s owner, Peter Gerace Jr., who authorities say has close ties to both the Buffalo Mafia and the violent Outlaws Motorcycle Club. A separate jury convicted Gerace of a sex trafficking conspiracy and of paying bribes to Bongiovanni.\n\nThe prosecution also cast a harsh light on the DEA after a string of corruption scandals prompted at least 17 agents brought up on federal charges over the past decade. Last month, prosecutors charged another former agent with conspiring to launder millions of dollars and obtain military-grade firearms and explosives for a Mexican drug cartel.\n\nFrank Tarentino, the DEA’s northeast associate chief of operations, said Bongiovanni’s sentence “sends a powerful message that those who betray their badge will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.”",

    "title": "Ukraine's elite Alpha unit dealt a $4 billion blow to Russian air defenses last year, security forces say",
    "description": "The Security Service of Ukraine said its \"Alpha\" special forces hit Russian air defense and radar systems with long-range strikes.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's elite \"Alpha\" unit destroyed or disabled Russian air defense systems that were worth a total of around $4 billion over the past year, the country's security service said.\n\nThe Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said on Monday that its \"Alpha\" special forces unit conducted long-range strikes on Russian air defense and radar systems. The unit heavily relies on long-range drones in its attacks.\n\nIt said the strikes managed to break open corridors in Russia's multilayered air defenses and created safe passages to allow Ukraine's long-range drones to punch deep behind enemy lines.\n\nThose deep-strike assets struck targets like military bases, warehouses, and airfields, the SBU said. Ukraine has reported a slew of such strikes, which are key in preventing a big Russian force buildup and hindering operations.\n\nThe SBU listed off the types of air defense systems it said Alpha attacks destroyed or damaged: S-300s and S-400s, BUK M-1s and M-2s, Pantsir S-1s and S-2s, and Tor-M1s, M2s, and M3s. These systems range from older, Soviet-era models to some of Russia's most advanced systems.\n\nMany of these systems come with large price tags, though the cost of the losses is often the estimated current cost of replacement. Russia's defense industrial base faces strains from sanctions and other pressures.\n\nThe Ukrainian security service said the Russians also suffered losses of radar reconnaissance and guidance equipment, including radar stations and radars. Examples listed by the SBU included the Nebo-U radar and the Gamma-D.\n\nThe Alpha group is an elite unit that is considered among the best of Ukraine's special forces. It frequently carries out long-range drone attacks on Russian targets, including on aircraft, ammunition depots, and oil operations in Russia.\n\nIn November, the SBU said that its \"Alpha\" special forces had killed more than 1,500 Russian soldiers and destroyed dozens of tanks, armored combat vehicles, multiple rocket launchers, and air defense systems over the previous month.\n\nAir defense systems have been an integral part of this conflict, fundamentally shaping how it has been fought. Russia and Ukraine, at the start of the full-scale war in February 2022, possessed the largest and second-largest air defense arsenals in Europe, respectively, and their proliferation has heavily restricted front-line air operations. Neither side has been able to secure permanent control of the skies.\n\nA lack of air cover hamstrung large-scale breakthrough efforts, blunting the effectiveness of weaponry like tanks and contributing to the war's transformation into a slow, grinding fight, one where drones dominate and further prevent maneuver.\n\nUkraine has reported the destruction of a slew of Russian air defense weapons throughout the war, including advanced S-400s and a host of defenses on the strategic Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed illegally in 2014. Crippling these has been a priority.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has raised alarms in much of Europe and NATO about the lack of ground-based air defenses. Investment in them slowed after the Cold War. The alliance has pledged a huge investment in them, but it's the kind of ramp-up that takes time. Western manufacturers already have big backlogs amid the increased demand.\n\nAir defense is vital for combating not just crewed and uncrewed aircraft, but also missiles, and there is a substantial global demand for proven capabilities. US defense giant Lockheed Martin recently announced a deal with the Pentagon to dramatically boost production of Patriot interceptors.\n\nUkraine has received air defense systems from partner nations over the course of the war, from advanced US-made Patriots to improvised \"FrankenSAMs\" that mix Soviet launchers with Western missiles. Ukraine is building its own air defense systems to reduce dependency on partners.\n\nUkraine says it needs more air defenses and far more interceptors. Russia regularly hammers the country with massive missile and drone barrages targeting both military and civilian infrastructure.\n\nThough Ukraine appears to be inflicting damage, Russia's air defense arsenal is still a threat.\n\nJustin Bronk, an airpower expert at the Royal United Services Institute, warned in a report this month that despite Russia's ground-based integrated air defence systems suffering attrition from Ukraine, Russia still has several hundred batteries of different surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems in service.\n\nFurthermore, he said, they have also become \"significantly more effective\" at shooting down Ukrainian air assets as Russia learns throughout the war.\n\nAnd beyond Ukraine, he warned that Russia's ground-based air defenses remain \"a highly potent threat to NATO air capabilities in a European context.\"",

    "description": "It was an ugly, brutal playoff win, but the Rams found a way. A defense that refused to break. From a team who cut their kicker, then called one to save their season.",
    "fullText": "CHICAGO — He emerged from the tunnel into a swirling, frozen gloom, with the whisper of an NFC Championship game wrapped in a wool hat.\n\nThe score was tied 10-10. His offense, listless. The grip on the season was as numb as the wet fingers frozen from heavy snow.\n\nSean McVay looked at his players, their breath clouding the frigid air, and delivered a three-word sermon that would become a prophecy, a plea, and a lifeline.\n\nWhat followed was 90 minutes of playoff football distilled to its raw, brutal essence. The Los Angeles Rams' 20-17 overtime victory over the Chicago Bears is a continued quest for redemption after their season ended a year ago in the Divisional Round.\n\nIn a contest where the Los Angeles Rams' most maligned units became their saviors, where their brilliant quarterback battled his own form, and where their meticulous coach nearly cost them everything.\n\nWhen the final, arcing kick from Harrison \"The Thiccer Kicker\" Mevis sliced through the gray haze and between the uprights, it was more than a game-winner.\n\nAll year, the Rams' special teams had been in disarray, a festering wound.\n\nKicks were blocked. Field goals sailed wide.\n\nThey fired their coordinator. They released a long snapper. They cut our kicker.\n\nThe move to Mevis was a desperate Hail Mary.\n\nAnd in this frozen hell, their kicker became a Godsend.\n\nHis 42-yard winner was an act of supreme pressure, a redemption arc written in ice.\n\n\"I felt really confident,\" McVay said. \"The weather had calmed down… I was very confident he would make that.\"\n\nThe operation—snap, hold, kick—was flawless in conditions designed for failure.\n\nIf special teams provided the final punctuation, the Rams' secondary authored the game's most defiant stanzas.\n\nA perceived weakness became an unyielding fortress.\n\nCobie Durant set the tone early, picking off Caleb Williams on the goal line. Kam Curl was a force, a sure-tackling missile whose night crescendoed with the play of the season: a leaping, game-sealing interception of Williams in overtime.\n\nIn a mix of awe and absolution, McVay exhaled, \"What a freaking play by Cam Curl,\" McVay said.\n\nThey played with a collective amnesia for their reputation, attacking the ball, confusing a young quarterback, and proving that heart can be a scheme.\n\n\"Our defense was outstanding,\" McVay said. \"They carried us tonight.\"\n\nThey had to because the offense and its architect stumbled.\n\nMatthew Stafford, the likely MVP, 1-9 in cold, rainy and frigid games since joining the Rams, fought the elements and a vicious Bears defense to a 20-of-42, 258-yard stalemate.\n\nHe was sacked four times. His rhythm, absent. Yet, when absolute clarity was demanded, he was crystalline. He found Puka Nacua, who was limited to 5 catches and 56 yards, for a critical third-down conversion in OT.\n\nHe dropped a dime to Davante Adams on the sideline—a throw Adams called \"a pinky-to-pinky catch\"—that required video review to believe.\n\n\"I tried to put it to a spot… he's as long as it gets at corner,\" Stafford said. \"What a hell of a catch.\"\n\nBut Stafford's path was nearly blocked by his own coach.\n\nWith a chance to ice the game late in the fourth, leading 17-10, McVay faced a critical third-and-1. Opposed to throwing for the first, McVay played it safe and opted to run the ball with Kyren Williams.\n\nThe play was stuffed. The ensuing Ethan Evans punt was shanked.\n\nBears quarterback Caleb Williams then authored his own miracle, a 51-yard heave to Cole Kmet for a touchdown with 18 seconds left.\n\nMcVay didn't hide from the error.\n\n\"I make a terrible third down and one call. No excuse for that. Should have used the timeout… I can be better for our group. I will be better,\" McVay said.\n\nHis honesty was as stark as the Chicago cold.\n\nYet, the Rams found a way. They always do.\n\nStafford, the grizzled gunslinger, is now one game away from contending for his second Super Bowl.\n\nThe only thing standing in his way—the Seattle Seahawks. A division rival. A house of horrors. The site of a brutal collapse just a month ago.\n\n\"It's a huge challenge to go play in Seattle,\" Stafford said. \"We've done it once this year, and what a hell of a game that was… I'm sure excited to be in this opportunity.\"\n\nIn the visitor's locker room, soaked in sweat and satisfaction, McVay's halftime command echoed.\n\nHis team found a way not by being perfect, but by being persistent.\n\nNot with an award-winning performance, but with a defiant, collective scream into the blizzard.\n\nThe special teams are reborn. The secondary, redeemed. The quarterback, resilient. The kicker, clutch.\n\nThey survived themselves. They survived the cold. They survived chaos.\n\nNow, they head north, with one more mountain to climb, the echoes of a simple command now their battle cry: Find a way.",

    "description": "North Carolina’s defense is unraveling, losses are piling up and Hubert Davis is under increasing scrutiny as ACC play nears.",
    "fullText": "North Carolina’s season is unraveling before the heart of ACC play even arrives, and Hubert Davis is suddenly facing the most scrutiny of his tenure in Chapel Hill.\n\nAlthough North Carolina is 14-4 on the season, which isn’t terrible, the Tar Heels have lost three of their last four games, including an 84-78 loss to Cal that saw the Bears shoot 50% from the field (29-for-58) and a blistering 62.5% from 3-point range (10-for-16). It marked the fourth straight game the Tar Heels have surrendered at least 40% from beyond the arc. Since the start of ACC play, opponents have hit 72 3-pointers against UNC, an average of 14.4 per game.\n\nThe Tar Heels’ terrible defensive play isn’t going to get any better soon, especially with North Carolina yet to reach the heart of ACC play. And given the expectations placed on Carolina going into the season, it could be Hubert Davis’ last season as head coach.\n\nThat’s what many Carolina fans are saying and thinking, and it’s not unreasonable to do so given the amount of expectations on the Tar Heels entering the season — or every season.\n\nHowever, Davis’ seat isn’t hot, but it’s definitely past 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nFor starters, Carolina spent $14 million for this season’s roster that includes Luka Bogavac, Kyan Evans, Henri Veesaar and, of course, Carolina’s freshman phenom Caleb Wilson.\n\nWhile Veesaar and Wilson are arguably the ACC’s best backcourt duo, Bogavac and Evans aren’t in the starting lineup anymore because of their struggles of late.\n\nAnd the Tar Heels’ lackluster defense, which has already cost them games — and potentially many more — is giving Davis’ detractors more reasons to say he shouldn’t be the head man in Chapel Hill.\n\nThe larger issue is the pattern. Davis’ first team stumbled through much of 2021-22 before catching fire, upsetting Duke in Coach K’s final home game and riding a Cinderella run to the national title game. A year later, North Carolina opened as the preseason No. 1 and ended as the first team in that spot to miss the NCAA Tournament since the field expanded in 1985.\n\nIn 2023-24, the Tar Heels regrouped, starting at No. 19, winning the ACC regular-season title and reaching the Sweet 16. Last season, they began at No. 9, faded to unranked and barely reached the NCAA field through the First Four in Dayton.\n\nIt’s a résumé defined by wild swings — something Duke under Jon Scheyer and Virginia under Ryan Odom haven’t shared — and Carolina appears stuck, if not slipping backward.\n\nThe lack of consistency is not what Tar Heels fans want. It’s never easy to replace a legend like Roy Williams, especially for a first-time head coach like Davis.\n\nHowever, Duke’s transition from Mike Krzyzewski to Jon Scheyer has been like nothing changed. Scheyer led the Blue Devils to the Final Four last season, and every year the Blue Devils have gotten better.\n\nVirginia has also bounced back extremely quickly under Ryan Odom, and it looks like the Cavaliers are the second-best team in the conference after Duke.\n\nCarolina is not moving forward. It’s either staying in the same place or going backward.\n\nIt’s pretty simple why he’s not on the hot seat just yet: The Tar Heels are 14-4, and there are still plenty of games left.\n\nCollege basketball is a weird sport, and we have seen teams play subpar basketball and take it up a notch as the season goes along.\n\nTwo great examples of this are North Carolina’s 1997 Final Four and 2022 Final Four squads.\n\nThe 1997 squad, one that had Vince Carter and Antawn Jamison, started off the season 12-6 before going on a 16-game winning streak and advancing to the Final Four as a No. 1 seed. That team also won four straight games against ranked opponents to close out the regular season, which included wins over Tim Duncan-led No. 4 Wake Forest and No. 7 Duke.\n\nThe 2022 team spent most of the season unranked and even lost to an 11-21 Pitt team, giving the Tar Heels an 18-8 record. However, UNC followed the loss to Pitt with a five-game winning streak to end the regular season, including its shocking win over Duke in Coach K’s final home game in Cameron Indoor Stadium. That kick-started its Cinderella run to the national championship that season.\n\nWhile Davis’ coaching ability is being questioned right now, the Tar Heels have a lot of time to fix issues that are largely fixable. And while his tenure has been inconsistent, a lot of programs around the country would kill for Davis’ first four years at the helm.\n\nHowever, time is beginning to run out, and tension is starting to arise in the Southern Part of Heaven.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: UNC Basketball: Is Hubert Davis on the hot seat?",

    "description": "Seattle's level of domination has set the bar incredibly high for whoever wins the frozen showdown between the Chicago Bears and Los Angeles Rams.",
    "fullText": "Seattle laid its claim for the NFL throne in the exact way it did during its dominant run toward the NFC’s No. 1 seed: by ferociously pummeling their opponent without mercy.\n\nThe Seahawks’ offense had a productive, albeit somewhat ugly game Saturday night against the San Francisco 49ers, but Seattle’s defense (and special teams!) stole the show in this 41-6 divisional round wipeout. Now Seattle is a game away from getting back to the Super Bowl for the first time in over a decade.\n\nIt’s a playoff position star defender DeMarcus Lawrence, who had a strip sack of Brock Purdy late in the second half, hasn’t seen in his career after spending 11 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys. His prophetic words from last March about leaving Dallas for Seattle in free agency made a comeback on social media after the Seahawks’ emphatic win. And they’re bound to have some staying power this coming week as the Seahawks prepare for the NFC title game. But what else stuck out for Lawrence that symbolized this tenacious defense was the new necklace he sported postgame with the initials: MOB.\n\nNew “MOB” necklace for DeMarcus Lawrence looks like it wasn’t free pic.twitter.com/sYP7WASZPE\n\n— Mike Sando (@SandoNFL) January 18, 2026\n\n“Yeah, brand new MOB necklace, man,” Lawrence said. “You know, just letting the world know how we coming, you know.”\n\nIn a league where offenses and quarterbacks are the stars of the show, Seattle has built a defense that’s just as compelling as the biggest, flashiest arms in the NFL and they showed that they’re absolutely good enough to ride to a title.\n\nSeattle didn't even let the 49ers get into the game, doing the same thing it did during the Week 18 regular-season finale when it stifled the 49ers’ running game, which subsequently forced Brock Purdy to be a dropback passer and throw into the teeth of an immovable defense. This weekend, the Seahawks held the 49ers to 28 yards on 11 designed runs in the first half, and again forced the 49ers to play a style of football they don’t want to play.\n\nThe Seahawks forced their second turnover on downs of the night to open the third quarter, the offense rewarded the defense with a field goal and the 21-point deficit was too much against Seattle’s marauding defense.\n\nThis is the kind of performance that No. 1 seeds should have against weaker opponents in their conference. Not that the 49ers are a bad team, they’re just an absurdly injured one. But this level of domination has set the bar incredibly high for whoever wins the frozen showdown between the Chicago Bears and Los Angeles Rams. In a season when head coach Kyle Shanahan had all the answers as the 49ers’ lineups shifted and became more depleted, the Seahawks were all over everything he tried to throw out. Not only are they talented, they’re incredibly well-orchestrated with second-year head coach Mike Macdonald pulling all the strings on defense.\n\nThe 49ers didn’t even reach the red zone in this game and this was an offense that ranked top-three in most standard and advanced metrics over the back half of the season. It’s not like the Seahawks have been padding their stats against the worst teams that the league has to offer. This status is earned through trial. The only offense to put up over 20 points on Seattle over the final nine weeks of the season has been the Rams (the Titans scored 24 but they had a 90-yard punt return touchdown). They’ve given up 75 points since Week 13 with 37 of those points, legitimately half, coming against the Rams.\n\nTeams need to be as dialed in, talented and well-coached as the Rams to really score against this defense. The run the Seahawks are on will go down in the record books as an all-time finish if they can maintain this level of defensive dominance against one of two of the better offenses in the NFL. In the Rams’ case, they’re probably just the flat-out best offense period this season.\n\nThat creates a potentially fascinating third matchup between the Seahawks and their division rival Rams, but L.A. still has to get there first. Caleb Williams and the Bears are no pushover at this point, but when Seattle stuffs Shanahan and the 49ers in a locker for the second time in three weeks, it's hard not to feel like this is the current favorite for the Super Bowl. Seattle’s defense is really that good and it has one of the elite special teams units in the entire league, as shown by Rashid Shaheed’s 95-yard opening kickoff return for a touchdown.\n\nThe health of the Bears or Rams will likely create a tougher test than what the 49ers were able to muster, but this defense is playing as well as a unit possibly can in the modern NFL and the Seahawks seem to be getting better each week. No matter who shows up to face the Seahawks next Sunday, the only thing louder than Lumen Field will be the boom this defense brings seemingly every single play.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — From toppling Venezuela's leader to ordering mass deportations, from turning once independent government entities into rubber stamps to demolishing the East Wing for a White House ballroom, President Donald Trump spent his first year back in office trampling political norms and testing institutional checks and balances.\n\nSome of his ideas that once seemed implausible, if not outright fanciful, are now reality. But there are other things that Trump could not deliver on.\n\n“I’ve kept all my promises and much more,” Trump insisted during a speech this week in Detroit.\n\nWith his administration nearing the one-year mark, here's a look at where some of his most jaw-dropping promises stand:\n\nIn progress: A new Qatari Air Force One\n\nU.S. defense officials in May accepted a luxury Boeing 747 jet from Qatar for Trump to eventually use as Air Force One, brushing aside ethical and legal questions and even anti-bribery constitutional provisions. The aircraft is being retrofitted in Texas to meet U.S. security and communications standards that are likely to cost about $400 million, the Air Force says. Outside experts estimate costs could approach $1 billion. Despite Trump's boasts that the work would be done in six months, completion may not actually occur until after he leaves office in January 2029.\n\nWhat's in progress: Annexing Greenland\n\nAfter the U.S. military's removal of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, Trump renewed his calls to take over the semiautonomous Danish territory, insisting the United States will “have” Greenland “one way or another.” The president also tapped Gov. Jeff Landry, R-La., as the special U.S. envoy to Greenland, with a nod to the 1803 Louisiana Purchase from France that doubled the size of the U.S. Denmark says it is not ceding the world's largest island and that any invasion could have geopolitical implications given that Denmark is a NATO ally.\n\nTrump has tried to denigrate his predecessor, Joe Biden, by accusing the Democrat of overreliance on the autopen to sign presidential pardons, legislation and other key documents, despite the fact that Trump and other presidents have also used the tool. In October, a GOP-controlled House committee released a report alleging misuse of the autopen by the Biden administration. Trump's Department of Justice is investigating.\n\nThe president has said he wants to reopen an “expanded and rebuilt” Alcatraz, the notorious San Francisco Bay prison that has been closed for six-plus decades, to house immigration detainees. William K. Marshall III, the director of the Bureau of Prisons, toured the island in July. His agency announced that engineers and planners were developing design concepts, preliminary budgets and logistical models.\n\nTrump has posted on social media about extending traditional home mortgages repayments from 30 years to 50 years, suggesting that this could ease concerns about housing affordability. Economists say the switch would make it harder to build wealth through home ownership. Nonetheless, the White House has pledged to push the change. Officials have made little headway since, however, and Trump instead has looked to reduce mortgage rates by having the federal government buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds.\n\nTrump has frequently toyed with the idea of a third term, despite the Constitution stating that no one can be elected president “more than twice.” He acknowledged in October, “I would say that if you read it, it’s pretty clear I’m not allowed to run. It’s too bad.” White House chief of staff Susie Wiles also told Vanity Fair that Trump “knows he can’t run again.” Still, Trump mused this month, “I’m not allowed to run? I’m not sure,” and suggested there could be “a constitutional movement” to make that happen.\n\nWhat's faded away: Making Canada the 51st state\n\nDespite it being far-fetched, Trump has talked about making America's northern neighbor the “Great State of Canada” since before his second term started. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney assured Trump during a subsequent White House visit that his country “won’t be for sale, ever.” Carney suggested in June that Trump had lost interest. Trump has continued to bring up the idea, though, including during a September speech to military personnel in Virginia.\n\nTrump suggested in February that billionaire Elon Musk would be checking out Fort Knox in Kentucky to ensure that U.S. gold reserves were still there. The president even floated the notion of tagging along. Nothing came of that, however, and Musk has left the administration.\n\nSending thousands of migrants to Guantanamo\n\nThe president pledged to ship up to 30,000 of the “worst criminal aliens” to a U.S. Navy lockup in Cuba, and between February and June, about 500 immigrants were held there. But those numbers have since declined and sometimes reached zero. Housing migrants at Guantanamo is more expensive than in traditional detention centers, and doing so has drawn legal challenges.\n\nGaza Strip as a Mediterranean Sea resort\n\nTrump repeatedly suggested that the U.S. would take over war-torn Gaza and move out the Palestinians living there, and that U.S. developers could turn the area into a “Riviera of the Middle East,” after the war between Israel and Hamas. Gaza's reconstruction is a key question amid a Trump administration-brokered ceasefire, but Arab nations have rejected the idea of it being a vacation spot. Trump no longer mentions it.\n\nThe president says his tariffs could raise enough revenue for most Americans to get $2,000 payments. But he also has pledged to spend that same money on plugging deficits created by tax cuts, reducing the national debt, keeping a key nutrition program for low-income mothers and children funded during last year's government shutdown, aiding farmers and adding to defense spending for 2027. The U.S. collected about $289 billion in tariff revenue last year, which would be well short of what rebate checks would cost, even without the other promised earmarks. Trump also promised that slashing the size of federal government would give Americans rebate checks, but those never materialized.\n\nEliminating the federal income tax\n\nTrump has frequently said that steep import tariffs “will be enough to cut all of the income tax,” long suggesting that the U.S. was better off during the Gilded Age, when there was no income tax and federal revenue came largely from tariffs. “If you go back to the 1800s, 1887,” he said Friday, “We had money, so much money, we didn’t know what to do with it.” Lately, however, his administration has more often been promoting how much his tax and spending law might reduce 2026 tax bills for many Americans.\n\nTrump hates the dynamic kickoff, calling it a “demeaning” and “unromantic” affront to football's “pageantry.” By November, Trump was suggesting the NFL didn't “have the right to do that to the game” while acknowledging, “I don’t think they’ll change.”\n\nWhat's been accomplished: Bringing back the War Department\n\nTrump signed an executive order in September aiming to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War. It will take an act of Congress to make the change lawful.\n\nThe board of trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, stocked with Trump loyalists, voted in December to add Trump's name to Washington's premier performing arts venue, memorializing the 35th president. The move drew show cancellations and a lawsuit. The Kennedy Center is named by statute and would need Congress' approval for a legal change.\n\nReducing Chinese influence on the Panama Canal\n\nTrump suggested before his second term that the U.S. might retake control of the Panama Canal because Panama had failed to check Chinese influence over the waterway. His administration then pressured China to have the Hong Kong-based operator of ports at both ends of the canal sell those interests to a U.S. consortium, though that process faced delays. Panama withdrew from China's Belt and Road investment program in Latin America, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited Panama in April and agreed to bolster security coordination.\n\nThe president announced in December that his long-promised “ gold card ” was going on sale. It offers legal status, and an eventual pathway to U.S. citizenship, for individuals paying $1 million and corporations ponying up twice that per foreign-born employee, plus an upfront $15,000 fee to cover screening costs. The program is meant to replace EB-5 visas, which offered permanent U.S. residency in exchange for foreign investors spending a bit more than $1 million on a business that creates at least 10 full-time jobs for American workers.\n\nSince tearing down the East Wing, construction crews have worked into the night, hustling to finish the massive ballroom before Trump's term ends. The president initially said the structure, set to be bigger than the White House itself, would cost $200 million but he now says $400 million. He has promised that it will be paid for by himself and private donors. The White House has released only a partial list of who is actually contributing and has argued that parts of the project's plans are “ top secret.”\n\nMore to watch: Possible US military action in Colombia, Mexico and Iran\n\nFollowing the U.S. operation in Venezuela, Trump accused Colombian President Gustavo Petro of “making cocaine and selling it to the United States” and said U.S intervention in that country “sounds good to me.” After a friendly call with Petro, however, Trump suggested that “the situation of drugs and other disagreements” had been defused. Trump, though, also maintains that Mexico is “run” by drug cartels and says, “You have to do something with Mexico.” He's warned Iran that if that country starts “killing people like they have in the past” during a recent round of sweeping, anti-government protests, then “they are going to get hit very hard by the United States.” Killings have run into the thousands, but by Friday, Trump appeared to be backing off those threats.\n\nCuba collapsing with or without US intervention\n\nTrump has repeatedly noted Cuba's weakened position since the U.S. captured Maduro, whose country was a major ally of the communist-run island. Trump has said Cuba “only survives because of Venezuela” and is “ready to fall” without the U.S. intervening. Venezuela's economic and social chaos and Maduro's ouster have raised questions about Cuba's future. But Trump has also suggested Cuba “make a deal, BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE,” without saying what that means.\n\nTrump says he wants a Golden Dome missile defense program — a multilayered, $175 billion system that would put U.S. weapons in space for the first time — to be fully operational by January 2029. Defense officials say more likely all that will be achieved by then is some initial capability for the system. It is envisioned to include ground- and space-based capabilities that can detect and stop missiles at various stages of attack.\n\nTrump said he talked to Rob Manfred before Major League Baseball's commissioner reinstated Cincinnati Reds slugger Pete Rose in May. Rose died in 2024 but still faced a baseball ban over betting on the game, despite having a record 4,256 career hits. Trump now wants Rose in the Hall of Fame, but that's up to the Hall’s Classic Baseball Committee, which likely will not meet until at least December 2027.\n\nThe fourth installment of the cop buddy-comedy series starring Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan will be coming out after a reported request from Trump. Paramount, which is co-owned by David Ellison, son of Oracle co-founder and Trump megadonor Larry Ellison, is set to distribute the film. Semafor reported that Trump had asked Ellison to help revive the franchise. Warner Bros. released the first three “Rush Hour” films, but eschewed the fourth after earlier sexual misconduct allegations against its director, Brett Ratner. Ratner also made a documentary on first lady Melania Trump.",

    "description": "The game got away from the Packers defense in the second half because they couldn’t figure out a way to stop Bears rookie tight end Colston Loveland.",
    "fullText": "GREEN BAY – Each week during the NFL season, PackersNews reporter Pete Dougherty and Eric Baranczyk break down game film from the Green Bay Packers game, looking for significant developments.\n\nThe following is an excerpt from this week’s story. For the full story, click here.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers’ defense had a winning performance in keeping the Chicago Bears’ running game in check during their 31-27 wild-card playoff loss Jan. 10.\n\nChicago came into this game ranked No. 3 in the NFL in rushing yards per game and per carry but gained only 93 yards rushing and a measly 3.3-yard average in this game.\n\nBut the game got away from defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley in the second half because he couldn’t figure out a way to stop rookie tight end Colston Loveland.\n\nLoveland had only one catch in the first half but finished with eight receptions for 137 yards and a touchdown for the game. He kept getting open behind the Packers’ linebackers, who took relatively shallow drops even as Loveland started becoming a primary target.\n\nHafley presumably wanted to keep his linebackers closer to the line of scrimmage in case Caleb Williams escaped the pocket, which is when he’s most dangerous. Hafley also didn’t call a blitz-heavy game (12 total) to put pressure on Williams, which is a sign he didn’t think cornerbacks Keisean Nixon and Carrington Valentine would hold up with less help in coverage.\n\nThe other alternative would have been to mug up a linebacker on Loveland at the line of scrimmage to disrupt his routes, but Hafley did not try that either.\n\nThe alternatives aren’t great against Williams because he is so dangerous when he’s on the move. The Packers did a decent job keeping him in the pocket much of the night, and he was his usual hit-and-miss self from the pocket. He completed only half (24) of his 48 passes on the night.\n\nBut the Bears have a quality receiving corps with Rome Odunze, DJ Moore and rookie Luther Burden III, which also demands attention. Then when Loveland started gashing the Packers, Hafley had no answer.\n\nIt was surprising the Packers didn’t give Trevon Diggs some snaps to see if he could make a game-turning interception.\n\nThey claimed Diggs on waivers two weeks ago, and after playing him a half against Minnesota, it looked like they might have seen enough to rotate him or even start him at cornerback against the Bears. But raising that possibility during press conferences last week was apparently a ruse to force the Bears to waste some time preparing for him.\n\nDiggs has only two interceptions since an ACL injury in 2023, and by all accounts has not been the player he was. But he was a ballhawk who had 18 interceptions in 47 games before that. He played only one snap against the Bears.\n\nDiggs is under contract for next season, but there is zero chance the Packers will bring him back at $15.5 million in bonuses and salary. They might have brought him on just as insurance at the cornerback position in case they made a deep playoff run, though there’s also the chance they saw enough to like in practice the last two weeks to try to bring him back with a big pay cut.\n\nJonathan Ford didn’t do much to distinguish in his first game back with the Packers, at Minnesota in the regular-season finale. But he played much better in helping them hold running backs De’Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai to 81 yards rushing and a 3.9-yard average per carry.\n\nFord, who played 18 snaps, had issues getting knocked off the line of scrimmage against the Vikings despite his 338-pound frame. But he held the point of attack much better against the Bears.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers News: Packers defense gets burned by Bears rookie tight end | Film review",

    "title": "The US expected 'significant resistance' from Venezuela's air defenses, Maduro raid planning memo reveals",
    "description": "Venezuela relied on Russian air defense systems and Chinese radars, but its forces did not shoot down any US military aircraft.",
    "fullText": "The US expected \"significant resistance\" from Venezuela's air defense systems during the nighttime raid to capture the country's former president, Nicolás Maduro, a newly released memo reveals.\n\nThe heavily redacted memorandum from the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel sheds new light on the Trump administration's planning efforts ahead of the early January military operation, including what opposition US forces might face from Venezuela's military and what that meant for the helicopters carrying special operators into downtown Caracas to grab Maduro and his wife.\n\n\"It is expected that US forces will face significant resistance on the approach,\" T. Elliot Gaiser, an assistant attorney general, wrote in the December 23 memo that was made public this week. \"There are as many as 75 anti-aircraft battery sites along the approach route to Fort Tiuna,\" Gaiser cited planning information provided by the Department of Defense.\n\nFort Tiuna, or Fuerte Tiuna, is a major military installation in the capital city, Caracas, that hosts defense ministries, critical commands, official residences, and other strategic infrastructure, and it is where Maduro was believed to be during the raid. The US heavily bombed the base, with satellite imagery showing widespread destruction at the site in the aftermath.\n\nThe DOJ memo also noted that Maduro's wife, Cilia Flores, would likely be present at the base. It said that she is \"known to be more aggressive and combative\" than her husband.\n\nMore than 150 US warplanes participated in the American operation, named Operation Absolute Resolve, including fighter jets, bombers, and drones. Some of these aircraft carried out strikes against Venezuelan military targets, including surface-to-air missile systems, to clear a path for low-flying helicopters carrying the forces that apprehended Maduro and his wife.\n\nThe DOJ memo hinted at additional threats and noted that Venezuela possessed unspecified, due to the heavy redactions, \"weapons\" that \"are capable of downing the helicopters carrying\" the assault forces. It's possible this is a reference to the Russian Igla man-portable air defense systems, shoulder-launched missiles designed to hit low-altitude targets, but it's unclear.\n\nMaduro said prior to the raid that Venezuela possessed thousands of Igla launchers.\n\nVenezuela relied heavily on Russian-made systems for its air defense network — such as S-300 batteries, Buk systems, and S-125 Pechora launchers — and Chinese radars. These weapon systems are believed to have been older export variants, though still capable; however, reporting indicates that systems might have been offline or in storage at the time of the attack.\n\nThough there had long been questions about the readiness of Venezuela's air defense network, Pentagon planners still considered it necessary to neutralize it. \"Before the assault force arrives at Fort Tiuna,\" the memo said, aircraft \"will serve as an escort and clear emplaced anti-aircraft batteries as needed.\"\n\n\"Risks to the mission are significant. Success will depend on surprise,\" the DOJ memo, which reviews the legality of the US raid, warned at the time.\n\nVenezuela's air defenses did not shoot down any US military aircraft during the raid; Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said shortly after the mission ended that the systems had been quickly dismantled by American forces.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth later said it \"seems those Russian air defenses didn't quite work so well, did they?\"\n\nThe newly released DOJ memo, which details how the US could present this as a law enforcement operation rather than an act of war, wrote that \"in addition to the targets for pre-assault fire,\" the Department of Defense \"has identified three airfields that may be destroyed should it appear that fighters are being assembled there to intercept the assault force.\"\n\n\"The airfields will not be struck otherwise as they are dual use for military and civilian purposes,\" the memo adds. It was written more than a week before the raid, so it's unclear whether US planning may have been tweaked in the days leading up to the mission.\n\nSatellite imagery revealed damage at the Higuerote Airport on Venezuela's northern coast, dozens of miles east of Caracas, after the raid. Photos from the tarmac showed a destroyed air defense system and a wrecked light aircraft.\n\nAlthough the US didn't appear to have faced the substantial resistance it expected, it still faced some during the raid. American forces stormed Maduro's compound under heavy fire, and at some point, a helicopter took a hit, reportedly by gunfire, but it remained flyable.\n\nA defense official said that seven US service members were wounded in the raid. \"The fact that this extremely complex and grueling mission was successfully executed with so few injuries is a testament to the expertise of our joint warriors,\" they added.\n\nVenezuela and Cuba said dozens of their security personnel were killed during the raid.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Kiki Rice celebrated her 22nd birthday in style, as third-ranked UCLA stayed unbeaten in Big Ten play with a decisive victory at Minnesota.\n\nThe smooth-shooting senior guard was in the spotlight on Wednesday night, with a career high-tying 25 points, but that's not the goal on this well-connected, fiercely determined and richly talented Bruins team.\n\nWith the Gophers and their nation-leading defense trying everything they could to limit star Lauren Betts around the basket, this was prime time for Rice to take over.\n\n“She came here with a single focus, to help our team win at levels they’d never won before, but on top of that, what do you think WNBA teams are looking for? Winners,” UCLA coach Cori Close said. “Ones that not only know how to bring the skill development and the skills to their particular teams, but who helps make the team winners, and I don’t think that can be stated strong enough. Does someone want to pick a stat line? Or do they want to pick a winner?”\n\nThe 5-foot-11 Rice, who added five assists, four rebounds and three steals while shooting 8 for 9 from the floor, 3 for 3 from 3-point range and 6 for 6 from the free-throw line against Minnesota, is a sure-bet first-round pick whenever the WNBA holds its next draft, with a new collective bargaining agreement needed first.\n\nBetts could be the top pick. Gabriela Jaquez, Angela Dugalic and newcomers Gianna Kneepkens and Charlisse Leger-Walker are all WNBA prospects, too, and they're all in their final year.\n\n“This is just a special group, and I’m a really lucky coach to be able to be a part of their lives,” said Close, who's in her 15th season with the Bruins after leading them to their first Final Four appearance last spring.\n\nThe players clearly feel that way, too.\n\n“I just want this team to win, so whatever it takes I’m going to be able to do that,” Rice said.\n\nRice's season-best performance was made possible by the Bruins following their game plan to put the Gophers post players in frequent ball-screen situations and her working hard to take advantage.\n\nWith Betts on the bench in early foul trouble in the second quarter in a six-point game, the Gophers — who entered the game allowing an average of just over 51 points per game — were putting on a clinic on a defensive possession until Rice found space in the corner for a 3-pointer to beat the shot clock and make it 25-16.\n\n“They’re such a physical team, and that wears on you and all of a sudden you can’t get to a coverage as quickly because you got worn down. It’s every cut. It’s every screen. It’s every drive. It’s every rebound. It’s every post-up opportunity,\" Minnesota coach Dawn Plitzuweit said. “Kiki Rice made us pay.\"\n\nUCLA is the best-shooting team in the Big Ten and fifth in the nation, entering the night with a 50.8% percentage from the floor. The Bruins are also third in the country in assists.\n\nThe Gophers made the 6-foot-7 Betts work for everything she got, flexing their feisty defense and forcing the Bruins into 17 turnovers. But the AP preseason All-American senior stayed on the floor and didn’t lose her aggressiveness after picking up her third foul early in the third quarter, and UCLA's lead stayed in double digits for the entire second half on the way to a 76-58 win.\n\n“Playing with Lauren has been one of the best parts of being at UCLA,” Rice said of her teammate who transferred from Stanford three years ago. “Being able to play with a great big like her, not many people in college basketball get the opportunity to do that.”\n\nBetts leaned over toward Rice after the compliment as they sat together at a podium following the game, flashing a smile of gratitude.\n\n“If they’re going to send two or three people at me, it just creates such good opportunities for the guards,” Betts said. “They all can handle themselves really well, and we have such amazing shooters so it makes my job pretty easy.”\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "fullText": "PARIS (AP) — Lens has gone from surprise front-runner to serious title contender in Ligue 1.\n\nDespite having modest resources, coach Pierre Sage has done remarkably well to keep his side ahead of defending champion Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nCash-rich PSG clinched a record-extending 13th league title last season while Lens won its only title in 1998. But Lens pushed PSG close in 2022-23 and finished runner-up by one point.\n\nLens is one point ahead of PSG this season and eight clear of third-place Marseille going into this weekend's 18th round of games.\n\nSage’s side will be confident of a club record-extending 10th straight win in all competitions when it hosts next-to-last Auxerre on Saturday.\n\nExcellent teamwork and a strong defense are hallmarks of a Lens side which has five clean sheets in the past nine games.\n\nPSG has a tricky home match against fourth-placed Lille on Friday at Parc des Princes, just days after being knocked out of the French Cup at home by capital city rival Paris FC.\n\nInconsistent Marseille is at mid-table Angers on Saturday and can ill afford to drop any points with Lille level on points.\n\nErratic Monaco has tumbled to midtable and needs to bounce back with a home win against Lorient on Friday.\n\nLyon fans will be hoping to see Brazil forward Endrick in action at home to Brest on Sunday.\n\nEndrick is on loan from Real Madrid until the end of the season and scored on his club debut in the French Cup on Sunday.\n\nAfter missing 14 games due to a shoulder injury, Marseille forward Amine Gouiri is finding his form. He scored twice and provided one assist in a 9-0 French Cup win on Tuesday.\n\nNantes has earned a reputation over the years for having a strong youth academy and Tylel Tati is the latest to come through. The 17-year-old central defender looked assured in a 2-0 win at Marseille and looks set to feature at home to Paris FC on Sunday. Forward Jonathan Ikoné seeks his first league goal of the season after his neat finish knocked title holder PSG — his former club — out of the French Cup.\n\nPaul Pogba's move to Monaco is not working out as planned and the former France midfield star remains sidelined with a calf injury.\n\nThe 2018 World Cup winner has also dealt with thigh and ankle problems since joining the club in the offseason, after more than two years out of the game in a career derailed by injuries, off-field problems and a doping ban.\n\nPogba hoped to relaunch his career in time to make France's squad for the World Cup later this year but has so far played only 30 minutes in three substitute appearances for Monaco.\n\nMonaco's injury list is long, including defender Mohammed Salisu (ACL), winger Ansu Fati (hamstring), goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky (knee) and winger Takumi Minamino (ACL).\n\nForwards Jérémie Boga and Terem Moffi are reportedly trying to terminate their contracts with Nice after being attacked by their own supporters following a game on Nov. 30.\n\nAfter a 3-1 defeat at Lorient made it six straight losses, Nice players were confronted by a large number of angry Nice fans when they returned to the club’s training and academy center.\n\nBoga and Moffi took blows to the head and groin and have since been on medical leave.

    "fullText": "Around 2 million Ukrainians are dodging military drafts, while another 200,000 are absent without official leave, or AWOL, Kyiv's newly appointed defense minister said on Wednesday.\n\nThe tally revealed by Mykhailo Fedorov is a rare disclosure by the Ukrainian leadership about the troop shortages the country has grappled with throughout the war.\n\nFedorov, who was previously minister of digital transformation, was speaking in Ukraine's parliament as representatives confirmed his new appointment in the defense role.\n\nThe defense minister said roughly 2 million Ukrainians are \"wanted\" for evading callups, with another 200,000 soldiers voluntarily leaving their posts without permission to do so.\n\nFedorov has pledged wide reform, saying he would audit Ukraine's military and root out systemic issues \"that have accumulated over the years\" in training and command.\n\n\"We cannot fight with new technologies under an old organizational structure,\" Fedorov said.\n\nUnder martial law in Ukraine, going AWOL is defined as being away without permission for more than three days, an act that can carry a prison sentence of between five to 10 years. Desertion is when a soldier is deemed to be intentionally avoiding service and carries a more severe sentence of up to 12 years in prison.\n\nA soldier could go AWOL if they are given a break from the fighting or leave to return home, then fail to show up when ordered to do so. Sometimes, troops simply flee their positions.\n\nThe figures relayed by Fedorov may be affected by a notorious tactic among Ukrainian troops seeking to transfer to another unit, especially if they were previously denied. Some soldiers try to circumvent the official process by going AWOL and then reporting for duty again with a recommendation for their desired unit.\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general's office told local media outlet Ukrainska Pravda last year that, from the start of the war to September 2025, it had opened over 235,000 criminal cases for AWOL-related offenses, as well as over 53,000 for desertion.\n\nAs a loose comparison, some records say that a rough total of 150,000 American and British troops deserted or went AWOL during World War II across the entire European theater.\n\nAnother key concern implied in Fedorov's speech is the sheer scale of missing recruits that Kyiv desperately needs.\n\nThe country is already straining against Russia's much larger war economy and military industrial complex, and one of its most pressing needs is to replenish its fighters on the front lines.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that his country fields around 880,000 active-duty personnel, though other estimates vary.\n\nThe lack of reinforcements is crushing both for Ukrainian morale and operational success. Without reinforcements, some Ukrainian units have reported holding frontline positions for years with barely any rest or opportunity to rotate out to see their families.\n\nIn the city of Pokrovsk, for example, Zelenskyy said that Kyiv's troops were outnumbered 1 to 8 in the fall, when Russia aggressively tried to take control of the devastated regional hub via repeated ground assaults.\n\nUkrainian men aged 25 to 60 are eligible to be called up for active duty, though those as young as 18 must register with the military. Thousands of Ukrainian men have fled overseas since the war started. Many have done so illegally; Ukraine doesn't allow men aged 23 to 60 to leave its borders.\n\nFedorov said a key focus of his audit would be to assess what Ukraine can do more efficiently with the troops it has now. One of these reform goals is to ensure basic-level staffing in all of Ukraine's drone brigades, which he said is now \"definitely lacking.\"\n\n\"Today, the top 50 out of 400 total units involved in drones provide 70% of enemy damage,\" he said. \"Imagine the potential of the defense forces if we help the remaining 350 grow.\"\n\nThe defense minister, who is 35, also said the Ukrainian military is starting the year with considerably fewer resources. Its budget for 2026 is roughly 300 billion Ukrainian hryvnias, or $7 billion, lower than that for 2025, Fedorov said.",

The former head of Ukraine’s digital transformation policies is credited with spearheading the the army's drone technology and introducing several successful e-government platforms.\n\nHis appointment was part of a broad government reshuffle that the Ukrainian leader said aimed to sharpen the focus on security, defense development and diplomacy amid a new U.S.-led push to find a peace settlement.\n\nFedorov said the defense ministry is facing a shortfall of 300 billion hryvnia ($6.9 billion) in funding needs.\n\nThe European Union will dedicate most of a massive new loan program to help fund Ukraine’s military and economy over the next two years, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday.\n\nFedorov said Ukraine’s defense sector has expanded significantly since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. At the start of the war, he said, the country had seven private drone companies and two firms developing electronic warfare systems. Today, he said, there are nearly 500 drone manufacturers and about 200 electronic warfare companies in Ukraine.\n\nHe added that some sectors have emerged from scratch, including private missile producers, which now number about 20, and more than 100 companies manufacturing ground-based robotic systems.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "The Houston Texans' defense dominated the Pittsburgh Steelers, but C.J. Stroud's sloppiness (three turnovers) was cause for concern.",
    "fullText": "PITTSBURGH — Stating the obvious here, the Houston Texans’ defense is championship caliber – to the point they may carry the entire roster to northern California themselves within the next month.\n\nThat also means the pressure is on quarterback C.J. Stroud and the other side of the ball, because not supporting what has developed into one of the most simultaneously suffocating and crushing units in recent memory would be to waste a potentially deep postseason run in a weaker AFC field.\n\nDeMeco Ryans’ unit scored twice in Houston’s 30-6 rout of the Pittsburgh Steelers in the wild-card round Monday, Jan. 13, at Acrisure Stadium. The concerning part is that Stroud’s carelessness with the football, which resulted in two fumbles lost (five fumbles total and several issues with the snap) and a red-zone interception, kept the Steelers in the game for more than three quarters despite the Texans’ defense ultimately surrendering the fewest points and yards in team postseason history.\n\n\"Bad plays happen, turnovers happen in a game,\" Ryans said. \"We bounced back and didn’t let that affect us the rest of the game.\"\n\nThe defense was credited with 12 hits against Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, whom they sacked four times.\n\nRyans liked that the offense finished the game strong regardless of prior mistakes. Stroud still displayed his flashes of greatness. There was the first third-down throw of the game to Christian Kirk for 36 yards and a third-and-15 completion to Kirk for 46 yards on the final play of the third quarter, which flipped the field and led to a Ka'imi Fairbairn field goal that made it 10-6.\n\n\"He didn’t waver,\" Ryans said of Stroud. \"You can easily go in the tank, but he didn’t waver. That’s who he is. He is a resilient young man who’s able to bounce back. Anybody can go in the tank (after) you drop the ball a few times. You keep battling. Like, the game isn’t over.\"\n\nIn Ryans’ third season (and Stroud’s), the Texans are 3-0 in wild-card games. They are the second head coach-quarterback duo since 1950 to make it to the divisional round in each of their first three seasons in the NFL. They will try to avoid going 0-3 in that round Sunday on the road against the New England Patriots (3 p.m. ET, ESPN/ABC).\n\n\"It was an outstanding defensive performance, one of the best that I’ve seen versus a really talented offense, talented quarterback who has played at a high level for a long time,\" Ryans said of facing Rodgers. \"So, I’m proud of our defensive performance. I think this is the best performance we’ve had in our team history, so I’m proud of our guys for that.\"\n\nThe dam eventually broke with less than 12 minutes in the fourth quarter when Rodgers dropped back and Will Anderson Jr. curled around the edge to his blind side. The 2023 No. 3 overall pick dislodged the pigskin while demolishing Rodgers, and Sheldon Rankins picked it up and ran 33 yards for a touchdown to make it 17-6. Calen Bullock intercepted Rodgers with the game already out of reach but housed it 50 yards to make it 30-6.\n\n\"I think our defense has played like this all year,\" Stroud said. \"They've held us up. I think this is one of the best performances I've ever seen. It's crazy to think the last three wild-card games I've played in they've always had a pick six and some type of two-turnover game. When you have a defense like that it's really, really encouraging.\"\n\nThe offensive line, a sore spot for the past two seasons that has clouded Stroud’s development, held up against a Steelers’ front that could have been more disruptive. Instead, the blockers gave Stroud plenty of time and were difference-makers in the run game. Rookie Woody Marks went for a season-high 112 rushing yards on 19 attempts, while Nick Chubb ran hard for 48 yards on 10 carries. Stroud completed 21 of 32 passes for 250 passing yards, and six different receivers caught at least two passes, with Kirk leading the way (8 catches, 144 yards, 1 touchdown). Nico Collins’ concussion will be something to monitor leading into the matchup against New England.\n\nThe line was instrumental in sustaining two lengthy touchdown drives. The first was a 14-play, 92-yard sequence in which the Texans rushed seven times for 55 yards and took 7:01 off the clock. Marks’ 13-yard touchdown with 3:43 left in the fourth capped a five-minute, 51-second possession. Stroud’s efficiency on third down – the Texans started the game 7-for-9 – was another positive. Stroud said every teammate has a high standard of accountability.\n\n\"It's not just on C.J., not just on me,\" Stroud said. \"I've been on teams like that, where there is a lot of the pressure (on me). Everybody is, ‘I could have done this better,’ I could have done that better.’ I think it does start with me. I got to take care of the football. Other than that, I thought I played a good game.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: C.J. Stroud must play cleaner for sake of Texans' dominant defense",

    "description": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google’s AI engine inside the Pentagon network.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google’s generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military’s data as possible into the developing technology.\n\n“Very soon we will have the world’s leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,” Hegseth said in a speech at Musk’s space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas.\n\nThe announcement comes just days after Grok — which is embedded into X, the social media network owned by Musk — drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.\n\nMalaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the U.K.’s independent online safety watchdog announced an investigation Monday. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users.\n\nHegseth said Grok will go live inside the Defense Department later this month and announced that he would “make all appropriate data” from the military’s IT systems available for “AI exploitation.” He also said data from intelligence databases would be fed into AI systems.\n\nHegseth’s aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the Biden administration, which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly.\n\nThe Biden administration enacted a framework in late 2024 that directed national security agencies to expand their use of the most advanced AI systems but prohibited certain uses, such as applications that would violate constitutionally protected civil rights or any system that would automate the deployment of nuclear weapons. It is unclear if those prohibitions are still in place under the Trump administration.\n\nDuring his speech, Hegseth spoke of the need to streamline and speed up technological innovations within the military, saying, “We need innovation to come from anywhere and evolve with speed and purpose.”\n\nHe noted that the Pentagon possesses “combat-proven operational data from two decades of military and intelligence operations.”\n\n“AI is only as good as the data that it receives, and we’re going to make sure that it’s there,” Hegseth said.\n\nThe defense secretary said he wants AI systems within the Pentagon to be responsible, though he went on to say he was shrugging off any AI models “that won’t allow you to fight wars.”\n\nHegseth said his vision for military AI systems means that they operate “without ideological constraints that limit lawful military applications,” before adding that the Pentagon’s “AI will not be woke.”\n\nMusk developed and pitched Grok as an alternative to what he called “woke AI” interactions from rival chatbots like Google’s Gemini or OpenAI’s ChatGPT. In July, Grok also caused controversy after it appeared to make antisemitic comments that praised Adolf Hitler and shared several antisemitic posts.\n\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to questions about the issues with Grok.",

    "fullText": "Aaron Rodgers calls out 'Twitter experts' during passionate defense of Steelers coach Mike Tomlin originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nArguably two most important positions in football are up in the air for the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nNot only could quarterback Aaron Rodgers be heading for retirement this offseason, leaving the Steelers without a plan at the position, but head coach Mike Tomlin has been speculated as a candidate to part ways with the team after nearly two decades. After Monday's 30-6 playoff loss to the Houston Texans, the next questions for Pittsburgh revolve around Rodgers and Tomlin.\n\nIn Rodgers' opinion, however, there should be no questions over Tomlin's job security with the Steelers. The veteran quarterback spoke at-length in his postgame press conference on Monday about how silly he found it that Tomlin, one of the best coaches in NFL history, would be on the \"hot seat.\"\n\nHere's what Rodgers had to say about Mike Tomlin potentially being fired by the Steelers.\n\nWhat Aaron Rodgers said about potential NFL retirement\n\n3 reasons why Aaron Rodgers should come back for 2026 season\n\nRodgers is typically a hot commodity at his press conferences, and for many reasons, his postgame presser after Monday's playoff loss may have been his most important of the 2025 season. The question many fans wanted to know, of course, was if he'd be returning to the NFL in 2026.\n\nRodgers, however, said \"I'm not gonna talk about that.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to make any emotional decisions,\" Rodgers said. \"I'm disappointed. It was such a fun year. Lot of adversity, but a lot of fun.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to make any emotional decisions.\"\n\n–Aaron Rodgers when asked about his future. pic.twitter.com/3gU7HNNVC1\n\n— ESPN (@espn) January 13, 2026\n\nWhile Rodgers didn't have a lot to say about his own future, he did have a lot to say about Mike Tomlin's future in Pittsburgh.\n\nMORE: Will Aaron Rodgers retire?\n\nPostgame on Monday, Rodgers was asked about Tomlin, who hasn't led the Steelers to a playoff win since 2016 despite six postseason trips since then. Despite rumors that Pittsburgh could choose to part ways with its longtime coach, Rodgers wasn't buying it.\n\nIn a lengthy rant about how opinions from media and \"Twitter experts\" have affected the coach's job security, Rodgers said he disagrees with the idea that teams should move on from good coaches just because of outside pressure.\n\n\"This league has changed a lot in 21 years. When you hear conversations about the 'Mike Tomlins' of the world, the 'Matt LaFleurs' of the world, those are just two that I played for. And when I first got in the league, there wouldn't be conversations about whether those guys were on the 'hot seat,'\" Rodgers said. \"But the way that the league is covered now, and the way that there's snap decisions, and a validity given to the 'Twitter experts' and all the experts on TV now ... to me that's an absolute joke.\"\n\n\"Mike T. has had more success than damn-near everybody in the league for the last 19, 20 years. More than that, when you have the right guy, and the culture is right, you don't think about making a change. But there's a lot of pressure that comes from the outside, and obviously that sways decisions from time-to-time. But it's not how I would do things, and not how they used to be.\"\n\nAaron Rodgers, when asked about Mike Tomlin, speaks on Tomlin and on #Packers head coach Matt LaFleur after the @Steelers’ playoff loss: pic.twitter.com/gTNmgQT6Qw\n\n— Jason Wilde (@jasonjwilde) January 13, 2026\n\nRodgers was then asked another Tomlin-related question after that, and he didn't respond well.\n\n\"I’ve talked extensively about how I feel about Mike. And I just did in that f****** answer. Thanks,\" Rodgers said before walking away from the podium.\n\nAfter giving a lengthy answer in support of Mike Tomlin, Aaron Rodgers was asked another Tomlin question…\n\n“I’ve talked extensively about how I feel about Mike … and I just did in that fu**ing answer.”\n\nAnd bye. ✌️ pic.twitter.com/u7hIwzWuea\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) January 13, 2026\n\nTexans defense stifles Aaron Rodgers, Steelers in wild-card win\n\nWill Mike Tomlin, Steelers part ways after another first-round playoff exit?\n\nHow Steelers failed to take advantage of C.J.

    "description": "A 42-point effort from Luka Doncic isn't enough for the Lakers to overcome Sacramento's 59% shooting and 17 three-pointers in 124-112 a loss.",
    "fullText": "Lakers coach JJ Redick was asked before Monday's game against the Sacramento Kings how he could ensure his players wouldn't underestimate a nine-win team.\n\n“We don't look at any game as a walkover,” Redick said.\n\nThen the Kings walked all over the Lakers, taking a 20-point lead in the third quarter before winning 124-112 at Golden 1 Center.\n\nLuka Doncic did his best to keep the Lakers in the game, scoring 42 points and collecting eight assists and seven rebounds. But he scored just two points in the fourth quarter and looked slower after having his left thigh wrapped at the end of the third quarter.\n\nThe Lakers got to within seven points in the fourth, but the Kings pulled away. DeMar DeRozan scored 32 points and Russell Westbrook finished with 22 points and seven assists for the Kings (10-30), who shot 59% from the field (48-82) and made 17 three-pointers.\n\nLeBron James, who scored 22 points, wore a patch on his jersey commemorating his unprecedented 23rd NBA season in the city where he played his first NBA game. It features a silhouette of his pregame chalk toss and three colored stripes that represents the three franchises he has played on — the Lakers, Cavaliers and Heat.\n\nHe will wear the patch for the remainder of the season. After each game, the patch will be removed from his jersey, dated and shipped to a Topps’ production facility to be authenticated and inserted into a pack of trading cards.\n\nThe Lakers (23-14) looked strong from the onset when Deandre Ayton won the jump ball and eventually threw a lob pass to James for a 2-0 Lakers lead, a play that has become something the Lakers have used several times to start a game.\n\nJames hit his first four shots and the Lakers took an 8-2 lead before everything started to crumble.\n\nThey were behind 59-43 late in the second quarter. They couldn’t stop Malik Monk, who had 18 points off the bench on six-for-eight shooting, including five for six from three-point range. Monk finished with 26 points.\n\nAfter the hot start, James finished the first half going five for 12 from the field for 12 points. He finished the game shooting eight for 17.\n\nThe Lakers will play the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday night at Crypto.com Arena. When the Lakers played a back-to-back game last week, James sat out the second game. Will he do the same Tuesday?\n\n“We’ll see how he feels in the morning,” Redick said.\n\nPerhaps Rui Hachimura will make his return from right calf soreness. He was available to play Monday, but he sat out his seventh consecutive game.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "The Lakers defense went from on the mend to very weak on Monday, and it resulted in an unacceptable loss to the Kings.",
    "fullText": "After back-to-back losses to the San Antonio Spurs and Milwaukee Bucks, the Los Angeles Lakers looked to get back in the win column when they faced the struggling Sacramento Kings on Monday. Sacramento had just ended a seven-game losing streak, and it came into this game with a 9-30 record, which was the second-worst record in the Western Conference.\n\nThe Lakers got out to an early 19-10 lead thanks to some active defense and several fast-break scores. But they went cold for an extended stretch soon afterward and fell behind by as many as 16 points in the second quarter. An 11-2 Lakers run brought them to within 61-54 at halftime, but Sacramento boosted its lead to 20 minutes later, and the Lakers were never able to mount a serious rally, resulting in a 124-112 loss for them.\n\nEven without three-time All-Star center Domantas Sabonis, who has a meniscus injury, the Kings were able to steamroll L.A. with some precise execution and offense. They shot 58.5% from the field and an unbelievable 65.4% from 3-point range, and they caught Los Angeles slow on its defensive rotations to 3-point shooters. Guard Malik Monk, a former Laker, burned his old team with 26 points and seven treys off the bench. Even Russell Westbrook, another former Laker, hit four of his eight attempts from downtown.\n\nLos Angeles' defense wasn't the only problem. While it shot 48.8% overall, it was just 8-of-36 from beyond the arc and had a pronounced lack of offensive balance. Only four of its players hit double figures in scoring, and only two of its men had more than 13 points.\n\nThe Lakers are now on a three-game losing streak, and with a 23-14 record, they're still in fifth place in the Western Conference, but they're in a virtual tie with the sixth-place Phoenix Suns. They're only half a game ahead of the Houston Rockets, who are in seventh place, and they will return home to face the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday.\n\nSmart had some moments where he played effective defense, but he was a liability on the other end of the court. He missed all five of his shot attempts and scored one point, to go along with two rebounds, two assists and two steals in 31 minutes.\n\nLaRavia was another player who contributed next to nothing offensively. He missed six of his seven shot attempts and went 0-of-5 from 3-point range, and he ended up with two points, two rebounds, three assists and one steal in 31 minutes.\n\nAyton had nine rebounds in the first half and 13 for the game, including five on the offensive glass, and he went 4-of-7 from the field. While he got eight free throw attempts, which is a high and unusual amount for him, he made just five of them, which limited him to 13 points in 27 minutes. Ayton also contributed one assist and two blocks, but L.A. could've used a little more scoring from him.\n\nJames got off to a hot start in this game with several transition buckets and 10 points overall in the first quarter. But he faded afterward and finished with an anemic 22 points on 8-of-17 field-goal shooting while missing all five of his 3-point tries. He also had four rebounds, three assists and one steal in 33 minutes.\n\nDoncic, at times, almost single-handedly prevented L.A. from falling completely out of this contest early on. He had 26 first-half points on 10-of-14 shooting, with 15 of them coming in bunches during the second quarter. He tried to put his team on his back and carry it toward a comeback, but he didn't receive nearly enough help.\n\nIn all, he scored 42 points and went 16-of-25 from the field, although he was 2-of-9 from downtown. Doncic also helped out with seven rebounds, eight assists and four steals.\n\nThis was a relatively quiet night for Vanderbilt. In 26 minutes, he got four rebounds, but he missed his three field-goal attempts and went scoreless.\n\nVincent went 3-of-6 overall and 3-of-5 from downtown, giving him nine points, plus one assist and one steal, in 18 minutes. He hit two of his treys early in the fourth quarter to try to jump-start a Lakers comeback, but to no avail.\n\nHayes was fairly aggressive and energetic throughout this contest. He got 19 minutes of playing time, and he made five of his six shot attempts to finish with 12 points, while also grabbing four offensive rebounds and five total boards.\n\nKnecht got onto the court for 13 minutes and hit two of his six shot attempts, including one 3-pointer. He finished with five points, two rebounds and one assist.\n\nThe younger James, Kleber and Smith each played only during the final 1:53 of this game. The younger James hit both of his shot attempts and scored six points, while Kleber and Smith went scoreless.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers player grades: L.A. gets steamrolled by Kings",

    "fullText": "The Defense Department has spent more than a year testing a device purchased in an undercover operation that some investigators think could be the cause of a series of mysterious ailments impacting US spies, diplomats and troops that are colloquially known as Havana Syndrome, according to four sources briefed on the matter.\n\nA division of the Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations, purchased the device for millions of dollars in the waning days of the Biden administration, using funding provided by the Defense Department, according to two of the sources. Officials paid “eight figures” for the device, these people said, declining to offer a more specific number.\n\nThe device is still being studied and there is ongoing debate — and in some quarters of government, skepticism — over its link to the roughly dozens of anomalous health incidents that remain officially unexplained.\n\nCNN has asked the Pentagon, HSI and the DHS for comment. The CIA declined to comment.\n\nThe device acquired by HSI produces pulsed radio waves, one of the sources said, which some officials and academics have speculated for years could be the cause of the incidents. Although the device is not entirely Russian in origin, it contains Russian components, this person added.\n\nOfficials have long struggled to understand how a device powerful enough to cause the kind of damage some victims have reported could be made portable; that remains a core question, according to one of the sources briefed on the device. The device could fit in a backpack, this person said.\n\nThe acquisition of the device has reignited a painful and contentious debate within the US government about Havana Syndrome, known officially as “anomalous health episodes.”\n\nThe mysterious illness first emerged in late 2016, when a cluster of US diplomats stationed in the Cuban capital of Havana began reporting symptoms consistent with head trauma, including vertigo and extreme headaches. In subsequent years, there have been cases reported around the world.\n\nIn the subsequent decade the intelligence community and the Defense Department have sought to understand if those officials were the victims of some kind of directed energy attack by a foreign government — with senior intelligence officials saying publicly that there wasn’t enough evidence to support that conclusion and victims arguing that the US government has gaslit them and ignored important evidence that Russia was attacking American government officials.\n\nStill, defense officials considered their findings serious enough that they briefed the House and Senate Intelligence Committees late last year, including reference to the acquired device and its testing.\n\nOne key concern now for some officials is that if the technology proves viable it may have proliferated, several of the sources said, meaning that more than one country could now have access to a device that may be capable of causing career-ending injuries to US officials.\n\nCNN was not able to learn where — or from whom — HSI purchased the device, but HSI has a history of collaboration with the Defense Department for operations that take place all over the globe. The office has broad jurisdiction to investigate crimes linked to customs violations, including investigations into the proliferation of US-controlled technology or expertise overseas.\n\nThose investigations are “the single biggest collaboration point between HSI and the US military,” according to a former Homeland Security official.\n\nFor example, when the US military came across US technology in Afghanistan or Iraq that raised questions about how those components came to the region, it would turn to HSI, according to the official.\n\nIt was also not clear how the US government learned of the existence of the device in order to purchase it. Havana Syndrome — and its cause — have remained frustratingly opaque to both the intelligence community and the medical community.\n\nOne problem facing the medical community is that there is still not a clear definition of “anomalous health incidents” or AHIs. Tests were done, in some cases, long after symptoms began, making it harder to understand what physically happened.\n\nIn 2022, an intelligence panel investigating the cause of AHIs said that some of the episodes could “plausibly” have been caused by “pulsed electromagnetic energy” emitted by an external source.\n\nBut in 2023, the intelligence community said publicly that it could not link any cases to a foreign adversary, ruling it unlikely that the unexplained illness was the result of a targeted campaign by an enemy of the US. As recently as January of 2025, the broader intelligence community assessment remained that it was very unlikely that the symptoms were caused by a foreign actor — even as an official with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence emphasized that analysts cannot “rule out” the possibility in some small number of cases.\n\nThat stance has long incensed victims, many of whom believe strongly that intelligence exists offering black-and-white evidence that Russia is behind their symptoms, some of which have been severe enough to force retirement.\n\nSome current and former CIA officers have raised concerns that the agency soft-pedaled its investigation, CNN has previously reported.\n\nThe acquisition of the device has been treated by some victims as potential vindication.\n\n“If the [US government] has indeed uncovered such devices, then the CIA owes all the victims a f**king major and public apology for how we have been treated as pariahs,” Marc Polymeropoulos, one of the first CIA officers to go public with injuries he says he sustained in an attack in Moscow in 2017, said in a statement to CNN.\n\nCNN’s Kylie Atwood contributed to this story.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge on Monday nixed a former high-ranking Justice Department official’s attempt to join the team defending ex-Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s defense team, ruling that lawyer Bruce Fein had “no legal basis\" to do so.\n\nJudge Alvin K. Hellerstein had initially approved Fein’s application to join Maduro’s drug trafficking case but reversed course after the deposed leader’s actual lawyer, Barry Pollack, objected to his involvement.\n\nFein, an associate deputy attorney general during Ronald Reagan’s presidency, claimed in court papers that “individuals credibly situated” within Maduro’s inner circle or family had sought out his assistance. Fein claimed that Maduro “had expressed a desire” for his “assistance in this matter.”\n\nBut Hellerstein said in a written order that only Maduro has the authority to retain Fein as his lawyer, not unidentified individuals. He rejected Fein's request for the judge to summon Maduro to court to ask him if he would like Fein added to the defense team.\n\n“If Maduro wishes to retain Fein, he has the ability to do so,\" Hellerstein wrote. \"Fein cannot appoint himself to represent Maduro.\"\n\nMessages seeking comment were left Monday for Fein and Pollack.\n\nPollack, a prominent Washington lawyer whose clients have included WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, was the only lawyer with Maduro at his Jan. 5 arraignment in Manhattan federal court, days after U.S. special forces seized Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, from their home in Caracas.\n\nIn court, Maduro called it a kidnapping and declared himself a prisoner of war. Pollack told Hellerstein he expected to make “substantial” court filings challenging the legality of his military abduction\" and invoking immunity as the head of a sovereign state.\n\nAs Fein sought to join the case, Pollack said in a court filing last week that he'd spoken with Maduro and that the ex-leader confirmed to him that he doesn't know Fein and has not communicated with him, much less retained him or authorized him to join the case.\n\nFein acknowledged in a written response that he'd had no contact with Maduro by telephone, video or any other direct way.\n\nMaduro and Flores have pleaded not guilty to charges alleging he worked with drug cartels to facilitate the shipment of thousands of tons of cocaine into the U.S. They remain held without bail at a federal jail in Brooklyn and are due back in court on March 17.",

    "fullText": "The Texans' Offensive Keys To Beating Pittsburgh originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Houston Texans are known for their defense. They have two incredible pass rushers in Will Anderson Jr. and Danielle Hunter, Azeez Al-Shaair is the solid in the middle of that defense and their secondary, led by Derek Stingley Jr. and one of the best nickelbacks in the NFL, Jalen Pitre. But as it is in every game with every team, both sides of the ball count. The Texans' offense has had moments where they have shone, moments where they have disappeared, and other times where you don’t know what is going on. Their defense is Super Bowl-worthy, but the questions remain on the offensive side of the ball, starting with the Pittsburgh. Here are some things they must do to help their offense and pull off the win against the AFC North Champion Steelers.\n\nThe Texans have been predictable at times offensively. And that has led opposing defenses to know precisely how to defend them. To change that up, the rhythm has to change as well. The Texans ought to come out and take shots against the Steelers, as they did against the Chargers in Week 17. They scored on big-time plays in the first quarter and took an early lead that they never relinquished. In the playoffs, getting an early lead is enormous and would be beneficial for the Texans, especially their defense, as it would allow their pass-rushers to pin their ears back just a little bit more. And besides, the Steelers' defense showed they can be fooled when they think they know what you are doing.\n\nThis is already going to be a challenging game for the Pittsburgh Steelers offense, so don’t give them any help. The Texans have had times where they have given up the football and helped other teams stay in the game. Texans quarterback CJ Stroud has to value the football even when pressure is coming at him. Throw the football away or take the sack as opposed to throwing the football up for grabs. That is the best way to get beaten by Pittsburgh: to put your defense in bad positions. The less you do that and the more you make Pittsburgh have to drive long distances to score, the better the Texans’ chances to win the game.\n\nThe Texans' offensive line has been something to watch all year, and for the most part, that hasn't been a good thing. They have missed assignments in the run and pass game, making it difficult for the offense to move the ball. They have also had moments where they have held up more consistently. In this game, they are going to need the best their offensive line has to offer. TJ Watt and Cameron Heyward are exceptional defensive talents who can cause real problems. The better the Texans perform up front, the easier it will be to support the Texans' defense. Texans offensive line: all eyes are on you tonight.\n\nMonday Night Football for the world to see. Can the Texans get it done, or will they falter in prime time? We shall see tonight. But we do know the Texans' offense will have some say-so in how this one goes.",

    "description": "New England held Los Angeles to 207 yards of offense and sacked Justin Herbert six times.",
    "fullText": "Patriots coach Mike Vrabel talked to his team about being prepared to bleed as New England entered its first playoff game since the 2021 season.\n\nThen, shortly after Milton Williams sacked the Chargers’ Justin Herbert on Sunday night to secure the Patriots’ first playoff victory in seven years, Williams celebrated with a head-butt of Vrabel.\n\nIt knocked the first-year coach backward and bloodied his lip.\n\n“The big dogs come out in January. I think Milt took that to heart,” Vrabel said. “He came over and got me pretty good. But that’s what happens.”\n\nDrake Maye threw a touchdown pass to Hunter Henry in the fourth quarter, and New England’s defense roughed up Herbert as the Patriots beat Los Angeles 16-3 in an AFC wild-card playoff game.\n\nPLAYOFF DUBBBBBBBB pic.twitter.com/xTUemyhs8f\n\n— New England Patriots (@Patriots) January 12, 2026\n\nAndy Borregales kicked three field goals for the Patriots (15-3), who hadn’t won in the postseason since their Super Bowl victory to cap the 2018 season. They’ll host the winner of Monday night’s game between Pittsburgh and Houston in the divisional round.\n\nIn his playoff debut, Maye completed 17 of 29 passes for 268 yards and ran for a team-high 66 yards.\n\n“We made plays when we had to do it,” Maye said.\n\nHe also threw an interception and lost a fumble, but the Chargers (11-7) couldn’t capitalize on those turnovers.\n\nNew England held Los Angeles to 207 yards of offense and sacked Herbert six times, with one of those resulting in a lost fumble that set up the Patriots’ TD.\n\n“It’s on us, what we do. I’ve been saying that all season,” Williams said. “We can control the game. If we do what we need to do up front, we’re going to win.”\n\nThis is the second straight season in which the Chargers have lost in the wild-card round. Herbert finished 19 of 31 for 159 yards and was his team’s leading rusher with 57 yards as he fell to 0-3 in the playoffs.\n\nHerbert was just over a month removed from surgery to repair a broken bone in his nonthrowing hand.\n\n“There was no issue,” Herbert said. “I just have to do a better job holding on to the ball.”\n\nChargers coach Jim Harbaugh said his quarterback wasn’t 100 percent.\n\nTHIS IS GORGEOUS 🎯@DrakeMaye2 | @Hunter_Henry84 \n\n📺 NBC pic.twitter.com/7TYUczWj3q\n\n— New England Patriots (@Patriots) January 12, 2026\n\n“He’s a warrior. He just gives it everything he has, all the time,” Harbaugh said, acknowledging that Herbert was limited by his hand injury. “It’s an issue, but he doesn’t flinch, like a warrior would.”\n\nThe last time the Chargers failed to score a TD in the playoffs was their 21-12 AFC championship game loss to the Patriots during the 2007 season.\n\nThe Patriots drove into the red zone on their first possession of the third quarter, but the drive ended when Maye was strip-sacked by Odafe Oweh and De’Shawn Hand recovered for the Chargers.\n\nAfter Los Angeles punted, Maye connected on a pass to Kayshon Boutte that went for 42 yards to set the Patriots up on the Chargers 27. But New England settled for a 39-yard field goal that stretched their lead to 9-3.\n\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Maye used a 16-yard pass to Boutte and a 13-yard burst by Rhamondre Stevenson to set up his precise 28-yard TD toss to Henry that put the Patriots in front 16-3.\n\nGET ON THAT!!!!!!\n\n📺 NBC pic.twitter.com/jRUgddmwbj\n\n— New England Patriots (@Patriots) January 12, 2026\n\nThe Chargers picked up back-to-back first downs to open their ensuing drive. But when Herbert dropped back to pass on the next play, linebacker K’Lavon Chaisson strip-sacked him and fell on loose ball.\n\nLos Angeles had one final possession, but it ended with Herbert getting sacked by Williams on fourth down.\n\n“It’s playoff football. It’s going to get ugly. It’s going to get nasty. But you’ve got to keep going,” Williams said.\n\nThe opening quarter had lots of action, but it took until early in the second quarter for the Patriots to end a scoreless stalemate.\n\nWith New England pinned inside its own 10 after a Chargers punt, Maye had a pass intended for Austin Hooper tipped by Teair Tart and intercepted by Daiyan Henley.\n\nLos Angeles started with the ball on the Patriots 10 but was stopped on fourth-and-2 when Herbert misfired a pass to Keenan Allen.\n\nThe Patriots took over and got some breathing room via a 48-yard catch-and-run by Stevenson.\n\nThirteen plays and a fourth-down conversion later, the drive ended with Borregales’ 23-yard field goal.\n\nPatriots: CB Carlton Davis left in the first half with a toe injury but returned. ...

    "title": "Trump's message to defense contractors: There might be a lot more money coming, but only if you deliver",
    "description": "The White House is calling for much more defense spending while pressuring contractors to prioritize production over profits.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump sent jolts through the defense industry this week by mixing talk of a $1.5 trillion defense budget with a blunt warning to contractors: Prioritize production and readiness, not Wall Street.\n\nThe apparent messaging behind a string of Truth Social posts, a new executive order, and the president's call for boosting the defense budget by 50% is that there's going to be a lot of cash on the table, but only for companies that produce and deliver weapons on time.\n\nA venture capital investor focused on aerospace and defense told Business Insider that Trump is effectively saying: \"I've got a really big pool of money here, but I'm only going to be giving it to people that are going to play ball.\"\n\nThe new executive order empowers the Pentagon to pressure contractors that it feels aren't moving fast enough and are perceived to instead be prioritizing profits for top executives and shareholder returns over production demands.\n\nThe Pentagon is now authorized to crack down on underperforming defense contractors by limiting stock buybacks and dividends, linking executive pay to production and delivery, and using contract and emergency authorities to force faster output and investment.\n\nThere are questions about the degree to which the Department of Defense can influence company decisions, but it sends a clear signal that the government intends to at least try to tell weapons makers how to run their businesses.\n\n\"MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS NOT BEING MADE FAST ENOUGH,\" Trump wrote on social media this week before singling out the major defense firm Raytheon (now RTX Corp) in a follow-up post.\n\n\"Either Raytheon steps up,\" Trump wrote, urging the company to build more facilities and equipment, \"or they will no longer be doing business with\" the government. RTX is one of the world's leading producers of missiles like the Tomahawk cruise missile; it also makes radars and sensors, among other technologies.\n\nIt's extremely unusual to see this level of federal government involvement in contractor financial decisions.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like that,\" Jerry McGinn, the director of the Center for the Industrial Base at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, told Business Insider.\n\nDefense stocks tumbled hard with the string of announcements but jumped as the Trump administration floated the possibility of a massive increase in defense spending, which would need Congress's approval.\n\nThis new push reflects growing concern that America’s defense sector has slipped, with capacity, capability, and experience today well below Cold War levels, leaving the US potentially ill-prepared for the possibility of a major war, such as a conflict with China.\n\nThe Trump administration appears to be trying to force a reset while also offering more money and more predictable demand, acknowledging the government itself has not always been a reliable customer. The hollowing out of the defense industry since the Cold War's end has left the federal government highly dependent on a few companies with the necessary industrial facilities to design and produce complex weapons on a large scale.\n\nThe administration has signaled from the get-go that the big established arms makers are in its crosshairs, with a dramatic shift in support toward agile start-ups over the primes, even if it's still making substantial business deals with them.\n\n\"We are going to completely disrupt the system that held the Army back for decades and lined the primes' pockets for so long,\" Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll said last year.\n\nThe Army's top civilian official previously said that he would like to see one of the big defense power players in the contracting world go out of business. And now there's increased pressure.\n\n\"The EO is more of a hammer,\" McGinn said of Trump's newest executive order targeting the US defense industrial base.\n\n\"It still raises a lot of questions about what's enforceable,\" he added, especially with some of the Truth Social mandates that weren't included in the executive order. But \"the strategy is all about focusing on how do you change, how do you make it more attractive for companies to invest, to build factories ahead of need.\"\n\nWith the president's new executive order on defense contracting, the companies that \"stand to lose the most\" are \"the existing primes,\" Justus Parmar, CEO of Fortuna Investments, an America-first venture capital firm, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Legacy defense companies,\" Parmar said, \"they're kind of like taxicabs. They need a bit of disruption.\" He sees the rising defense firms like the ride-share companies that changed the game.\n\nThe primes, the biggest defense contractors, are far from powerless. Their scale, capital, and decades of experience give them room to resist pressure, and in certain defense technologies, they remain the only game in town.\n\nLockheed Martin, for instance, is still producing F-35 stealth fighters, Huntington Ingalls Industries is still building aircraft carriers, and Boeing has a major contract for the new sixth-generation F-47 fighter jet.\n\nWhile some big companies didn't respond, others signaled a willingness to engage. Lockheed Martin, for instance, said it \"shares President Trump's and the Department of War's focus on speed, accountability, and results, and will continue to invest and innovate at scale to ensure our warfighters maintain a decisive advantage and are never sent into a fair fight.\"\n\nThe newcomers, the start-ups and rising firms making big plays \"have the most to gain\" from what's unfolding right now, Parmar said, calling the latest Trump moves a \"tide shift.\"\n\nPalmer Luckey, the founder of Anduril, said this week that he \"broadly\" supports the president's agenda, saying that \"it's good to scare people sometimes.\" Anduril has been pitting itself up against major defense contractors in areas of emerging tech, like collaborative combat aircraft, advanced drones designed to operate alongside piloted fighters.\n\nMcGinn said \"there's a strong recognition that we need to get more out of our defense industrial base and we need new entrants.\" New technology spaces like drones, counter-drone systems, and command and control architecture improvements are opening the doors for new players, particularly those that move fast.\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth laid out the administration's approach last November, briefing industry CEOs and releasing a new acquisition strategy aimed at overhauling what it calls an outdated system and a weakened defense industrial base.\n\nHegseth has said his focus is on building the \"arsenal of freedom\" to better prepare the US military for modern warfare.\n\nThe plan is aimed at accelerating modernization, rapidly expanding production, surging capacity, and putting military acquisition and industry on a \"wartime footing\" that favors speed and execution over process.\n\nThis process takes time though, Parmar said. \"The existing primes, they're entrenched. They're not going anywhere quickly.\"\n\n\"It's going to be a slow bleed,\" he said,\" a slow transition until some of these other companies start to get market share.\"",

    "fullText": "French AI startup Mistral has secured a major vote of confidence from its home government after landing a deal to provide AI technology to France's military.\n\nFrance's Ministry of the Armed Forces said on Thursday that it has formally notified a framework agreement with Mistral AI, giving the country's armed forces, defense agencies, and affiliated public institutions access to the company's advanced AI models, software, and services.\n\nUnder the deal overseen by the ministry's defense AI agency, Mistral's AI systems will be deployed on French-controlled infrastructure, a key priority for the military as governments grow increasingly cautious about where sensitive data is processed and which laws govern it.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post announcing the deal, Mistral said its AI systems would be deployed on France's own infrastructure and fine-tuned using defense-specific data to support operational military needs.\n\nThe financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed. Mistral was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Business Insider.\n\nThe agreement marks a significant win for Mistral, which was founded in 2023 and is valued at roughly $13.6 billion, following a 1.7 billion euro ($2 billion) funding round announced last year.\n\nThe startup has positioned itself as a European alternative to US AI heavyweights, such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, pitching its models as powerful yet more compatible with Europe's sovereignty and data control ambitions.\n\nIn its statement, translated by Business Insider, the defense ministry said the partnership is intended to strengthen France's \"technological sovereignty\" and ensure the armed forces maintain control over critical AI tools used across military operations and administration.\n\nBertrand Rondepierre, director of the ministry's defense AI agency, said the agreement represents \"a major step\" in strengthening the ministry's generative AI capabilities and preparing the armed forces for future challenges, while maintaining sovereign control over the technologies used.\n\nThe deal comes as European governments reassess their dependence on US technology in strategic sectors ranging from cloud computing to semiconductors and now AI.\n\nThe French ministry's move mirrors that of the US government, which has increasingly inked major contracts with domestic AI companies to develop tools for military and national security use, including recent deals with OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, and other defense-focused startups.\n\nAs generative AI becomes increasingly embedded in military planning, logistics, and analysis, Mistral's latest win helps to position the startup as one of Europe's key players in the race to develop sovereign alternatives to American tech giants.\n\nDo you work for Mistral and have a tip or story to share?

Legacy defenses, designed for rule-based software, cannot safeguard gen AI systems that learn and adapt from data. By combining survey data, executive interviews, and lab analysis, new research reveals systemic gaps: fragile supply chains, opaque vendor services, and an acute shortage of AI-security talent.

    "description": "All it took was a pledge for $1.5 trillion in military spending to spark a reversal in the sector.",
    "fullText": "The \"TACO trade,\" short for Trump Always Chickens Out, was one of the great market memes of 2025. Whenever the market would throw a tantrum about a Trump policy — usually related to tariffs — the president would reverse course to stem the bleeding.\n\nA similar story has played out this week within US defense stocks, with a few unique twists. Here's the minute-by-minute recap from Wednesday afternoon:\n\nIt was that last statement, 2 hours and 9 minutes after Trump's first post about defense companies, that sparked a rally in those exact same defense stocks on Thursday. The optimism of a huge spending increase had offset the initial sting of industry criticism.\n\nIt wasn't a precise TACO trade situation. It was closer to something I'd like to coin as the TUNA trade: Trump Usually Negates Announcements. The president didn't outright reverse a prior statement. He countered a bearish opinion with something bullish that counterbalanced it. There's a big difference!\n\nThe volatile episode leaves questions unanswered about the future of the industry. The knee-jerk reaction from investors was to buy/sell first, then ask questions later. What does the longer term look like?\n\nWall Street analysts generally support the idea that the additional military spending will offset any new capital restrictions.\n\n\"The changes are significant but not necessarily draconian,\" said JPMorgan analyst Seth Seifman. A \"potential budget increase would support sustained growth, taking some sting out of the executive order.\"\n\nKen Herbert, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, says large-cap defense companies will feel the squeeze more than their defense-tech counterparts, which he sees outperforming.\n\n\"Defense primes will look to de-risk major program investments by securing long-term purchase agreements, where possible,\" he added.\n\nJefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu called Trump's comments an \"overreach\" and said that they catalyzed something that was already bound to happen.\n\n\"The industry has been clear that it is ready to invest on clearer demand signals,\" she said.\n\nFrom a demand perspective, $1.5 trillion in 2027 sounds quite appealing. If all goes according to plan — and that's a big \"if\" — more stock gains could be in store for defense companies.",

    "title": "What Trump's plan to ban defense dividends and raise the military budget could mean for your portfolio",
    "description": "Defense stocks pay relatively high dividends, but there are alternative areas of the market for investors to consider if they want steady income.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump sent defense stocks on a roller coaster ride this week, and his recent executive orders on defense firms and his calls for more defense spending could impact investors' portfolios.\n\nThe president signed an order aimed at restricting some financial behavior among defense contractors, including an executive order that bans defense firms from issuing dividend payments and doing stock buybacks until they deliver a \"superior product.\" Meanwhile, Trump said on Wednesday that he wants the US military budget could raised to a record $1.5 trillion next year.\n\nBoth developments have implications for investors who have money in the defense sector, which is known for paying relatively high dividends. Lockheed Martin, for instance, has an annual dividend yield of around 2%, compared to about 1% for the broader S&P 500.\n\nHere's the rundown of how investors should be thinking about the latest news — and what it means for their portfolios.\n\nFor the most part, investors shouldn't be thinking about their long-term investments too differently. Trump's push to ban dividend payments seems largely hypothetical, and it's unclear how the president will enforce such a rule, said Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.\n\n\"It feels as though this was making another random social media announcement that will likely die on the vine,\" Hogan told Business Insider. \"I don't know you need to make a rush to judgment in terms of changing your long-term investment plans.\"\n\nBesides the threat of barring dividend payments, Trump's announcements on social media seem largely positive for defense investors, José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, said. He added that those who aren't dependent on dividend payments should remain invested in the sector, pointing to the potential for growth.\n\n\"I think that investors can look forward to improved quality from those companies, in the best-case scenario,\" he told BI.\n\nIf defense companies fall in line and pause dividend payments, that could hurt investors who specifically hold dividend-paying stocks for regular income, Torres said.\n\nBut those investors can move to other dividend-paying areas of the market. Torres encouraged investors to consider value sectors with high dividend yields, such as energy and healthcare.\n\nB. Riley's Hogan encouraged investors to consider areas like energy, consumer staples, pharmaceuticals, utilities, and other parts of the industrial sector, a broader umbrella that covers defense stocks.\n\nDividend ETFs, which track a basket of dividend-paying companies, are also an option for investors chasing dividends, he added.\n\n\"There's a lot of dividend darlings for sure,\" Hogan said. \"I think investors, if in fact they feel nervous about the potential for dividend cuts or the removal of dividends in any space, as unlikely as that prospect seems, there are ways to navigate around that.\"\n\nInvestors should be watching their bond investments, Peter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research, said.\n\nBerezin said that the significant increase in defense spending could lead to a rise in bond yields, which would mean bond prices could fall.\n\nInteractive Brokers' Torres also said he believed bond investors should \"absolutely\" be concerned about the more robust military budget, which could raise long-end bond yields in particular.\n\nLong-end bond yields have climbed in recent years as concerns have risen about the US deficit and rising levels of government debt. Higher debt levels make investors more wary of purchasing long-term US Treasurys, which means yields need to rise to attract investors. Heavy borrowing and spending are also inflationary, which could push yields higher down the road as the central bank adjusts monetary policy to keep prices under control.\n\nTorres didn't recommend selling bonds at the moment. He believes concerns around debt have caused long-end bond yields in the US to be \"too high,\" and he expects those yields to ease soon.\n\n\"I'm a bond bull at this juncture,\" he said.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump took aim at defense contractors on Wednesday in an executive order.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is targeting the bank accounts of defense contractor CEOs.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order outlining new rules for defense contractors that would ban stock buybacks and dividends \"until such time as they are able to produce a superior product, on time and on budget\" — as well as limit executive compensation.\n\nThe order stipulates that in future contracts, if the Secretary of War were unsatisfied with a company's performance, executive base salaries would be capped at current levels. Future contracts would also ensure compensation \"not be tied to short-term financial metrics\" and instead be \"linked to an on-time delivery, increased production, and all necessary facilitation of investments and operating improvements.\"\n\nThe goal, per the executive order, is to increase the speed of innovation at defense companies, rather than focus on corporate profits.\n\nTrump also took aim at the leaders of defense contractors in a series of posts on Truth Social on Wednesday.\n\n\"Executive Pay Packages in the Defense Industry are exorbitant and unjustifiable given how slowly these Companies are delivering vital Equipment to our Military,\" Trump wrote. \"Salaries, Stock Options, and every other form of Compensation are far too high for these Executives.\"\n\nHe proposed that no executive should earn \"in excess of $5 million\" until their production speed and maintenance improve, though the executive order did not cap pay at that exact amount.\n\nThe leaders of the big five defense contractors — Lockheed Martin, RTX (formerly known as Raytheon), Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics — each earned more than $18 million in total compensation in 2024, the most recent year for which data is available. Their total income was a combination of salary, incentives, stock options, and other forms of compensation, including the value of security services and changes in the value of pension funds.\n\nWhile exceeding the $5 million cap proposed by Trump by magnitudes, the CEOs' compensation pales in comparison to that of some other business leaders.\n\nDozens of CEOs earned more than them in 2024. James Robert Anderson, who runs materials manufacturer Coherent, had a pay package of more than $100 million last year. The CEOs of Starbucks, GE, and Microsoft each made more than $75 million.\n\nExecutive pay and stock transactions are part of Trump's larger plans for the military. On Wednesday evening, he said on Truth Social that America's military budget should be increased to $1.5 trillion in 2027, up from the record 2026 defense budget of $901 billion.\n\nThat sent defense stocks climbing on Thursday morning, gaining back what they'd lost following the signing of the executive order.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider regarding the order, a spokesperson for Lockheed Martin said the company \"shares President Trump's and the Department of War's focus on speed, accountability, and results, and will continue to invest and innovate at scale to ensure our warfighters maintain a decisive advantage and are never sent into a fair fight.\"\n\nBoeing and General Dynamics declined to comment, and Northrop Grumman and RTX did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

    "description": "USS Bulkeley and USS Paul Ignatius \"supported\" the operations to seize the vessel, a defense official told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "Two US Navy destroyers helped American forces chase down, board, and ultimately seize a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the North Atlantic after a weekslong chase across the ocean, a defense official told Business Insider on Thursday.\n\nThe Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers USS Bulkeley and USS Paul Ignatius \"supported\" the operations to seize the vessel, initially called Bella 1, on Wednesday, the official said.\n\nThe official declined to provide additional details about the warships' role in the seizure, citing operational security concerns.\n\nThe destroyers' involvement in the mission, which also included the Coast Guard and special operations forces, highlights the scale of the US military's efforts to capture the oil tanker, on the run since it evaded a naval blockade. Flight-tracking data showed various aircraft were airborne either shortly before or during the operation.\n\nThe UK government said it supported the operation with a tanker and Royal Air Force surveillance aircraft. A NATO official told Business Insider that the alliance's standing naval forces were not involved.\n\nBella 1, which has been described by the Trump administration as a \"dark fleet\" tanker operating in violation of sanctions, evaded a US naval blockade of sanctioned vessels near Venezuela last month and avoided attempts by the American military to board the vessel.\n\nThe tanker, sailing under the flag of Guyana, then fled north into the Atlantic, reflagged as a Russian vessel, and changed its name to the Marinera. On the run, the crew even painted the country's tricolor on the hull.\n\nThe Coast Guard pursued the tanker for weeks. The unusual chase ended on Wednesday when American forces seized the vessel in waters about halfway between the UK and Iceland.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told reporters that because the vessel had a judicial seizure order, the ship's crew is \"subject to prosecution for any applicable violation of federal law, and they will be brought to the United States for such prosecution if necessary.\"\n\nRussia's foreign ministry condemned the seizure and said that threats to prosecute the tanker's crew \"are entirely unacceptable,\" the state-owned news agency Tass reported on Thursday.\n\nSeparately, the US military said that it seized another sanctioned tanker — M/T Sophia — near the Caribbean Sea on Wednesday after it was \"conducting illicit activities\" in the region.\n\nThe back-to-back interdictions mark the latest in a string of vessel seizures that have occurred since the US announced last month that a naval blockade on sanctioned oil tankers trying to enter or leave Venezuela was going into effect.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the two tankers that were seized on Wednesday had either \"last docked\" in Venezuela or were sailing to the country.\n\n\"The United States continues to enforce the blockade against all dark fleet vessels illegally transporting Venezuelan oil to finance illicit activity, stealing from the Venezuelan people,\" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday after the operations. \"Only legitimate and lawful energy commerce — as determined by the US — will be permitted.\"\n\nThe US naval blockade was set up as part of a pressure campaign against Venezuela's former president, Nicolás Maduro, whom the US had long accused of facilitating drug trafficking and other criminal activity, allegations he denies.\n\nThe campaign also included a massive US military buildup in the Caribbean that began in August. American forces carried out dozens of airstrikes on alleged drug boats over the following months, as President Donald Trump threatened to take action against Venezuela.\n\nTensions between Trump and Maduro culminated over the weekend, when the US staged a dramatic surprise operation to capture Maduro. American forces who raided his compound in Caracas were supported by more than 150 military aircraft.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has threatened additional action against other countries near Venezuela, including Colombia, Cuba, and Mexico.",

    "description": "Trump targeted two sectors in his latest attacks: single-family homes and defense contractors.",
    "fullText": "Home is where the heart is, but not where the institutional investors are.\n\nAt least, that's President Donald Trump's proposed plan. In a post on Truth Social, he said he's \"immediately\" taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying single-family homes.\n\n\"People live in homes, not corporations,\" Trump wrote.\n\nIt was one of two attacks the president issued on the business world. The other targeted a group familiar with crosshairs: defense contractors.\n\nTrump said he would \"not permit\" defense companies to issue dividends or do stock buybacks until they sped up production. He also criticized industry executives' \"exorbitant and unjustifiable\" compensation packages.\n\nBlackstone, a large institutional investor in residential real estate, and defense contractors Northrop Grumman and Raytheon Technologies were among the companies that saw their share prices immediately drop following the posts.\n\nFor Trump, it's in line with a new form of capitalism he's ushered in during his second term. One with more government involvement in the private sector, including taking individual stakes in companies, as BI's Emily Stewart previously covered. (You can also see my ugly mug discussing the idea here.)\n\nIt's a topic we're focusing on this year at BI with our series, \"The Future of Capitalism.\"\n\nThe intention behind Trump's latest attacks seems squarely focused on his biggest opponent these days: affordability.\n\nFrom houses to groceries to everything in between, rising prices have been a real thorn in Trump's side. The president has maintained he inherited these problems from his predecessor, but that hasn't softened the blow for some Americans.\n\nOn paper, going after institutional investors in the housing market is the perfect antidote. The real-estate market has been a mess the past few years, and frustrated home buyers love to blame Wall Street.\n\nIn reality, it's not that clear-cut, as BI's James Rodriguez has previously reported.\n\nOne analysis from October 2023 found investors with at least 1,000 units in their portfolio owned just 0.73% of all single-family homes in the US. However, regions like the southeast have a more concentrated number of institutional investors.\n\nStill, the housing shortage is more likely the reason you can't find, or afford, your dream home. Trump didn't mention anything about institutional investors having to sell the houses they already own. And even if you want to, you can't really yell at boomers to start selling theirs.",

I now cannot pay dividends. I now cannot do stock buybacks if I'm not investing in new plants,\" Luckey told Bloomberg.\n\nThe Anduril founder told Bloomberg he pays himself a salary of $100,000 a year, in addition to owning \"a lot\" of Anduril.\n\nLuckey's startup, which makes autonomous weapons, is valued at $30.5 billion as of June 2025 and is considering an IPO. The company's mission is to modernize the US military through technology, including surveillance devices, air vehicles, and autonomous weapons.\n\nAs the United States hustles to modernize warfare, Anduril has emerged as the face of the defense tech boom and proved it can compete for contracts with legacy defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Boeing.\n\n\"If these companies were doing really well, and if they were living up to their end of the bargain, I don't think you would see any action from Trump or others on this. It's really a reflection of how many problems we have with our defence industrial base,\" Luckey told Bloomberg.\n\nWithout specifying, he added that he thought some of Trump's proposals \"might be bad moves\" for the defense base, but that \"in concept,\" everything should be on the table.",

    "fullText": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth aggressively jumped in to cut off Secretary of State Marco Rubio to yell at a reporter on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe two Cabinet members had just come out of a meeting to brief senators on the U.S. operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and explain the path forward.\n\nRubio had been taking a series of questions from reporters when he was asked about how much involvement in Venezuela would cost U.S. taxpayers before being cut off.\n\nThe secretary of state insisted it would not cost the U.S. any money and claimed the oil deal would not either.\n\n“None of these troops sit in a dry dock waiting for action,” Rubio said. “They’re deployed somewhere in the world. If they’re not here, they’re somewhere else.”\n\nHe argued that if the ships were not in the Caribbean, they would be ”somewhere else conducting activity.”\n\nHegseth had been standing by, at times smirking, as Rubio spoke, but then he stepped forward, forcing the Secretary of State to shift aside, so he could chime in.\n\n“I want to emphasize that question from CNN,” Hegseth said, glaring at the reporter Manu Raju before launching a verbal attack.\n\n“The questions never asked how much does it cost when they’re in the Mediterranean, or the Red Sea or the Indian Ocean or the Pacific, but now that they’re in our hemisphere and a counter cartel mission or ensuring an indicted individual comes to justice, now now you’re asking the question of cost,” Hegseth raged, gesturing his hand for emphasis. “It’s a disingenuous question to begin with.”\n\nBut the defense secretary did not stop there as he continued to rant at the reporter who tried to respond.\n\n“You’re trying to find any angle possible to undermine the success of one of the most historic military missions the world has ever seen,” Hegseth declared.\n\nThe defense secretary went on to claim that the operation in Venezuela was one that only the U.S. could accomplish and argued the world is “taking notice of that.”\n\nHe went on to tout the seizure of oil tankers being pursued by the U.S.\n\nWhile Rubio had been taking questions, Hegseth ignored follow-up attempts from reporters and instead spoke louder.\n\n“Our military is prepared to continue this as he said,” Hegseth said, gesturing back to Rubio. “The president when he speaks, he means it, means it. He’s not messing around. We’re an administration of action to advance our interests, and that is on full display.”\n\nHe then quickly stepped back without taking a single question as Rubio pointed out that the officials needed to go brief members of the House.\n\nHegseth ignored questions and beat a hasty retreat as questions were yelled about whether the U.S. would put boots on the ground and more.\n\nBefore the defense secretary’s rant in front of the cameras, Rubio attempted to lay out the Trump administration’s plan for Venezuela and insisted that, despite criticism, they’re not just winging it.\n\nHe outlined that stabilizing the country relied heavily on the “quarantine” as leverage and execution of a deal to take the oil out of Venezuela. He repeated the claim that the U.S. would take out 30 to 50 million barrels of oil and sell it.\n\n“That money would then be handled in such a way that we will control how it is disbursed in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people, not corruption, not the regime,” Rubio argued.\n\nThe secretary of state said the second phase would be making sure the U.S. has access to the Venezuelan market that’s “fair.” He said the third phase would be the transition. He did not provide a timeline.\n\nDemocratic senators coming out of the briefing slammed the Trump administration’s plan and warned many questions were left unanswered.\n\n“This is an insane plan. They are talking about stealing the Venezuelan oil at gunpoint for a period of time undefined as leverage to micromanage the country,” said Senator Chris Murphy. “The scope and insanity of that plan is absolutely stunning.”",

    "title": "5 unanswered questions about the 49ers ahead of the playoffs and any potential Super Bowl run",
    "description": "Answering questions about the 49ers on offense, defense, and special teams ahead of the playoffs",
    "fullText": "After a one-year hiatus, the San Francisco 49ers return to the playoffs. The regular season has been full of rollercoaster moments. The highs include thrilling victories over the Rams and Bears, while the lows feature losing two of the best players in the league at their respective positions.\n\nWe’ve learned a lot about Kyle Shanahan this year. Despite all the injuries the offense endured throughout the season, his scheme proved it can transcend the absence of star players. The 49ers were once again prolific offensively, finishing second in schedule-adjusted efficiency and third in success rate.\n\nIf the 49ers are going to make a playoff run, it’ll need to be on the backs of their offense. The defense showed some fight in Week 18, but the depth is depleted, and the margin for error no longer exists. Any drive that doesn’t result in points is a win for Robert Saleh.\n\nExpectations reset in the playoffs. What you did for 17 games doesn’t matter. It’s about which team executes for 50 minutes. With that in mind, let’s discuss five unanswered questions about the 49ers as they enter the playoffs.\n\nLooking at various numbers daily, the ones that show the most correlation with winning are passing success rate and generating explosive plays through the air. For the season, the 49ers finished third in passing success rate, at 53.1 percent. Since Week 11, the offense remained consistent, sitting third once more at 52.8 percent.\n\nThe 49ers’ offense was below league average this season in explosive play rate through the air, ranking 20th. They were much better in the final three games, ranking third, which is encouraging coming out of the bye week. Still, over the final 10 games, on a larger sample, the Niners were 20th.\n\nWeek 18 was a prime example of how difficult offense can be when you don’t generate explosives. The 49ers did it on one drive, and they quickly marched down the field and into the red zone. Outside of that drive, it was tough sledding for the offense.\n\nI’d expect Kyle Shanahan and his coaching staff to review the Week 13 matchup between the Eagles and the Chicago Bears and watch it closely, perhaps stealing some of the concepts involving motion.. Ben Johnson windrow dressed his way up and down the field, had Philadelphia’s second-level defenders confused, and found a way to control the game, despite only one explosive passing play. It’s possible, but it won’t be easy.\n\nThere are a couple of trains of thought when it comes to fourth-down decision-making. Before we share those, there is nothing more valuable in football than possessing the ball. The best chance you have to win in this league is when you have the ball.\n\nKnowing that, teams are either uber-aggressive on fourth down because they know their offense is potent and can pick up whatever yardage they need. Then there are the coaches with elite defenses. If you know your defense is stingy, then you can afford to go for it on fourth down because you understand there is a high probability that you get the ball back.\n\nIn Week 18, Shanahan punted the ball on 4th & 2 from San Francisco’s 43-yard line. In a game like that, where every possession is so valuable, the probability of you gaining two yards, retaining the ball, and going down to score was well worth being wrong about.\n\nThere was zero indication that your defense could get a stop up to that point. The Seahawks scored on their previous drive and reached 1st & goal at the 1-yard line on their first drive. The odds that you were going to prevent Seattle from getting to the 43 were slim. Sure enough, Shanahan punted.\n\nThe result worked out, as the Seahawks missed the field goal. However, that doesn’t feel like the right way to look at it. You still didn’t score, nor did the defense stop Seattle from getting to the yard where you punted.\n\nShanahan went for it on the next fourth down. The offense needed one yard. They didn’t convert. That doesn’t mean the decision to go was incorrect. On the ensuing drive, the defense had a free run at Sam Darnold. They should have ended the possession scoreless had Dee Winters sacked Darnold. They allowed a field goal, which works.\n\nHow aggressive will Shanahan be on fourth downs in the postseason? The strength of this team is on offense. Shanahan was correct more often than not during the regular season when it came time to go for it.\n\nAlmost every team is above 50% on correct decisions now.\n\nSharp contrast to a decade ago when only a couple teams would be > 50%.\n\nLook at Carroll/Vrabel! pic.twitter.com/9Q9grE5jdK\n\n— Computer Cowboy (@benbbaldwin) January 5, 2026\n\nThe 49ers are at their best when the offense is on the field. Even against a top defense like the Eagles, keeping the offense out there on fourth downs will give them the best chance to win.\n\nSaleh will put you in a position to make a play. The 49ers are short on talent defensively, but that doesn’t excuse the mental mistakes or missed tackles. The Niners had 23 missed tackles in Week 18, leading to 272 yards after contact.\n\nA.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith aren’t known for being YAC merchants, but they’re not easy to get on the ground. Neither is Dallas Goedert. Saquon Barkley had 759 yards after contact this season. The Eagles have playmakers who can make you look silly.\n\nThe 49ers’ secondary will be put in a position, time after time, in the playoffs to make a 1-on-1 tackle. Malik Mustapha has a broken+missed tackle percentage of 26 percent, which is the 18th-highest among all defensive backs in the NFL. Deommodore Lenoir sits at 22.8, and Ji’Ayir Brown is 22.2 percent.\n\nIt’s problematic when both of your safeties and the corner that you put in cloud coverage as the primary force defender are consistently missing tackles. That’s not on Saleh when his players are whiffing. He can’t tackle for them.\n\nYou can control tackling. It wouldn’t be surprising if the Niners started Eric Kendricks and Kyzir White this Sunday. Since Fred Warner went down, missed tackles at linebacker have been problematic. The Eagles’ offense has been bogged down all year. The last thing Saleh’s unit can afford to do is give them extra chances and free yards because of missed tackles.\n\nSeattle went 6-for-13 on third down, but went 0-for-3 in the red zone in Week 18. The Bears went 6-for-12 on third down, but were 1-for-3 in the red zone. The Colts were 5-for-10 on third downs and scored a touchdown on both of their red zone trips.\n\nTeams have no issues moving the ball on the 49ers’ defense. That’s been a given all season. The postseason success will come down to whether Saleh’s unit can get off the field on third downs or force field goals in the red zone.\n\nFor the season, the 49ers were 10th in opponent red zone touchdown scoring percentage at 53.7 percent and 50 percent during the final ten games. They were 21st in opponent third-down conversion rate, one spot behind the Eagles.\n\nIt comes back to possessing the ball. Your offense needs to be on the field. One way the 49ers’ defense can keep the offense in the game is by holding their opponent to three points or forcing a third-down stop before they reach field-goal range. It doesn’t have to be the majority of the time, either. A 40 percent third-down rate allowed should be plenty good.\n\nIn Week 18, Jake Moody missed a 24-yard field goal after doinking a kick off the upright. Eddy Pineiro’s one miss came at the end of the half from nearly 60 yards. Pineiro’s near-perfection will come in handy this postseason.\n\nThe 49ers’ opponent’s kicking percentage should also benefit them. Last year, teams kicking against the 49ers made 96 percent of their kicks. This season, it’s been a league-low 66.6 percent — nearly six percentage points better than the team in second place.\n\nThe 49ers finished the season ranked 13th in special teams DVOA. The Eagles were 24th. Thanks to Skyy Moore and Brian Robinson, San Francisco was fifth in kickoff returns. Flipping the field once in a playoff game would be huge for multiple reasons.\n\nSurprisingly, the Niners lead the league in hidden points on special teams. It’s something that has been dragging the team down, arguably every season under Shanahan. But this year it’s been one of the biggest strengths on a 12-win team.",

    "description": "The defense contractor said it plans to increase annual production of advanced Patriot missile interceptors from 600 to 2,000.",
    "fullText": "Lockheed Martin plans to dramatically ramp up production of Patriot missile interceptors, aiming to more than triple its annual output to 2,000, the defense contractor said on Tuesday.\n\nLockheed said that it had reached an agreement with the US Department of Defense to \"rapidly accelerate\" the production and delivery of its PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) interceptors over a seven-year period.\n\nThe new agreement will increase the annual production capacity of PAC-3, or Patriot Advanced Capability, interceptors from roughly 600 to 2,000. These will then be delivered to US, allied, and partner forces.\n\nGlobal demand for capable air defenses and interceptors has surged in recent years in response to the large missile attacks seen in Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine and in Middle East conflicts. The American-made MIM-104 Patriot air defense system has been at the center of both.\n\nThe surface-to-air missile system has served as the backbone of Ukraine's defense against Russian missile strikes, functioning as the top layer of an air defense network largely supported by Western-made technology. And the US military has relied on the Patriot to intercept Iranian attacks.\n\nThe high expenditure rate for Patriot interceptors over the last few years has raised concerns about future stockpiles for US and allied arsenals.\n\nJim Taiclet, Lockheed's chairman and CEO, said in a statement that the defense prime \"will create unprecedented capacity for PAC-3 MSE production, delivering at the speed our nation and allies demand.\"\n\nLockheed said that it had boosted PAC-3 MSE production by more than 60% over the past two years and delivered 620 missile interceptors in 2025, a 20% increase from 2024.\n\nThe contractor supplies 17 countries with its PAC-3 interceptors. It considers the MSE variant a \"cornerstone\" of US and European missile defense.\n\nThe Pentagon said that the agreement announced on Tuesday is a result of its new Acquisition Transformation Strategy, which Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth revealed in November and calls for increased production capacity for key weapons and munitions, among other priorities.\n\nHegseth said at the time that the Pentagon would award companies bigger and longer contracts for \"proven systems\" so that they could invest \n\nThe framework agreement announced on Tuesday \"establishes the basis for negotiating a seven-year supply contract\" that will still need Congressional approval, the Pentagon said.\n\n\"This framework agreement marks a fundamental shift in how we rapidly expand munitions production and magazine depth, and how we collaborate with our industry partners,\" said Michael Duffey, the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, in a statement.",

    "fullText": "Seven US service members were injured during the covert raid to apprehend Nicolás Maduro over the weekend, a defense official told Business Insider on Tuesday, sharing the latest update on their condition.\n\nFive of the wounded troops have already returned to duty, while two others are still recovering from their injuries, the official said.\n\n\"They are receiving excellent medical care and are well on their way to recovery,\" they said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump initially revealed Saturday morning, several hours after the operation had wrapped up, that \"a couple of guys were hit\" as US forces stormed Maduro's compound to apprehend Venezuela's now-former president and his wife, Cilia Flores.\n\nTrump later shared that all the injured service members were in \"good shape.\" He added that no US troops were killed, and no equipment was lost in this operation. A helicopter took a hit but remained operational.\n\n\"The fact that this extremely complex and grueling mission was successfully executed with so few injuries is a testament to the expertise of our joint warriors,\" the defense official said.\n\nIt's unclear what kind of injuries the troops sustained during the mission or how they were hurt. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, said on Monday that nearly 200 US personnel entered \"downtown Caracas\" as part of the operation.\n\nThe surprise US operation, called Absolute Resolve, followed months of extensive planning and rehearsal, including building a replica of Maduro's compound. On Saturday, Trump described the facility as a \"highly guarded\" building, \"like a fortress.\"\n\nLow-flying helicopters brough in apprehension teams, which included law enforcement officers and special operations forces, while dozens of other aircraft — from fighter jets and bombers to drones — cleared a path for them by striking Venezuela's air defenses.\n\nDan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters on Saturday that \"those in the air over Caracas last night were willing to give their lives for those on the ground and in the helicopters.\"\n\nAmerican forces stormed the compound under heavy fire. At some point during the operation, which began late Friday night and continued for several hours into Saturday morning, the troops were wounded. The US said everyone made it out though.\n\nDozens of Venezuelan and Cuban security personnel were killed during the US raid, according to the two militaries.",

According to The Advocate's Wilson Alexander, the Tigers are signing former Boise State safety Ty Benefield.\n\nBenefield is one of the top safeties in the portal. Per 247Sports, Benefield is the No. 33-ranked player available. The On3 Transfer Portal Industry Rankings consider Benefield top-10 at his position.\n\nBenefield brings a wealth of experience to LSU's defense, playing over 2,000 snaps in three years at Boise State. In 2025, he made 80 tackles and recorded 30 stops to go along with two interceptions and three pressures. In his career, he's racked up 71 stops, five interceptions, two forced fumbles, 15 pressures, and three sacks.\n\nBenefield is versatile. LSU returns TaMarcus Cooley and Da'Shawn Spears at safety, but LSU DC Blake Baker likes to play three safeties in his dime package. We could see Benefield assume the STAR role if LSU opts to play a traditional defensive back in that position with Harold Perkins off to the NFL.\n\nLSU is signing Boise State transfer safety Ty Benefield, a source confirmed with @theadvocatebr. There's a lot of optimism about what he can bring to the secondary.\n\nMore: https://t.co/xHhyfUkji0 pic.twitter.com/2xCAFmEfzy\n\n— Wilson Alexander (@whalexander_) January 6, 2026\n\nBenefield stands at 6-foot-2 and has the physicality to play in the box along with the athleticism to run in coverage.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: LSU football signs veteran transfer portal safety",

    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS (AP) — Nathan Chasing Horse, the former “Dances with Wolves” actor accused of sexual abuse, was temporarily thrown out of court Monday after he disrupted proceedings with demands he be allowed to fire his defense attorney a week before trial.\n\nJudge Jessica Peterson in Las Vegas ordered his jury trial to proceed next week as planned.\n\nChasing Horse has pleaded not guilty to 21 charges, including allegations that he sexually assaulted women and girls and that he filmed himself sexually abusing a girl younger than 14. Prosecutors allege he used his reputation as a spiritual leader and healer to take advantage of Native American women and girls over two decades.\n\nPeterson ordered him removed from court Monday for trying to speak over her. He argued that his attorney, Craig Mueller, did not come to visit him and did not file timely. He asked that a public defender who previously represented him be his attorney.\n\nMueller, a private defense attorney, told the court his client was ready and privately told the judge that one of his investigators had visited with Chasing Horse. He declined to comment to The Associated Press.\n\nBest known for portraying the character Smiles A Lot in the 1990 movie “Dances with Wolves,” Chasing Horse was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, which is home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.\n\nAfter starring in the Oscar-winning film, according to prosecutors, Chasing Horse began propping himself up as a self-proclaimed Lakota medicine man while traveling around North America to perform healing ceremonies. When he was arrested in 2023, he was living in a North Las Vegas house with his five wives, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe case sent shock waves across Indian Country. The original indictment was dismissed in 2024 after the Nevada Supreme Court ruled prosecutors abused the grand jury process when they provided a definition of grooming as evidence without any expert testimony. However, the court left open the possibility of charges being refiled, and a new indictment was brought later that year.\n\nProsecutors claim Chasing Horse led a cult called The Circle, and his followers believed he could speak with spirits. His victims went to him for medical help, according to a transcript from a grand jury hearing.\n\nProsecutors expect the trial to last three weeks. It is scheduled to begin Monday.",
