    "fullText": "Researchers warn generative tools are helping militant groups from neo-Nazis to the Islamic State spread ideology\n\nWhile the artificial intelligence boom is upending sections of the music industry, voice generating bots are also becoming a boon to another unlikely corner of the internet: extremist movements that are using them to recreate the voices and speeches of major figures in their milieu, and experts say it is helping them grow.\n\n“The adoption of AI-enabled translation by terrorists and extremists marks a significant evolution in digital propaganda strategies,” said Lucas Webber, a senior threat intelligence analyst at Tech Against Terrorism and a research fellow at the Soufan Center. Webber specializes in monitoring the online tools of terrorist groups and extremists around the world.\n\n“Earlier methods relied on human translators or rudimentary machine translation, often limited by language fidelity and stylistic nuance,” he said. “Now, with the rise of advanced generative AI tools, these groups are able to produce seamless, contextually accurate translations that preserve tone, emotion, and ideological intensity across multiple languages.”\n\nOn the neo-Nazi far-right, adoption of AI-voice cloning software has already become particularly prolific, with several English-language versions of Adolf Hitler’s speeches garnering tens of millions of streams across X, Instagram, TikTok, and other apps.\n\nAccording to a recent research post by the Global Network on Extremism and Technology (GNet), extremist content creators have turned to voice cloning services, specifically ElevenLabs, and feed them archival speeches from the era of the Third Reich, which are then processed into mimicking Hitler in English.\n\nNeo-Nazi accelerationists, the kinds who plot acts of terrorism against western governments to provoke a societal collapse, have also turned to these tools to spread more updated versions of their hyper-violent messaging. For example, Siege, an insurgency manual written by American neo-Nazi and proscribed terrorist James Mason that became the veritable bible to organizations like the Base and the now-defunct Atomwaffen Division, was transformed into an audiobook in late November.\n\n“For the last several months I have been involved in making an audiobook of Siege by James Mason,” said a prominent neo-Nazi influencer with a heavy presence on X and Telegram, who stitched together the audiobook with the help of AI tools.\n\n“Using a custom voice model of Mason, I re-created every newsletter and most of the attached newspaper clippings as in the original published newsletters.”\n\nThe influencer lauded the power of having Mason’s writing from “pre-internet America” and turning it into a modern-day voice.\n\n“But to hear the startling accuracy of predictions made through the early eighties really puts a milestone on the road and it changed my view of our shared cause on a fundamental level,” he said.\n\nAt its height in 2020, the Base held a book club on Siege, which was an instrumental influence on several members who discussed its benefits in a hypothetical war against the US government. A nationwide FBI counterterrorism probe eventually swept up over a dozen of its members on various terrorism related charges in the same year.\n\n“The creator of the audiobook has previously released similar AI content; however, Siege has a more notorious history,” said Joshua Fisher-Birch, a terrorism analyst at the Counter Extremism Project, “due to its cultlike status among some in the online extreme right, promotion of lone actor violence, and being required reading by several neo-Nazi groups that openly endorse terrorism and whose members have committed violent criminal acts”.\n\nWebber says pro-Islamic State media outlets on encrypted networks are currently and actively “using AI to create text-to-speech renditions of ideological content from official publications”, to supercharge the spread of their messaging by transforming “text-based propaganda into engaging multimedia narratives”.\n\nJihadist terrorist groups have found utility in AI for translations of extremist teachings from Arabic into easily digestible, multilingual content. In the past, American-imam turned al-Qaeda operative Anwar al-Awlaki, would personally have to voice English lectures for recruitment propaganda in the anglosphere. The CIA and FBI have repeatedly cited the influence of al-Awlaki’s voice as a key contagion in the spread of al-Qaeda’s message.\n\nOn Rocket.Chat – the preferred communications platform of the Islamic State, which it uses to communicate with its followers and recruits – a user posted a video clip in October with slick graphics and Japanese subtitling, remarking on the difficulties of doing that without the advent of AI.\n\n“Japanese would be an extremely hard language to translate from its original state to English while keeping its eloquence,” said the pro-Islamic State user. “It should be known that I do not use artificial intelligence for any related media, with some exceptions regarding audio.”\n\nSo far, not just the Islamic State, but groups across the ideological spectrum, have begun using free AI applications, namely OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT, to amplify their overall activities. The Base and adjacent groups have used it for the creation of imagery, while also acknowledging, as far back as 2023, the use of these tools to streamline planning and researching.\n\nCounterterrorism authorities have always viewed the internet and technological advancements as a persistent game of catch-up when it comes to keeping pace with the terror groups who exploit them. Already the Base, the Islamic State and other extremists have leveraged emergent technologies like crypto to anonymously fundraise and share files for 3D printed firearms.",

    "fullText": "Local and federal law enforcement officials on Monday celebrated the foiling of an alleged terrorist plot to detonate explosives in Los Angeles and Orange counties on New Year’s Eve.\n\nAs of Monday morning, here’s what we know — and don’t — about the scheme and those reportedly involved.\n\nFour people were arrested near Twentynine Palms on Friday “while they planned and rehearsed their attack,” said Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office Akil Davis.\n\nThey are alleged members of the Turtle Island Liberation Front, which Attorney General Pam Bondi called “far-left, pro-Palestine, anti-government and anti-capitalist.”\n\nFirst Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California Bill Essayli said they were targeting at least five “Amazon-type logistics centers” for their attacks.\n\nIn addition, a fifth person was arrested by the FBI’s New Orleans Office.\n\nOfficials on Monday outlined the plot and the arrests in broad strokes, though many details have not yet been disclosed.\n\nAside from Bondi’s description of the group, a motive for the attack has not been disclosed.\n\nSimilarly, the specific targets the group had allegedly chosen have not been made public. It’s unclear if “Amazon-type logistics centers” includes Amazon itself, its competitors or other industries.\n\nQuestions also remain about the Louisiana arrest, as officials said that person is linked to a Turtle Island subgroup created by Carroll called the “Order of the Black Lotus” but was “not directly tied” to the Southern California plot.\n\nIt’s possible more arrests are coming, as Essayli said the investigation is ongoing.\n\n“As we review that evidence, if we determine there were any other individuals who knew about this or provided any assistance, we will obviously charge them as well,” Essayli said.",

    "fullText": "A bystander is being hailed as a national “hero” after a shocking mass shooting at an iconic beach in Sydney, Australia, that was hosting a Jewish event.\n\nGraphic scenes have emerged from Bondi Beach after at least 16 people were shot dead and 38 others were injured, local police confirmed. Among the casualties was Rabbi Eli Schlanger, the assistant rabbi at the Chabad of Bondi, a Chabad official told the New York Times.\n\n“This is a targeted attack on Jewish Australians on the first day of Hanukkah, which should be a day of joy,” said Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. He added: “An attack on Jewish Australians is an attack on every Australian.”\n\nThe two shooters were a 50-year-old man who was fatally shot by police and a 24-year-old man who suffered “critical injuries,” police said.\n\nGunfire was heard on the popular beachfront around 6:47 p.m. local time Sunday, authorities said. Witnesses told the Daily Mail that they saw two men exit a vehicle close to the waterfront and begin firing dozens of rounds at beachgoers.\n\nNSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said that more than 1,000 people were at the Hannukkah event at Archer Park on the northern end of the beach when the shooting took place. “As a result of the circumstances of the incident tonight, at 9:36 p.m. this evening, I declared this to be a terrorist incident,” Lanyon said.\n\nFootage widely shared on social media shows a bystander tackling one of the gunmen, wrestling the weapon from his hands, and then turning it back on him, forcing the attacker to retreat.\n\n“It’s the most unbelievable scene I’ve ever seen,” NSW Premier Chris Minns said in a late-night press conference. “Walking to a gunman… and singlehandedly disarming him, putting his own life at risk... that man is a genuine hero and I’ve got no doubt there are many, many people alive due to his bravery.\"\n\nExtraordinary vision reportedly taken from the scene of the Bondi Beach shooting appears to a show a man heroically tackling and disarming one of the shooters.\n\nVision circulating social media shows an unidentified bystander approaching the gunman, who had just discharged his… pic.twitter.com/GJIRYJcD0W\n\n— 10 News (@10NewsAU) December 14, 2025\n\nThe hero bystander was identified by relatives as 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed. His cousin told 7News that the dad of two was shot twice and will undergo surgery.\n\n“He’s in hospital and we don’t know exactly what’s going on inside,” said the cousin, identified by the outlet only as Mustafa.\n\n“We do hope he will be fine. He’s a hero 100 percent.”\n\nIn separate footage, two men can be seen standing on a passenger bridge while firing multiple shots into the parkland that surrounds the beach.\n\n“This cowardly act of terrifying violence is shocking and painful to see and represents some of our worst fears about terrorism in Sydney,” Minns added.\n\n“This attack was designed to target Sydney’s Jewish community on the first day of Hanukkah, what should have been a night of peace and joy celebrated in that community with families and supporters, has been shattered by this horrifying, evil attack.”\n\nBondi is an area of the city with a large Jewish population, and Sunday marks the first day of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah.\n\nA “Chanukah by the Sea” event, planned for Sunday, began at 5 p.m. local time on the beach where community members were set to light the first candle on a giant Menorah, enjoy a petting farm, and receive free face painting.\n\n“Join Chabad of Bondi for our Annual Chanukah Festival as We Celebrate Jewish Life by lighting up the Iconic Bondi Beach,” the event information page reads.\n\n“This is a targeted attack on Jewish Australians on the first day of Hanukkah, which should be a day of joy, a celebration of faith,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese added at the press conference. “This is an act of evil antisemitism terrorism that has struck the heart of our nation.”\n\n“Every Australian tonight will be like me, devastated over this attack on our way of life. There is no place for this hate, violence and terrorism in our nation. Let me be clear, we will eradicate it.”\n\nTension between community groups has been increasingly strained in Australia following the outbreak of the war in Gaza in 2023.\n\nSydney has been the site of numerous pro-Palestine protests, including one demonstration in August that saw an estimated 90-300,000 people march across the famous Harbour Bridge.\n\n“The events at Bondi Beach are an absolute atrocity. A horror for the victims and a massive escalation of the hatred directed at Australia’s Jewish community,” former conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbot said on X.\n\n“There should be no place in Australia for the kind of evil we’ve seen this evening,” he added. “Thank God one bystander heroically intervened showing the good side of our country.”\n\nBondi Beach is one of the world’s most iconic beaches and a central hub of Sydney life. With close proximity to the CBD, a vibrant community, and world-class surf, this waterfront neighbourhood is known for its luxury properties and upper-class living.\n\nOn Sunday evening, the beach was packed with holidaymakers and locals cooling off in the water from the 90-degree heat when the shooting began.\n\nVideo footage of the incident shows hundreds of people sprinting across the white sand for cover as shots ring out in the background.\n\nWitnesses say dozens of shots were fired, while other imagery shows bullets and casings from high-powered rifle weaponry on the floor.\n\n“For twenty minutes, they shoot, shoot. Change magazines and just shoot,” one Israeli eyewitness told a 7 News journalist who was on the scene.\n\n“It’s terrible. In the middle of Bondi. It’s terrible.”\n\nThis community is no stranger to tragedy. The Bondi neighborhood was the subject of a mass stabbing incident in April of last year, with six people stabbed to death and 12 people injured at the Westfield Bondi Junction shopping centre. That incident was not considered a terror attack.\n\nMass shootings are rare in Australia following the Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania in 1996 in which 35 people were shot dead and a further 23 wounded. In the immediate aftermath of that event, then Prime Minister John Howard implemented a mandatory firearm buyback scheme which saw 650,000 newly prohibited firearms removed from circulation in Australia.",
