    "description": "Sen. Lindsey Graham ended meeting with Lebanese defense chief after official refused to call Hezbollah a terrorist organization, sparking tensions.",
    "fullText": "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., swiftly pulled the plug on a meeting with Lebanese Chief of Defense Gen. Rodolphe Haykal after the Lebanese official refused to confirm that the Iranian regime-backed Hezbollah movement is a terrorist organization.\n\nGraham posted to X a blunt message about his frustration with the state of Lebanon in particular and Mideast power politics in general.\n\n\"I just had a very brief meeting with the Lebanese Chief of Defense General Rodolphe Haykal. I asked him point blank if he believes Hezbollah is a terrorist organization. He said, ‘No, not in the context of Lebanon.\" With that, I ended the meeting. They are clearly a terrorist organization. Hezbollah has American blood on its hands. Just ask the U.S. Marines,\"\n\nHe continued, \"They have been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by both Republican and Democrat administrations since 1997 – for good reason. As long as this attitude exists from the Lebanese Armed Forces, I don’t think we have a reliable partner in them. I am tired of the double speak in the Middle East. Too much is at stake.\"\n\nLawmakers Question Whether Us Moving Fast Enough To Capitalize On Hezbollah's Weakened State\n\nHaykal’s refusal to recognize that Hezbollah is a terrorist organization set off security alarm bells among leading experts on the movement.\n\nMatthew Levitt, a leading scholar on Hezbollah from the Washington Institute, told Fox News Digital that, ‘Gen. Haykal’s comment is only going to further concerns that the LAF sees Hezbollah as an actor with which it should deconflict, rather than disarm. The ceasefire agreement is clear that Hezbollah must be disarmed, in both the south and north of the country. In several instances to date, the LAF appears to have shared with Hezbollah targeting intelligence obtained from Israel through the US-led mechanism rather than acting on it.\"\n\nHe added, \"At a time when the LAF is seeking international aid, purportedly to disarm Hezbollah, failing to recognize the group as an adversary not only of Israel but of Lebanon as well undermines the case for further funding.\"\n\nFox News Digital sent multiple press queries to Lebanon’s embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\nIsrael Warns Hezbollah ‘Playing With Fire,’ Presses Lebanon To Act On Weapons Pledge\n\nSarit Zehavi, a leading Israeli security expert on Hezbollah from the Israel Alma Research and Education Center, told Fox News Digital that, \"I was not surprised by what Haykal said. This is exactly the problem. Hezbollah is not designated as a terrorist organization in Lebanon. The Lebanese army... is not willing to clash with Hezbollah. Hezbollah is not willing to voluntarily disarm. It will not happen as long as there is no clash.\"\n\nZehavi claimed the Lebanese Armed Forces has \"helped Hezbollah to conceal is military activity and weapons storages in south Lebanon.\"\n\nThe U.S. brokered a ceasefire in Nov. 2024 between Hezbollah and Israel. In August, Lebanon’s government accepted an American plan to disarm the group by the end of 2025. That deadline does not seem to have been met.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Turkey, Thomas Barrack, who also serves as envoy to Syria, said at a recent Milken Institute event that Lebanon is a \"failed state.\"\n\nCartel Connection: Hezbollah And Iran Exploit Maduro’s Venezuela For Cocaine Cash\n\nBarrack said, \"The confessional system does not work. A Maronite president, a Sunni prime minister and a Shia speaker; 128 parliamentary seats split equally between Islam and Christians; everything is a deadlock.\"\n\nHe said, \"Hezbollah is a foreign terrorist by U.S. standards,\" and \"it also happens to be a large political party within Lebanon that has blocking rights… This idea of saying you have to disarm Hezbollah … you’re not actually gonna do it militarily.\"\n\nBarrack said, \"The U.S. is saying Hezbollah needs to be disarmed, Hezbollah is a foreign terrorist organization, it cannot exist. My personal opinion is you kill one terrorist, you create 10. That can’t be the answer.\" He urged the Lebanese political leadership to \"run to Israel and make a deal...there is no other answer.\"\n\nWalid Phares, an American academic expert on Hezbollah and Lebanon who has advised U.S. presidential candidates, told Fox News Digital that \"The disarming of Hezbollah is not just a U.S. and international request but also and most importantly a request by a majority of Lebanese since at least the Cedars Revolution in 2005, when 1.5 million Lebanese Christians, Druze and Sunnis rallied against the Syrian occupation and the Khomeinist militia.\"\n\nHe added, \"While the Assad forces withdrew, Hezbollah remained armed. In May 2008, the radical Shia militia conducted an urban military coup against the pro-Western government and seized full power until the Israel-Iran war, known as the 12-day war of 2025. The latter was provoked by Hezbollah siding with Hamas during the Oct. 7 war.\"\n\nFox News Digital reported in November that the Trump administration ramped up pressure on the Lebanese government to disarm Hezbollah.\n\nOriginal article",

    "title": "These are the 21 most dangerous countries for US travelers, according to the State Department",
    "description": "The US State Department warns Americans not to travel to these 21 countries due to risks like terrorism, kidnapping, and limited embassy support.",
    "fullText": "Overseas travel can be an immensely enriching experience, from learning about different cultures to seeing some of the world's greatest sights, but in some countries, it can also come with risks.\n\nThe US State Department ranks 21 countries around the world as a travel advisory level four, \"Do Not Travel\" due to risks like terrorism and kidnapping.\n\n\"All countries will rank destinations slightly differently,\" Alan Fyall, a professor of tourism at the University of Central Florida, told Business Insider.\n\nWhile they frequently overlap, the US and the UK don't have identical lists, for example. Historical and cultural ties, proximity, and level of familiarity may all play a role in shaping these lists, he said.\n\nFor some of these countries, the US has suspended embassy operations. That makes it difficult for it to assist travelers when they're in trouble, and that's part of the reason the warnings can be stringent, said Fyall.\n\n\"Do you really want to go and rescue your citizens from a country that, really, they're not that advised to go to in the first place?\" he said.\n\nThe US and UK governments also issue warnings for specific areas in some countries, such as near the Thailand-Malaysia border, the Western Desert in Egypt, or parts of Israel. In July 2025, the US State Department changed Israel and the West Bank's travel advisory from a \"do-not-travel\" to a \"reconsider travel\" country, but the level four advisory has remained for Gaza as well as the Israeli regions near the Lebanese, Syrian, or Egyptian borders.\n\nWhile some risk-takers travel to these countries for a thrill, others visit family or for business.\n\n\"Some people think the perceived risk is overstated,\" Edward Dramberger, a University of South Carolina tourism and hospitality professor, told Business Insider.\n\nFor those who travel to level-four countries, the US State Department often offers routine advice, including staying aware of your surroundings, keeping your travel documents on hand, drafting a will before travel, creating a plan to leave the country without the aid of the US government, and monitoring local news for emergency situations.\n\nNations and regions can change travel advisory levels on the US' list based on changing circumstances, but these are the 21 countries the State Department considers \"do-not-travel\" zones as of January 2026.\n\nSitting between Iran and Pakistan, mountainous Afghanistan has rugged terrain and an arid climate.\n\n\"People perceive Afghanistan as just a desolate, mountain desert country with no attributes, no culture, which is wrong,\" Dramberger said.\n\nDecades of coups, civil wars, and invasions have made the country difficult for travelers to get to know, except via the news.\n\nThe US State Department lists crime, civil unrest, terrorism, wrongful detention, health, and kidnapping among the safety concerns when traveling to Afghanistan. Medical care may be more difficult to obtain in rural areas.\n\nIn 2021, the US Embassy in Kabul closed its operations in the country.\n\nThe agency recommends that American visitors keep a low profile while in the country.\n\nOnce part of the Soviet Union, Belarus maintains close ties with its neighbor, Russia. From Gothic architecture to rare near-endangered species, Belarus has attractions for castle seekers and nature enthusiasts.\n\nIn recent years, Belarus has allowed Russia to use some of its territory to invade Ukraine.\n\nThe risk of civil unrest makes visits to Belarus unwise, according to the State Department. The US Embassy suspended operations there in 2022.\n\nAmericans traveling to Belarus should exercise the usual precautions for visiting high-risk countries and consider leaving their phones, computers, and other electronic devices behind. The State Department also recommends not accessing social media accounts while in Belarus because they may be monitored.\n\nOuagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, is a West African hub of culture and arts, and the country also has an incredible wildlife refuge, Réserve de Nazinga, near its border with Ghana.\n\nDespite the country's positive attributes, the US State Department advises that travelers avoid visiting the country.\n\nThe country's government has declared a state of emergency for several regions.\n\nTerrorism, crime, and other threats have displaced over 2 million residents, as reported by the United Nations. While the displacement crisis has been slowly decreasing, the country still finds itself engulfed in a deep humanitarian crisis.\n\nSince 2015, several citizens of countries like the US have been kidnapped in Burkina Faso, according to the US Overseas Security Advisory Council, which classifies the situation in the country as \"critical.\"\n\nWhile the US Embassy still operates in Ouagadougou, government employees are unable to travel to many parts of the country due to safety concerns, which include the threat of terrorist violence.\n\nIn January 2026, the US government began suspending visas and limiting entry for citizens of 39 countries, including Burkina Faso. As a response measure, the West African country also suspended visas for US citizens.\n\nThe US government's recommendations for lowering risk while traveling in Burkina Faso include avoiding areas where Westerners typically travel and not resisting if someone attempts to rob you.\n\nThe Central African Republic touches several other level-four countries, including Sudan and South Sudan, and is home to incredibly rich biodiversity in its national parks, including Dzanga-Sangha National Park and Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park.\n\nMany of the country's species are endangered, and its citizens have faced decades of instability, according to the United Nations.\n\nRecently, armed groups have targeted Muslims and refugees.\n\nThe US State Department considers CAR a dangerous travel destination due to threats of terrorism, crime, civil unrest, unexploded land mines, and kidnapping, as well as health concerns. US citizens can expect limited help from the US Embassy in Bangui, CAR's capital.\n\nDue to the threat of kidnapping, the US' travel advisory website suggests travelers leave DNA samples with their doctor and establish proof-of-life protocols with family or friends so they can assist you if you're abducted. The State Department also suggests keeping a low profile, avoiding travel to rebel-controlled areas, and not resisting robbery attempts.\n\nThe Caribbean country of Haiti shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic. The country, which won its independence from France in 1804, maintains some of its historic monuments, like its Citadelle Laferrière.\n\nIn recent years, the country has fallen under a state of emergency. In July 2023, the US ordered government employees to leave the country, and since 2025, the US government has enforced a ban on flights to Port-au-Prince, its capital, due to gang violence. The ban has since been extended to March 2026, and the country's capital remains cut off from US travel.\n\nIn addition to the flight ban, the country is also under a travel ban to the US, meaning that its citizens cannot enter the country, and that new visas are not being issued.\n\nIn the capital city of Port-au-Prince, local authorities have enforced curfews and \"shelter-in-place\" advisories since the beginning of the state of emergency.\n\nThe State Department has warned that armed robberies, sexual assaults, and kidnappings are among the reasons to reconsider travel to Haiti.\n\nAnyone who does go should avoid walking in the streets when possible, travel in groups, and keep vehicle doors and windows locked when driving, according to the State Department.\n\nOne way to see over 800 miles of this Middle Eastern country is the Trans-Iranian Railway, which runs from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf. Tehran, the capital, lies along the route.\n\nSome of the country's natural wonders include dormant volcanoes and the stunning limestone formations of Badab-e Surt.\n\nRight now, it's not safe for US citizens to travel to the country, according to the State Department.\n\nFollowing protests in 2022, thousands of people were arrested and tortured by Iranian authorities, according to Amnesty International.\n\nSince December 2025, massive anti-government protests have broken out in the country yet again and have recently resulted in violent crackdowns by state actors, with thousands of deaths and arrests in the tens of thousands. The Iranian government has also imposed an internet blackout in efforts to censor information about the protests.\n\nThe US government has cautioned that Iranian officials may wrongfully and arbitrarily detain or imprison US nationals and other foreigners.\n\nThe travel advisory also warns of terrorism, civil unrest, and kidnapping throughout the country.\n\nThe US doesn't have a physical embassy in Iran. The American government's travel advisory site states that visitors should have a means of leaving Iran that doesn't depend on its assistance, as it cannot provide consular support or facilitate departure from the country.\n\nFrom the Tigris and Euphrates to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, Iraq holds sites that many remember from their ancient history textbooks. Sadly, some of its artifacts were lost to looting during the 2003 Iraq invasion.\n\nSince the US invasion and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, Iraq has faced threats from terrorist groups such as ISIS.\n\nTerrorism, kidnapping, and civil unrest are enough of a risk that the State Department considers Iraq a level-four country.\n\nAs of August 2025, ISIS was still active in parts of Iraq, according to OSAC. Armed conflict and terrorist threats are dangerous at the northern borders, per the State Department.\n\nThe State Department also warns that US travelers should avoid the country's northern border and consider making arrangements with a professional security organization for any visits. US employees in the country are also forbidden from using Baghdad International Airport for travel due to security concerns.\n\nAt just over 4,000 square miles, Lebanon is just a bit bigger than Puerto Rico.\n\nA lengthy civil war from 1975 to 1990 left scars in its capital city of Beirut and beyond. In recent years, an economic crisis has taken a toll. Meanwhile, conflicts in neighboring Israel and Syria have also affected Lebanon.\n\nThe US government has said that terrorist groups operating in Lebanon put travelers at risk. There have been suicide bombings, and a gunman opened fire at the embassy in Beirut in June 2024.\n\nThe country's level four travel advisory warns of crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, armed conflict, and unexploded land mines.\n\nThe State Department also warns that US citizens should especially avoid Southern Lebanon, the country's border with Syria, and refugee settlements, urging them to depart if they are there.\n\nVisitors should take the advised security measures for high-risk countries and have a kidnapping protocol in place with family members, per the State Department.\n\nSituated between Egypt and Algeria, Libya has a coastline along the gorgeous Mediterranean Sea. Roman emperor Septimius Severus was born in Leptis Magna, an UNESCO World Heritage site with striking ruins of large, impressive buildings.\n\nViolence, including two recent civil wars, has marred the country. Armed groups have attacked hotels and airports in Tripoli, Sruman, and other cities, according to the State Department. The US Embassy hasn't been active in Tripoli since 2014.\n\nThe State Department warns of violent crime, terrorism, unexploded land mines, civil unrest, widespread kidnapping, and armed conflict throughout the country, and suggests that US citizens draft a will and consult with a professional security organization if traveling to the country.\n\nThe agency urges US citizens in the country to depart as soon as possible via commercial means, even though US commercial flights aren't allowed to operate within the country's airspace.\n\nCenturies-old mosques can be found in Mali's Timbuktu, symbols of its history as a seat of Islamic culture and learning. Its marketplace drew travelers and traders during the 15th and 16th centuries.\n\nTo the southwest of Timbuktu is Bamako, Mali's capital. Outside the city and in other parts of the country, terrorists and kidnappers target foreign visitors in the hopes of getting a ransom, according to OSAC. US personnel aren't allowed to visit nightclubs or attend concerts for safety reasons.\n\nThe State Department's advisory warns of terrorism, civil unrest, inadequate health services, and violent crime, including kidnapping, throughout the country.\n\nSome advice for traveling in Mali includes avoiding walking deserted streets at night, carrying minimal cash, not leaving valuables in your hotel, and looking for a well-lit area when stopped by police.\n\nUS citizens are also advised to avoid travel outside Bamako and to have a plan to leave an emergency plan that doesn't require help from the US government.\n\nLocated on the Bay of Bengal in Southeast Asia, Myanmar boasts a fascinating mix of architecture, from pagodas and palaces to colonial hotels and government offices. One stupa, or pagoda, the Shwedagon, is the country's most sacred Buddhist site.\n\nA coup in 2021 sparked demonstrations. The military detained protestors and used force against them and bystanders, according to the State Department.\n\nThe risk of continued civil unrest and wrongful detentions, and arbitrary arrests, as well as poor health infrastructure, land mines, and crime, makes it unwise to travel to the country, according to the US State Department travel advisory.\n\nSome armed groups have used improvised explosive devices in Yangon, Myanmar's largest city, while NGOs have reported land mines in Shan State, Chin State, and Kachin State.\n\nVisitors to the landlocked African country of Niger can explore the ancient mud-brick mosque of Grande Mosquée d'Agadez and the storied old town of Agadez, as well as see the Sahara Desert and the country's unique wildlife.\n\nIn October 2025, the US authorized that all government employees leave the country due to widespread safety concerns. Parts of the country have been under a state of emergency for over a decade, and local authorities \"require military escorts for any foreigners\" traveling outside the capital, Niamey, per the US State Department.\n\nThe agency warns of violent crime, civil unrest, terrorism, limited health services, and kidnapping throughout the country.\n\nIf they choose to visit anyway, US citizens are advised by the government to draft a will and have an emergency plan that doesn't depend on support from the US Embassy.\n\nOne of the world's most mysterious and isolated countries, North Korea shares borders with South Korea, China, and Russia. Kim Jong-Un took over the presidency in 2011, continuing a family dynasty that's been in power since the 1950s.\n\nIn 2025, North Korea reopened to Western tourists for the first time since the pandemic. The State Department warns that US nationals may be arrested and held for extended periods.\n\nIt warns that it cannot provide emergency services to its citizens who are detained, as the two countries do not have diplomatic relations.\n\nRussia's cities contain dazzling buildings, and its landscape is breathtaking. Siberia's Lake Baikal is the planet's oldest and deepest. The world's last woolly mammoths lived and died out on Wrangel Island, where polar bears, musk oxen, and walruses now congregate.\n\nDue to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the US State Department has declared it unsafe for US citizens, who may face harassment or detention. The US State Department urges every US citizen in the country to leave immediately, and notes that authorities might not inform the US government if an American is arrested.\n\nThe US' travel advisory also cited drone attacks and explosions in Moscow, St. Petersburg, locations near the Ukrainian border, and other areas.\n\nThe State Department notes there may be risks for those with dual US-Russian nationality. Because the situation is volatile, travelers should stay informed about the latest local news while visiting.\n\nDigital communications also pose a risk, and the agency advises US citizens to reconsider bringing any electronic devices into the country, as the Russian government's security services closely monitor electronic communications and can use them to arrest foreign nationals.\n\nThose who still choose to travel to the country are advised by the government to prepare for wrongful detention, draft a will, and leave DNA samples with a medical provider.\n\nLocated in the Horn of Africa, Somalia's lengthy coastline borders the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. Somali archaeologist Sada Mire has called the capital, Mogadishu, an \"unbreakable pearl,\" tracing its history as a trade center back to the first century AD.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Somalia experienced famine and civil war. Instability continued in the form of terror attacks, including a suicide bombing on a popular beach in 2024.\n\nDue to the possibility of kidnapping, terrorism, and civil unrest, the US has issued a do-not-travel advisory. The State Department notes that the US also has very limited consular services in the country and that health services in Somalia can be limited and absent in rural areas.\n\nThe State Department also advised against sailing near Somalia's coast due to piracy.\n\nIt was only during the 21st century that South Sudan declared its independence and was recognized as a sovereign state. Its neighbors include Sudan, Ethiopia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nIts short history was dominated by a civil war, and a new conflict is brewing between the military and an opposition force, which clashed near the Ethiopian border. NGOs, the UN, and others have found it difficult to accurately assess crime levels, but firearms easily cross the border from Sudan, according to OSAC.\n\nThe US State Department warns of civil unrest, violent crimes, kidnapping, unexploded land mines, and limited health services in the country and urges US citizens not to travel to the country for any reason.\n\nAnyone traveling in South Sudan should avoid its border areas and adhere to restrictions around public photography and videography, the State Department says.\n\nKhartoum, Sudan, is where the Blue and White Niles meet. Meroë is further north, where ancient Kushite rulers lived and were buried in pyramids. Some date back to the third century BCE; several have collapsed but others retain decorative carvings.\n\nCivil war threatens not only the archaeological history but locals and travelers. Officials at the US Embassy hastily evacuated Khartoum in 2023, soon after the conflict broke out. Various groups frequently engage in violent fighting, the State Department says.\n\nThe Darfur, Khartoum, and Kordofan regions have all been sites for kidnappings, according to OSAC. The Khartoum International Airport is closed.\n\nThe State Department warns of widespread violent crime, kidnapping, terrorism, unrest, unexploded land mines, and extremely limited health services in the country.\n\nThe US travel advisory suggests travelers be aware of their surroundings, especially in locations where Westerners typically visit, and that they draft a proof-of-life protocol with loved ones in case of kidnapping.\n\nNot only is Damascus the capital of Syria, but it's also the seat of cultural history. Established over 2,000 years ago, it's one of the oldest cities in the Middle East. Evidence of its Roman and Byzantine past exists alongside important Islamic monuments such as the Umayyad Mosque.\n\nDespite the allure of these ancient sites, the US doesn't recommend travel to Syria. A lengthy civil war broke out in 2011, with efforts to oust Bashar Assad from power. Since Assad resigned at the end of 2024, violence has continued to erupt in parts of western Syria.\n\nThe State Department has also warned that terrorism, kidnapping and hostage-taking, and unjust detention are risks in Syria, saying that \"no part of Syria is safe from violence.\"\n\nThe agency recommends visitors set up proof-of-life protocols with loved ones, among other precautions, before and during travel.\n\nMuch like Istanbul's Hagia Sofia, for which it was named, the Saint Sophia Cathedral serves as an eye-catching landmark in Kyiv. It's just one of the Ukrainian capital's architectural treasures.\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine in 2022, and years of fighting have ensued, mainly in the east, where the border lies. Belarusian troops are also present along its border with Ukraine.\n\nThe ongoing conflict is the principal reason the US government cautions against visiting. Areas that aren't on the frontline of fighting could still experience drone and missile attacks, the State Department notes.\n\nDrafting a will, coordinating a security plan, and creating a communication protocol with loved ones are just a few of the steps suggested on the travel advisory website.\n\nWith its dizzying height of over 3,000 feet, the Salto Ángel waterfall has drawn tourists for decades, though it's notoriously tricky to access. It's found in the southeast of Venezuela, in the Canaima National Park, in the Amazon rainforest near the border with Brazil and Guyana.\n\nThe country is in the midst of an economic and political crisis. Heavily reliant on oil for income, it suffered years of recession. In 2024, the US and several other countries refused to recognize the results of its presidential election, calling it fraudulent, BBC News reported at the time.\n\nSince then, the US has launched a multifaceted military presence that has increased naval posture and tensions in the Caribbean and led to the capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro by US military forces in January.\n\nThe US Embassy ceased operations in Caracas in 2019 amid the country's deep economic crisis. The State Department has issued warnings about arbitrary detentions and unpredictable enforcement of local laws. In 2023 and 2025, Venezuela released several Americans, some of whom were \"wrongfully detained,\" according to the US government.\n\nThe US State Department's travel advisory emphasizes the \"extreme danger to US citizens living in or traveling to Venezuela\" and urges all US citizens and lawful permanent residents to leave the country immediately.\n\nThe travel advisory warns of wrongful detention and torture, arbitrary law enforcement, civil unrest, widespread violent crime, including kidnapping, and poor health services throughout the country.\n\nTravelers who still choose to visit the country may want to hire a professional security team during their stay and prepare a will before their trip, according to the US travel advisory site.\n\nBeautiful gypsum patterns adorn red fired-brick buildings in the Old City of Sana'a. People have lived in this area of Yemen for over 2,500 years. The country is located on the Arabian Peninsula next to Saudi Arabia and Oman.\n\nYemen's civil war started over a decade ago and continues today. The threat of armed conflict continues, according to OSAC. Detained US citizens have not been allowed to contact their families or the embassy, which suspended its operations in 2015.\n\nThe US travel advisory says US citizens should avoid travel to the country due to the threat of terrorism, civil unrest, unexploded land mines, crime, including kidnapping, and health risks.\n\nThe State Department warns against visiting the Yemeni island of Socotra. Some travel companies have offered trips there with unofficial visas, which puts travelers at risk, according to the travel advisory website.",

    "fullText": "Some in the Trump administration are reportedly concerned with the speed at which officials claimed “domestic terrorism” in the aftermath of the ICE-involved shooting death of Minnesota mom Renee Good.\n\nGood was shot and killed by ICE agent Jonathan Ross, who captured the incident on his own phone as he let off three rounds after Good refused to exit her van.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem immediately accused Good of “domestic terrorism” for trying to “ram them with her vehicle.”\n\nVice President J.D. Vance and President Donald Trump all repeated Noem’s talking points, with Vance accusing the media of lying about the incident.\n\nPolitico reported Friday that “even supporters of the president” are afraid the aggressive approach “risks undermining public confidence in the ongoing investigation.”\n\nOne person close to the administration told Politico, “Do I think it’s domestic terrorism? Yeah, I do. But it might not have been wise to say that at the outset, how [Noem] said it.”\n\nAnother administration official concerned about the incident widening the political divide told Politico, “I don’t know how we recover from this.”\n\nThey continued, “This is highly problematic and not a good look and not something our government should be remotely engaged in.”\n\nVideos of the shooting incident have been circulating on social media, and some pundits have called them a “Rorschach test” for conservatives and liberals.\n\nOn Friday, Vance posted a new video angle that he claimed vindicated the officer for firing in self-defense, but liberals noted Good’s demeanor and words to the agent — “That’s fine, dude. I’m not mad at you” — before she appears to turn the steering wheel away from the agent in an apparent attempt to leave the scene.\n\nDHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin commented on the video Vance posted, telling Politico, “If you weaponize a vehicle, a deadly weapon to kill or cause bodily harm to a federal law enforcement officer, that is an act of domestic terrorism and will be prosecuted as such.”\n\nPresident Trump said Friday that he supported the FBI’s unusual move to block state officials from investigating the incident because Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) is “a stupid person.”\n\nThe post ‘I Don’t Know How We Recover From This’: Trump Officials Reportedly Worried About Quick Claims of ‘Domestic Terrorism’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Pablo Manríquez on X/MeidasTouch\n\nRep. Seth Magaziner (D-RI) shredded “idiot” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday for immediately accusing Renee Nicole Good of “domestic terrorism.”\n\nGood was killed on Thursday in Minneapolis by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross, who shot Good in the face as she attempted to drive away from another agent who had his hand on her door handle after he told her to get out of her SUV. Good was pronounced dead at the scene. The shooting was caught on video and posted on social media.\n\nShortly after the killing, Noem quickly blamed Good for her own death and accused her of engaging in terrorism against Ross and the other agents. Noem claimed that Good had attempted to “ram them with her vehicle.”\n\nA photo taken of Good’s vehicle after the shooting shows a bloodied airbag and stuffed animals for her six-year-old, whom she dropped off at school just before she was killed, in the glove compartment.\n\nPablo Manríquez of Migrant Insider caught up with Magaziner outside the Capitol on Thursday and asked for the lawmaker’s reaction to Noem’s comments. The exchange was posted by Acyn Torabi of MeidasTouch.\n\n.@PabloReports: What do you make of Kristi Noem calling Renee Good a domestic terrorist?\n\nMagaziner: Kristi Noem is an idiot. pic.twitter.com/qhEh6tUNYT\n\n“What do you make of Kristi Noem calling Renee Good a domestic terrorist?” Manríquez asked.\n\nKristi Noem’s an idiot, right? Like, she went on TV before any of the facts were in. She made up this story on TV about ICE agents trying to dig their truck out of the snow or something, which was clearly false. Like she didn’t even realize that there was gonna be video of what happened when she went up and gave a false story.\n\nEverybody in the Trump administration lies, but she’s not even good at the lie, right? And we’ve seen that over and over again. So, you know, it would be ridiculous, it would be funny if it wasn’t so sad and tragic because actual people’s lives are being ruined and in some cases ended by the lawlessness of the administration. And, again, like, if they had just done what they said they would do and just focus on people with serious criminal records, no one would be complaining, but they can’t help themselves.\n\nAfter the shooting, President Donald Trump blamed Good for the shooting, calling her a “professional agitator.” Vice President JD Vance alleged she was a “deranged leftist.”\n\nThe post ‘Kristi Noem’s an Idiot’: Congressman Shreds DHS Secretary Who ‘Didn’t Even Realize That There Was Gonna Be Video’ of ICE Killing first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "“I must apologize to — absolutely nobody”: Replit founder Amjad Masad isn’t afraid of Silicon Valley.\n\n“I must apologize to — absolutely nobody”: Replit founder Amjad Masad isn’t afraid of Silicon Valley.\n\n“Should I wear a keffiyeh to the shooting range?” Amjad Masad asked as I slid into the passenger seat of his black Mercedes sports car. The patterned Palestinian scarf has become a political lightning rod in the two years since the war in Gaza began. Masad, the founder of AI coding startup Replit, and a Palestinian by origin, wrapped it around his neck anyway.\n\nAt the shooting range in Santa Clara, we collected an assault rifle and a pistol and headed in. With the AR-22 tucked into his shoulder, Masad fired at a brisk clip, peppering bullets into a cartoon burglar. In less than two minutes, the burglar’s head was perfectly pocked with holes.\n\n“You should compete,” I suggested.\n\nHe smirked. “I always compete.”\n\nIndeed, Masad has never been shy about his competitive streak or his political beliefs — especially since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel, setting off the war in Gaza.\n\nMasad, 38, has felt obliged to speak out about Gaza ever since, calling out those in tech who, in his view, have supported Israel’s “genocide” of the Palestinian people. He quickly learned just how unpopular that opinion was in Silicon Valley.\n\nParty invitations dried up, group chats lit up with techies condemning his posts, and investors called him a “terrorist sympathizer.” One member of a firm that backed Replit publicly declared (opens in new tab) in July that he would donate any earnings from the investment to the Israel Defense Forces.\n\n“I felt like I was sort of expelled from Silicon Valley,” Masad said in November on the way to the range.\n\nBut even as Silicon Valley cooled on him, the AI boom that Masad had long bet on took off. In 2024, Replit combined its coding tools with AI to create an agent that could turn plain English prompts into pre-coded apps. After nearly a decade, the company was suddenly in the right place at exactly the right time.\n\nTwo years later, Replit is booming. In September, it raised $250 million from Prysm, Andreessen Horowitz, Amex Ventures, and others, at a valuation of $3 billion. The company hopes to create the preeminent AI coder — one so easy to use that anyone can become a software engineer. Meanwhile, Masad continues to advocate for his political beliefs.\n\n“People reached out to me to express that my words have been hurtful and that many have been deeply offended,” he posted on X over the summer (opens in new tab). “I finally realized that I must, from the bottom of my heart, apologize to — absolutely nobody.”\n\nMasad’s swagger isn’t unique among tech founders. But for many, their against-the-grain takes tend to align with the bottom line. Masad insists he speaks up even when it hurts his business. In that regard, “I’m probably the only contrarian in Silicon Valley,” he told me.\n\nAs Replit takes off, will he be able to maintain that independence?\n\nReplit’s multibillion valuation is hitched to the AI boom. Should the boom fizzle, the company could be worth nothing. But if it holds, and AI continues to remake the tech industry and the greater economy, Masad could find himself among the Valley’s next class of billionaires.\n\nReplit has plenty of competition among AI code-to-product firms (which are typically built on top of the mega LLMs). Swedish startup Lovable raised $330 million last month (opens in new tab), and Israeli company Base44 was bought by website builder Wix for $80 million this summer. All told, the AI coding sector received $4.7 billion in U.S. funding in the last year alone, according to PitchBook.\n\nTo persevere, Masad will not only have to beat his competitors with a better product but will have to earn the favor of still more investors, given the massive capital it takes to build and power Replit’s models.\n\nFor this reason, most players in AI have been pragmatic with their politics; see, for instance, how many Silicon Valley figures who previously supported liberal causes — from Marc Benioff to Mark Zuckerberg — suddenly and enthusiastically embraced the Trump White House. Or how Jensen Huang reportedly cozied (opens in new tab) up to David Sacks, hoping the AI czar would convince President Donald Trump to loosen U.S. chip restrictions and allow Nvidia to sell more products globally. Or how Sam Altman has courted Gulf royalty, landing major (opens in new tab) deals to build data centers in the region and fund OpenAI’s stateside infrastructure needs.\n\nFor the most part, Masad has been unwilling to soften his positions. With a penchant for discursive discussions on political philosophy, Masad remains eager to speak about the war in Gaza and rail against what he sees as human rights abuses committed by Israel.\n\nAnd he’s keen to take meetings with anyone who might see eye to eye on Palestine, even if they don’t agree on tech policy. Masad has spoken with New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani and messaged Lina Khan, the former chair of the Federal Trade Commission and nemesis of the tech elite. He had dinner with Tucker Carlson and lasted the obligatory three hours (opens in new tab) on “The Joe Rogan Experience.”\n\nIn short, Masad sees himself as both a champion for Palestine and a mogul in waiting. Which, particularly to other Arabs in tech, has made him a hero. “Having one of us make it in Silicon Valley — and still stay vocal on Palestine in the midst of all of this, specifically in Silicon Valley — is extremely inspirational,” said Fadi Ghandour, executive chairman at investment firm Wamda, one of the backers of Replit.\n\nAll this is a world away from Amman, Jordan, where Masad grew up. On the drive from his home in Palo Alto to the gun range, Masad told me his youthful hobbies included drift racing on Amman’s streets and shooting guns in empty lots.\n\nMasad, who speaks unexpectedly softly given his combative persona, is aware of how lucky he is. He compared his circumstances to a simulation experiment in which “if you ran the world a million times, I think 90% of them, I’m in a really bad situation. I’m in prison or dead.” Instead, “somehow I keep surviving and winning.”\n\nReplit’s multibillion valuation was in many ways the fruits of Masad’s decades-long study of how to make it in Silicon Valley. As a teen in Jordan, he avidly followed Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham, studying his blog posts and obsessively scrolling through Hacker News, the Y Combinator news feed.\n\nAfter getting his computer science degree in 2010 from Jordan’s Princess Sumaya University for Technology, he created the first iteration of what would become Replit: an open-source program for coders to work within a web browser, a novelty back when programmers needed to buy specialized software.\n\nHe posted a link to the program on Hacker News, where it went viral. That led to securing his first job in the U.S., as the founding engineer at Codecademy in New York. In 2013, he took a job as a software engineer at Facebook. By 2016, he and his wife, Haya Odeh, decided to revisit his old project from Jordan, officially founding Replit as an online platform to help developers build, collaborate, and publish their software.\n\nAs a student of Silicon Valley, Masad knew that mythmaking was just as important as the product. He began live-blogging Replit’s progress, and his efforts soon caught the attention of Graham himself. “What struck me most about him, at first, was that he was a programmers’ programmer,” Graham said. “He wasn’t just working on software to make money. He’d have been writing it no matter what.”\n\nGraham invited Masad and Odeh to apply to the Y Combinator accelerator program in 2018. They were accepted, and after completing the program, Replit landed investment from Andreessen Horowitz. With that funding and support, Replit gained traction as a tool for students to learn coding and educators to teach it. According to Masad, he turned down a $1 billion acquisition from Github, believing Replit would one day be worth exponentially more.\n\nMasad’s ultimate objective was to leverage his success in tech to help the Palestinian cause — a sentiment instilled in him by his mother. “She would tell me about all the great things I’m gonna do,” he said. “I fantasized as a kid about helping the Palestinians and ending the occupation and being an important force in the world.”\n\nBut in 2019, he effectively put the company on pause after his mother’s cancer took a turn for the worse. Masad and Odeh traveled to be with his father, a civil engineer with the Jordanian government.\n\nThe experience was traumatic for Masad. In his mother’s final days, the doctors in Jordan wouldn’t let any visitors into the ICU. Masad begged, then yelled, and they finally relented — on the condition he sign a “do not resuscitate” order. He still doesn’t understand why. By the time he got to see her, she was unconscious. “I was so angry at modern medicine,” Masad said. “So angry at modernity.” She died shortly thereafter.\n\nAfter a few months, Masad returned to Silicon Valley. He couldn’t stop thinking about civilization at large, about where the world was going, and if he could stand it — or if he could change it. He found himself agreeing with the Valley’s increasingly powerful libertarians.\n\nHe bonded with Marc Andreessen over politics and literature, and traveled to Malaysia to visit Balaji Srinivasan’s mysterious “startup society.” He grew to realize that the limitations he had assumed don’t necessarily apply. “There was an aspect of, like, ‘Fuck the system,’” Masad said. “‘We need to remake civilization.’”\n\nMasad gained a following on Twitter by bantering with tech legends about everything from coding to bitcoin to Covid vaccine skepticism. His growing stature landed him on podcasts and in glowing (opens in new tab) articles in The Wall Street Journal portraying him as a maverick. Then came the ultimate Silicon Valley validation: Graham, the idol whom he’d studied obsessively as a teenager in Jordan, started thanking him in his own blog posts.  (opens in new tab)\n\nMeanwhile, Replit was struggling. The education market turned out to be small, and the company had trouble expanding into enterprise deals. In late 2023, Replit killed its education product and the following year laid off 30 employees — right after moving into a bigger office in Foster City. “I remember walking around the office and just feeling sick to my stomach,” he said. “I felt like I let people down as well, because I sold them this big dream, and it wasn’t working.”\n\nHe had a plan, though, one he hoped would make his odyssey worth it. For years, he had proselytised on podcasts about how AI would turbocharge coding. Replit had spent years building an extensive database of coding materials — he just needed foundational companies like OpenAI and Anthropic to catch up and release an LLM capable of writing code. Once they did, Replit could plug those models into its pre-existing database and create a powerful app-building AI agent.\n\nWhile a new AI coding company would have to build out that infrastructure from scratch, Replit, Masad realized, could start miles ahead. After nearly a decade, he would finally have perfect timing.\n\nMasad had always been outspoken online. After Hamas’ terrorist attacks, as segments of the tech elite publicly lined up behind Israel, he held his ground. And his responses grew more costly.\n\nFirst, there were the public fights. Masad advised Elon Musk (opens in new tab) to “stick to his principles” when the billionaire said the slogan “from the river to the sea” was calling for genocide. (Palestinian activists say it’s a call for the peaceful liberation of the Palestinian people; pro-Israel voices say it calls for the extermination of Israel.) He clapped back (opens in new tab) at Lux Capital founding partner Josh Wolfe, who said that equating Israel’s actions in Gaza to genocide “grotesquely disgraces” Holocaust victims. And when Keith Rabois of Khosla Ventures said Masad’s “friends” (opens in new tab) were behind the Oct. 7 attack, Masad challenged him directly.\n\n“If you think my friends did that then why don’t you confront me when you see me?” Masad replied on X (opens in new tab).\n\nBut even as things got noisy in public, Masad met eerie silence professionally. “My calendar was suddenly empty, because I was talking about Palestine,” he said. “Replit was not a hot company anymore. We did a layoff. And at the same time, a lot of my friends were no longer my friends. I was no longer invited to parties.”\n\nPotential partnerships dried up. Masad became a frequent topic in pro-Israel tech groupchats, a source said, where some investors accused him of being antisemitic.\n\nA Replit investor who requested anonymity to speak candidly told me Masad’s public persona has been “really challenging,” and he’s had to defend the founder in investor circles. I asked if Masad had lost business because of his views. “I’m sure the answer is yes,” the investor said.\n\nA startup that Masad had invested in pitched another investor — and found that Masad was a liability. “He said, ‘Oh, Amjad is investing. He’s like a terrorist sympathizer. If he’s investing, I’m not investing,” Masad said he was told, though he declined to name the company or the investor.\n\nBut as Silicon Valley grew chilly, other regions beckoned.\n\nIn April 2024, with Replit a few months from launching its AI agent, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which is worth nearly $1 trillion, invited Masad and other AI thought leaders to stay at Ekland Safaris, a property in South Africa linked (opens in new tab) to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nFor Masad, it was a lifeline. Here were potential partners who didn’t care about his politics on Palestine. If anything, his Arab identity and his outspokenness made him more attractive.\n\nIn the heat of the day, a hunting guide sped Masad and other guests, including Tareq Amin, the future CEO of Saudi AI company HUMAIN, across 30,000 acres to kill kudu and wildebeest. By night, guests feasted in a grand ballroom while Masad demoed his not-yet-released AI coding agent to Saudi officials.\n\n“We’re going to be able to give a software engineer to every person,” Masad told Amin. “Anyone in the world will have a software engineer on demand.”\n\nAmin said he thought then that Replit was on “a path to build a game-changing technology.” Indeed, if the agent worked, and if the AI boom Masad had been betting on came to pass, everyone in that room stood to benefit.\n\nReplit launched its AI agent in September 2024 and within a year, revenue had reached $150 million. Amin and Masad closed a deal for Replit to be the exclusive AI coding software for Saudi governmental agencies, a partnership Masad expects to lead to “hundreds of millions” of dollars worth of business.\n\nAnd just like that, Silicon Valley wanted back in. Replit landed enterprise deals with Atlassian and Zillow, with a Meta deal in the wings, according to Masad. Replit raised its $250 million round and scored its $3 billion valuation.\n\nIt helped Masad that, in the two years since Oct. 7, there’s been rising public disapproval (opens in new tab) of the Israeli government. He also gained strength in numbers: There have been high-profile movements (opens in new tab) within Google, Amazon, and other tech giants, with employees speaking out in support of the Palestinian cause.\n\n“Today, the tide in tech has shifted,” Masad posted to X in September. (opens in new tab) “If you’ve been holding back, now is the time to speak out and call out anyone supporting or celebrating genocide.”\n\nWith Silicon Valley warming back up to him — he was on a16z’s podcast in October (opens in new tab) — Masad was invited to larger, and more controversial, audiences. He drove hours to record at Carlson’s rural Maine cabin, nodding politely when the host marveled on air at his perfect English. In July, he sat down with Rogan, talking about everything from Gaza to the Covid vaccine, which Masad has refused to take.\n\n“I tend to have a negative reaction to anyone forcing me to do something,” Masad said, prompting a “Good for you” from Rogan. “It was the same thing now with talking about Palestine and things like that. The more they come at me, the more I want to say things.”\n\nHe appears now to have the capital, both financially and socially, to draw hard lines. “There are a lot of people who care about the Palestinians but who are afraid to speak out publicly,” said Graham, who has also been an outspoken advocate for Palestine. “What Amjad and I have in common is that we don’t have to worry about being fired if we do.”\n\nMasad said Israel’s Ministry of Education had reached out around 2016 to work with Replit. “We got very close to a deal, but they were very overbearing,” he said, adding that the government had what he viewed as cumbersome requirements, like fining Replit if the service went down. The ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHe says he would never work with Israel now. “I think it’s an illegitimate and criminal government,” he told me during our gun safety training. “I mean, [Benjamin] Netanyahu is a war criminal.”\n\nWhen I pointed out that Saudi Arabia has its own abysmal human rights record, Masad drew a contrast.\n\n“I just think about how Replit is going to be used. Like, Israel is actively committing genocide and ethnic cleansing, and if you sell to the government there, it’s possible that they’re going to use it for that,” he said, pointing to the country’s use of Microsoft cloud services to track Palestinians’ phone calls. (After an investigation by The Guardian, Microsoft said it disabled the services that made the tracking possible in September. (opens in new tab))\n\nIt’s a careful, and conveniently self-serving, justification. This logic allows Replit to work with countries that Masad finds tolerable. Whether that line will hold as Replit scales is unclear.\n\nAfter the shooting range, we drove through a thick forest fog to the restaurant The Mountain House in Woodside. Over grilled venison, Masad talked about Replit’s next challenge: expanding its user base from corporate clients to everyday users. This isn’t essential — plenty of companies thrive selling enterprise software. But Masad wants Replit to be an engine for socioeconomic mobility around the world, letting anyone, anywhere, easily create apps and businesses.\n\nMasad acknowledged that if he succeeds — if Replit goes public and he becomes a billionaire — he will have the capital to make real change for Palestine, though he’s light on details. “It’s hard to plan for 20 years in the future,” he shrugged. “I just know that wealth is a prerequisite.”\n\nMargaux MacColl can be reached at [email protected]",

    "fullText": "PlayStation 4/5, Nintendo Switch/Switch 2, Xbox, PC; Square-Enix\nThis landmark role-playing game remains a revolutionary tour de force\n\nAt first glance, Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles, first released in 1997 and now available in newly remastered guise, does little to separate itself from other boilerplate fantasy fiction. There is a hero, Ramza – an idealistic nobleman with luscious blond hair who cavorts about the medieval-inspired realm of Ivalice in search of high adventure. But quickly, and with narrative elegance, the picture complicates: peasant revolutionaries duke it out with gilded monarchists; machiavellian plots plunge the kingdom into chaos. Ramza must navigate this knotty political matrix, all while experiencing his own ideological awakening.\n\nThere is a strong case to be made that Final Fantasy Tactics tells a better story than the landmark Final Fantasy VII (which saw Cloud Strife and a ragtag bunch of eco-terrorist pals taking on the shady megacorporation Shinra). And with our real-world political focus shifting from the looming threat of the climate crisis to the more pressing rise of fascism (though the two are inextricably linked), one can make the argument that Tactics is now also the more timely game.\n\nIn this remastered version, the plot still sparkles. Shakespearean dialogue is now fully voice-acted with delightfully hammy performances: you can practically feel the spittle on your face as one of the game’s royalist rotters delivers an incandescent tirade against the common folk.\n\nWithin this terrific political tapestry, you engage in the real meat of the game: turn-based combat of rare malleability. Each of your party – Ramza, lowborn Delita, and many more – has their own “job” (essentially, a character class), and these can be changed and subsequently remixed with few limitations (want to create a gun-toting mage? No problem!). This level of customisation, coupled with the exquisite diorama levels where the skirmishes take place, results in a symphonic take on chess.\n\nThese battles aren’t just riotous fun; they are also poetic. “I’ve been dealt a hand. I simply play it,” says one foe during a dramatic showdown at a cascading waterfall. The line speaks to the tragedy that gradually surfaces as you play through these square-gridded encounters – the sense that every character has been thrust into a maelstrom of events bigger than themselves. Heroes, villains, and everyone in between are but pawns on the battlefield, hurtling towards their own prefigured date with destiny.\n\nThe Ivalice Chronicles is not interested in narrative flexibility; its plot does not bend to the whims of the player like other RPGs. The story’s framing – recounted as a historical account in the distant future – makes this abundantly clear. As such, the game is less about fantasy and fairytales than history itself. Forget easy resolutions: here, events simply produce yet more events; trauma begets trauma. It is one battle after another for Ramza and his comrades.\n\nThis might sound doom-laden, and, in truth, it frequently is. Yet there is no mistaking the moral principles that suffuse writer Yasumi Matsuno’s stirring story of inequality, division, and pig-headed elites who seek to consolidate their already mighty power. Matsuno, who studied foreign policy before becoming an economic reporter, has described Final Fantasy Tactics as a work of “class struggle”. Now, in the time of No Kings protests in the US, the erosion of political rights in the UK, and the further enriching of the world’s hyperwealthy, the game feels even more resonant.\n\nRamza offers a model for resistance, and also a commentary on the struggle of opposition in such turbulent times. He is principled, uncompromising and always seeks to do right – and his reward is to be deemed a heretic by the most powerful institutions of his time.",

    "title": "'I am innocent': Maduro pleads not guilty to narco-terrorism charges in first court appearance",
    "description": "Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro had a lot to say during his first Manhattan federal court appearance.",
    "fullText": "Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro defiantly proclaimed his innocence in a Manhattan federal court Monday morning during his and his wife's first public appearance since US forces captured them in a dramatic military raid on Caracas over the weekend.\n\n\"I am innocent. I am not guilty. I am a decent man. I am still president of my country,\" Maduro told the judge through an interpreter when asked for his plea on narco-terrorism and weapons charges.\n\nHe was then interrupted by the judge, who interjected, \"A not guilty plea will be entered on behalf of Mr. Maduro.\"\n\nIt was one of several dramatic moments during the roughly 30-minute hearing, which Maduro used to protest his capture by US forces.\n\nWhen he entered the courtroom, flanked by US marshals, he wished everyone a \"Happy New Year\" in English and locked eyes with members of the press sitting in the back of the courtroom.\n\nLater, as the hearing wrapped up, a person sitting in the fourth row of the courtroom gallery stood to say Maduro would pay in the name of the Venezuelan people.\n\n\"I am a man of God, and I am a war prisoner,\" Maduro responded in Spanish as US marshals escorted him out of the courtroom.\n\nMaduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were arraigned on an indictment alleging a conspiracy to import cocaine and a related conspiracy to possess machine guns and other \"destructive devices\" in furtherance of drug trafficking. Maduro also faces a narco-terrorism conspiracy charge.\n\nThe two wore standard-issue jail garb of navy smocks over orange long-sleeve shirts with khaki pants. At their seats in the courtroom, they wore headphones to listen to their court-appointed translators.\n\nWhen he stood to address the judge, Maduro held on to the arms of his chair as he rose unsteadily. Flores, her blonde hair tied back in a bun, had several small bandages on her face. She sustained injuries during her \"abduction\" in Caracas, one of her attorneys said.\n\nDuring the packed noon hearing, US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein read the couple a summary of their charges and informed the Venezuelan president and first lady of their rights before the pair entered not guilty pleas. He addressed them as \"Mr. Maduro\" and \"Ms. Flores.\"\n\nWhen asked to confirm his identity at the start of the hearing, Maduro began by stating in firmly spoken Spanish that he is \"Presidente constitutional de la Republica Venezuela.\"\n\n\"I am here, kidnapped, since January 3, Saturday,\" Maduro said. I was captured in my home in Caracas, Venezuela.\"\n\n\"There will be a time and place to go into all this,\" the judge interrupted.\n\nAsked for her plea, Flores spoke in a quiet, hoarse voice.\n\n\"Not guilty. Completely innocent,\" she said through a court interpreter.\n\nBoth Maduro and Flores are facing health issues and will need medical attention while awaiting trial, their lawyers said.\n\n\"Miss Flores, during her abduction, sustained significant injuries, as you can see today here in court,\" defense lawyer Mark Donnelly told the judge. \"There's a belief that she may have a fracture or severe bruising on her ribs,\" the lawyer added.\n\nThe 25-page indictment filed against Maduro, his wife, son, and three others alleges that for over 25 years, Venezuelan leaders \"have abused their positions of public trust and corrupted once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States.\"\n\nMaduro was represented in court by Barry Pollack, an attorney best known for also representing WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange. Flores was represented by the Texas-based attorney Mark Donnelly and one of his law partners, Andres Sanchez.\n\nThe attorneys said they would not seek bail for Maduro or Flores on Monday, but reserved the right to seek it at a later date. Pollack told Hellerstein he anticipated \"voluminous and complicated legal practice.\"\n\n\"Mr. Maduro is the head of a sovereign state,\" Pollack said. \"He is entitled to the privileges and immunities that go with that office. In addition, there are issues about the legality of this military abduction.\"\n\nHellerstein scheduled the next court hearing for March 17.\n\nMaduro has long been a target of the US Justice Department. Manhattan federal prosecutors first indicted him in 2020, accusing him of heading the drug-trafficking network, the Cartel de los Soles.\n\nIn 2015, the nephews of Maduro's wife, Flores, were arrested in Haiti and charged with drug trafficking by the same office handling the Maduro case.\n\nThe indictment says Maduro is \"at the forefront of that corruption and has partnered with his co-conspirators to use his illegally obtained authority and the institutions he corroded to transport thousands of tons of cocaine to the United States.\"\n\nOn Saturday, President Donald Trump said the US captured the Venezuelan president following large-scale strikes on the South American nation.\n\nTrump said the US will \"run\" Venezuela until a \"safe, proper, and judicious transition\" can be facilitated. It remains unclear how the Trump administration would carry out this plan and for how long.",

In 2024, five Chinese people were killed when a suicide car bomber hit a bus in northwest Pakistan.\n\nIn August, top diplomats from Pakistan, China and Afghanistan met in Kabul and pledged to work toward extending the CPEC to Afghanistan, but the effort has not visibly advanced.\n\nPakistan has repeatedly accused Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers of sheltering the outlawed Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, which has been blamed for attacks inside Pakistan that have increased since 2021. The TTP is separate from Afghanistan’s Taliban, which has governed the country since 2021 and says it does not allow its territory to be used for attacks against other countries.\n\nTensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan have persisted since early October when Pakistan carried out airstrikes on what it described as Pakistani Taliban hideouts inside Afghanistan, killing dozens of alleged insurgents.\n\nAfghan forces retaliated by targeting Pakistani military posts and claimed to have killed 58 soldiers. Pakistan acknowledged losing 23 troops.\n\nThe fighting stopped after Qatar brokered a ceasefire in its capital Doha. The agreement was followed by more talks in Istanbul, which failed to produce additional results.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: CST highlights volume of IS-supporting accounts and says social media firms ‘putting all of us in danger’\n\nFacebook hosted terrorist propaganda that celebrated the murder of Jews and praised Islamic State, a leading anti-hate group has alleged.\n\nThe posts included celebrations of the Bondi beach massacre that the Community Security Trust says Facebook has been too slow to take down. The posts were still on Facebook on 16 December, two days after the attack, and received shares and likes.\n\nSome accounts are Britain-based and those have been reported to counter-terrorism police in the UK as a matter of urgency.\n\nOne post shows video of the aftermath of the Bondi beach attack, which was allegedly carried out by a father and son who were IS supporters, and says: “Allah is the greatest and praise to Allah.” It has clearly been viewed, with more than 100 likes, 27 comments and four shares recorded.\n\nFifteen people were killed as they celebrated the Jewish festival of Hanukah in Sydney on 14 December. One of the attackers also died.\n\nAnother post shows a photo of one of the Bondi beach gunmen and says: “The coming years of art and hell,” and contains praise for an IS leader. This had 12 shares and more than 300 likes.\n\nFacebook said it was in the process of removing some of the posts after being contacted by the Guardian, and said some had already been spotted and removed.\n\nDave Rich, the director of policy for the CST, which works to keep Jewish people safe from attack, said: “The sheer volume of IS-supporting accounts promoting terrorist content on Facebook is deeply alarming, and the posts celebrating the Bondi terrorist attack are utterly nauseating.\n\n“Yet again, social media companies are incapable of meeting even their most basic of responsibilities and are putting all of us in danger as a result. This simply should not be happening any more. We will be calling on Ofcom to urgently investigate Meta’s failings and to take strong action where possible.”\n\nOfcom, the media regulator, said: “If a post is reported to a platform now, the platform must decide whether the content is illegal under UK law, and take it down swiftly if it is. Our job is to make sure sites and apps have appropriate measures in place to comply with their duties.”\n\nIt said it had received “evidence that suggests terrorist content and illegal hate speech is persisting on some of the largest social media sites”.\n\nA spokesperson for Meta, which owns Facebook, declined to answer a series of questions but said: “The content was removed for violating our policies around dangerous organisations and individuals.”\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: “Social media content promoting terrorism or violence against communities is absolutely unacceptable, and will not be tolerated. The law is clear: social media platforms must take action to prevent illegal content on their sites, including terrorist and violent material.”\n\nThe focus on pro-IS material on popular social media sites comes amid concern about an increase in terrorist efforts to target Jewish people across the west.\n\nTwo men were convicted on 22 December of a plot to get machine guns and shoot Jewish people around the north-west of England. In that plot and the Sydney massacre, both sets of terrorists’ approaches had a degree of sophistication.\n\nThough neither was “directed” by IS, the Sydney attackers visited the Philippines and the north-west England machine-gun plotters had contact with an IS person overseas and were sophisticated enough to try to bypass Jewish community security and infiltrate a Facebook group, giving them details of potential Jewish targets.\n\nRich said of the English plot: “This is an even more serious plot than the attack on the synagogue in Heaton Park and indicates a much greater level of training and sophistication.”\n\nVicki Evans, the senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism policing, told the Guardian: “The terrorist threats we face do not stand still and we rarely confine them to history. Instead, they flex in intensity and risk over time – and so does our response.\n\n“Recent attacks in Manchester and Australia are clear reminders of the range of threats we face, and we continue to ask the public to … report any concerns they see in their real-world or online communities.”",

    "fullText": "Researchers warn generative tools are helping militant groups from neo-Nazis to the Islamic State spread ideology\n\nWhile the artificial intelligence boom is upending sections of the music industry, voice generating bots are also becoming a boon to another unlikely corner of the internet: extremist movements that are using them to recreate the voices and speeches of major figures in their milieu, and experts say it is helping them grow.\n\n“The adoption of AI-enabled translation by terrorists and extremists marks a significant evolution in digital propaganda strategies,” said Lucas Webber, a senior threat intelligence analyst at Tech Against Terrorism and a research fellow at the Soufan Center. Webber specializes in monitoring the online tools of terrorist groups and extremists around the world.\n\n“Earlier methods relied on human translators or rudimentary machine translation, often limited by language fidelity and stylistic nuance,” he said. “Now, with the rise of advanced generative AI tools, these groups are able to produce seamless, contextually accurate translations that preserve tone, emotion, and ideological intensity across multiple languages.”\n\nOn the neo-Nazi far-right, adoption of AI-voice cloning software has already become particularly prolific, with several English-language versions of Adolf Hitler’s speeches garnering tens of millions of streams across X, Instagram, TikTok, and other apps.\n\nAccording to a recent research post by the Global Network on Extremism and Technology (GNet), extremist content creators have turned to voice cloning services, specifically ElevenLabs, and feed them archival speeches from the era of the Third Reich, which are then processed into mimicking Hitler in English.\n\nNeo-Nazi accelerationists, the kinds who plot acts of terrorism against western governments to provoke a societal collapse, have also turned to these tools to spread more updated versions of their hyper-violent messaging. For example, Siege, an insurgency manual written by American neo-Nazi and proscribed terrorist James Mason that became the veritable bible to organizations like the Base and the now-defunct Atomwaffen Division, was transformed into an audiobook in late November.\n\n“For the last several months I have been involved in making an audiobook of Siege by James Mason,” said a prominent neo-Nazi influencer with a heavy presence on X and Telegram, who stitched together the audiobook with the help of AI tools.\n\n“Using a custom voice model of Mason, I re-created every newsletter and most of the attached newspaper clippings as in the original published newsletters.”\n\nThe influencer lauded the power of having Mason’s writing from “pre-internet America” and turning it into a modern-day voice.\n\n“But to hear the startling accuracy of predictions made through the early eighties really puts a milestone on the road and it changed my view of our shared cause on a fundamental level,” he said.\n\nAt its height in 2020, the Base held a book club on Siege, which was an instrumental influence on several members who discussed its benefits in a hypothetical war against the US government. A nationwide FBI counterterrorism probe eventually swept up over a dozen of its members on various terrorism related charges in the same year.\n\n“The creator of the audiobook has previously released similar AI content; however, Siege has a more notorious history,” said Joshua Fisher-Birch, a terrorism analyst at the Counter Extremism Project, “due to its cultlike status among some in the online extreme right, promotion of lone actor violence, and being required reading by several neo-Nazi groups that openly endorse terrorism and whose members have committed violent criminal acts”.\n\nWebber says pro-Islamic State media outlets on encrypted networks are currently and actively “using AI to create text-to-speech renditions of ideological content from official publications”, to supercharge the spread of their messaging by transforming “text-based propaganda into engaging multimedia narratives”.\n\nJihadist terrorist groups have found utility in AI for translations of extremist teachings from Arabic into easily digestible, multilingual content. In the past, American-imam turned al-Qaeda operative Anwar al-Awlaki, would personally have to voice English lectures for recruitment propaganda in the anglosphere. The CIA and FBI have repeatedly cited the influence of al-Awlaki’s voice as a key contagion in the spread of al-Qaeda’s message.\n\nOn Rocket.Chat – the preferred communications platform of the Islamic State, which it uses to communicate with its followers and recruits – a user posted a video clip in October with slick graphics and Japanese subtitling, remarking on the difficulties of doing that without the advent of AI.\n\n“Japanese would be an extremely hard language to translate from its original state to English while keeping its eloquence,” said the pro-Islamic State user. “It should be known that I do not use artificial intelligence for any related media, with some exceptions regarding audio.”\n\nSo far, not just the Islamic State, but groups across the ideological spectrum, have begun using free AI applications, namely OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT, to amplify their overall activities. The Base and adjacent groups have used it for the creation of imagery, while also acknowledging, as far back as 2023, the use of these tools to streamline planning and researching.\n\nCounterterrorism authorities have always viewed the internet and technological advancements as a persistent game of catch-up when it comes to keeping pace with the terror groups who exploit them. Already the Base, the Islamic State and other extremists have leveraged emergent technologies like crypto to anonymously fundraise and share files for 3D printed firearms.",

It’s unclear if “Amazon-type logistics centers” includes Amazon itself, its competitors or other industries.\n\nQuestions also remain about the Louisiana arrest, as officials said that person is linked to a Turtle Island subgroup created by Carroll called the “Order of the Black Lotus” but was “not directly tied” to the Southern California plot.\n\nIt’s possible more arrests are coming, as Essayli said the investigation is ongoing.\n\n“As we review that evidence, if we determine there were any other individuals who knew about this or provided any assistance, we will obviously charge them as well,” Essayli said.",

    "fullText": "A bystander is being hailed as a national “hero” after a shocking mass shooting at an iconic beach in Sydney, Australia, that was hosting a Jewish event.\n\nGraphic scenes have emerged from Bondi Beach after at least 16 people were shot dead and 38 others were injured, local police confirmed. Among the casualties was Rabbi Eli Schlanger, the assistant rabbi at the Chabad of Bondi, a Chabad official told the New York Times.\n\n“This is a targeted attack on Jewish Australians on the first day of Hanukkah, which should be a day of joy,” said Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. He added: “An attack on Jewish Australians is an attack on every Australian.”\n\nThe two shooters were a 50-year-old man who was fatally shot by police and a 24-year-old man who suffered “critical injuries,” police said.\n\nGunfire was heard on the popular beachfront around 6:47 p.m. local time Sunday, authorities said. Witnesses told the Daily Mail that they saw two men exit a vehicle close to the waterfront and begin firing dozens of rounds at beachgoers.\n\nNSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said that more than 1,000 people were at the Hannukkah event at Archer Park on the northern end of the beach when the shooting took place. “As a result of the circumstances of the incident tonight, at 9:36 p.m. this evening, I declared this to be a terrorist incident,” Lanyon said.\n\nFootage widely shared on social media shows a bystander tackling one of the gunmen, wrestling the weapon from his hands, and then turning it back on him, forcing the attacker to retreat.\n\n“It’s the most unbelievable scene I’ve ever seen,” NSW Premier Chris Minns said in a late-night press conference. “Walking to a gunman… and singlehandedly disarming him, putting his own life at risk... that man is a genuine hero and I’ve got no doubt there are many, many people alive due to his bravery.\"\n\nExtraordinary vision reportedly taken from the scene of the Bondi Beach shooting appears to a show a man heroically tackling and disarming one of the shooters.\n\nVision circulating social media shows an unidentified bystander approaching the gunman, who had just discharged his… pic.twitter.com/GJIRYJcD0W\n\n— 10 News (@10NewsAU) December 14, 2025\n\nThe hero bystander was identified by relatives as 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed. His cousin told 7News that the dad of two was shot twice and will undergo surgery.\n\n“He’s in hospital and we don’t know exactly what’s going on inside,” said the cousin, identified by the outlet only as Mustafa.\n\n“We do hope he will be fine. He’s a hero 100 percent.”\n\nIn separate footage, two men can be seen standing on a passenger bridge while firing multiple shots into the parkland that surrounds the beach.\n\n“This cowardly act of terrifying violence is shocking and painful to see and represents some of our worst fears about terrorism in Sydney,” Minns added.\n\n“This attack was designed to target Sydney’s Jewish community on the first day of Hanukkah, what should have been a night of peace and joy celebrated in that community with families and supporters, has been shattered by this horrifying, evil attack.”\n\nBondi is an area of the city with a large Jewish population, and Sunday marks the first day of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah.\n\nA “Chanukah by the Sea” event, planned for Sunday, began at 5 p.m. local time on the beach where community members were set to light the first candle on a giant Menorah, enjoy a petting farm, and receive free face painting.\n\n“Join Chabad of Bondi for our Annual Chanukah Festival as We Celebrate Jewish Life by lighting up the Iconic Bondi Beach,” the event information page reads.\n\n“This is a targeted attack on Jewish Australians on the first day of Hanukkah, which should be a day of joy, a celebration of faith,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese added at the press conference. “This is an act of evil antisemitism terrorism that has struck the heart of our nation.”\n\n“Every Australian tonight will be like me, devastated over this attack on our way of life. There is no place for this hate, violence and terrorism in our nation. Let me be clear, we will eradicate it.”\n\nTension between community groups has been increasingly strained in Australia following the outbreak of the war in Gaza in 2023.\n\nSydney has been the site of numerous pro-Palestine protests, including one demonstration in August that saw an estimated 90-300,000 people march across the famous Harbour Bridge.\n\n“The events at Bondi Beach are an absolute atrocity. A horror for the victims and a massive escalation of the hatred directed at Australia’s Jewish community,” former conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbot said on X.\n\n“There should be no place in Australia for the kind of evil we’ve seen this evening,” he added. “Thank God one bystander heroically intervened showing the good side of our country.”\n\nBondi Beach is one of the world’s most iconic beaches and a central hub of Sydney life. With close proximity to the CBD, a vibrant community, and world-class surf, this waterfront neighbourhood is known for its luxury properties and upper-class living.\n\nOn Sunday evening, the beach was packed with holidaymakers and locals cooling off in the water from the 90-degree heat when the shooting began.\n\nVideo footage of the incident shows hundreds of people sprinting across the white sand for cover as shots ring out in the background.\n\nWitnesses say dozens of shots were fired, while other imagery shows bullets and casings from high-powered rifle weaponry on the floor.\n\n“For twenty minutes, they shoot, shoot. Change magazines and just shoot,” one Israeli eyewitness told a 7 News journalist who was on the scene.\n\n“It’s terrible. In the middle of Bondi. It’s terrible.”\n\nThis community is no stranger to tragedy. The Bondi neighborhood was the subject of a mass stabbing incident in April of last year, with six people stabbed to death and 12 people injured at the Westfield Bondi Junction shopping centre. That incident was not considered a terror attack.\n\nMass shootings are rare in Australia following the Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania in 1996 in which 35 people were shot dead and a further 23 wounded. In the immediate aftermath of that event, then Prime Minister John Howard implemented a mandatory firearm buyback scheme which saw 650,000 newly prohibited firearms removed from circulation in Australia.",
