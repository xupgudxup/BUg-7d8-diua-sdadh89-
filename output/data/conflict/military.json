    "title": "Now Ukrainian Drones Are Taking Out The Riders (But Not The Horses) Of Russian Cavalry, What Century Am I In?",
    "description": "In strict military terms, what the Russians are deploying are probably closer to dragoons than proper cavalry.",
    "fullText": "Coming into the year 2026, Ukrainian drone operators are getting better at taking out Russian horse cavalry, and yes that is a real sentence. Over the last few weeks, the invading army appears to be experimenting with new forms of assault, given that its advance has slowed to a crawl. Large-wave attacks were neutralized by NATO-made heavy artillery, and motorized transports have been torn apart by kamikaze drones and land mines. That led to individual soldiers trying to rush across no-man's land on foot, but drones made short work of them. What's left to try but returning to the 19th century?\n\nIn strict military terms, what the Russians are deploying are probably closer to dragoons than proper cavalry. As with earlier ATV assaults, this is just old-fashioned Russian infantry using a vehicle to move around quickly before jumping off and fighting on foot. It speaks volumes that they've gotten to this point: the invaders must be desperate for spare parts, forcing them to turn to animals. That's an indicator of general economic deterioration. However, as the Telegraph points out, horses are not made of metal, a tactical advantage against magnetic land mines.\n\nThat's not to say these horses aren't hi-tech! The Russians have outfitted their horses with Starlink terminals, and yes that is also a real sentence. The Kyiv Post reports soldiers throwing a rig together, including a dish and a console. As the article notes, SpaceX is supposedly not doing business with Russia, but workarounds grant the soldiers access. Russian military expert Samuel Bendett told Forbes that this all looks like ad hoc improvisation by individual units in the field, rather than a coordinated doctrine from Moscow.\n\nhttps://t.co/BeT9UQpCRopic.twitter.com/626A5HNKfM\n\n— OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) December 26, 2025\n\nAs always, the actual horses don't have much say in the matter and don't know what's going on. The Ukrainians apparently didn't want to kill the quadrupedal conscripts, which required a change in tactics. Normally, the kamikaze drones would just dive-bomb the soldier on the vehicle, taking out both. To save the poor horse, operators now buzz the equine to spook it, throwing off the rider. The drone the circles back to strike the dismounted soldier. That's battlefield empathy for you. The video above shows an example.\n\nThe whole thing is an example of opposing forces experimenting and adapting to one another, something that Russia and Ukraine have been doing since the invasion began. Drone warfare in particular is being tested in this war, with new tactics popping up all the time. The U.S. military has taken note and is actively trying to pivot to smaller, cheaper platforms itself. As the world adapts to this new form of conflict, expect more innovations and counter-innovations to appear, both in technology and doctrine. Even satellite-equipped dragoons, apparently. When the infantry starts forming squares, you know it's getting dire.\n\nWant more like this?

    "fullText": "Russia said Friday it used its latest missile against Ukraine for a second time in the nearly 4-year-old war, a forceful signal to Kyiv and its Western allies as U.S.-led peace talks have entered a new and crucial stage.\n\nThe hypersonic Oreshnik intermediate range ballistic missile hit Ukraine's western Lviv region late Thursday night, although officials there did not mention any casualties. The area is near a military base in neighboring Poland, a NATO member, that serves as a key hub for ferrying Western military supplies to Kyiv.\n\nSome Moscow commentators said the attack was a warning to European leaders against proposals to deploy their troops to Ukraine as part of a prospective peace deal. Russia has said it won't accept such a deployment and would view those forces as legitimate targets.\n\nA look at the weapon and why Russia used it now:\n\nWhat’s known about the Oreshnik\n\nRussia first used the multiple-warhead Oreshnik on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro in November 2024.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin said the Oreshnik, which means “hazelnut tree” in Russian, streaks at 10 times the speed of sound, or Mach 10, “like a meteorite,” and was immune to any missile defense system.\n\nHe said the weapon is so powerful that several such missiles -- even fitted with conventional warheads — could be as devastating as a nuclear strike. He said it’s capable of destroying underground bunkers “three, four or more floors down.”\n\nThe Russian military said the Oreshnik can carry nuclear or conventional warheads and can reach any European target.\n\nThe Pentagon said the Oreshnik was an experimental type of intermediate-range ballistic missile, or IRBM, based on Russia’s RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. Intermediate-range missiles can fly between 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,400 miles). Such weapons were banned under a Soviet-era treaty that Washington and Moscow abandoned in 2019.\n\nWhen Russia first used the Oreshnik, Ukraine’s military said the missile had six independently targetable warheads, each carrying six submunitions.\n\nRussian military bloggers said the submunitions released by each warhead apparently were unarmed but had high kinetic energy estimated to deliver a destructive force equivalent to tons of explosives.\n\nSince the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia has used swarms of cheap slow-flying drones and an assortment of other missiles, but none had the range and power of Oreshnik.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said last month the Oreshnik had been deployed to Belarus and entered active service. It didn't specify how many missiles were sent to the key ally of Moscow and whether they were fitted with nuclear warheads, but Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that up to 10 Oreshnik systems will be stationed there.\n\nRussia previously has stationed tactical nuclear weapons inside Belarus, whose territory it used to launch the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn 2024, Putin released a revised nuclear doctrine that placed Belarus under Russia's atomic umbrella. The document significantly lowered the threshold for the possible use of nuclear weapons, declaring that any nation’s conventional attack on Russia that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack on the country. The threat was clearly aimed at discouraging the West from allowing Ukraine to strike Russia with longer-range weapons.\n\nUnlike Russia's other shorter-range conventional weapons, the Oreshnik is able to launch a powerful, conventional strike anywhere in Europe, giving the Kremlin a new instrument of escalation without tapping its nuclear arsenal. There will be no way to know whether the missile is carrying a nuclear or a conventional warhead before it hits the target.\n\nRussia's message by using the Oreshnik\n\nWhen Russia first used the Oreshnik, Putin described it as a response to Ukraine's Western allies allowing it to use their longer-range weapons to strike Russian territory.\n\nIts latest strike comes as the U.S.-led efforts to end the war in Ukraine have entered a pivotal stage and appears to underline Putin’s intention to negotiate from a position of strength as his troops make slow but steady territorial gains.\n\nSome Russian military bloggers noted that the strike in Lviv, not far from the Polish border, was a message intended for Kyiv’s allies. Those members of the “coalition of the willing” have proposed sending their troops to Ukraine as part of security guarantees once a peace deal is reached.\n\nRussia has said it won't accept any European forces in Ukraine, seeing them as legitimate targets.\n\n“For the first time, NATO command has been shown a strategic weapons strike virtually on its border,” said military expert Valery Shiryayev. “This action is intended to demonstrate the determination of Russia’s military and political leadership to use such weapons with nuclear warheads if necessary.”\n\nThe attack comes less than a week after the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a Russian ally. The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced the U.S. action as an act of aggression and sharply criticized Wednesday’s U.S. seizure of a Russia-flagged tanker.",

    "description": "The Ukranian military has relied heavily on Starlink satellites for communications since Russia invaded in 2022, but this response seems implausible.",
    "fullText": "Even if you've never used the service you're likely familiar with Starlink, the global internet service provider that depends on an array of satellites in low-earth orbit (LEO). SpaceX launched the first Starlink satellites in 2019, and since them more than 9,000 more have joined those initial five dozen. Starlink plans an eventual fleet of over 40,000, but before that can happen Russia seems interested in knocking some of them out of commission.\n\nIn late December of 2025 the Associated Press reported that \"Two NATO-nation intelligence services suspect Russia is developing a new anti-satellite weapon to target Elon Musk's Starlink constellation.\" The unnamed services apparently said Russia wouldn't target satellites individually or with electromagnetic pulse devices but rather employ a \"zone-effect\" weapon consisting of a cloud of dense pellets. While any unsourced reports should be taken lightly, potential Russian interest in taking out Starlink satellites could be due to Ukraine's dependence on Starlink since Russia invaded in 2022. While anti-satellite weapons aren't new, they present significant risk in the form of widespread debris fields that could threaten other satellites.\n\nA \"zone effect\" weapon like the one mentioned is akin to firing a shotgun blast at the satellites, with one major difference. While shotgun pellets are limited by physics and gravity to a few seconds of flight, debris in space continues zipping around until it hits something or is captured by the earth's gravity field. The AP quoted defense expert Victoria Samson of the Secure World Foundation as saying \"I would be very surprised, frankly, if they were to do something like that.\" Brigadier General Christopher Horner — who commands the Space division of the Canadian military — wasn't so sure. After confirming that his intelligence services hadn't turned up any evidence of such a weapon, he added the caveat \"it's not implausible.\"\n\nStarlink satellites travel at 27,000 km/h (almost 17,000 mph) and orbit at 550 km (341.75 miles) above the earth. Hitting even a small object at that speed can cause catastrophic damage to the delicate structures and instruments on a satellite, and Starlink's aren't the only ones in low-earth orbit.\n\nNASA defines low-earth orbit as below 1,200 miles, noting that the International Space Station occupies this level of space and that it plans to expand access to \"include government agencies, commercial providers, academic organizations, and potentially more.\"\n\nDepoloying a \"zone-effect\" weapon like the one described in Associated Press' reporting would certainly cause indiscriminate damage to these satellites. The potential risks would be obvious to any rogue state on the planet, and Russia surely has scientists who understand them. Even if Russia never plans on developing or using such a device, it's possible this story has been fabricated and leaked to deter Starlink's operational support of Ukraine. Starlink is also providing internet service in Venezuela after U.S. military operations there, although that's only through February 3.\n\nZone-effect weapons are relatively low-tech, and Russia has a dedicated space launch agency with the ability to deploy much more capable anti-satellite weapons. Among the most powerful military air defense systems in the world is Russia's S-500 Prometheus, which can take out satellites in the near reaches of low-earth orbit. The S-500 was engineered as a defensive weapon, but it's not a huge leap in logic to imagine it being used in a \"zone effect\" or other attack on Starlink satellites.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin's launch of an Oreshnik hypersonic missile appears aimed at intimidating Ukraine and sending a signal of Russian military might to Europe and the United States at a crucial juncture in talks to end the war.\n\nPutin has repeatedly boasted of the speed and destructive power of the Oreshnik, which ​Russia first fired at Ukraine in November 2024. Since then, it has kept the weapon in reserve.\n\nThe overnight Oreshnik strike in western Ukraine came after a week of setbacks for Russia. ‌On Saturday, President Donald Trump sent U.S. special forces to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a close Putin ally, and on Wednesday U.S. forces seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the north Atlantic.\n\nOn Tuesday, Britain and France announced plans to deploy troops in Ukraine ‌in the event of a ceasefire - prompting Moscow to respond that it would view foreign soldiers as legitimate combat targets.\n\nGerhard Mangott, a Russia specialist at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, said Moscow was frustrated at being sidelined during weeks of diplomacy between the U.S., Ukraine and the Europeans, and \"particularly mad\" about the planned potential troop deployment by Kyiv's European allies. The use of the Oreshnik should be seen in that context, he said.\n\n\"It's a signal to the United States and the Europeans about the military capabilities of the Russian army,\" Mangott said in a telephone interview.\n\nHe said Moscow wanted to convey that \"Russia is to be taken seriously, given its military arsenal, ⁠and that the Europeans and Trump should return to a minimum of respect ‌for the Russian position in the negotiations.\"\n\n'DESTRUCTION NOT NECESSARILY THE GOAL'\n\nThe Oreshnik is capable of carrying nuclear as well as conventional warheads, although there was no suggestion of any nuclear component to the latest attack.\n\nA senior Ukrainian official told Reuters that the missile struck a state enterprise in the western city of Lviv and ‍was likely carrying inert or \"dummy\" warheads - as in 2024, when Russia first fired it to test the weapon in war.\n\n\"It does appear that at this point Russia is using Oreshnik for signaling purposes, so the destruction is not necessarily the goal,\" Pavel Podvig, director of the Russian Nuclear Forces Project, told Reuters when asked if the use of dummy warheads would diminish the capacity of Moscow's action to intimidate Ukraine and its allies.\n\n\"It's probably a general signal of resolve ​to escalate. My guess is that it will be read this way by the West,\" he said.\n\nWestern reaction to the attack, around 60 km (40 miles) from Ukraine's border with NATO member Poland, was swift. ‌The leaders of Britain, France and Germany called it \"escalatory and unacceptable\". European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said it was \"a clear escalation against Ukraine and meant as a warning to Europe and to the U.S.\".\n\nRUSSIAN STATEMENT ON REASON FOR MISSILE USE DRAWS SCEPTICISM\n\nRussia specialist Mangott was sceptical about the official statement from Russia's Defence Ministry that the Oreshnik launch was in response to an alleged Ukraine drone strike targeting one of Putin's residences, in the northern region of Novgorod, late last month. Ukraine has denied any such attack took place, accusing Moscow of lying about it in order to derail peace talks.\n\nSeveral high-profile Russian war bloggers also criticised the official framing of the strike as a revenge attack. One, Yuri Baranchik, suggested it would have \"looked more convincing\" if Moscow had fired the missile at President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's bunker in Kyiv.\n\nMick Ryan, ⁠an Australian military expert, linked the weapon's use to Russia's recent setbacks, especially over Venezuela.\n\nHe said the point was \"to demonstrate ​that Russia remains a nuclear-armed world power. In this guise, it is a psychological weapon – an instrument of Putin’s cognitive war ​against Ukraine and the West – rather than a weapon of mass physical destruction.\"\n\nRussian arch-hawk Dmitry Medvedev, a former president who is now deputy chairman of Putin's Security Council, alluded in a social media post to the capture of Maduro, the oil tanker seizure by the U.S. and the possibility of further U.S. sanctions against Russia, which he ‍said had made for a \"stormy\" start to the year.\n\nIn ⁠comments highly critical of Washington, he said international relations had descended into a madhouse and compared the Oreshnik strike to \"a life-saving injection of haloperidol\", an anti-psychotic drug.\n\nProminent Russian war blogger Fighterbomber, a former military serviceman, said he thought the use of the Oreshnik was a display of power to convey a message and that Moscow would not be resorting to it often.\n\nHe noted that ⁠some Oreshnik systems had been transferred to Belarus and that Russia would have some of its own in reserve, but suggested that there was not an endless supply of the relatively new missile.\n\n\"Taking all these constants into account, we can assume that ‌we can afford to conduct such demonstrations two or three times a year,\" he wrote.\n\nHe expressed hope that no further launches would be needed for now, concluding: \"The signals have ‌been sent and they have been heard.\"",

    "description": "France's defense ministry picked Mistral to supply military AI systems running on national infrastructure, demonstrating Europe's push for tech sovereignty.",
    "fullText": "French AI startup Mistral has secured a major vote of confidence from its home government after landing a deal to provide AI technology to France's military.\n\nFrance's Ministry of the Armed Forces said on Thursday that it has formally notified a framework agreement with Mistral AI, giving the country's armed forces, defense agencies, and affiliated public institutions access to the company's advanced AI models, software, and services.\n\nUnder the deal overseen by the ministry's defense AI agency, Mistral's AI systems will be deployed on French-controlled infrastructure, a key priority for the military as governments grow increasingly cautious about where sensitive data is processed and which laws govern it.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post announcing the deal, Mistral said its AI systems would be deployed on France's own infrastructure and fine-tuned using defense-specific data to support operational military needs.\n\nThe financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed. Mistral was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Business Insider.\n\nThe agreement marks a significant win for Mistral, which was founded in 2023 and is valued at roughly $13.6 billion, following a 1.7 billion euro ($2 billion) funding round announced last year.\n\nThe startup has positioned itself as a European alternative to US AI heavyweights, such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, pitching its models as powerful yet more compatible with Europe's sovereignty and data control ambitions.\n\nIn its statement, translated by Business Insider, the defense ministry said the partnership is intended to strengthen France's \"technological sovereignty\" and ensure the armed forces maintain control over critical AI tools used across military operations and administration.\n\nBertrand Rondepierre, director of the ministry's defense AI agency, said the agreement represents \"a major step\" in strengthening the ministry's generative AI capabilities and preparing the armed forces for future challenges, while maintaining sovereign control over the technologies used.\n\nThe deal comes as European governments reassess their dependence on US technology in strategic sectors ranging from cloud computing to semiconductors and now AI.\n\nThe French ministry's move mirrors that of the US government, which has increasingly inked major contracts with domestic AI companies to develop tools for military and national security use, including recent deals with OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, and other defense-focused startups.\n\nAs generative AI becomes increasingly embedded in military planning, logistics, and analysis, Mistral's latest win helps to position the startup as one of Europe's key players in the race to develop sovereign alternatives to American tech giants.\n\nDo you work for Mistral and have a tip or story to share?

    "title": "The US military's annual suicide report is missing, and the Pentagon isn't offering any answers",
    "description": "Pentagon reporting on military suicide rates is usually released each fall. Right now, it remains unpublished, with no explanation.",
    "fullText": "A critical data source for US military suicide prevention efforts is late.\n\nThe annual suicide report, which the Department of Defense typically publishes each fall, provides suicide statistics from the previous calendar year that inform Congress, researchers, and senior leaders across the services on efforts to combat military suicide, a persistent problem.\n\nThe defense department is also delayed in releasing its quarterly suicide data for 2025, with the third-quarter figures still unpublished, months later than usual.\n\nBusiness Insider queried the Pentagon in mid-December about the anticipated release date of the annual report.\n\n\"The Department has nothing to announce at this time,\" a department spokesperson replied in an email. \"We will follow up if anything changes.\" When asked again this week why the report is delayed and when it might be published, the Pentagon did not respond.\n\nBusiness Insider sent a separate email query to the Defense Suicide Prevention Office, which releases the report. The office did not respond.\n\nIt is unclear whether the delay is tied to the government shutdown.\n\nThough the data is beneficial, the monthslong delay is unlikely to significantly affect research or prevention efforts, said Ron Kessler, a principal investigator on a long-term Army suicide study and a professor of healthcare policy at Harvard Medical School. He said researchers depend more frequently on detailed data that reveals patterns and circumstances around deaths.\n\nThe bigger issue is tied to accountability, public transparency, and oversight, he said.\n\n\"Publishing is letting the outside world know what's going on,\" Keller said. \"And that's useful for holding organizations accountable.\"\n\nThe Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs have each tried to improve suicide prevention efforts, Kessler said, highlighting a project he's involved in that's testing whether artificial intelligence can effectively identify people at risk of suicide. The annual reports reveal the level of progress and show where further work is needed.\n\n\"It's important for the data to be out there,\" Kessler added, \"not to ever be to a point where we say what's not being shown anymore. It's good for the public to be able to say, 'Is the military doing a good job? What's going on?'\"\n\nSuicide deaths among service members rose during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the most recent publicly available data — from calendar year 2023 — showed a small increase over the year prior. According to the Defense Suicide Prevention Office, military suicide deaths have increased gradually since 2011.\n\nThe 2023 report showed that young enlisted men accounted for the largest share of suicide deaths in the US military. That mirrors broader national trends. American men are nearly four times more likely to die by suicide than women, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.\n\nFirearms were involved in roughly half of all US suicide deaths in 2023, and previous military reports have repeatedly identified access to firearms as a risk factor, particularly for younger enlisted personnel.\n\nSome military leaders recently emphasized suicide prevention needs during the holiday season. In November, Army Secretary Dan Driscoll directed supervisors across the Army to conduct daily check-ins with their subordinates through mid-January.\n\nThough the initiative was initially lauded, some supervisors and troops online have described the mandatory directive as unintentionally burdensome.\n\nThe broader Pentagon reporting delays coincide with certain organizational changes inside the Army. A September Army memo highlighted plans to disband its directorate responsible for overseeing soldier quality-of-life issues, known as a G-9, citing \"administrative convenience.\" The responsibilities of that office have since been folded into the service's human resources directorate.\n\nArmy spokeswoman Heather J. Hagan confirmed the change to Business Insider on Thursday, adding that the service remains committed to troop and family quality of life.\n\nIt is unclear how the change may affect oversight of soldier well-being or how suicide prevention priorities are being evaluated, as the Pentagon's annual suicide data remains unpublished.",

    "title": "The military is running out of teenagers to recruit — and old-school methods to reach them are failing",
    "description": "The military faces a new recruiting crisis as America's teen population shrinks and outreach methods fail. The Pentagon is rethinking its playbook.",
    "fullText": "Military recruiting is on the upswing, but many recruiters say it's never been harder to get young people interested in service.\n\nPhone lists of numbers that once rang a family landline now dead-end at parents' cellphones. School access can vary from one street to the next. And while a direct message might be the fastest way to reach an overly online 17-year-old, finding the right social media handle can feel like chasing ghosts. The hunt has become so grueling that the time it takes to meet quotas of up to two recruits a month is pushing some recruiters into burnout territory.\n\nThese are some of the frustrations Business Insider heard while speaking to nearly four dozen Marine recruiters, leaders, and other officials for a four-part series on recruiter welfare.\n\nThe hunt for solutions is on, and legislation and use of artificial intelligence could be on the horizon.\n\nThe Pentagon is facing steep declines in young Americans' propensity and fitness to serve and public confidence in the military, long one of the government's most-trusted institutions, according to public polling.\n\nBoosting young Americans' interest in service, and reaching them in the first place, will require more than traditional military recruiting efforts, those involved agree. Political momentum for broader measures is already building.\n\nProject 2025, the conservative policy blueprint, outlines a major expansion of recruiting in schools: increased access for recruiters, more Junior ROTC programs, and a requirement that federally funded schools administer the military entrance exam. An effort to provide recruiters with improved access to high schools was included in the national defense spending bill signed into law in December.\n\nThe office of the defense secretary, which did not respond to a request for comment, recently established a new Recruitment Task Force. The Corps' Recruiting Command, which is part of the task force, is seeking legislative changes to help \"improve the student data collected in support of recruiting,\" a Marine spokesman told Business Insider.\n\nExperts are pressing for urgent solutions as population shifts reduce pools of young people eligible for the military.\n\n\"The coming declining birth rate challenge is so pronounced, even if the services were doing everything right to get to our current requirements, the math is just going to change,\" said Kate Kuzminski, the director of studies at the Center for a New American Security and author of a recent report on recruiting.\n\nOver the next 16 years, the total number of children turning 18 is expected to fall by 700,000, representing a 13% drop, according to Kuzminski's research.\n\n\"Recruiters' jobs are going to be made a lot more difficult by this generational decline,\" Kuzminski said. Soon, they'll be forced to contend with capturing a larger percentage of American youth than ever before to meet the same end-strength requirements.\n\nAs recruiting pools narrow, the Army and Navy have found a way to turn otherwise unqualified young people into fit recruits, with new pre-boot camp preparatory courses to help applicants raise test scores or lose weight to meet military fitness standards.\n\nThe approach has helped dramatically boost enlistments. But the effort has drawn scrutiny over whether those services are accepting too many low-scoring applicants.\n\n\"The things that have worked up until now are not going to work in the future,\" Kuzminski said of recruiting.\n\nFor now, Marines still find new recruits by canvassing malls, attending community events, visiting schools, messaging social media accounts, and making dozens of phone calls that often reach a parent who isn't thrilled about the idea of their child joining the military.\n\nHigh schools that receive federal funding are legally required to allow recruiters access to grounds for pitches to classrooms or career fairs. But several recruiters said access isn't uniformly offered, and can hinge on the relationships recruiters foster with educators.\n\nA Marine recruiting official said geography can play a role and that some areas in the Northeast are known for more regularly keeping out recruiters.\n\nMore than half a dozen recruiters said conservative or rural areas aren't necessarily more welcoming, either. In their view, new enlistees are rarely motivated by politics; they're drawn by purpose, belonging, and the promise of financial stability.\n\nEven in places where \"support the troops\" is a common refrain, recruiters said, many parents resist the idea of their children joining the military.\n\nAnother factor: With fewer Americans personally connected to the armed forces, interest in enlisting has waned. A dwindling veteran population means fewer role models to inspire the next generation, and after two decades of the Global War on Terror, some veterans discourage their own children from serving.\n\nRecruiters say this reflects a growing divide between the military and civilian America — and a misunderstanding of what daily military life can entail — not just heroic Navy SEALs, or Top Gun pilots, but also equipment maintenance, human resources management, and mundane planning for those holding senior ranks.\n\nThe result of this divide, recruiters said, isn't just apathy. Three recruiters told Business Insider they've had guns pulled on them when visiting homes. One, who remains on active duty, recalled being called a \"baby killer\" and a \"slave\" to the government by an irate parent.\n\nAs phone lists falter and school access remains inconsistent — problems compounded by falling US birth rates and shrinking pools of potential recruits — recruiters are trying to meet teens where they already are: online. Social media has become a routine part of the job; artificial intelligence, meanwhile, is only beginning to surface as a potential tool.\n\nMany recruiters already use social media to connect with young people, though with varying results. Earlier this year, the Army tried partnering with influencers already in uniform to pique interest in enlistment, an effort that was halted after running into legal hurdles.\n\nWhen it comes to contacting prospective recruits through social media, some recruiters say it can feel inappropriate, acutely aware of past misconduct cases and wary of how easily online interactions can blur boundaries.\n\nAt the same time, the military's ties with Big Tech are deepening and opening new doors. A handful of leaders from Silicon Valley, including executives from Palantir, Meta, and OpenAI, were commissioned into the US Army Reserve earlier this year. It's part of a larger Army transformation effort to prepare the service for future conflicts, which some defense experts have said will require help from Silicon Valley.\n\nIn building the manpower for the future fight, leaning on emerging technology and, particularly, artificial intelligence could help recruiters identify and contact young people who may be predisposed to service, such as athletes, gamers, or those interested in science, technology, engineering, and math fields, said retired Marine Col. Bill Gray, who led recruiting efforts across the Southeast from 2018 to 2021.\n\nRecruiting has long been one of the military's toughest jobs, and when it tanks, Gray said, the answer has long been to expect recruiters to work harder, an idea that he said feels out of date with emerging technologies.\n\nOne fix, he said, could be giving recruiters access to contact information that's publicly available but not easily accessible. He recalled once watching recruiters flip through physical copies of high school yearbooks to zero in on star athletes and other standout students, a time-suck.\n\n\"It's mind-boggling to me that we are even having this conversation because of the time that could be saved,\" he said. \"You could be processing at machine speed instead of one-human speed.\"\n\nWithout a draft, increased face time with prospective recruits would be critical if the nation were to enter a large-scale war, said one senior Marine official familiar with recruiting demands who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nWhile AI tools have the potential to make connecting with recruits easier, the official said that effort could run up against federal laws restricting the military's ability to collect or analyze data about US citizens.\n\n\"We are recruiting children,\" the official said. \"It's good that it's hard for our recruiters to find children who want to join. It should not be easy.\"\n\n\"There's a reluctance to go down some of these paths,\" Gray, the retired colonel, said. \"People say, 'Well, we're making mission, so if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" Some recruiters say the system is breaking them — putting them under stress and threatening to derail their military careers.\n\n\"You could make life so much easier for those guys and gals,\" Gray said.",

    "fullText": "The \"TACO trade,\" short for Trump Always Chickens Out, was one of the great market memes of 2025. Whenever the market would throw a tantrum about a Trump policy — usually related to tariffs — the president would reverse course to stem the bleeding.\n\nA similar story has played out this week within US defense stocks, with a few unique twists. Here's the minute-by-minute recap from Wednesday afternoon:\n\nIt was that last statement, 2 hours and 9 minutes after Trump's first post about defense companies, that sparked a rally in those exact same defense stocks on Thursday. The optimism of a huge spending increase had offset the initial sting of industry criticism.\n\nIt wasn't a precise TACO trade situation. It was closer to something I'd like to coin as the TUNA trade: Trump Usually Negates Announcements. The president didn't outright reverse a prior statement. He countered a bearish opinion with something bullish that counterbalanced it. There's a big difference!\n\nThe volatile episode leaves questions unanswered about the future of the industry. The knee-jerk reaction from investors was to buy/sell first, then ask questions later. What does the longer term look like?\n\nWall Street analysts generally support the idea that the additional military spending will offset any new capital restrictions.\n\n\"The changes are significant but not necessarily draconian,\" said JPMorgan analyst Seth Seifman. A \"potential budget increase would support sustained growth, taking some sting out of the executive order.\"\n\nKen Herbert, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, says large-cap defense companies will feel the squeeze more than their defense-tech counterparts, which he sees outperforming.\n\n\"Defense primes will look to de-risk major program investments by securing long-term purchase agreements, where possible,\" he added.\n\nJefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu called Trump's comments an \"overreach\" and said that they catalyzed something that was already bound to happen.\n\n\"The industry has been clear that it is ready to invest on clearer demand signals,\" she said.\n\nFrom a demand perspective, $1.5 trillion in 2027 sounds quite appealing. If all goes according to plan — and that's a big \"if\" — more stock gains could be in store for defense companies.",

The effort to disarm Hezbollah comes after a Washington-brokered ceasefire ended a war between the group and Israel in 2024.",
    "fullText": "BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon's military said Thursday it had concluded the first phase of a plan to fully deploy across southern Lebanon and disarm non-state groups, notably Hezbollah.\n\nIsrael said the development was encouraging but “far from sufficient,\" and its Foreign Ministry said the group still has dozens of compounds and other infrastructure.\n\nThe effort to disarm Hezbollah comes after a Washington-brokered ceasefire ended a war between the group and Israel in 2024.\n\nThe military's statement, which did not name Hezbollah or any other armed groups, came before President Joseph Aoun met with Prime Minister Nawaf Salam and his government to discuss the deployment and disarmament plans. Both said disarming non-state groups was a priority upon beginning their terms not long after the ceasefire went into effect.\n\nLebanon's top officials have endorsed the military announcement.\n\nA statement by Aoun’s office ahead of the Cabinet meeting called on Israel to stop its attacks, withdraw from areas it occupies, and release Lebanese prisoners. He called on friendly countries not to send weapons to Lebanon unless it's to state institutions — an apparent reference to Iran which for decades has sent weapons and munitions to Hezbollah.\n\nSpeaker Nabih Berri, a key ally of Hezbollah who played a leading role in ceasefire talks, issued a statement saying the people of southern Lebanon are “thirsty for the army's presence and protection.\"\n\nIsrael maintains that despite Lebanon’s efforts, Hezbollah is still attempting to rearm itself in southern Lebanon.\n\n“The ceasefire agreement brokered by the United States between Israel and Lebanon states clearly, Hezbollah must be fully disarmed,\" a statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office read. “This is imperative for Israel’s security and Lebanon’s future.”\n\nIsrael's Foreign Ministry said in a later statement that the group is “rearming faster than it is being disarmed,\" and showed a map of alleged Hezbollah compounds, launch sites, and underground networks south of the Litani River.\n\nPlan to restrict weapons at an ‘advanced stage’\n\nThe text of the ceasefire agreement is vague as to how Hezbollah’s weapons and military facilities north of the Litani River should be treated, saying Lebanese authorities should dismantle unauthorized facilities starting with the area south of the river.\n\nHezbollah insists that the agreement only applies south of the Litani, while Israel maintains that it applies to the whole country. The Lebanese government has said it will eventually remove non-state weapons throughout the country.\n\nThe agreement is seen as a procedure to implement prior United Nations Security Council agreements that call for disarmament of non-state groups and the withdrawal of all occupying forces, and for the Lebanese state to have full control of its territory.\n\nInformation Minister Paul Morcos said after the Cabinet meeting that the army will start working on a plan for disarmament north of the Litani river that will be discussed by the government in February. He added that the army will also continue the process of weapons “containment” in other parts of Lebanon, meaning that they will not be allowed to be used or moved.\n\nThe Lebanese military has been clearing tunnels, rocket-launching positions, and other structures since its disarmament proposal was approved by the government and went into effect in September.\n\nThe government had set a deadline of the end of 2025 to clear the area south of the Litani River of non-state weapons.\n\n“The army confirms that its plan to restrict weapons has entered an advanced stage, after achieving the goals of the first phase effectively and tangibly on the ground,” the military statement read. “Work in the sector is ongoing until the unexploded ordnance and tunnels are cleared ... with the aim of preventing armed groups from irreversibly rebuilding their capabilities.”\n\nHezbollah did not immediately comment on the Lebanese announcement.\n\nOfficials have said the next stage of the disarmament plan is in segments of southern Lebanon between the Litani and the Awali rivers, which include Lebanon’s port city of Sidon, but they have not set a timeline for that phase.\n\nIsrael continues to strike Lebanon near daily and occupies five strategic hilltop points along the border, the only areas south of the Litani where the military said it has yet to control.\n\nRegular meetings have taken place between the Lebanese and the Israelis alongside the United States, France, and the U.N. peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, to monitor developments after the ceasefire.\n\nLebanon’s cash-strapped military has since been gradually dispersing across wide areas of southern Lebanon between the Litani and the U.N.-demarcated “Blue Line” that separates the tiny country from Israel. The military has also been slowly confiscating weapons from armed Palestinian factions in refugee camps.\n\nIsrael accuses Hezbollah of trying to rebuild its battered military capacity and has said that the Lebanese military’s efforts are not sufficient, raising fears of a new escalation. Lebanon, meanwhile, said Israel's strikes and control of the hilltops were an obstacle to the efforts.\n\nLebanon also hopes that disarming Hezbollah and other non-state groups will help to bring in money needed for reconstruction after the 2024 war.\n\nHezbollah says it has been cooperative with the army in the south but will not discuss disarming elsewhere before Israel stops its strikes and withdraws from Lebanese territory.\n\nThe latest Israel-Hezbollah conflict began the day after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel triggered the war in Gaza. The militant group Hezbollah, largely based in southern Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel in support of Hamas and the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael responded with airstrikes and shelling. The low-level conflict escalated into full-scale war in September 2024. Israeli strikes killed much of Hezbollah's senior leadership and left the group severely weakened.\n\nHezbollah still has political clout, holding a large number of seats in parliament representing the Shiite Muslim community and two cabinet ministers.",

    "fullText": "The federal agent who shot and killed a driver in Minneapolis is an Iraq War veteran who has served for nearly two decades in the Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to records obtained Thursday by The Associated Press.\n\nJonathan Ross, who shot and killed Renee Good on Wednesday, has served as a deportation officer with ICE since 2015, records show. He was seriously injured last summer when he was dragged by the vehicle of a fleeing suspect whom he shot with a stun gun.\n\nFederal officials have not named the officer who shot Good, a 37-year-old mother who was shot as she tried to drive away from federal agents. But Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem said the agent who shot Good had been dragged by a vehicle last June, and a department spokesperson confirmed Noem was referring to the Bloomington, Minnesota, case in which documents identified the injured officer as Ross.\n\nNoem and other Trump administration officials have defended the agent as an experienced law enforcement professional who followed his training and shot Good after he believed she was trying to run him or other agents over with her vehicle. Video has raised questions about whether the shooting was in self-defense, and the FBI is investigating the deadly use of force. Some protesters are demanding that Ross face criminal charges, and Minnesota authorities also want to investigate.\n\nAttempts to reach Ross, 43, at phone numbers and email addresses associated with him were not immediately successful.\n\nHere are some things to know about him:\n\nExperienced military and law enforcement officer\n\nIn courtroom testimony last month, Ross said he deployed to Iraq from 2004 to 2005 with the Indiana National Guard. Ross said he served as a machine gunner on a gun truck as part of a combat patrol team.\n\nHe said he returned from Iraq in 2005, went to college and joined the Border Patrol in 2007 near El Paso, Texas. He worked there until 2015, serving as a field intelligence agent gathering and analyzing information on cartels and drug and human smuggling.\n\nRoss said he has served as a deportation officer based in Minnesota since he joined ICE in 2015. He is assigned to fugitive operations, seeking to arrest “higher value targets” in the ICE region that includes Minneapolis, he testified last month. He said that he was also a team leader with the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force.\n\n“So I develop the targets, create a target package, surveillance, and then develop a plan to execute the arrest warrant,” he said.\n\nRoss said that he was also a firearms instructor, an active shooter instructor, a field intelligence officer and member of the SWAT team. He said that he attended the Border Patrol’s academy in New Mexico, where he learned to speak Spanish.\n\nRoss was a leader of a team of agents who went to arrest a man who was in the U.S. illegally in the Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington on June 17. Agents had gathered outside the home of the man, Roberto Munoz-Guatemala, who left in his car, according to court records.\n\nFBI agents activated emergency sirens and lights instructing him to pull over but he did not. Ross pulled his vehicle diagonally in front of Munoz-Guatemala to force him to stop.\n\nRoss and an FBI agent identified themselves as police and pointed guns at Munoz-Guatemala, who raised his hands. Ross then approached Munoz-Guatemala’s vehicle and ordered him to put it in park.\n\nRoss told the driver to lower his window all the way down and warned that he would break it if he did not. Ross used a device known as a “spring-loaded window punch” to break the rear driver’s side window and reached inside the car to unlock the driver’s door.\n\nMunoz-Guatemela drove off while Ross’ arm was caught in the vehicle and accelerated, dragging Ross down the street. Ross fired his Taser, striking Munoz-Guatemala with prongs in the head, face and shoulder.\n\nMunoz-Guatemela was not incapacitated by the Taser, prosecutors said, and kept driving, taking Ross the length of a football field in 12 seconds. Ross was knocked free from the vehicle by force after Munoz-Guatemala drove onto a curb for a second time and back to the street.\n\nRoss’ right arm was bleeding, and an FBI agent applied a tourniquet. Eventually, he received dozens of stitches at a hospital. Prosecutors said he had “suffered multiple large cuts, and abrasions to his knee, elbow, and face.”\n\n“It was pretty excruciating pain,” Ross testified.\n\nMunoz-Guatemela was bleeding from his injuries and had a woman call 911, saying that he was assaulted and didn’t know whether the person trying to stop him was an officer. He was arrested and charged with assault on a federal officer with a dangerous or deadly weapon.\n\nA jury found Munoz-Guatemala guilty at a trial last month, finding he “should reasonably have known that Jonathan Ross was a law enforcement officer and not a private citizen attempting to assault him.”\n\nFederal officials defend the agent without identifying him\n\nVice President J.D. Vance praised the agent's service to the country Thursday without naming him, saying the ICE officer “deserves a debt of gratitude.”\n\n“This is a guy who’s actually done a very, very important job for the United States of America,” Vance said. “He’s been assaulted. He’s been attacked. He’s been injured because of it.”\n\nDHS assistant Tricia McLaughlin declined to confirm the agent's identity Thursday, saying doing so would be dangerous for the safety of him and his family. But she noted that he had been selected for ICE’s special response team, which includes a 30-hour tryout and additional training on specialized skills such as breaching techniques, perimeter control, hostage rescue and firearms.\n\n“He acted according to his training,” she said. “This officer is a longtime ICE officer who has been serving his country his entire life.”",

    "description": "The president doubled down on his plans to take military action in Latin America, annex Greenland and more in a revealing new interview",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said that his only guardrail as he looks to obtain more global power is \"my own morality\"\n\nIn a new interview with The New York Times, he said he doesn't \"need international law\" to dictate his approach to foreign policy\n\nAlso in the interview, the president doubled down on his plans to take military action in Latin America, annex Greenland and more\n\nPresident Donald Trump is making it clear that he won't be constrained by the law as he continues teasing a takeover of the Western Hemisphere.\n\n“I don’t need international law,” Trump said in a new interview with The New York Times. “I’m not looking to hurt people.”\n\nWhen pressed further, the president said he understood that his administration would need to abide by international laws. However, he added, \"It depends what your definition of international law is.\"\n\nThere is, Trump insisted, just \"one thing\" that can curtail his desire for global supremacy: \"My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me.\"\n\nThe interview comes less than a week after U.S. forces, under Trump's direction, captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, first lady Cilia Flores, amid \"large-scale strikes\" on the capital city of Caracas, and brought them to the U.S. to stand trial on multiple charges related to narco terrorism.\n\nThough Venezuela has installed an interim leader, Delcy Rodríguez, Trump has stated many times that the United States is now in charge of running the independent nation.\n\n\"It's going to be run very judiciously, very fairly. And it's gonna make a lot of money,\" he previously said. \"You know they stole our oil. We built that whole industry and they just took it over like we were nothing. So we did something about it. We're late, but we did something about it.\"\n\nHe later added, \"We'll be selling large amounts of oil [from Venezuela] to other countries... We're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be.\"\n\n\"We're gonna make sure the people of Venezuela are taken care of... You're going to have peace, justice...you're going to have a real country.\"\n\nHe doesn't plan to stop there. The president is also fixated on his desire to annex Greenland, which is currently controlled by Denmark, a NATO ally of the U.S.\n\nTrump admitted that \"it may be a choice\" to preserve the country's relationship with NATO versus taking over Greenland, an important trade crossroads between the U.S., Europe, China and Russia.\n\n“It’s so strategic right now. Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,” he said to reporters aboard Air Force One on Jan. 4. “We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.”\n\nTo The New York Times, he insisted that it wasn't enough to have the country controlled by an ally — he wants exclusive, outright ownership.\n\n“Because that’s what I feel is psychologically needed for success. I think that ownership gives you a thing that you can’t do with, you’re talking about a lease or a treaty. Ownership gives you things and elements that you can’t get from just signing a document,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump also has his sights set on Colombia, Cuba, Iran and Mexico.\n\n\"You have to do something with Mexico. Mexico has to get their act together because they're pouring through Mexico and we're going to have to do something,\" he previously told reporters, referring to drug cartels in the country.\n\n\"We'd love Mexico to do it. They're capable of doing it, but unfortunately, the cartels are very strong in Mexico,\" Trump added.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nReferring to Colombian President Gustavo Petro, Trump said his country is being \"run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he’s not going to be doing it very long.\"\n\nPetro spoke with the Times prior to calling Trump to discuss the threats, expressing his concern about the U.S. making a strike in Colombia, similar to the one in Venezuela.\n\n“We are in danger,” the Colombian president said. “Because the threat is real. It was made by Trump.”",

    "title": "What Trump's plan to ban defense dividends and raise the military budget could mean for your portfolio",
    "description": "Defense stocks pay relatively high dividends, but there are alternative areas of the market for investors to consider if they want steady income.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump sent defense stocks on a roller coaster ride this week, and his recent executive orders on defense firms and his calls for more defense spending could impact investors' portfolios.\n\nThe president signed an order aimed at restricting some financial behavior among defense contractors, including an executive order that bans defense firms from issuing dividend payments and doing stock buybacks until they deliver a \"superior product.\" Meanwhile, Trump said on Wednesday that he wants the US military budget could raised to a record $1.5 trillion next year.\n\nBoth developments have implications for investors who have money in the defense sector, which is known for paying relatively high dividends. Lockheed Martin, for instance, has an annual dividend yield of around 2%, compared to about 1% for the broader S&P 500.\n\nHere's the rundown of how investors should be thinking about the latest news — and what it means for their portfolios.\n\nFor the most part, investors shouldn't be thinking about their long-term investments too differently. Trump's push to ban dividend payments seems largely hypothetical, and it's unclear how the president will enforce such a rule, said Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.\n\n\"It feels as though this was making another random social media announcement that will likely die on the vine,\" Hogan told Business Insider. \"I don't know you need to make a rush to judgment in terms of changing your long-term investment plans.\"\n\nBesides the threat of barring dividend payments, Trump's announcements on social media seem largely positive for defense investors, José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, said. He added that those who aren't dependent on dividend payments should remain invested in the sector, pointing to the potential for growth.\n\n\"I think that investors can look forward to improved quality from those companies, in the best-case scenario,\" he told BI.\n\nIf defense companies fall in line and pause dividend payments, that could hurt investors who specifically hold dividend-paying stocks for regular income, Torres said.\n\nBut those investors can move to other dividend-paying areas of the market. Torres encouraged investors to consider value sectors with high dividend yields, such as energy and healthcare.\n\nB. Riley's Hogan encouraged investors to consider areas like energy, consumer staples, pharmaceuticals, utilities, and other parts of the industrial sector, a broader umbrella that covers defense stocks.\n\nDividend ETFs, which track a basket of dividend-paying companies, are also an option for investors chasing dividends, he added.\n\n\"There's a lot of dividend darlings for sure,\" Hogan said. \"I think investors, if in fact they feel nervous about the potential for dividend cuts or the removal of dividends in any space, as unlikely as that prospect seems, there are ways to navigate around that.\"\n\nInvestors should be watching their bond investments, Peter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research, said.\n\nBerezin said that the significant increase in defense spending could lead to a rise in bond yields, which would mean bond prices could fall.\n\nInteractive Brokers' Torres also said he believed bond investors should \"absolutely\" be concerned about the more robust military budget, which could raise long-end bond yields in particular.\n\nLong-end bond yields have climbed in recent years as concerns have risen about the US deficit and rising levels of government debt. Higher debt levels make investors more wary of purchasing long-term US Treasurys, which means yields need to rise to attract investors. Heavy borrowing and spending are also inflationary, which could push yields higher down the road as the central bank adjusts monetary policy to keep prices under control.\n\nTorres didn't recommend selling bonds at the moment. He believes concerns around debt have caused long-end bond yields in the US to be \"too high,\" and he expects those yields to ease soon.\n\n\"I'm a bond bull at this juncture,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "The lightning U.S. operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro can be seen as both a benefit and a burden for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose forces botched an attempt to capture Ukraine’s capital and topple its leader at the start of Moscow's invasion nearly four years ago.\n\nThe ouster of Maduro highlights another Kremlin failure to support an ally, following the downfall of Syria’s former President Bashar Assad in 2024 and last year’s U.S. and Israeli attacks on Iran. With the U.S. determined to establish control over Venezuela, Russia stands to lose a strategic foothold in the Western Hemisphere, along with billions of dollars invested in its oil industry.\n\nBut President Donald Trump's actions in Venezuela also are causing unease in Western nations and giving the Kremlin fresh talking points to defend its war in Ukraine.\n\nIn addition, Trump’s interest in wresting control of Greenland from NATO ally Denmark also threatens to destabilize the alliance at the moment when the U.S.-led efforts to broker peace in Ukraine enter a pivotal stage, distracting its members from their efforts to support Kyiv and provide it with security guarantees.\n\nPutin himself hasn’t commented on the U.S. actions in Venezuela, which his diplomats have denounced as a blatant act of aggression. Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president who serves as his deputy on the presidential Security Council, similarly rebuked Washington for trampling international law — but also complimented Trump on defending U.S. interests.\n\n“Even though Trump’s action is completely unlawful, he cannot be denied a certain consistency — he and his team are very aggressively upholding their country’s national interests,” Medvedev said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. said it seized two sanctioned oil tankers linked to Venezuela, including one flagged to Russia in the North Atlantic.\n\nMoscow's ‘spheres of influence’\n\nSince 2014's illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula that followed the ouster of a pro-Kremlin president in Kyiv, Putin has sought to justify his action by describing his neighbor as part of Russia’s sphere of influence where Western encroachment can’t be allowed.\n\nPutin has argued that just as the U.S. would bristle at any foreign military presence in the Western Hemisphere, Russia sees NATO’s expansion to its borders as a major security threat. He cited Ukraine’s bid to join the military alliance as a key reason behind his full-scale invasion of the country.\n\n“We have made it clear and unambiguous that further eastward expansion of NATO is unacceptable,” Putin said shortly before sending troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. “Are we the ones placing missiles near the U.S. borders? No, it’s the U.S. that has brought its missiles to our doorstep.”\n\nLong before the invasion, Russia tested the ground on a possible deal under which it would refrain from meddling in Latin America in exchange for the U.S. offering Moscow free rein in Europe.\n\nFiona Hill, who oversaw Russia and Europe on Trump's National Security Council during his first term, testified before Congress in 2019 that the Russians were signaling their willingness to make such an arrangement involving Venezuela and Ukraine.\n\nRussia never made a formal offer, Hill told The Associated Press in an interview, but Moscow’s then-ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, “hinted ... many times” to her that Russia could cede its influence in Venezuela to the U.S. in exchange for a sphere of influence in Europe.\n\nShe said Trump's administration wasn’t interested in the Russian overtures that she described as a “hint-hint, nudge-nudge, wink-wink, how-about-doing-a-deal” offer. In April 2019, Hill was sent to Moscow to convey the message that “nobody’s interested. ... Ukraine and Venezuela are not related to each other.”\n\nHill said she did not know if the winds have now changed and whether there was any deal between the U.S. and Russia to swap spheres of influence in Venezuela and Ukraine, but she noted that many officials, including herself, who were involved in “restraining” Trump in his first term aren't around for his second.\n\nShe argued that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio would likely be the only member of the Trump administration who would now resist such a proposal, but added that others, including Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, could have a different view.\n\n“Who knows what Witkoff and others have been chatting about recently?” Hill asked.\n\nBefore Maduro was captured, AP reported Russia had started evacuating families of diplomats from Venezuela. When asked about the move, Hill said it would not be “implausible” that Witkoff gave Moscow a “courtesy heads-up.”\n\nSam Greene, a Russia expert at King’s College London, observed that Moscow may have backed down on Venezuela in the expectation of the U.S. giving it a free hand on Ukraine.\n\n“My worry is that it may be part of a tacit agreement, by which Washington, Moscow and Beijing agree not to deter one another against interventions in their putative spheres of influence,” he wrote on X.\n\nRussia’s foothold in Western Hemisphere\n\nBefore the invasion of Ukraine, senior Russian officials had issued vague warnings that Moscow could deploy troops or military assets to Cuba and Venezuela — statements that the U.S. dismissed as bluster. Some drew parallels to the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis — when the Soviet Union deployed missiles to Cuba and the U.S. imposed a naval blockade of the island.\n\nRussian-Cuban ties withered after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, plunging Cuba into a grueling depression. Soon after his first election in 2000, Putin ordered the closure of a Soviet-built military surveillance facility in Cuba as he sought to improve ties with Washington. As tensions with the U.S. and its allies mounted, however, Moscow again intensified trade and other contacts with Cuba and sent warships to visit the island.\n\nRussia also has invested heavily in Venezuela's oil industry, as did China, and offered Caracas generous loans to purchase top-of-the-line air defense missiles, fighter jets and other weapons. On several occasions, most recently in 2018, it dispatched its nuclear-capable Tu-160 bombers to Venezuela in a projection of force.\n\nMilitary experts have said, however, that any attempt by Russia to establish a permanent military foothold in the Western Hemisphere would face overwhelming logistical challenges.\n\nThe ‘might-makes-right’ doctrine\n\nThe U.S. seizure of Maduro and his wife was seen worldwide as the return of the “might- makes-right” doctrine, backing Moscow’s argument that its action in Ukraine protects its vital interests the way the U.S. did in Venezuela.\n\nAfter its action in Venezuela, the U.S. has “nothing to formally reproach our country for,” Medvedev noted.\n\nHill noted that Maduro’s capture makes it harder for countries to condemn Russia’s action in Ukraine because “we’ve just had a situation where the U.S. has taken over — or at least decapitated the government of another country — using fiction.”\n\nAn indictment accuses Maduro and others of working with drug cartels to facilitate the shipment of thousands of tons of cocaine into the U.S.\n\nFyodor Lukyanov, a Kremlin-connected, Moscow-based foreign policy expert, observed that “if we consider what’s happening from the perspective of setting a precedent, then we couldn’t ask for anything better, and this includes Trump’s conviction that the authorities in Venezuela must be approved by Washington.”\n\nRussian hawks, meanwhile, argue the U.S. action in Venezuela has created a new sense of urgency for Moscow to dramatically speed up its offensive in Ukraine.\n\n“Ukraine under our full control is our pass to the Great Powers club,” Alexander Dugin, a hard-line nationalist ideologue, wrote in a commentary.\n\nAP European Security Correspondent Emma Burrows in London contributed.",

Shares of top contractors clawed back losses from Wednesday's session spurred by Trump's statement that he would ban defense companies from issuing dividends and stock buybacks unless military production and maintenance are enhanced.\n\nHere were the big movers Thursday morning:\n\nThe White House declined to comment further.\n\nThe strength of the US military has long been a key focus for Trump, but his attention on the US military has sharpened after the US conducted its raid on Venezuela and captured the nation's president this month.

Also known as Yo Kitano, he has been banned from entering China. He told reporters that his arrival in Taiwan demonstrated the two are “different countries.”\n\n“I came to Taiwan … to prove this point, and to tell the world that Taiwan is an independent country,” Hei Seki said, according to Taiwan’s Central News Agency.\n\n“The nasty words of a petty villain like him are not worth commenting on,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning retorted when asked about his comment.\n\nMasaaki Kanai, head of Asia Oceanian Affairs at Japan's Foreign Ministry, urged China to scrap the trade curbs, saying a measure exclusively targeting Japan that deviates from international practice is unacceptable. Japan, however, has yet to announce any retaliatory measures.\n\nAs the two countries feuded, speculation rose that China might target rare earths exports to Japan, in a move similar to the rounds of critical minerals export restrictions it has imposed as part of its trade war with the United States.\n\nChina controls most of the global production of heavy rare earths, used for making powerful, heat-resistant magnets used in industries such as defense and electric vehicles.\n\nWhile the Commerce Ministry did not mention any new rare earths curbs, the official newspaper China Daily, seen as a government mouthpiece, quoted anonymous sources saying Beijing was considering tightening exports of certain rare earths to Japan. That report could not be independently confirmed.\n\nImproved South Korean ties contrast with Japan row\n\nAs Beijing spars with Tokyo, it has made a point of courting a different East Asian power — South Korea.\n\nOn Wednesday, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung wrapped up a four-day trip to China – his first since taking office in June. Lee and Chinese President Xi Jinping oversaw the signing of cooperation agreements in areas such as technology, trade, transportation and environmental protection.\n\nAs if to illustrate a contrast with the China-Japan trade frictions, Lee joined two business events at which major South Korean and Chinese companies pledged to collaborate.\n\nThe two sides signed 24 export contracts worth a combined $44 million, according to South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Resources.\n\nDuring Lee’s visit, Chinese media also reported that South Korea overtook Japan as the leading destination for outbound flights from China’s mainland over the New Year’s holiday.\n\nChina has been discouraging travel to Japan, saying Japanese leaders’ comments on Taiwan have created “significant risks to the personal safety and lives of Chinese citizens in Japan.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump abruptly changed his tone Wednesday about his Colombian counterpart, Gustavo Petro, saying they had exchanged a friendly phone call and he’d even invited the leader of the South American country to the White House.\n\n“It was a Great Honor to speak with the President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, who called to explain the situation of drugs and other disagreements that we have had,” Trump posted on his social media site. “I appreciated his call and tone, and look forward to meeting him in the near future.”\n\nHe wrote that the upcoming meeting would take place at the White House.\n\nThat came mere days after Trump said in the wake of the U.S. operation to oust Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend that “Colombia is very sick too” and accused Petro of ”making cocaine and selling it to the United States.\"\n\nIn comments to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump added of Petro, “He’s not going to be doing it very long, let me tell you.” Asked whether U.S. intervention was possible, Trump responded, ”Sounds good to me.”\n\nLater Wednesday, addressing thousands of protesters that he had mobilized to rally against U.S. military threats, Petro said he had spoken with Trump for roughly one hour.\n\n“I talked about two things: Venezuela and the issue of drug trafficking,” he told the crowd in downtown Bogotá, where demonstrators had just minutes earlier chanted slogans against the United States at Petro’s behest.\n\nPetro explained to the audience that Colombian politicians allegedly linked to narco-trafficking misled the U.S. president about Petro’s record to turn Trump against him.\n\n“Those (people) are responsible for this crisis — let’s call it diplomatic for now, verbal for now — that has erupted between the U.S. and Colombia,” he said.\n\nTrump now suddenly warming to Petro is especially surprising since Colombia’s president called the U.S. operation in Venezuela an “abhorrent” violation of Latin American sovereignty. He also suggested it was committed by “enslavers” and constituted a “spectacle of death” comparable to Nazi Germany’s 1937 carpet bombing of Guernica, Spain.\n\nColombia has long been among America’s staunchest Latin American allies, a pillar of Washington’s counternarcotics strategy abroad. For three decades, the U.S. has worked closely with Colombia, the world’s largest producer of cocaine, to arrest drug traffickers, fend off rebel groups and boost economic development in rural areas.\n\nStill, before Trump's conciliatory post, tensions had been rising between the U.S. and Colombia for months.\n\nThe Trump administration imposed sanctions in October on Petro, his family and a member of his government over accusations of involvement in the global drug trade. Colombia is considered the epicenter of the world’s cocaine trade.\n\nTrump began his monthslong pressure campaign on Maduro by ordering dozens of lethal strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats launched from Venezuela in the Caribbean. He eventually expanded the operations to also target suspected vessels in the eastern Pacific that came from Colombia.\n\nThe U.S. in September added Colombia, the top recipient of American assistance in the region, to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years. The designation led to a slashing of U.S. assistance to the country.\n\n“He has cocaine mills and cocaine factories,\" Trump said of Petro on Sunday. \"He’s not going to be doing it.”\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the spelling of the Colombian president's name.",

    "description": "-Mughrabi Jan 7 (Reuters) - Mohammad Sinwar, the elusive Hamas military chief in Gaza, had for months since the death of his brother, in 2024, been Israel's most wanted man.",
    "fullText": "Jan 7 (Reuters) - Mohammad Sinwar, the elusive Hamas military chief in Gaza, had for months since the death of his brother, in 2024, been Israel's most wanted man. On December 29, Hamas announced that he had died, aged 49, around seven months after Israel said it killed him in a strike.\n\nHamas did not provide details on Sinwar's death but ​said it mourned him along with other group leaders, describing them as \"heroic martyrs\". Hamas confirmed in the statement that Sinwar had been the head of the group's armed forces.\n\nSinwar was elevated ‌to the top ranks of Hamas in 2024 after the death in combat of his brother Yahya, mastermind of the October 2023 attack on Israel that led to the war in Gaza and later overall leader of the Palestinian organisation.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ‌in May 2025 that Sinwar had been killed. Less than two weeks later, the Israeli army said it had retrieved Sinwar's body in an underground tunnel beneath a hospital in southern Gaza.\n\nSinwar's death is expected to leave his next in command Izzeldeen Haddad, who had been overseeing operations in northern Gaza, in charge of Hamas' armed wing across the whole of the enclave.\n\nIt is unclear how the death will affect decision-making in Hamas more broadly - for example, whether it will bolster or diminish the influence of exiled members of the group's leadership council on policy matters, in particular the full implementation of the Gaza ceasefire plan agreed with Israel in October.\n\nHamas officials described ⁠Sinwar as a \"ghost\" who long outfoxed Israel's intelligence agencies.\n\nLike his brother Yahya, Sinwar ‌had survived many Israeli assassination attempts, including airstrikes and planted explosives, Hamas sources said.\n\nWhen Sinwar once visited a cemetery, his comrades discovered a remote-controlled explosive resembling a brick planted along his path, according to the Hamas sources.\n\nIn 2003, Hamas operatives discovered a bomb in the wall of Mohammad Sinwar's house, foiling an assassination attempt that the ‍group blamed on Israeli intelligence.\n\nKnown for clandestine operations, Mohammad Sinwar played a central role in planning and executing Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, the country's worst security failure, Hamas sources said.\n\nHe was also widely believed to have been one of the masterminds of the 2006 cross-border attack and abduction of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.\n\nHamas held Shalit for five years before he was swapped for more than 1,000 Palestinians jailed by Israel.\n\nUnder the deal, his brother Yahya Sinwar, whose ​meticulous planning for the 2023 attack shattered Israel's reputation as an invincible power in a hostile region, was among those who were released.\n\nNetanyahu has vowed to eradicate Hamas. The offensive against ‌Gaza by the Israeli Defence Forces, the Middle East's most advanced military, severely weakened the organisation.\n\nYahya Sinwar was killed in combat during a routine Israeli patrol in Gaza in 2024.\n\nIsrael released footage of a severely wounded Yahya Sinwar throwing a piece of wood at a hovering drone - his last act of defiance towards his old foe before his death and his brother's rise.\n\nBut the group, which was created during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation in 1987 and which carried out suicide bombings that traumatised Israelis in the second one, is still standing.\n\nBorn on September 16, 1975, Sinwar rarely appeared in public or spoke to the media. He granted a lengthy interview to Al Jazeera for a documentary broadcast in 2022, but wore a cap and sat in the dark to hide his appearance.\n\nThe Sinwars originally came from Asqalan - now the Israeli ⁠city of Ashkelon, a short distance to the north of the Gaza Strip. Alongside hundreds of thousands of other Palestinians, ​they became refugees in what they call the Nakba, or catastrophe, at the time of Israel's declaration of independence during the ​1948 war.\n\nThe family settled in Khan Younis in Gaza, which has been largely reduced to rubble in the latest war.\n\nMohammad Sinwar was educated in schools run by the United Nations' Palestinian relief agency (UNRWA), which has long been a target of Israeli criticism, including during the recent war in Gaza.\n\nHe joined Hamas shortly after its founding, influenced by his brother ‍Yahya, a former member of the Muslim Brotherhood, the ⁠oldest and at one time most influential Islamist group in the Middle East.\n\nHis reputation as a hardliner helped him rise through the group's military ranks. By 2005, he was leading Hamas' Khan Younis Brigade.\n\nThe unit, one of the largest and most powerful battalions in Hamas' armed wing, has been responsible for cross-border attacks, firing rockets and planting bombs along the frontier. “Striking Tel Aviv is easier than ⁠drinking water,\" Sinwar told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe unit also watches the movements of Israeli soldiers around the clock. In 2006, elite commandos led by Sinwar took part in Shalit's abduction.\n\nSources close to Hamas say Sinwar developed close ties with Marwan Issa, the deputy commander ‌of Hamas' military wing, and Mohammed Deif, the aloof military chief. Both men were killed by Israel in 2024.\n\nIn its statement announcing Sinwar's death on December 29, Hamas said that ‌he had succeeded Deif.",

It called the move \"absolutely unacceptable and deeply regrettable\" and said the measures targeted only Japan and that they \"deviate significantly from international practice.\"Johnson said Japan is unlikely to respond immediately but could retaliate if restrictions intensify, adding that other countries could potentially follow suit.",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran's army chief threatened preemptive military action Wednesday over the “rhetoric” targeting the Islamic Republic, likely referring to U.S. President Donald Trump's warning that if Tehran “violently kills peaceful protesters,” the United States “will come to their rescue.\"\n\nThe comments by Maj. Gen. Amir Hatami come as Iran tries to respond to what it sees as a dual threat posed by Israel and the United States, as well as the protests sparked by its economic woes that have grown into a direct challenge to its theocracy.\n\nSeeking to halt the anger, Iran's government began Wednesday paying the equivalent of $7 a month to subsidize rising costs for dinner table essentials like rice, meat and pastas. Shopkeepers warn prices for items as basic as cooking oil likely will triple under pressure from the collapse of Iran's rial currency and the end of a preferential subsidized dollar-rial exchange rate for importers and manufacturers — likely fueling further popular anger.\n\n“More than a week of protests in Iran reflects not only worsening economic conditions, but longstanding anger at government repression and regime policies that have led to Iran’s global isolation,” the New York-based Soufan Center think tank said.\n\nHatami spoke to military academy students. He took over as commander in chief of Iran's army, known by the Farsi word \"Artesh,\" after Israel killed a number of the country's top military commanders in June's 12-day war. He is the first regular military officer in decades to hold a position long controlled by Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.\n\n“The Islamic Republic considers the intensification of such rhetoric against the Iranian nation as a threat and will not leave its continuation without a response,\" Hatami said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency.\n\nHe added, “I can say with confidence that today the readiness of Iran’s armed forces is far greater than before the war. If the enemy commits an error, it will face a more decisive response, and we will cut off the hand of any aggressor.”\n\nIranian officials, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have been responding to Trump's comments, which took on more significance after the U.S. military raid that seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a longtime ally of Tehran, over the weekend. But there's been no immediate public sign of Iran preparing for an attack in the region.\n\nIranian state television reported on the start of a new subsidy of the equivalent of $7, put into the bank accounts of heads of households across the country. More than 71 million people will receive the benefit, which is 10 million Iranian rials, it reported. The rial now trades at over 1.4 million to $1 and continues to depreciate.\n\nThe subsidy is more than double than the 4.5 million rial people previously received. But already, Iranian media report sharp rises in the cost of basic goods, including cooking oil, poultry and cheese, placing additional strain on households already burdened by international sanctions targeting the country and inflation.\n\nIran's vice president in charge of executive affairs, Mohammad Jafar Ghaempanah, told reporters on Wednesday that the country was in a “full-fledged economic war.” He called for “economic surgery” to eliminate rentier policies and corruption within the country.\n\nIran has faced rounds of nationwide protests in recent years. As sanctions tightened and Iran struggled after the June war with Israel, its rial currency sharply fell in December. Protests began soon after on Dec. 28. They reached their 11th day on Wednesday and didn't appear to be stopping.\n\nSocial media videos purported to show new cities like Bojnourd, Kerman, Rasht, Shiraz and Tabriz, as well some smaller towns, joining the demonstrations on Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency offered the latest death toll of 36 for the demonstrations. It said 30 protesters, four children and two members of Iran’s security forces have been killed. Demonstrations have reached over 310 locations in 28 of Iran’s 31 provinces. More than 2,100 people have been arrested, it said.\n\nThe group, which relies on an activist network inside of Iran for its reporting, has been accurate in past unrest.",

    "fullText": "A preschool teacher was arrested on camera as soon as she finished a TV interview criticizing Donald Trump, fueling the debate over protest policing and free speech.\n\nJessica Plichta, 22, said she was the only person arrested among roughly 200 demonstrators at an anti-war protest in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Saturday, hours after Nicolas Maduro was detained in Caracas by the U.S. military.\n\nIn the broadcast footage, two officers could be seen approaching from behind as she wrapped her interview with WZZM, the city’s ABC affiliate, then escorted her away as she told them, “I am not resisting arrest.”\n\nWZZM said an officer cited “obstructing a roadway and failure to obey a lawful command,” and that Plichta had been charged with failure to obey a lawful command.\n\nPlichta later told Zeteo: “I don’t think it’s a coincidence that as soon as I finished an interview speaking on Venezuela, I was arrested.”\n\nShe told the outlet the officers shoved her into the back of a patrol car without fastening her seat belt, then drove a short distance down the street—out of view of cameras and bystanders.\n\nAccording to Plichta, they stopped again, pulled her out, bent her over the vehicle, patted her down, and took her belongings. She recalled one officer saying they moved her because she was “making a scene.”\n\nShe also said officers repeatedly pressed her on whether she was Venezuelan, what her connection to Venezuela was, and why she had attended the protest. Plichta claimed they tried to get her to identify other demonstrators.\n\n“We are so accustomed to, and used to, repression when we speak out on anti-war topics. When we speak out for Venezuela, when we speak out for Palestine, we expect the police to want to shut that down,” she told Zeteo.\n\n“It just shows how much they feel they can get away with things, how easy it is for them to isolate people from the public eye when they’re doing this.”\n\nPlichta said she largely stayed quiet as officers took her to jail, where she said the same questions continued. She was released about three hours later after other protesters gathered to demand she be freed and was seen punching the air in a video shared on Facebook.\n\nThe Grand Rapids Police Department disputed her claims in a statement to the Daily Beast.\n\nA spokesperson said more than “25 announcements were made from the PA system of a marked police cruiser for the group [of protesters] to leave the roadway and relocate their activities to the sidewalk,” but that they had “refused lawful orders” to move to the sidewalk and “began blocking intersections.”\n\nAdding that supervisors told officers they could arrest anyone who could be “positively identified,” the spokesperson confirmed only one arrest was made. The Beast followed up to ask why only Plichta had been arrested, but had not received a response at the time of publication.\n\nThe mayor of Grand Rapids is David LaGrand, a Democrat.\n\nThe incident came to light as Trump, 79, tries to sell the Maduro operation at home, despite signs of public unease.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released Monday found about one in three Americans approve of the U.S. strike, while 72 percent worry the U.S. will become too involved.\n\nIt is also a small part of a much larger information war that has even seen Trump amplify mislabeled footage on Truth Social to claim mass celebrations after the Maduro capture—a video that fact-checkers traced to an unrelated 2024 protest.",

    "description": "Deal indicates Venezuelan government is responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention",
    "fullText": "Deal indicates Venezuelan government is responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention\n\nDonald Trump has said Venezuela will be “turning over” $2bn worth of Venezuelan crude to the United States, a flagship negotiation that would divert supplies from China while helping Venezuela avoid deeper oil production cuts.\n\n“This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!” Trump said in a post online.\n\nVenezuelan government officials and state company PDVSA did not provide comment.\n\nVenezuela has millions of barrels of oil loaded on tankers and in storage tanks that it has been unable to ship due to the blockade imposed by Trump, as part of the pressure campaign that culminated in the toppling of Nicolás Maduro who was seized from his country by US forces over the weekend.\n\nTop Venezuelan officials have called Maduro’s capture a kidnapping and accused the US of trying to steal the country’s vast oil reserver, however Tuesday’s agreement is a strong sign that the government is responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention.\n\nTrump has said he wants interim president Delcy Rodríguez to give the US and private companies “total access” to Venezuela’s oil industry.\n\nUS energy secretary Chris Wright is in charge of executing the deal, Trump said, adding that the oil will be taken from ships and sent directly to US ports. Supplying the trapped crude to the US could initially require reallocating cargoes originally bound for China, two sources had told Reuters earlier on Tuesday.\n\nChina has been Venezuela’s top buyer in the last decade and especially since the United States imposed sanctions on companies involved in oil trade with Venezuela in 2020.\n\nUS crude prices fell more than 1.5% after Trump’s announcement, with the agreement expected to increase the volume of Venezuelan oil exported to the US. That flow of oil is currently controlled entirely by Chevron, PDVSA’s main joint venture partner, under a US authorisation.\n\nChevron, which has been exporting between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan oil to the US, is the only company that has been loading and shipping crude without interruption from the South American country in recent weeks under the blockade.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Venezuela would have any access to proceeds from the supply. Sanctions mean PDVSA is excluded from the global financial system, its bank accounts are frozen and it is blocked from executing transactions in US dollars\n\nHours before Trump’s announcement on Tuesday, Rodríguez hardened her tone against the US, saying in a televised address that “no external agent governs Venezuela” – a clear rebuttal to the US president’s claim that, after the capture of Maduro, the US would now run the South American country.\n\nIt marked another shift in tone from Maduro’s former vice-president. After being sworn in as president by Venezuela’s supreme court on Saturday, Rodríguez released a conciliatory statement late on Sunday in which she “invited the US government to work together on an agenda of cooperation”.\n\nIn Tuesday’s address, however, Rodríguez reverted to harsher language, describing Saturday’s strike – the first large-scale US military operation on South American soil – as a “terrible military aggression” and a “criminal attack” whose “absolutely illegal outcome, in violation of international law”, was the “kidnapping” of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.\n\n“We are a people who do not surrender, who do not give up, and we are here, governing together with the people. The government of Venezuela rules in our country – no one else. There is no external agent governing Venezuela. It is Venezuela, its constitutional government, and the consolidated power of the people,” said Rodríguez, who had served as Maduro’s vice-president since 2018.",

    "fullText": "Satellite imagery released in the aftermath of US airstrikes launched in support of the operation to apprehend Nicolás Maduro shows damage beyond a major military base.\n\nA satellite photo taken on Saturday by the US commercial imaging company Planet Labs PBC and obtained by Business Insider shows damage at the Higuerote Airport on Venezuela's northern coast, several dozen miles east of the capital Caracas.\n\nA crater or burn mark can be seen adjacent to the eastern end of the runway, and another on the apron near a collection of buildings.\n\nVideo shared on social media appeared to show explosions and fires at Higuerote Airport during the surprise US operation, Absolute Resolve, which began late Friday night and continued for several more hours into Saturday morning.\n\nVenezuela's air defenses are primarily comprised of Russian-made technology. US fighter jets, surveillance planes, bombers, and drones targeted these systems at the beginning of the raid, effectively clearing a path for low-flying helicopter apprehension forces to locate and capture the former president, Maduro, and his wife.\n\n\"Seems those Russian air defenses didn't quite work so well, did they?\" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said during remarks at the Newport News Shipyard in Virginia on Monday.\n\nIn addition to the damage seen at Higuerote Airport, satellite imagery taken by the US spatial intelligence firm Vantor revealed significant damage to buildings and equipment at Fuerte Tiuna, a major military installation in Caracas that houses defense ministries, critical commands, official residences, and other strategic infrastructure.\n\nConflict analysts at the Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank, said that geolocated footage indicated American forces also targeted port infrastructure, telecommunication towers, and an airbase in and around Caracas.\n\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment on the targets struck during Operation Absolute Resolve. The White House directed BI to the Saturday press briefing on the mission.\n\nMore than 150 US aircraft participated in the mission to capture Maduro, which relied on months of extensive planning and rehearsal, including building a replica of Maduro's compound that American personnel stormed. US intelligence agencies had mapped out details and patterns of his life in advance.\n\nThe operation marked a dramatic culmination of months of rising tensions between the Trump administration and Maduro, whom the US has accused of facilitating drug trafficking and other criminal activity. The ousted leader is now in New York facing narco-terrorism charges. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe US established a large military presence in the Caribbean over the past few months, deploying an aircraft carrier strike group, cruisers, destroyers, advanced fighter jets, and thousands of troops.\n\nSince early September, the US has carried out dozens of airstrikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, killing more than 100 people in a campaign that drew sharp criticism from lawmakers and legal experts.\n\nIt is unclear how long the US will maintain this force presence in the region. President Donald Trump issued warnings to several neighboring countries over the weekend — including Cuba, Colombia, and Mexico — raising concerns of additional military action. He has also threatened Venezuela with follow-on strikes if it doesn't cooperate.",

    "fullText": "It's only been days since an audacious U.S. raid snatched Nicolás Maduro from a Venezuelan military base and sped him to a Brooklyn prison, yet Detroit-area Trump supporter Aaron Tobin can already see it all playing out on the big screen.\n\nIt'll be the subject of movies for years to come, he predicts. “I am thrilled.” Plenty of others who voted for President Donald Trump and spoke to The Associated Press about the raid are applauding, too — at least for now.\n\nThe seizure of Venezuela's authoritarian leader and his wife has forced another reckoning on the “Make America Great Again” coalition, already rocked by the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files and strained by rising health insurance premiums and living costs.\n\nTrump promised his voters that “America First” would stand against more foreign entanglements. Instead, he intervened with force and without congressional approval in a new frontier, a South American capital so far from Washington that Google Maps says it “can't seem to find a way there.”\n\nThe geopolitical action film that Tobin sees in his mind is only at its opening scene, before all the complexities of uprooting a foreign government by a U.S. president's fiat come rushing in. U.S. forces entered and exited swiftly. But what happens next?\n\nTrump finds early but not endless support\n\nEarly on, the pushback from congressional Republicans and Trump's core constituencies has been guarded, in contrast to their uproar over the Epstein episode or the tensions coursing through Republican politics over the now-expired health insurance subsidies.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Trump voters interviewed by AP journalists around the country praised the operation and expressed faith in Trump's course. But not always limitless faith. They did not all back up Trump's claim that those who “voted for me are thrilled. They said, ‘This is what we voted for.’”\n\n“I support him so far,” Paul Bonner, 67, told AP while browsing at a Trump merchandise store in Bensalem, Pennsylvania. “Until he messes up, I support him.”\n\nTrump's apparent willingness to stay involved in Venezuela and his intensifying rhetoric about expanding U.S. power elsewhere in the hemisphere are making some of his die-hard supporters nervous.\n\nNot all of them are reaching for the popcorn yet.\n\nIn Mississippi, a conflicted Trump voter\n\nChase Lewis, 24, of Philadelphia, Mississippi, said the move caught him off guard and he still isn’t sure whether he supports it. “It’s good that they’re finally freed from that dictatorship,” he said of Venezuelans, “but I don’t know what it’s going to cost us.”\n\nHe added: “I don’t want my friends that are serving right now to be dragged into a war because we went and stuck our nose in Venezuela’s business.” He noted that Trump had campaigned against starting new wars. “Depending on how you look at it,” he said, “this was an act of war.”\n\nAn electrician apprentice who gave up his delivery job because he needed to make more money, Lewis said he wants to see the Trump administration focus on bringing down costs for young people like himself. He also wants the president to make life better for veterans and worries about plunging the country into more conflicts.\n\nIn Colorado, cheers and caution from Trump voters\n\nTo Trump voter Travis Garcia, leaning against his red pickup truck on a chilly evening in Castle Rock, Colorado, it’s a slam-dunk. “Of course I’m going to be happy that they captured a dictator that’s constantly sending drugs our way,” he said, “If we’re not gonna do it, who’s gonna do it?”\n\nThe 45-year-old, who works in remodeling, said the operation reinforces Trump's stature as “a powerful man who follows through on his word and isn’t going to be shy and timid and let other countries run the rules.”\n\nMary Lussier, 48, a flight attendant from the town of Larkspur, was so amazed by the success of the mission in Venezuela that she would be OK with more such operations. She recalled videos of Venezuelans tearfully celebrating Maduro's removal and said fewer bad leaders “would make the world a little bit lesser of a bad place.”\n\nStill, Lussier wouldn’t want U.S. soldiers stuck in a prolonged conflict, and much of her admiration for the operation hinged less on the possible benefits to the U.S. than on the smooth efficiency and bravado of the raiders.\n\nOutside a Safeway grocery store in Castle Rock, Patrick McCans, 66, said delicately that Trump's intervention was “a little contrary to what he campaigned on.”\n\n“I would like to see more of a diplomatic way of making change,” said the retired engineer. Still, he said, pondering for a moment, “I think in this case it might have been warranted.”\n\nInstead of playing ball, Maduro was “playing chicken with Trump, and Trump doesn’t like chicken,” he said, chuckling from beneath a Baltimore Ravens baseball cap.\n\nThe Colorado Trump supporters interviewed by AP all applauded the military operation’s smoothness and “class,” as one described it. But that support could waver if the U.S. is drawn into a longer conflict, which none of them would support.\n\nFew mentioned Trump’s plans for Venezuela’s oil, but thought Maduro's removal would benefit citizens and slow the drug trade and immigration to the U.S.\n\nFrom Pennsylvania: Good riddance to Maduro\n\nAt the Golden Dawn Diner in Levittown, Pennsylvania, Ron Soto, 88, expressed unreserved faith in the president's ability to manage what comes next. The retired tractor-trailer driver regularly visits the diner to meet friends, drink coffee and catch up.\n\nMaduro is an “awful man,” he said. But should U.S. forces go into other countries, like Cuba, as it did in Venezuela? “I don’t think they’ll have to,” he said. “Because he (Trump) put the fear in them.”\n\nAs for Trump's comment at one point that his administration would “run” Venezuela, Soto said the president will “straighten that country out and make it into a democracy if he can. I don’t know if he can.”\n\nAt the Neshaminy Mall, in Bensalem, retired firefighter Kevin Carey, 62, pronounced himself supportive of what Trump did but aware of the risks.\n\n“I wouldn’t say thrilled but I’m cautiously optimistic,” he said. Carey recalled the seizing of U.S. hostages by Iranian revolutionaries in 1979 as an indication of what might happen if the conflict escalates. But “he'll take all actions to avoid that, I believe,” he said of Trump.\n\nOn any further foreign intervention, Carey broke out laughing when he said: “He wants Greenland to be part of America!”\n\nAt the Trump merchandise store where Bonner shopped, banners and other items proclaiming “Trump 2028” are on display. Trump is constitutionally prohibited from running in 2028.\n\n“I know he can’t run for president” in 2028, said Bonner, a propane company worker. Still, he wanted a lawn sign “just to irritate people” but didn't find one.\n\nThe crisp military operation plainly left him impressed. “They got in and they got out, did what they had to do,” he said. Of Maduro, he said: “He’s an enemy of the United States so I support Trump 100%.”\n\nExiting a Walmart in Martinsville, Indiana, Mark Edward Miller, 75, from nearby Mooresville, said the only thing that surprised him about Trump's intervention was that word of it did not leak in advance. The consistent Trump voter was an aircraft maintenance specialist in the Air Force before his retirement.\n\n“I don’t feel like he’s actually taken over a country,” Miller said. “I believe that he’s doing exactly what our country should be doing — supporting, especially in our hemisphere, governments that are friendly with us” and challenging those that are hostile.\n\nTobin, the man in Michigan who sees a cinematic future for the raid, not only approved of the operation but wants more of them.\n\n“Especially if they were as successful as this last one where we didn’t lose any troops, we didn’t lose any planes or ships,” Tobin said during a visit to the Oakland County Republican Party headquarters, where he was surrounded by Trump and GOP memorabilia. “I am thrilled and surprised” by what happened.\n\n“Cuba’s very nervous right now,” he said. “And the Cuban people are suffering immensely from their horrible situation and their economy. Iran might be next.”\n\nThe three-time Trump voter is an active member of the local Republican Party, a certified firearms instructor and head of a bicycling group in his hometown of Oak Park, Michigan.\n\nHis takeaway: “President Trump does not speak idly. If he says he’s going to do something, he does something.”\n\nBedayn reported from Colorado, Catalini from Pennsylvania, Householder from Michigan, Bates from Mississippi, Lamy from Indiana and Woodward from Washington.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — There are few signs that President Donald Trump’s supporters wanted the United States to become more embroiled in foreign conflicts ahead of its military actions in Venezuela — even as many Republicans show initial support for his military strike there, according to an Associated Press analysis of recent polling.\n\nMost Americans wanted the U.S. government to focus in 2026 on domestic issues, such as health care and high costs, rather than foreign policy issues, an AP-NORC poll conducted last month found. Meanwhile, polling conducted in the immediate aftermath of the military operation that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro suggested that many Americans are unconvinced that the U.S. should step in to take control of the country.\n\nAnd despite Trump’s suggestion that the U.S. may take a more expansive role in the Western Hemisphere, Republicans in polling last fall remained broadly opposed to the U.S. getting more involved in other countries’ problems.\n\nThere’s still room for public opinion to shift as Trump's administration clarifies its next steps for Venezuela. But it could be a challenging issue for the Republican president, particularly given Americans’ desire for the government to fix economic issues at home.\n\nForeign policy and drug trade weren’t high priorities for many Americans\n\nHeading into the new year, Americans were less likely to want the government to focus on foreign policy than they had been in recent years.\n\nAbout one-quarter of U.S. adults listed foreign policy topics — such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Israel or general involvement overseas — as something they wanted the government to prioritize in 2026, according to an open-ended AP-NORC question that asked respondents to share up to five issues they wanted the government to work on in the coming year. That was down from the prior two years, when roughly one-third of Americans considered foreign issues an important focus. Almost no one specifically named Venezuela.\n\nMaduro pleaded not guilty to federal drug trafficking charges on Monday in New York. His capture followed U.S. strikes on boats that the Trump administration said were carrying drugs from Venezuela to the U.S. Despite the Trump administration’s focus on the issue of drug trafficking, it doesn’t register at the top of Americans' lists of issues for the government to focus on. Few Americans mentioned drug-related issues as a priority, and it was primarily a Republican issue. About 1 in 10 Republicans mentioned it, compared with hardly any Democrats or independents.\n\nInstead, Americans overall were more focused on domestic issues — including health care, economic worries and cost-of-living concerns — as top priorities for the government.\n\nMore Americans say the US should not run Venezuela\n\nAmericans are split about the U.S. capturing Maduro — with many still forming opinions — according to a poll conducted by The Washington Post and SSRS using text messages over the weekend. About 4 in 10 approved of the U.S. military being sent to capture Maduro, while roughly the same share were opposed. About 2 in 10 were unsure. Republicans broadly approved of the action, while Democrats were largely opposed to it.\n\nNearly half of Americans, 45%, were opposed to the U.S. taking control of Venezuela and choosing a new government for the country. About 9 in 10 Americans said that the Venezuelan people should be the ones to decide the future leadership of their country.\n\nIn December, a Quinnipiac poll found that about 6 in 10 registered voters opposed U.S. military action in Venezuela. Republicans were more divided: About half were in support, while about one-third were opposed and 15% didn’t have an opinion.\n\nFew Republicans wanted the US more involved in the world’s problems\n\nOnly about 1 in 10 Republicans wanted the U.S. to take a “more active role” role in solving the world’s problems, according to an AP-NORC poll from September. They were much less likely than Americans overall, or Democrats and independents, to say the U.S. should become more involved. Most Republicans, 55%, said the current U.S. role in global issues was “about right.”\n\nIt could be a tricky position for a president who ran on a promise of putting “America first” and ending the country’s involvement in “forever wars.” About 7 in 10 voters who backed Trump in the 2024 presidential election said that they wanted the U.S. to take a “less active” role in solving the world’s problems, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of interviews with registered voters in all 50 states.\n\nBut at least in that poll, which was conducted before the military operation that removed Maduro, Trump's supporters still were largely behind him: About 1 in 10 Americans who voted for Trump in 2024 felt he had deserted the “America First” promise, while the overwhelming majority felt he had kept it.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump hasn't minced words about the larger message he's trying to send the world with the U.S. military raid to capture Nicolás Maduro and spirit the deposed Venezuelan leader and his wife to the United States to face federal drug trafficking charges.\n\n“American dominance in the Western Hemisphere,\" Trump declared following Maduro's capture, “will never be questioned again.”\n\nIn the days since the audacious raid, Trump and his team have doubled down on the notion that the new focus on American preeminence in the hemisphere is here to stay. He also held up Maduro's capture to make the case to neighbors to get in line or potentially face consequences.\n\nTrump’s rhetoric harkens back to the muscular talk of the late 19th and early 20th centuries when American presidents deployed the military for territorial and resource conquests, including to Cuba, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Honduras, Panama, Nicaragua, Mexico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\n“There’s been periods, Vietnam and Iraq, which have evoked questions about a return to American imperialism, but the U.S. leaders’ messages in those periods were cloaked in talk of democracy. The way Trump is talking about it is something we haven’t seen in a very long time.” said Edward Frantz, a historian at the University of Indianapolis.\n\nIn the aftermath of the operation, Trump's tough talk has been been directed at titular allies in Greenland — where he renewed calls for the U.S. to take over the Danish territory for national security reasons — and Mexico. Trump says America's southern neighbor needs to “get their act together” fighting drug cartels.\n\nTrump has also warned that longtime adversary Cuba is “going down” now that Maduro, who has provided deeply discounted oil to the economically isolated government in Havana, has been deposed. And the president has heightened anxiety with Venezuela's neighbor, telling reporters that a military operation in Colombia — the epicenter of global cocaine production — \"sounds good to me.\"\n\nThe Republican president has also said his administration will “run” Venezuela policy and threatened the country's new leader, interim President Delcy Rodríguez, with an outcome worse than Maduro's if she does not “do what’s right.” He's made plain that he expects Caracas to open its vast oil reserves to U.S. energy companies, further igniting speculation about American overreach.\n\n“We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure — the oil infrastructure — and start making money for the country,” Trump said over the weekend.\n\nThe Venezuela incursion has split Latin America, with Trump‑aligned leaders mostly from the right applauding the ouster, and non‑aligned leaders condemning it on sovereignty grounds. It's sharpened concerns that Trump might actually be serious about his desire to annex Greenland as well.\n\nLeaning on Monroe Doctrine, Trump puts neighbors on edge\n\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned Monday that Trump would mark the undoing of the transatlantic military alliance, NATO, if he attempts to follow through on his assertion that the U.S. “absolutely” needs to take over Greenland for national security reasons. The alliance, which includes the U.S. and Denmark, has been a linchpin of post-World War II security.\n\n“If the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops,” Frederiksen told Danish broadcaster TV2.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, American leaders repeatedly turned to the Monroe Doctrine, a foundational U.S. foreign policy document authored by the nation's fifth president, which had been aimed at opposing European meddling in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nNow, Trump too is leaning on the doctrine to justify U.S. intervention in Venezuela and threaten action around the hemisphere in the name of protecting the safety and welfare of Americans.\n\n“Trump's rhetoric conjures up images of Teddy Roosevelt and gunboat diplomacy. The rhetoric is a return to a pre-Great War era,” Frantz said, referring to the 26th president's intercessions in unstable Caribbean and Central American economies as well as his backing of Panama's secession from Colombia in the name of the U.S. national interest.\n\nJust weeks before the ouster of Maduro, Trump rolled out a long-awaited National Security Strategy that had some disparate elements that seemed to be at odds with each other.\n\nOn one hand, Trump, who has long eschewed America's role in foreign wars, asserted that the administration would have a “predisposition to non-interventionism.” But the strategy document also made clear that the administration would push “to restore American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere.”\n\nWith the ouster of Maduro, the administration has clearly doubled down on the latter.\n\n“This is the Western Hemisphere,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an appearance on NBC's “Meet the Press” on Sunday. \"This is where we live — and we’re not going to allow the Western Hemisphere to be a base of operation for adversaries, competitors and rivals of the United States.”\n\nThe capture of Maduro and Trump's rhetoric could certainly be a level-setting moment for global leaders as they consider what may lay ahead in the final three years of Trump's second term.\n\nAt an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting Monday, Colombian Ambassador Leonor Zalabata Torres said the raid in Venezuela was reminiscent of “the worst interference in our area in the past.”\n\n“Democracy cannot be defended or promoted through violence and coercion, and it cannot be superseded, either, by economic interests,” said Zalabata Torres, whose country requested the meeting.\n\nAt the same time, Democrats are questioning whether Trump's actions have created a permission structure for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has designs of capturing further territory from neighboring Ukraine, and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has vowed to annex the self-ruled island of Taiwan.\n\n“What the president's done in this case has essentially given Putin and Xi Jinping a hall pass,\" said Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, in an appearance on CNN.\n\nThe Russians, for their part, have condemned Trump's action in Venezuela. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, the country's U.N. envoy, said the world body “cannot allow the United States to proclaim itself as some kind of a supreme judge” to the world.\n\nAP writers Jennifer Peltz and Farnoush Amiri at the United Nations contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Both allies and adversaries of the United States on Monday used an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council to voice opposition to the audacious U.S. military operation in Venezuela that captured leader Nicolás Maduro.\n\nBefore the U.N.'s most powerful body, countries critiqued — if sometimes obliquely — President Donald Trump's intervention in the South American country and his recent comments signaling the possibility of expanding military action to countries like Colombia and Mexico over drug trafficking accusations. The Republican president also has reupped his threat to take over the Danish territory of Greenland for the sake of U.S. security interests.\n\nDenmark, which has jurisdiction over the mineral-rich island, carefully denounced U.S. prospects for taking over Greenland without mentioning its NATO ally by name.\n\n“The inviolability of borders is not up for negotiation,” said Christina Markus Lassen, Danish ambassador to the U.N.\n\nShe also defended Venezuela's sovereignty, saying “no state should seek to influence political outcomes in Venezuela through the use of threat of force or through other means inconsistent with international law.”\n\nUS allies push back on Venezuela\n\nWhile French President Emmanuel Macron recently endorsed Maduro's capture, its U.N. envoy was slightly more critical Monday, saying any violations of international law by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, which include the U.S., erodes “the very foundation of the international order.”\n\n“The military operation that has led to the capture of Maduro runs counter to the principle of peace dispute resolution and runs counter to the principle of non-use of force,\" said Jay Dharmadhikari, deputy French ambassador to the U.N.\n\nU.S. envoy Mike Waltz defended the operation in Venezuela as a justified and “surgical law enforcement operation,” calling out the 15-member council for criticizing the targeting of Maduro.\n\n“If the United Nations in this body confers legitimacy on an illegitimate narco-terrorist with the same treatment in this charter of a democratically elected president or head of state, what kind of organization is this?” said Waltz, who is Trump’s former national security adviser.\n\nMaduro's 2024 reelection was widely disputed.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement that he is “deeply concerned that rules of international law have not been respected with regard to the 3 January military action.” He said the “grave” action by the U.S. could set a precedent for how future relations between nations unfold.\n\nVenezuela calls on the UN to take action\n\nEven with the strong support for Venezuela's sovereignty, its envoy called on the U.N. to go beyond veiled comments and condemnation. Ambassador Samuel Moncada urged the Security Council to demand that Washington release Maduro and his wife.\n\n“If the kidnapping of a head of state, the bombing of a sovereign country and the open threat of further armed action are tolerated or downplayed, the message sent to the world is a devastating one: namely that the law is optional, and that force is the true arbiter of international relations,” Moncada said.\n\nHe warned that other countries can’t afford to look away: “Accepting such a logic would mean to open the door to a deeply unstable world.”\n\nNeighboring Colombia described the raid as reminiscent of “the worst interference in our area in the past.”\n\n“Democracy cannot be defended or promoted through violence and coercion, and it cannot be superseded, either, by economic interests,” Ambassador Leonor Zalabata said.\n\nChina and Russia are expectedly critical\n\nThe biggest critics of U.S. foreign policy, China and Russia, which are also permanent members of the Security Council, called for the U.N. body to unite in rejecting America turning back to an “era of lawlessness.”\n\nMaduro, like his predecessor, forged a close relationship with Russia, while China was the main destination for most Venezuelan oil.\n\n“We cannot allow the United States to proclaim itself as some kind of a supreme judge, which alone bears the right to invade any country, to label culprits, to hand down and to enforce punishments irrespective of notions of international law, sovereignty and nonintervention,” Russian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said.\n\nHis own country’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine has drawn widespread condemnation within the U.N. and from the U.S., although the Trump administration is engaging with Russia in hopes of brokering an end to the fighting.\n\nThe U.S. seized Maduro and his wife early Saturday from their home on a military base and put them aboard a U.S. warship to face prosecution in New York in a Justice Department indictment accusing them of participating in a narco-terrorism conspiracy. Maduro declared his innocence during his first appearance in a Manhattan courthouse Monday.\n\nHis stunning removal came after months of the U.S. amassing a military presence off Venezuela’s coast and blowing up alleged drug trafficking boats. Trump has insisted that the U.S. would run Venezuela at least temporarily and tap its vast oil reserves to sell to other nations.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, however, says the U.S. would enforce an oil quarantine that was already in place on sanctioned tankers and use that leverage to press policy changes in Venezuela.\n\nThis article has been changed to correct the spelling of Russian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia's name.",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — As uncertainty simmers in Venezuela, interim President Delcy Rodríguez has taken the place of her ally President Nicolás Maduro, captured by the United States in a nighttime military operation, and offered “to collaborate” with the Trump administration in what could be a seismic shift in relations between the adversary governments.\n\nRodríguez served as Maduro's vice president since 2018, overseeing much of Venezuela’s oil-dependent economy and its feared intelligence service, and was next in the presidential line of succession.\n\nShe's part of a band of senior officials in Maduro's administration that now appears to control Venezuela, even as U.S. President Donald Trump and other officials say they will pressure the government to fall in line with its vision for the oil-rich nation.\n\nOn Saturday, Venezuela’s high court ordered her to assume the role of interim president, and the leader was backed by Venezuela’s military.\n\nRodríguez, a 56-year-old lawyer and politician has had a lengthy career representing the revolution started by the late Hugo Chávez on the world stage. It's been unclear if the leader would warm up to the Trump administration or follow the same adversarial line as her predecessor.\n\nHer rise to become interim leader of the South American country came as a surprise on Saturday morning, when Trump announced that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been in communication with Rodríguez and that the Venezuelan leader was “gracious” and would work with the American government. Rubio said Rodríguez was someone the administration could work with, unlike Maduro.\n\nBut in a televised address, Rodríguez gave no indication that she would cooperate with Trump, referring to his government as “extremists\" and maintaining that Maduro was Venezuela's rightful leader.\n\n“What is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,” Rodríguez said, surrounded by high-ranking civilian officials and military leaders.\n\nTrump warned on Sunday, if Rodríguez didn't fall in line, “she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.” He added that he wanted her to provide “total access,” from oil facilities to basic infrastructure like roads, so they can be rebuilt.\n\nTrump’s comments also followed Rubio having asserted in TV interviews on Sunday that he didn’t see Rodríguez and her government as “legitimate” because he said the country never held free and fair elections.\n\nOn Sunday, in statements posted to her Instagram, she took a major shift in tone in a conciliatory message where she said she hoped to build “respectful relations” with Trump.\n\n“We invite the US government to collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation oriented towards shared development within the framework of international law to strengthen lasting community coexistence,” she wrote.\n\nA lawyer educated in Britain and France, the interim president and her brother, Jorge Rodríguez, head of the Maduro-controlled National Assembly, have sterling leftist credentials born from tragedy. Their father was a socialist leader who was arrested for his involvement in the kidnapping of American business owner William Niehous in 1976, and later died in police custody.\n\nUnlike many in Maduro’s inner circle, the Rodríguez siblings have avoided criminal indictment in the U.S., though the interim president did face U.S. sanctions during Trump's first term for her role in undermining Venezuelan democracy.\n\nRodríguez held a number of lower-level positions under Chávez's government, but gained prominence working under Maduro to the point of being seen as his successor. She served the economic minister, foreign affairs minister, petroleum minister and others help stabilize Venezuela's endemically crisis-stricken economy after years of rampant inflation and turmoil.\n\nRodríguez developed strong ties with Republicans in the oil industry and on Wall Street who balked at the notion of U.S.-led regime change. The interim president also presided over an assembly promoted by Maduro in response to street protests in 2017 meant to neutralize the opposition-majority legislature.\n\nShe enjoys a close relationship with the military, which has long acted as the arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela, said Ronal Rodríguez, a spokesperson for the Venezuela Observatory of Rosario University in Bogota, Colombia.\n\n“She has a very particular relationship with power,” he said. “She has developed very strong ties with elements of the armed forces and has managed to establish lines of dialogue with them, largely on a transactional basis.”\n\nIt's unclear how long Rodríguez will hold power, or how closely she will work with the Trump administration.\n\nGeoff Ramsey, a senior nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council, a Washington research institute, said Rodríguez's initially firm tone with the Trump administration may have been an attempt to “save face.” Others have noted that Maduro's capture required some level of collaboration within the Venezuelan government.\n\n“She can’t exactly expect to score points with her revolutionary peers if she presents herself as a patsy for U.S. interests,\" Ramsey said.\n\nVenezuela’s constitution requires an election within 30 days whenever the president becomes “permanently unavailable” to serve. Reasons listed include death, resignation, removal from office or “abandonment” of duties as declared by the National Assembly.\n\nThat electoral timeline was rigorously followed when Maduro’s predecessor, Chavez, died of cancer in 2013. However, the loyalist Supreme Court, in its decision Saturday, cited another provision of the charter in declaring Maduro’s absence a “temporary” one.\n\nIn such a scenario, there is no election requirement. Instead, the vice president, an unelected position, takes over for up to 90 days — a period that can be extended to six months with a vote of the National Assembly.\n\nIn handing temporary power to Rodríguez, the Supreme Court made no mention of the 180-day time limit, leading some to speculate she could try to remain in power even longer as she seeks to unite the disparate factions of the ruling socialist party while shielding it from what would certainly be a stiff electoral challenge.\n\n—— Janetsky reported from Mexico City and Debre reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

    "description": "Pete Hegseth announced administrative action against Sen. Mark Kelly, initiating a process that could strip the retired Navy captain of rank and pension.",
    "fullText": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced unprecedented administrative action against Sen. Mark Kelly, accusing the Arizona Democrat of “seditious” conduct and initiating a process that could strip the retired Navy captain of rank and reduce his military pension.\n\nIn a statement posted to X on Monday morning, Hegseth said the Department of Defense had begun retirement grade determination proceedings under 10 U.S.C. § 1370(f) against Kelly, citing public comments in which the senator urged service members to refuse illegal orders.\n\nHegseth also said he issued a formal Letter of Censure that will be placed in Kelly’s permanent military personnel file.\n\nSix weeks ago, Senator Mark Kelly — and five other members of Congress — released a reckless and seditious video that was clearly intended to undermine good order and military discipline. As a retired Navy Captain who is still receiving a military pension, Captain Kelly knows he…\n\n— Secretary of War Pete Hegseth (@SecWar) January 5, 2026\n\nThe dispute centers on a broader and increasingly heated debate between the Pentagon and Democratic lawmakers over the legality of recent U.S. military operations and the role of members of Congress in questioning them. Kelly and other lawmakers have argued that service members must refuse unlawful orders, while Hegseth and his allies contend such messaging undermines military discipline by casting doubt on the legality of duly authorized operations.\n\nKelly, a former Navy fighter pilot who retired at the rank of captain, is currently serving his second term in the U.S. Senate.\n\nHegseth characterized a video released earlier this year by Kelly and five other members of Congress as “reckless and seditious,” accusing the senator of undermining good order and military discipline. The video reminded service members that they have a legal obligation to refuse illegal orders, a principle embedded in U.S. military law and the laws of armed conflict.\n\nThe confrontation follows mounting scrutiny over the legal justification for U.S. military actions in Latin America, including discussions within the administration about removing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nOn Sunday’s This Week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio struggled to identify clear legal authority for such action, drawing criticism from lawmakers who argue that ambiguous or unsupported justifications heighten the risk of unlawful orders being issued or followed.\n\nHegseth asserted that Kelly remains subject to military justice as a retired officer receiving retired pay and accused him of violating Articles 133 and 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, provisions covering conduct unbecoming an officer and general misconduct.\n\nThe move is highly unusual. While retired officers technically remain subject to the UCMJ in limited circumstances, the authority is rarely invoked and has not been used to punish post-retirement political speech, particularly by a sitting member of Congress.\n\nRetirement grade determinations are typically limited to misconduct committed while an officer is on active duty.\n\nHegseth warned that Kelly’s status as a U.S. senator does not exempt him from accountability and suggested further action could follow.\n\nKelly has not yet publicly responded. The announcement is likely to prompt legal challenges and congressional scrutiny, placing the Pentagon at the center of a constitutional dispute over military authority, civilian oversight, and protected political speech.\n\nThe post Pete Hegseth Strips Sen.

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — South Korean President Lee Jae Myung arrived in China on Sunday as Beijing looks to deepen ties with the nearby country after heightened tensions between China and Japan over Taiwan, a self-ruled island it claims as its sovereign territory.\n\nLee's four-day trip is his first visit to China since taking office in June. It comes at a time of heightened tensions between China and Japan, after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in November that her country’s military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan.\n\nChina's official news agency Xinhua reported on Sunday afternoon that Lee arrived in Beijing. During his stay, Lee will meet with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, their second meeting in just two months.\n\nLee signals commitment to China's ties\n\nAhead of his trip, Lee gave an interview to China's state broadcaster CCTV at Seoul's Cheong Wa Dae, the presidential office also known as the Blue House. Lee was quoted as saying that it was his first interview held in the presidential palace and that he hoped people would understand that his government cares about the relations between Beijing and Seoul.\n\nIn the interview, he assured that South Korea consistently respects the “One-China” policy when it comes to Taiwan, CCTV reported Friday. He said the healthy development of Beijing-Seoul relations depends on mutual respect. Lee also praised Xi as a “truly reliable neighbor.\"\n\nLast week, China staged large-scale military drills around the island for two days to warn against separatist and “external interference” forces. At that time, the Chinese Foreign Ministry accused Taiwan’s ruling party of trying to seek independence through requesting U.S. support.\n\nThe U.S. planned large-scale arms sales to Taiwan angered Beijing in December, leading to China sanctioning 20 U.S. defense-related companies.\n\nLee said Seoul's cooperation with the U.S, its military ally, does not mean South Korea-China relations should move toward confrontation, CCTV reported. He acknowledged that past misunderstandings between his country and China had hindered bilateral relations.\n\n“This visit to China aims to minimize or eliminate these past misunderstandings or contradictions, to elevate and develop South Korea-China relations to a new stage,” CCTV quoted him as saying.\n\nTo discuss the Korean Peninsula and strengthen economic ties\n\nSouth Korea and the U.S. have urged China, North Korea’s traditional ally and economic pipeline, to use its influence on its socialist neighbor to convince it to return to talks or abandon its nuclear program.\n\nBut China has long been suspected of avoiding fully implementing U.N. sanctions on North Korea and sending clandestine aid shipments to help the North stay afloat and continue to serve as a bulwark against U.S. influence on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nOn Sunday, North Korea launched multiple ballistic missiles toward the sea, South Korea’s military said, the latest weapons demonstration by the North ahead of its upcoming ruling party congress.\n\nLee’s visit is meant to strengthen bilateral ties and discuss ways to restore peace on the Korean Peninsula, South Korean officials said.\n\nDuring Monday’s summit, Lee and Xi are to hold “in-depth talks on substantive ways” to address security and economic issues facing the two countries, South Korea’s national security adviser Wi Sung-lac told a briefing Friday. On Tuesday, Lee is to meet Zhao Leji, chairman of the National People’s Congress, and Premier Li Qiang, Wi said.\n\nDuring Lee’s trip, South Korea will also request that China play “a constructive role” in efforts to promote peace on the Korean Peninsula, Wi said. In their November talks, Lee already asked Xi to make greater efforts to persuade North Korea to return to talks.\n\nSouth Korea would push for substantial achievements that could directly benefit ordinary citizens in both countries too, Wi said.\n\nKim reported from Seoul, South Korea",

    "description": "The US military has experience guarding oil infrastructure, but deploying troops to Venezuela comes with high risks in a dangerous environment.",
    "fullText": "On the heels of a high-stakes mission inside Venezuela's capital that captured its indicted leader to bring him to justice, President Donald Trump said his goal now was to get major US oil companies access to its huge reserves — even if it means deploying US troops.\n\n\"We're going to have a presence in Venezuela as it pertains to oil,\" Trump said in a Saturday press conference at Mar-a-Lago in reply to a question about whether the US military would have a presence there. \"So you may need something, not very much.\"\n\nVenezuela has one of the world's largest proven oil reserves, but deploying US troops to guard its oilfields and aging infrastructure comes with high risks and costs, military experts told Business Insider, and will require a stable security environment. This kind of operation may also require congressional authorization or additional funding.\n\n\"When you put US troops into a foreign country, there is going to be some resistance unless they are invited,\" said Peter Mansoor, a retired US Army colonel and professor of military history at the Ohio State University who is an expert in counterinsurgency warfare.\n\nMansoor, who commanded a brigade in Iraq, said US operations there are instructive, showing why sending US troops into Venezuela is the \"least desirable\" option. Iraqis themselves guarded their energy infrastructure, he said, which proved quite vulnerable to attack during the insurgency: Pipelines were bombed, mortars struck an oil refinery, trucks were hijacked only to have the oil sold on black markets.\n\n\"All of those things happened in Iraq, and they could happen here too if the Venezuelans allow an insurgency to erupt,\" said Mansoor, who is also a senior fellow at the Mershon Center for International Security Studies at OSU.\n\nMuch of Venezuela's operations are now managed by the state-run PDVSA oil company that took on assets that had belonged to US companies. Of US oil majors, only Chevron remains.\n\nVenezuela's future production is as murky as its tar-like extra-heavy crude. This type of oil is a large part of its massive oil reserves and requires a crude upgrader process to make it easier to move, an industry analyst said.\n\n\"All of that requires a lot of upfront investment,\" said Ben Cahill, an energy analyst at the University of Texas at Austin. \"So the Venezuelan oil sector presents some particular challenges. The reserves are enormous, and under the right political transition, and if a different investment regime returns, it is an opportunity that will be attractive to some companies.\"\n\nTo be sure, the US military has plenty of experience with energy infrastructure. Soldiers have patrolled near oil fields in eastern Syria. Warships and cutters guarded oil platforms off Iraq during the war and intercepted oil smugglers. A US task force more recently escorted ships, including tankers, threatened by missile and drone attacks in the Red Sea.\n\nAny US military mission in Venezuela turns on a turbulent situation where it's unclear who's in charge; Trump said at the press conference that US officials would be \"running\" Venezuela for a time.\n\n\"What's unclear here is who is actually the opponent,\" said Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. \"Do we think we're going to have to send troops to go in and seize these oil fields rather than simply having the government of Venezuela change its model for managing them? At this point, it's unclear what exactly the protection is from and who would be doing it.\"\n\n\"So jumping ahead to say that the US military is going to now be protecting a bunch of oil facilities is premature,\" Clark said.\n\nOne thing that makes this national discussion so unusual is that it's so nakedly about oil access, unlike the stated justifications for the Persian Gulf war or the 2003 Iraq invasion.\n\n\"The Trump administration has been very open about oil, even though they've tried to position this a little bit in terms of human rights,\" said Paul Poast, an associate professor of political science at the University of Chicago and a resident fellow at the Chicago Council of Global Affairs. \"What remains to be seen is how much planning went into the aftermath — which of course the US has a terrible track record with.\"",

    "fullText": "Hours after a dramatic military operation ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro from power and removed him from the country Saturday, President Donald Trump said the United States would “run” Venezuela at least temporarily and tap its vast oil reserves to sell to other nations.\n\nU.S. operations on Saturday represented America’s most assertive action to achieve regime change in a country since the nation’s 2003 invasion of Iraq. The actions raise stark new questions about the legality of the U.S. moves under a broader campaign against the South American nation.\n\nThe middle-of-the-night seizure of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who were being transported on a U.S. warship to face narco-terrorism conspiracy charges in New York, is beyond even the most high-profile historical examples of aggressive American actions toward autocratic governments in Panama, Iraq and beyond, legal experts said. It came after a surprise U.S. incursion into the Venezuelan capital, rocked with overnight explosions early Saturday.\n\nThe Trump administration described the operation — and earlier deadly strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea — as necessary to stem the flow of dangerous drugs.\n\nProtesters gather in Los Angeles, elsewhere to protest US military action\n\nHundreds gathered in the rain in downtown Los Angeles to protest the U.S. military action in Venezuela.\n\nPeople donning raincoats and holding umbrellas carried signs saying “Stop bombing Venezuela now!” and “No blood for oil” as they listened to speakers. One person held a handwritten sign saying “No War! No Trump!”\n\nA smaller group of about 50 people protested in Las Vegas.\n\nAftermath of US military operation in Venezuela disrupts Caribbean travel\n\nThe U.S. military operation that captured Maduro and flew him out of the country has also disrupted Caribbean travel at a busy travel time for the region.\n\nElisia Cohen had planned to return from her family vacation in Puerto Rico on Friday but a mechanical issue grounded their Delta flight back to Minneapolis. Then, the University of Minnesota professor woke up before dawn Saturday to the news of the strikes on Venezuela and the delay, then cancellations of all flights.\n\n“I hope this will not become a nightmare of airspace not opening up,” she said.\n\nShe spent most of Saturday trying to rebook a flight back to anywhere in the continental United States, and even though she succeeded, she said she won’t truly stop worrying until the airspace reopens and flights start taking off again.\n\nU.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a social media post that “the FAA restricted the airspace in the Caribbean and Venezuela to ensure the SAFETY of the flying public.”\n\n“When appropriate, these airspace restrictions will be lifted,” he said. “Please work with your airlines directly if your flight has been impacted.”\n\n▶ Read more about travel disruptions here\n\nVenezuelans wonder who’s in charge as Trump claims contact with Maduro’s deputy Rodríguez\n\nUncertainty gripped Venezuela on Saturday as people scrambled to understand who was in charge of the South American country.\n\nTrump delivered a shocking pick for who would take control: The United States, perhaps in coordination with one of Maduro’s most trusted aides.\n\nDelcy Rodríguez has served as Maduro’s vice president since 2018, overseeing much of Venezuela’s oil-dependent economy as well as its feared intelligence service. But she is someone the Trump administration apparently is willing to work with, at least for now.\n\n“She’s essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again,” Trump told reporters of Rodríguez, who faced U.S. sanctions during Trump’s first administration for her role in undermining Venezuelan democracy.\n\nTrump indicated that Rodríguez had been sworn in already as president of Venezuela, per the transfer of power outlined in the constitution. However, state television has not broadcast any swearing-in ceremony.\n\nIn her televised address, Rodríguez did not declare herself acting president or mention a political transition. A ticker at the bottom of the screen identified her as the vice president. She gave no sign that she would be cooperating with the U.S.\n\n“What is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,” she said. “History and justice will make the extremists who promoted this armed aggression pay.”\n\n▶ Read more about the reaction within Venezuela\n\nMaduro’s ouster sparks celebrations among Venezuelans in South Florida\n\nRevelers chanted “liberty” and draped Venezuelan flags over their shoulders in South Florida to celebrate Maduro’s capture and removal from the country.\n\nFor some Venezuelan natives, the military action — culminating months of stepped-up U.S. pressure — brought their dreams of reuniting with loved ones closer to reality after years of heartbreaking separations.\n\nPeople gathered for a rally in Doral, the Miami suburb where Trump has a golf resort and where roughly half the population is of Venezuelan descent.\n\nOutside El Arepazo restaurant, a hub of the Venezuelan culture of Doral, one man held a piece of cardboard with “Libertad” scrawled with a black marker. It was a sentiment expressed by others hoping for a new beginning for their home country as they chanted “Liberty! Liberty! Liberty!”\n\n“We’re like everybody — it’s a combination of feelings, of course,” said Alejandra Arrieta, who came to the U.S. in 1997. “There’s fears. There’s excitement. There’s so many years that we’ve been waiting for this. Something had to happen in Venezuela. We all need the freedom.”\n\nBlack lawmakers in Congress condemn ‘illegal’ US actions in Venezuela\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus is blasting Trump over U.S. actions against Maduro, calling the operation “a grave and illegal abuse of power.”\n\n“While Nicolás Maduro is, in fact, an illegitimate leader, the deployment of U.S. military power to impose political change in a sovereign nation — without the consent of Congress or a clear and defined plan of action — threatens to draw the United States into an indefinite conflict in Venezuela,” the caucus said in statement.\n\n“We cannot understate the severity of the consequences that could follow from such reckless actions, which threaten regional stability and weaken our standing on the world stage,” the lawmakers said.\n\nPerson in custody seen gingerly leaving plane believed to be carrying Maduro\n\nAt around 5:25 p.m., a person in custody was escorted out of the plane believed to be carrying Maduro.\n\nThe person gingerly made his way down a stairway one step at a time, then was led across the tarmac surrounded by a crowd of at least three dozen federal agents.\n\nSeveral agents in the crowd appeared to film the person on their phones.\n\nCanadian PM stands by Venezuelan people’s sovereign right to build future\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says his government welcomes the opportunity for freedom, democracy and prosperity for the Venezuelan people.\n\nCarney notes in a post on a social media that Canada has not recognized the “illegitimate regime of Maduro since it stole the 2018 election.” He says Canada has long supported a “Venezuelan-led transition process that respects the democratic will of the Venezuelan people.”\n\nCarney is calling on all parties to respect international law and says Canada stands by the “Venezuelan people’s sovereign right to decide and build their own future.”\n\nSeizing control of Venezuela’s oil presents legal issues for US, law professor says\n\nMatthew Waxman, a Columbia University law professor who was a national security official in the George W. Bush administration, said seizing control of Venezuela’s resources opens up additional legal issues.\n\n“For example, a big issue will be who really owns Venezuela’s oil?” Waxman wrote in an email. “An occupying military power can’t enrich itself by taking another state’s resources, but the Trump administration will probably claim that the Venezuelan government never rightfully held them.”\n\nBut Waxman, who served in the State and Defense departments and on the National Security Council under Bush, noted that “we’ve seen the administration talk very dismissively about international law when it comes to Venezuela.”\n\nJUST IN: Plane carrying deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro arrives in New York following his capture by US, AP source says German leader calls for stability in Venezuela\n\nChancellor Friedrich Merz said in a statement Saturday that Nicolás Maduro led Venezuela to disaster and noted that Germany, like many other countries, didn’t recognize his presidency after the South American nation’s last election.\n\nMerz said that a legal classification of the U.S. intervention is “complex” and “we will take time” on the matter.\n\nHe said that political instability must not arise in Venezuela now and that it’s important to ensure “an orderly transition to a government legitimized by elections.”\n\nSchumer says Trump actions in Venezuela ‘reckless’\n\nThe Senate Democratic leader said, “The idea that Trump plans to now run Venezuela should strike fear in the hearts of all Americans.”\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer of New York said the Trump administration had assured him multiple times it was not pursuing regime change or taking military action in Venezuela.\n\n“Clearly, they are not being straight with Americans,” he said.\n\nRubio hints Cuba could be next after Trump takes Maduro out of Venezuela\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio is hinting that Cuba could be the next target of the Trump administration’s push to restore American dominance in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nRubio said he would be a bit concerned if he were a Cuban government official following the overnight U.S. military operation in Venezuela that captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife. “If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I’d be concerned at least a little bit,” said Rubio, who has had a long preoccupation with both Venezuela and Cuba.\n\nThe U.S. has had a long history of military interventions in Latin America, including its tacit support for the unsuccessful 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion led by Cuban exiles aimed at toppling Fidel Castro.\n\nVenezuela's UN ambassador says his country has right to self defense\n\nIn a letter sent to the U.N. Security Council on Saturday, the Venezuelan ambassador to the U.N. warned that in light of the U.S. strikes, the country “reserves the inherent right to self defense.”\n\nThe letter from Ambassador Samuel Reinaldo Moncada Acosta, obtained by AP, goes on to request an urgent meeting of the 15-member council and condemnation and cessation of U.S. actions.\n\n“What began more than four months ago as a police fantasy is now showing its true face: this is a colonial war aimed at destroying our republican form of government, freely chosen by our people, and at imposing a puppet government that allows the plundering of our natural resources, including the world’s largest oil reserves,” Acosta wrote.\n\nTrump says Venezuelan vice president Delcy Rodríguez sworn in as president\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump claimed that Venezuelan vice president Delcy Rodríguez had been sworn in as president shortly before he spoke to reporters and added she had spoken with Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\n“She is essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again. Very simple,” Trump said.\n\nEarlier, opposition leader María Corina Machado said that the opposition candidate Edmundo González should assume power, saying that he rightfully won the 2024 presidential election.\n\nTrump shares photo of captured Maduro\n\nThe president posted a photo on social media showing Maduro wearing a sweatsuit and a blindfold with the caption: “Nicolas Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima.”\n\nMaduro appeared to be wearing a flotation device around his neck. Next to him was someone wearing a jacket that had a DEA logo.\n\nMaduro also had protective headphones on his ears and appeared to be lifting a water bottle with both arms to drink.\n\nTrump’s action against Maduro contrasts with clemency granted to ex-Honduras leader\n\nTrump’s dramatic action against Maduro is the polar opposite of the clemency he granted to former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández.\n\nTrump in December pardoned Hernández though he was sentenced to 45 years in U.S. prison for helping drug traffickers to safely move hundreds of tons of cocaine north through his country to the U.S.\n\nHernández, who enjoyed support from officials in the first Trump administration, was convicted by a U.S. jury in New York — which Maduro is now set to face.\n\nWhen asked in an interview with Politico about the pardon, Trump said, “I don’t know him” and “I know very little about him,” but added that he was told that Hernández “was set up.”\n\n“The country, uh, deals in drugs, like probably you could say that about every country, and because he was the president, they gave him like 45 years in prison,” he said.\n\nJustice Department released a new indictment of Maduro and wife\n\nThe indictment accuses Maduro of leading a “a corrupt, illegitimate government that, for decades, has leveraged government power to protect and promote illegal activity, including drug trafficking.” It alleges that the drug trafficking efforts “enriched and entrenched Venezuela’s political and military elite.”\n\nU.S. authorities allege that Maduro partnered with “some of the most violent and prolific drug traffickers and narco-terrorists in the world” to bring tons of cocaine into the U.S., according to the indictment.\n\nAuthorities estimate that as much as 250 tons of cocaine were trafficked through Venezuela by 2020, according to the indictment. The drugs were moved on go-fast vessels, fishing boats and container ships or via planes from clandestine airstrips, authorities allege.\n\nUN is ‘deeply alarmed’ by the US strike\n\nThe United Nations said it was “deeply alarmed” by the U.S. strikes and reported detention of President Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela. It expressed concern that the escalation was a violation of international law.\n\n“These developments constitute a dangerous precedent,” Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, said in a statement. Dujarric said the U.N. worried about the larger implications for Latin America and the Caribbean and called on “all actors in Venezuela” to respect human rights and the rule of law.\n\nChina slams US strike in Venezuela\n\nChina strongly condemned the U.S. strike in Venezuela and the action against its president, the Foreign Ministry said, adding the Beijing government was “deeply shocked” and firmly opposed to the operation.\n\n“Such hegemonic acts of the U.S. seriously violate international law and Venezuela’s sovereignty and threaten peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean region,” it said.\n\nIt called on the U.S. to comply with international law and the principles of the U.N. Charter, urging it to stop violating the sovereignty and security of other nations.\n\nTrump says a helicopter was hit and ‘a few’ US members were injured in Venezuela\n\nTrump said a helicopter was hit during the operation in Venezuela and a few U.S. members were injured, but he believed none were killed.\n\n“A couple of guys were hit, but they came back and they’re supposed to be in pretty good shape,” he said.\n\nHe said the U.S. lost no aircraft in the operation.\n\n“We got it all back. One of them was hit pretty hard but—a helicopter—but we got it back.\n\n“We had to do it because it’s a war,” he added a few moments later.\n\nTrump dismisses criticism he did not seek congressional permission for Venezuela strike\n\nTrump brushed off criticism from U.S. Democratic lawmakers that he did not seek permission from Congress ahead of time and that the strike was illegal. He called his Democratic critics “weak, stupid people” and blaming his political opponents for inflation in the U.S.\n\nHe said the operation in Venezuela was “really genius.”\n\n“All they do is complain,” he said of the Democrats.\n\n“They should say, ‘Great job.’ They shouldn’t say, ‘Oh Gee, maybe it’s not constitutional.’ You know, the same old stuff that we’ve been hearing for years and years and years,” Trump said.\n\nTrump says he proposed to the Mexican president that US take out cartels\n\nTrump said the operation in Venezuela “wasn’t meant to be” a message to Mexico, but then he has proposed to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum that the U.S. “take out” cartels in her country and suggested the U.S. might take action.\n\n“We’re very friendly with her, she’s a good woman. But the cartels are running Mexico. She’s not running Mexico. The cartels are running Mexico,” Trump said.\n\nHe said he’s asked Sheinbaum numerous times, “Would you like us to take out the cartels?” but she has said no.\n\n“Something’s going to have to be done with Mexico,” Trump said.\n\nTrump says US will decide on what’s next for Venezuela\n\nPresident Donald Trump said in an interview Saturday morning that the United States will be making decisions on what is next for Venezuela after capturing the Latin American country’s president and flying him out of the country.\n\n“We’ll be involved in it very much” as to who will govern the country, Trump said.\n\n“We can’t take a chance in letting somebody else run and just take over what he left, or left off,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News hours after the capture.\n\nMaduro was at his home when he was seized in US operation, party leader tells AP\n\nVenezuelan ruling party leader Nahum Fernández told The Associated Press that Nicolás Maduro and his wife were at their home within the Ft. Tiuna military installation when they were captured.\n\n“That’s where they bombed,” he said. “And, there, they carried out what we could call a kidnapping of the president and the first lady of the country.”\n\nEuropean leaders react to Maduro’s capture by the US\n\n— EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas wrote on X that she had spoken with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the EU ambassador in Caracas. “The EU has repeatedly stated that Mr Maduro lacks legitimacy and has defended a peaceful transition. Under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN Charter must be respected. We call for restraint.”\n\n— Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called for “de-escalation and responsibility. International Law and the principles of the United Nations Charter must be respected,” Sánchez wrote on X.\n\n— Russia’s Foreign Ministry said it is “extremely alarmed” and called for “immediate clarification,” according to a statement posted Saturday on the ministry’s Telegram channel. The ministry said such actions, if confirmed, would constitute “an unacceptable infringement on the sovereignty of an independent state.”\n\n— British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the U.K. was not involved in the U.S. operation in Venezuela and that he would seek more information from Trump. Without condemning the U.S. action, Starmer said he always believes that international law should be upheld. “But I think at this stage, fast moving situation, let’s establish the facts and take it from there,” he said.\n\nUS indicted Maduro on narcoterrorism charges in 2020\n\nThe Justice Department during Trump’s first term in office charged in the several indictments that Maduro had effectively converted Venezuela into a criminal enterprise at the service of drug traffickers and terrorist groups as he and his allies stole billions from the South American country.\n\nThe coordinated unsealing of indictments against 14 officials and government-connected individuals, and rewards of $55 million for Maduro and four others, attacked all the key planks of what then-Attorney General William Barr called the “corrupt Venezuelan regime,” including the Maduro-dominated judiciary and the powerful armed forces.\n\nOne indictment by prosecutors in New York accused Maduro and socialist party boss Diosdado Cabello, head of the rubber-stamping constitutional assembly, of conspiring with Colombian rebels and members of the military “to flood the United States with cocaine” and use the drug trade as a “weapon against America.”\n\nRead our news report from 2020 on the charges\n\nRussia calls US action ‘an act of armed aggression’\n\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry condemned what it called a U.S. “act of armed aggression” against Venezuela in a statement posted on its Telegram channel Saturday.\n\n“Venezuela must be guaranteed the right to determine its own destiny without any destructive, let alone military, outside intervention,” the statement said.\n\nThe ministry called for dialogue to prevent further escalation and said it reaffirmed its “solidarity” with the Venezuelan people and government, adding that Russia supports calls for an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting.",

    "title": "What the top US general revealed about how the surprise 'Absolute Resolve' raid to capture Maduro unfolded in Venezuela",
    "description": "Operation Absolute Resolve involved over 150 military aircraft, including fighter jets, helicopters, drones, and bomber planes.",
    "fullText": "More than 150 US military aircraft participated in the operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, including fighter jets, drones, bombers, and helicopters, the top US general said on Saturday.\n\nDan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the \"audacious\" mission to extract Maduro — called \"Absolute Resolve\" — required months of meticulous planning and rehearsal, and involved forces from across the US military.\n\nCaine, speaking in Florida alongside President Donald Trump and other senior administration officials, said the US intelligence agencies spent months trying to find Maduro and map out various elements and patterns of his life. There were also detailed rehearsals, including the building of a replica of Maduro's compound, an approach the US applied to the 2011 Osama bin Laden raid.\n\nThere were limits to what Caine could share, but he was still able to provide substantial detail.\n\nShortly before 11 p.m. ET on Friday night, after waiting several days for favorable weather, Trump ordered US forces to proceed with the extraction operation.\n\nCaine said that during the \"darkest hours\" of the night, aircraft launched from 20 different bases, on land and at sea, across the Western Hemisphere.\n\nHelicopters carrying the US apprehension teams, including law enforcement officers and special operations forces, took off and flew to Venezuela, flying around 100 feet above the water.\n\nAs they approached the shores, military forces established a path forward, while Marine, Navy, and Air Force planes protected them from above. The US targeted Venezuelan military installations and defenses. Trump also shared that the military effectively turned off the lights using \"certain expertise.\" The darkness aided the infiltration.\n\nThe American aircraft included a mix of F-35 and F-22 stealth fighter jets, as well as F/A-18 fighter jets, EA-18 electronic attack jets, E-2 airborne early warning planes, B-1 bombers, and other unnamed support aircraft, as well as \"numerous\" drones, Caine said.\n\nAs the interdiction forces out to bag Maduro approached Caracas, the aircraft began to strike Venezuela's air defenses to ensure a safe passageway for the helicopters flying at low altitudes. Trump acknowledged that US military action had been telegraphed in advance, so the air defenses were ready. They were, however, met with a significant response.\n\n\"Those in the air over Caracas last night were willing to give their lives for those on the ground and in the helicopters,\" Caine said of the planes providing air cover.\n\nUS strikes and other layered effects, Caine said, helped ensure the forces pushing into downtown Caracas had \"totally the element of surprise.\"\n\nThe helicopters carrying the extraction team arrived at Maduro's compound shortly after 1 a.m. ET and took heavy fire. The apprehension force stormed the facility and took the Venezuelan president and his wife into custody. Trump said that they attempted to make it into a steel safe room but were unable to get the door closed.\n\nAmerican forces then withdrew from the country, with fighters and drones covering the exfiltration. By roughly 3:30 a.m. ET, US forces were over the water.\n\nThey flew Maduro and his wife to the amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima. Trump later published a photo of the Venezuelan president aboard the ship, where he was seen wearing a blindfold and ear protection while holding a bottle of water.\n\nUS officials said that there were no equipment or troop losses; however, Trump said earlier that \"a couple of guys were hit\" during the raid. The Pentagon and White House did not respond to questions for additional details on injuries to American personnel. A helicopter was also hit \"pretty hard,\" Trump said, but it remained flyable.\n\nThe scale and coordination of what Trump called a \"very complex\" operation resemble those of the June 2025 strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities, which also involved dozens of US military aircraft, with officials underscoring the key element of surprise.\n\nThe US established a significant military presence in the Caribbean Sea in recent months, including warships and aircraft. Troops, planes, and other assets have been very active, and the Trump administration has been repeatedly threatening to strike Venezuela, accusing the country's leadership of facilitating drug trafficking, among other criminal activity. Maduro rejected these claims.\n\nThe US has carried out dozens of strikes against alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, killing more than 100 people in a campaign that drew criticism from legal experts and lawmakers. The US stopped short of hitting targets inside Venezuela, at least until a recent CIA operation.\n\nThe significant operation on Saturday marks a major escalation and throws into question the future of Venezuela's leadership. Trump said the US is going to \"run the country\" until it can ensure a safe transition of power, while also encouraging American oil companies to become involved in the Venezuelan oil industry.\n\nMeanwhile, Attorney General Pamela Bondi said Maduro has been indicted in the Southern District of New York and charged with various drug-related offenses.",

    "description": "New imagery obtained by Business Insider shows widespread damage at a military complex in the southern part of Caracas.",
    "fullText": "New satellite imagery shows damage at a military facility in Caracas after the US carried out strikes as part of a surprise operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nThe new imagery, captured on Saturday by the US spatial intelligence firm Vantor and obtained by Business Insider, shows damage around the Venezuelan military complex at Fuerte Tiuna in the southern part of Caracas.\n\nFuerte Tiuna is a critical military installation in Venezuela. It houses defense ministries and major commands, official residences, and other major strategic infrastructure. It was a primary target of the US mission.\n\nThe new imagery reveals significant damage to military storage buildings and equipment at the complex, including several vehicles, as well as destroyed security buildings at a gate to the facility.\n\nPresident Donald Trump revealed earlier on Saturday that the US carried out a highly complex raid to capture Maduro and extract him from the country to face drug-related charges in New York. The White House in August had placed a $50 million bounty on his head.\n\nThe bold operation began late Friday night and continued into the early hours of the next day, with US military aircraft — including fighter jets, surveillance planes, bombers, and drones — striking Venezuela's air defenses to clear a path for apprehension forces to locate Maduro.\n\nVenezuela's government said US forces targeted military and civilian areas and strongly condemned the strikes. Video footage shared on social media showed helicopters above Caracas, with large explosions and plumes of smoke rising from the city.\n\nDan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters in Florida that the apprehension team, which included US law enforcement officers, broke into Maduro's fortified compound under heavy fire and took the Venezuelan president and his wife into custody.\n\nSeveral American personnel were injured in the raid, Trump revealed, and one helicopter took a hit. However, no one was killed, he said, and the US didn't lose any equipment. Maduro was flown to the US Navy amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima ahead of his transfer to New York.\n\nThe mission — dubbed \"Operation Absolute Resolve\" — followed months of escalating tensions between Trump and the Maduro regime and dozens of US military strikes against alleged narcotics-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.\n\nPrior to the mission, the US had established a large military presence around the Caribbean, and Trump had repeatedly threatened to pursue targets in Venezuela.\n\nCaine said that the audacious operation involved months of meticulous planning and rehearsal. That included building a replica of Maduro's compound, similar to what US special operations forces did ahead of the 2011 Osama bin Laden raid.\n\nThe operation on Saturday marks a significant escalation in the Trump administration's pressure campaign, which also saw the US seize Venezuela-linked oil tankers while imposing a naval blockade targeting sanctioned vessels.\n\nThe strikes raise questions about the future of Venezuela's leadership. Trump said the US will run the country\" until it can ensure a safe transition of power, although it's unclear how Washington will do that.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has been encouraging American oil companies to become involved in the Venezuelan oil industry.\n\nSome world leaders have reacted strongly to the operation, including some from countries near Venezuela, who criticized the mission. They were joined by some Democratic US lawmakers. Many Republicans voiced their support.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio explained to reporters in Florida on Saturday that the Trump administration did not notify Congress ahead of the operation and only informed members afterward. The president defended the decision.",

But they came back, and they're supposed to be in pretty good shape,\" Trump said.\n\n\"We lost no aircraft; everything came back — we got it all back. One of them was hit pretty hard — a helicopter — but we got it back,\" the president added.\n\nThe Pentagon referred questions about Trump's comments to the White House, which did not immediately respond to a request for additional information.\n\nTrump earlier said the US had carried out a large-scale strike against Venezuela, capturing Maduro and his wife and flying them out of the country. The operation, he said, was done in coordination with American law enforcement.\n\nAttorney General Pamela Bondi said Maduro has been indicted in the Southern District of New York and charged with various drug-related offenses. \"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" she added.\n\nVideo footage shared on social media showed helicopters flying low to the ground in Venezuela. Caracas said American forces targeted military and civilian areas and strongly condemned the strikes.\n\nSpeaking on Fox, Trump said that the US \"turned off almost all of the lights in Caracas.\" He described the raid as being \"very organized,\" with American forces working under near total darkness.\n\nHe declined to say which American forces participated in the raid. He said only that they're \"the most highly trained soldiers in the world,\" adding that \"there's nobody that has their talent.\"\n\nHe said the operation was planned with \"pinpoint\" accuracy, and that the US \"built a house which was identical to the one they went into\" — a tactic similar to what the US did ahead of the 2011 raid on Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan.\n\nThe US has built up a massive military presence in the Caribbean Sea in recent months, gathering advanced warships, fighter jets, and an aircraft carrier, with the White House repeatedly threatening military action against Venezuela. He accused the country's leadership of facilitating drug-trafficking — claims Maduro rejected.\n\nUS forces have carried out dozens of strikes against alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, killing over 100 people, and seized multiple Venezuela-linked oil tankers in the region.\n\nLast month, US media reported that the CIA carried out a drone strike inside Venezuela, marking the first known operation in the country since Trump's pressure campaign began. At that time, it was unclear whether he intended to escalate further.\n\n\"We were going to do this four days ago, but the weather was not perfect,\" Trump said of the operation to capture Maduro during his interview with Fox on Saturday. \"We had just the perfect weather.\"\n\nThe president later said that the US is going to be strongly involved in Venezuela's oil industry moving forward.\n\nSeveral leaders of countries in the region quickly condemned the strikes in Venezuela. Democratic US lawmakers blasted the Trump administration for the operation, while some Republicans voiced their support.",

    "fullText": "A Ukrainian military leader on Putin’s hit-list conned the Kremlin out of $500,000 by faking his own death to collect the bounty, Kyiv revealed on Thursday.\n\nDenis Kapustin, a far-right military commander and founder of the Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC), a battalion of far-right Russians who fight for Ukraine against Putin, was reported to have been killed in a drone strike in Zaporizhia on December 27 after spending months atop the Kremlin’s most wanted list.\n\n“We will definitely avenge you, Denis,” the RVC wrote in a Telegram post ‘confirming’ Kapustin’s death. “Your legacy lives on.”\n\nBut in a stunning twist, Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) revealed on Thursday that the assassination of Kapustin, 41, had instead been part of an elaborate hoax cooked up by Kyiv to save the militia leader’s life and trick Russia into paying them a half-a-million dollar bounty that had been placed on his head.\n\n“Welcome back to life,” HUR chief Kyrylo Budanov announced in a video on January 1, congratulating Kapustin on bamboozling the Kremlin.\n\n“First of all, Mr. Denis, congratulations on your return to life. That is always a pleasure. I am glad that the money allocated for your assassination was used to support our struggle,” he said. “I wish us all and you personally success.”\n\nBudanov, who described Kapustin as a “personal enemy” of Vladimir Putin, said the plot had taken more than a month to organize and that the commander would promptly return to the frontlines to continue his duties after swindling the Kremlin out of its cash.\n\nKapustin, better known by his callsign of ‘White Rex,’ also confirmed his role in the plot and said his “temporary absence” had not affected his unit’s effectiveness on the battlefield.\n\n“I am ready to move to the area of operations and continue commanding the RDK,” he said.\n\nFormed in 2022, the RVC was one of several international brigades composed of dissident Russians who took up arms against Putin and played a key role in cross-border excursions into Russia’s Belgorod and Kursk regions in 2023 and 2024.\n\nBut Kapustin, who has been formally named a terrorist by the Russian government, has long been considered a controversial ally to Ukraine due to his association with several neo-Nazi and far-right groups, which saw him banned from entering almost the entire European Union, including France, Germany, Italy and Spain, in 2019 because of his extremist views.\n\nThe RVC describes its members as holding “conservative views and traditionalist beliefs” but has denied accusations of neo-Nazism, instead claiming their goal is to establish a “true nation-state for Russians” that “lives in peace with the nations that surround it.”\n\n“I have my set of views, it’s a patriotic set of views, it’s a traditionalist set of views, it’s a right-wing set of views,” Kapustin told Al Jazeera in 2023.\n\n“You’ll never find me waving a flag with a swastika, you’ll never find me raising my hand in a Hitler sign. So why would you call me that?”",

Ostensibly, Roberts wants his stroll down memory lane to emphasize this coming summer’s semiquincentennial.",

    "description": "Camp Hero, a former military base, has been plagued by conspiracy theories about the so-called \"Montauk Project,\" which inspired \"Stranger Things.\"",
    "fullText": "As a huge \"Stranger Things\" fan, I'm officially mourning the end of my beloved show.\n\nIf you're like me and need a \"Stranger Things\" fix to help ease the pain, you can pay a visit to the real abandoned base that inspired one of Netflix's biggest franchises.\n\nWhile the interdimensional problems that have befallen our friends in Hawkins, Indiana, are completely fictional, the series is based on a real-life New York town called Montauk and its government Air Force station, which has been at the center of multiple conspiracy theories for decades — Montauk even got a name-check in the series finale.\n\nUnsubstantiated claims include that researchers at the base had repressed the memories of employees who'd been subjected to experiments throughout the '70s and '80s.\n\nToday, it's possible to visit the station, now called Camp Hero, and after checking it out in 2023, I can confidently say it's still one of the creepiest places I've ever visited.\n\nI came away understanding where the Duffer brothers, who created \"Stranger Things,\" got their inspiration for the creepy Hawkins Lab and the psychedelic experiments that go on inside.\n\n\"Stranger Things\" began as the story of a group of pre-teens who, after one of their best friends goes missing, become tangled in a dangerous web of government conspiracies, alternate dimensions, the Cold War, and more.\n\nSince its debut in 2016, the show has become a phenomenon, spawning millions of dollars in merch, tie-in novels and comics, a stage adaptation, mobile games, a tabletop game, at least one animated spinoff, and more.\n\nOne of the show's breakout characters is Eleven (played by Millie Bobby Brown), a young girl born with telekinesis. Immediately after her birth, she was abducted by a scientist whom she calls Papa (Matthew Modine) and taken to Hawkins Lab, where she and other children were experimented on.\n\nThe show wrapped up its fifth and final season on December 31.\n\nIn 2016, Matt and Ross Duffer confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter that \"Stranger Things\" was originally sold as \"Montauk\" before they decided to switch the name and the location to the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana.\n\n\"We liked Montauk, because we liked the coastal setting,\" Matt Duffer said, adding that Montauk was also the basis for Amity Island, the fictional location of \"Jaws,\" one of their favorite movies.\n\nHowever, the setting changed when they realized \"it was really going to be impossible to shoot in or around Long Island in the wintertime,\" Matt Duffer said.\n\nFilmmaker Charlie Kessler, sued the brothers in 2018, claiming they stole the idea of \"Stranger Things\" from his script \"The Montauk Project,\" Thrillist reported. The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the Duffers denied his claims, and Kessler dropped the lawsuit in 2019.\n\nSpoiler for the series finale: Montauk even got referenced by name in the last episode, when Hopper mentioned that a friend mentioned that the town was looking for a new sheriff.\n\nAccording to signs in the park outlining Camp Hero's history, the US Army commissioned Camp Hero in May 1942 — five months after the US joined World War II in December 1941 — to defend against German submarines and boats.\n\nThe Army deactivated the base in 1947 and turned it over to the US Air Force in 1951, which remained there until 1982.\n\nCamp Hero, named for Major General Andrew Hero Jr., who served as the chief of coast artillery from 1926 to 1930, according to Arlington National Cemetery, opened to the public in 2002.\n\nMontauk is commonly known as The End. It's the last town on Long Island, making it the perfect spot for an Army base scanning the oceans for submarines hiding in the depths below.\n\nAs a huge fan of \"Stranger Things\" with a mild interest in secret governmental conspiracy theories, I figured I'd drive out east and laugh with my mom (who made the trek with me) about the wildest things we'd learn about Camp Hero.\n\nInstead, I came away feeling like \"Stranger Things\" got the atmosphere of this place exactly right.\n\nI'm from a town on Long Island 99 miles west of Montauk, so it took me around two hours to drive there.\n\nWhen there's no traffic, it can be a fun drive. You pass through picturesque towns worth a stop, like Amagansett, East Hampton, Southampton, Wainscott, and more.\n\nCurbed reported that celebrities including Julianne Moore, Ralph Lauren, and Robert De Niro have owned real estate in the town.\n\nI grew up on Long Island and have been to Montauk dozens of times, but I'd never explored Camp Hero before.\n\nMontauk Lighthouse, according to the Montauk Historical Society, was the first lighthouse to be built in New York after George Washington commissioned it in 1792. Today, it's a Long Island landmark that is part of the adjacent Montauk Point State Park.\n\nIt's also the fourth-oldest working lighthouse in the US and just one of 12 lighthouses to be named a National Historic Landmark.\n\nOr, if you're a New York resident with an Empire Pass like I am, it's free.\n\nAccording to New York State's Parks Department, the Empire Pass \"permits unlimited vehicle access to most facilities operated by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.\"\n\nEssentially, it gets you into most New York state parks for free. A card costs $80 per year (or $72 a year for a digital card), or you can purchase a lifetime pass for $750 (or $742 for a digital card). Three-season and five-season passes are also available, as shown on the parks' website.\n\nAs my family members are big fans of Jones Beach, another state park, we've had an Empire Pass for as long as I can remember.\n\nI was surprised to learn that a decent chunk of land is off-limits to visitors and is a wildlife and plant sanctuary.\n\nThere are a few parks in the Montauk area that offer a good view of the bluffs, including Shadmoor State Park, Montauk Point State Park, and Ditch Plains Beach.\n\nThis wouldn't be the last warning sign I'd see that day.\n\nErosion is also a huge problem on Long Island's beaches. The Patch reported that the town of East Hampton, which includes Montauk, was given a $350,000 federal grant to address the erosion issues along the coastline in December 2022.\n\nOfficials told The Patch that, according to measurements by the US Army Corps of Engineers, Montauk's shoreline \"eroded more than 44 feet inland between 2000 and 2012.\"\n\nIn the years since, the erosion has only continued, so I heeded the sign's warnings and stayed as far back as possible.\n\nThe radar tower looms over Camp Hero. I knew I needed to make my way over there to get a good look.\n\nMore about those conspiracy theories later.\n\nAccording to signs in the park, the Army built batteries throughout the base. Batteries 112 and 113, which are both still standing, contained two 16-inch guns each. The artillery was removed in 1947.\n\nEven from a distance, you can see just how big it is.\n\nBeing up close was somehow even more unsettling.\n\nAccording to signs in the park, the \"giant\" radar, specifically an AN/FPS-35, was built in 1960, and it remained operational until 1980.\n\nIts radar dish was built to detect an attack on the US. As The New York Times reported in 2006, it was once \"able to detect airborne objects more than 200 miles from shore.\"\n\nAt the peak of the Cold War, multiple towers were located throughout the eastern US, but now, the Montauk tower is the only one left.\n\nThe radar tower is central to many of the conspiracy theories surrounding Camp Hero.\n\nFilmmaker Christopher Garetano, who directed a docudrama about Camp Hero called \"Montauk Chronicles\" in 2014, spoke about the radar dish during a History Channel documentary called \"The Dark Files.\"\n\n\"Every 12 seconds the radar tower would rotate and there would be animals freaking out and people getting headaches and bad dreams,\" says Garetano in \"The Dark Files,\" claiming \"people's electronic equipment would go haywire\" when the dish rotated.\n\n\"I don't want to add fuel to the fire because I don't believe all the zombie stuff,\" one resident of 40 years told The New York Post in 2020. \"But the impact that tower had on the town was real. I don't know if it affected our thoughts like some people say, but it was a force.\"\n\nTicks are frequent carriers of Lyme disease. That was more than enough to keep me away from any heavily wooded areas.\n\nThe New York Times reported in 2006 that visitors to Camp Hero were given pamphlets about what to do in case they spotted an undetonated grenade or other unexploded ammunition — it did use to be an active military base, after all.\n\nAt first, I scoffed, but as the day went on, I started to see what she meant.\n\nIt was spookily silent as we walked through the woods, even though we weren't too far from the beach or a busy highway. I felt like we were in the middle of nowhere.\n\nAs you can see, it looks like we were just about to walk into a heavily wooded forest.\n\nIn the first episode of \"Stranger Things,\" Mike, Lucas, and Dustin search the woods for their friend Will after he goes missing while biking home. The trio are searching on a rainy night when they suddenly come across Eleven, who had just escaped Hawkins Lab.\n\nAt the end of season one, Eleven returns to the woods to escape the lab's clutches.\n\nThis rock was helpfully in the perfect place for me to pose for a photo.\n\nFishing is one of Camp Hero's biggest draws, and I saw a few fishermen on the beach casting their lines.\n\nHe was just a friendly pet running back to his owner, but safe to say, we were both on edge.\n\nI didn't even have the presence of mind to take a picture of this dog — that's how you know my mom and I were truly freaked out.\n\nThis building used to be a gymnasium.\n\nThe sign in front explained more about downtown Camp Hero. When the base was built in 1947, 600 men and 37 officers lived in this area, and the structures were disguised as a \"seaside fishing village,\" with artificial wood siding and fake windows.\n\nThe gym was designed to look like a church. It's the only structure left from the original \"downtown\" Camp Hero, though other newer buildings are still standing.\n\nI was half-convinced that someone was just going to pop out of the windows if I got too close.\n\nWe didn't want to scare the deer away, so we kept our distance while exploring the buildings.\n\nAccording to a comprehensive summary of the conspiracy theories surrounding Camp Hero written by Thrillist in 2016, the events that conspiracy theorists claim happened in Camp Hero were actually pretty similar to what happens in \"Stranger Things.\"\n\nAuthor Preston Nichols brought the theories into the mainstream when he published 1992's \"The Montauk Project: Experiments in Time,\" which detailed his reported experiences working at Montauk Air Force Station — he claimed he'd recovered repressed memories of his time at the base in the '70s and '80s.\n\nNichols said he worked with another former employee on something called the \"Montauk Chair,\" which used electromagnets to strengthen psychic powers. In season four of \"Stranger Things,\" Eleven uses something similar to recover her powers.\n\nNichols also said scientists at the base used abducted children (like Eleven and her \"siblings\") to perform experiments on, and that some were even sent to an unknown dimension (like the Upside Down).\n\nEventually, these experiments were shut down when one of the children summoned an interdimensional monster, Nichols wrote — just like Eleven bringing the Demogorgon to our world.\n\nJoe Loffreno told the Post in 2020 that he believes he's one of the children who were abducted and experimented on and who were mentioned in \"The Montauk Project.\"\n\n\"I didn't believe it until two years ago,\" Loffreno said. \"I was hypnotized [by a certified hypnotist] for about 40 minutes and all these memories flooded back. They did a very bad thing to us out there. We were just little kids. They had no right to experiment on us. It was a very dark, very evil thing.\"\n\nGaretano, director of \"Montauk Chronicles,\" spoke with Newsday in 2017 about the reported tunnels. He said that when the History Channel was filming for \"The Dark Files,\" they found proof that the tunnels existed.\n\n\"Something extraordinary was found, which goes against all the official statements that there isn't anything there,\" Garetano said. \"We didn't get into them, but we have footage of them that was taken by someone else.\" He added that they saw something on the \"electric resistivity imagery tests\" that were conducted.\n\nAnother local, Paul Fagan, told the New York Post that he believes a nuclear reactor might've secretly been buried at the base in the '50s, and that any conspiracy theories are actually meant to distract from the reactor's existence.\n\nThe New York Department of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider about the claims.\n\nThe Army and the Air Force have never appeared to go on the record about the claims either, and they did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider either.\n\nWhen the Army built the base, it was used to surveil the surrounding area for German submarines, and it was also an antiaircraft artillery training station. At the time, according to the sign, all antiaircraft units in New York were sent to Camp Hero for a few weeks to train.\n\nThe sign also said it was home to other surveillance and height-finding radar that \"guarded the New York City area against a surprise attack by Soviet bombers or other missiles.\"\n\nThe base was also used \"extensively\" as a live-fire training range until it was shut down in the '80s.\n\nThere are no lights and very little signage — I could see myself getting hopelessly lost in the woods.\n\nDo I really believe that there were scientists using abducted children to contact a different dimension at Camp Hero?\n\nHowever, I understand the fascination with Camp Hero — the fact that the radar tower and other disguised buildings are still standing decades later, the secluded location, and the idea that there could be secret tunnels underground are all compelling fodder for urban legends.\n\nAnyone interested in military history or conspiracy theories would learn a lot at Camp Hero, and I'd recommend visiting — but only during the day, and not on your own.\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published in August 2023 and was most recently updated in January 2026.",

    "description": "The UK military expected to see more high-end Russian equipment, like T-14s and Su-57s, in Ukraine, an officer said. They're not there though.",
    "fullText": "A British Army officer said that the military was surprised it did not see more advanced Russian weaponry, like some of its best tanks, on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\n\"We probably would've expected to have seen more of their prestige equipment,\" Maj. Maguire told Business Insider, speaking on the condition that only his rank and last name be used. He previously helped lead the UK-led training for Ukrainian soldiers and also produced reports for the UK and allies on tactics in Ukraine and the lessons Western forces could draw from them.\n\nOne example he gave of Russian equipment that hasn't been seen is the T-14, considered Russia's most advanced tank.\n\nThat kind of warfighting equipment is what the British military sort of sees as \"the pacing threat equipment that we train against.\"\n\nThe T-14, estimated to cost between $5 million and $9 million, is regarded as one of Russia's best tanks. Western analysts had worried the tanks might rival NATO's most advanced tanks. Russian state media has often touted the Armata as \"cutting edge.\"\n\nYet these weapons haven't been seen in the war. Sergei Chemezov, the CEO of Rostec, which produces the Armata, previously said the tanks might not be well-suited for Ukraine.\n\n\"Armata is, in general, a little expensive,\" he said. \"In terms of functionality, it is, of course, much superior to existing tanks, but it is too expensive, so the army is unlikely to use it now.\"\n\nThe UK expected this kind of prestige equipment, but instead these tanks \"haven't really been used, and I think that's probably more surprising than the fact that they've used a lot of their stockpiles and stuff,\" Maguire said.\n\nThe Russians have relied heavily on tanks like T-90s and T-80s, as well as some decades-old equipment, some first deployed in the 1940s. It has been pulling old tanks out of storage rather than putting its most capable assets, at least on paper, out onto the battlefield.\n\nIts stores are vast, with numerous tanks built for a Cold War fight, and building new tanks is a long process, even with Russia's ramped-up defense industry output. Sophisticated machinery takes time to build, and the Western sanctions at crippling the industry don't make it any easier.\n\nMaguire did not speculate on why Russia is not using the T-14, but the UK Ministry of Defence has previously weighed in.\n\nIt said last year that the Armata's absence was \"highly likely due to the potential reputational damage of losing the 'prestige' vehicle in combat and the requirement to produce greater quantities of MBTs which can only be satisfied by other variants.\"\n\nAn earlier ministry intelligence update that Russian troops in Ukraine were reluctant to accept the first tranche of T-14s that were offered to them \"because the vehicles were in such poor condition.\"\n\nRussia's confidence in the tank is unclear; however, it notably reduced its own order for the tanks, instead focusing on modernizing older types. Western analyses say the tank is impressive but also appears to be more vulnerable than Russia has said.\n\nThe war has not been kind to tanks and other armored vehicles. It is a fight in which neither side has achieved air superiority and cheap drones and mines threaten anything that moves. Considering the substantial losses, cost-effective mass has often proven more valuable than exquisite combat power.\n\nBeyond the T-14, Russia also hasn't sent in its fifth-generation fighters, its Su-57s. These aircraft are built for this kind of war, where air defenses make the skies extremely dangerous for older fourth-gen jets. Russia hasn't made the progress it hoped for in Ukraine, yet these planes are still largely sitting out the fight.\n\nThe UK defense ministry said in 2023 that the Su-57's usage seemed limited to Russian territory and launching long-range air-to-surface or air-to-air missiles into Ukraine. It said Russia was \"highly likely prioritising avoiding the reputational damage, reduced export prospects, and the compromise of sensitive technology which would come from any loss\" of the jet over Ukraine.\n\nQuestions have been raised about the Su-57 stealth and combat capabilities, with some speculation that it may not be a true fifth-gen aircraft. A former UK air force officer turned analyst previously told Business Insider that Russia was likely saving them for a possible conflict with NATO.\n\nWhen it comes to the high-level equipment Russia isn't using, Maguire said, \"I have no idea why they're not using it, but I'm pretty sure whatever it is, we could defeat it with what we have.\"\n\nRussia has put some advanced systems into the war; however, the few weapons that have made an appearance haven't \"performed very well,\" the major said.\n\nHe pointed to Ukraine's destruction of Russia's newly developed BMPT \"Terminator\", a 23-foot-long armored vehicle carrying a host of weapons. Ukraine has also been able to shoot down the Kinzhal missiles Russia boasted were unstoppable with Patriots, and Russia's S-400 air defense system, while still formidable, has somewhat underperformed.\n\nRussia's military in general has underperformed compared to Western expectations, including in its failure to quickly overpower Ukraine, which has left it bogged down in a grinding fight in the east. NATO officials also say the quality of its military has degraded throughout the war, though others have noted its learning too, making it a threat the West is watching closely.",

    "fullText": "Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro said Thursday that his government is open to negotiating an agreement with the United States after months of American military pressure targeting drug trafficking networks tied to his government.\n\nIn a pre-taped interview with Spanish journalist Ignacio Ramonet that aired on state television, Maduro said Venezuela is \"ready\" to discuss a drug-trafficking deal with the U.S. He called on the countries to \"start talking seriously, with data in hand.\"\n\n\"The U.S. government knows, because we’ve told many of their spokespeople, that if they want to seriously discuss an agreement to combat drug trafficking, we’re ready,\" he said. \"If they want oil, Venezuela is ready for U.S. investment, like with Chevron, whenever they want it, wherever they want it and however they want it.\"\n\nChevron Corp. is the only major U.S. oil company currently exporting Venezuelan crude to the United States.\n\nMaduro Trapped With Few Retaliation Options After Trump Admin Seizes Venezuelan Oil Tanker\n\nMaduro said the U.S. wants a regime change in Venezuela and access to its oil reserves through a monthslong pressure campaign that began with a major military deployment to the Caribbean Sea in August.\n\nHe said it is clear the U.S. wants \"to impose themselves through threats, intimidation and force.\"\n\nThe interview was recorded on New Year’s Eve, the same day the U.S. military announced a kinetic strike that killed five people aboard two vessels operated by designated terrorist organizations involved in narcotics trafficking.\n\nSen. Kennedy Doubles Down On Venezuela Crackdown, Urges Sanctions To 'Choke Off' Funds\n\nAt least 114 people have been killed since the U.S. began bombing alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific in early September.\n\nThe U.S. may be signaling a possible expansion of its Venezuela-focused campaign, including potential ground operations.\n\nPresident Donald Trump confirmed that a strike last week targeted what he described as a Venezuelan port used for drug trafficking, but declined to say whether the operation was carried out by the U.S. military or another entity, such as the CIA.\n\nSouthcom Says 8 Narco-terrorists Killed In Latest Eastern Pacific Lethal Kinetic Strikes\n\nMaduro declined to comment on that strike during the interview, but said he could \"talk about it in a few days.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has intensified pressure on Maduro, ordering a total blockade of oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuela, designating his regime a foreign terrorist organization and accusing it of using stolen U.S. assets to fund terrorism, drug trafficking and other criminal activity.\n\nU.S. authorities have also seized two ships carrying sanctioned oil.\n\nFox News Digital's Greg Wehner, Morgan Phillips, Jasmine Baehr and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article",

Beijing had expressed anger at a planned U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, as well as at Japan’s new leader’s comments that Tokyo could intervene in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan.\n\nChina sees Taiwan as its own territory and threatens to annex it by force if necessary. A former Japanese colony, Taiwan has been governed independently from the mainland since 1949, when the Nationalist Party lost a civil war against the Chinese Communist Party and retreated to the island.\n\nLai's speech was met angrily in Beijing, where a spokesperson for the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office called the president “a saboteur of peace, a troublemaker and a warmonger,” according to the official Xinhua news agency.\n\n“No matter what Lai and the Democratic Progressive Party authorities say or do, they cannot change the fact that Taiwan is part of China,\" said spokesperson Chen Binhua.\n\nThe planned arms sale, valued at more than $11 billion, is the U.S.’s largest so far to Taiwan. It includes missiles, drones, artillery systems and military software.\n\nThe United States is obligated by its own laws to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.\n\nChina’s leader Xi Jinping called Taiwan’s eventual annexation “ unstoppable \" during his own televised New Year’s address on Wednesday.\n\nTaiwan last year announced a special $40 billion budget for arms purchases, including to build an air defense system with high-level detection and interception capabilities called the Taiwan Dome.\n\nThe budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033, and comes after Lai already pledged to raise defense spending to 5% of the island’s GDP, as part of his strategy amid China’s threats of invasion.\n\n“Facing China’s serious military ambitions, Taiwan has no time to wait,” Lai said.\n\nMistreanu reported from Beijing.",

    "description": "Our free college football picks expect Texas State to flaunt their class vs. Rice in the Armed Forces Bowl. Free Rice vs. Texas State predictions for January 2, 2026.",
    "fullText": "The last day of bowl season kicks off on Tuesday morning in Fort Worth, TX, as the Rice Owls face the Texas State Bobcats in the Armed Forces Bowl at Amon G. Carter Stadium.\n\nRice is one of three 5-7 teams featuring in a bowl game, and my Rice vs. Texas State predictions believe the Owls are up against it, facing a quality Texas State team that is better than its 6-6 record indicates.\n\nRead on for my college football picks for Friday, January 2.\n\nTexas State will win this game and move to 7-6. The Bobcats suffered many close and heartbreaking defeats this season, but they’re still a solid team headed in the right direction under G.J. Kinne. This isn’t the kind of squad that has any business flirting with a losing record, whereas Rice is guaranteed to finish below .500.\n\nThe Rice Owls arrive in bowl season thanks to their APR Score and not anything that they’ve done on the football field. They clawed their way to five wins, but Scott Abell’s squad still has a lot of work to do before it can be considered a quality football team.\n\nThe Texas State Bobcats, on the other hand, have much more impressive metrics than you’d expect from a 6-6 team playing in the Group of 5.\n\nThe offense ranks Top 10 in EPA per play, led by star quarterback Brad Jackson (3,742 total yards, 34 TDs), workhorse running back Lincoln Pare (1,328 scrimmage yards, 13 TDs), and star receivers Beau Sparks and Chris Dawn Jr. (combined 2,044 yards, 11 TDs) behind a quality offensive line.\n\nThat potent unit will be close to full strength for this bowl game with no announced opt-outs as of December 31. They should exploit a beatable Rice defense that allowed more explosive plays than any other team in the country and checks in at 118th in EPA per play.\n\nOn the flip side, Rice will be without starting quarterback Chase Jenkins, and perhaps two of its top skill position players (wideout Drayden Dickmann and running back Daelen Alexander).\n\nThis unit was already bad (114th in success rate) and wants to keep the ball on the ground (fourth in rush rate), which might prove difficult against a Texas State defense ranking 55th in rush defense grade per PFF.\n\nThis is one of the highest totals we’ve seen in a Rice game all season, so my natural inclination is to bite the bullet and play the Under. The Owls play at a very slow pace (118th in snaps per minute) and simply aren’t built to play from behind or get into a shootout, which the game script calls for.\n\nThe defense will give up plenty, but that probably happens early in the ball game. Kinne will simply want to get his team out of Fort Worth with a victory, and can likely do so by a sizable margin even if he has his team cool the jets in the second half.\n\nSpread: Rice +14.5 | Texas State -14.5\n\nMoneyline: Rice +560 | Texas State -800\n\nOver/Under: Over 56.5 | Under 56.5\n\nRice is 2-5 ATS in its last seven games.

    "fullText": "NUR SHAMS REFUGEE CAMP, West Bank (AP) — Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank watched as Israeli military bulldozers pulled down their homes Wednesday as part of a nearly year-long incursion into the territory's northern refugee camps.\n\nThe scene in Nur Shams has been repeated often across the northern West Bank in the roughly 11 months since Israeli troops launched operation “Iron Wall” there in early 2025. During that time, the military has demolished or heavily damaged at least 850 structures across the refugee camps of Nur Shams, Jenin and Tulkarem, according to an analysis of satellite imagery by Human Rights Watch.\n\nTroops have also forced out the camps' populations, leading to the largest displacement in the West Bank since Israel captured the territory in 1967. Tens of thousands of residents are living with relatives, cramming into rental apartments or living in public buildings.\n\nIsrael says the operation aims to root out armed groups and says the demolitions are needed to destroy militant infrastructure or to clear routes for troops.\n\nIsrael has said its troops will stay in some camps for a year, and its unclear when, if ever, Palestinians will be able to return.\n\nRights groups and Palestinians say the raids are destroying homes. AP video showed bulldozers tearing down several houses out of a total of 25 the military said it planned to demolish.\n\n“Our home is dear to us, the memories are dear to us, the family, the neighbors, and the good people are dear to us,” said Motaz Mohor, whose home was set to be destroyed as he watched the bulldozers. “The first time our grandparents were displaced, and this is the second time.”\n\nHis grandparents had moved to Nur Shams after their original displacement from the cities of Jaffa and Haifa during the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation, when some 700,000 Palestinians were expelled from their homes by forces of the nascent state or fled as troops advanced, an event Palestinians call the Nakba, or “catastrophe.”\n\nMohor said he was sheltering with roughly 25 of his relatives in a 100-square-meter (1,070-square-foot) apartment after being displaced from the camp.\n\nThe military said troops had allowed residents to get their belongings from homes beforehand. It said it had only taken down structures where there existed a “a clear and necessary operational need” and after examining alternate courses of action.\n\nThe military said the camp was still an area of militant activity even almost a year after the start of the operation and that troops had located explosives in the camp within the last month.\n\nAhmed al Sayyes, 60, said his home was also slated for demolition. He was surprised to wake up and see the bulldozers beginning work.\n\n“It’s very difficult and painful,” he said. He said the house where he is sheltering is for sale and he'll have to leave it. “It’s a tragedy after tragedy. Very difficult. Only God knows where we will end up.”",

    "fullText": "TOKYO (AP) — Japan is barreling forward with efforts to significantly boost its military capabilities to stand up to China’s growing threats by doubling annual arms spending. The goal comes as Tokyo’s main ally, the United States, pushes for more military assistance in Asia and a military hawk and ultra-conservative takes over Japan's leadership.\n\nJapan says it is still a peaceful nation and the buildup is necessary for a more self-reliant military that can better deter China. But Beijing and other critics see Japan as deviating from its postwar peace pledge, pointing to Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's statement soon after taking office that any Chinese military action against Taiwan could be grounds for a Japanese military response.\n\nJapan’s transformation into one of the world’s major defense spenders has developed over decades and raises the question of whether the ongoing buildup is a violation of its pacifist constitution.\n\nJapan’s constitution has been hollowed out\n\nAfter World War II, Japan was not supposed to have a military.\n\nDuring the 1945-1952 U.S. occupation, American officials wanted to stamp out the militarism that led to Japanese aggression across Asia before and during the war.\n\nUnder Article 9 of the U.S.-drafted 1947 constitution, Japan renounced the use of force to settle international disputes, and the right to maintain land, sea and air forces for that purpose.\n\nThe U.S. changed its mind about Japanese militarism when the Korean War started in 1950. Japan became an ally, not a threat, leading to the creation of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces in 1954. Article 9 is now widely seen as the legal basis for Japan to have a sufficient military to defend itself.\n\nJapan has since repeatedly stretched the definition of self-defense, allowing overseas dispatches of its troops as part of international peacekeeping operations, though mostly avoiding combat missions.\n\nA big change came in 2014, under former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who wanted Japan to have a normal military. Abe newly interpreted Article 9 as legalizing collective defense. The following year, a security law allowed Japan to use force if the United States or other friendly nations come under enemy attack, even if Japan is not being attacked.\n\nThis was Abe’s attempt to have a normal military without formally changing the constitution.\n\nTakaichi angered China by giving a hypothetical example of such a situation, a deviation from former leaders’ strategic ambiguity.\n\nThe flap with Beijing escalated in December when Chinese aircraft locked their radars, considered possible preparation for firing missiles, on Japanese planes during Chinese aircraft carrier drills near southwestern Japan.\n\nTwo Chinese aircraft carriers also were spotted in June operating near the southern Japanese island of Iwo Jima for the first time. This led to worry in Tokyo about Beijing’s rapidly expanding military activity far beyond its borders and in areas around islands claimed by both countries.\n\nTakaichi’s Cabinet last week approved a record defense budget plan. It exceeds 9 trillion yen ($58 billion) for the coming year and aims to fortify its strike-back capability and coastal defense with cruise missiles and unmanned arsenals.\n\nIn Beijing later that day, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian criticized the Takaichi government for accelerating the pace of its military buildup and expansion, and added: “Japan is deviating from the path of peaceful development it has long claimed to uphold and is moving further and further in a dangerous direction.”\n\nChina, which spends a huge amount on its own defense, may also see Takaichi as a defender of Japanese wartime aggression. Before taking office, she was a regular at Tokyo’s Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japan’s 2.5 million war dead, including convicted war criminals. Victims of Japanese aggression, especially China and the Koreas, see visits to the shrine as tantamount to a lack of remorse about Japan’s wartime past.\n\nTakaichi stayed away from Yasukuni in 2025 and sent a religious ornament marking the Aug. 15 anniversary of Japan’s defeat as a personal gesture instead of praying at the shrine.\n\nJapan takes on more offensive roles\n\nA fundamental change came in December 2022 when former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s government adopted a security strategy stating the need for Japan to acquire strike-back capability with long-range missiles, a major break from Japan’s self-defense-only policy.\n\nThe strategy names China as Japan’s biggest strategic challenge and calls for a more offensive role for Japanese troops under its security alliance with the U.S as the allies work more closely together.\n\nMasahiro Sakata, former head of the Cabinet Legislative Bureau, described the move as “the death of Article 9.”\n\nAfter the war, Japan long prioritized economic development over defense while relying largely on the U.S. by hosting about 50,000 American troops who also serve the region.\n\nJapan maintained a defense spending cap of 1% of GDP until the annual defense budget started to rise under Abe’s nearly decade-long leadership, to about 1.1%. Takaichi is certain to achieve a 2% target by March, two years earlier than planned, and is expected to push for more spending in coming years as Japan is under growing pressure after NATO adopted a new target of 5%.\n\nJapan plans to promote defense industry\n\nTakaichi’s revised security and defense policy would aim to further bolster Japan with unmanned combative weapons and long-range missiles. It is expected to scrap remaining restrictions on arms exports to promote the development of Japan’s defense industry and cooperation with friendly nations.\n\nJapan has long banned arms exports but has significantly eased restrictions in recent years and is now developing next-generation fighter jets with the UK and Italy while finalizing a deal to sell frigates to Australia. Japan also will to provide support for construction and maintenance for U.S. warships.\n\nA government-commissioned panel has proposed Japan consider developing a nuclear submarine to achieve a more long-distance deterrence capability, a controversial idea for a country that has long maintained non-nuclear principles.\n\nJapan has requested Washington ensure protection through the extended deterrence of nuclear weapons. A number of officials recently expressed support for Japan’s nuclear possession, which has led to criticism from Japanese atomic bomb survivors and other pacifist groups.\n\nJapan stands by its three non-nuclear principles of not possessing, not producing and not allowing its presence, according to Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, although he said Japan is considering all options for a possible new submarine.",

    "fullText": "Our reporting revealed a symbiotic relationship between the IDF and Silicon Valley – with implications for the future of warfare\n\nIn January this year, Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham first reported that Microsoft had deepened its ties to Israel alongside other major tech firms. Since then, the Guardian has published an award-winning series of investigations – in partnership with the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and the Hebrew-language outlet Local Call – that has revealed a symbiotic relationship between Silicon Valley and the Israeli military.\n\nOne investigation exposed an Israeli mass surveillance program scooping up virtually all Palestinian phone calls and storing them on Microsoft’s cloud services – setting off an inquiry that ultimately prompted the company to cut off Israel’s access to some of its technology. Another story revealed that the Israeli military created a ChatGPT-like tool to analyze data collected through the surveillance of Palestinians. Yet another revealed that Google and Amazon had agreed to extraordinary terms to clinch a lucrative contract with Israel.\n\nI asked Davies and Abraham to discuss what they learned this year – about the role of these technologies in Israel’s assault on Gaza, whether these business ties are sustainable, and what the revelations tell us about how the wars of the future will be fought.\n\nHow did Israel’s relationships with these companies change after October 7?\n\nYuval Abraham: The Israeli military had been fetishizing artificial intelligence and big data for many years – a trend that is very much connected to Israel’s occupation of the Palestinians, because the occupation generates a lot of data. What changed after October 7 was the scope. The military was looking to bomb hundreds of targets every day in Gaza. Tens of thousands of people were recruited into reserve duty. That meant a huge spike in usage of technological systems. That’s where the big tech companies stepped in.\n\nHarry Davies: There was a huge surge in demand – not just for the storage capacities of the tech companies, but also for the products that they offer to analyze the information used to prosecute a war. What’s valuable for the military is the way in which these services are able to provide what’s known as “blob storage”, which allows them to store and process infinite amounts of raw intelligence information.\n\nWhat has made Israel such an appealing market for these companies?\n\nYuval Abraham: As we reported, the Israeli army has been collecting Palestinian phone calls for a long time. But when you want to collect the phone calls of an entire population every day, and you want to retain those phone calls for long periods of time, you need a lot of storage room and processing power.\n\nIf you remember the [Edward] Snowden revelations, many of them had to do with metadata, which doesn’t weigh a lot. But the Israeli military also wanted to store mass audio files, images or videos – and for that it felt it needed the assistance of companies like Microsoft. In the West Bank, sources have told us this information has been used to find dirt on people to blackmail them. In the Gaza Strip, we know that this massive trove of intercepted phone calls was also used in airstrikes that killed civilians.\n\nSo data is power and data is control. And these American cloud providers allow the Israeli military to store a lot of data and to sift through it very effectively. That has direct consequences for people on the ground.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories. Messages are end to end encrypted and concealed within the routine activity that every Guardian mobile app performs. This prevents an observer from knowing that you are communicating with us at all, let alone what is being said.\n\nIf you don’t already have the Guardian app, download it (iOS/Android) and go to the menu. Select ‘Secure Messaging’.\n\nTo send a message to Harry and Yuval please choose the ‘UK Investigations’ team.\n\nYou can message Harry using the Signal Messenger app. Use the ‘find by username’ option and type hfd.90\n\nIf you don’t need a high level of security or confidentiality you can email harry.davies@theguardian.com\n\nSecureDrop and other secure methods\n\nIf you can safely use the tor network without being observed or monitored you can send messages and documents to the Guardian via our SecureDrop platform.\n\nFinally, our guide at theguardian.com/tips lists several ways to contact us securely, and discusses the pros and cons of each.\n\nHarry Davies: Yossi Sariel, the former head of [Israel’s elite spy agency] Unit 8200, wrote a book under a pseudonym that we revealed to have been published by him. In that book, he articulated what at the time was a bold and radical vision – as Yuval described, this fetishization of Silicon Valley technology. He recognized the possibilities that the likes of Google, Amazon and Microsoft could afford the Israeli military. Two years before October 7, he said that militaries and governments needed to forge relationships with these companies that are similar to the relationships they have with companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin. So he was already thinking about these companies as instrumental to war and surveillance in the way that a defense contractor provides components for fighter jets or manufactures bombs and missiles.\n\nSome of our reporting has looked at how elements of his vision have come true and have been put into effect, both before October 7 and afterwards, in both the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nWe know AI is central to Israel’s military operations – its army has developed its own AI capabilities, as you revealed, Yuval, and has also purchased AI tools for use from Microsoft. Why is AI so central to Israel’s broader war aims?\n\nYuval Abraham: What AI did was allow Israel to achieve the effective results of carpet bombing without losing the legitimacy of a data-driven assault with targets and objectives. In Gaza, one way in which the Israeli military used AI was to give a score to almost every person in Gaza who has a phone number, determining how likely it was that person was a member of Hamas or Islamic Jihad. This score was based on a machine-learning algorithm [developed by Israel] called Lavender. It was trained on a dataset of known Hamas members. AI allowed the Israeli military to generate and bomb tens of thousands of military targets, on a scale that without AI would not have been humanly possible. Many of the targets were not Hamas members, according to sources. And Israel for the most part bombed these people not while they were engaged in military activity, but when they stepped inside their families’ homes.\n\nThese AI systems had an error rate that the Israeli military knew about. But to me, the key thing about AI is not the mistakes that it makes. It’s the scale of destruction that it allows militaries to unleash, and it’s a discourse of legitimacy that it enables – a discourse of targets and collateral damage.\n\nAI also seems to me to incentivize mass surveillance, right? Because it allows for the analysis of ever-growing reams of information.\n\nHarry Davies: Signals intelligence agencies have long collected more information than they could humanly process. That served as a kind of restraint on their ability to conduct mass surveillance. I think we’re now seeing a shift where AI allows an intelligence agency like Unit 8200 to make sense of things that previously it struggled to make sense of.\n\nMicrosoft explicitly credited your reporting for changing its policies. Are you seeing any other signs of shifts within the tech industry?\n\nHarry Davies: I think we’re seeing a lot of discomfort and dissent within these companies at both a junior and to some extent senior level. Many employees have been disturbed to find what the products and services that they’re working around the clock to build and market are actually contributing to. There have been protest groups which have emerged from current and former employees within these companies. That’s true across Silicon Valley. I think that played some role in the decision that Microsoft made as a result of our reporting. They were facing a lot of pressure internally.\n\nYuval Abraham: And there’s also a legal question for these companies: if the ICJ [international court of justice] ends up ruling that Israel has committed a genocide, then a follow-up question will be: who contributed to that genocide? Which companies helped maintain it and sustain it? For some people in these companies who are thinking ahead, that could also be a cause for concern.\n\nIt sounds like you think shifts in public support for Israel could actually affect these business relationships.\n\nYuval Abraham: Israel has developed a reliance on these companies for its Nimbus project, which is a huge contract signed between Israel and Google and Amazon back in 2021. It is moving the data of many of its government ministries, along with troves of information from the Ministry of Defense, onto these companies’ cloud servers.\n\nThese are US companies. They’re taking a certain gamble here that the US will stay loyal to Israel and won’t block, limit or sanction them.\n\nMicrosoft only blocked access to technology that was specifically enabling the mass surveillance of Palestinian phone calls – there are still many relationships between Microsoft and the Israeli military. But Microsoft’s action made many people in the Israeli system nervous. It was the first time we know of that a big tech company withdrew services from the Israeli military. It made some people ask whether Israel is making a mistake by giving these foreign companies so much leverage. That question is folded within a larger question of what the US will do, what will happen in 2028 if there’s a more progressive administration in the White House, at a time when so many Americans believe that Israel has committed a genocide in Gaza.\n\nWhat’s your focus going to be in 2026?\n\nYuval Abraham: I think we only uncovered the tip of the iceberg.\n\nHarry Davies: We’re both very conscious that, although we have spent a lot of time working on this, we still just have glimpses inside the system. We’re continuing to build a fuller picture of how this technology was and continues to be used in Gaza and in the West Bank as well.\n\nThere’s good reason to continue paying attention. Militaries pay attention to what other militaries are doing. There is great interest among other western militaries in how Israel prosecuted this war, in how it integrated these kind of technologies.\n\nAnd there are other militaries whose combat systems and processes are already deeply integrated with Silicon Valley tech. Take the American military, for example. Look at what’s happening right now in the Caribbean. Are those operations somehow free of the involvement or reliance on systems and services provided by these companies? I suspect not. We don’t know for sure, but the Pentagon and the US military have very big contracts with all of these companies to provide cloud services. Post-Gaza, we have to look at these relationships and ask: what is the involvement of these companies and their technology in military decisions, in military operations and in warfare more broadly?\n\nYuval Abraham: Much of our reporting is based on whistleblowers, on individuals who are in proximity to power or hold positions of power.\n\nHarry Davies: Our confidential sources have remained confidential and we are always interested in hearing from new people.

    "description": "Ever since a U.S. military cemetery in the southern Netherlands removed two displays recognizing Black troops who helped to liberate Europe from the Nazis, visitors have filled the guestbook with objections.  The move came after U.S.",
    "fullText": "MARGRATEN, Netherlands (AP) — Ever since a U.S. military cemetery in the southern Netherlands removed two displays recognizing Black troops who helped to liberate Europe from the Nazis, visitors have filled the guestbook with objections.\n\nSometime in the spring, the American Battle Monuments Commission, the U.S. government agency responsible for maintaining memorial sites outside of the United States, removed the panels from the visitors center at the American Cemetery in Margraten, the final resting place for roughly 8,300 U.S. soldiers, set in rolling hills near the border with Belgium and Germany.\n\nThe move came after U.S. President Donald Trump issued a series of executive orders ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs. “Our country will be woke no longer,” Trump said in an address to Congress in March.\n\nThe removal, carried out without public explanation, has angered Dutch officials, the families of U.S. soldiers and the local residents who honor the American sacrifice by caring for the graves.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands Joe Popolo seemed to support the removal of the displays. “The signs at Margraten are not intended to promote an agenda that criticizes America,” he wrote on social media following a visit to the cemetery after the controversy had erupted. Popolo declined a request for comment.\n\nThe displays highlighted the sacrifices of Black Americans\n\nOne display told the story of 23-year-old George H. Pruitt, a Black soldier buried at the cemetery, who died attempting to rescue a comrade from drowning in 1945. The other described the U.S. policy of racial segregation in place during World War II.\n\nSome 1 million Black soldiers enlisted in the U.S. military during the war, serving in separate units, mostly doing menial tasks but also fighting in some combat missions. An all-Black unit dug the thousands of graves in Margraten during the brutal 1944-45 season of famine in the German-occupied Netherlands known in the Hunger Winter.\n\nCor Linssen, the 79-year-old son of a Black American soldier and a Dutch mother, is one of those who opposes the removal of the panels.\n\nLinssen grew up some 30 miles (50 kilometers) away from the cemetery and although he didn’t learn who his father was until later in life, he knew he was the son of a Black soldier.\n\n“When I was born, the nurse thought something was wrong with me because I was the wrong color,” he told The Associated Press. “I was the only dark child at school.”\n\nLinssen together with a group of other children of Black soldiers, now all in their 70s and 80s, visited the cemetery in February 2025 to see the panels.\n\n“It’s an important part of history,” Linssen said. “They should put the panels back.\"\n\nThe decision was based on Trump's DEI policies\n\nAfter months of mystery around the disappearance of the panels, two media organizations — the Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA) and online media Dutch News — this month published emails obtained through a U.S. Freedom of Information Act request showing that Trump’s DEI policies directly prompted the commission to take down the panels.\n\nThe White House did not respond to queries from AP about the removed panels.\n\nThe American Battle Monuments Commission did not respond to queries from AP about the revelations. Earlier, the ABMC told the AP that the panel that discussed segregation “did not fall within (the) commemorative mission.''\n\nIt also said that the panel about Pruitt was “rotated” out. The replacement panel features Leslie Loveland, a white soldier killed in Germany in 1945, who is buried at Margraten.\n\nChair of the Black Liberators foundation and Dutch senator Theo Bovens said his organization, which pushed for the inclusion of the panels at the visitors center, was not informed that they were removed. He told AP it is “strange” that the U.S. commission feels the panels are not in their mission, as they placed them in 2024.\n\n“Something has changed in the United States,” he said.\n\nBovens, who is from the region around Margraten, is one of thousands of locals who tend to the graves at the cemetery. People who adopt a grave visit it regularly and leave flowers on the fallen soldier’s birthday and other holidays. The responsibility is often passed down through Dutch families, and there is a waiting list to adopt graves of the U.S. soldiers.\n\nThe locals remember the sacrifices of the Black soldiers\n\nBoth the city and the province where the cemetery is located have demanded the panels be returned. In November a Dutch television program recreated the panels and installed them outside the cemetery, where they were quickly removed by police. The show is now seeking a permanent location for them.\n\nThe Black Liberators is also looking to find a permanent location for a memorial for the Black soldiers who gave their lives to free the Dutch.\n\nOn America Square, in front of the Eijsden-Margraten city hall, there is a small park named for Jefferson Wiggins, a Black solider who, at age 19, dug many of the graves at Margraten when he was stationed in the Netherlands.\n\nIn his memoir, published posthumously in 2014, he describes burying the bodies of his white comrades who he was barred from fraternizing with while they were alive.\n\nWhen Black soldiers came to Europe in the Second World War, ’’what they found was people who accepted them, who welcomed them, who treated them as the heroes that they were. And that includes the Netherlands,″ said Linda Hervieux, whose book “Forgotten” chronicles Black soldiers who fought on D-Day and segregation they faced back home.\n\nThe removal of the panels, she said, “follows a historical pattern of writing out the stories of men and women of color in the United States.\"",

    "fullText": "The satellites were placed into orbit from Russia’s Vostochny Cosmodrome in a multi-payload launch that Iranian officials described as the country’s seventh satellite mission carried out using Russian launch vehicles.\n\n“These satellites were designed and manufactured by Iranian scientists, and both government bodies and the private sector have been involved,” Iran’s ambassador to Russia, Kazem Jalali, said in remarks published ahead of the launch.\n\n“Two of the satellites belong to the government and one belongs to the private sector, and our knowledge-based companies and universities are active in this field.”\n\nJalali said Iran had continued to advance its space capabilities despite international pressure. “Despite all the threats and sanctions that exist, we have something to say in this field.”\n\nIran’s space agency chief, Hassan Salarieh, said the launch reflected what he described as Iran’s standing among a small group of countries with end-to-end space capabilities.\n\n“Iran is among 10 or 11 countries in the world that simultaneously possess the capability to design and build satellites, launch vehicles and the infrastructure for launching, receiving data and processing images,” he said.\n\nSalarieh said Iran aimed to expand both the number and precision of its satellites. “What is necessary for us is increasing the number of satellites, improving their accuracy and quality, and developing different classes of satellites,” he said.\n\nIranian media identified the satellites as Paya, also known as Tolou-3, Zafar-2, and a prototype satellite called Kowsar-1.5. The spacecraft were launched alongside a large cluster of mainly Russian satellites into a sun-synchronous low Earth orbit.\n\nPaya (Tolou-3), built by the Iranian Space Agency, is Iran’s heaviest Earth-observation satellite to date, weighing about 150 kilograms.\n\nIranian officials say it is capable of producing black-and-white images with a resolution of about five meters and color images with a resolution of around 10 meters, and is intended for applications including agriculture, water management, environmental monitoring and disaster assessment.\n\nZafar-2, developed by Iran University of Science and Technology, is also an Earth-observation satellite designed for mapping, environmental monitoring and tracking natural hazards.\n\nKowsar-1.5 combines imaging and internet-of-things capabilities and is aimed primarily at agricultural and farm-monitoring uses, Iranian officials say.\n\nJalali described Iran’s space cooperation with Russia as extensive and said Moscow’s experience had played a key role.\n\n“Russia is advanced in the space field, including satellites, launch vehicles and satellite launches, and we have been able to transfer part of the technology and work together,” he said.\n\nHe also described the Soyuz rocket as highly reliable. “Before Russia’s relations with the West deteriorated, many Western satellites were launched using Soyuz,” Jalali said.\n\nThe launch also carried Russian Earth-observation satellites, internet-of-things platforms and university-built spacecraft, according to launch data, as well as satellites from partner countries including Belarus, Kuwait and Montenegro.\n\nIran says its space program is civilian and focused on scientific and economic goals, but Western governments argue that satellite launch technology overlaps with systems used to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\n“In my view, we are in an all-out war with the United States, Israel, and Europe; they do not want our country to stand on its own feet,” Masoud Pezeshkian said in an interview with the Supreme Leader’s official website.\n\nHe said the current war is worse than the Iraq war in the 1980s. “If one understands it properly, this war is far more complex and more difficult than that war.”\n\n“In the war with Iraq, the situation was clear; they fired missiles, and it was clear where we would strike back. But here, they are now besieging us in every respect, putting us under pressure and in tight corners, creating problems—economically, culturally, politically, and in terms of security.”\n\nPezeshkian made the comments on the eve of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's trip to the United States, where he plans to brief President Donald Trump on options for potential future strikes against Iran, amid concerns that Tehran is rebuilding ballistic missile production facilities and repairing air defenses damaged during the June conflict, according to NBC News.\n\nIsrael has told the United States that the recent Iranian missile drills may conceal preparations for a potential strike, Axios reported last Sunday, one day after Iran International reported unusual Iranian air activity spotted by Western intelligence agencies.\n\nIsraeli Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir raised the issue directly with Brad Cooper, head of US Central Command, warning that recent missile movements could serve as a cover for a surprise operation against the Jewish state.\n\nPezeshkian said on Saturday that Iran is \"stronger than during the 12‑day war\" with Israel in terms of equipment and manpower. \"If the enemy chooses confrontation, they will naturally face a more decisive response.\"\n\nIn June, Israel carried out airstrikes and covert operations against Iranian military and nuclear sites, killing more than 1,000 people including senior officials and nuclear scientists.\n\nIran retaliated by launching hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel, killing at least 33 people, among them an off-duty soldier.\n\nThe United States helped Israel intercept Iranian attacks and later joined the Israeli campaign, bombing three Iranian nuclear facilities on June 22.\n\n“In a joint operation by the IDF and the Shin Bet, Hussein Mahmoud Marshad al-Jawhari, a key operative in the Operations Unit of the Iranian Quds Force, was eliminated,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement posted on X.\n\n\"(al-Jawhari) operated under the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and was involved in terror activities directed by Iran against the State of Israel and security forces,\" the statement added.\n\nThe IDF said he was involved in “advancing terrorist attack plans against the State of Israel in the Syria–Lebanon arena.”\n\nIt added that al-Jawhari was a key operative in Quds Force’s Unit 840, which the IDF described as “the unit that directs and is responsible for Iranian terrorist activity against the State of Israel.”\n\nThe Quds Force, the external arm of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, conducts overseas operations to support allied groups and advance Tehran’s strategic interests.\n\nLebanon’s state news agency had earlier reported that two people were killed when an Israeli drone struck a vehicle near the Syrian border.\n\nA report by Israel Hayom, citing Israeli officials, said al-Jawhari was killed alongside another operative, identified as Majed Qansoua.\n\nA US-backed ceasefire agreed last November halted more than a year of fighting between Israel and Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah and called for the group to disarm.\n\nBoth Israel and Hezbollah have since accused each other of violating the ceasefire.\n\nIsrael has been carrying out strikes in Lebanon on an almost daily basis, which it says are aimed at preventing Hezbollah from rebuilding.\n\nIran, a longtime sponsor of Hezbollah, has rejected international and domestic calls for the group to disarm, arguing that continued Israeli actions justify its armed presence.\n\nOn Wednesday, former Afghan police general Ikramuddin Sari was shot dead by masked assailants near his home in Tehran, according to sources close to him.\n\nHe was attacked alongside an associate near their residence in southern Tehran and died while being transferred to hospital, the sources told Afghanistan International.\n\nSari, a former police commander in Baghlan and Takhar provinces, fled to Iran after the Taliban returned to power in 2021. Reports in recent months had suggested Iranian police had detained and questioned him, though no official explanation was given.\n\nTaliban's 'extraterritorial assassinations'\n\nThe killing follows the September shooting of Maroof Ghulami, a political and military figure close to veteran anti-Taliban leader Ismail Khan. He was killed by gunfire in the religious city of Mashhad.\n\nPeople close to both men have blamed the Taliban for their deaths, according to Afghanistan International.\n\nThe attacks, an Afghan military source said, signal the start of what he described as Taliban “extraterritorial assassinations,” adding that the group has repeatedly threatened to target opponents abroad.\n\nSenior Taliban official Mohammad Nabi Omari has previously said the group could kill opponents outside Afghanistan “with as little as 500 Pakistani rupees,” while Saeed Khosti, a former spokesperson for the de facto Taliban Ministry of Interior, warned two years ago that hundreds of volunteers were ready to target critics overseas.\n\nIranian authorities have remained publicly silent on Sari’s killing. Tehran has also provided no detailed update on the investigation into Ghulami’s death.\n\nIranian police said in September they arrested three suspects in that case but later released two, offering no clarity on affiliations.\n\nA source familiar with the investigation told Afghanistan International that the remaining suspect was a Taliban operative, a comment not confirmed by Iranian authorities.\n\nSari, originally from Kapisa province, was regarded as a professional officer who served as police commander in Nuristan, Baghlan and Takhar, and as an adviser to Afghanistan’s interior ministry.\n\nIn Iran, he acted as an informal representative for former Afghan soldiers, advocating for their rights, opposing deportations and openly criticizing the Taliban.\n\nThe National Resistance Front of Afghanistan (NRF), led by Ahmad Massoud, called on Iran to conduct a “transparent, serious and independent” investigation, describing Sari’s killing as a “targeted terrorist act.”\n\nThe Jamiat-e Islami Afghanistan, led by Salahuddin Rabbani, also condemned the killing and urged Iranian authorities to identify those responsible.\n\nIran, which has handed Afghanistan’s embassy in Tehran and the consulate in Mashhad to the Taliban, has faced growing criticism for failing to protect Afghan dissidents on its soil even as it seeks closer ties with the Taliban-led administration.\n\n“Israel does not have the capacity for an intense war of attrition or for confronting a major power like Iran, and it is clear that another war would not end in 12 days as the previous one did,” Javan wrote in an analysis on Wednesday.\n\nThe 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June 2025 was a brief but intense conflict. It began with extensive Israeli airstrikes on Iranian military and nuclear facilities.\n\nThe United States became militarily involved mid‑conflict. On June 22, US Air Force and Navy forces carried out coordinated strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities – Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan – in an operation codenamed Operation Midnight Hammer, using B‑2 bombers and submarine‑launched missiles, marking the first US offensive against Iranian territory in decades. Iranian forces fired missiles at US assets in Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, after those strikes.\n\nThe conflict ended with a US and Qatari-mediated ceasefire, but it caused significant casualties, infrastructure damage.\n\nIsraeli rhetoric, the paper said, has shifted from threats of decisive victory to language of caution and warnings about the costs of renewed conflict.\n\nAir strikes, according to Javan, failed to halt what it called Iran’s “distributed and self-sufficient” military production. The paper also argued that the previous fighting severely strained Israel’s multilayer missile defense systems.\n\n“Israeli officials are now openly speaking of the ‘real threat’ posed by Iran’s missiles and warning that without preventive action Iran could reach annual production of thousands of missiles,” the paper said.\n\nFocus shifts from battlefield to society\n\nJavan framed the change in tone as evidence that the military option has lost credibility, writing that the inability to control the consequences of war has weakened Israel’s long-standing doctrine of absolute military superiority.\n\n“War in the contemporary world is not merely a military confrontation, but a test of social capacity, political cohesion and national resilience,” the paper wrote, arguing that internal divisions, political strains and reliance on external support limit Israel’s ability to endure a prolonged conflict.\n\nThe article concluded that future confrontation will be shaped as much by narratives and domestic resilience as by missiles and air defenses.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — China's military on Monday dispatched air, navy and missile units to conduct joint live-fire drills around the island of Taiwan, which Beijing called a “stern warning” against separatist and “external interference” forces. Taiwan said it was placing forces on alert and called the Chinese government “the biggest destroyer of peace.”\n\nTaiwan’s aviation authority said more than 100,000 international air travelers would be affected by flight cancellations or diversions.\n\nThe drills came after Beijing expressed anger at what could be the largest-ever U.S. arms sale to the self-ruled territory, and at a statement by Japan’s prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, saying its military could get involved if China takes action against Taiwan. China says Taiwan must come under its rule.\n\nChina's military did not mention the United States and Japan in its statement on Monday, but Beijing's foreign ministry accused Taiwan's ruling party of trying to seek independence through requesting U.S. support.\n\nTaiwan’s Defense Ministry said rapid response exercises were underway, with forces on high alert. “The Chinese Communist Party’s targeted military exercises further confirm its nature as an aggressor and the biggest destroyer of peace,” it said.\n\nBeijing sends warplanes and navy vessels toward the island on a near-daily basis, and in recent years it has stepped up the scope and scale of the exercises.\n\nSenior Col. Shi Yi, spokesperson of China's People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command, said the drills would be conducted in the Taiwan Strait and areas to the north, southwest, southeast and east of the island.\n\nShi said activities would focus on sea-air combat readiness patrol, “joint seizure of comprehensive superiority” and blockades on key ports. It was the first large-scale military drill where the command publicly mentioned one goal was “all-dimensional deterrence outside the island chain.\"\n\n“It is a stern warning against ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces and external interference forces, and it is a legitimate and necessary action to safeguard China’s sovereignty and national unity,” Shi said.\n\nChina and Taiwan have been governed separately since 1949, when a civil war brought the Communist Party to power in Beijing. Defeated Nationalist Party forces fled to Taiwan. The island has operated since then with its own government, though the mainland’s government claims it as sovereign territory.\n\nDrills will continue on Tuesday\n\nChina's command on Monday deployed destroyers, frigates, fighters, bombers and unmanned aerial vehicles, alongside long-range rockets, to the north and southwest of the Taiwan Strait. It carried out live-fire exercises against targets in the waters. Among other training, drills to test the capabilities of sea-air coordination and precise target hunting were conducted in the waters and airspace to the east of the strait.\n\nHsieh Jih-sheng, deputy chief of the general staff for intelligence of the Taiwanese Defense Ministry, said that as of 3 p.m. Monday, 89 aircraft and drones were operating around the strait, with 67 of them entering the “response zone\" — airspace under the force's monitoring and response. The ministry detected 14 navy ships around the strait and four other warships in the Western Pacific, in addition to 14 coast guard vessels.\n\n“Conducting live-fire exercises around the Taiwan Strait ... does not only mean military pressure on us. It may bring more complex impact and challenges to the international community and neighboring countries,” Hsieh told reporters.\n\nMilitary drills are set to continue Tuesday. Taiwan's Civil Aviation Administration said Chinese authorities had issued a notice saying seven temporary dangerous zones would be set up around the strait to carry out rocket-firing exercises from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., barring aircraft from entering them.\n\nThe Taiwanese aviation authority said more than 850 international flights were initially scheduled during that period and the drills would affect over 100,000 travelers. Over 80 domestic flights, involving around 6,000 passengers, were also canceled, it added.\n\nCommercial airlines began to announce dozens of cancellations and delays for domestic routes across Taiwan, particularly ones along islands near China.\n\nThe Chinese command released themed posters about the drills online accompanied by provocative wording. One depicted two shields with the Great Wall alongside three military aircraft and two ships. Its social media post said the drills were about the “Shield of Justice, Smashing Illusion,\" adding that any foreign interlopers or separatists touching the shields would be eliminated.\n\nLast week, Beijing imposed sanctions against 20 U.S. defense-related companies and 10 executives, a week after Washington announced large-scale arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion. It still requires approval by the U.S. Congress.\n\nUnder U.S. federal law in place for many years, Washington is obligated to assist Taipei with its defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China. The U.S. and Taiwan had formal diplomatic relations until 1979, when President Jimmy Carter’s administration recognized and established relations with Beijing.\n\nAsked about the drills, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party has attempted \"to seek independence by soliciting U.S. support and even risk turning Taiwan into a powder keg and ammunition depot.”\n\n“External forces’ attempts to use Taiwan to contain China and to arm Taiwan will only embolden the Taiwan independence forces and push the Taiwan Strait toward a dangerous situation of military confrontation and war,” he said.\n\nThere was no immediate U.S. statement on the drills.\n\nKaren Kuo, spokesperson for the Taiwanese president's office, said the drills were undermining the stability and security of the Taiwan Strait and Indo-Pacific region and openly challenging international law and order.\n\n“Our country strongly condemns the Chinese authorities for disregarding international norms and using military intimidation to threaten neighboring countries.” she said.\n\nTaiwan's Defense Ministry released a video that featured its weapons and forces in a show of resilience. Multiple French Mirage-2000 aircraft conducted landings at an air force base.\n\nIn October, the Taiwanese government said it would accelerate the building of a “Taiwan Shield” or “T-Dome” air defense system in the face of the military threat from China.\n\nThe military tensions came a day after Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an said he hoped the Taiwan Strait would be associated with peace and prosperity, instead of “crashing waves and howling winds,\" during a trip to Shanghai.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump struggled to offer much sympathy for the families of about 100 Americans—many of them U.S. military veterans—who have died fighting in Ukraine.\n\nAn estimated several thousand Americans have volunteered to fight for Ukraine since Russian dictator Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion in 2022, with at least 92 Americans killed as of September, The New York Times reported.\n\nFollowing a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday to discuss a peace deal to end the war, Trump was asked about his message to the families of the fallen Americans.\n\n“The message is so obvious,” he replied. “What a shame. They died in a foreign country. And some are celebrated people, they’re very celebrated. But it’s so sad that a thing like that would happen.”\n\nHe then immediately moved on to the next question.\n\nSocial media users quickly noted that the president hadn’t thanked the fallen for their sacrifice, praised their commitment to freedom and democracy, or even offered his personal condolences.\n\nMany of the Americans who have died in Ukraine were U.S. military veterans.\n\nMike Meoli, 71, was a retired Navy Seal and firefighter who traveled to Ukraine to train medics on the front lines. He was killed in November 2024, ABC 10 News San Diego reported.\n\nNicholas Maimer, 45, was an Army Special Forces veteran and Idaho native who helped train Ukrainian officers. He was killed in May 2023 in an artillery barrage, according to Military.com.\n\nIan Frank Tortorici, 32, was a retired corporal with the U.S. Marines who fought on the front lines. He died in July 2023 after a Russian missile hit a restaurant where he was eating while on leave, Task and Purpose reported.\n\nThe U.S. government has declined to provide aid to American fighters to avoid any suggestion of a direct clash with Russia, which is a nuclear power, the Times reported in September.\n\nBut some social media users argued that Trump’s barely-there compassion for their families wasn’t measured diplomacy—it was reminiscent of the president’s previous comments about Americans who died in combat being “suckers” and “losers.”\n\nDuring a trip to France in 2018, the president said American soldiers who died on French soil during World War I were “losers,” and that U.S. Marines who helped halt the 1918 German advance toward Paris were “suckers” for dying at the hands of the enemy.\n\nThe White House denied reports of the comments, which were revealed by The Atlantic magazine in 2020, but they’re just one example of the president disparaging military veterans and their families.\n\nHe has mocked the late Sen. John McCain’s war injuries, publicly insulted the parents of a 27-year-old soldier who died in a car bombing in Iraq, and privately raged about the funeral costs for a female soldier who was murdered by a male soldier at Fort Hood.\n\nAlthough he failed to offer much comfort Sunday to the families of Americans who have died fighting Russia, Trump did manage to heap praise on the man who started the war.\n\n“Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed,” Trump said, prompting Zelensky to raise an eyebrow. “I was explaining to the president [Zelensky], President Putin was very generous in his feeling toward Ukraine succeeding.”\n\nHe also said he “understands” Putin’s refusal to agree to a ceasefire while a longer-term agreement is being hashed out.\n\n“He feels that look, you know, they’re fighting and to stop, and if they have to start again, which is a possibility, he doesn’t want to be in that position—I understand that position,” Trump said.\n\nPutin bombarded Ukraine with over 100 drones on Christmas Eve and early Christmas Day, killing at least seven civilians.\n\nSunday’s talks were intended to address security guarantees and possible territorial concessions, and while both sides said progress had been made, neither gave any indication that a deal was within reach.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

Credit - Adek Berry—AFP/Getty Images\n\nChina launched extensive military drills near Taiwan on Monday in what it called a “stern warning” against separatist and “external interference” forces after the Trump Administration announced an $11.1 billion arms sale to the island earlier this month.\n\nThe Chinese military’s “Justice Mission 2025” exercises—the first major drills it has held around the island since April—are to include combat-readiness and port-blockade drills, complete with live fire and simulated land and sea strikes, along seven zones across the island, in part to deter outside intervention, China’s Eastern Theater Command announced.\n\nTaiwan has been self-governed since 1949, after Nationalist forces fled to the island following their defeat by Chinese Communist powers. But China has maintained that it has sovereignty over Taiwan and long called for a “reunification” between the smaller territory and the People’s Republic of China.\n\nSenior Col. Shi Yi, spokesperson of the Eastern Theater Command, said the drills were a “stern warning against ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces and external interference forces” and described the military action as a “necessary” move to protect China’s \"sovereignty and national unity.”\n\nTaiwan’s Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said the exercises “further confirm” the Chinese Communist Party’s “nature as an aggressor and the biggest destroyer of peace.”\n\nIn the drills, China is operating dozens of aircraft and drones around the Taiwan Strait, according to the deputy chief of the general staff for intelligence for the Taiwanese Defense Ministry, Hsieh Jih-sheng. More than 100,000 travelers on international flights were set to be affected by the Chinese military’s actions, per the island’s Transport Ministry.\n\nMilitary drills are expected to continue through Tuesday, Taiwan’s Civil Aviation Administration said.\n\nThe exercises come as China has expressed ire over the recent $11.1 billion U.S. arms sale to Taiwan, which includes high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS) and harpoon missile repair related equipment. The U.S. previously approved more than $1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan in November.\n\nLast week, the Chinese foreign ministry enacted sanctions against 20 U.S. defense firms in the wake of the sales, barring companies such as Boeing from doing business with the global superpower. Ten executives for those companies were also barred from entering China or doing business in the country under the sanctions.\n\nThe State Department notified Congress that it had approved the large-scale sale to Taiwan less than two weeks ago, saying that the potential deal “serves U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.\"\n\n“The proposed sale[s] will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance and economic progress in the region,” the department’s statement continued.\n\nTaiwan’s presidential office stated at the time that it was “sincerely grateful” for the announced sale, while China quickly condemned it, asserting that it undermined Chinese sovereignty and security and disrupted peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.",

    "fullText": "CAIRO (AP) — The Saudi-led coalition in Yemen warned Saturday it would immediately respond to any military movements of separatists backed by the United Arab Emirates that undermine de-escalation efforts in the southern region of Yemen, as the United States urged diplomacy.\n\n“Any military movements that violate these efforts will be dealt with directly and immediately in order to protect civilian lives and ensure the success of restoring calm,\" said Brig. Gen. Turki al-Maliki, a coalition spokesman, according to the Saudi Press Agency.\n\nAl-Maliki also accused the Southern Transitional Council, or STC, separatists of “serious and horrific human rights violations against civilians,” without providing evidence.\n\nThis came a day after separatists accused Saudi Arabia of targeting their forces with airstrikes, something not formally acknowledged by the kingdom, whose relations with the UAE have been strained because of STC actions.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement Saturday that his country was “concerned by recent events in southeastern Yemen” and urged restraint and diplomacy to reach “a lasting solution.” He also expressed gratitude “for the diplomatic leadership of our partners, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.”\n\nYemen, engulfed in a civil war for more than a decade, has the Iran-aided Houthis controlling much of the northern regions, while a Saudi-UAE-backed coalition supports the internationally recognized government in the south. However, the UAE also helps the southern separatists who call for South Yemen to secede once again from Yemen.\n\nThe council moved earlier this month into Yemen’s governorates of Hadramout and Mahra and seized an oil-rich region. That had pushed out forces affiliated with the Saudi-supported National Shield Forces, another group aligned with the coalition in fighting the Houthis.\n\nThe coalition now demands the withdrawal of STC forces from the two governorates, with local authorities returning to oversee them, and the handover of their military camps.\n\nRashad al-Alimi, head of Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council, the governing body of the internationally recognized government, said after an emergency meeting late Friday that STC movements posed “serious violations against civilians.”\n\nThe coalition said in its Saturday announcement came at al-Alimi's request to protect civilians in Hadramout.\n\nThe U.N. Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen said Saturday that it's closely following developments in Hadramout and Mahra, reiterating calls for restraint, de-escalation, dialogues and for all parties to avoid further escalation.",

    "fullText": "Officials with the United Kingdom's Royal Navy are in hot water for pressuring a government agency to conceal information about radioactive pollution.\n\nInvestigative news outlet The Ferret obtained emails in which naval officials urged the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to keep details of the pollution secret. The Ferret made Freedom of Information Act requests in 2019, 2023, and 2024 for files regarding radioactive problems at two naval bases in Scotland. SEPA kept most of the files secret after consulting the Ministry of Defence, which cited national security concerns.\n\nThe decision was reconsidered when The Ferret took the matter to the Scottish Information Commissioner. In June, SEPA was ordered to release the files by July 28. In response, naval and MOD officials engaged in correspondence with SEPA and the commissioner, sending around 130 emails over nine days in an attempt to reverse the decision.\n\nThe Ferret made further FOIA requests to obtain the emails. They showed that naval officials went as far as to threaten legal action against SEPA if the files were released, though what kind is unclear. The MOD was flagged for the matter and called it \"deeply uncomfortable\" but added, \"We have objections but we won't appeal further.\"\n\nThe cover-up was an effort to conceal information about radioactive pollution in Loch Long on the River Clyde in Scotland. When SEPA finally released the files in August, they revealed that the Royal Navy had failed to properly maintain a network of pipes at the Royal Naval Armaments Depot at Coulport, resulting in \"unnecessary radioactive waste.\"\n\nKeeping such information from the public is dangerous, especially when it comes to health. Loch Long is a popular site for water sports, but tourists might think twice about going for a swim if they knew what lurked beneath the surface.\n\nInformation on radioactive waste in Scotland's Loch Long is now available thanks to The Ferret's investigative journalists.

    "description": "The US military has some strange rules for its troops unlikely to be found anywhere else",
    "fullText": "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's crusade against military facial hair is just the latest in a long line of rules you'd struggle to find anywhere else in American life.\n\nSome services ban chewing gum or sipping a drink while walking. However, one particularly strange rule for many troops, even when it's cold out, is no hands in pockets.\n\nThe rules and the strictness with which they are upheld vary among the different service branches. The Marine Corps and Army are among the toughest enforcers.\n\nFor some senior leaders, the restriction on putting hands in pockets is about discipline, uniformity, and maintaining a professional appearance — looking sharp, so to speak. But for service members, the rule can feel impractical and has spawned numerous Reddit threads devoted to the matter.\n\nMarines ban pocketed hands under almost all circumstances when not training, feeling that the look can \"detract from an appropriate military presence,\" according to the Corps' uniform manual. But when training outdoors, \"good judgment\" will govern whether Marines can put their hands in their pockets.\n\nThe Army's uniform regulations ban hands in pockets for any reason other than \"momentarily to place or retrieve objects.\"\n\nThe Navy previously barred sailors from putting their hands in their pockets but reversed course in 2024, allowing them to do so as long as having their hands in their pockets doesn't interfere with safety or saluting. (That same Navy decision also allowed for the return of the obscure Navy tiara.)\n\nThe Air Force has allowed its troops to put their hands in their pockets since 2021. A service news release at the time said the update was part of a broader effort to let troops determine how best to \"maintain standards\" without having commanders and rules \"specifying exact behavior in every situation,\" putting it on service members to figure out what's appropriate.\n\nBeyond guidelines on how service members use their pockets, plenty of other strange rules abound in the armed forces.\n\nUntil 2019, for instance, male Marines were not allowed to use umbrellas while in more formal \"service\" uniforms — women could, but men were expected to embrace the rain like stoic sea captains. Now they can all use umbrellas, unless they're wearing their camouflage utility uniforms, which are worn by the majority daily.\n\nSome troops also aren't allowed to carry gym bags with shoulder straps — those must be carried in one hand, especially with formal uniforms.\n\nMost troops can still travel in their camouflage uniforms, often seen in airports, although they are generally barred from wearing formal uniforms unless it's directly related to official military business.\n\nAnd for outdoor exercise, troops were long required to wear reflective neon belts and vests when running, walking, and so on, even in broad daylight. The Marines ditched that rule in 2015. In 2019, it took the Army's service secretary weighing to change those rules so that soldiers only wear glow belts at night.",

It is hard to assess public sentiment about sensitive subjects like the war in Russia due to the country's tightly controlled public discourse.\n\nThe result came as Russia's economic boom, driven by wartime spending and subsidies, cooled.\n\nIn November, Russia's industrial output fell 0.7% from a year ago, following a 3.1% increase in October, Rosstat, Russia's official statistics agency, said Wednesday. Reuters reported that day that analysts expected a 1.2% increase in output.\n\nThe profits of Russian companies declined nearly 10% to 21.6 trillion rubles, or $273.4 billion, from January through October.\n\nHigh — but moderating — inflation, weaker energy revenues, a strong ruble, and tight credit have weighed on consumer demand and real incomes, squeezing private-sector activity.\n\nA separate, independent poll of 1,608 Russians aged 18 and above showed that the economy and the war with Ukraine were their top concerns. The survey conducted between November 18 and 27 by the Levada Center was published December 16.\n\nIn a tightly choreographed phone-in event Friday with ordinary Russian citizens and journalists, known as the \"Direct Line,\" Putin acknowledged a sharp slowdown in economic growth — to 1% this year from 4.3% in 2024. He attributed it to government measures aimed at improving inflation.\n\nWhile Ukraine dominated the discussion, the broadcast was punctuated by flashes of public frustration, as text messages from viewers were displayed on a large screen in the hall, Reuters reported.\n\nThere were complaints about internet outages, poor water quality, and the rising cost of living — a reminder of how economic pressures affect the lives of Russians.",

    "fullText": "An explosion in Moscow on Wednesday killed three people, including two police officers, Russian investigators said, days after a car bomb killed a high-ranking general not far away.\n\nAn official from Ukraine’s military intelligence, known as GUR, told The Associated Press that the attack had been carried out as part of an agency operation. Another official from the agency said the police officers had taken part in Russia’s war in Ukraine, without providing details. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\n\nRussian authorities did not comment on who may be behind the attack. Since Moscow invaded nearly four years ago, Russian authorities have blamed Kyiv for several assassinations of military officers and public figures in Russia. Ukraine has claimed responsibility for some of them.\n\nOn Wednesday, two traffic police officers were approaching a suspicious individual when a device detonated, Russia's Investigative Committee spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko said in a statement. The officers and another person standing nearby died from their injuries.\n\nThe Interior Ministry named the officers as Lt. Ilya Klimanov, 24, who joined the Moscow police in October 2023, and Lt. Maxim Gorbunov, 25. Gorbunov had a wife and a 9-month-old daughter, the statement said.\n\nThe blast took place in the same area of the Russian capital where Lt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov was killed by a car bomb on Monday. Sarvarov was the head of the Operational Training Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces’ General Staff.\n\nInvestigators have said they are looking into whether Ukraine was behind that attack, which was the third such killing of a senior military officer in just over a year. Ukraine has not commented on it.\n\nUkraine — which is outnumbered by Russia’s larger, better equipped military — has frequently tried to change the course of the war by attacking in unexpected ways.\n\nIn August last year, Ukrainian forces staged a surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region even as they struggled to stem Russian offensives elsewhere. Moscow’s troops eventually drove them out, but the incursion diverted Russian military resources and raised Ukrainian morale.\n\nIn June, swarms of drones launched from trucks targeted bomber bases across Russia.\n\nMoscow has also blamed assassinations on Ukraine. Just over a year ago, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the chief of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed by a bomb hidden on an electric scooter outside his apartment building. Kirillov’s assistant also died. Ukraine’s security service claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nDays after Moskalik’s killing, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he received a report from the head of Ukraine’s foreign intelligence agency on the “liquidation” of top Russian military figures, adding that “justice inevitably comes” although he didn’t mention Moskalik’s name.\n\nMeanwhile, Western officials have accused Russia of staging a campaign of disruption and sabotage across Europe as part of an effort to sap support for Ukraine. Moscow has denied the claims.",

    "description": "The USS Nautilus, the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, participated in scientific and military operations around the world.",
    "fullText": "On January 17, 1955, the USS Nautilus transmitted a historic message: \"Underway on nuclear power.\"\n\nAs the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, Nautilus could remain submerged for two weeks at a time and travel at speeds of over 20 knots, or about 23 miles per hour.\n\nPreviously, World War II submarines powered by diesel engines and electric batteries could stay underwater for just 12 to 48 hours at a time. Since their batteries only charged while surfaced, diesel-electric US Navy vessels like the USS Cobia had to move at around 2 or 3 miles per hour to conserve power and hit maximum speeds of 9 knots, or about 10 miles per hour.\n\nNautilus is now part of the Submarine Force Museum in Groton, Connecticut. Visitors can walk through the historic nuclear submarine and see how its crew members lived and worked while submerged up to 700 feet below the surface.\n\nI visited the museum in March to tour Nautilus. Take a look inside.\n\nNautilus, which was commissioned in 1954, hosted the first-ever underwater legislative meeting when 13 members of Congress rode Nautilus in 1955.\n\nIts nuclear power allowed Nautilus to sail under the polar ice cap and become the first ship to traverse the North Pole in 1958 in an expedition known as Operation Sunshine.\n\nNautilus also participated in the naval blockade of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.\n\nAfter 26 years of service, Nautilus was decommissioned in 1980 and recognized as a National Historic Landmark in 1982. It opened to the public as part of the Submarine Force Museum in Groton, Connecticut, in 1986.\n\nIn 2021, Nautilus underwent $36 million of preservation work and reopened in 2022.\n\nThe Submarine Force Museum is open Wednesday through Monday and is free to visit.\n\nI was amazed by the size of the submarine. As I climbed aboard, the deck provided gorgeous views of the Thames River.\n\nHere, crew members loaded torpedoes for firing.\n\nAfter the torpedoes were loaded, the tubes were flooded with water. When the command to fire was issued, high-pressure air from the submarine's ejection pump then forced the water and the torpedoes out of the tubes.\n\nSigns on the sink and mirror indicated that they were part of the submarine's original equipment.\n\nNautilus had a crew of 11 officers and 105 enlisted service members.\n\nA panel of instruments along the wardroom's wall indicated Nautilus' depth and speed.\n\nOfficers ate the same meals as the rest of the crew members, but their food was brought up to the officers' pantry via a dumbwaiter to be reheated and served on Navy china.\n\nThe walls of the narrow hallway were covered in wood paneling.\n\nThe book was gifted to Nautilus' commanding officer, Commander William R. Anderson, in 1957 by the French Navy's chief of staff, Adm. Henri Nomy. The fictional submarine in the book is also named Nautilus.\n\nFewer beds in a room indicated a higher rank.\n\nThe executive officer, also known as the \"XO,\" was the ship's second-in-command.\n\nThe commanding officer used the stateroom as a workspace and living quarters.\n\nThe yeoman managed the ship's correspondence and personnel records.\n\nThe attack center contained periscopes to spot enemy ships and the controls to aim and fire torpedoes.\n\nOn the diagram, Nautilus is represented by the bottom ship, and the top ship represents the target.\n\nThe torpedo firing key, which was used to deploy the torpedoes, was indicated with a blue sign on the firing panel.\n\nThe guns were used for security while the submarine was in port.\n\nSonar stands for \"sound navigation and ranging.\" Active sonar emitted sound pulses to locate targets, while passive sonar listened for underwater activity.\n\nBefore that, ladders were used to climb from one level to another.\n\nCommands were issued in the control room by a crew member known as the diving officer of the watch, who received orders from the attack center.\n\nWhen the main ballast tanks filled with water, the submarine would submerge. When filled with air, the submarine would surface.\n\nThe ESM bay's instruments could detect other ships' radars.\n\nThe radio room was located just off the control room on the right.\n\nHere, crew members ate meals, worked, and spent their recreational time.\n\nDamage control personnel used OBAs if fires broke out on board while submerged. The hoses on the masks could be attached to the submarine's reserve air supply.\n\nSince there was no Navy chaplain on board the submarine, crew member volunteers conducted services for various faiths with items from the lay services box.\n\nNautilus was mainly powered by its nuclear reactor, but the battery served as an auxiliary source of power in case of an emergency.\n\nA window connected the galley to the scullery, where crew members washed dishes.\n\nNautilus had two crew quarters, one at the front of the submarine and one at the back.\n\nI swiveled the periscope until I could see my car sitting in the museum's parking lot, which was pretty cool.\n\nJust over 70 years after Nautilus was commissioned as the first nuclear-powered submarine in the world, all of the US Navy's submarines are now nuclear-powered, according to the Department of Defense.",

    "title": "Ukrainian soldiers have incredible tactical patience and are far happier moving slowly than the British military",
    "description": "The Ukrainians are \"are very happy being slow\" as they know they need to secure everything, a British military officer told BI.",
    "fullText": "Some Western trainers working with Ukrainian soldiers first assumed their trainees were \"a bit lazy\" when they insisted on moving slowly, a former instructor told Business Insider.\n\nBut as the British military officer helping lead the training watched them meticulously secure everything and learned why the Ukrainians were doing what they were doing, he realized it all made tactical sense. Rushing can be fatal, as a soldier could miss a trip wire, bunker, or some other danger lurking on the battlefield.\n\nMaj. Maguire, who spoke to Business Insider about his Operation Interflex experience on the condition that just his rank and last name be used, said there was a \"mindset difference\" between the Ukrainians and the British. It is distinct because Ukraine is in an existential fight with practical combat experience.\n\nFrom their experiences battling Russia, the Ukrainians had discovered that speed isn't always best; sometimes, moving slowly with patience is key to surviving the fight. Clearing a trench is an activity that demands soldiers move quickly, but others demand a slower pace, a higher degree of caution.\n\nIn an urban environment, they were fine with moving at a crawl — seizing a building and sitting on it for hours until they'd coordinated everything and fully understood their next step.\n\n\"They are very happy being slow,\" Maguire said.\n\nHe said the Ukrainians would take a long time to go through a door, \"because they will stop. They will look for wires, they will check absolutely everything on it.\" Doing all of that in a tactically safe way \"takes a long time.\"\n\nFor six months, until July 2024, Maguire led leadership training for Ukrainian soldiers who already had combat experience. His experience was the Ukrainian troops would not move on to the next house \"until they had every single potential firing hole, point, position, mine suppressed and looked after. They won't move until they've aligned the drones or the artillery behind it to do it.\"\n\nMaguire said that the British trainers were a bit impatient, as the mindset is \"you get in there, let's do it,\" but attitudes shifted as they talked to and learned from the Ukrainians. He said they realized the \"take your time\" approach was actually \"pretty good.\"\n\nThe Ukrainians have been battling Russia's full-scale invasion for years now, but fighting in eastern Ukraine has been ongoing for over a decade. Maguire said that the Ukrainians have a \"greater understanding of what it takes to win\" and a \"sheer determination\" compared to the UK armed forces.\n\n\"That's not to say the British Army doesn't have it,\" he said. But the Ukrainians he trained had come straight from \"hardcore conventional fighting,\" bringing a level of instinctive aggression and combat readiness that he said exceeded what British troops typically display, having gone years without engaging in a high-intensity conventional fight.\n\nUkraine is fighting a very different kind of war compared to those its partners in the US and across Europe have in recent decades. It's confronting one of the world's largest militaries, with massed fires, armor, and significant airpower. This war is not the counterinsurgencies Western forces have spent years preparing for.\n\nThis large-scale war, with the return of old features like trench warfare and the introduction of new tech like drones, is a far cry from what Western militaries have been focusing on. This is a clash of old and new in a brutal, grinding attritional fight.\n\nThe UK and other allies are watching the war closely, warning that Russia may attack elsewhere in Europe and spark a wider conflict. They want to understand what a fight with Russia would require, and Maguire said Interflex is teaching Western forces while it is teaching Ukrainians.\n\nInterflex has become a two-way exchange. Many of the Ukrainians going through the program have front-line experience their instructors do not. Maguire said that Ukrainian insights — including what worked against Russia — were absorbed into Interflex's curriculum and even fed back into the UK's own training programs.\n\nHe said that training sergeants who already had \"wounds of war\" was intimidating for the Western trainers. \"There are things that they are much better than us at,\" he said.\n\nInterflex has trained more than 56,000 Ukrainians, both new recruits and experienced soldiers, with support from 13 partner nations, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Lithuania.\n\nMaguire said there were many differences between the British and Ukrainian approaches, and those differences have begun to influence British thinking.\n\nHe described the Ukrainians as being \"far more comfortable in taking tactical risks\" and said the most skilled among them are \"just able to show a bit more imagination.\" That willingness to innovate and experiment, he added, is a lesson Western forces are paying attention to as the war evolves.",

    "fullText": "Zampella created the template for multiplayer shooters that is still used today, and his cinematic and epic military, sci-fi and Star Wars games thrilled and moved millions\n\nVince Zampella dies aged 55 – news\n\nOn Sunday, Vince Zampella, the co-creator of the Call of Duty video game series, died in a car crash in Los Angeles at the age of 55. Though best known for that series of blockbuster military shooters, Zampella touched a huge number of lives – not only the hundreds of people who worked at the game development studios he led under Activision and EA, but the millions of people who played the games that bore his imprint.\n\nA lifelong gamer, Zampella had a Pong console as a child, then an Atari 2600 and a Commodore 64. He told IGN in 2016 that his favourite game from childhood was Donkey Kong: “I would spend hours at the arcade playing it.” Zampella’s first job in the industry was at GameTek in Miami, which specialised in video-game versions of popular US quizshows. He described his role on the small team as: “producer slash customer services slash tester – whatever needed to be done.”\n\nIt was at a developer called 2015, Inc in Tulsa that Zampella had his first smash hit as lead designer. Medal of Honor: Allied Assault was the third title in the acclaimed series of second world war shooters, which had been inspired by Saving Private Ryan and written in conjunction with Steven Spielberg. Zampella had envisioned a new type of shooter with an epic, cinematic sense of immersion. The game was a bestseller, acclaimed for its globetrotting narrative and taut, tense action – especially during its thrilling depiction of the Omaha beach landing.\n\nWhen publisher Electronic Arts made the decision to take the development of Medal of Honour in-house, Zampella and his colleague Jason West left, together with Grant Collier, and set up Infinity Ward in Los Angeles. There they created Call of Duty, a second world war shooter designed to exceed Medal of Honor’s sense of epic drama – indeed, its original development title had been Medal of Honor Killer. Critically, the game featured a range of lead characters including US, British and Russian fighters rather than giving players control of a single “super soldier”. “It’s meant to show you that no one side won the war – it was an allied effort,” Zampella said at the time.\n\nOnce again, the emphasis was on dramatic set-piece battles on a vast scale, with the player surrounded by computer-controlled allies giving the impression of being a small part of a wider campaign. “We’re all about authenticity and intensity,” Zampella said. “We’ve strived to put as many guys on screen as possible. It’s about your squad, not you as a lone gunman.”\n\nThis emphasis on teamwork and cinematic intensity would become emblematic of Call of Duty. While two sequels remained in the theatre of the second world war, for the fourth title, released in 2007, Zampella and West decided to move into the modern era. The result, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, is one of the most important and influential first-person shooters ever made.\n\nIts campaign features a group of special forces operatives, including newcomer John “Soap” MacTavish and grizzled SAS captain John Price, taking on Russian ultra-nationalists and a Middle Eastern warlord. It had imaginative and exciting missions, including All Ghillied Up, a sniper mission in the wake of the Chornobyl disaster, and the eerie Death From Above, in which players control the various weapons of a C-130 aircraft, taking out enemies on the ground who appear merely as dots on an infrared screen. Meanwhile, the game’s online multiplayer mode brought new innovations including kill-streaks, which allowed players on a winning run to call in special attacks such as airstrikes. Infinity Ward created the template for multiplayer shooters that is still used today. Call of Duty’s DNA is present in every modern hit of the genre.\n\nIn 2010, Zampella and West were fired from Infinity Ward by publisher Activision, and went on to form Respawn Entertainment, taking more than 30 Call of Duty staff with them. Under new publisher Electronic Arts, the company released Titanfall in 2014, a multiplayer-focused sci-fi shooter intended to innovate within the genre. The game emphasised the player’s freedom of movement, allowing for smooth, parkour-style navigation of obstacles and structures. Players were also able to call in and pilot giant, heavily armed mechs. As Zampella explained at the time: “It’s taking the old paradigm of these shooter games being very grounded and two-dimensional and now adding this verticality to it and making it something that’s a new experience; something that people haven’t seen before.”\n\nAfter splitting with Activision, Zampella advised several other game creatives who found themselves at odds with their publishers and were considering striking out on their own. One of them was Hideo Kojima, creator of Metal Gear Solid and, at his own studio Kojima Productions, the Death Stranding series. “When I was preparing to go independent myself, and maybe because he felt we were in similar situations, he took the time to listen to me, offered advice, and supported me in many ways,” wrote a “heartbroken” Kojima on X after Zampella’s death. “He even showed me around the studio. Even after he moved to DICE, whenever I went to Los Angeles, we would have meals together and talk about our respective futures”\n\nTitanfall’s sequel added an extraordinary single-player story to the original’s fluid online play – it is still one of the best shooter campaigns around. That series’ emphasis on smooth, seamless movement would also characterise Respawn’s entry into the battle royale genre: Apex Legends. Released with almost no pre-publicity in 2019, it would attract 10m players in its opening 72 hours and still maintains a place in the pantheon alongside Fortnite and Call of Duty: Warzone.\n\nRespawn next made two excellent single-player Star Wars games, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Survivor. Zampella’s peers have noted that working on the Star Wars franchise brought him and his colleagues at Respawn great joy.\n\nIn 2020, Electronic Arts put Zampella in charge of the Battlefield franchise, with a remit to recharge the series after the disappointing performance of Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042. Released in October, Battlefield 6 was widely praised as a return to form, especially the online multiplayer modes. It sold 7m copies in three days, the best ever opening for the series.\n\nZampella will be remembered as one of the most influential game designers of his era and a ceaseless innovator in the first-person shooter genre – and with the Star Wars Jedi series, outside it. He was someone whom you always looked forward to encountering or interviewing at games industry events, an outspoken creative who cared deeply about video games and the player’s experience.\n\n“Vince was an extraordinary person – a gamer at heart, but also a visionary executive with a rare ability to recognise talent and give people the freedom and confidence to create something truly great,” wrote Geoff Keighley on X, who runs the Game Awards and, as a former games journalist, worked on a documentary about Titanfall with Zampella. “Even when it was difficult or uncomfortable, Vince never wavered in his commitment to honesty and transparency. He believed that the truth mattered, and he was willing to share it with the world. Vince cared deeply about doing the right thing. And even while working inside large organisations, he consistently pushed to put players first – to prioritise the experience, the craft and the people who played the games. He leaves behind an incredible legacy of work … I always felt he still had his greatest one ahead of him. It’s heartbreaking that we’ll never get to play it.”",

    "title": "Taiwan needs to flood the battlefield with cheap, mobile, and survivable weapons to counter China, former senior military officer says",
    "description": "In a war with China, Taiwan could have an asymmetric advantage with a high volume of cheap and survivable weapons, a retired admiral said.",
    "fullText": "To prepare for a possible all-out war with China, Taiwan should focus on fielding substantial numbers of cheap, mobile, and survivable weapons, a former top Taiwanese defense official said.\n\nTaiwan currently faces two types of conflict — what experts and officials have referred to as China's gray-zone activities that are just below the threshold of war and the potential for a full-scale Chinese invasion. Countering both requires an array of weaponry.\n\nAt a Hudson Institute think tank event earlier this month, retired admiral and former chief of the general staff for Taiwan's defense ministry Lee Hsi-Min said Taiwan needed to prioritize the existential threat of a Chinese invasion. Gray-zone actions, such as frequent aircraft incursions, strain resources and stress assets and troops. The other could be catastrophic, as war games have shown.\n\n\"We need a large number of the distributed, mobile, survivable, lethal\" weapons, Lee argued, and those systems need to be low-cost, high-volume, and highly survivable in a fight, he added.\n\nAsymmetric warfare is a strategy that uses large numbers of inexpensive, mobile, hard-to-target systems — like drones, missiles, and dispersed units — to blunt a larger military's advantages by denying it easy targets and inflicting outsized damage. Think drones blowing up tanks in Ukraine or sinking Russian warships.\n\nLee argues that Taiwan's survival in a war against China depends on exactly this kind of strategy.\n\nTaiwan has aggressively pursued a strategy focused on weapons that fit these bills, including various types of drones, sensors, jamming, and anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles. Broader elements of increased investments in asymmetric warfare plans include how the civilian population of Taiwan is trained for a potential Chinese invasion and how the Taiwanese military would use urban warfare to hold off Chinese forces.\n\nThis doesn't mean conventional platforms and high-end weapons aren't valuable, Lee said, especially for helping Taiwan deter the everyday activities the Chinese military engages in, such as aggressive actions in the air and sea and massive exercises regularly held nearby. However, \"we need scalable\" and \"smart enough\" weapons, he said.\n\n\"If we are conducting the protracted war, sometimes the quantity means quality,\" Lee said. \"If we only have a kind of a small number of the advanced, sophisticated platform, I think we will have a big problem if China decided to attack Taiwan.\"\n\nSimilar lessons are being learned from the war in Ukraine. Soldiers, veterans, and drone makers have all said that a limited arsenal of exquisite systems isn't the right fit for a long war. The need is large volumes of cheap weapons. In warfare, sustainability is key. Overengineering and overspending simply aren't sustainable in a high-end fight.\n\nLee previously argued for asymmetric warfare and more mobile, uncrewed weapons and systems rather than buying more conventional weaponry like fighter jets and tanks in his \"Overall Defense Concept.\"\n\nIn 2020, he wrote in an article for The Diplomat that the idea is based on the premise that China will continue to see claiming Taiwan as a national and existential priority and Beijing will keep pouring money and resources into its military, which is vastly out-scaling Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan's government budgets for defense have increased substantially in recent years, and it continues to buy missiles, air defense systems, and drones from the US and other allies and partners.\n\nBut given the significant disparity between China and Taiwan's militaries and capabilities, \"Taiwan must abandon notions of a traditional war of attrition with the PLA [People’s Liberation Army],\" Lee and co-author Eric Lee, then a researcher at the Project 2049 Institute, wrote.\n\nTaiwan faces a substantially stronger adversary, and thus \"embracing an effective asymmetric defense posture and incorporating tactical asymmetric capabilities could compensate for Taiwan's disadvantage on paper and prevent the PLA from getting boots on the ground,\" they argued.\n\nAt the moment, Taiwan is leaning on a mix of capabilities. This month, the US announced its largest-ever weapons sale to Taiwan, at $11 billion. It includes High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, Army Tactical Missile Systems, Javelin missiles, howitzers, and drones.\n\nTaiwan's defense ministry said the weapons help bolster its self-defense and deterrence capabilities. China's foreign ministry said the sale violated agreements between Beijing and Washington and risked military confrontation with Taiwan.\n\nAn important piece of Taiwan's asymmetric strategy is rapid investment in domestic drone production, informed by lessons from Ukraine and collaborations with US and European firms. Taipei aims to produce 200,000 drones annually by 2030 and is investing billions into other defense systems, including a new air-defense network known as T-Dome.",

Fanil Sarvarov, head of the Operational Training Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces' General Staff, died from his injuries, said Svetlana Petrenko, the spokesperson for Russia’s Investigative Committee, the nation's top criminal investigation agency.\n\n“Investigators are pursuing numerous lines of inquiry regarding the murder. One of these is that the crime was orchestrated by Ukrainian intelligence services,” Petrenko said.\n\nSince Moscow sent troops into Ukraine nearly four years ago, Russian authorities have blamed Ukraine for several assassinations of military officers and public figures in Russia. Ukraine has claimed responsibility for some of them. It has not yet commented on Monday's death.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that President Vladimir Putin had been immediately informed about Sarvarov's killing.\n\nThe Defense Ministry said that Sarvarov had previously fought in Chechnya and taken part in Moscow's military campaign in Syria.\n\nJust over a year ago, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the chief of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed by a bomb hidden on an electric scooter outside his apartment building. Kirillov's assistant also died. Ukraine’s security service claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nAn Uzbek man was quickly arrested and charged with killing Kirillov on behalf of the Ukrainian security service.\n\nPutin described Kirillov’s killing as a “major blunder” by Russia’s security agencies, noting they should learn from it and improve their efficiency.\n\nIn April, another senior Russian military officer, Lt. Gen. Yaroslav Moskalik, a deputy head of the main operational department in the General Staff, was killed by an explosive device placed in his car parked near his apartment building just outside Moscow. A suspected perpetrator was quickly arrested.\n\nDays after Moskalik's killing, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he received a report from the head of Ukraine’s foreign intelligence agency on the “liquidation” of top Russian military figures, adding that “justice inevitably comes\" although he didn't mention Moskalik's name.",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW (AP) — President Vladimir Putin emphasized Friday that Moscow’s troops were advancing across the battlefield in Ukraine and voiced confidence the Kremlin would achieve its goals militarily if Kyiv doesn't agree to Russia's conditions in peace talks.\n\nSpeaking at his tightly orchestrated annual news conference that lasted about 4 1/2 hours, Putin declared that Russian forces have “fully seized strategic initiative” and would make more gains by year's end.\n\nIn the early days of the conflict in 2022, Ukraine's forces thwarted an attempt by Russia’s larger, better-equipped army, to capture the capital of Kyiv. But the fighting soon settled into grinding battles, and Moscow's troops have made slow and steady progress over the years. Putin frequently touts this progress — even though it's not the lightning advance many expected.\n\n“Our troops are advancing all across the line of contact, faster in some areas or slower in some others, but the enemy is retreating in all sectors,” Putin said at the live news conference, which is combined with a nationwide call-in show that offers Russians across the country the opportunity to ask questions of their leader.\n\nPutin, 73, has ruled the country for 25 years and uses the event to cement his power and air his views on domestic and global affairs during a broadcast that mixes criticism of the West with promises of more social payments. Although he is sometimes asked about his personal life, he gives scant details.\n\nThis year, the news conference took place against the backdrop of a peace plan in Ukraine put forward by U.S. President Donald Trump. Despite the extensive diplomatic push, Washington’s efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nWhile the event has previously focused heavily on domestic questions — and has offered Putin a chance to expound on topics from the price of eggs to water cuts — Ukraine dominated it this year. Since it is highly choreographed, that could reflect the Kremlin’s desire to assuage the public after nearly four years of fighting.\n\nRussian demands remain unchanged\n\nPutin praised Trump's peace efforts and reaffirmed that Moscow was ready for a peaceful settlement that would address the “root causes” of the conflict, a reference to the Kremlin’s tough conditions for a deal. He said he has agreed to make “certain compromises” and “uneasy decisions” at the Alaska summit with Trump in August but didn't elaborate.\n\nHe wants all the areas in four key regions captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory. He has also insisted that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow’s forces haven’t captured yet. Kyiv has publicly rejected all these demands.\n\nThe Kremlin has also insisted that Ukraine abandon its bid to join NATO and warned that it wouldn't accept the deployment of any troops from members of the military alliance members and would view them as “legitimate target.”\n\nPutin also has repeatedly said Ukraine must limit the size of its army and give official status to the Russian language — demands he has made from the outset of the conflict.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine’s bid to join NATO if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to alliance members. But at the same time, he has emphasized that Ukraine believes NATO membership remains the best security guarantee.\n\n″The United States don’t see us in NATO, for now,\" Zelenskyy said this week. “Politicians change.”\n\nCommenting on Zelenskyy's statement that he was ready to call a presidential election if a ceasefire is established, Putin responded that Russia has held elections without demanding a truce. He said that Moscow was ready to consider the issue and could agree to halt attacks deep inside Ukraine on the election day, but noted that millions of Ukrainians living in Russia must have the right to vote. Ukraine introduced martial law banning elections, but Russia hasn't made such a move.\n\nPutin rebuffed Western claims about purported Russian plans to attack European nations as “sheer nonsense” aimed at deflecting public attention from domestic problems.\n\nHe particularly singled out NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte for his statements about the Kremlin's aggressive intentions, pointing out Trump's recently published national security strategy that doesn’t name Russia as a direct adversary. “How can you prepare NATO for a war with Russia if the main member of NATO doesn't consider us as an enemy?” Putin said.\n\nHe alleged that European elites “impudently” backed Trump's Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election and now hope the U.S. political landscape will change after the midterm elections to Congress, helping raise pressure on the White House.\n\nPutin says seizing Russian assets will backfire\n\nAs it faces grinding Russian advances across the front line and relentless attacks on its energy facilities, Ukraine desperately cash infusions from its Western allies.\n\nOn Friday, European Union leaders agreed to provide a massive interest-free loan, but they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds.\n\nThe leaders tried to reassure Belgium, where most of the frozen assets are held, that they would protect it from any retaliation from Moscow if it backed the plan, but the leaders eventually opted to borrow the money on capital markets.\n\nUsing Russian assets to help Kyiv would have amounted to “robbery,” Putin said, adding that the move would have spooked investors, “dealing not only an image blow but undermining confidence in the eurozone.”\n\nPutin says troop numbers are strong\n\nPutin said the flow of volunteer soldiers has remained strong, topping 400,000 this year. It was not possible to independently verify that claim since little is known about the recruitment effort.\n\nBut the government offers relatively high pay and extensive benefits that have helped swell troop ranks. The Kremlin says it exclusively relies on volunteers to fight in Ukraine, but some media reports and rights groups have said that military officers often coerce conscripts into signing military contracts.\n\nAsked by a soldier’s widow about slow pension payments, Putin apologized and vowed the issue would be quickly resolved — a typical exchange at the annual event, which he often uses to show his command of a wide array of subjects and his ability to solve problems.\n\nThe news conference featured questions from journalists in the Gostinny Dvor amphitheater as well as via video links from across Russia. A young man in a red bow tie who held a placard saying he wanted to get married used his question to Putin to propose to his girlfriend. Later, one of the anchors hosting the event reported that she had answered “yes,” and Putin joked about collecting money for the wedding.",

    "description": "How should a military commander respond if they determine they have received an unlawful order?",
    "fullText": "How should a military commander respond if they determine they have received an unlawful order?\n\nRequest to retire — and refrain from resigning in protest, which could be seen as a political act, or picking a fight to get fired.\n\nThat was the previously unreported guidance that Brig. Gen. Eric Widmar, the top lawyer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, gave to the country’s top general, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, in November, according to sources familiar with the discussion.\n\nCaine had just seen a video that included six Democratic lawmakers publicly urging US troops to disobey illegal orders. He asked Widmar, according to the sources, what the latest guidance was on how to determine whether an order was lawful and how a commander should reply if it is not.\n\nWidmar responded that they should consult with their legal adviser if they’re unsure, the sources said. But ultimately, if they determine that an order is illegal, they should consider requesting retirement.\n\nThe guidance sheds new light on how top military officials are thinking about an issue that has reached a fever pitch in recent weeks, as lawmakers and legal experts have repeatedly questioned the legality of the US military’s counternarcotics operations in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean including intense scrutiny of a “double-tap” strike that deliberately killed survivors on September 2.\n\nCaine is not in the chain of command. But he is closely involved in operations, including those in SOUTHCOM, and is often tasked with presenting military options to the president—more so than Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, CNN has reported.\n\nThe Joint Staff declined to comment for this story.\n\nSeveral senior officers who reportedly expressed concerns about the boat strikes, including former US Southern Command commander Adm. Alvin Holsey and Lt. Gen. Joe McGee, the former director for Strategy, Plans, and Policy on the Joint Staff, have retired early in recent months.\n\nWidmar’s advice to Caine was meant to help inform the chairman’s discussions with senior military officials should the issue come up, the sources said. The Democrats’ video had become headline news, enraging Hegseth and sparking debates across the country.\n\nA separate official familiar with military legal advice said that it is not uncommon for lawyers to urge servicemembers to consider leaving the force if they believe they’re being asked to do something they are personally uncomfortable with, but it’s typically handled on a case-by-case basis and tailored to the facts of the situation.\n\nOther current and former US officials, however, including those who have served as miliary lawyers in the Judge Advocate General corps, stressed that broadly encouraging servicemembers to quietly retire — if they’re eligible — rather than voice dissent in the face of a potentially illegal order risks perpetuating a culture of silence and lack of accountability.\n\n“A commissioned officer has every right to say, ‘this is wrong,’ and shouldn’t be expected to quietly and silently walk away just because they’re given a free pass to do so,” said a former senior defense official who left the Pentagon earlier this year.\n\nMore than a dozen senior officers have either been fired or retired early since Trump took office in January, an unusually high rate of turnover. In a speech before hundreds of general and flag officers in September, Hegseth directed officers to “do the honorable thing and resign” if they didn’t agree with his vision for the department.\n\nBut disagreeing with the direction of the military is different than viewing an order as illegal, legal experts said.\n\nDan Maurer, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and former JAG lawyer, said that the guidance, as described by CNN, appears to “misunderstand what a servicemember is supposed to do in the face of an unlawful order: disobey it if confident that the order is unlawful and attempt to persuade the order-giver to stop or modify it have failed, and report it through the chain of command.”\n\nMaurer added that “if the guidance does not explicitly advise servicemembers that they have a duty to disobey unlawful orders, the guidance is not a legitimate statement of professional military ethics and the law.”\n\nWidmar advised that an order may be unlawful if it is “patently illegal,” or something an ordinary person would recognize instinctively as a violation of domestic or international law, the sources said — the My Lai massacre in Vietnam is an oft-used example. But the guidance he provided was that an unlawful order should be met with retirement, if possible, and did not note that servicemembers have a duty to disobey unlawful orders, the sources said.\n\n“It’s a very safe recommendation in this current political environment,” said the former senior defense official. “But that doesn’t make it the right or ethical one.”\n\nExperts on civil military relations have previously pointed to retirement as a reasonable option for officers who object to a particular policy, while noting that it comes with its own costs.\n\nIn a September article that has been discussed amongst the Joint Staff and other senior military officials, Peter Feaver, a political science professor at Duke University, and Heidi Urben, a former Army intelligence officer and current associate director of Georgetown University’s security studies program, wrote that “quiet quitting”, or opting for retirement “allows officers with professionally grounded objections to leave without posing a direct challenge to civilian control.”\n\nAnd while officers shouldn’t resign in protest or pick fights, they argued, they should “speak up” and “show moral courage” when the military’s professional values and ideals are at risk.\n\nAnd they should be willing to be fired for it. “Complete silence can be corrosive to good order and discipline and signal to the force that the military’s professional values and norms are expendable,” they wrote.\n\nMaurer, the former Army officer, said the advice to retire in the face of an unlawful order also functions to “keep that person silent in perpetuity, because as a retiree he or she remains subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which criminalizes a broad range of conduct and speech that would be constitutionally protected for regular civilians.”\n\nThose constraints have been apparent as the Pentagon has launched an investigation into Sen. Mark Kelly, a retired Navy captain and one of the Democratic lawmakers seen in the video encouraging troops to disobey unlawful orders, which prompted Caine to seek the legal advice.\n\nAs questions continue to swirl around the legality of the boat strike campaign, Widmar also advised Caine that Article II of the Constitution gives the president the authority to authorize lethal force to protect the nation, unless hostilities rise to the level of a full-blown war — in which case Congressional approval is required, the sources said.\n\nWhether the president’s orders are legal to begin with, Widmar advised according to the sources, is a question only the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel can answer, due to the executive order Trump issued in February that says the president and the attorney general’s “opinions on questions of law are controlling” on all executive branch employees — to include US troops.\n\nThe Office of Legal Counsel determined in September that it is legal for Trump to order strikes on suspected drug boats because they pose an imminent threat to the United States, CNN has reported.\n\nSince September 2, the US military has killed at least 99 people across dozens of strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, arguing that those targeted were “narcoterrorists” that pose a direct threat to the United States. The Trump administration has also not provided public evidence of the presence of narcotics on the boats struck, nor their affiliation with drug cartels.\n\nLawmakers have said that Pentagon officials have acknowledged in private briefings not knowing the identities of everyone on board a vessel before striking it; instead, military officials only need to confirm that the individuals are affiliated with a cartel or criminal organization to target them.\n\nSome members of Congress, legal experts and human rights groups have argued that potential drug traffickers are civilians who should not be summarily killed but arrested—something the Coast Guard did routinely, and continues to do in the eastern Pacific, when encountering a suspected drug trafficking vessel.\n\nCNN’s Haley Britzky contributed to this report",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is promising more checks.\n\nIn an economic address to the nation that aired during prime time on Wednesday, Trump said $1,776 in bonus checks would be sent to military members for Christmas — and that tariffs are funding the payments.\n\nIt is unclear if the checks are legal and can be made without the approval of Congress, which has the constitutional power to enact a budget and appropriate funds.\n\nThe speech comes as Trump works to sell the nation on his economic plans.\n\nAccording to a NPR/PBS News Marist Poll earlier in December, Trump's economic rating hit a low this term, with only 36% saying they approve of how the president is handling the economy.\n\nIn a recent interview with Politico, Trump said he would give his economy a grade of \"A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.\"\n\nTrump is embarking on an economic tour across swing states to campaign for Republican candidates in the midterms. In his first stop in Philadelphia, he defended his tariffs and called the Democrats' criticism that his policies are driving up prices a \"hoax.\"\n\nTrump had also promised other checks in the past. He's floated such a $2,000 tariff dividend for every American below a certain income level, though congressional Republicans have balked at the idea. And he announced a $10,000 bonuse to select Transportation Security Administration employees for remaining at their posts during the 43-day federal government shutdown.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comments.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE Dec 17 - In a high-security Shenzhen laboratory, Chinese scientists have built what Washington has spent years trying to prevent: a prototype of a machine capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence, smartphones and weapons central to Western military dominance, Reuters has learned.\n\nCompleted in early 2025 and now undergoing testing, the prototype fills nearly an entire factory floor. It was built by a team of former engineers from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML who reverse-engineered the company's extreme ultraviolet lithography machines or EUVs, according to two people with knowledge of the project.\n\nEUV machines sit at the heart of a technological Cold War. They use beams of extreme ultraviolet light to etch circuits thousands of times thinner than a human hair onto silicon wafers, currently a capability monopolized by the West. The ​smaller the circuits, the more powerful the chips.\n\nChina's machine is operational and successfully generating extreme ultraviolet light, but has not yet produced working chips, the people said.\n\nIn April, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet said that China would need \"many, many years\" to develop such technology. But the existence of this prototype, reported by Reuters for the first time, suggests China may be years closer to achieving semiconductor independence than analysts anticipated.\n\nNevertheless, China still faces major ‌technical challenges, particularly in replicating the precision optical systems that Western suppliers produce.\n\nThe availability of parts from older ASML machines on secondary markets has allowed China to build a domestic prototype, with the government setting a goal of producing working chips on the prototype by 2028, according to the two people.\n\nBut those close to the project say a more realistic target is 2030, which is still years earlier than the decade that analysts believed it would take China to match the West on chips.\n\nChinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a six-year government initiative to achieve ‌semiconductor self-sufficiency, one of President Xi Jinping's highest priorities. While China's semiconductor goals have been public, the Shenzhen EUV project has been conducted in secret, according to the people.\n\nThe project falls under the country's semiconductor strategy, which state media has identified as being run by Xi Jinping confidant Ding Xuexiang, who heads the Communist Party's Central Science and Technology Commission.",

    "fullText": "BEIRUT (AP) — Qassim Hamadeh woke to the sounds of gunfire and explosions in his village of Beit Jin in southwestern Syria last month. Within hours, he had lost two sons, a daughter-in-law and his 4-year-old and 10-year-old grandsons. The five were among 13 villagers killed that day by Israeli forces.\n\nIsraeli troops had raided the village — not for the first time — seeking to capture, as they said, members of a militant group planning attacks into Israel. Israel said militants opened fire at the troops, wounding six, and that troops returned fire and brought in air support.\n\nHamadeh, like others in Beit Jin, dismissed Israel’s claims of militants operating in the village. The residents said armed villagers confronted Israeli soldiers they saw as invaders, only to be met with Israeli tank and artillery fire, followed by a drone strike. The government in Damascus called it a “massacre.”\n\nThe raid and similar recent Israeli actions inside Syria have increased tensions, frustrated locals and also scuttled chances — despite U.S. pressure — of any imminent thaw in relations between the two neighbors.\n\nAn Israeli-Syrian rapprochement seemed possible last December, after Sunni Islamist-led rebels overthrew autocratic Syrian President Bashar Assad, a close ally of Iran, Israel’s archenemy.\n\nSyria’s interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, who led the rebels who took over the country, said he has no desire for a conflict with Israel. But Israel was suspicious, mistrusting al-Sharaa because of his militant past and his group’s history of aligning with al-Qaida.\n\nIsraeli forces quickly moved to impose a new reality on the ground. They mobilized into the U.N.-mandated buffer zone in southern Syria next to the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria during the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed — a move not recognized by most of the international community.\n\nIsraeli forces erected checkpoints and military installations, including on a hilltop that overlooks wide swaths of Syria. They set up landing pads on strategic Mt. Hermon nearby. Israeli reconnaissance drones frequently fly over surrounding Syrian towns, with residents often sighting Israeli tanks and Humvee vehicles patrolling those areas.\n\nIsrael has said its presence is temporary to clear out pro-Assad remnants and militants — to protect Israel from attacks. But it has given no indication its forces would leave anytime soon. Talks between the two countries to reach a security agreement have so far yielded no result.\n\nThe events in neighboring Lebanon, which shares a border with both Israel and Syria, and the two-year war in Gaza between Israel and the militant Palestinian group Hamas have also raised concerns among Syrians that Israel plans a permanent land grab in southern Syria.\n\nIsraeli forces still have a presence in southern Lebanon, over a year since a U.S.-brokered ceasefire halted the latest Israel-Hezbollah war. That war began a day after Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, with Hezbollah firing rockets into Israel in solidarity with its ally Hamas.\n\nIsrael’s operations in Lebanon, which included bombardment across the tiny country and a ground incursion last year, have severely weakened Hezbollah.\n\nToday, Israel still controls five hilltop points in southern Lebanon, launches near-daily airstrikes against alleged Hezbollah targets and flies reconnaissance drones over the country, sometimes also carrying out overnight ground incursions.\n\nIn Gaza, where U.S. President Donald Trump’s 20-point ceasefire deal has brought about a truce between Israel and Hamas, similar buffer zones under Israeli control are planned even after Israel eventually withdraws from the more than half of the territory it still controls.\n\nAt a meeting of regional leaders and international figures earlier this month in Doha, Qatar, al-Sharaa accused Israel of using imagined threats to justify aggressive actions.\n\n“All countries support an Israeli withdrawal\" from Syria to the lines prior to Assad's ouster, he said, adding that it was the only way for both Syria and Israel to \"emerge in a state of safety.”\n\nThe new leadership in Damascus has had a multitude of challenges since ousting Assad.\n\nAl-Sharaa's government has been unable to implement a deal with local Kurdish-led authorities in northeast Syria, and large areas of southern Sweida province are now under a de facto administration led by the Druze religious minority, following sectarian clashes there in mid-July with local Bedouin clans.\n\nSyrian government forces intervened, effectively siding with the Bedouins. Hundreds of civilians, mostly Druze, were killed, many by government fighters. Over half of the roughly 1 million Druze worldwide live in Syria. Most other Druze live in Lebanon and Israel, including in the Golan Heights.\n\nIsrael, which has cast itself as a defender of the Druze, though many of them in Syria are critical of its intentions, has also made overtures to Kurds in Syria.\n\n“The Israelis here are pursuing a very dangerous strategy,” said Michael Young, Senior Editor at the Beirut-based Malcolm H. Kerr Carnegie Middle East Center.\n\nIt contradicts, he added, the positions of Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt — and even the United States — which are \"all in agreement that what has to come out of this today is a Syrian state that is unified and fairly strong,” he added.\n\nIsrael and the US at odds over Syria\n\nIn a video released from his office after visiting Israeli troops wounded in Beit Jin, barely 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the edge of the U.N. buffer zone, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel seeks a “demilitarized buffer zone from Damascus to the (U.N.) buffer zone,” including Mt. Hermon.\n\n“It is also possible to reach an agreement with the Syrians, but we will stand by our principles in any case,” Netanyahu said.\n\nHis strategy has proven to be largely unpopular with the international community, including with Washington, which has backed al-Sharaa’s efforts to consolidate his control across Syria.\n\nIsrael’s operations in southern Syria have drawn rare public criticism from Trump, who has taken al-Sharaa, once on Washington's terror list, under his wing.\n\n“It is very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria’s evolution into a prosperous State,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social after the Beit Jin clashes.\n\nSyria is also expected to be on the agenda when Netanyahu visits the U.S. and meets with Trump later this month.\n\nExperts doubt Israel will withdraw from Syria anytime soon — and the new government in Damascus has little leverage or power against Israel's much stronger military.\n\n“If you set up landing pads, then you are not here for short-term,” Issam al-Reiss, a military adviser with the Syrian research group ETANA, said of Israeli actions.\n\nHamadeh, the laborer from Beit Jin, said he can “no longer bear the situation” after losing five of his family.\n\nIsrael, he said, “strikes wherever it wants, it destroys whatever it wants, and kills whoever it wants, and no one holds it accountable.”",
