    "fullText": "World War II wasn’t just fought by men and women on the front lines, it was also defined by the machines they rode, drove, and sailed into history. From towering cannons that shook the earth to massive battleships that seemed unsinkable, these vehicles weren’t just tools of war, they were icons of an era.\n\nThey carried with them the hopes of nations, the fears of enemies, and the awe of anyone who ever laid eyes on them. Today, long after their thunder has faded, these machines remain unforgettable, living on in movies, documentaries, and the collective memory of a world that witnessed the most intense conflict in history.\n\nWe’ve gathered a dozen of the most iconic, the ones that left the biggest dents not just in the battlefield, but in the imagination of generations.\n\nDuring World War II, the Germans unveiled one of the most jaw-dropping superweapons ever constructed: the Schwerer Gustav. This massive railway gun wasn’t just a piece of artillery; it was a rolling symbol of intimidation and ambition. Imagine a weapon so large it had to be transported in pieces, assembled on specially laid tracks, and required a small army of men just to operate.\n\nIts sheer presence turned heads wherever it was moved, a physical reminder of how far nations were willing to push the limits of engineering in the pursuit of victory. The Gustav wasn’t practical in the traditional sense; it was slow to move, exposed to air attack, and required enormous logistical support, but it did manage to fire upon fortified positions with shells the size of small cars. When it thundered, the earth shook, and even those far from the battlefield could feel its echo.\n\nAccording to History.com, the Japanese battleship Yamato has become a near-legend of World War II, a floating fortress that seemed almost too big to be real. Launched as the pride of the Imperial Japanese Navy, Yamato was designed to outgun anything that floated, carrying massive guns that could rain destruction over distances unimaginable for most ships of the time.\n\nBut its story is just as much about symbolism as it is about firepower. Japan built Yamato as a statement, a declaration that it would never be overshadowed on the high seas. When it sailed, it carried the weight of a nation’s pride, and its silhouette on the horizon inspired awe and dread in equal measure. Life aboard the ship was like living inside a steel city, and sailors felt both honored and burdened to serve on what was considered the ultimate warship. Yet Yamato’s greatness was undercut by the changing tides of war, where air power proved deadlier than naval guns.\n\nThe German battleship Bismarck was the terror of the Atlantic, a warship that embodied Germany’s determination to dominate the seas. When it set out, Allied sailors whispered its name with dread, knowing its guns could sink even the strongest battleships.\n\nIts most infamous moment came when it destroyed HMS Hood, Britain’s pride, in a clash that shocked the world. But this triumph only fueled the Allies’ obsession with bringing Bismarck down, sparking one of the most relentless hunts in naval history. The chase ended with the Bismarck crippled and sunk, a dramatic downfall that proved even legends could be cornered.\n\nThe Tiger I was more than just a tank; it was a monster of steel that rolled into battle like something out of a nightmare. German crews felt nearly unstoppable inside their armor, and Allied soldiers often spoke of Tigers with a mix of fear and respect.\n\nAlthough not the most numerous tank of the war, it became a symbol of German engineering and battlefield dominance. Its reputation was so fearsome that sometimes troops believed Tigers were present even when they weren’t. Stories of its invincibility spread faster than the tanks themselves, creating an aura that magnified its true impact.\n\nThe American Sherman tank wasn’t the most powerful or flashy, but it became the backbone of Allied ground forces. What made the Sherman iconic wasn’t unmatched strength, but its reliability and sheer numbers.\n\nThese tanks rolled across Europe in endless waves, a constant presence that wore down German defenses. Soldiers trusted the Sherman to get them where they needed to go, even if it wasn’t invincible against heavier armor. Its role in supporting infantry and keeping pressure on enemy positions was vital. The Sherman also carried symbolic weight as a machine that embodied America’s industrial might, producing vehicles faster than the enemy could destroy them.\n\nThe Soviet T-34 is often hailed as the tank that saved Russia, a machine built for resilience above all else. It was designed to fight in mud, snow, and harsh conditions that would have crippled more delicate machines.\n\nSoviet crews praised its toughness and mobility, and German soldiers learned to fear its sudden appearances. Unlike the Tigers, the T-34 wasn’t about prestige, it was about practicality and overwhelming numbers. It became the spearhead of massive offensives, pushing the Red Army deeper into enemy lines. Its silhouette is instantly recognizable, embodying the Soviet determination to endure and strike back.\n\nNicknamed “The Big E,” the USS Enterprise was the heart of the U.S. Navy’s carrier force during World War II. It fought in nearly every major battle in the Pacific, becoming a constant thorn in Japan’s side.\n\nSailors considered it a lucky ship, as it survived countless close calls and kept coming back stronger. Its aircraft struck decisive blows at battles like Midway, proving the aircraft carrier had replaced the battleship as the true ruler of the seas. Enterprise carried not just planes, but the morale of the Navy itself, a floating symbol of American resilience.\n\nThe British Lancaster bomber was the heavy hitter of the Royal Air Force, a night predator that struck deep into enemy territory. With its long wings and bomb bays, it could carry massive payloads and was trusted for the most dangerous missions.\n\nCrews often flew under moonlight and cloud cover, facing flak and fighters while keeping steady toward their targets. Perhaps its most famous mission was the daring “Dambusters” raid, which became a legend of ingenuity and courage. For many, the Lancaster represented Britain’s determination to hit back despite heavy losses.\n\nThe humble Jeep may not look as glamorous as a battleship or bomber, but it became one of the most beloved vehicles of the war. It was everywhere, carrying troops, hauling supplies, even serving as makeshift ambulances.\n\nSoldiers adored it for its toughness and simplicity, able to keep running through mud, sand, and rough terrain. The Jeep wasn’t about firepower, but about mobility, giving armies the ability to move fast and adapt. Its squat, boxy shape became instantly recognizable wherever Allied forces went.\n\nWhile not as intimidating as the Tiger, the Panzer IV was the true workhorse of Germany’s armored divisions. It fought in every theater of the war, proving versatile and adaptable to countless roles.\n\nGerman commanders relied on it heavily, knowing they could field it in large numbers. Its reputation wasn’t built on invincibility, but on consistency; it was always there, pushing the front lines forward. For Allied troops, facing a Panzer IV meant dealing with a determined and capable opponent.\n\nFew aircraft of World War II were as infamous as the Stuka dive bomber, its screaming sirens designed to terrify those below. German propaganda made the Stuka into a symbol of Blitzkrieg, a machine that delivered both destruction and dread.\n\nIts steep dive attacks were precise and shocking, leaving soldiers scrambling for cover. Early in the war, it seemed unstoppable, carving paths for advancing German forces. But as the skies grew more dangerous with Allied fighters, the Stuka became vulnerable.\n\nThe Soviet Katyusha rocket launcher was nicknamed “Stalin’s Organ” for the howling sound it made when firing. Mounted on trucks, it unleashed barrages of rockets that blanketed enemy positions in chaos.\n\nSoldiers described the experience as terrifying, both for those launching and those receiving the fire. Unlike traditional artillery, Katyushas could quickly move, strike, and vanish before counterattacks. Their power wasn’t in precision but in overwhelming force that rattled entire sectors.\n\nThe war ended generations ago, but the silhouettes of these machines are still etched in our minds. Whether it was the terrifying scream of a Stuka diving, the steady rumble of a Sherman column, or the towering presence of a battleship at sea, each one told a story larger than life.\n\nThese vehicles were characters in the grand part of history, and their stories remind us how innovation, ambition, and courage collided in a time of global upheaval. Today, we look back not to glorify war, but to understand how these machines became lasting legends. They are reminders of humanity’s power to build, to endure, and to remember. The steel has rusted, but the legends live on.",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — Almost four years into Russia’s full-scale war on Ukraine, European Union leaders have committed to funding Kyiv’s economic and military needs for the next two years, one way or another. Ukraine is desperate and needs the money by early 2026.\n\nAt a summit next week, the 27 EU leaders will weigh whether to use tens of billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets held in Europe to help meet Ukraine’s requirements, which the International Monetary Fund puts at 135 billion euros ($157 billion).\n\nSuch a move has never been done before, and it comes with risks. The European Central Bank has warned that if Europeans appear willing to grab other countries' money, it could undermine confidence in the euro currency. Some member nations are also concerned about inviting retaliation from Russia.\n\nBelgium, where most of the assets are held, is the main opponent of the plan. It’s fearful that Russia will strike back, either through the courts or in more nefarious ways. A series of drone incidents near airports and military bases last month suggested that the Kremlin was already doing so, but those responsible were never publicly identified.\n\nEuropean Council President Antonio Costa, who will chair the Dec. 18 summit, has insisted that the leaders should not leave EU headquarters in Brussels until they have reached a decision.\n\nEU leaders froze the money, most of it in Russian Central Bank assets, over the war that Putin launched in February 2022. Moscow has described the scheme as “theft.”\n\nTwo plans have emerged. The first would be a “reparations loan” that would use the Russian assets until Moscow agrees to pay for the damage inflicted on Ukraine. Few think Russian President Vladimir Putin will ever agree to pay reparations.\n\nPlan B would be for the EU to borrow the money on financial markets, much as the bloc did to fund a massive loan plan to revive European economies after the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMany of Europe’s major economies are cash strapped and mired in debt. But Russia’s war on Ukraine poses an existential threat to the bloc. Intelligence assessments suggest that Putin could launch a war elsewhere in three to five years should he defeat Ukraine.\n\nThe assets make up a substantial pot of potentially ready-to-use cash.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU’s executive branch, estimates that 210 billion ($244 billion) euros worth of frozen assets are currently held in Europe. The vast majority — around 193 billion euros ($225 billion) at the end of September — are held in the Belgian financial clearinghouse known as Euroclear.\n\nThere are political advantages too. Should the EU choose to use the assets, only “a qualified majority” of countries — around a two-thirds majority — would be required for a green light. Borrowing on financial markets would have to be endorsed by all, meaning that even a single no vote would sink the idea.\n\nOver the last year, Hungary has blocked EU support for Ukraine at almost every turn. The government in Slovakia is starting to dig in its heels as well. A new and stridently nationalist leader in the Czech Republic could further complicate the decision.\n\nAvoiding a veto is in the interest of the vast majority of member countries.\n\nDetails of the reparations loan\n\nUnveiling her plan on Dec. 4, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU would cover two-thirds of Ukraine’s needs for 2026 and 2027, for a total of 90 billion euros ($105 billion). International partners would fill the gap.\n\nDue to EU sanctions on Russia’s assets, cash balances have accumulated at Euroclear. They’ve generated interest — some 3.9 billion euros ($4.5 billion) this year, Euroclear says — which is already being used to fund a Group of Seven loan plan for Ukraine.\n\nUnder the new plan, some of the cash would be transferred to an EU debt instrument. Ukraine would owe the EU the money but would repay only after the bloc’s sanctions are lifted and after Russia agrees to pay war reparations.\n\nThe commission insists that there is no “theft,” as Russia has claimed, because the right of the Russian Central Bank to make a claim on its money and Euroclear’s duty to repay will remain intact.\n\nOnce Putin pays war reparations, Ukraine would repay the EU, the EU would repay Euroclear, and Euroclear would repay the Russian Central Bank.\n\nImportantly for Belgium, the plan contains safeguards to ensure that the risks would be shared by its partners. Other EU countries would offer to guarantee the loan if something went wrong. Germany has already signaled that it would do so.\n\nBut the Belgian government has not been assuaged. Even before the commission's reparations loan plan was made public, Foreign Minister Maxime Prévot said that it “entails consequential economic, financial and legal risks.”\n\nPrévot said Belgium — a strong backer of Ukraine that has provided military and financial support — feels that its concerns are not being heard by its EU partners.\n\n“We are not seeking to antagonize our partners or Ukraine. We are simply seeking to avoid potential disastrous consequences for a member state that is being asked to show solidarity without being offered the same solidarity in return,” he said.\n\nIn an interview with Belgian public broadcaster RTBF last week, Euroclear CEO Valerie Urbain also said that court action could not be ruled out should the EU oblige the clearinghouse to transfer its Russian assets.",

    "description": "The USS Arizona was one of the most historically significant warships in military history. The Navy just removed 150 tons of concrete from its remains.",
    "fullText": "After over 80 years in the water, the U.S. Navy has removed more than 150 tons of aging concrete mooring platforms from the USS Arizona. This move comes as the Navy and the Pearl Harbor National Memorial finish their months-long effort to protect and preserve the major U.S. Navy ship sunk during World War II. After years of planning, a team started this project in September 2025, taking the last of the two platforms from the water about a month later. Removing these concrete platforms was effectively the final step. Today, only small sections remain to avoid disturbing one of the most historically significant warships in military history.\n\nThe process involved using a crane barge and diamond wire saw to cut and lift concrete segments from the sunken battleship. Navy Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit 1 led the work alongside help from federal contractors. This was no small feat, as the team's schedule often involved many 12-to-14-hour days to get the job done on schedule.\n\nWhy now? Well, officials said the project addressed some long-standing concerns that the massive structures might eventually collapse through the USS Arizona's deteriorating decks. The concrete platforms were first installed after the attack at Pearl Harbor to support the salvage of guns and munitions. There they've remained ever since.\n\nSince it was an underwater job, several environmentalists were involved in the uninstallation process. Experts in marine resources, historic preservation, water quality, and water safety were on standby for continuous support. That way, the platforms could be removed without harming the surrounding harbor ecosystem, the memorial, or any of the people working to remove them in the first place.\n\nThe USS Arizona Memorial, managed by the National Park Service since 1980, spans the midsection of the sunken battleship and is accessible only by boat. Built in 1962, it serves as both a national monument and the final resting place for those hundreds of sailors and Marines who died aboard the ship — not to mention any survivors who later chose to have their ashes interred there. This major undertaking helps make sure the memorial is no longer under threat of damage, allowing future generations to still visit the U.S. battleship for years to come.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

Israel has banned international journalists from entering Gaza since the war began more than two years ago, except for rare, brief visits supervised by the military, such as this one.",
    "fullText": "RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — One by one, the soldiers squeezed through a narrow entrance to a tunnel in southern Gaza. Inside a dark hallway, some bowed their heads to avoid hitting the low ceiling, while watching their step as they walked over or around jagged concrete, crushed plastic bottles and tattered mattresses.\n\nOn Monday, Israel's military took journalists into Rafah — the city at Gaza's southernmost point that troops seized last year and largely flattened — as the 2-month-old Israel-Hamas ceasefire reaches a critical point. Israel has banned international journalists from entering Gaza since the war began more than two years ago, except for rare, brief visits supervised by the military, such as this one.\n\nSoldiers escorted journalists inside a tunnel, which they said was one of Hamas' most significant and complex underground routes, connecting cities in the embattled territory and used by top Hamas commanders. Israel said Hamas had kept the body of a hostage in the underground passage: Hadar Goldin, a 23-year-old soldier who was killed in Gaza more than a decade ago and whose remains had been held there.\n\nHamas returned Goldin's body last month as part of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in the war triggered by the militants' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and hundreds taken hostage. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 70,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which operates under the Hamas-run government. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but says roughly half the dead have been women and children.\n\nIsrael and Hamas are on the cusp of finishing the first phase of the truce, which mandated the return of all hostages, living and dead, in exchange for Palestinians held by Israel. The body of just one more hostage remains to be returned.\n\nMediators warn the second phase will be far more challenging since it includes thornier issues, such as disarming Hamas and Israel’s withdrawal from the strip. Israel currently controls more than half of Gaza.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to travel to Washington this month to discuss those next steps with U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nPiles of rubble line Rafah's roads\n\nLast year, Israel launched a major operation in Rafah, where many Palestinians had sought refuge from offensives elsewhere. Heavy fighting left much of the city in ruins and displaced nearly one million Palestinians. This year, when the military largely had control of the city, it systematically demolished most of the buildings that remained standing, according to satellite photos.\n\nTroops also took control of and shut the vital Rafah crossing, Gaza’s only gateway to the outside world that was not controlled by Israel.\n\nIsrael said Rafah was Hamas’ last major stronghold and key to dismantling the group’s military capabilities, a major war aim.\n\nOn the drive around Rafah on Monday, towers of mangled concrete, wires and twisted metal lined the roads, with few buildings still standing and none unscathed. Remnants of people's lives were scattered the ground: a foam mattress, towels and a book explaining the Quran.\n\nLast week, Israel said it was ready to reopen the Rafah crossing but only for people to leave the strip. Egypt and many Palestinians fear that once people leave, they won't be allowed to return. They say Israel is obligated to open the crossing in both directions.\n\nIsrael has said that entry into Gaza would not be permitted until Israel receives all hostages remaining in the strip.\n\nThe tunnel that journalists were escorted through runs beneath what was once a densely populated residential neighborhood, under a United Nations compound and mosques. Today, Rafah is a ghost town. Underground, journalists picked their way around dangling cables and uneven concrete slabs covered in sand.\n\nThe army says the tunnel is more than 7 kilometers (4 miles) long and up to 25 meters (82 feet) deep and was used for storing weapons as well as long-term stays. It said top Hamas commanders were there during the war, including Mohammed Sinwar — who was believed to have run Hamas’ armed wing and was the younger brother of Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who helped mastermind the Oct. 7 attack. Israel has said it has killed both of them.\n\n“What we see right here is a perfect example of what Hamas did with all the money and the equipment that was brought into Gaza throughout the years,\" said Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani. \"Hamas took it and built an incredible city underground for the purposes of terror and holding bodies of hostages.”\n\nIsrael has long accused Hamas of siphoning off money for military purposes. While Hamas says the Palestinians are an occupied people and have a right to resist, the group also has a civilian arm and ran a government that provided services such as health care, a police force and education.\n\nThe army hasn’t decided what to do with the tunnel. It could seal it with concrete, explode it or hold it for intelligence purposes among other options.\n\nSince the ceasefire began, three soldiers have been killed in clashes with about 200 Hamas militants that Israeli and Egyptian officials say remain underground in Israeli-held territory.\n\nHamas has said communication with its remaining units in Rafah has been cut off for months and that it was not responsible for any incidents occurring in those areas.\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas have accused each other of repeated violations of the deal during the first phase. Israel has accused Hamas of dragging out the hostage returns, while Palestinian health officials say over 370 Palestinians have been killed in continued Israeli strikes since the ceasefire took effect.\n\nEditor's Note: This article was submitted for review by Israel’s military censor, which made no changes.",

    "fullText": "ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan’s newly appointed armed forces chief called on Afghanistan’s Taliban government on Monday to choose between maintaining ties with Islamabad or supporting the Pakistani Taliban, the militant group blamed for a surge in deadly attacks in recent years.\n\nGen. Asim Munir made his remarks at his headquarters in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, where he received a guard of honor from all three branches of the military, marking the launch of Pakistan’s new joint military command.\n\nHis appointment was confirmed last week in what officials said would improve coordination among the army, navy and air force, amid shifting regional security dynamics.\n\nMunir said that the new Defence Forces Headquarters marks a historic step, creating a unified tri-services command to boost coordination across land, air, sea, cybersecurity and information domains amid rising security threats, according to a military statement.\n\nMunir told officers that a “clear message” had been delivered to the Taliban government in Kabul: it must decide between Pakistan and “Fitna al-Khawarij,” a term authorities use for the outlawed Pakistani Taliban, known a s Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP.\n\nThe TTP, though separate, is closely aligned with the Afghan Taliban and has been emboldened since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Kabul.\n\nRelations between the two neighbors have deteriorated since October, when several days of border clashes killed dozens of soldiers, civilians and suspected militants and wounded hundreds more. The violence followed Oct. 9 explosions in Kabul that Taliban authorities blamed on Pakistan. A Qatar-mediated ceasefire has largely held since October, though they failed to reach an agreement in November, despite holding three rounds of talks in Istanbul.\n\nMunir has risen to prominence since earlier this year, when Pakistan said it repelled India in a four-day conflict. The two nuclear-armed rivals exchanged tit-for-tat strikes in May after India targeted militants inside Pakistan, accusing them of involvement in the massacre of 26 tourists in India-controlled Kashmir.\n\nThe confrontation eased only after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that India and Pakistan had agreed to a “full and immediate ceasefire.”\n\nMunir said the operations during the conflict have become a “textbook example” of future warfare. He also presented awards to Pakistan navy and air force personnel for their roles in the fighting.\n\nMunir said that “India must remain under no illusion that Pakistan’s next response will be even swifter and more severe.” He said that Pakistan is a peace-loving country, “but no one will be allowed to test its resolve regarding sovereignty, territorial integrity, peace or stability.”\n\nPakistan and India have a long history of bitter relations and have fought three of their wars over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir since gaining independence from British rule in 1947.",
