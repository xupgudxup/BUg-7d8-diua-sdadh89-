    "description": "Think GPS runs the world? China's BeiDou is a fast-rising rival with military and disaster uses, plus a rapidly expanding satellite and ground network.",
    "fullText": "The term \"GPS\" has become ubiquitous in American life. You know it as the foundational technology of navigation apps like Google Maps and Waze, but in most of the world, GPS is just a meaningless trio of letters. The Global Positioning System is owned and operated by the U.S. military, and it is just one of many Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in operation around the world. In the European Union, people find their way with help from a GNSS called Galileo. In Russia, they use GLONASS (GLObal NAvigation Satellite System). Japan has QZSS (Quasi-Zenith Satellite System), commonly known as Michibiki. But there's one system that matters more than people realize: China's BeiDou isn't just a GPS alternative, it's a fast-growing platform with uses that go far beyond navigation.\n\nThe first BeiDou satellites launched in 2000, and by 2020, it had achieved global coverage. Just like America's GPS, BeiDou is owned and operated by its home government, and the ruling Chinese Communist Party has kept most of its technological specifications secret. However, BeiDou has caught the attention of other governments, particularly the United States, due to its wide-ranging uses. BeiDou does a lot more than guide people on their way to work. Just as GPS is closely tied into the American military, BeiDou is becoming ingrained in China's military operations, used by guided missiles and bombs. It's also being used for monitoring and responding to natural disasters. BeiDou is already more advanced than GPS in many ways, and it's grown at a stunning pace.\n\nBeiDou is much younger than GPS, which first launched in 1978 and achieved full coverage in 1993. However, the Chinese government has pursued progress on its GNSS much more aggressively than the United States. BeiDou was born with a competitive spirit, as part of a push to bolster China's military wing, the People's Liberation Army, at the end of the last century.\n\nA defining moment for China's GNSS ambitions came amidst the 1996 Taiwan Strait missile crisis, when tensions between the Chinese and Taiwanese governments led to the PLA conducting a series of missile tests in the East China Sea. During one of the tests, the Chinese missiles missed their targets badly. They had been relying on a GPS signal that went out, and Chinese officials later suggested the signal had been disrupted. The CCP resolved at that moment to develop a GNSS independent of, and superior to, the Americans'. From the beginning, national defense, and particularly missile guidance, was at the forefront of BeiDou.\n\nSince the 2010s, BeiDou has played a major role in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a massive infrastructure project aimed at expanding trade routes across the Eastern Hemisphere. In the process, China has begun heavily promoting BeiDou on the international scale. Their partnership with the military of Pakistan in 2018 drew particular attention. Amidst a steady air of tension between Beijing and Washington, China's ability to fortify its allies' militaries will have immense geopolitical consequences in any form of conflict.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States has been steadily rolling out GPS III. It will be an upgrade over the currently available GPS system, but it will probably still fall short of BeiDou on most fronts. GPS III will add more satellites to the GPS constellation, but the new satellites are only an incremental upgrade over what's already in use. In fact, GPS III was originally intended to launch in 2014, so the system is already outdated in some ways — and the first satellites for its planned successor, GPS IIIF, aren't scheduled to launch until Spring 2027.\n\nBeiDou has raised alarms within the U.S. government amidst a tight competition with Beijing for tech superiority that has already shown the Chinese can outmatch our drone technology. Perhaps the most concerning comment about BeiDou came from within the U.S. government itself, in a memo from former Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen from 2023, which plainly said, \"GPS's capabilities are now substantially inferior to those of China's BeiDou.\"\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "description": "As the Pentagon struggles with financial accountability, the Marines have passed their third audit in a row.",
    "fullText": "The Marine Corps has again done what the rest of the US military has repeatedly failed to do with its finances — account for its money.\n\nThe Corps, the only US military service to pass a clean financial audit, announced its third successful audit on Monday.\n\nThe Department of Defense, which was recently authorized to receive a new annual budget of nearly $840 billion a year and could see a substantial increase to $1.5 trillion under the current Trump administration, has consistently failed to pass an audit since audits became legally required for the military in 2018.\n\nPentagon officials hope the military can get its books in order across the services and pass one by 2028.\n\n\"The Marine Corps' audit process enabled accurate global tracking and reporting of financial transactions, inventory of facilities, equipment and assets, and accounting for taxpayer dollars spent during the last fiscal year,\" read a Marine Corps release, \"The auditors also tested the Marine Corps' network, key business systems, and internal controls.\"\n\nThe result reflects years of effort to modernize financial and logistics systems that have long been siloed across units, making audits agonizingly challenging, said Lt. Gen. James Adams III, the deputy commandant for programs and resources, during a media roundtable. Such bottlenecks have been a long-standing problem across the Defense Department and are a major focus of Pentagon reforms.\n\n\"We want to modernize our systems so they're digitally connected, so that we can do audits in the future that are controls-based,\" said Adams, who is set to depart his position soon to lead the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n\nHistorically, fragmented military networks have made everything from force-wide equipment tracking to financial oversight difficult, requiring tedious manual reconciliations. While the Corps still relies heavily on human review, officials say automation and artificial intelligence are already reducing the burden.\n\n\"Right now, we still take a lot of data and move it onto a macro spreadsheet that our accountants are reviewing, and that's just a lot of work,\" said Edward Gardiner, the assistant deputy commandant for programs and resources. AI tools can help flag discrepancies and pinpoint errors, he said. Officials pointed to one automation system that saved 20,000 hours of painful reconciliation work.\n\nAuditors still found seven \"areas of weakness\" in the audit, a common feature even among organizations with clean audits, though Adams told reporters the Corps has prioritized fixes to those areas that pose the greatest risk to financial accuracy after its audits, rather than trying to eliminate all concerns at once.\n\n\"Passing our third consecutive audit is a direct reflection of who we are as Marines,\" the Corps' commandant, Gen. Eric Smith, said in a statement. \"Discipline, accountability, and stewardship are not administrative tasks; they are part of our warfighting culture.\"",

    "title": "This Sci-Fi US Navy Destroyer Is $8 Billion Of Military Tech Floating At Sea",
    "description": "Right out of a sci-fi movie, this US Navy stealth ship comes with an $8 billion price tag and an incredible level of high-tech weaponry and capability.",
    "fullText": "When the U.S. Navy commissioned its Zumwalt-class destroyer (DDG-1000) in 2016, it hailed the warship as the most advanced surface combatant in the world. Equipped with a state-of-the-art stealth design, revolutionary electric propulsion and integrated power mechanisms, and twin Advanced Gun Systems, the 16,000-ton Zumwalt was touted as being larger, more advanced, and more difficult to detect than any destroyer the world had ever seen.\n\nHowever, several shortcomings, including runaway costs and underwhelming performance, caused the Navy to reduce order numbers from the proposed 32 to three, raising doubts in the Navy's ability to deliver advanced warships. Ultimately, the Zumwalt suffered from two major problems. The first was its incredible cost, as the $8 billion per-ship price tag made it impractical for largescale manufacturing and deployment. Second, its advanced designs were poorly suited for the Navy's intended usage as a land support ship, where stealth features are less important. As such, U.S. leadership determined the Zumwalt was an expensive square peg for the Navy's shore-support round hole, rendering it a floating money pit without a definitive mission.\n\nThis disconnect prompted the U.S. Navy to begin the arduous task of updating its most expensive destroyer, replacing the 155mm guns with hypersonic missiles. The first ship of its kind to sport an intercontinental missile system, the Zumwalt is one of a host of global destroyers adding high-tech weapons systems to address a changing threat landscape. The update recasts the Zumwalt as part of the U.S.'s long range strike operations, an increasingly important strategic priority, perhaps best exemplified by the nuclear missile test in November 2025. Having completed a round of post-modernization sea trials in January 2026, this sci-fi stealth ship may finally be ready to take its place at the head of U.S. Naval strategy.\n\nWhen the DDG-1000 was commissioned, it was lauded for its novel stealth designs. Despite constituting an approximate 40% jump in size from its Arleigh Burke-class predecessor, the 610-foot Zumwalt's radar cross section matches that of a 50-foot fishing vessel. Employing many of the same stealth design principles of fighter jets, the Zumwalt eschewed typical design structures, instead using an angular, wave-piercing tumblehome hull and a deckhouse constructed of electromagnetic wave-absorbing composite materials to lower the ship's radar footprint.\n\nAdd acoustics that more closely resemble a submarine, and the Zumwalt is roughly 50 times more clandestine than the Arleigh Burke destroyers. Another major development was the Zumwalt's electric propulsion system. Powered by a revolutionary integrated power network, it's capable of generating 78 megawatts, nearly as much as a nuclear aircraft carrier.\n\nThe massive size allows the Zumwalt to host a diverse array of aircraft, including Joint Strike Fighters, drones, and MV-22 Osprey, initially seen as a boon for its position alongside amphibious and littoral combat ships. To support these near-shore operations, the ship was equipped with two 155mm Advanced Gun Systems (AGS). With a range of 62 nautical miles, the Navy intended the AGS' Long-Range Land Attack Projectiles to fill the Naval Surface Fire Support void left by the 1992 retirement of the Iowa-class battleship.\n\nUnfortunately, the technological advancements of the Navy's sci-fi stealth ship came at a price. Over its 11-year development, costs skyrocketed to$23 billion. To put such astronomical numbers in perspective, the US Navy's new nuclear supercarrier, the Gerald R. Ford-class, costs $13 billion. Ammunition alone proved a financial disaster for the Zumwalt, as each round cost over $800,000, forcing a purchase cut from 20,000 to 2,400 units.\n\nFurther complicating things, the Zumwalt's expensive stealth advancements were ill-suited for the Navy's planned near-shore use, where crowded waterways and clear sightlines nullify much of its anti-radar capability. Between rising costs and competing design priorities, Naval planners largely viewed the Zumwalt-class destroyers as an expensive ship without a mission. Since canceling its ammunition order, however, the Navy has begun to reorient the Zumwalt away from close shore combat and towards clandestine operations and long range missile strikes.\n\nThis repurposing began in August 2023, when the DDG-1000 underwent a 3-year modernization effort.  Part of which involved replacing the Advanced Gun Systems with a state-of-the-art Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) weapons system that carries Common Hypersonic Glide Bodies capable of worldwide range at speeds up to Mach 5. Through these efforts, the Navy hopes that the CPS system will shift the Zumwalt-class destroyer into a key cog of its global force-projection efforts, particularly in the Pacific theatre.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "description": "Somali president promises to confront Israeli military presence amid reports of base plan in breakaway Somaliland.",
    "fullText": "Somalian President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud has slammed Israel’s “interference” in his country, saying its recognition of the breakaway region of Somaliland has further increased instability and weakened international order.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Al Jazeera broadcast on Saturday, Mohamud said Somalia “will never allow” the establishment of an Israeli base in Somaliland and will “confront” any such move.\n\nHe also warned that the proposed Israeli base could be used as a springboard to attack neighbouring countries.\n\nMohamud’s comments came amid a regional outcry over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision in December to recognise Somaliland, a breakaway part of Somalia comprising the northwestern portion of what was once the British Protectorate.\n\nThe territory sits astride one of the world’s most critical maritime choke routes, flanked by multiple conflicts in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East.\n\nIsrael’s move made it the first country in the world to recognise Somaliland as an independent state and came months after The Associated Press news agency reported that Israeli officials had contacted parties in Somaliland to discuss using the territory for forcibly displacing Palestinians amid Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.\n\nIsrael and Somaliland have denied the claims, but a Somaliland official from the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation told Israel’s Channel 12 in January that an Israeli military base is “on the table and being discussed”, though its establishment depends on the terms.\n\nSomalia has denounced Israel’s move as an attack on its territorial integrity and unity, a position backed by most African and Arab leaders, and urged Netanyahu to withdraw the recognition.\n\nBut Somaliland’s leader, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, known as Cirro, has welcomed Israel’s diplomatic move, praising Netanyahu for his “leadership and commitment to promoting stability and peace” in the region.\n\nIn his interview with Al Jazeera, Mohamud described Israel’s diplomatic manoeuvre as a “reckless, fundamentally wrong and illegal action under international law”.\n\nHe also pledged to fight back against any Israeli military presence in Somaliland.\n\n“We will fight in our capacity. Of course, we will defend ourselves,” he said. “And that means that we will confront any Israeli forces coming in, because we are against that and we will never allow that.”\n\nThe Israeli recognition represents a dramatic shift in Somaliland’s fortunes after years of diplomatic isolation.\n\nThe region seceded from Somalia during a brutal civil war that followed decades under the hardline government of Siad Barre, whose forces devastated the north. While large parts of Somalia descended into chaos, Somaliland stabilised by the late 1990s.\n\nSomaliland has since developed a distinct political identity, with its own currency, flag and parliament. But its eastern regions remain disputed by communities that do not back the separatist programme in the capital, Hargeisa.\n\nIn recent years, Somaliland developed ties with the United Arab Emirates – a signatory to the Abraham Accords with Israel – and Taiwan as it sought international acceptance.\n\nIn his interview, Mohamud said Israel’s move “interfering with Somalia’s sovereign and territorial integrity” also “undermines stability, security and trade in a way that affects the whole of Africa, the Red Sea and the wider world”.\n\nHe added that Israel’s deadly use of force against Palestinians in Gaza cannot be separated from what is happening in Somaliland, adding that it reflects the weakening of the foundations of global governance.\n\n“Key among the global concerns is the weakening of the established rules-based international order. That order is not intact any more,” Mohamud said.\n\nHe warned that institutions created after World War II “are under grave threat”, as “the mighty is right” increasingly replaces adherence to international law.\n\nThe United States, meanwhile, has yet to signal a major shift on the question of Somaliland.\n\nBut in August, US President Donald Trump – who has previously lobbed insults at Somalia and Mohamud – suggested he was preparing to move on the issue when asked about Somaliland during a White House news conference.\n\n“Another complex one, but we’re working on that one – Somaliland,” he said.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Singapore (AP) — This week’s Singapore Air Show brought together trade delegations from around the world to show off the latest in civilian and military aviation technology.\n\nThe event this year marked the 10th edition of the air show, which showcased cutting-edge planes from the Royal Australian Air Force and the United States Air Force. This included the F-35 Lightning II, the latest U.S.-made fifth-generation fighter jet that has integrated stealth technology and is considered one of the world’s most advanced combat aircraft.\n\nMajor commercial plane makers also touted the latest advancements in their fleets, including Airbus, Bombardier, Gulfstream, Boeing and China’s Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, known as COMAC.\n\n“We have a very good representation of the latest and the greatest,” said Leck Chet Lam, managing director of Experia Events, which organizes the event. “The Singapore Air Show, the unique part of it is we cover both the aviation and also the defense industries.”\n\nDuring the Singapore Air Show's aerial displays, COMAC promoted its C919 passenger jet, which China is pushing as an alternative to the European Airbus A320neo and the American Boeing 737 MAX. The daily aerial displays at the event also showcased six military teams and Airbus’ A350-1000.\n\nWithin the exhibition hall, the air show featured experimental air taxis, advanced flight simulators, a wide variety of drones and both manned and unmanned helicopters. The static aircraft display under Singapore’s sizzling sun included roughly 35 planes from more than 10 countries.\n\nIn all, more than 1,000 companies from around 50 countries participated in the air show, hosted on the grounds of Changi International Airport, Southeast Asia's busiest airport. The event, which opened on Feb. 3, is considered Asia’s largest aerospace and defense exhibition and runs through Feb. 8.\n\n“All the exhibitors can use Singapore as a springboard to then tap into the opportunities that are rising in the Asia-Pacific market, which is a key driver that is driving the growth of the global aviation industry,\" Lam said.\n\nThis is a photo gallery curated by AP photo editors.",

    "title": "Hunt For Container Launchers Packed With Drones Kicked-Off By Pentagon",
    "description": "The U.S. military wants proposals for containerized systems that can launch and recover a mixture of drone swarms on land and sea.",
    "fullText": "The entire U.S. military is now pushing to acquire hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of new drones, especially smaller types, in the coming years, spurred on by new direction from the Pentagon. In turn, a demand for new containerized launchers capable of rapidly deploying and, if need be, recovering those uncrewed aerial systems has now emerged. On several occasions in the past, TWZ has called attention to the value of exactly these kinds of launch capabilities, for use on land and at sea, especially for employing fully networked swarms.\n\nEarlier this week, the Pentagon’s Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) laid out broad requirements for what it referred to as a Containerized Autonomous Drone Delivery System (CADDS). DIU’s central focus is on leveraging new and improved commercial-off-the-shelf technologies to help meet U.S. military needs.\n\n“The Department of War (DoW) faces a robotic mass challenge: current methods for deploying and sustaining unmanned aerial systems (UAS) rely on direct human interaction to launch, recover, and refit each system,” the CADDS notice explains. “This 1:1 operator-to-aircraft model limits deployment speed and scale while exposing operators to unnecessary risks.”\n\nThe “problem” to solve then is that “the DoW requires the ability to deploy large quantities of UAS rapidly, while minimizing the risk and burden to human operators executing kinetic and non-kinetic UAS operations in contested environments,” it adds.\n\nTo that end, “DOW seeks innovative solutions that enable the storage, rapid deployment, and management of multi-agent systems to provide either persistent UAS coverage over extended periods or massed effects within a single geographic region and time,” per DIU. It needs to be “employable from land and maritime platforms, in both day and night conditions, and during inclement weather.”\n\nThese have to be “designs [that] can be transported by military or commercial vehicles (land, sea, air)” and that “can be quickly positioned and made operational with minimal handling or setup.” They also have to be able to provide “automated functions for drone storage, launching, recovering, and refitting within the containerized platform; the intent is for the system to exist in a dormant state for a period of time and launch UAS upon command.”\n\nDIU does not name any particular drones that the CADDS has to be able to accommodate or say how many UASs a single launcher should be able to hold. The notice does say the system will need to support “homogeneous and heterogeneous mixes of Government-directed UAS.”\n\nThe launch system also has to be capable of being set up and broken back down in a time frame measured in minutes and have a small operational footprint. “Ideally, the system should require a crew of no more than 2 personnel,” per DIU.\n\nWhen it comes to the “autonomous” element of the launch system, DIU says it needs to support “both operator-on-the-loop and operator-in-the-loop decision-making processes.”\n\nThe market space for containerized launchers for various payloads, and for use on land and at sea, has been steadily growing globally in recent years. There has already been a further trend in the development of such systems for launching loitering munitions and other uncrewed aerial systems, or the adaptation of existing designs to be able to do so.\n\nAs one example, in the past year or so, Northrop Grumman has begun touting the ability of what it is currently calling the Modular Payload System (MPS) to launch drones, as seen in the computer-generated video below. TWZ was first to report on the development of that system all the way back in 2018, when it was being presented solely as a way to surface-launch variants of the AGM-88 anti-radiation missile. MPS is also now being pitched as a launcher for the Advanced Reactive Strike Missile (AReS), a surface-to-surface missile derived from the AGM-88G Advanced Anti-radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range (AARGM-ER) and its Stand-in Attack Weapon (SiAW) cousin.\n\nLast year, another concept for a containerized launcher capable of holding up to 48 drones at once also emerged from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Japan. Back in 2024, Germany’s Rheinmetall and UVision in Israel had also unveiled two very similar designs, specifically for launching members of the latter company’s Hero series of loitering munitions.\n\nA containerized “drone launch vehicle” based on a 10-ton truck, capable of carrying and launching up to 48 attack drones, as showcased by\n\nMitsubishi Heavy Industries. https://t.co/DlkG1X0OLLhttps://t.co/0vhaWlpRwopic.twitter.com/khFY25YESx\n\n— 笑脸男人 (@lfx160219) December 19, 2025\n\nThis is just a small selection of the designs that have been seen to date. Firms in China have been particularly active in this regard, and developments in that country have often also been tied to work on swarming capabilities.\n\nContainer-like launchers for uncrewed aerial systems, often mounted on trucks, have already been in service in many countries for years. This includes Iran, where they are used to launch Shahed-type kamikaze drones, as can be seen in the video below.\n\nHowever, many of these systems are focused squarely on the launch aspect and lack the recovery and refit capabilities that DIU has outlined for CADDS. Chinese drone firm DJI and others in the commercial space are increasingly offering container-like ‘docks,’ but which are often designed to accommodate just one uncrewed aerial system at a time.\n\nWhat is particularly interesting here is how many of the stated CADDS requirements actually sound very similar, at least in very broad strokes, to a containerized system capable of launching, recovering, and recharging thousands of small, electrically-powered quadcopter-type drones at the touch of a button that the Chinese company DAMODA rolled out last year. That launcher, dubbed the Automated Drone Swarm Container System, is for drone light shows for entertainment purposes rather than military use.\n\nIt is worth reiterating that DAMODA’s Automated Drone Swarm Container System, at least as it exists now, is clearly designed for entertainment industry use first and foremost. Though the company’s drone light show routines are certainly visually impressive and often go viral on social media, they are pre-scripted and conducted in a very localized fashion. What the company is offering is not a drone swarm capable of performing various military-minded tasks in a highly autonomous manner at appreciable ranges from its launch point.\n\nAt the same time, large-scale drone light shows put on by DAMODA (and a growing number of other companies), do highlight, on a broad level, the already highly problematic threats posed by swarms. The new Automated Drone Swarm Container System underscores the additional danger of these same threats hiding in plain sight. The steady proliferation of advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, especially when it comes to dynamic targeting, will only create additional challenges, as TWZ has explored in detail in this past feature.\n\nThis is not theoretical, either. As mentioned, in June [2025], Ukrainian forces launched multiple drone attacks on airbases across Russia with the help of covert launchers loaded on the back of unassuming civilian tractor-trailer trucks. This entire effort was dubbed Operation Spiderweb and took months of planning.\n\n5/\n\n5. After launching, the trailers self-destructed to avoid detection or recovery . pic.twitter.com/DWZo4HlOfa\n\nEven in an overt operational context, readily deployable containerized systems capable of acting as hubs for drone operations across a broad area with limited manpower requirements could offer a major boost in capability and capacity. Ships, trucks, and aircraft, which could themselves be uncrewed, could be used to bring them to and from forward locations, even in remote areas. If they can support a “heterogeneous mix” of uncrewed aerial systems, a single container could be used to support a wide array of mission requirements, including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, electronic warfare, kinetic strikes, and/or communications signal relay.\n\nAn inherent benefit of a drone swarm, in general, is that each individual component does not have to be configured to perform all of the desired tasks. This creates additional flexibility and resilience to threats, since the loss of any particular drone does not necessarily preclude the swarm from continuing its assigned missions. There are tangential design and cost benefits for the drones themselves, since they can be configured to carry only the systems required for their particular mission demands.\n\nTWZ previously laid out a detailed case for the many benefits that could come along with loading containers packed with swarms of drones onto U.S. Navy ships. Many of those arguments are just as relevant when talking about systems designed to be employed on land. Containerized systems are often readily adaptable to both ground-based and maritime applications, to begin with.\n\nDrone swarms are only set to become more capable as advancements in autonomy, especially automated target recognition, continue to progress, driven by parallel developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning, as you can read more about here. Future highly autonomous swarms will be able to execute various mission sets even more efficiently and in ways that compound challenges for defenders. Massed drone attacks with limited autonomy already have an inherent capacity to just overwhelm enemy defenses. In turn, electronic warfare systems and high-power microwave directed energy weapons have steadily emerged as some of the most capable options available to tackle swarms, but have their own limitations. Even powerful microwave systems have very short ranges and are directional in nature, and electronic warfare systems may simply not work at all against autonomous drones.\n\nIn terms of what DIU is now looking at for CADDS, the stated requirements are broad. It remains to be seen what options might be submitted, let alone considered for actual operational U.S. military use.\n\nStill, DIU has laid out a real emerging capability gap amid the current push to field various tiers of drones to a degree never before seen across America’s armed forces, which counterinsurgency launch systems look well-positioned to fill.\n\nContact the author: joe@twz.com",

    "fullText": "The Pentagon said Friday it is cutting ties with Harvard University, ending all military training, fellowships and certificate programs with the Ivy League institution.\n\nThe announcement marks the latest development in the Trump administration’s prolonged standoff with Harvard over the White House’s demands for reforms at the Ivy League school.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a statement Friday that Harvard “no longer meets the needs of the War Department or the military services.\"\n\n“For too long, this department has sent our best and brightest officers to Harvard, hoping the university would better understand and appreciate our warrior class,” Hegseth said. “Instead, too many of our officers came back looking too much like Harvard — heads full of globalist and radical ideologies that do not improve our fighting ranks.”\n\nIn a separate post on X, Hegseth wrote, “Harvard is woke; The War Department is not.”\n\nStarting with the 2026-27 academic year, the Pentagon will discontinue graduate-level professional military education, fellowships and certificate programs, the statement said. Personnel currently attending classes at Harvard will be able to finish those courses.\n\nSimilar programs at other Ivy League universities will be evaluated in coming weeks, Hegseth said.\n\nHegseth earned a master's degree from Harvard but symbolically returned his diploma in a 2022 Fox News segment. A Pentagon social media account run by Hegseth’s office resurfaced the clip in which Hegseth, then a Fox News commentator, returned the diploma and wrote “Return to Sender” on it with a marker.\n\nThe military offers its officers a variety of opportunities to get graduate-level education both at war colleges run by the military as well as civilian institutions like Harvard.\n\nBroadly, while opportunities to attend prestigious civilian schools offer less direct benefit to a servicemember’s military career than their civilian counterparts, they help make troops more attractive employees once they leave the military.\n\nHarvard has long been President Donald Trump’s top target in his administration’s campaign to bring the nation’s most prestigious universities to heel. His officials have cut billions of dollars in Harvard’s federal research funding and attempted to block it from enrolling foreign students after the campus rebuffed a series of government demands last April.\n\nThe White House has said it’s punishing Harvard for tolerating anti-Jewish bias on campus. Harvard leaders argue they're facing illegal retaliation for failing to adopt the administration's ideological views. Harvard sued the administration in a pair of lawsuits. A federal judge issued orders siding with Harvard in both cases. The administration is appealing.\n\nTensions had eased over the summer as Trump teased a deal that he said was just days away. It never materialized and on Monday the president dug deeper, demanding $1 billion from Harvard as part of any deal to restore federal funding. That's twice what he had demanded before.\n\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations. AP is solely responsible for all content.

    "fullText": "GAZA CITY (AP) — On a rare day off from covering the war in Gaza, Associated Press photographer Jehad Alshrafi made sure to take his camera before heading out.\n\nSo when the Israeli military ordered the evacuation of people living near a Gaza City intersection Friday afternoon and warned of an impending airstrike, Alshrafi was ready.\n\nHis photos capture the staggering impact of an Israeli bomb in split-second detail.\n\nIn a post on social media, an Israeli military spokesman identified the target as a building used by Hamas militants. Warned to keep back at least 300 meters (about 980 feet), Alshrafi headed for a cemetery with a view of the site.\n\n“I saw the evacuation order on the internet and went directly to the place,” Alshrafi said.\n\nIt’s common for people in Gaza to visit cemeteries on Friday to pay respect to lost family members. With space between the headstones busy with mourners, Alshrafi set up at the far end of the cemetery, “because I know that sometimes the explosions are very strong, so we need to always stay vigilant.”\n\nHis images reinforce that very real danger. In the first, an Israeli bomb is frozen in midair, just a few feet from striking its target, as cemetery visitors turn to flee.\n\nIn the frames that follow, an immense plume of flames and smoke erupts from the structure. Debris sprays skyward. The building staggers before collapsing on itself.\n\nThe experience of bearing witness and the images it produced are searing. “The explosion was loud and strong beyond imagination,” Alshrafi said. “It was incredibly violent.”\n\nThis is a photo gallery curated by AP photo editors.",

    "fullText": "A high-profile general in Russia's military has been shot several times and wounded in Moscow.\n\nLt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev, 64, was taken to hospital after the attack in a residential block of flats in the north-western outskirts of the capital, and is believed to be in a serious condition. The attacker fled the scene.\n\nAlexeyev is number two in the main directorate of Russia's GRU military intelligence and the latest high-ranking military figure to have been targeted in or near Moscow since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nNo-one has so far claimed the attack, but senior Russian officials immediately blamed Ukraine, saying it was trying to derail negotiations to end the war.\n\n\"The victim has been taken to one of the city's hospitals,\" said Svetlana Petrenko of Russia's Investigations Committee (SK), which said it opened a criminal case for attempted murder.\n\nInvestigators are searching CCTV footage for clues and began interviewing potential witnesses of the attack on Friday morning on Volokolamsk Highway.\n\nA neighbour of Alexeyev told the Reuters news agency she had been woken by the sound of \"several\" shots and had then heard another neighbour screaming for help.\n\n\"This is all I heard. Other neighbours rushed out, too. They asked how they could help, should they call ambulance and police, but she had already called them.\"\n\nAlexeyev has played a significant role during the war in Ukraine, taking part in talks with Ukraine during the Russian siege of the city of Mariupol in 2022.\n\nEarlier he was awarded the title Hero of Russia for the role he played in Moscow's military intervention in Syria's civil war.\n\nHe was placed under European Union and UK sanctions after the GRU was accused of being behind the 2018 nerve agent attack in Salisbury in the UK.\n\nHe was also sent to negotiate with the head of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who led a short and bloody mutiny in June 2023.\n\nHis boss at the GRU, Igor Kostyukov, has been in charge of Russia's negotiating team at peace talks with Ukrainian and US teams in Abu Dhabi. The latest round ended on Thursday without a major breakthrough.\n\nIt is not yet known who was behind the shooting - but Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quick to accuse Ukraine.\n\nHe said \"this terrorist act\" was aimed at \"disrupting the negotiation process\".\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Vladimir Putin was being briefed on the shooting. \"We wish first of all that the general survives and recovers. We hope that will be the case,\" Peskov told reporters.\n\nUkraine has not commented but has claimed some attacks on Russian military figures in the past. Russian intelligence officials claimed they had thwarted an attempted attack on a Russian soldier in St Petersburg at the end of last month.\n\nAn Uzbek man was jailed in January for the 2024 killing of another general, Igor Kirillov, in an explosion outside a block of flats in Moscow. Sources in Ukraine's SBU intelligence said at the time it was behind the attack.\n\nLt Gen Kirillov had been in charge of Russia's Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection troops.\n\nIn December 2025, another high-ranking officer in the GRU, Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov, was killed when an explosive device detonated under a car in Moscow. He was in charge of the armed force's operational training department, according to Russia's SK.",

    "description": "The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Thursday that Russia’s Starlink satellite internet terminals in Ukraine have been “cut off,” disrupting Russian military communications.",
    "fullText": "The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Thursday that Russia’s Starlink satellite internet terminals in Ukraine have been “cut off,” disrupting Russian military communications.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said SpaceX, which owns Starlink, is working with Ukraine to update a “whitelist” of approved and verified Starlink terminals, while unapproved Russian systems have been blocked.\n\n“The Starlink terminals added to the ‘whitelist’ are working. The Russians’ terminals have already been blocked,” Fedorov said in a statement Thursday. “We continue to verify Starlink terminals. The first batch of terminals that made it onto the ‘whitelist’ are already operational.”\n\nA source at the General Staff of the Ukrainian armed forces claimed that “all Russian Starlinks have been cut off” along the front line as of Thursday evening local time.\n\nUnder US sanctions, Starlink cannot be sold to or used by Russia. However, analysts and Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia has increasingly been finding ways to leverage the system to its own advantage. CNN previously reported on Russia’s practice of mounting Starlink systems on its attack drones, which allow the weapons to bypass Ukraine’s electronic defenses that disable drones by jamming GPS and radio signals, and to strike deeper into the country.\n\nUkraine has also relied heavily on Starlink since the beginning the war, using it to operate military communications and drones, as well as information systems for public institutions like hospitals and schools.\n\n“The enemy on the front lines is facing not just a problem, but a catastrophe. All command and control of the troops has collapsed. Assault operations have been halted in many areas,” said Serhii Beskrestnov, an adviser to the defense minister.\n\nElon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, said earlier this week that it was taking steps to stop Russia’s “unauthorized” use of the Starlink satellite internet constellation. Musk reiterated Thursday that it’s “important to register your Starlink terminal if in Ukraine.”\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Defense has not addressed the claims of Starlink disruptions.\n\nBut Russian military bloggers began commenting on the Starlink outages on Wednesday and Thursday, noting that Russia’s internet and communications capabilities on the front line have taken a hit.\n\nOne pro-Kremlin military blogger, Boris Rozhin, wrote a Q&A-style post on Telegram, saying, “Yes, it will have a certain impact on internet availability in the field,” and “yes, there are no alternatives at all, right now.” He also claimed that Russian forces were working to bypass the block and to bring high-speed internet to the field using other methods.\n\nAnother Russian military blog, which supports the airborne special forces, tried to downplay the disruption, writing: “The Starlinks may have been shut down, but the backup communications are still there. The radios are working, and there’s communication between the positions.”\n\nSome Starlink units used by the Ukrainian side were also reportedly cut off, although it’s unclear how widespread the disruption is, as the government continues the whitelisting process.\n\nOne Ukrainian combat officer, Tetiana Chornovol, posted on social media that “the shutdown of Starlink left my two combat positions without communication,” adding that her unit has since brought in an alternative communication system.\n\n“It works for us,” a Ukrainian drone pilot said in a video posted to Telegram. “We immediately registered our Starlink terminal, and everything is fine.”\n\nMeanwhile, the second round of trilateral talks between Ukraine, Russia and the United States concluded in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.\n\nUkrainian presidential chief of staff Kyrylo Budanov, who was part of his country’s delegation, described the negotiations as “truly constructive.”\n\n“I am grateful to the US and the UAE for their high-quality organization and mediation,” Budanov told the Ukrainian news agency RBC-Ukraine.\n\nWhile no breakthrough deal came out of the two days of talks, Russia and Ukraine did agree to conduct their first prisoner exchange since October. Each returned 157 prisoners of war to the other side on Thursday, according to Russian state news agency TASS and US negotiator Steve Witkoff.\n\n“While significant work remains, steps like this demonstrate that sustained diplomatic engagement is delivering tangible results and advancing efforts to end the war in Ukraine,” Witkoff said Thursday in a post on X.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the negotiators agreed to hold another round of talks “in the near future.”\n\nCNN’s Ivana Kottasová, Daria Tarasova-Markina and Sophie Tanno contributed to this report.",

Yet President Donald Trump has been vocal in his criticism of some of U.S. ‌allies and imposed tariffs on them, creating an opening for China.\n\nWhile China's fighter jets and commercial airliners remain far from achieving mass-market international adoption, their makers appeared more assertive and confident and enjoyed greater ‌visibility this year at Asia's largest air show.\n\nThe PLA Air Force's aerobatic team made a headline-grabbing show debut of its Chengdu J-10C fighter jets, an aircraft whose export variant, the J-10CE, surged to prominence in 2025 when customer Pakistan used it to shoot down an Indian Air Force French Rafale.\n\nChinese state media reported the team had used mid-air refuelling to fly directly to Singapore for the high-profile deployment.\n\n\"That's a bit of a message to say: Our power projection is growing,\" said Tim Robinson, editor-in-chief of the Royal ⁠Aeronautical Society's Aerospace magazine.\n\n\"It's one of the key enablers ‌a modern air force should have. Previously people said this is one of their weaknesses.\"\n\nInside the sweltering air show's air-conditioned halls, Chinese state companies occupied a prime spot with brightly lit displays dominated by a 1:2 scale model of AVIC's J-35A stealth multirole ‍fighter. Little is known about the latest addition to Chinese air power, which was first seen domestically in 2024.\n\nNo technical data was displayed, but observers of the global arms marketplace said the message to Asia's buyers was evident.\n\n\"That's obviously positioned to say: if you can't afford an F-35 or are banned from buying an F-35 we've got an alternative,\" Robinson said.\n\nSoutheast Asian defence officials crowded Chinese military and aerospace booths, underscoring Beijing’s growing pull as it aggressively markets hardware across the region.\n\nThe show of strength ‌landed at a politically sensitive moment, with Southeast Asian governments increasingly uneasy about U.S. security commitments amid a more isolationist Washington under Trump, analysts and Western officials said.\n\n\"We see the same delegations as before but the conversation has changed,\" said a senior official at a Western arms company.\n\nIndustry-watchers are cautious about any sudden switch of arms trade but agree the backdrop reflects the new power politics and the diversification of supply chains.\n\n\"The Chinese arms companies may think that, if other countries have lost confidence in buying American, there's an opportunity for China,\" said China defence specialist Bradley Perrett.\n\n\"But most of the U.S.' customers, if they want to look elsewhere, will look ⁠at European, South Korean and Japanese equipment.\"\n\nAsia's arms spending is growing apace as countries respond ​to a sustained build-up from an increasingly assertive China.\n\nChina's efforts to penetrate the airliner ​market, grabbing share from Airbus and Boeing, are proceeding slowly due in part to the lengthy process of winning European certification.\n\nBut state-owned planemaker COMAC again flew the C919 narrowbody jet and advertised the future C929 wide-body in model form at the show. That is now ‍progressing through detailed design as a Chinese ⁠project after initially exploring a joint development with Russia.\n\nChinese delegates said that given the Singapore venue, COMAC was prioritising potential clients from Southeast Asia, and Indonesian attendees were among those inquiring about aircraft.\n\nChina's efforts to rival Airbus and Boeing are a national priority though Western analysts say it will take ⁠years if not decades to establish the global footprint and marketing support that helps the industry leaders maintain entrenched positions.\n\nBut delegates noted a broadening commercial assault at the show including the market ‌for alternative third-party spare parts, tapping into airline concerns about shortages at a time when supplies are strained across the globe.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The U.S. and Russia agreed Thursday to reestablish high-level military dialogue for the first time in more than four years in another sign of warming relations between the two countries since President Donald Trump returned to office and sought to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nHigh-level military communication was suspended in late 2021, as tension between Moscow and Washington rose ahead of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Trump then campaigned for a second term on promises that he would swiftly end the fighting. Many of his proposals for peace have heavily favored the Kremlin, including requiring Ukraine to cede territory to Russia.\n\nThe restored communication channel “will provide a consistent military-to-military contact as the parties continue to work towards a lasting peace,” the U.S. European Command said in a statement. The agreement emerged from a meeting between senior Russian and American military officials in the capital of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nU.S. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, who is the commander in Europe of both U.S. and NATO forces, was in Abu Dhabi, where talks between American, Russian and Ukrainian officials on ending the war entered a second day.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow escalated its attacks on Ukraine’s power grid in an apparent effort to deny civilians power and to weaken public support for the fight, while hostilities continued along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line snaking through eastern and southern parts of Ukraine.\n\nThe resumption of the military hotline marks an effort to ease tensions that soared after the start of the war and to avoid collisions between Russian and U.S. forces.\n\nIn one such incident in March 2023, the American military said it ditched an Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone in the Black Sea after a pair of Russian fighter jets dumped fuel on it, and then one of them struck its propeller while flying in international airspace.\n\nMoscow has denied that its warplanes hit the drone, alleging that it crashed while making a sharp maneuver. The Kremlin said its aircraft reacted to a violation of a no-fly zone Russia has established in the area near Crimea.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly voiced concern about intelligence flights by the U.S. and other NATO aircraft over the Black Sea, and some Russian officials charged that the American surveillance flights helped gather intelligence that allowed Ukraine to strike Russian targets.\n\nNATO members have been increasingly worried about intrusions into allied airspace. Some European officials described the incidents as Moscow testing NATO’s response.\n\nIn September, a swarm of Russian drones flew into Poland’s airspace, prompting NATO aircraft to scramble to intercept them and shoot down some of the devices. It was the first direct encounter between NATO and Moscow since the full-scale invasion. Later that month, NATO jets escorted three Russian warplanes out of Estonia’s airspace.\n\nRussia, Ukraine exchange prisoners following talks\n\nThe delegations from Moscow and Kyiv were joined Thursday in Abu Dhabi by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, according to Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council chief, who was present at the meeting.\n\nThey were also at last month's talks in the same place as the Trump administration tries to steer Russia and Ukraine toward a settlement.\n\nOfficials have provided no information about any progress in the discussions.\n\nFollowing the talks on Thursday, however, Russia and Ukraine said they carried out a prisoner exchange.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said it brought 157 Russian servicemen back from Ukrainian captivity, as well as three Russian nationals captured during Kyiv's incursion into Russia's Kursk region. Ukrainian officials said 150 Ukrainian servicemen and seven civilians returned from Russian captivity.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said the released Russian soldiers are currently in Belarus, getting medical assistance, before being taken back to Russia “for treatment and rehabilitation.”\n\nUkrainian human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said that among the 150 service members who returned from Russian captivity, 18 were \"illegally sentenced by Russia.” He said that “overall, those released are in a difficult psychological condition, and some are critically underweight.”\n\nZelenskyy says 55,000 Ukrainian troops killed in the war\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 55,000 Ukrainian troops have died since Russia’s invasion. “And there is a large number of people whom Ukraine considers missing,” he added in an interview broadcast late Wednesday by French TV channel France 2.\n\nThe last time Zelenskyy gave a figure for battlefield deaths, in early 2025, he said 46,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed.\n\nZelenskyy has repeatedly said his country needs security guarantees from the U.S. and Europe to deter any postwar Russian attacks.\n\nUkrainians must feel that there is genuine progress toward peace and “not toward a scenario in which the Russians exploit everything to their advantage and continue their strikes,” Zelenskyy said on social media late Wednesday.\n\nLast year saw a 31% increase in Ukrainian civilian casualties compared with 2024, the advocacy group Human Rights Watch said in a report published Wednesday.\n\nAlmost 15,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and just over 40,000 wounded since the start of the war through last December, according to the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine.\n\nRussian troops have lost access to their Starlink satellite internet terminals on the front line, Ukrainian Economic Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said Thursday, after Ukraine asked Elon Musk’s SpaceX to help deny Russia use of the service in Ukraine.\n\nRussian forces have consequently lost command-and-control capabilities and navigation for drones, and assaults have stopped in many sectors, according to Fedorov’s adviser Serhii Beskrestnov. Russian officials made no immediate comment.\n\nUkraine is registering its civilian and military Starlink users on a database, allowing approved devices to function while unregistered terminals are disabled inside Ukraine.\n\nAlso, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said during a visit to Kyiv that he agreed with Zelenskyy to develop the joint production of ammunition at plants in their countries.\n\nZelenskyy said Poland plans to increase supplies to Ukraine of liquefied natural gas, and the countries are exploring an exchange of weaponry, with Kyiv possibly receiving Polish MiG fighter jets and Warsaw receiving Ukrainian drones.\n\nRussia fired 183 drones and two ballistic missiles at Ukraine overnight, according to the Ukrainian air force. Three people were injured, officials said.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said its air defenses downed 95 Ukrainian drones overnight over several regions, the Azov Sea and Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014.\n\nThis story corrects an earlier version that said Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2016. The annexation happened in 2014.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "An active-duty enlisted member of the US military said their unit was \"pressured\" into seeing Amazon's \"Melania\" documentary about the first lady.",
    "fullText": "It was the story of the weekend: \"Melania,\" Amazon's documentary on first lady Melania Trump, beat expectations at the box office, becoming one of the best-performing documentaries in recent years with an opening weekend gross of $7 million across 1,778 screens. (Whether it makes back its $75 million investment is another story.)\n\nDespite dismal critic reviews, the numbers suggest audiences turned out for \"Melania\" to support the first lady. One advocacy group suggests the reality may be more complicated.\n\nMikey Weinstein, the president and founder of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, said the nonprofit received reports from eight bases around the world that U.S. military members were being \"pressured\" to see \"Melania.\"\n\n\"People are scared,\" said Weinstein, a former Air Force officer and attorney who said his group is made up of nearly 100,000 current and former members of the U.S. military and represents those who feel pressured or coerced into unconstitutional religious observances. \"They were pressured to see the movie.\"\n\n\"Your military superior, that's not your shift manager at Taco Bell or Starbucks. They have complete and total control over you.\"\n\nIn an email Weinstein shared with Business Insider, an active-duty enlisted member of the US military said they were writing on behalf of a dozen of their unit members and their families who felt \"pressured\" by their unit commander to see the movie. The MRFF did not disclose the name of the person who sent the email.\n\nIn the email, this person said their commander suggested the unit and their family members join him, his wife, and their children at a showing of \"Melania\" at an off-base movie theater.\n\nThe screening was designated as one of the commander's \"Unit Activity Events,\" morale-boosting activities that can range from flag football and barbecues to movie nights, the email said. The military member who sent the email said the unit is required to attend at least three of the four UAEs that are scheduled each month or face a penalty.\n\nAsked if any of the MRFF members who contacted him skipped the movie, Weinstein said: \"Every one of our clients who came to us either went to see it or suddenly got sick.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment, a Department of Defense official told Business Insider, \"There is no Department of War directive requiring service members to see this film, though the film is fantastic.\"",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan is refusing to voluntarily comply with a Justice Department investigation into a video she organized urging U.S. military members to resist “illegal orders” — escalating a dispute that President Donald Trump has publicly pushed.\n\nIn letters first obtained by The Associated Press, Slotkin’s lawyer informed U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro that the senator would not agree to a voluntary interview about the video. Slotkin's legal team also requested that Pirro preserve all documents related to the matter for “anticipated litigation.”\n\nSlotkin’s lawyer separately wrote to Attorney General Pam Bondi, declining to sit for an FBI interview about the video and urging her to immediately terminate any inquiry.\n\nThe refusal marks a potential turning point in the standoff, shifting the burden onto the Justice Department to decide whether it will escalate an investigation into sitting members of Congress or retreat from an inquiry now being openly challenged.\n\n“I did this to go on offense,” Slotkin said in an interview Wednesday. “And to put them in a position where they’re tap dancing. To put them in a position where they have to own their choices of using a U.S. attorney’s office to come after a senator.”\n\n‘It’s not gonna stop unless I fight back'\n\nLast November, Slotkin joined five other Democratic lawmakers — all of whom previously served in the military or at intelligence agencies — in posting a 90-second video urging U.S. service members to follow established military protocols and reject orders they believe to be unlawful.\n\nThe lawmakers said Trump's Republican administration was “pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens” and called on troops to “stand up for our laws.”\n\nThe video sparked a firestorm in Republican circles and soon drew the attention of Trump, who accused the lawmakers of sedition and said their actions were “punishable by death.”\n\nThe Pentagon later announced it had opened an investigation into Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, a former Navy pilot who appeared in the video. The FBI then contacted the lawmakers seeking interviews, signaling a broader Justice Department inquiry.\n\nSlotkin said multiple legal advisers initially urged caution.\n\n“Maybe if you keep quiet, this will all go away over Christmas,” Slotkin said she was told.\n\nBut in January, the matter flared again, with the lawmakers saying they were contacted by the U.S. attorney’s office for the District of Columbia.\n\nMeanwhile, security threats mounted. Slotkin said her farm in Michigan received a bomb threat, her brother was assigned a police detail due to threats and her parents were swatted in the middle of the night.\n\nHer father, who died in January after a long battle with cancer, “could barely walk and he’s dealing with the cops in his home,” she said.\n\nSlotkin said a “switch went off” in her and she became angry: “And I said, ‘It’s not gonna stop unless I fight back.’”\n\nDemocratic senators draw a line\n\nThe requests from the FBI and the Justice Department have been voluntary. Slotkin said that her legal team had communicated with prosecutors but that officials “keep asking for a personal interview.”\n\nSlotkin’s lawyer, Preet Bharara, in the letter to Pirro declined the interview request and asked that she “immediately terminate any open investigation and cease any further inquiry concerning the video.” In the other letter, Bharara urged Bondi to use her authority to direct Pirro to close the inquiry.\n\nBharara wrote that Slotkin’s constitutional rights had been infringed and said litigation is being considered.\n\n“All options are most definitely on the table,” Slotkin said. Asked whether she would comply with a subpoena, she paused before responding: “I’d take a hard look at it.”\n\nBharara, who's representing Slotkin in the case, is a former U.S. attorney in New York who was fired by Trump in 2017 during his first administration. He's also representing Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California in a separate case involving the Justice Department.\n\nKelly has similarly pushed back, suing the Pentagon last month over attempts to punish him for the video. On Tuesday, a federal judge said that he knows of no U.S. Supreme Court precedent to justify the Pentagon’s censuring of Kelly as he weighed whether to intervene.\n\nSlotkin said she's in contact with the other lawmakers who appeared in the video, but she wouldn't say what their plans were in the investigations.\n\nTrump has frequently and consistently targeted his political opponents. In some cases, those attacks have had the unintended consequence of elevating their national standing.\n\nIn Kelly’s case, he raised more than $12.5 million in the final months of 2025 following the “illegal orders” video controversy, according to campaign finance filings.\n\nSlotkin, like Kelly, has been mentioned among Democrats who could emerge as presidential contenders in 2028.\n\nShe previously represented one of the nation’s most competitive House districts before winning a Senate seat in Michigan in 2024, even as Trump carried the state.\n\nSlotkin delivered the Democratic response to Trump’s address to Congress last year and has since urged her party to confront him more aggressively, saying Democrats had lost their “alpha energy” and calling on them to “go nuclear” against Trump’s redistricting push.\n\n“If I’m encouraging other people to take risk, how can I not then accept risk myself?\" Slotkin said. “I think you’ve got to show people that we’re not going to lay down and take it.”",

    "fullText": "Feb 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. military on Tuesday shot down an Iranian drone that \"aggressively\" approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, ​the U.S. military said, in an incident first reported by Reuters.\n\nThe incident came as diplomats sought ‌to arrange nuclear talks between Iran and the United States, and U.S. President Donald Trump warned that with U.S. warships heading ‌toward Iran, \"bad things\" would probably happen if a deal could not be reached.\n\nOil futures prices rose more than $1 per barrel after news the drone was shot down.\n\nThe Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier \"with unclear intent\" and was shot down by an F-35 U.S. fighter jet, the U.S. military said.\n\n\"An F-35C fighter jet from ⁠Abraham Lincoln shot down the Iranian ‌drone in self-defense and to protect the aircraft carrier and personnel on board,\" said Navy Captain Tim Hawkins, a spokesperson at the U.S. military's Central Command.\n\nIran's U.N. ‍mission declined to comment.\n\nIran's Tasnim news agency said connection had been lost with a drone in international waters, but the reason was unknown.\n\nNo American service members were harmed during the incident and no U.S. equipment was damaged, he added.\n\nThe Lincoln ​carrier strike group is the most visible part of a U.S. military buildup in the Middle East ‌following a violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month, the deadliest domestic unrest in Iran since its 1979 revolution.\n\nTrump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene during the crackdown, has since demanded Tehran make nuclear concessions and sent a flotilla to its coast. He said last week Iran was \"seriously talking,\" while Tehran's top security official, Ali Larijani, said arrangements for negotiations were under way.\n\nIRANIAN BOATS HARASS U.S.-FLAGGED TANKER\n\nIn ⁠a separate incident on Tuesday in the Strait of ​Hormuz, just hours after the drone shootdown, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard ​Corps forces harassed a U.S.-flagged, U.S.-crewed merchant vessel, according to the U.S. military.\n\n\"Two IRGC boats and an Iranian Mohajer drone approached M/V Stena Imperative at high speeds and ‍threatened to board and seize ⁠the tanker,\" Hawkins said.\n\nMaritime risk management group Vanguard said the Iranian boats ordered the tanker to stop its engine and prepare to be boarded. Instead, the tanker sped up and continued its ⁠voyage.\n\nHawkins said a U.S. Navy warship, the McFaul, was operating in the area and escorted the Stena Imperative.\n\n\"The situation de-escalated as ‌a result, and the U.S.-flagged tanker is proceeding safely,\" Hawkins added.",

    "fullText": "Frozen weapons are among the many challenges NATO soldiers would face in an Arctic conflict.\n\nSoldiers have to be careful not to let the harsh elements cause their guns to malfunction.\n\nBut they also can't let the guns get too warm, as that creates new problems.\n\nSODANKYLÄ, Finland — Among the many challenges NATO soldiers face in the harsh Arctic environment, the possibility of frozen weapons is one that risks leaving them most vulnerable.\n\nIt's anything but easy to keep guns, drones, and other equipment in the right conditions far above the Arctic Circle, where temperatures routinely drop below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, and the heavy snow brings unwanted moisture that can cause jamming and other problems.\n\nNATO military personnel training in northern Finland told Business Insider during a visit to the region in late January that they can't afford to let their guns get too warm if they want them to work in this climate.\n\nThe biggest problem with weapons in these conditions is temperature variation, said Maj. Mikael Aikio, the Arctic section leader of the Finnish Army's Jaeger Brigade, which is leading a winter warfare training and cold-weather survival course for roughly 20 NATO soldiers.\n\nThe monthlong course, hosted in Finland's northern Lapland region, teaches NATO soldiers how to live, move, and fight in the harsh Arctic environment.\n\nThis type of training has become a growing priority for NATO as officials call for greater Arctic defense amid increasing Russian and Chinese activity in the High North. Western forces could find themselves fighting on frozen battlefields as the alliance and its adversaries compete for influence in this strategic region.\n\nLapland, like other northern regions in NATO's seven Arctic states, is a tough place to operate in winter. The biting cold, limited sunlight, and deep snowfall force troops to move slowly and with caution. And limited support infrastructure makes sustainment even more difficult up north.\n\nIn the Arctic, survival is only the first challenge. Troops must also keep their weapons functioning; even minor equipment failures can hand the enemy an edge.\n\nCanadian Cpt. Vincent Lemelin, one of the participants in the Arctic warfare training course, said all technology struggles in this part of the world, especially anything that requires charging, such as drones.\n\nAnything that gets covered in snow eventually becomes damp or wet, Lemelin said, so soldiers try to keep their guns cold at all times to avoid having ice or snow melt and introduce any moisture that might freeze and prevent it from working properly.\n\nFinnish Lt. Laura Lähdekorpi, another course participant, said she carries a brush with her at all times to clear snow from her gun, especially from sensitive areas like the optics, which are more vulnerable to buildup. Soldiers are trained to ensure their weapons are dry to prevent anything from freezing up.\n\nLähdekorpi said firing a cold gun is a challenge. Her outer gloves are too bulky, so she strips them off and uses a thin liner to pull the trigger, but that leaves her hands exposed to the weapon's metal frame, which holds the cold.\n\n\"I think my hands are the worst enemy for me,\" she said. \"I have to keep them warm.\"\n\nProper weapon care doesn't end when training stops. Soldiers are taught to keep their guns at a steady ambient temperature. Bringing them into a warm tent, for instance, can cause condensation that later refreezes.\n\nSoldiers can't leave the guns outside their tents, as they might be stolen in real-world conditions. Instead, they bring them inside but place the weapons on the ground or in a space that is almost as cold as it is outside.\n\nProper firearm temperature management is not the only equipment struggle in the harsh Arctic. Drones are also relatively limited in their capabilities, especially in extreme cold, when temperatures drop below -14 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nDuring a combat exercise in the middle of the Arctic warfare course, soldiers practiced using drones to collect targeting data and call in artillery strikes against a simulated enemy force made up of Finnish conscripts.\n\nUsing small drones for reconnaissance, targeting, and fire support missions is standard practice in the Russian war against Ukraine, and they are expected to continue to be a key part of the kill chain in future conflicts, despite their limitations.\n\nAikio, a Jaeger Brigade major, said drones need special handling in Arctic conditions. Leaving them exposed on snowmobiles before launch risks damage from the elements, and once airborne, icing on small propellers and limited visibility can quickly degrade performance.\n\nLearning to keep weapons and other gear operational in this environment is one of many skills NATO soldiers are being taught to master in Finland, roughly a third of which lies above the Arctic Circle.

    "description": "The anti-corruption campaign has left open positions and a lack of senior officials with the experience to fill them.",
    "fullText": "China's drive to modernize its military to rival the US armed forces is running parallel with an aggressive purge of its senior leaders.\n\nThe People's Liberation Army has been repeatedly shaken by a massive anti-corruption campaign led by Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Now, the military leadership is under renewed scrutiny after one of China's most senior generals was placed under investigation.\n\nThe latest disruptions within the PLA, the world's largest military and one of its most powerful, raise questions about who is leading the force and how the shake-ups are affecting the military as an organization and impacting readiness.\n\nThis past weekend, China's defense ministry announced investigations into Gen. Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Liu Zhenli, the chief of staff of the commission's joint staff department. Zhang was widely believed to be one of Xi's trusted military advisors.\n\nAn editorial published in official PLA media said the two had \"seriously betrayed the trust and expectations\" of both the Communist Party and the CMC and \"fostered political and corruption problems that undermined the party's absolute leadership over the military and threatened the party's ruling foundation.\"\n\nAnalysts Business Insider spoke with said the accusations suggested more than just financial corruption, which has been the case for others. Rather, the language indicates Zhang and Liu challenged Xi's authority, whether through disagreements on modernization goals, failures to meet expectations, or power and influence struggles within the ranks. The reasons may never be known, as China's \"black box\" opacity increasingly blurs realities inside its government.\n\nA report from the Wall Street Journal raised the possibility Zhang leaked nuclear weapons data to the US. Business Inside is unable to independently verify the information.\n\nOf the seven officials appointed to the Central Military Commission in 2022, only two — Xi himself and Zhang Shengmin, the commission's anti-graft officer — remain in power. The rest are either under investigation or have been expelled.\n\nTwo defense ministers have been ousted, and last October, nine top PLA commanders were purged. The exact number of senior military leaders affected is unknown, but there are indications the purge has deeply impacted the senior officer corps.\n\nZhang is the highest-ranking official affected by Xi's crackdown on the military. And across the lower ranks of the PLA, dozens of other officers have been removed from their positions.\n\n\"This is kind of the ultimate crescendo of this anti-corruption campaign in the military,\" Jonathan Czin, an expert at the Brookings Institute who previously served as a top China analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency and director for China at the United States National Security Council, told Business Insider.\n\n\"It sends a very clear sign throughout the system that nobody is safe regardless of what kind of relationship you had or have with Xi Jinping,\" he said.\n\nMore investigations may follow those of Zhang and Liu. Officials with ties to the two men could come under suspicion as well, analysts said. Other senior people have been notably absent from important meetings in recent months, suggesting more shakeups.\n\nThat leaves Xi with a difficult next step: deciding who can credibly fill the vacancies.\n\nBecause so many senior officers have been removed or face investigations, \"the pool of candidates for refilling top positions has been winnowed,\" Brian Hart, the deputy director and fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies' China Power Project, told Business Insider. \"Xi could continue to use the existing command structure of the CMC and fill it with new people loyal to him,\" he added. \"It is also possible Xi could try to start over with a bit of a blank slate by more fundamentally remaking the PLA's leadership structure.\"\n\nFewer experienced commanders could slow coordination across China's military — a serious challenge for complex operations like a blockade or invasion of Taiwan.\n\nSome PLA watchers argue Xi appears willing to accept those short-term costs if the result is a force that is more politically loyal and disciplined over time. The PLA Daily editorial framed the campaign as a net positive, arguing that \"the more the People's Army fights corruption, the stronger, purer, and more combat-capable it becomes.\"\n\nA senior Pentagon official previously speculated that the extensive corruption in China's military was hindering its modernization.\n\nAmid disruptions in the force, China may seek to send a signal that shake-ups aren't affecting military readiness.\n\n\"You could actually see an uptick in the number of major exercises around Taiwan, but internally it could mask significant upheaval and disarray within the PLA,\" Lyle Morris, a senior fellow for foreign policy and national security at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis, told Business Insider.\n\nChina staged large joint exercises around Taiwan following earlier purge waves. Such actions could project readiness despite leadership turmoil.\n\nThe internal upheaval is likely having an effect, though, China watchers said. \"It is hard to deny that this creates challenges for the PLA in the short term,\" Hart said. \"Any leader deciding on using force would want senior leaders and commanders in place who are loyal, experienced, and effective in their roles. The immense turnover within the PLA's highest ranks complicates that.\"",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Marco Rubio gave a full-throated defense Wednesday of President Donald Trump's military operation to oust and arrest then-Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, while also using his wide-ranging congressional testimony to touch on Greenland, NATO, Iran and China.\n\nAs Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee offered starkly different readings of the administration's foreign policy, Rubio addressed Trump's intentions and his often bellicose rhetoric that have alarmed U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere.\n\nIn the first public hearing since the Jan. 3 intervention to depose Maduro, Rubio said Trump had acted to take out a major U.S. national security threat in the Western Hemisphere. Trump's top diplomat said America was safer and more secure as a result and that the Republican administration would work with interim authorities to stabilize the South American country.\n\n“We’re not going to have this thing turn around overnight, but I think we’re making good and decent progress,” Rubio said. “We are certainly better off today in Venezuela than we were four weeks ago and I think and hope and expect that we’ll be better off in three months and six months and nine months than we would have been had Maduro still been there.\"\n\nThe former Florida senator said that Venezuela's current leaders are cooperating and would soon begin to see benefits. But he backed away from remarks prepared for the hearing that Washington would not hesitate to take further military action should those leaders not fully accept Trump's demands.\n\n“I can tell you right now with full certainty, we are not postured to nor do we intend or expect to have to take any military action in Venezuela at any time,\" Rubio said. “I think it would require the emergence of an imminent threat of the kind that we do not anticipate at this time.”\n\nHe said Venezuela soon will be allowed to sell oil that is now subject to U.S. sanctions. The revenue would be set aside to pay for basic government services such as policing and health care. Oil sale money will be deposited in a U.S. Treasury-controlled account and released after the U.S. approves monthly budgets to be submitted by Venezuela, he said.\n\nPushback against skepticism from Democrats\n\nRepublican senators, with few exceptions, praised the Venezuelan operation. Among Democrats, there was deep skepticism.\n\nThey questioned Trump's policies in Venezuela and their potential for encouraging moves by China against Taiwan and Russia even more so in Ukraine, as well as his threats to take Greenland from NATO ally Denmark and his insults about the alliance's contributions to U.S. security.\n\nHe said the uproar over Greenland within NATO is calming and that talks are underway about how to deal with Trump's demands. The Republican president insists the U.S. needs Greenland to counter threats from Russia and China, but he recently backed away from a pledge to impose tariffs on several European countries that sent troops to the semiautonomous Danish territory in a show of solidarity.\n\n“I think we’re going to get something positive done,\" Rubio said.\n\nRubio dismissed criticism that Trump was undermining the alliance, while repeating the long-running American complaint that member nations need to boost their defense budgets.\n\n“NATO needs to be reimagined.” Rubio said. “I just think this president complains about it louder than other presidents.\"\n\nHe said China's stated goal to reunify Taiwan with the mainland would not be affected by any other world event, including the Maduro operation.\n\n“The situation on Taiwan is a legacy project\" that Chinese President Xi Jinping has made \"very clear that that’s what he intends to do and that’s going to be irrespective anything that happens in the world,” Rubio said.\n\nAs Trump once more threatens Iran with military action, Rubio said there was no current plan to attack. Asked about the potential for a change of government in Tehran, Rubio said that would require “a lot of careful thinking” because it would be “far more complex” than ousting Maduro.\n\nMore details about the raid in Caracas\n\nThe committee chairman, Idaho Sen. Jim Risch, praised Trump’s decisions to remove Maduro, continue deadly military strikes on boats suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean and seize sanctioned tankers.\n\nRisch also offered new details on the operation in the Venezuelan capital, saying it involved “only about 200 troops” and a “firefight that lasted less than 27 minutes.”\n\n“This military action was incredibly brief, targeted and successful,” Risch said, adding that the U.S. and other nations may have to assist Venezuela when it seeks to restore democratic elections. ”Venezuela may require U.S. and international oversight to ensure these elections are indeed free and fair,” he said.\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the committee's top Democrat, questioned whether that operation was worth it, considering most of Maduro's top aides and lieutenants still run the Venezuela and the economic situation there remains bleak.\n\n\"We’ve traded one dictator for another, so it’s no wonder that so many of my constituents are asking, why is the president spending so much time focused on Venezuela instead of the cost of living and their kitchen table economic concerns?\" she asked. “From Venezuela to Europe, the United States is spending more, risking more and achieving less.”\n\nCongress hasn't curtailed Trump on Venezuela\n\nCongressional Democrats have condemned Trump’s moves as exceeding the authority of the executive branch, while most Republicans have supported them as a legitimate exercise of presidential power.\n\nThe GOP-led House narrowly defeated a war powers act resolution that would have directed Trump to remove U.S. troops from Venezuela. As Rubio argued, the administration says there are no U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela despite a large military buildup in the region.\n\nDemocrats contended the resolution was necessary after the U.S. raid to capture Maduro and because Trump has stated plans to control the country’s oil industry for years to come.\n\nFamilies of two Trinidadian nationals killed in an administration boat strike filed what is thought to be the first wrongful-death case arising from that campaign. Three dozen strikes on boats in the region have killed at least 126 people since September.\n\nUS acts to normalize ties while issuing warnings\n\nWhile keeping pressure on those the U.S. calls “narcotraffickers” without providing evidence, officials also are working to normalize ties with Venezuela's acting president, Delcy Rodríguez.\n\nThe administration has said its demands for Rodriguez include opening Venezuela’s energy sector to U.S. companies, providing preferential access to production, using oil revenue to purchase American goods, and ending subsidized oil exports to Cuba.\n\nRodríguez, who was Maduro's vice president, said Tuesday that her government and the U.S. “have established respectful and courteous channels of communication.” And so far, she has appeared to acquiesce to Trump’s demands and to release prisoners jailed by the government under Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez.\n\nIn a key step to the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the State Department notified Congress this week that it intends to begin sending additional diplomatic and support personnel to Caracas to prepare for the possible reopening of the U.S. Embassy, which shuttered in 2019. Fully normalizing ties, however, would require the U.S. to revoke its decision recognizing the Venezuelan parliament elected in 2015 as the country’s legitimate government.\n\nLater Wednesday, Rubio was to meet Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado at the State Department.",

    "description": "In a major shift for Ukraine's military, Serhii \"Flash\" Beskrestnov and Serhii Sternenko are now officially advising Kyiv on defense tech and drones.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's new defense minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, has appointed two prominent Telegram bloggers and activists to his \"team of new leaders,\" saying they will advise him on defense technology and drone warfare.\n\nThe move is a major recognition for the pair — Serhii \"Flash\" Beskrestnov and Serhii Sternenko — who are among the most influential voices among the volunteers filling vital gaps in logistics and drone expertise for Ukraine's battered military.\n\nBeskrestnov, widely cited among Ukrainians as an expert on drones, runs a Telegram channel with some 156,000 followers, where he publicly analyzes Russian and Ukrainian battle drones and how they've performed.\n\nFedorov named him an advisor in defense technology on Sunday, saying Beskrestnov would focus on helping Ukraine build counter-systems for Russian strike and reconnaissance drones.\n\nIn his statement, Fedorov said that Beskrestnov would also support Ukraine's military in analyzing Russian tech, studying \"logistics, study of enemy solutions, and leveraging this experience to our advantage.\"\n\nSternenko, a political activist who now runs an organization that raises funds for military drones, was appointed as Fedorov's advisor on Thursday.\n\n\"From now on, Serhii will act as my advisor on enhancing the use of UAVs at the frontline. His experience will help us implement our shared vision of improving the effectiveness of units operating unmanned systems,\" Fedorov said.\n\nThe Sternenko Foundation serves as a hub for drone procurement, raising money to buy specialized first-person-view drones for military units that demonstrate they're combat-effective.\n\nAs of Monday, it says it has delivered over 256,000 drones on demand to Ukrainian units.\n\nFedorov, Ukraine's youngest-ever defense minister at 35, previously was the country's minister for digital transformation. Since being confirmed to his new role earlier this month, he's pledged to revitalize Ukraine's military, promising to reform its training programs, internal culture, and organizational doctrine.\n\nAppointing Sternenko and Beskrestnov as advisors is a significant change in how Kyiv treats its grassroots movements. These groups work closely with Ukrainian forces, but top authorities have generally been slow to officially recognize or integrate them.\n\nSeveral frontline units previously told Business Insider that they sometimes rely on the Sternenko Foundation, for example, for drones that can effectively cope with Russian electronic warfare. While the Ukrainian military provides its fighters with drones in bulk, these sometimes need further tweaks as the battlefield evolves rapidly.\n\nVolunteer foundations often step in and have become known for their speed, leveraging connections with drone manufacturers and informal logistics networks to deliver priority supplies, vehicles, and modified drones within hours or days.\n\nFedorov said that Sternenko would particularly assist in establishing basic support for drone units, adding that 50 of Ukraine's 400 units account for 70% of its battlefield engagements.\n\n\"The objective is to enable the other 350 units to grow quickly and significantly increase the scale of destroying Russian forces,\" Fedorov said.\n\nBeskrestnov, meanwhile, regularly publicizes news about Russia's Shahed-type drones. He often posts footage from found wreckage to show how the Kremlin has been modifying or upgrading the loitering munitions.\n\nFedorov's team credited the drone analyst for being the \"first to report on the use by Russians of FPV drones equipped with machine vision, as well as the use of jet-powered Shahed drones.\"\n\nThe new defense minister's attempt to reshape Ukraine's military comes as it grapples with a slew of challenges, including heightened fighting intensity on the front lines in recent months and a withdrawal of most US miliary support.\n\nIn his opening speech to Ukraine's parliament, Fedorov said the country was facing a high rate of desertion and draft dodging, and that the military's budget had shrunk since last year.",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Two Iranian-backed militias in the Mideast are signaling their willingness to launch new attacks, likely trying to back Iran, as officials acknowledged the arrival of a U.S. aircraft carrier to the region Monday. President Donald Trump ordered the carriers to move to the Middle East as he threatened military action over its crackdown on nationwide protests.\n\nYemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels on Monday hinted they were ready to resume attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. That came just after Iraq's Kataib Hezbollah paramilitary group, long supported by Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, issued a direct threat late Sunday toward any attack targeting Iran, warning a “total war” in the region would be a result.\n\nThe statements came as the entire region is mired in a tense waiting game to see if Trump will strike. Both the Houthis and Kataib Hezbollah sat out from Israel's 12-day war on Iran in June that saw the United States bomb Iranian nuclear sites. The hesitancy to get involved shows the disarray still affecting Iran's self-described “Axis of Resistance” after facing attacks from Israel during its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe threats came as the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and other guided missile destroyers in its strike group arrived in the region to “promote regional security and stability,” U.S. Central Command said Monday on social media.\n\nTrump has said the ships are being moved “just in case” he decides to take action against Iran. He has already laid out two red lines for attack — the killing of peaceful protesters and Tehran conducting mass executions of those it has arrested in a massive crackdown over the demonstrations.\n\nA senior Iranian military official who spoke anonymously on Iran's State TV dismissed the American threat as “an exaggeration” and noted that Iran had increased its military presence in response. The official added that the Lincoln's presence was not a deterrent but an accessible target.\n\nThreats from Iraq, Yemen, while Hezbollah stays mum\n\nIran projected its power across the Mideast through the “Axis of Resistance,” a network of proxy militant groups in Gaza, Lebanon, Yemen, Syria, and Iraq, and other places. It was also seen as a defensive buffer, intended to keep conflict away from Iranian borders. But it has collapsed after Israel targeted Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon and others during the Gaza war. Meanwhile, rebels in 2024 overthrew Syria’s Bashar Assad after a yearslong, bloody war in which Iran backed his rule.\n\nThe Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, one of Iran's staunchest allies, refused to say how it planned to react in the case of a possible attack.\n\n“During the past two months, several parties have asked me a clear and frank question: If Israel and America go to war against Iran, will Hezbollah intervene or not?” Hezbollah leader Sheikh Naim Kassem said via a video address to thousands of supporters gathered in Beirut's southern suburbs for a rally backing Iran.\n\nHe said the group is preparing for “possible aggression and is determined to defend” against it. But as to how it would act, he said, “these details will be determined by the battle and we will determine them according to the interests that are present.”\n\nIraqi and Yemenite militant groups were much more forthright in their threats, which were interpreted as support for Iran. A short video by the Houthis included images of a ship on fire, with the caption: “Soon.” It later aired footage Monday from its January 2024 attack in the Gulf of Aden on the Marshall Islands-flagged tanker Marlin Luanda, one of over 100 ships attacked as part of a campaign the Houthis said pressured Israel over its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe Houthis halted their fire after a ceasefire in Gaza, though they've repeatedly warned they could resume fire if needed.\n\nMeanwhile, Ahmad “Abu Hussein” al-Hamidawi of Kataib Hezbollah issued his own threat in a statement.\n\n“We affirm to the enemies that the war on the (Islamic) Republic will not be a picnic; rather, you will taste the bitterest forms of death, and nothing will remain of you in our region,” he said.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates announced on Monday that it would not allow its airspace, territory or territorial waters to be used for military action against Iran. The UAE said it would stress dialogue and diplomatic resolutions.\n\nIran warns America not to attack\n\nIranian Defense Ministry spokesperson Gen. Reza Talaei-Nik renewed warnings Monday to both Israel and the U.S., saying any attack would “be met with a response that is more painful and more decisive than in the past.” Iranian state television quoted Talaei-Nik as saying that threats required Iran “to maintain full and comprehensive preparedness.”\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei separately told journalists: “Regional countries fully know that any security breach in the region will not affect Iran only. The lack of security is contagious.”\n\nIran over the weekend unveiled a new banner in Tehran's Enghelab Square threatening the Lincoln, showing an aircraft carrier strewn with bodies and streaked with blood with the warning: “If you sow the wind, you will reap the whirlwind.” However, Iran is still reeling from the 12-day war in June in which its air defense systems were broadly destroyed, top military leaders killed, and its nuclear enrichment sites bombed by the U.S.\n\nAs a sign of concern over its airspace, Iran issued a notice to pilots Sunday that banned small private aircraft from flying in the country, with carve-outs for the oil industry and emergency medical flights.\n\nMany Western airlines have started to avoid Iranian airspace entirely due to the tensions, though Gulf Arab carriers flying to Moscow still rely on the route. Iranian air defense troops in 2020 shot down a Ukrainian commercial airliner, killing 176 people on board.\n\nDeath toll rises from protest crackdown\n\nThe protests in Iran began on Dec. 28, sparked by the fall of the Iranian currency, the rial, and quickly spread across the country. They were met by a violent crackdown by Iran’s theocracy, the scale of which is only starting to become clear as the country has faced more than two-week internet blackout — the most comprehensive in its history.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency on Monday put the death toll at 5,973, with the number expected to increase. It says more than 41,813 people have been arrested.\n\nThe group’s figures have been accurate in previous unrest and rely on a network of activists in Iran to verify deaths. That death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest there in decades, and recalls the chaos surrounding Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify the toll.\n\nIran’s government has put the death toll at a far lower 3,117, saying 2,427 were civilians and security forces, and labeled the rest “terrorists.” In the past, Iran’s theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from unrest.",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iranian authorities unveiled a new mural on a giant billboard in a central Tehran square on Sunday with a direct warning to the United States to not attempt a military strike on the country, as U.S. warships head to the region.\n\nThe image shows a bird's-eye view of an aircraft carrier with damaged and exploding fighter planes on its flight deck. The deck is strewn with bodies and streaked with blood that trails into the water behind the ship to form a pattern reminiscent of the stripes of the American flag. A slogan is emblazoned across one corner: “If you sow the wind, you will reap the whirlwind.”\n\nThe unveiling of the mural in Enghelab Square comes as the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and accompanying warships move toward the region. U.S. President Donald Trump has said the ships are being moved “just in case” he decides to take action.\n\n“We have a massive fleet heading in that direction and maybe we won’t have to use it,” Trump said Thursday.\n\nEnghelab Square is used for gatherings called by the state and authorities change its mural based on national occasions. On Saturday, the commander of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard warned that his force is “more ready than ever, finger on the trigger.”\n\nTension between the U.S. and Iran has spiked in the wake of a brutal crackdown on nationwide protests that saw thousands of people killed and tens of thousands arrested. Trump had threatened military action if Iran continued to kill peaceful protesters or carried out mass executions of those detained.\n\nThere have been no further protests for days and Trump claimed recently that Tehran had halted the planned execution of about 800 arrested protesters — a claim Iran’s top prosecutor called “completely false.”\n\nBut Trump has indicated he is keeping his options open, saying on Thursday that any military action would make last June’s U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites “look like peanuts.”\n\nU.S. Central Command said on social media that its Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle now has a presence in the Middle East, noting the fighter jet “enhances combat readiness and promotes regional security and stability.”\n\nSimilarly, the U.K. Ministry of Defense said Thursday that it deployed its Typhoon fighter jets to Qatar “in a defensive capacity.”\n\nThe protests in Iran began on Dec. 28, sparked by the fall of the Iranian currency, the rial, and quickly spread across the country. They were met by a violent crackdown by Iran’s theocracy, which does not tolerate dissent.\n\nThe death toll reported by activists has continued to rise since the end of the demonstrations, as information trickles out despite a more than two-week internet blackout — the most comprehensive in Iran’s history.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency on Sunday put the death toll at 5,848, with the number expected to increase.

    "description": "A Pentagon watchdog found confusing counter-drone policies are leaving some US military bases vulnerable to drone incursions.",
    "fullText": "A Pentagon watchdog report is warning that gaps in Pentagon policy are leaving some US military bases vulnerable to drone threats.\n\nThe report, released Tuesday by the Pentagon's Inspector General, said that the military lacks consistent guidance for defending sensitive \"covered assets\" — US-based sites legally authorized to use certain counter-drone defenses — against offensive uncrewed aircraft, a problem exacerbated by jumbled, contradictory policies across the services.\n\nWhile the Defense Department has issued multiple counter-UAS policies — rules governing how the military can detect, disrupt, or disable uncrewed aerial systems — those directives are not standardized, leaving some base leaders unaware that their installations qualify as \"covered assets.\" The term refers to locations within the US that deal with sensitive missions like nuclear deterrence, missile defense, presidential protection, air defense, and \"high yield\" explosives.\n\nThat lack of awareness derived from confusing policy risks leaving bases exposed to uncrewed threats, a growing concern.\n\nThe Inspector General report examines 10 military installations where drone incursions have occurred. The watchdog assessment found multiple examples of \"covered assets\" left uncovered due to unclear policies.\n\nThe Air Force base in Arizona where most F-35 pilots are trained, for instance, is not authorized to defend against UAS incursions because pilot training does not qualify as a \"covered\" activity under Pentagon policy, despite the Air Force describing the F-35 as \"an indispensable tool in future homeland defense.\"\n\nAnother Air Force facility in California that manufactures aircraft repair parts, conducts aircraft maintenance, and makes the Global Hawk, an ultra-advanced large surveillance drone that costs more than the F-35A, has also been left vulnerable, and the site experienced a series of drone incursions in 2024, the report said.\n\n\"Air Force officials told us that the government-owned, contractor-operated facility was denied coverage during the active incursions,\" in 2024, the IG report says.\n\nThe problem extends beyond determining whether a site is covered. The process for obtaining counter-drone systems — and securing rapid legal approval to use them when needed — is complex and slow, reflecting legal restrictions on using electronic jamming or force inside the US, the report found.\n\nConcerns about drone threats to military installations have grown in recent years as small, inexpensive commercial drones have become dramatically more popular and easy to use. Such systems lower the barrier to entry on surveillance and precision strike from the state level to non-state actors and can create challenges for security personnel who are often constrained in their response options, or improperly trained and equipped to react.\n\nIn 2024, multiple bases within the US and abroad experienced strings of drone incursions, events that can involve one or more unmanned aircraft entering restricted airspace or operating close enough to installations to trigger alarms, even when the drones are not linked to foreign adversaries.\n\n\"In recent years, adversary unmanned systems have evolved rapidly,\" a Department of Defense counter-drone strategy released in the final months of the Biden administration said. \"These cheap systems are increasingly changing the battlefield, threatening US installations, and wounding or killing our troops.\"\n\nEfforts to address the drone problem have been in the works for years, though a Center for New American Security report released last September said the military's efforts were \"hindered by insufficient scale and urgency.\"\n\nSome units have received counter-drone tools such as portable \"flyaway kits\" — deployable systems meant to be moved quickly between sites — and the \"Dronebuster,\" a handheld electronic-warfare device that emits a signal to disrupt or disable an offending drone. The Army secretary recently questioned the latter system's effectiveness, underscoring broader uncertainty about how best to defend US bases from the growing drone threat.\n\nThe US military is trying to catch up with the threat, to develop defenses as fast or faster than drone technology is currently developing, driven in large part by the drone-dominant Ukraine war. As he announced the creation of Joint Interagency Task Force 401 last August, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said \"there's no doubt that the threats we face today from hostile drones grow by the day.\"\n\n\"The challenge for airspace management is how to deter or defeat such incursions without endangering the surrounding civilian communities or legitimate air traffic. That rules out everything kinetic,\" Mark Cancian, a defense expert and retired US Marine Corps colonel, told Business Insider in late 2024 during a series of incursions.\n\n\"This has become a huge problem for both military and civilian airfields and will get worse and drone usage proliferates further,\" he said.",

    "description": "China's most senior general is under investigation, China's defence ministry said on Saturday, in the highest-profile purge to date of senior military leadership just as Beijing",
    "fullText": "Jan 24 (Reuters) - China's most senior general is under investigation, China's defence ministry said on Saturday, in the highest-profile purge to date of senior military leadership just as Beijing modernises its forces and tries to further project its might.\n\nZhang Youxia serves as second-in-command under President Xi Jinping as vice-chairman of the Central ​Military Commission - the supreme command body - and has long been seen as Xi's closest military ally.\n\nThe ministry said Zhang and Liu Zhenli, chief of staff of the ‌CMC's Joint Staff Department, were under investigation for suspected serious violations of discipline and law.\n\nZhang is also a member of the elite Politburo of the ruling Communist Party and is one of just a few leading officers with ‌combat experience.\n\nSWEEPING CRACKDOWN TARGETS MILITARY\n\nThe military was one of the main targets of a broad corruption crackdown ordered by Xi in 2012. That drive reached the upper echelons of the People's Liberation Army in 2023 when the elite Rocket Force was targeted.\n\nZhang's removal is the second of a sitting general on the Central Military Commission since the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. He has not been seen in public since November 20, when he held talks with Russia's defence minister in Moscow.\n\nForeign diplomats and security analysts are watching developments closely, given Zhang's closeness to Xi and the importance of the commission's work ⁠in terms of command as well as the PLA's ongoing ‌military modernisation and posture.\n\nWhile China has not fought a war in decades, it is taking an increasingly muscular line in the disputed East China Sea and South China Sea, as well as over the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which is claimed by China. Beijing staged the ‍largest military exercises to date around Taiwan late last year.\n\nSingapore-based China security scholar James Char said the military's daily operations could carry on as normal despite the purges but the targeting of Zhang showed Xi was reacting to criticism that the crackdown had been too selective.\n\n\"Xi has been tapping on second-line PLA officers to fill those roles vacated by their predecessors – on an interim basis in most cases,\" said Char, ​a scholar at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.\n\n\"China’s military modernizers will continue to push for the two goals Xi has set for the PLA – namely, 2035 to basically complete ‌its modernisation and 2049 to become a world-class armed forces.\"\n\nZhang is the second vice chair of the CMC to fall from grace in recent months. Former CMC vice chair He Weidong was expelled from the party and PLA in October last year for corruption. He was replaced by Zhang Shengmin.\n\nEight top generals were expelled from the Communist Party on graft charges in October 2025, including He Weidong.\n\nTwo former defence ministers were also purged from the ruling party in recent years for corruption. The crackdown is slowing procurement of advanced weaponry and hitting the revenues of some of China's biggest defence firms.\n\nBoth Xi and Zhang are from the northwestern province of Shaanxi and are the children of former senior officials who fought together ⁠in the 1940s civil war.\n\nBorn in Beijing, Zhang joined the army in 1968, rising through the ranks ​and joining the military commission in late 2012 as the PLA's modernisation drive gathered pace.\n\nA Pentagon profile of Zhang ​in late 2023 noted that Zhang had been expected to retire in 2022, aged 72, given usual military practice.\n\n\"However, Zhang's retention on the CMC for a third term probably reflects Xi's desire to keep a close and experienced ally as his top military adviser,\" the profile said, contained within the ‍Pentagon's annual report on China's military that year.\n\nHe ⁠fought Vietnam in a brief but bloody border war in 1979 that China launched in punishment for Vietnam invading Cambodia the previous year and ousting the Beijing-backed Khmer Rouge.\n\nZhang was 26 when he was sent to the front lines to fight the Vietnamese and was quickly promoted, according to state media. He also fought in another border ⁠clash with Vietnam in 1984 as the conflict rumbled on.\n\n\"During the battle, whether attacking or defending, Zhang Youxia performed excellently,\" the official China Youth Daily wrote in a 2017 piece entitled, \"These Chinese generals have killed the enemy ‌on the battlefield\".\n\nSome China scholars have noted that Zhang emerged from the conflict an avowed moderniser in terms of military tactics, weapons and the need for ‌a better trained force.",

    "description": "DoD is reportedly considering cutting ties with the Boy Scouts, even as data from military schools shows Scouting is common among future officers.",
    "fullText": "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is reportedly considering severing ties with Scouting America, which could mean a consequential break with an organization that has long been closely associated with military service and leadership development.\n\nPublic data from two prominent military schools, West Point and the Naval Academy, shows that Scouting is common among future officers — more than one in ten cadets and about 10% of midshipmen in recent years have a Scouting background.\n\nA memo obtained by NPR in November highlighted Hegseth's desire to halt military support for the Scouts' National Jamboree and group activities on military bases.\n\nThe Pentagon declined to provide a copy of the memo to Business Insider and did not comment on details surrounding any potential separation.\n\n\"The Department will not comment on leaked documents that we cannot authenticate and that may be pre-decisional,\" Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said in an email when asked whether the Pentagon still plans to move forward with severing ties.\n\nScouting America did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nThe Scouts' Jamboree has long been a highly visible point of contact between the military and American youth. In 2017, the event featured a significant military presence — simulated helicopter rescues, displays of tanks and aircraft, flyovers, drill team performances, a special operations challenge, and other opportunities for Scouts to interact directly with service members.\n\nWhether the 2026 Jamboree events will feature similar military involvement remains to be seen (the Jamboree is usually held once every four years.) The reported memo on the Pentagon's intended split with the Scouts decried the organization as \"woke.\"\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America began admitting girls in 2018, while the Girl Scouts remains a separate organization. The group had earlier opened its programs to transgender boys in 2017 and to gay boys in 2013.\n\nIn 2024, before Hegseth became the defense secretary, he remarked that Scouts had been \"cratering\" for some time during a Fox News show. He accused the political left of trying to \"destroy it or dilute it into something that stood for nothing.\"\n\nThis new uncertainty comes at a time of relative stability for military recruiting, after a yearslong crisis that peaked during the COVID-19 pandemic. Enlistment numbers have rebounded in large part because of a shaky job market and the Army and Navy's preparatory courses, which help otherwise unqualified applicants improve their fitness and test scores enough to qualify for boot camp.\n\nThose pre-boot camp programs have drawn scrutiny though. A government watchdog report last year found they allowed in too many low-scoring recruits, raising concerns about long-term readiness and standards.\n\nEven with recruiting off to a strong start in the new fiscal year, looming challenges remain. A declining national birthrate — expected to become more pronounced over the coming decade — means the military will face a smaller pool of eligible young people in the years ahead. That makes early exposure to service-oriented institutions especially important, said Kate Kuszminski, the director of studies at the Center for a New American Security and author of a recent report on recruiting.\n\nScouting, she told Business Insider, can give young people two things the military has long valued: moral grounding and early exposure to skills that translate to service.\n\n\"The scouting system provides quite a few tangible things well before youth are of recruiting age that could pay dividends in the long run,\" Kuszminski said.\n\nData from West Point highlights that overlap. About 14% of the Academy's graduating class of 2027 reported a background in Scouting, according to the publicly available data. More than half of those former Scouts had earned the Eagle Scout or Girl Scouts' Gold Award.\n\nThe data does not distinguish between male and female Scouts.\n\nThat pattern has held steady in recent years. For the graduating classes of 2022 through 2026, between 13% and 16% of students reported having a Scouting background. In the classes of 2025, 2026, and 2027, the number of former Scouts was nearly equal to the number of cadets who entered West Point from Junior ROTC programs.\n\nComparable data for the Naval Academy is harder to find, but a class profile for the class of 2028 lists roughly 10% of students as former Scouts.\n\nFor some veterans, those numbers are unsurprising. The Scouts have long had some overlap with military service, said David Chetlain, a Navy veteran and former Boy Scout. His own experience in Scouting reinforced a sense of service that he says is increasingly hard for students to find elsewhere.\n\n\"You want to teach young people that they're part of a community and that they should be involved in it,\" Chetlain said. Children learn a lot from team-building activities like school sports, he said, \"but you don't learn citizenship, you don't learn service, and you don't necessarily learn leadership in the same way.\"\n\n\"They're trying to prepare people for life, and those same attributes that make you successful in life will make you successful in the military,\" he added. \"That's why I think the relationship is important.\"\n\nThe reported rift with the Scouts comes as the Pentagon searches for new and innovative ways to sustain recruiting momentum with its new Recruitment Task Force. Few details about its scope or recommendations have been made public.",

    "fullText": "Lawmakers and military families denounced President Donald Trump’s shocking remarks denigrating NATO troops who were injured and died fighting for the U.S. in Afghanistan after the September 11 terror attacks.\n\nSpeaking to Fox Business on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on Thursday, Trump questioned whether NATO “will be there if we ever need them.”\n\n“We’ve never needed them,” he told Maria Bartiromo. “We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they’ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, and they did—they stayed a little back, little off the front lines. But we’ve been very good to Europe and to many other countries.”\n\nHis message sparked outrage in the U.K., which sent more than 150,000 troops to Afghanistan in the years following the U.S.-led invasion in 2001.\n\nThe British contingency, which, after the U.S., was the second largest of the campaign, lost 457 soldiers, while thousands more were injured.\n\n“They were absolutely on the front lines,” Lucy Aldridge, whose son William died in Afghanistan when he was 18, told The Mirror. “And to ignore that because, let’s face it, Trump isn’t particularly hot on history… He is so out of touch with the reality, and what it costs in human life. He has no compassion whatsoever for anyone who doesn’t serve him.”\n\nDiane Dernie, whose son Ben Parkinson suffered horrific injuries in Afghanistan in 2006, said Trump’s latest comments were “the ultimate insult.”\n\nStarmer’s official spokesperson pointed out that the response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks was the only time NATO has invoked Article 5, the alliance’s collective defense principle that treats an attack on one member as an attack on all, The Telegraph reported.\n\n“Their sacrifice and that of other Nato allies was made in the service of collective security and in response to an attack on our ally,” Starmer’s spokesperson said of the soldiers who were wounded and killed. “The president was wrong to diminish the role of NATO troops.”\n\nStarmer later called Trump’s comments about NATO troops “insulting and frankly appalling.”\n\n“I will never forget their courage, their bravery and the sacrifice they made for their country,” he said. “I consider President Trump’s remarks to be insulting and frankly appalling and I am not surprised they have caused such hurt to the loved ones of those who were killed or injured and, in fact, across the country.”\n\nStarmer said Trump should apologize for the comments.\n\nEven the Conservative Party blasted Trump’s remarks, with Tory leader Kemi Badenoch calling them “absolutely appalling” and “disgraceful,” according to The Telegraph.\n\nConservative member of Parliament Ben Obese-Jecty, who served in Afghanistan as a captain in the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, said it was “sad to see our nation’s sacrifice, and that of our NATO partners, held so cheaply by the president of the United States,” according to ABC.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nThe president’s dumping on NATO troops was reminiscent of his previous comments about Americans who died in combat being “suckers” and “losers.”\n\nDuring a trip to France in 2018, the president said American soldiers who died on French soil during WWI were “losers,” and that U.S. Marines who helped halt the 1918 German advance toward Paris were “suckers” for dying at the hands of the enemy.\n\nThe White House denied reports of the comments, which were revealed by The Atlantic magazine in 2020, but they’re just one example of the president disparaging military veterans and their families.\n\nIn December, he struggled to muster much sympathy for the families of Americans—many of them U.S. military veterans—who have died fighting in Ukraine.\n\nHe has mocked the late Sen. John McCain’s war injuries, publicly insulted the parents of a 27-year-old soldier who died in a car bombing in Iraq, and privately raged about the funeral costs for a female soldier who was murdered by a male soldier at Fort Hood.",

    "description": "Military competition between the US and rivals Russia and China in the Arctic is exposing weaknesses in the US arsenal.",
    "fullText": "For war across the freezing Arctic battlefields, the US faces a problem: it doesn't have the right weapons or tools to reliably detect threats in the region and respond to them quickly.\n\nThe Arctic is an unforgiving place for a war. It's a location where distances are vast, subzero temperatures can cripple equipment, and forces must operate with limited support infrastructure, but as competition with US rivals and adversaries becomes fiercer, there is a growing realization that a future fight could unfold across an Arctic battlespace. Among experts and officials, there's also increasing concern about US readiness.\n\nIf US forces in the region can't spot threats early, position assets effectively, and sustain troops in harsh conditions, the region could become a corridor for undetected attacks.\n\nGaps in Arctic defenses have been one element of President Donald Trump's erratic rhetoric on US interests in the acquisition of Greenland. He has said it is necessary for the substantial US missile defense project known as Golden Dome.\n\n\"If there is a war, much of the action will take place on that piece of ice,\" Trump said on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"Think of it: those missiles would be flying right over the center.\"\n\nThe president isn't the first to call attention to the strategic and national security implications surrounding the Arctic. Warnings have come from across administrations.\n\nLeaders in Washington have expressed similar concerns about the importance of the Arctic region for homeland defense in recent years. In its 2024 Arctic strategy doctrine, the US Department of Defense emphasized the need for better, more modernized all-domain awareness, surveillance and sensors, naval capabilities, and missile warning technologies. Existing systems, the department said, weren't sufficient for the growing threats in the region.\n\nSpecifically, the US, along with some of its NATO allies, has underinvested in capabilities needed to detect, track, and respond to activity across vast Arctic distances.\n\nSome necessary capabilities include aerial and underwater surveillance, as well as defense and naval warfare capabilities like anti-submarine frigates, heavy icebreakers, polar-capable multi-mission surface vessels, and dual-use sealift capacity, Liselotte Odgaard, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, wrote in a new report. Infrastructure such as undersea sensor networks, command and control systems, ports, runways, and roads is also lacking.\n\n\"As a result, the US and its allies have insufficient monitoring, response, and sustainment options,\" she explained. \"These shortfalls allow adversaries to transit waters and territories undetected, sustain forces in combat theaters for prolonged periods, and successfully challenge allied forces in combat-like situations.\"\n\nUS presence, whether through domain awareness or more constant exercises in the region, has also been lacking, leaving the Arctic as the \"shortest and least defended threat sector,\" former deputy commander of US Northern Command, Army Gen. Thomas Carden, said in 2024.\n\nWith recognition of the challenges has come new efforts. Recent moves, like the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Coast Guard’s fiscal year 2026 budget, have included millions of dollars for new icebreakers, Coast Guard cutters, and needed Arctic infrastructure upgrades. The Coast Guard’s newly renamed Arctic District has taken on a more prominent monitoring role, and last year, the service received its first polar icebreaker in over 25 years.\n\nAdditionally, the US is working to field new air defense systems and interceptors to replace or supplement the ones in Alaska. And the Space Force's 2026 budget includes billions for Golden Dome, specifically space-based sensors and interceptors, and modernization efforts at Pituffik Space Base in Greenland.\n\nBut key areas remain underdeveloped.\n\nAs Odgaard wrote in her new report, parts of the airspace over eastern Greenland and the North Pole are not consistently surveilled, and the submarine detection and tracking capabilities along Greenland's eastern coast fall short of what is needed.\n\nThose gaps are concerning as Russia focuses on expanding submarine operations in the Arctic.\n\nUncrewed systems, both naval and aerial drones, could, in theory, extend surveillance coverage across vast areas that are expensive and difficult to patrol without increasing the demand on traditional crewed aircraft and assets.\n\nThe harsh Arctic environment could challenge such efforts. With drones, it could stress their batteries, range, connections, and performance. Recent exercises have shown troops that temperatures below freezing, low visibility, snowy or icy conditions, and strong winds can degrade aerial drones and other equipment.\n\nThe US' renewed investments in preparation for Arctic warfare come as Russia and China are deepening cooperation and more actively pursuing interests in the region. Russia has been looking to expand where its submarines can operate as China positions itself strategically as a \"near Arctic\" nation, joining Russia on joint patrols, including ones near Alaska. China is also investing in naval capabilities, ships, and drones for the region.",

North Korea, for example, is one of the world's most repressive states, led by a dictator who has repeatedly threatened neighboring South Korea.\n\nThe number of active-duty military personnel is far from the only factor that matters when comparing military power between countries, but it shows latent power that could be augmented via conscription and calling up reservists.\n\n\"Numbers have value, but there's a lot more to military capability,\" said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, DC-based foreign policy and national security think tank.\n\nIISS, a London-headquartered think tank, counts active armed forces, reservists, and paramilitaries as separate categories in its analysis, showing a fuller picture of each nation's manpower.\n\nSome countries have significantly higher numbers of reservists than others — Vietnam has the largest number in the world, estimated at 5 million.\n\nBut while reservists can aid militaries when needed, the quality and longevity of their expertise can vary between conscription- and volunteer-based systems, Cancian told Business Insider.\n\n\"When you look at some countries' reserve numbers, you're often looking at people who haven't trained in 10 or 20 years,\" he said. \"It gives you a big number, but their military value is questionable.\"\n\nAnd while paramilitaries can be effective at enforcing internal security and party strength, Cancian says that \"as a military force, they have essentially zero value.\"\n\nEven when accounting for all of a military's manpower, personnel is only one of the various factors that can qualify a nation's military strength, which also include equipment and readiness.\n\nThere's also the role of technologies in global warfare, the size and sophistication of air forces and naval fleets, amphibious capabilities to land assault forces, command and control systems, or nuclear forces, which all shape military power. Larger and more advanced forces require higher state expenditures.\n\nStill, comparing global manpower offers insight into how countries prioritize military power.\n\nSee how the world's largest militaries stack up.",

    "description": "Despite geopolitical upheaval, sanctions, and military action, this South American state's proven oil reserves remain colossal.",
    "fullText": "When it comes to oil-rich countries, one would usually think of Middle Eastern nations like Saudi Arabia or Iraq. But what many do not know is that the country with the largest oil reserves in the world lies just 1,200 miles to the south of Florida — or about a three-and-a-half-hour flight across the Caribbean. This is the state of Venezuela, and the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that its oil reserves are at more than 303 billion barrels, as of 2025.\n\nMost of Venezuela's oil is in the Orinoco Belt, a swathe of land north of the Orinoco River, but extracting it poses an unusual set of challenges. The country's oil infrastructure needs to be overhauled due to years of mismanagement and corruption and a history of asset seizures from private companies by the state. The country is also under U.S. sanctions, which limit its ability to sell oil overseas.\n\nVenezuela's crude oil isn't easy to process, either. Saudi Arabian and American oil fields produce light, sweet crude oil, which contains very little sulfur, and isn't corrosive to pipes and equipment. On the other hand, Venezuelan oil is much harder to process because it's mostly heavy and sour, making it harder to process crude oil into unleaded gasoline. Prof. Paasha Mahdavi of the University of California, Santa Barbara, told NPR that it's \"among the dirtiest oils in the world to produce when it comes to global warming.\"\n\nAside from Venezuela, other countries that have massive reserves include Saudi Arabia (267 billion barrels), Iran (208 billion barrels), Iraq (145 billion barrels), and the United Arab Emirates (113 billion barrels). The United States sits in the top eight, with an estimated 45 billion barrels of crude oil in reserve.\n\nOne thing that allowed the U.S. to massively increase its oil reserves and become one of the top 10 countries with the largest oil reserves is the development of fracking. Unlike traditional oil extraction techniques, which siphoned oil deposits from porous material, fracking pumps a special type of fluid deep underground to break the dense rock that holds the oil and make it easier to extract.\n\nOther nations are continually exploring to find new oil fields within their borders, and the U.S. made a new discovery in Texas in January 2026, which potentially has 1.6 billion barrels of oil. So, if there's a new substantial find or new technologies are developed to efficiently extract more oil from existing wells, then it's possible that another state can overtake Venezuela as the largest oil reserve holder in the world.",

    "description": "President Trump called the UK's decision to give away the Chagos Islands \"an act of great stupidity\" and a reason for the US to acquire Greenland.",
    "fullText": "That is what President Donald Trump called the UK's decision to give away a group of islands where a strategic military base is located.\n\nThe Diego Garcia military base is a cornerstone of US and allied power projection across the Indo-Pacific, the Middle East, and parts of Africa. As the UK moves to transfer sovereignty of the islands, its strategic importance has turned the base into a political and diplomatic flash point.\n\nThe island's strategic location has long made it especially valuable for US military operations, including long-range bomber missions and naval deployments — a role underscored by satellite images last year showing US bombers operating from the base.\n\nLocated in the Chagos Islands, Diego Garcia became the site of a US-UK military installation after Britain forcibly removed the native Chagossian people in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Seven years ago, in 2019, the International Court of Justice ruled that the removals were unlawful and said that the UK should relinquish control of the islands.\n\nThe UK has since reached a deal to transfer the sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius, near Madagascar, while allowing Diego Garcia to remain under British control on a 99-year lease, with an option to renew. The arrangement is expected to cost the UK about $136 million a year.\n\nThe UK government's decision was previously praised by the Trump administration as a \"monumental achievement\" that secured \"the long-term, stable, and effective operation of the joint US-UK military facility at Diego Garcia.\"\n\nTrump's assessment appears to have shifted.\n\n\"Shockingly, our 'brilliant' NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital U.S. Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER,\" the president wrote on Truth Social Tuesday.\n\nHe said there was \"no doubt\" that Russia and China had \"noticed this act of total weakness,\" arguing that the UK \"giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY.\"\n\nHe stressed that the move \"is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired.\" Trump has been increasingly focused on taking control of Greenland lately. He has argued its needed for Golden Dome, among other reasons.\n\nThe British prime minister's office told the BBC that \"the president explicitly recognised its strength last year,\" adding that the Five Eyes intelligence agencies also approved of the transfer.\n\nTrump said at the White House later on Tuesday that the deal had changed from its original format. \"I think they should keep it,\" he said.\n\nDiego Garcia has been a secretive military installation for the US and UK since the early 1970s. It's extremely remote, far from nearby landmasses, and strategically placed so that the US and UK have air power and maritime reach from the Indian Ocean toward the Middle East, Indo-Pacific, and Africa.\n\nThe base hosts units from the US Navy, Air Force, and Space Force, as well as the UK Royal Navy. Due to its geographical location, Diego Garcia is also critical for refueling operations for military aircraft and vessels. American bombers, such as B-1 Lancers, B-2 Spirits, and B-52 Stratofortresses, have been seen at the base, as well as nuclear-powered submarines.\n\nFrom Diego Garcia, US bombers launched attacks in Afghanistan after 9/11 and against Iraq during the 2003 invasion. And in 1991, the installation was central to US attacks during the first Gulf War. The base was crucial to the logistics operations supporting Middle Eastern missions, keeping aircraft nearby and operational.\n\nThe B-2 bomber holding the record for the longest bombing run in history landed at Diego Garcia after flying over 44 hours from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri in 2001.\n\nIn June 2025, prior to US attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities, or Operation Midnight Hammer, experts speculated that a significant B-2 bomber presence spotted at Diego Garcia could be involved in some sort of strike on Iran. Imagery at the time showed a notable force posture there. The actual strike, however, involved a B-2 bomber task force that flew out of the US.",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum quelled concerns on Monday about two recent movements of the U.S. military in the vicinity of Mexico that have the country on edge since the attack on Venezuela.\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration urged U.S. aircraft operators to “exercise caution” when flying over the eastern Pacific Ocean near Mexico, Central America and parts of South America, citing “military activities.”\n\nThe president said her administration waited a couple hours until the U.S. government provided “written” assurance that there would not be any U.S. military flights over Mexican territory. She said the U.S. government had not given Mexico a heads up about any military operations.\n\nThe U.S. government provided precise coordinates for where it was operating and Mexican authorities issued a statement saying the FAA advisory had no implications for Mexico.\n\nThen, images of a U.S. military transport airplane on the tarmac at Toluca’s airport about 39 miles (63 kilometers) west of Mexico City began circulating on social media.\n\nSen. Clemente Castañeda, of the opposition Citizen Movement party, posted on social platform X asking for an explanation from the government, because Mexico’s senate is supposed to approve sending Mexican troops abroad or allowing foreign troops into Mexico.\n\nSheinbaum described it as a “logistical” operation that did not require senate approval.\n\n“The United States plane landed, public servants got on that plane and they went (to the U.S.) for training,” Sheinbaum said. “Who authorized this? The Secretary of Defense.”\n\nHer security cabinet had posted on X Sunday night that such training operations “occur in conformity with established protocols and in adherence to the bilateral collaboration agreements.”\n\nBoth events highlighted the sensitivity created by not only the Trump administration’s unilateral action to capture Venezuela's then-President Nicolás Maduro earlier this month, but the subsequent renewal of offers and threats to take direct military action against the drug cartels in Mexico.\n\nSheinbaum and Trump spoke again last week on the subject. Both governments continue to say they will collaborate on security issues, with Mexico emphasizing that it will not accept violations of its sovereignty.\n\nSecurity officials from both countries are scheduled to meet again Friday in an effort to “continue delivering tangible actions to strengthen security cooperation and meaningful outcomes to counter cartels, and stop the illicit flow of fentanyl and weapons from crossing our shared border,” according to a joint statement released last Thursday.",

    "fullText": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is getting the message: He’s vulnerable to the same quick hit that President Trump ordered to pluck Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro from power and toss him into custody in New York.\n\nThe brazen Jan. 3 raid on Caracas by U.S. forces almost certainly struck more fear into the potbellied dictator than any military drills or aerial shows of force ever could. In doing so, it’s also ramped up the risks of a potential nuclear showdown as Kim goes into panic mode, triggered by the same American president who has routinely boasted of the pair’s “very good relationship.”\n\n“The operation to ‘rendition’ the president of Venezuela demonstrates the capabilities that have to be of concern to North Korea,” says Sydney Seiler, former national intelligence officer for North Korea at the National Intelligence Council. The word “rendition,” as used by Seiler, is CIA-speak for capturing an enemy operative and sending him elsewhere for prosecution, or even torture and killing.\n\nThe other key word is “decapitation,” which Kim is well aware the Americans have been practicing in annual military exercises for years. “What’s appealing is that decapitation is the quickest way to terminate a conflict,” Seiler, who visited North Korea on negotiating teams before the North cut off all communications after the failure of Kim’s meetings with Trump in 2019, told the influential Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\n“Decapitation would be helpful in trying to deter North Korea,” Seiler believes. “Without Kim Jong Un,” he notes, North Korea would have no leader, no one who would know how to lead its outsized, underfed armed forces of 1.2 million troops, much less anyone in charge of its nuclear program.\n\nKim betrayed his deepest fears of a plot like the fracas in Caracas by authorizing release for North Korean audiences of a film all about the capture of Maduro. The film “Days and Nights of Confrontation,” could not have aired on North Korean state TV at a more propitious moment, days after elite U.S. troops seized Maduro and his wife. The message is clear: what’s to stop the Americans from repeating themselves in North Korea?\n\nThe film epitomizes “the trend of racy, Hollywood-style content aimed at appealing to young people,” says a South Korean website, NK News, that tracks North Korea. “Surely Mr. Kim and his family, including his fiery younger sister Yo-Jong, and his beloved teenage daughter, Ju-ae, would make great targets.” In one fell swoop the Americans could wipe out the dynasty that Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il-Sung, founded when the Soviet Union installed him as leader of the northern half of the divided Korean peninsula after the Japanese surrender in 1945.\n\nCapturing Kim is not a new idea for American “rendition” experts.\n\n“Some White House aides believed his death would paralyze his country,” writes Joel Wit, who also joined negotiating teams to North Korea, inspecting the nuclear site at Yongbyon north of Pyongyang after North Korea signed an agreement in 1994 to stop producing nukes. “Go get Kim Jong Un, we were postured to do that,” says Wit in his tell-all book, Fallout: The Inside Story of America’s Failure to Disarm North Korea. One official is quoted as saying: “Everyone, including the North Koreans, knew killing him as part of the war plan.”\n\nMaybe the U.S. would have to marshal more than the 150 or so aircraft, and a few hundred troops, including the U.S. Army’s elite Delta Force, that were needed to grab Maduro, but Kim is well aware his family and entourage could be hustled aboard a helicopter bound for an American warship long before the Russians and Chinese could respond in support of North Korea’s military establishment, ill-fed, ill-trained and not at all ready to leap to their leader’s instant defense.\n\nIf capturing Kim sounds like mission impossible, consider his frequent appearances inspecting industrial and agricultural projects, reviewing troops, and presiding at ceremonies. He also shows up periodically at missile launches, perhaps the best time of all to catch him just as he’s making a show of pressing the button. The Americans, moreover, are steeped in the knowledge of what it will take to get him. U.S. forces have been training for years to go after him. Annual U.S.-South Korean exercises once routinely wound up with a mock “decapitation” of “the North Korean leader,” without explicitly naming Kim.\n\nThe U.S. command in Korea dropped the word “decapitation” from the war games in deference to their South Korean ally, who reminded them such language might not help in attempts at fruitless talks with the North Koreans, who now refuse to talk anyway. The word is gaining currency again with Maduro’s capture—while raising the question in Pyongyang of who might come next on the American hit list.\n\n“North Korea’s Kim expected to cling to [his] nuclear security blanket after Venezuela,” blared one headline in the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post. “The United States’ decapitation operation against Venezuela will reinforce North Korea’s nuclear ambitions,” read another. That warning should prompt Trump to act quickly to get rid of a nuisance who’s been plaguing the region for years with bombastic harangues, threatening his enemies with a nuclear holocaust while his own people suffer from hunger and disease.\n\nFlights of heavy American bombers do little or nothing to remove the threats posed by America’s foes. Kim knows he can laugh off another aerial show of intimidation or a useless meeting with Trump. The threat of a Maduro-style capture is far more effective. Kim’s worst fear is that the Americans, after rehearsing “decapitation” for years, will decide it’s time to finally put their plan into effect, stifling Asia’s leading terrorist just as suddenly as they whisked Maduro and his wife off to jail in New York.",

    "description": "Oleksandr Syrskyi said that Russia is currently producing 404 Shaheds \"of various types\" per day.",
    "fullText": "Russia has plans to more than double production of its Iranian-designed attack drones to 1,000 per day, said Ukrainian Armed Forces' commander in chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi.\n\n\"The enemy plans to significantly increase production to use up to 1,000 drones per day,\" Syrskyi said of these drones.\n\nHe was speaking in an interview published on Sunday by the local media outlet LB.Ua, in which he commented on a wide range of topics, including the effectiveness of Ukraine's deep strikes into Russia and the balance of power in drone warfare.\n\nSyrskyi gave a precise assessment of Russia's current Shahed manufacturing, saying that Moscow can now produce 404 Shahed drones \"of various types\" every day.\n\nThese Russian delta-wing drones are closely modeled after Iran's loitering munitions. Moscow manufactures its own versions, dubbed Gerans, as well as cheaper decoys called Gerberas.\n\nRussia typically deploys a mix of strike drones and decoys when launching long-range attacks into Ukraine, and can send hundreds in a single night.\n\nSyrskyi did not say if Russia's daily Shahed production included Gerberas, nor did he break down exact production figures for each type of Shahed-type drone. The Geran-1 and Geran-2, propeller-driven drones that can fly up to 115 mph, are more common than the faster, jet-powered Geran-3.\n\nLaunching 1,000 Shahed-type drones a day would be a massive surge in Russia's attack capability. Moscow has generally been deploying 5,000 to 6,000 Shaheds a month against Ukraine, and half to four-fifths of these are usually strike variants.\n\nPer an analysis by the Institute for Science and International Security, Russia launched an average of 166 Shahed drones per day in December 2025. However, it's known to sometimes pause or reduce the intensity of its strikes to accumulate a stockpile for later use in a single large wave.\n\nCost is a major advantage for Shaheds. Each is estimated to cost between $20,000 and $70,000, making it cheaper and easier to manufacture than a conventional missile and providing Russia with a way to scale up its strike capability more sustainably.\n\nResource-strapped Ukraine has responded by seeking cheaper complements for its air defense network, including the growing use of small interceptor drones.\n\nStill, Russia's monthly use of Shahed-type drones has remained largely stagnant for the last six months. Moscow has, meanwhile, been experimenting with the loitering munitions, such as equipping them with air-to-air missiles or rear-facing cameras.\n\nSyrskyi's public assessment also comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned on Friday that his country was running low on ammunition for Western-supplied air defense systems.\n\nZelenskyy said that Ukraine had just secured a replenished stock of those munitions, but before that, it was fielding \"several systems without missiles.\"\n\n\"Today I can say this openly, because today, I have those missiles,\" he said.\n\nAs for other drones used in the war, Syrskyi said that Russia and Ukraine were now evenly matched in production quantity. Both Kyiv and Moscow have sporadically claimed the advantage on this front in recent years.\n\n\"The question is in quality. In conventional drones, quality is on our side. In fiber optics, unfortunately, we are only catching up with the enemy,\" Syrskyi said.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican lawmakers are scrambling to contain President Donald Trump's threats of taking possession of Greenland, with some showing the most strident opposition to almost anything the Trump administration has done since taking office.\n\nThey gave floor speeches on the importance of NATO last week. They introduced bills meant to prevent the U.S. from attacking Denmark. And several traveled to Copenhagen to meet with Danish counterparts.\n\nBut it's not clear that will be enough, as the president continues to insist that he will take control of the Arctic island. It's raised fears of an end to NATO — a decades-old alliance that has been a pillar of American strength in Europe and around the globe — and raised questions on Capitol Hill and around the world about what Trump's aggressive, go-it-alone foreign policy will mean for world order.\n\n“When the most powerful military nation on earth threatens your territory through its president over and over and over again, you start to take it seriously,” Sen. Chris Coons told The Associated Press.\n\nThe Delaware Democrat organized the bipartisan trip to Denmark to “bring the temperature down a bit,” he said, as well as further talks about mutual military agreements in the Arctic. Republican Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska accompanied a handful of Democrats on the trip. Also, Republican lawmakers joined in meetings in Washington last week with the Danish foreign minister and his Greenlandic counterpart where they discussed security agreements.\n\nYet it's clear Trump has other ideas. He said Saturday he will charge a 10% import tax starting in February on goods from eight European nations because of their opposition to his Greenland plans.\n\nTrump said on social media that because of modern weapons systems “the need to ACQUIRE is especially important.”\n\nThe pushback to Trump's Greenland plans\n\nKey Republicans have made clear they think that forcefully taking Greenland is out of the question. But so far, they've avoided directly rebuking Trump for his talk of possessing the island.\n\nTillis on social media called Trumps tariff plans “bad for America, bad for American businesses, and bad for America’s allies.”\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters Thursday that “there’s certainly not an appetite here for some of the options that have been talked about or considered.”\n\nIn a floor speech, Thune's predecessor as Republican leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell, warned that an attempt to seize Greenland would “shatter the trust of allies\" and tarnish Trump's legacy with a disastrous foreign policy decision.\n\nRepublican and Democratic lawmakers alike see an obvious path to bolstering American interests in Greenland while keeping the relationship with NATO-ally Denmark intact.\n\nIn a meeting with lawmakers Thursday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt discussed how the countries could work together to develop critical mineral industries and military cooperation, Coons said. The diplomats also told the senators there is no evidence of Chinese or Russian activity in Greenland.\n\nTrump has made the argument that the U.S. should take Greenland before China or Russia do, prompting worry across Europe. Troops from several nations have been sent to Greenland in support of Denmark.\n\nMurkowski said on social media that “our NATO allies are being forced to divert attention and resources to Greenland, a dynamic that plays directly into Putin’s hands by threatening the stability of the strongest coalition of democracies the world has ever seen.”\n\nLawmakers are looking at a few options for taking a military attack on Greenland off the table. Still, the Trump administration has shown little if any willingness to get congressional approval before taking military action.\n\nLawmakers, including Republicans like Murkowski, are pushing legislation that would prohibit Department of Defense funds from being used to attack or occupy territory that belongs to other NATO members without their consent.\n\nThe Alaska senator also suggested Congress could act to nullify Trump's tariffs. Murkowski and several other Republicans have already helped pass resolutions last year meant to undo tariffs around the globe, but those pieces of legislation did not gain traction in the House. They would have also required Trump's signature or support from two-thirds of both chambers to override his veto.\n\nDemocrats have also found some traction with war powers resolutions meant to force the president to get congressional approval before engaging in hostilities. Republicans last week narrowly defeated one such resolution that would prohibit Trump from attacking Venezuela again, and Democrats think there could potentially be more Republicans who would support one applying to Greenland.\n\n“What I’ve noticed is these war powers resolutions, they do put some pressure on Republicans,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat who has forced votes on several similar resolutions. He said the tactic has also compelled the Trump administration to provide lawmakers with briefings and commitments to get congressional approval before deploying troops.\n\nStill, while dismissing the Venezuela war powers resolution on Wednesday, Republican leaders made the argument that the legislation should be ruled out of order because the Trump administration has said there are currently no U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela.\n\nThat argument may set a precedent for future war powers resolutions, giving Republicans a way to avoid voting against Trump's wishes.\n\n“If you don't have boots on the ground, it's a moot point,” said Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, about war powers resolutions in general. He also argued that the prospect of taking Greenland over the objections of Denmark is nothing \"more than a hypothetical.”\n\nOther Republicans have expressed support for Trump's insistence that the U.S. possess Greenland, though they have downplayed the idea that the U.S. would take it by force.\n\nThat's left the strongest objections on the Republican side of the aisle coming from a handful of lawmakers who are leaving Congress next year.\n\nRep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, told The Omaha World Herald that an invasion of Greenland would lead to Trump's impeachment — something he would “lean” towards supporting.\n\nTillis, another retiring Republican, has directed his criticism at Trump advisors like White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller.\n\n“The fact that a small handful of ‘advisors’ are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid,” he said.",

    "fullText": "Of all the explanations for Donald Trump’s attempt to seize Greenland, the most superficially attractive is that the President has dementia. In which case, why not just pretend to give it to him? Fly him to somewhere that looks green, throw a military parade, and tell him that’s it. Senile fantasy fulfilled.\n\nAlas, the rot goes so much deeper. Trump is not mad, he’s doing what America always does, just crassly and out in the open. This became clearer this week when I chanced upon a copy of Lament for a Nation by the Canadian philosopher George Grant, published in 1965.\n\nGrant wrote at a turning point in his country’s history. In 1957, Canada had elected a conservative PM called John Diefenbaker who was not unlike Nigel Farage or, indeed, Trump: populist, nationalist, deeply anti-Left. But when the Americans asked to put their nuclear weapons on his soil, Diefenbaker – to my surprise – said no.\n\nHe believed he had a right to do this because Nato is, on paper, an alliance of equals – and a necessity because once Canada became a missile base, all pretence of an independent foreign policy would end.\n\nThe business and cultural elite turned on Diefenbaker and the public kicked him out of office.\n\nAmerica, basking in the glow of Jack Kennedy, was then admired as the embodiment of modernity: nationalism seemed antiquated and eccentric. Thus, argued Grant, Canada’s nuclear surrender represented the final stage in a process of economic and cultural assimilation. A society so integrated into the American Way lacked not just the resources but, crucially, the imagination to stand on its own two feet.\n\nSo it goes with contemporary Europe, where American corporations dominate and profit, yet also avoid paying a lot of tax. Ireland, for example, has rightly denounced Trump’s tariff war on the nations that oppose his aggressive takeover of Greenland – yet the country is a model of globalist acquiescence at the cost of sovereignty. It has embraced free markets (low corporate taxes) and free movement (mass migration), with the result that Dublin is outwardly Irish – still beautiful – yet unaffordable and embroiled in a violent identity crisis.\n\nThese are economic policies that its elites justify as essential to modern nation building (“we need money, we need workers”), and it’s striking that the SNP has proposed doing similar things should Scotland gain independence. As Grant observed in 1965, the modern nation state can only develop by opening its arms to global capitalism, but global capitalism “entails the disappearance of those indigenous differences that give substance to nationalism.”\n\nIn short, American capital has made all of us rich, but it has also made us duplicates of the US. I’m convinced that many Britons are desperately unhappy, even mentally ill, because they don’t feel like themselves anymore.\n\nIt’s obvious in the way we now talk (badly) and emote (too often) but most apparent in our politics, which is imported and detached from our real history. Identity politics was Made in America: when federal agents shot and killed a protestor in Minnesota (murder in my book), Labour mayors felt obliged to write a letter of support for the Democrat mayor of Minneapolis. Why?\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, James Cleverly says his hero is Ronald Reagan, the Tories sell the good life in terms of Reaganite aspiration, and the infamous Jenrick memo, written to plot his defection to Reform, described him as the “new sheriff in town”. Its author spelt favourite without a “u”.\n\nThe party Rob joins has painted itself into a corner, having gambled its credentials on access to Trump and now forced to pretend there’s distance. Lo, even Brexit has been colonised. Outside of the European Union, said its Right-wing think-tankers, the only hope is a deal with America, a logic that even Keir Starmer has swallowed, pursuing regulatory alignment on the future of AI.\n\nOne suspects that for all Labour’s hatred of Elon Musk, it will never ban Twitter, because Trump will almost certainly apply sanctions.\n\nWe should not think of the President as un-American, as some embarrassed Americans call him, but the most American president ever, which is to say the ultimate liberal.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans, even if they disagree on practical policies, are both drawn from the philosophical tradition of liberalism, rooted in love of individual freedom, the unleashing of personal passion. Trump wants something, so he makes it happen. That’s what liberalism means, and it has infected us, too.\n\nIt’s why in the UK marriage and birth are out of style, pews are empty, and our top-rated TV show involves traitors killing faithfuls for cash (“she’s playing a blinder,” they say, as if human relations are a competitive sport).\n\nIf Britain is broken – and a country where the latest figures show 299,614 abortions a year, 40 for a cleft lip or palate, is definitely broken – it is because millions have chosen to maximise their freedom and wealth at the cost of social solidarity.\n\nThe Old Canada of John Diefenbaker, claimed Grant, was different because it combined the Tory paternalism of England with the ethics of French Catholicism, which said “virtue must be prior to freedom.” But these are gone, and Grant concluded that their demise was unavoidable because no nation can resist the power of America or the temptation of individualism.\n\nLiberalism ends, if not quite in world government, then in the whole world looking the same. What do the Japanese eat on Christmas Day? KFC.\n\nThis is why I watch the trade war for Greenland with distress and, I’m afraid, pessimism. Yes, Trump must be resisted. It is a question of dignity.\n\nBut until we Europeans wean ourselves off America, not just militarily or economically but psychologically, we really cannot function without it and will always surrender. It has dominated us for a long time; we’ve only noticed since the empire that pushed out investment suddenly started to suck it back in, a phenomenon that, again, is not unique to Trump. Joe Biden used subsidies and tax breaks to re-shore jobs in the US, away from the continent.\n\nThe irony is that alternative, more benign American political traditions do exist, but they’ve always been dismissed by Europeans as naive or dangerous because they wouldn’t bankroll our defence: libertarian among the Republicans, socialist among the Democrats. If only we’d had president Ron Paul or president Bernie Sanders. Greenland would go unmolested.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "When I left the Marines, it was not because I disliked the work. I had originally planned to serve 20 years and retire in uniform, but over time, new interests began pulling me in different directions.\n\nThe Marines are a 24-hour responsibility. Once you commit, your personal ambitions take a backseat. Eventually, I reached a point where I wanted to explore those ambitions — specifically, entrepreneurship — while I was still young enough to act on them.\n\nI made the decision to leave the service during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic — even though the civilian job market felt uncertain, and many encouraged me to stay.\n\nBut retired service members who had built businesses offered a different message. They helped me realize that the military equips people with more transferable skills than they often think. The transition resources on base reinforced that point, so I felt ready to move on.\n\nIn the Marines, I worked on amphibious operations and rotated through several roles. That variety helped me grow, but it also made choosing a civilian path harder.\n\nI had multiple strengths and enjoyed different aspects of my job, which meant I didn't leave with a single, defined plan. I had possibilities, but no fixed route.\n\nOnce I committed to transitioning, I wrote my goals down and worked toward them before my end date. Even with that preparation, the hardest part was simply starting. In the military, the steps are usually provided. In civilian life, you take every step on your own.\n\nI started to feel directionless, taking jobs in truck driving, sales, and real estate.\n\nI didn't realize how prepared I was until I stepped into civilian life. Public speaking, counseling skills, emotional discipline, and the habit of double-checking paperwork all became essential. Writing things down remained one of my strongest habits.\n\nThose small details sharpened my mind and made me more reliable. Clear communication and consistent structure helped me as I moved toward consulting and supporting clients.\n\nMy experience also helped me advance at key moments. One employer took a chance on me specifically because I had served in the military. Veterans continued to mentor me even when they could not offer opportunities. When I started consulting, I leaned heavily on my military experience, especially in developing structure and communication systems for clients.\n\nWorking multiple military jobs gave me broad experience, but entrepreneurship requires long-term focus. If you jump between strengths too quickly, you never grow one fully. I had to learn to slow myself down and commit to the task.\n\nThe cultural difference between military and civilian workplaces was larger than I expected. In the Marines, keeping everyone informed is a core rule. In civilian environments, information moves at different speeds. People communicate based on their roles, goals, or personal habits. Especially in smaller workplaces, communication can be inconsistent. I had to learn not to take those gaps personally.\n\nAccountability also functions differently. In the Marines, you trust that everyone is committed to the same mission. In civilian workplaces, people have different motivations. Some individuals seek career advancement, others desire stability, and others simply need a steady income. I struggled to adapt to that.\n\nThe military provided me with leadership experience, diverse skills, and a foundation that I still rely on. But I wish there had been stronger bridges between the military and civilian companies. Transitioning often felt like a jump when it should've felt like a path forward.\n\nLeaving the Marines did not mean starting over. It meant learning how to translate discipline, structure, and communication into a world that operates in a different way.\n\nThe biggest lesson was understanding that you cannot transition alone. You need civilians who can explain the environment you are entering and veterans who can share how they adapted.\n\nMy transition taught me that the qualities that made me effective in uniform still matter, but they must be applied with flexibility and adaptability. Civilian strategy requires patience, influence, effective communication, and a willingness to take the initiative and build your own steps.\n\nThe challenge is real, but so is the opportunity to rebuild with purpose.",

    "fullText": "Military veterans aged 65 face being mobilised under new powers to prepare the Armed Forces for war.\n\nThe Government is set to increase the age at which the nation’s pool of retired soldiers, known as the strategic reserve, can be called upon from 55 to 65.\n\nThe new measures are being introduced as part of a new Armed Forces bill, which will be published in Parliament later.\n\nThe changes will make it easier to mobilise tens of thousands of former military personnel.\n\nThe Army has shrunk to its smallest number in more than 200 years, with just over 70,000 full-time, fully-trained troops ready to deploy to the frontline.\n\nUnder existing rules, the pool of retired soldiers can be called upon in the event of “national danger, great emergency or attack in the UK”.\n\nHowever, under the new changes, this will be lowered to “warlike preparations”, which is already the threshold for reservists who have recently left the Armed Forces.\n\nThe measures come amid fears Britain could be dragged into a full-scale war with Russia in a matter of years.\n\nDefence and security chiefs have repeatedly warned of the potential for large-scale war in recent months.\n\nAl Carns, the Armed Forces minister, said just before Christmas that war was “already knocking on Europe’s door” and that Britain had to be prepared for a conflict that was “bigger” than those fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nLast week, the UK announced it would be deploying troops to Ukraine, alongside France, if and when a ceasefire deal between Moscow and Kyiv is agreed.\n\nWhile it is unclear exactly how many troops could be involved, reports have suggested up to 7,500 UK personnel could be deployed.\n\nIf this figure is accurate, it would effectively mean that around 21,000 personnel would be committed to Ukraine – with one cohort deployed, another in training and a third recovering for operations there.\n\nHowever, military analysts have warned such a deployment would stretch the Armed Forces and would effectively become an “all of Army effort” to maintain.\n\nSources at the Ministry of Defence have pushed back against suggestions that 7,500 troops could be deployed, with insiders saying it could be lower.\n\nOn Friday, the Government pledged to spend £200m to upgrade armoured vehicles and buy new kit in preparation for the peacekeeping mission.\n\nThe proposed changes would come into force next year if approved by Parliament, the BBC reported.\n\nThe Government estimates there are around 95,000 people within the strategic reserve, including veterans from the Royal Navy, Army, and RAF.\n\nThese are different to the reserve forces, which comprise personnel who volunteer part-time to serve in the military. Currently, there are almost 32,000 active reservists across the three wings of the Armed Forces.\n\nThe military has struggled to recruit and retain personnel in recent years. The Army has suffered the most, having shrunk from more than 100,000 personnel in 2010 to just over 70,000 now.\n\nThe most recent figures show a very marginal increase in the number of people joining the military. But it is still at its lowest ebb since the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nMeanwhile, the Armed Forces is grappling with a £28 billion funding black hole over the next four years despite plans to boost defence spending.\n\nSir Keir Starmer was warned about the shortfall by the head of the military, Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Knighton, a few days before Christmas.\n\nOn Monday, Sir Richard admitted Britain did not have the cash to deliver its military ambitions, which were set out by the PM in June as part of the Strategic Defence Review.\n\nThe Chief of the Defence Staff told MPs on the Commons defence committee: “I’ll be completely honest with you – we will not be able to do everything that we would wish to do as quickly as we might want to do it.\n\n“If we wanted to do everything that’s currently in the programme and do all the extra things in the SDR [strategic defence review], could we do that with the budget that we have got? The answer’s no.”\n\nThis is despite Sir Keir having announced last year that defence spending would rise from 2.3 per cent of GDP to 2.6 per cent by 2027. Looser pledges were also made in the strategic defence review to hit 3 per cent in the early 2030s and 3.5 per cent by 2035.\n\nAs part of the Strategic Defence Review, Sir Keir vowed to build 12 new nuclear attack submarines and spend billions more on new defence technology.\n\nBritain’s military spending is the subject of increasing criticism, with a parliamentary report last year warning the country was not ready to defend itself against attack.\n\nEarlier this month, the UK fell down the global defence spending rankings, and is now Nato’s 12th-biggest spender in terms of GDP compared with third in 2021.\n\nNews of the latest shortfall is said to have prompted Sir Keir to order a key MoD document, the defence investment plan, to be overhauled.\n\nThe Defence Investment Plan, which will set out how the Government’s long-term defence plans will be paid for, was originally due to be published in the autumn. However, it now appears to be stuck in financial purgatory, with Sir Richard telling MPs the MoD “do not have a date” for when it will be released.\n\nIt prompted concerns that the Armed Forces could soon be forced to make sweeping cuts to balance the books.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "Venezuela relied on Russian air defense systems and Chinese radars, but its forces did not shoot down any US military aircraft.",
    "fullText": "The US expected \"significant resistance\" from Venezuela's air defense systems during the nighttime raid to capture the country's former president, Nicolás Maduro, a newly released memo reveals.\n\nThe heavily redacted memorandum from the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel sheds new light on the Trump administration's planning efforts ahead of the early January military operation, including what opposition US forces might face from Venezuela's military and what that meant for the helicopters carrying special operators into downtown Caracas to grab Maduro and his wife.\n\n\"It is expected that US forces will face significant resistance on the approach,\" T. Elliot Gaiser, an assistant attorney general, wrote in the December 23 memo that was made public this week. \"There are as many as 75 anti-aircraft battery sites along the approach route to Fort Tiuna,\" Gaiser cited planning information provided by the Department of Defense.\n\nFort Tiuna, or Fuerte Tiuna, is a major military installation in the capital city, Caracas, that hosts defense ministries, critical commands, official residences, and other strategic infrastructure, and it is where Maduro was believed to be during the raid. The US heavily bombed the base, with satellite imagery showing widespread destruction at the site in the aftermath.\n\nThe DOJ memo also noted that Maduro's wife, Cilia Flores, would likely be present at the base. It said that she is \"known to be more aggressive and combative\" than her husband.\n\nMore than 150 US warplanes participated in the American operation, named Operation Absolute Resolve, including fighter jets, bombers, and drones. Some of these aircraft carried out strikes against Venezuelan military targets, including surface-to-air missile systems, to clear a path for low-flying helicopters carrying the forces that apprehended Maduro and his wife.\n\nThe DOJ memo hinted at additional threats and noted that Venezuela possessed unspecified, due to the heavy redactions, \"weapons\" that \"are capable of downing the helicopters carrying\" the assault forces. It's possible this is a reference to the Russian Igla man-portable air defense systems, shoulder-launched missiles designed to hit low-altitude targets, but it's unclear.\n\nMaduro said prior to the raid that Venezuela possessed thousands of Igla launchers.\n\nVenezuela relied heavily on Russian-made systems for its air defense network — such as S-300 batteries, Buk systems, and S-125 Pechora launchers — and Chinese radars. These weapon systems are believed to have been older export variants, though still capable; however, reporting indicates that systems might have been offline or in storage at the time of the attack.\n\nThough there had long been questions about the readiness of Venezuela's air defense network, Pentagon planners still considered it necessary to neutralize it. \"Before the assault force arrives at Fort Tiuna,\" the memo said, aircraft \"will serve as an escort and clear emplaced anti-aircraft batteries as needed.\"\n\n\"Risks to the mission are significant. Success will depend on surprise,\" the DOJ memo, which reviews the legality of the US raid, warned at the time.\n\nVenezuela's air defenses did not shoot down any US military aircraft during the raid; Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said shortly after the mission ended that the systems had been quickly dismantled by American forces.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth later said it \"seems those Russian air defenses didn't quite work so well, did they?\"\n\nThe newly released DOJ memo, which details how the US could present this as a law enforcement operation rather than an act of war, wrote that \"in addition to the targets for pre-assault fire,\" the Department of Defense \"has identified three airfields that may be destroyed should it appear that fighters are being assembled there to intercept the assault force.\"\n\n\"The airfields will not be struck otherwise as they are dual use for military and civilian purposes,\" the memo adds. It was written more than a week before the raid, so it's unclear whether US planning may have been tweaked in the days leading up to the mission.\n\nSatellite imagery revealed damage at the Higuerote Airport on Venezuela's northern coast, dozens of miles east of Caracas, after the raid. Photos from the tarmac showed a destroyed air defense system and a wrecked light aircraft.\n\nAlthough the US didn't appear to have faced the substantial resistance it expected, it still faced some during the raid. American forces stormed Maduro's compound under heavy fire, and at some point, a helicopter took a hit, reportedly by gunfire, but it remained flyable.\n\nA defense official said that seven US service members were wounded in the raid. \"The fact that this extremely complex and grueling mission was successfully executed with so few injuries is a testament to the expertise of our joint warriors,\" they added.\n\nVenezuela and Cuba said dozens of their security personnel were killed during the raid.",

    "description": "Greenland's natural resources and proximity to Russia and China have made it a valuable strategic asset to the US military since World War II.",
    "fullText": "Visitors to Pituffik Space Base in Greenland are greeted by a sign welcoming them to the \"top of the world.\"\n\nAs the US military's northernmost installation, Pituffik Space Base's operations include scientific research, space surveillance, and missile detection.\n\nGreenland's abundant natural resources and proximity to Russia and China have made it a valuable strategic asset since World War II — so much so that US President Donald Trump has often expressed his intent to purchase the autonomous Danish territory.\n\nVice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance visited the military base in March 2025 amid rising tensions between the US, Denmark, and Greenland.\n\nThose tensions have continued to flare as Trump has refused to rule out the use of military force to take control of Greenland. In a Truth Social post on Wednesday, Trump wrote that the US \"needs Greenland\" and \"anything less than that is unacceptable.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Denmark increased its military presence in Greenland, citing \"security tensions.\" Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio also met with the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland on Wednesday.\n\nHere's a look inside Greenland's only US military base.\n\nTrump first expressed interest in buying Greenland, the world's largest island and an autonomous Danish territory, during his first presidency. In addition to being rich in natural resources, Greenland's Arctic location is well-placed to further US interests by countering China and Russia.\n\nSince his reelection, Trump has repeatedly conveyed his desire to acquire Greenland and said he would not rule out the use of military force to take it.\n\n\"We need Greenland for national security. One way or the other we're going to get it,\" he said in his joint address to Congress in March 2025.\n\nBoth Denmark and Greenland's leaders have maintained that the island is not for sale.\n\nSecond lady Usha Vance was originally scheduled to visit Greenland on a solo trip in 2025 to \"visit historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersua, Greenland's national dogsled race,\" the White House said.\n\nInstead, the trip was scaled back. The vice president and second lady visited Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, the US military's northernmost installation, in March.\n\nUsha Vance's solo trip could have violated diplomatic protocol by sending a delegation to another country without an invitation. The amended plan — visiting a US base — avoided that potential violation. While Trump said that \"people from Greenland are asking us to go there,\" the government of Greenland said they had not invited any foreign delegations to visit.\n\n\"Just for the record, Naalakkersuisut, the government of Greenland, has not extended any invitations for any visits, neither private nor official,\" the government's official Facebook page wrote in a post on Monday.\n\nGreenland's then-prime minister, Múte Bourup Egede, also called Usha Vance's planned trip \"very aggressive\" in an interview with Sermitsiaq, a Greenlandic newspaper.\n\nTaylor Van Kirk, JD Vance's press secretary, told Business Insider at the time that the vice president and second lady were \"proud\" to visit the US military base in Greenland.\n\n\"As the vice president has said, previous US leaders have neglected Arctic security, while Greenland's Danish rulers have neglected their security obligations to the island. The security of Greenland is critical in ensuring the security of the rest of the world, and the Vice President looks forward to learning more about the island.\"\n\nWhile the US doesn't own Greenland, it has had a military presence there since World War II.\n\nPituffik Space Base, originally named Thule Air Base, was formally established in 1951 as part of a Cold War-era defense treaty between the US and Denmark. It is located in Pituffik, Greenland, 750 miles north of the Arctic Circle and halfway between New York and Moscow.\n\nAs a Danish territory, Greenland does not have a military of its own.\n\nAs the Pentagon's northernmost military base, Pituffik Space Base acts as a key Arctic defense outpost. Because of its location on the \"top of the world,\" it is an optimal vantage point for monitoring missile launches by US adversaries like Russia and establishing space superiority.\n\nThe base is the site of a phased-array radar, which can detect sea-launched and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and a surface-to-air missile system, which intercepts hostile threats.\n\nThe base has a Satellite Command and Control system to maintain real-time communications and data relay with military and intelligence satellites. Its high-altitude location also allows it to more frequently track polar-orbit satellites, which can monitor the entire Earth's surface over time as the planet rotates below them.\n\nBecause Pituffik's primary mission is space surveillance and missile warning, the space base doesn't house a permanently stationed fighter wing or naval fleet.\n\nInstead, it acts as a strategic logistics and defense hub for Arctic missions and under-ice operations. From the site, which is the world's northernmost deep-water seaport, surface vessels and submarines operated by the US Navy and allied forces conduct Arctic patrols and cold-weather training exercises.\n\nAircraft regularly fly in and out of the former air base, such as military cargo and refueling planes and maritime patrol aircraft. Occasionally, fighter jets and long-range bombers will fly to the base for Arctic deterrence deployments and training flights.\n\nWhile it doesn't have a permanent combat force, the Air Force does have one tugboat at Pituffik to support port operations, icebreaking, and maneuvering ships.\n\nA small but significant asset, the Rising Star helps keep supply routes open by breaking up and pushing floating ice. The tugboat guides supply ships through the port, making it a critical component in bringing fuel, food, and equipment to personnel year-round.\n\nHowever, since the base is locked in by ice for nine months of the year, the Rising Star gets limited use because it can only be operated when the port is completely ice-free.\n\nPituffik Space Base is surrounded by ice for nine months out of every year. The closest town, the Inuit village of Qaanaaq, is located 65 miles away.\n\nTemperatures can range from 60 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer, when there are 24 hours of daylight, to -50 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, when there is no sunlight for weeks.\n\nWinter storms are categorized into five levels from least to most severe: Normal, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, and Delta. At the Bravo level, the buddy system is implemented so that no one walks outside alone. Non-essential facilities close at the Charlie level, and personnel must shelter in place during Delta storms.\n\nAbout 150 personnel are stationed at Pituffik.\n\nThe Dundas Buffet Dining Hall on base serves three meals a day with payments accepted through a meal card.\n\nThe Base Exchange, also known as \"BX,\" sells groceries, toiletries, souvenirs, and other assorted goods. It also houses a barber shop.\n\nThere are no ATMs at Pituffik Space Base, but the Base Exchange accepts debit and credit cards as well as US dollars.\n\nPituffik Space Base features a bowling alley, a chapel, and a community center with a theater and craft room.\n\nThere's also a gymnasium and workout room stocked with weights and treadmills.\n\nPituffik Space Base's official Facebook page shows personnel participating in recreational events such as a Hawaiian-themed Arctic luau party, Greenlandic Heritage Week, and cross-country skiing.\n\nThe US built airbases and weather stations across the ice sheet during World War II as refueling stops on transatlantic flights and supply routes.\n\nTwo decommissioned airbases are now being used as civilian airports, and a third was abandoned after the war ended.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the US Air Force also built four stations on Greenland's coasts as part of a larger communication network of more than 60 radar installations to detect Soviet bombers. Most of the stations have since been deactivated, left to deteriorate atop Greenland's ice sheet.\n\nIn 2024, NASA scientists detected an underground base for a top-secret Cold War-era missile operation known as Camp Century. Now buried 100 feet under the ice, the abandoned network of subterranean tunnels once operated under the guise of an Arctic research facility before the US government declassified it in 1995.\n\nBut the abandoned military sites represent more than just relics of past global conflicts. Thousands of gallons of biological, chemical, and radioactive waste left behind on the bases pose a significant environmental threat, especially as the planet warms.\n\nThe US military failed to clean up decommissioned facilities like Camp Century, assuming the ice sheet would entomb the waste and infrastructure over the years.\n\nHowever, at the current melting rate of the Arctic, researchers estimate that the waste could resurface around 2100. The question remains as to who is responsible for cleaning up the waste from abandoned US military facilities scattered throughout Greenland.\n\nThe US has long pursued access to or control over Greenland due to its strategic and economic significance, dating back as early as the late 19th century.\n\nSince his return to the White House, Trump has continued to double down on his ambitions to secure the self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, saying he won't rule out military force or economic coercion to do so.\n\nThough the Danish government has remained steadfast in refusing the sale, Trump's so-called \"real estate deal\" has spotlighted Greenland's growing desire for independence from Denmark and disinterest in being owned by anybody, including the US.\n\n\"The time has come to stand together,\" Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said at a press conference on Tuesday, appearing with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. \"It has not been easy to stand up to completely unacceptable pressure from our closest allies for a lifetime. But there is much to suggest that the hardest part is still ahead of us.\"",

    "fullText": "US planning for the high-risk raid to apprehend Venezuela's former president, Nicolás Maduro, centered on a time when much of the country's military would be on holiday leave, a newly released memo reveals.\n\nThe December 23 memorandum from the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel offers fresh details about how the US planned to pull off the daring nighttime raid to capture Maduro in his fortified compound and transport him to New York to stand trial. The former leader has pleaded not guilty to the drug and weapons charges he faces.\n\nThe raid began late on January 2 and ran into the next day. President Donald Trump said on January 3 that the initial plan was for the operation to occur four days earlier, on December 30, but he decided to wait for better weather.\n\n\"The expected duration of the operation within Venezuelan territory is [redacted] hours,\" wrote T. Elliot Gaiser, a US assistant attorney general, wrote in the late December DOJ memo, which looks into the legality of the raid and was made public this week. Much of the planning section is blacked out.\n\n\"In order to minimize casualties, the strike will take place at 0100 am (local time) on a date where a maximum number of Venezuelan military would be on leave for the holidays,\" Gaiser wrote.\n\nIt's unclear how many soldiers were away when the US actually executed the operation in January. Dozens of Venezuelan and Cuban security personnel were killed, the two countries said after Operation Absolute Resolve concluded.\n\nThe DOJ memo, which cited Pentagon planning information and details how the US could effectively present the action as a law enforcement operation rather than an act of war, said that the US expected to encounter \"significant resistance\" from Venezuela's air defenses.\n\nThat anticipated resistance includes several dozen anti-aircraft systems on the approach to Fuerte Tiuna, a major military installation in Caracas where Maduro and his wife were believed to be and, indeed, were at the time of the operation.\n\nThe memo outlined how US aircraft would strike air defense systems to clear a path for assault forces to reach Tiuna. It said that the Pentagon aimed to target a local power switching station to keep the power off, which could explain Trump's post-raid remarks that a \"certain expertise\" was used to turn off the lights in Caracas.\n\nThe US could have also carried out a cyberattack or employed electronic warfare capabilities. \"Kinetic operations will be preceded by non-kinetic action,\" the memo said.\n\nThe memo was published several days before the raid, so it's unclear how US planning may have changed between the time it was written and the actual operation.\n\nDan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on January 3 after the raid that more than 150 US aircraft participated in the operation, including stealth jets, electronic attack aircraft, surveillance and reconnaissance planes, airborne early warning aircraft, bombers, and drones.\n\nMany of these aircraft targeted and engaged Venezuela's air defenses to clear a path for low-flying helicopters carrying the forces that stormed Maduro's compound and apprehended the former president and his wife, consistent with the planning memo.\n\nThe US didn't lose any aircraft during the raid. A helicopter took a hit but still remained operational, and a defense official said seven American service members were wounded during the night.\n\n\"Risks to the mission are significant,\" the memo said, adding that its \"success will depend on surprise.\" In the aftermath, Caine said the US achieved \"totally the element of surprise.\"",

    "description": "Hegseth's effort to punish a US senator \"places other retirees who have spoken up potentially in jeopardy,\" a military law expert said.",
    "fullText": "A new lawsuit from a Democratic senator and combat veteran at the heart of a free speech fight seeks to block the Pentagon's intensifying crackdown.\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly sued Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday, warning that the Pentagon's effort to punish him \"sends a chilling message\" to veterans who speak out against the Trump administration. \n\nHegseth accused Kelly of \"seditious\" acts after Kelly publicly reminded US service members that they are not required to follow illegal orders. The Pentagon's actions against Kelly have troubling implications for the political speech of millions of veterans, military law experts said.\n\nHegseth's effort to muzzle a US senator \"places other retirees who have spoken up potentially in jeopardy,\" said Rachel VanLandingham, a professor at Southwestern Law School who is a retired Air Force JAG. \"Not knowing whether or not he's going to come after you already has a chilling effect.\"\n\nKelly said his lawsuit is about fighting back. The Democratic lawmaker announced the federal lawsuit on Monday. His suit also named the Department of Defense, Navy Secretary John Phelan, and the Navy Department as defendants. Kelly's video urging troops not to follow illegal orders.\n\nVeterans who serve 20 years or more are eligible for a military pension, but those benefits can be revoked or reduced if retirees are found to have violated military law while in uniform. By contrast, Hegseth's move seeks to punish a veteran for his speech long after serving in uniform, an approach one expert on military law called baseless.\n\nKelly's lawsuit argues that using the military justice system to punish veterans' political speech risks setting a precedent that abuses the First Amendment rights of other retired troops.\n\nThe lawsuit argues that nothing in the law allows the Pentagon to revisit a retirement determination based on a veteran's speech. Such a move, the filing says, would raise \"serious constitutional concerns\" and leave retired service members facing a constant threat to their earned benefits.\n\nThere's no legal basis for Hegseth's pursuit, VanLandingham said. The defense secretary initially sought to court-martial Kelly, threatening him with the military equivalent of a criminal trial. It later opted for a lesser administrative punishment.\n\n\"The process is the punishment,\" said Frank Rosenblatt, a retired Army JAG and professor at Mississippi College School of Law. \"The claim against Kelly had no merit.\"\n\n\"Senator Kelly's speech is not punishable under the UCMJ,\" the National Institute of Military Justice nonprofit group said in a December statement in reference to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to halt actions that could reduce Kelly's military rank and retirement pay and characterizes that effort as \"unlawful.\"\n\nAfter filing the lawsuit, Kelly requested a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction from the federal court, seeking to halt the Pentagon's actions while the case is reviewed on its merits. Both are emergency measures that ask a judge to stop government action before permanent harm occurs.\n\nThe federal government has been increasingly pushing cases important to the Trump administration onto a \"rocket docket,\" Rosenblatt said, accelerating litigation toward higher courts. If the judge assigned to the case, US District Judge Richard Leon, issues a ruling the government doesn't like, \"this could move very quickly to the DC Circuit and potentially the Supreme Court.\"\n\nLeon has previously ruled against the military's authority over retirees.\n\n\"I am not concluding today that Congress could never authorize the court-martial of some military retirees,\" Leon wrote in a 2019 memorandum opinion that rejected the government's argument that military jurisdiction over all retirees was necessary to maintain good order and discipline of its active force. The judge noted he had not seen a clear argument for \"why the exercise of such jurisdiction over all military retirees is necessary.\"\n\nIn a post on X last week, Hegseth called Kelly's video with five other Democratic lawmakers \"reckless and seditious\" and said it was \"clearly intended to undermine good order and military discipline.\"\n\nThe military justice provisions that Hegseth accused Kelly of violating — Articles 133 and 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice — are not explicitly tied to sedition and can cover a wide range of alleged misconduct.\n\nKelly's lawsuit argues that allowing the executive branch to punish a member of Congress for speech is a threat to the Constitution and erodes congressional oversight of the armed services.\n\n\"We are aware of the litigation,\" a Pentagon spokesperson said Tuesday when asked for comment on the lawsuit. \"However, as a matter of policy, the Department does not comment on ongoing litigation.\" That same day, Hegseth took aim at Kelly's military rank in an X post: \"'Captain' Kelly knows exactly what he did, and that he will be held to account.\"",

    "title": "2 military influencers say they never planned to have an online following, but standard recruiting efforts weren't working",
    "description": "Military influencers, Tyler Butterworth and John Howell, explain how they grew a following and the key change that made their content take off.",
    "fullText": "Tyler Butterworth's only dedicated follower on social media used to be his mom. The Army National Guard sergeant first class said his entire social media footprint amounted to a Facebook account where he occasionally posted photos of his dog. His mom liked them. That was it.\n\nAbout three years later, Butterworth has over 6 million combined followers across Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube. \"I used social media as a tool to assist me with recruiting,\" he told Business Insider's Jake Gabbard during a visit to Fort Knox in July, shown in the video below. \"It worked very well at getting the information out there.\"\n\nJohn Howell, a major in the Washington Army National Guard, tells a similar story. During his time at a command village in a rural part of Washington, he was tasked with growing the base from 50 soldiers to 132 soldiers, he said.\n\nLike Butterworth, Howell took to social media for help. While his following is much smaller than Butterworth's, Howell said the effort paid off. By the time he left the command village, he'd helped grow it to \"triple digits,\" he said.\n\nButterworth and Howell — who don't officially work as recruiters for the Army but continue to post on their personal social media accounts to influence potential enlistees — are part of a growing trend. Recruiters across the military have said that traditional methods, such as phone calls and school visits, are increasingly ineffective, as fewer teenagers are eligible or interested in service, and as young people spend more of their time online, leaving recruiters searching for new ways to reach potential enlistees.\n\nDespite the shift, certain branches, including the Army and Navy, exceeded recruiting goals in 2025. Military influencers like Butterworth and Howell are part of the new equation, and so are programs like the Army's Future Soldier Preparatory Course, which helps interested applicants improve academically or physically to qualify for Basic Training.\n\nStill, Business Insider's Kelsey Baker has found that pressure to meet quotas led to burnout concerns for Army recruiters in the past. More recently, Baker reported that those strains, combined with a shrinking recruiting pool, have left many Marine Corps recruiters overworked and burned out.\n\nButterworth and Howell didn't mention feeling overworked due to recruiting quotas. Growing followers on social media, though, didn't come easy to either of them.\n\n\"My first content was not cool at all,\" Howell said. It was a lot of workout videos that weren't reaching anyone. Butterworth added that he didn't see \"instant success,\" either, and tried many different approaches. What flipped the page for both of them was a shift away from the strong, tough, fearless tone typically associated with the military.\n\n\"I think it's important to show that while we are lethal and we can maneuver and do all these things in the Army, we're also regular people,\" Butterworth said. \"We like to laugh. We like to joke around.\"\n\nButterworth found his groove after he started uploading humorous content to show the human, everyday side of Army life. \"I want to show soldiers in a positive light and not necessarily super serious all the time,\" he said.\n\nAfter advice from Butterworth, Howell said he started making humorous videos, too, and saw a noticeable difference. \"I really picked up after that, and it seemed to work better with the recruiting effort after we started using humor,\" Howell said.\n\nThe military's increased use of social media has raised legal and ethical questions, including how troops in uniform should operate online and where the line falls between personal content and official messaging.\n\nIndeed, Butterworth was one of eight influencers the Army wanted to formalize a partnership with, but legal concerns, such as monetization, crushed the effort, Baker reported.\n\nBoth Butterworth and Howell said that their social media use stays within Army guidelines. Butterworth, for example, said he avoids direct calls to action on platforms like TikTok, and Howell said he adjusted how and when he posted — including limiting when he appeared in uniform — to comply with policy.\n\nIn addition to legal concerns, there's a growing debate about whether military influencers create inequities within the force. Baker has found that while some troops see recruiting value in the influencers, others are frustrated by what they view as an imbalance between influencer activities and traditional military duties, and say opportunities to profit from social media, such as consulting gigs, overshadow their actual recruiting value.\n\nNeither framed social media as a replacement for recruiting work, but rather as a way to meet people where they already were. Howell said recognition from social media often meant potential recruits already knew something about him before meeting in person, giving him what he called \"a foot in the door.\"\n\nButterworth added he doesn't view what he does online as a job or a personal brand. \"I'm not here for myself,\" he said. \"I'm here for the soldiers.\"",

    "description": "Military veterans aged 65 face being mobilised under new powers to prepare the Armed Forces for war.",
    "fullText": "Military veterans aged 65 face being mobilised under new powers to prepare the Armed Forces for war.\n\nThe Government is set to increase the age at which the nation’s pool of retired soldiers, known as the strategic reserve, can be called upon from 55 to 65.\n\nThe new measures are being introduced as part of a new Armed Forces bill, which will be published in Parliament later.\n\nThe changes will make it easier to mobilise tens of thousands of former military personnel.\n\nThe Army has shrunk to its smallest number in more than 200 years, with just over 70,000 full-time, fully-trained troops ready to deploy to the frontline.\n\nUnder existing rules, the pool of retired soldiers can be called upon in the event of “national danger, great emergency or attack in the UK”.\n\nHowever, under the new changes, this will be lowered to “warlike preparations”, which is already the threshold for reservists who have recently left the Armed Forces.\n\nThe measures come amid fears Britain could be dragged into a full-scale war with Russia in a matter of years.\n\nDefence and security chiefs have repeatedly warned of the potential for large-scale war in recent months.\n\nAl Carns, the Armed Forces minister, said just before Christmas that war was “already knocking on Europe’s door” and that Britain had to be prepared for a conflict that was “bigger” than those fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nLast week, the UK announced it would be deploying troops to Ukraine, alongside France, if and when a ceasefire deal between Moscow and Kyiv is agreed.\n\nWhile it is unclear exactly how many troops could be involved, reports have suggested up to 7,500 UK personnel could be deployed.\n\nIf this figure is accurate, it would effectively mean that around 21,000 personnel would be committed to Ukraine – with one cohort deployed, another in training and a third recovering for operations there.\n\nHowever, military analysts have warned such a deployment would stretch the Armed Forces and would effectively become an “all of Army effort” to maintain.\n\nSources at the Ministry of Defence have pushed back against suggestions that 7,500 troops could be deployed, with insiders saying it could be lower.\n\nOn Friday, the Government pledged to spend £200m to upgrade armoured vehicles and buy new kit in preparation for the peacekeeping mission.\n\nThe proposed changes would come into force next year if approved by Parliament, the BBC reported.\n\nThe Government estimates there are around 95,000 people within the strategic reserve, including veterans from the Royal Navy, Army, and RAF.\n\nThese are different to the reserve forces, which comprise personnel who volunteer part-time to serve in the military. Currently, there are almost 32,000 activist reservists across the three wings of the Armed Forces.\n\nThe military has struggled to recruit and retain personnel in recent years. The Army has suffered the most, having shrunk from more than 100,000 personnel in 2010 to just over 70,000 now.\n\nThe most recent figures show a very marginal increase in the number of people joining the military. But it is still at its lowest ebb since the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nMeanwhile, the Armed Forces is grappling with a £28 billion funding black hole over the next four years despite plans to boost defence spending.\n\nSir Keir Starmer was warned about the shortfall by the head of the military, Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Knighton, a few days before Christmas.\n\nOn Monday, Sir Richard admitted Britain did not have the cash to deliver its military ambitions, which were set out by the PM in June as part of the Strategic Defence Review.\n\nThe Chief of the Defence Staff told MPs on the Commons defence committee: “I’ll be completely honest with you – we will not be able to do everything that we would wish to do as quickly as we might want to do it.\n\n“If we wanted to do everything that’s currently in the programme and do all the extra things in the SDR [strategic defence review], could we do that with the budget that we have got? The answer’s no.”\n\nThis is despite Sir Keir having announced last year that defence spending would rise from 2.3 per cent of GDP to 2.6 per cent by 2027. Looser pledges were also made in the strategic defence review to hit 3 per cent in the early 2030s and 3.5 per cent by 2035.\n\nAs part of the Strategic Defence Review, Sir Keir vowed to build 12 new nuclear attack submarines and spend billions more on new defence technology.\n\nBritain’s military spending is the subject of increasing criticism, with a parliamentary report last year warning the country was not ready to defend itself against attack.\n\nEarlier this month, the UK fell down the global defence spending rankings, and is now Nato’s 12th-biggest spender in terms of GDP compared with third in 2021.\n\nNews of the latest shortfall is said to have prompted Sir Keir to order a key MoD document, the defence investment plan, to be overhauled.\n\nThe Defence Investment Plan, which will set out how the Government’s long-term defence plans will be paid for, was originally due to be published in the autumn. However, it now appears to be stuck in financial purgatory, with Sir Richard telling MPs the MoD “do not have a date” for when it will be released.\n\nIt prompted concerns that the Armed Forces could soon be forced to make sweeping cuts to balance the books.",

    "description": "In his remarks at Ukraine's parliament, Mykhailo Fedorov warned of nearly 2 million Ukrainians dodging the military draft.",
    "fullText": "Around 2 million Ukrainians are dodging military drafts, while another 200,000 are absent without official leave, or AWOL, Kyiv's newly appointed defense minister said on Wednesday.\n\nThe tally revealed by Mykhailo Fedorov is a rare disclosure by the Ukrainian leadership about the troop shortages the country has grappled with throughout the war.\n\nFedorov, who was previously minister of digital transformation, was speaking in Ukraine's parliament as representatives confirmed his new appointment in the defense role.\n\nThe defense minister said roughly 2 million Ukrainians are \"wanted\" for evading callups, with another 200,000 soldiers voluntarily leaving their posts without permission to do so.\n\nFedorov has pledged wide reform, saying he would audit Ukraine's military and root out systemic issues \"that have accumulated over the years\" in training and command.\n\n\"We cannot fight with new technologies under an old organizational structure,\" Fedorov said.\n\nUnder martial law in Ukraine, going AWOL is defined as being away without permission for more than three days, an act that can carry a prison sentence of between five to 10 years. Desertion is when a soldier is deemed to be intentionally avoiding service and carries a more severe sentence of up to 12 years in prison.\n\nA soldier could go AWOL if they are given a break from the fighting or leave to return home, then fail to show up when ordered to do so. Sometimes, troops simply flee their positions.\n\nThe figures relayed by Fedorov may be affected by a notorious tactic among Ukrainian troops seeking to transfer to another unit, especially if they were previously denied. Some soldiers try to circumvent the official process by going AWOL and then reporting for duty again with a recommendation for their desired unit.\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general's office told local media outlet Ukrainska Pravda last year that, from the start of the war to September 2025, it had opened over 235,000 criminal cases for AWOL-related offenses, as well as over 53,000 for desertion.\n\nAs a loose comparison, some records say that a rough total of 150,000 American and British troops deserted or went AWOL during World War II across the entire European theater.\n\nAnother key concern implied in Fedorov's speech is the sheer scale of missing recruits that Kyiv desperately needs.\n\nThe country is already straining against Russia's much larger war economy and military industrial complex, and one of its most pressing needs is to replenish its fighters on the front lines.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that his country fields around 880,000 active-duty personnel, though other estimates vary.\n\nThe lack of reinforcements is crushing both for Ukrainian morale and operational success. Without reinforcements, some Ukrainian units have reported holding frontline positions for years with barely any rest or opportunity to rotate out to see their families.\n\nIn the city of Pokrovsk, for example, Zelenskyy said that Kyiv's troops were outnumbered 1 to 8 in the fall, when Russia aggressively tried to take control of the devastated regional hub via repeated ground assaults.\n\nUkrainian men aged 25 to 60 are eligible to be called up for active duty, though those as young as 18 must register with the military. Thousands of Ukrainian men have fled overseas since the war started. Many have done so illegally; Ukraine doesn't allow men aged 23 to 60 to leave its borders.\n\nFedorov said a key focus of his audit would be to assess what Ukraine can do more efficiently with the troops it has now. One of these reform goals is to ensure basic-level staffing in all of Ukraine's drone brigades, which he said is now \"definitely lacking.\"\n\n\"Today, the top 50 out of 400 total units involved in drones provide 70% of enemy damage,\" he said. \"Imagine the potential of the defense forces if we help the remaining 350 grow.\"\n\nThe defense minister, who is 35, also said the Ukrainian military is starting the year with considerably fewer resources. Its budget for 2026 is roughly 300 billion Ukrainian hryvnias, or $7 billion, lower than that for 2025, Fedorov said.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — More than a year before an American military operation deposed Nicolás Maduro, a senior aide to President Donald Trump argued that the Venezuelan leader had been dispatching gang members into the United States.\n\n\"If you’re a dictator of a poor country with a high crime rate, wouldn’t you send your criminals to our open border?” Stephen Miller told reporters in the closing stretch of Trump's 2024 comeback campaign.\n\nMiller now serves as the White House chief of staff for policy, where he plays a prominent role in promoting Trump's policy agenda. His bombastic style and zero-sum worldview have made him a lightning rod within the administration. Critics argue that Miller’s rhetoric about foreign nations and immigrants echoes racist and imperialist ideas that have undergirded military actions by the U.S. and other nations for centuries.\n\nA joint statement from the governments of Spain and five Latin American countries following the Venezuela operation called for countries in the region to engage in “mutual respect, the peaceful settlement of disputes, and nonintervention,” while Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called the administration's Venezuela policy “old-fashioned imperialism.”\n\n“Advocating for policies that put American citizens first isn’t racist. Anyone who says so is either intentionally lying or just plain stupid,” said White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson.\n\nHere's a look at how Miller laid the rhetorical groundwork for this month's attack on Venezuela and what his comments say about the administration's broader worldview.\n\nMiller argues that Western nations’ aid to developing world was ‘reverse colonization’\n\nShortly after the U.S. operation that captured Maduro, Miller wrote on social media: “Not long after World War II the West dissolved its empires and colonies and began sending colossal sums of taxpayer-funded aid to these former territories (despite have already made them far wealthier and more successful). The West opened its borders, a kind of reverse colonization, providing welfare and thus remittances, while extending to these newcomers and their families not only the full franchise but preferential legal and financial treatment over the native citizenry. The neoliberal experiment, at its core, has been a long self-punishment of the places and peoples that built the modern world.\"\n\nMiller argues that Venezuelan oil was stolen from US oil industry\n\nTwo weeks before Maduro's arrest, Miller in December echoed arguments by Trump that the Venezuelan oil industry was stolen from American oil companies:\n\n“American sweat, ingenuity and toil created the oil industry in Venezuela. Its tyrannical expropriation was the largest recorded theft of American wealth and property. These pillaged assets were then used to fund terrorism and flood our streets with killers, mercenaries and drugs,” Miller wrote on social media.\n\nMiller says Venezuelan government is in service to US\n\nMiller in January claimed to reporters that U.S. military power had ensured compliance from the Caracas government.\n\n“We have an oil embargo in Venezuela for them to do any kind of commerce. They need our permission. We have our massive fleet or armada still present there. This is an active and ongoing U.S. government military operation, and so, of course, we set the terms and conditions,\" Miller said.\n\nHe added: “Our conversations are that we are very much getting full, complete and total cooperation from the government of Venezuela, and as a result of that cooperation, the people of Venezuela are going to become richer than they ever have before. And of course, the United States is going to benefit from this massively in terms of economic, security and military cooperation, counter-narcotics, counterterrorism and every other dimension of our security.\"\n\nMiller calls for a world order based on strength, says US military occupation of Greenland would not be opposed\n\nDuring a wide-ranging January interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Miller repeatedly argued for the primacy of American power and criticized the international order the U.S. once led.\n\n“You can talk all you want about international niceties and everything else. But we live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world,\" said Miller.\n\nMiller also dismissed concerns that Trump's vows to take Greenland from Denmark, a fellow member of the NATO military alliance, may trigger a military conflict with Europe.\n\n“Nobody’s going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland,\" said Miller.\n\nMiller argues that Western nations engaged in ‘groveling’ to former colonies\n\nIn the same interview, Miller said it would be “absurd and preposterous” and “not even a serious question” to propose the administration support Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado's bid to lead the country because the military would not back her.\n\nTapper then asked whether the South American country should hold elections.\n\nMiller replied: “The United States is using its military to secure our interests unapologetically in our hemisphere. We’re a superpower, and under President Trump, we are going to conduct ourselves as a superpower. It is absurd that we would allow a nation in our own backyard to become the supplier of resources to our adversaries, but not to us, to hoard weapons from our adversaries, to be able to be positioned as an asset against the United States, rather than on behalf of the United States.”\n\nThe anchor pressed Miller on whether sovereign countries had the right to conduct their own affairs.\n\nMiller explained the administration’s stance: “The Monroe Doctrine and the Trump Doctrine is all about securing the national interest of America. For years, we sent our soldiers to die in deserts in the Middle East to try to build them parliaments, to try to build them democracies, to try to give them more oil, try to give them more resources. The future of the free world, Jake, depends on America being able to assert ourselves and our interests without apology.\" He called for an end to \"This whole period that happened after World War II, where the West began apologizing and groveling and engaging in these massive reparations schemes.”\n\nHe also defended the administration's operation and echoed his past claims that Maduro had sent criminals into the U.S.: “We’re not going to let tinpot communist dictators send rapists into our country, send drugs into our country, send weapons into our country.\"\n\nMiller criticizes anti-ICE protests following immigration crackdown in Minneapolis\n\nMiller has returned to promoting the administration's stance on domestic issues like immigration and partisan politics.\n\nOn Tuesday, following nationwide protests after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman in Minnesota, Miller wrote on social media: “Americans voting overwhelmingly for mass deportation. Congress passed laws requiring it and then passed new legislation to fully fund it. The response of the Democrat Party and its activists has been to support and orchestrate violent resistance against federal law enforcement.”\n\nHe later added in a separate post, “In case it isn’t clear by now, if Democrats won they would have made every city into Mogadishu or Kabul or Port-au-Prince.\"",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Wide-scale desertions and 2 million draft-dodgers are among a raft of challenges facing Ukraine's military as Russia presses on with its invasion of its neighbor after almost four years of fighting, the new defense minister said Wednesday.\n\nMykhailo Fedorov told Ukraine's parliament that other problems facing Ukraine’s armed forces include excessive bureaucracy, a Soviet-style approach to management, and disruptions in the supply of equipment to troops along the about 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line.\n\n“We cannot fight a war with new technologies but an old organizational structure,” Fedorov said.\n\nHe said the military had faced some 200,000 troop desertions and draft-dodging by around 2 million people.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy appointed 34-year-old Fedorov at the start of the year. The former head of Ukraine’s digital transformation policies is credited with spearheading the the army's drone technology and introducing several successful e-government platforms.\n\nHis appointment was part of a broad government reshuffle that the Ukrainian leader said aimed to sharpen the focus on security, defense development and diplomacy amid a new U.S.-led push to find a peace settlement.\n\nFedorov said the defense ministry is facing a shortfall of 300 billion hryvnia ($6.9 billion) in funding needs.\n\nThe European Union will dedicate most of a massive new loan program to help fund Ukraine’s military and economy over the next two years, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday.\n\nFedorov said Ukraine’s defense sector has expanded significantly since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. At the start of the war, he said, the country had seven private drone companies and two firms developing electronic warfare systems. Today, he said, there are nearly 500 drone manufacturers and about 200 electronic warfare companies in Ukraine.\n\nHe added that some sectors have emerged from scratch, including private missile producers, which now number about 20, and more than 100 companies manufacturing ground-based robotic systems.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "title": "Most Bizarre Military Vehicles That Made History",
    "description": "Military history is full of bizarre engineering born of desperation. These \"fever dream\" machines challenged physics to solve the impossible problems of war.",
    "fullText": "Military history is filled with sleek fighters, massive tanks, and iconic weapons, but scattered among them are machines so bizarre they look like they were designed during a fever dream after binge-watching too many sci-fi movies. Some were prototypes that never made it past testing but still flew, rolled, or fired in real life, proving that just because you can build something doesn't mean you should.\n\nOthers were actually put into full service, where their strange shapes and awkward designs became unlikely heroes of war. These weren't the most polished, but rather eccentric solutions born of necessity, wild ambition, or the kind of desperation that makes you think \"what if we just duct-tape a howitzer to this truck chassis?\"\n\nFrom tanks that resembled mobile barns to flying boats that seemed half-alien, each one demonstrates how engineers sometimes disregard physics textbooks to see what happens.\n\nWe didn’t simply pick vehicles that looked odd (although that's quite fascinating in its own right). Our ranking was based on three factors:\n\nHow unusual their concept or design was\n\nWhether they worked in practice\n\nTo capture the full spectrum of strangeness, we split the list into two parts. The first half covers vehicles that were experimental or never saw true combat, but were still real machines that left the drawing board and proved themselves in tests. The second half highlights the bizarre vehicles that actually went into service or saw combat, showing that weirdness didn’t stop at the prototype stage.\n\nOur goal wasn’t to judge them on technical specs or battlefield performance, but on how boldly and bizarrely they challenged conventional design. In the end, each machine earned its spot by being both strange and real, either as a functioning oddity or as a combat-tested curiosity.\n\nNot every wild idea made it to the battlefield, but that didn't stop engineers from building and testing them anyway. These machines were strange, ambitious, and often about as practical as a screen door on a submarine; yet they were real, and they proved that even the craziest concepts could take shape in steel and wings.\n\nSpecs: 183 mm L4A1 gun, Centurion-based chassis, about 50.8 tonnes combat weight; very tall, lightly armored turret\n\nAt first glance, the FV4005 Stage II looked like someone had welded a garden shed onto a tank chassis and declared it battle-ready. This wasn't subtle engineering: this was the British saying, \"if bigger guns win wars, let's build the biggest bloody gun we can fit on tracks.\"\n\nThe turret was so absurdly tall and thin that crews nicknamed it \"The Barn,\" and honestly, most barns probably had better structural integrity. The tank was so top-heavy that firing the main gun required lowering a rear recoil spade into the ground, essentially turning it into a temporary artillery piece.In trials, recoil could noticeably lift the front of the vehicle (reported on the order of a few dozen centimeters at some elevations); which is either impressive engineering or a fantastic way to launch your tank crew into orbit. Maybe both.\n\nThe 183mm gun could theoretically penetrate any Soviet armor at ridiculous ranges, but good luck getting there without tipping over. Tank crews took one look at this mechanical giraffe and probably started updating their wills. Though it never entered service, it remains a favorite among tank enthusiasts who appreciate the pure audacity of strapping a ship's cannon to a tank and hoping for the best.\n\nSpecs: Allison YT40-A-14 turboprop, 5,850 hp, a tailsitter VTOL concept (intended to take off and land vertically, but it never demonstrated operational vertical takeoffs/landings in testing), maximum pucker factor\n\nThe Lockheed XFV was probably the result of someone asking, \"What if we made a plane that lands like a rocket?\" and nobody had the sense to say, \"That sounds terrible.\" This tail-sitting fighter looked like a conventional plane that had been stood on its tail by a very confused ground crew.\n\nThe idea was brilliant in theory: vertical takeoff meant no runways were needed, making it perfect for carriers or forward bases. In practice, it meant asking test pilots to land while looking over their shoulder at the ground rushing up to meet them. The landing gear looked like something stolen from a NASA launch pad, because conventional gear would have snapped like toothpicks.\n\nTest pilot Herman \"Fish\" Salmon (yes, that was his real name) described flying it as \"interesting,\" which in test pilot speak translates to \"holy heck, I can't believe I survived that.\" The XFV flew conventionally using temporary landing gear and conducted limited testing related to the VTOL concept, but it did not prove routine vertical takeoff-and-landing operations, and likely give any pilot who flew it nightmares for weeks.\n\nThe program was scrapped when everyone realized that asking pilots to thread the needle of a vertical landing while enemy fire was incoming might not be the best career move. The XFV proved that sometimes the laws of physics and human psychology should take precedence over engineering ambition.\n\nSpecs: Two Soloviev D-30 turbofans, inflatable pontoons, maximum weirdness coefficient achieved\n\nThe VVA-14 looked like what you'd get if a submarine, a seaplane, and a hovercraft had a three-way collision and decided to make the best of it. Soviet engineers were tasked with building an anti-submarine aircraft that could operate from water, and apparently decided that conventional design principles were for capitalists.\n\nThis flying doorstop featured inflatable pontoons that resembled giant water wings, stubby wings that seemed too small to keep a paper airplane aloft, and a fuselage that appeared to have been designed with a ruler and little imagination. The whole thing looked as if it were perpetually surprised to be airborne.\n\nThe VVA-14 was supposed to hunt NATO submarines using ground effect, basically flying so close to the water that it could barely clear the waves. Watching it take off was like seeing a concrete mixer attempt flight. Soviet test crews reported it handled \"adequately,\" which is probably the most damning praise ever recorded in aviation history.\n\nDespite looking like a flying mistake, it actually worked. The program stalled largely because the intended lift-engine set (for VTOL/ground-effect ambitions) was never delivered, and after Bartini’s death the project lost momentum. The VVA-14 remains proof that Soviet engineers could make literally anything fly if they were given enough vodka and state funding.\n\nSpecs: Standard Meteor F8 airframe, pilot lying face-down, ergonomics designed by sadists\n\nSomeone at Gloster Aircraft looked at the perfectly functional Meteor fighter and thought, \"You know what this needs? The pilot should be lying on their stomach like they're getting a massage.\" The theory was that prone positioning would help pilots better handle high G-forces. The reality was more like asking fighter pilots to dogfight while planking.\n\nThe modified cockpit looked like a medieval torture device with windows. Test pilots had to operate all controls while lying flat, which meant reaching forward for everything and craning their necks to see where they were going. Photos of the test setup resemble someone trying to cram a grown man into a torpedo tube.\n\nRAF test pilot Eric George Franklin flew the prone-pilot Meteor during evaluation flights; the concept proved impractical for operational use. Coming from a guy who test-flew captured German jets and lived to tell about it, that's practically a death sentence for any aircraft design.\n\nThe program was quickly abandoned when everyone realized that asking pilots to fly combat missions while doing permanent push-ups wasn't exactly conducive to air superiority. The Prone Pilot Meteor remains a testament to the fact that just because you can redesign something doesn't mean you should.\n\nSpecs: Forward-swept wings, fly-by-wire flight controls, maximum instability by design\n\nThe X-29 resembled a fighter jet assembled from a kit without consulting the instructions first. Its forward-swept wings made it appear to be flying backwards even when sitting still, defying every basic principle of aircraft design that had worked perfectly well since the Wright Brothers.\n\nThis wasn't an accident, the forward-swept design was intentional, designed to improve maneuverability and reduce drag. The problem was that forward-swept wings want to twist themselves off the aircraft at high speeds, which is generally considered poor form in aviation circles. The X-29 used a triply redundant digital fly-by-wire flight-control system (with additional backup), because the airframe was intentionally unstable to operate constantly, just to prevent it from tearing itself apart in flight.\n\nNASA test pilots reported that the X-29 was incredibly agile but required the reflexes of a caffeinated mongoose to fly safely. The computer systems made about 40 flight-control corrections per second, because apparently the X-29's natural inclination was to immediately flip upside down and head for the nearest patch of ground.\n\nDespite looking completely wrong, the X-29 proved several important points about advanced aerodynamics and flight control systems. It also proved that American engineers could make anything fly if they were given enough computers and test pilots with nerves of steel.\n\nSome bizarre vehicles didn't stay as experiments: they actually rolled, floated, or flew into service. Awkward, odd, or downright laughable, these machines still managed to make their mark in real battles and operations, proving that sometimes weird just works.\n\nSpecs: 800mm gun, 1,350-ton weight, required an enormous support effort, on the order of thousands for transport, assembly, security, and rail work, while the firing crew itself was far smaller (often cited around 500), subtlety rating: zero\n\nThe Schwerer Gustav is what happened when German engineers were asked to build the biggest possible gun and forgot to ask, \"Why?\" or \"Is this necessary?\" This railway cannon was so absurdly oversized that it looked like someone had confused the blueprints for a battleship turret with those for a mobile artillery piece.\n\nEach shell weighed as much as a small car and could designed for extreme bunker-busting, often described in terms of several meters of reinforced concrete or around a meter of armor plate, depending on the shell. The gun itself required its own railway infrastructure, complete with curved tracks to handle the recoil. Moving Gustav required a logistics operation that would make Amazon's shipping department envious.\n\nThe entire setup looked like a mobile steel mountain. German artillery crews likely felt as though they were operating a mechanical volcano rather than a weapon. Gustav fired 47 rounds during the Sevastopol siege, where each shot cost roughly as much as a small fighter aircraft.\n\nDespite its impracticality, Gustav did exactly what it was designed to do: it obliterated anything it aimed at with the subtlety of a nuclear weapon and twice the engineering complexity. It remains the largest gun ever used in combat and possibly the most expensive way to deliver explosives ever invented.\n\nNecessary? I guess not. Worth it? Yes.\n\nSpecs: 6x6 amphibious capability, 2.5-ton payload, looked ridiculous, worked perfectly\n\nThe DUKW (pronounced \"Duck\") looked like what would happen if a truck and a boat had an awkward one-night stand and decided to make it work for the kids. This amphibious vehicle was essentially a standard GMC truck that had been taught to swim, with results that were both ungainly and brilliant.\n\nOn land, it looked like a boat with delusions of grandeur. In water, it looked like a truck having an identity crisis. The DUKW could carry supplies from ship to shore without needing docks, piers, or any infrastructure beyond a beach capable of supporting its weight.\n\nMilitary mechanics quickly learned to appreciate the Duck despite its unusual appearance. It could haul ammunition across rivers, deliver supplies to isolated units, and even serve as an impromptu ferry for troops. The DUKW became the Swiss Army knife of amphibious warfare, ugly, versatile, and absolutely indispensable.\n\nFrom Normandy beaches to Pacific atolls, the Duck waddled its way through every major amphibious operation of WWII. Soldiers might have laughed at it initially, but they learned to appreciate anything that could bring hot food and dry ammunition to the front lines. The DUKW proved that sometimes the best military vehicles are those that appear to have been designed by committee and built by optimists.\n\nSpecs: Half motorcycle, half tank, all weird, Opel 4-cylinder engine producing about 36 hp (26 kW), maximum confusion factor\n\nThe Kettenkrad resembled someone who had started building a motorcycle and, halfway through, decided it needed tank tracks instead of a rear wheel. German engineers deliberately created this mechanical centaur to handle terrain that would stop both motorcycles and tanks.\n\nWith handlebars like a Harley and tracks like a Panzer, the Kettenkrad could tow anti-tank guns through mud that would swallow a truck whole. German troops quickly discovered it could go places that wheeled vehicles couldn't reach and fit through spaces too small for tracked vehicles.\n\nThe steering system was a pure example of German engineering logic: the front wheel steered like a normal motorcycle at low speeds, but at higher speeds, differential braking on the tracks took over. This meant learning to drive one was like learning two completely different vehicles, depending on how fast you were going.\n\nDespite its odd appearance, Wehrmacht units loved the Kettenkrad. It could lay communication cables across rough terrain, tow equipment through forests, and even serve as a mobile command post for forward observers. German mechanics appreciated that it was reliable, serviceable, and could be repaired with standard motorcycle and tank parts.\n\nThe Kettenkrad remained in production throughout the war and was utilized in every theater where German forces were deployed. It proved that sometimes the best solution to a complex problem is to combine two working designs until something useful emerges.\n\nSpecs: Standard lorry chassis, roughly 6 inches (about 150 mm) of concrete armor (typically with reinforcement), mobility rating: \"eventually\"\n\nThe Bison wasn't sophisticated military engineering: it was what happened when Britain faced invasion and someone said, \"Let's pour concrete on trucks and see what happens.\" Built during the darkest days of 1940, these improvised armored vehicles were essentially mobile pillboxes for the Home Guard.\n\nThe concept was brilliantly simple: take a standard truck, build wooden forms around it, pour in concrete mixed with steel reinforcement, and voila, instant armored vehicle! The results looked like construction equipment that had gotten lost on the way to a building site and decided to join the army instead.\n\nThese concrete-clad lorries were slow, heavy, and about as maneuverable as their name suggests. British crews joked that the Bison could stop rifle bullets but not much else... Including hills, mud, or sharp turns. The weight of the concrete armor stressed every component of the truck chassis beyond its design limits.\n\nDespite their limitations, Bisons were deployed to guard airfields, coastal installations, and key infrastructure across Britain. Home Guard units appreciated having something that offered protection from small arms fire, even if it looked like a cement mixer with delusions of grandeur.\n\nThe Bison represented the spirit of British improvisation during WWII: it wasn't elegant, it wasn't sophisticated, but it was available, and it could stop a bullet.\n\nSpecs: Ground effect vehicle, 8 Kuznetsov NK-87 turbofans, about 340 mph (≈550 km/h) maximum cruising speed for the Lun-class, physics-defying capabilities\n\nThe ekranoplane resembled what would happen if a jumbo jet and a naval destroyer had a baby and were raised on a steady diet of rocket fuel and Soviet ambition. This ground-effect vehicle was designed to skim just above the water's surface at incredible speeds, utilizing aerodynamic principles that most Western engineers considered theoretically interesting but practically insane.\n\nThe Lun-class was essentially a flying missile boat, equipped with six Moskit anti-ship missiles and enough turbofan engines to power a small airline. It could cruise at 380 mph just 10 feet above the waves, making it nearly impossible to detect on radar until it was too late.\n\nSoviet naval aviation crews described flying the ekranoplane as surreal, traveling at jet speeds while close enough to the water to see fish swimming below. The ground effect allowed it to carry massive payloads that would be impossible for conventional aircraft, but required perfect weather conditions and calm seas to operate safely.\n\nWestern intelligence agencies were baffled by early satellite photos of the ekranoplane. It was too big to be a conventional aircraft but clearly capable of flight, leading to speculation about everything from captured alien technology to secret nuclear programs. The reality was somehow even stranger than the rumors.\n\nThe Lun entered limited service with the Soviet Navy in the late 1980s but proved too specialized for practical deployment. It required specially trained crews, perfect weather conditions, and extensive support infrastructure. The project was abandoned after the Soviet Union collapsed, leaving the remaining ekranoplanes as monuments to the fact that Soviet engineers could make anything fly if you gave them enough engines and a creative interpretation of physics.\n\nSpecs: 45 tons, 5 turrets, ypically a 10-man crew (some sources cite higher numbers depending on variant or counting attached personnel), maximum chaos potential\n\nThe T-35 was the result of Soviet tank designers being asked to build a heavy tank, and they decided that if one turret was good, five turrets must be five times better. This mechanical monster bristled with weapons in every direction, looking like someone had taken a naval destroyer and taught it to drive on land.\n\nWith one main turret mounting a 76mm gun and four smaller turrets sporting 45mm guns and machine guns, the T-35 could theoretically engage multiple targets simultaneously. In practice, coordinating fire from five different turrets while moving across rough terrain proved about as practical as conducting an orchestra during an earthquake.\n\nThe T-35 was a crowd-pleaser at Red Square parades, where its imposing size and multiple turrets made it look unstoppable. Soviet propaganda films loved showing these mechanical fortresses rolling past the Kremlin, symbolizing the industrial might of the socialist state.\n\nCombat proved less impressive than parades. Several T-35s were deployed during the German invasion of 1941, where they were eventually knocked out or abandoned due to mechanical failures. Crews who operated them reported that coordinating five different weapons systems while under fire required skills that no amount of training could provide.\n\nThe T-35's greatest weakness wasn't enemy fire... It was its own complexity. With 11 crew members spread across five turrets, communication became a nightmare during combat. The tank was also mechanically unreliable, with a transmission that regularly failed under the strain of moving 45 tons of steel across rough terrain.\n\nDespite its poor combat record, the T-35 remains unforgettable for its sheer audacity. Soviet tank designers took the concept of \"more is better\" to its logical extreme, creating something that looked like it could conquer Europe single-handedly. The reality was more mundane, but the T-35's unique silhouette earned it a permanent place in military history.\n\nFrom prototypes that resembled designs by aliens to combat vehicles that actually made it to the battlefield despite appearing completely wrong, these machines remind us that military engineering has always walked the fine line between genius and madness.\n\nEngineers were often tasked with solving seemingly impossible problems with limited resources and boundless imagination. Sometimes the answers came in shapes that defied common sense and challenged every design principle ever written. The results were vehicles that might not have been beautiful, practical, or even particularly effective, but they worked well enough to earn their place in history.\n\nWhat unites all these mechanical oddities is their willingness to challenge convention. These weren't incremental improvements on existing designs, they were bold leaps into uncharted territory, powered by caffeine, determination, and the kind of engineering confidence that comes from never having been told something is impossible.\n\nSome never went beyond testing, while others waddled, crawled, or flew their way into real combat. However, they all demonstrate that the line between brilliant innovation and spectacular failure is often thinner than the blueprints on which they were drawn. And sometimes, the weirdest ideas are the ones that teach us the most about what's actually possible when you stop worrying about what things are supposed to look like.",

    "title": "Now Ukrainian Drones Are Taking Out The Riders (But Not The Horses) Of Russian Cavalry, What Century Am I In?",
    "description": "In strict military terms, what the Russians are deploying are probably closer to dragoons than proper cavalry.",
    "fullText": "Coming into the year 2026, Ukrainian drone operators are getting better at taking out Russian horse cavalry, and yes that is a real sentence. Over the last few weeks, the invading army appears to be experimenting with new forms of assault, given that its advance has slowed to a crawl. Large-wave attacks were neutralized by NATO-made heavy artillery, and motorized transports have been torn apart by kamikaze drones and land mines. That led to individual soldiers trying to rush across no-man's land on foot, but drones made short work of them. What's left to try but returning to the 19th century?\n\nIn strict military terms, what the Russians are deploying are probably closer to dragoons than proper cavalry. As with earlier ATV assaults, this is just old-fashioned Russian infantry using a vehicle to move around quickly before jumping off and fighting on foot. It speaks volumes that they've gotten to this point: the invaders must be desperate for spare parts, forcing them to turn to animals. That's an indicator of general economic deterioration. However, as the Telegraph points out, horses are not made of metal, a tactical advantage against magnetic land mines.\n\nThat's not to say these horses aren't hi-tech! The Russians have outfitted their horses with Starlink terminals, and yes that is also a real sentence. The Kyiv Post reports soldiers throwing a rig together, including a dish and a console. As the article notes, SpaceX is supposedly not doing business with Russia, but workarounds grant the soldiers access. Russian military expert Samuel Bendett told Forbes that this all looks like ad hoc improvisation by individual units in the field, rather than a coordinated doctrine from Moscow.\n\nhttps://t.co/BeT9UQpCRopic.twitter.com/626A5HNKfM\n\n— OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) December 26, 2025\n\nAs always, the actual horses don't have much say in the matter and don't know what's going on. The Ukrainians apparently didn't want to kill the quadrupedal conscripts, which required a change in tactics. Normally, the kamikaze drones would just dive-bomb the soldier on the vehicle, taking out both. To save the poor horse, operators now buzz the equine to spook it, throwing off the rider. The drone the circles back to strike the dismounted soldier. That's battlefield empathy for you. The video above shows an example.\n\nThe whole thing is an example of opposing forces experimenting and adapting to one another, something that Russia and Ukraine have been doing since the invasion began. Drone warfare in particular is being tested in this war, with new tactics popping up all the time. The U.S. military has taken note and is actively trying to pivot to smaller, cheaper platforms itself. As the world adapts to this new form of conflict, expect more innovations and counter-innovations to appear, both in technology and doctrine. Even satellite-equipped dragoons, apparently. When the infantry starts forming squares, you know it's getting dire.\n\nWant more like this?

    "fullText": "Russia said Friday it used its latest missile against Ukraine for a second time in the nearly 4-year-old war, a forceful signal to Kyiv and its Western allies as U.S.-led peace talks have entered a new and crucial stage.\n\nThe hypersonic Oreshnik intermediate range ballistic missile hit Ukraine's western Lviv region late Thursday night, although officials there did not mention any casualties. The area is near a military base in neighboring Poland, a NATO member, that serves as a key hub for ferrying Western military supplies to Kyiv.\n\nSome Moscow commentators said the attack was a warning to European leaders against proposals to deploy their troops to Ukraine as part of a prospective peace deal. Russia has said it won't accept such a deployment and would view those forces as legitimate targets.\n\nA look at the weapon and why Russia used it now:\n\nWhat’s known about the Oreshnik\n\nRussia first used the multiple-warhead Oreshnik on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro in November 2024.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin said the Oreshnik, which means “hazelnut tree” in Russian, streaks at 10 times the speed of sound, or Mach 10, “like a meteorite,” and was immune to any missile defense system.\n\nHe said the weapon is so powerful that several such missiles -- even fitted with conventional warheads — could be as devastating as a nuclear strike. He said it’s capable of destroying underground bunkers “three, four or more floors down.”\n\nThe Russian military said the Oreshnik can carry nuclear or conventional warheads and can reach any European target.\n\nThe Pentagon said the Oreshnik was an experimental type of intermediate-range ballistic missile, or IRBM, based on Russia’s RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. Intermediate-range missiles can fly between 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,400 miles). Such weapons were banned under a Soviet-era treaty that Washington and Moscow abandoned in 2019.\n\nWhen Russia first used the Oreshnik, Ukraine’s military said the missile had six independently targetable warheads, each carrying six submunitions.\n\nRussian military bloggers said the submunitions released by each warhead apparently were unarmed but had high kinetic energy estimated to deliver a destructive force equivalent to tons of explosives.\n\nSince the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia has used swarms of cheap slow-flying drones and an assortment of other missiles, but none had the range and power of Oreshnik.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said last month the Oreshnik had been deployed to Belarus and entered active service. It didn't specify how many missiles were sent to the key ally of Moscow and whether they were fitted with nuclear warheads, but Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that up to 10 Oreshnik systems will be stationed there.\n\nRussia previously has stationed tactical nuclear weapons inside Belarus, whose territory it used to launch the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn 2024, Putin released a revised nuclear doctrine that placed Belarus under Russia's atomic umbrella. The document significantly lowered the threshold for the possible use of nuclear weapons, declaring that any nation’s conventional attack on Russia that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack on the country. The threat was clearly aimed at discouraging the West from allowing Ukraine to strike Russia with longer-range weapons.\n\nUnlike Russia's other shorter-range conventional weapons, the Oreshnik is able to launch a powerful, conventional strike anywhere in Europe, giving the Kremlin a new instrument of escalation without tapping its nuclear arsenal. There will be no way to know whether the missile is carrying a nuclear or a conventional warhead before it hits the target.\n\nRussia's message by using the Oreshnik\n\nWhen Russia first used the Oreshnik, Putin described it as a response to Ukraine's Western allies allowing it to use their longer-range weapons to strike Russian territory.\n\nIts latest strike comes as the U.S.-led efforts to end the war in Ukraine have entered a pivotal stage and appears to underline Putin’s intention to negotiate from a position of strength as his troops make slow but steady territorial gains.\n\nSome Russian military bloggers noted that the strike in Lviv, not far from the Polish border, was a message intended for Kyiv’s allies. Those members of the “coalition of the willing” have proposed sending their troops to Ukraine as part of security guarantees once a peace deal is reached.\n\nRussia has said it won't accept any European forces in Ukraine, seeing them as legitimate targets.\n\n“For the first time, NATO command has been shown a strategic weapons strike virtually on its border,” said military expert Valery Shiryayev. “This action is intended to demonstrate the determination of Russia’s military and political leadership to use such weapons with nuclear warheads if necessary.”\n\nThe attack comes less than a week after the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a Russian ally. The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced the U.S. action as an act of aggression and sharply criticized Wednesday’s U.S. seizure of a Russia-flagged tanker.",

    "description": "The Ukranian military has relied heavily on Starlink satellites for communications since Russia invaded in 2022, but this response seems implausible.",
    "fullText": "Even if you've never used the service you're likely familiar with Starlink, the global internet service provider that depends on an array of satellites in low-earth orbit (LEO). SpaceX launched the first Starlink satellites in 2019, and since them more than 9,000 more have joined those initial five dozen. Starlink plans an eventual fleet of over 40,000, but before that can happen Russia seems interested in knocking some of them out of commission.\n\nIn late December of 2025 the Associated Press reported that \"Two NATO-nation intelligence services suspect Russia is developing a new anti-satellite weapon to target Elon Musk's Starlink constellation.\" The unnamed services apparently said Russia wouldn't target satellites individually or with electromagnetic pulse devices but rather employ a \"zone-effect\" weapon consisting of a cloud of dense pellets. While any unsourced reports should be taken lightly, potential Russian interest in taking out Starlink satellites could be due to Ukraine's dependence on Starlink since Russia invaded in 2022. While anti-satellite weapons aren't new, they present significant risk in the form of widespread debris fields that could threaten other satellites.\n\nA \"zone effect\" weapon like the one mentioned is akin to firing a shotgun blast at the satellites, with one major difference. While shotgun pellets are limited by physics and gravity to a few seconds of flight, debris in space continues zipping around until it hits something or is captured by the earth's gravity field. The AP quoted defense expert Victoria Samson of the Secure World Foundation as saying \"I would be very surprised, frankly, if they were to do something like that.\" Brigadier General Christopher Horner — who commands the Space division of the Canadian military — wasn't so sure. After confirming that his intelligence services hadn't turned up any evidence of such a weapon, he added the caveat \"it's not implausible.\"\n\nStarlink satellites travel at 27,000 km/h (almost 17,000 mph) and orbit at 550 km (341.75 miles) above the earth. Hitting even a small object at that speed can cause catastrophic damage to the delicate structures and instruments on a satellite, and Starlink's aren't the only ones in low-earth orbit.\n\nNASA defines low-earth orbit as below 1,200 miles, noting that the International Space Station occupies this level of space and that it plans to expand access to \"include government agencies, commercial providers, academic organizations, and potentially more.\"\n\nDepoloying a \"zone-effect\" weapon like the one described in Associated Press' reporting would certainly cause indiscriminate damage to these satellites. The potential risks would be obvious to any rogue state on the planet, and Russia surely has scientists who understand them. Even if Russia never plans on developing or using such a device, it's possible this story has been fabricated and leaked to deter Starlink's operational support of Ukraine. Starlink is also providing internet service in Venezuela after U.S. military operations there, although that's only through February 3.\n\nZone-effect weapons are relatively low-tech, and Russia has a dedicated space launch agency with the ability to deploy much more capable anti-satellite weapons. Among the most powerful military air defense systems in the world is Russia's S-500 Prometheus, which can take out satellites in the near reaches of low-earth orbit. The S-500 was engineered as a defensive weapon, but it's not a huge leap in logic to imagine it being used in a \"zone effect\" or other attack on Starlink satellites.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin's launch of an Oreshnik hypersonic missile appears aimed at intimidating Ukraine and sending a signal of Russian military might to Europe and the United States at a crucial juncture in talks to end the war.\n\nPutin has repeatedly boasted of the speed and destructive power of the Oreshnik, which ​Russia first fired at Ukraine in November 2024. Since then, it has kept the weapon in reserve.\n\nThe overnight Oreshnik strike in western Ukraine came after a week of setbacks for Russia. ‌On Saturday, President Donald Trump sent U.S. special forces to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a close Putin ally, and on Wednesday U.S. forces seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the north Atlantic.\n\nOn Tuesday, Britain and France announced plans to deploy troops in Ukraine ‌in the event of a ceasefire - prompting Moscow to respond that it would view foreign soldiers as legitimate combat targets.\n\nGerhard Mangott, a Russia specialist at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, said Moscow was frustrated at being sidelined during weeks of diplomacy between the U.S., Ukraine and the Europeans, and \"particularly mad\" about the planned potential troop deployment by Kyiv's European allies. The use of the Oreshnik should be seen in that context, he said.\n\n\"It's a signal to the United States and the Europeans about the military capabilities of the Russian army,\" Mangott said in a telephone interview.\n\nHe said Moscow wanted to convey that \"Russia is to be taken seriously, given its military arsenal, ⁠and that the Europeans and Trump should return to a minimum of respect ‌for the Russian position in the negotiations.\"\n\n'DESTRUCTION NOT NECESSARILY THE GOAL'\n\nThe Oreshnik is capable of carrying nuclear as well as conventional warheads, although there was no suggestion of any nuclear component to the latest attack.\n\nA senior Ukrainian official told Reuters that the missile struck a state enterprise in the western city of Lviv and ‍was likely carrying inert or \"dummy\" warheads - as in 2024, when Russia first fired it to test the weapon in war.\n\n\"It does appear that at this point Russia is using Oreshnik for signaling purposes, so the destruction is not necessarily the goal,\" Pavel Podvig, director of the Russian Nuclear Forces Project, told Reuters when asked if the use of dummy warheads would diminish the capacity of Moscow's action to intimidate Ukraine and its allies.\n\n\"It's probably a general signal of resolve ​to escalate. My guess is that it will be read this way by the West,\" he said.\n\nWestern reaction to the attack, around 60 km (40 miles) from Ukraine's border with NATO member Poland, was swift. ‌The leaders of Britain, France and Germany called it \"escalatory and unacceptable\". European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said it was \"a clear escalation against Ukraine and meant as a warning to Europe and to the U.S.\".\n\nRUSSIAN STATEMENT ON REASON FOR MISSILE USE DRAWS SCEPTICISM\n\nRussia specialist Mangott was sceptical about the official statement from Russia's Defence Ministry that the Oreshnik launch was in response to an alleged Ukraine drone strike targeting one of Putin's residences, in the northern region of Novgorod, late last month. Ukraine has denied any such attack took place, accusing Moscow of lying about it in order to derail peace talks.\n\nSeveral high-profile Russian war bloggers also criticised the official framing of the strike as a revenge attack. One, Yuri Baranchik, suggested it would have \"looked more convincing\" if Moscow had fired the missile at President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's bunker in Kyiv.\n\nMick Ryan, ⁠an Australian military expert, linked the weapon's use to Russia's recent setbacks, especially over Venezuela.\n\nHe said the point was \"to demonstrate ​that Russia remains a nuclear-armed world power. In this guise, it is a psychological weapon – an instrument of Putin’s cognitive war ​against Ukraine and the West – rather than a weapon of mass physical destruction.\"\n\nRussian arch-hawk Dmitry Medvedev, a former president who is now deputy chairman of Putin's Security Council, alluded in a social media post to the capture of Maduro, the oil tanker seizure by the U.S. and the possibility of further U.S. sanctions against Russia, which he ‍said had made for a \"stormy\" start to the year.\n\nIn ⁠comments highly critical of Washington, he said international relations had descended into a madhouse and compared the Oreshnik strike to \"a life-saving injection of haloperidol\", an anti-psychotic drug.\n\nProminent Russian war blogger Fighterbomber, a former military serviceman, said he thought the use of the Oreshnik was a display of power to convey a message and that Moscow would not be resorting to it often.\n\nHe noted that ⁠some Oreshnik systems had been transferred to Belarus and that Russia would have some of its own in reserve, but suggested that there was not an endless supply of the relatively new missile.\n\n\"Taking all these constants into account, we can assume that ‌we can afford to conduct such demonstrations two or three times a year,\" he wrote.\n\nHe expressed hope that no further launches would be needed for now, concluding: \"The signals have ‌been sent and they have been heard.\"",

    "description": "France's defense ministry picked Mistral to supply military AI systems running on national infrastructure, demonstrating Europe's push for tech sovereignty.",
    "fullText": "French AI startup Mistral has secured a major vote of confidence from its home government after landing a deal to provide AI technology to France's military.\n\nFrance's Ministry of the Armed Forces said on Thursday that it has formally notified a framework agreement with Mistral AI, giving the country's armed forces, defense agencies, and affiliated public institutions access to the company's advanced AI models, software, and services.\n\nUnder the deal overseen by the ministry's defense AI agency, Mistral's AI systems will be deployed on French-controlled infrastructure, a key priority for the military as governments grow increasingly cautious about where sensitive data is processed and which laws govern it.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post announcing the deal, Mistral said its AI systems would be deployed on France's own infrastructure and fine-tuned using defense-specific data to support operational military needs.\n\nThe financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed. Mistral was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Business Insider.\n\nThe agreement marks a significant win for Mistral, which was founded in 2023 and is valued at roughly $13.6 billion, following a 1.7 billion euro ($2 billion) funding round announced last year.\n\nThe startup has positioned itself as a European alternative to US AI heavyweights, such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, pitching its models as powerful yet more compatible with Europe's sovereignty and data control ambitions.\n\nIn its statement, translated by Business Insider, the defense ministry said the partnership is intended to strengthen France's \"technological sovereignty\" and ensure the armed forces maintain control over critical AI tools used across military operations and administration.\n\nBertrand Rondepierre, director of the ministry's defense AI agency, said the agreement represents \"a major step\" in strengthening the ministry's generative AI capabilities and preparing the armed forces for future challenges, while maintaining sovereign control over the technologies used.\n\nThe deal comes as European governments reassess their dependence on US technology in strategic sectors ranging from cloud computing to semiconductors and now AI.\n\nThe French ministry's move mirrors that of the US government, which has increasingly inked major contracts with domestic AI companies to develop tools for military and national security use, including recent deals with OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, and other defense-focused startups.\n\nAs generative AI becomes increasingly embedded in military planning, logistics, and analysis, Mistral's latest win helps to position the startup as one of Europe's key players in the race to develop sovereign alternatives to American tech giants.\n\nDo you work for Mistral and have a tip or story to share?

    "title": "The US military's annual suicide report is missing, and the Pentagon isn't offering any answers",
    "description": "Pentagon reporting on military suicide rates is usually released each fall. Right now, it remains unpublished, with no explanation.",
    "fullText": "A critical data source for US military suicide prevention efforts is late.\n\nThe annual suicide report, which the Department of Defense typically publishes each fall, provides suicide statistics from the previous calendar year that inform Congress, researchers, and senior leaders across the services on efforts to combat military suicide, a persistent problem.\n\nThe defense department is also delayed in releasing its quarterly suicide data for 2025, with the third-quarter figures still unpublished, months later than usual.\n\nBusiness Insider queried the Pentagon in mid-December about the anticipated release date of the annual report.\n\n\"The Department has nothing to announce at this time,\" a department spokesperson replied in an email. \"We will follow up if anything changes.\" When asked again this week why the report is delayed and when it might be published, the Pentagon did not respond.\n\nBusiness Insider sent a separate email query to the Defense Suicide Prevention Office, which releases the report. The office did not respond.\n\nIt is unclear whether the delay is tied to the government shutdown.\n\nThough the data is beneficial, the monthslong delay is unlikely to significantly affect research or prevention efforts, said Ron Kessler, a principal investigator on a long-term Army suicide study and a professor of healthcare policy at Harvard Medical School. He said researchers depend more frequently on detailed data that reveals patterns and circumstances around deaths.\n\nThe bigger issue is tied to accountability, public transparency, and oversight, he said.\n\n\"Publishing is letting the outside world know what's going on,\" Keller said. \"And that's useful for holding organizations accountable.\"\n\nThe Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs have each tried to improve suicide prevention efforts, Kessler said, highlighting a project he's involved in that's testing whether artificial intelligence can effectively identify people at risk of suicide. The annual reports reveal the level of progress and show where further work is needed.\n\n\"It's important for the data to be out there,\" Kessler added, \"not to ever be to a point where we say what's not being shown anymore. It's good for the public to be able to say, 'Is the military doing a good job? What's going on?'\"\n\nSuicide deaths among service members rose during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the most recent publicly available data — from calendar year 2023 — showed a small increase over the year prior. According to the Defense Suicide Prevention Office, military suicide deaths have increased gradually since 2011.\n\nThe 2023 report showed that young enlisted men accounted for the largest share of suicide deaths in the US military. That mirrors broader national trends. American men are nearly four times more likely to die by suicide than women, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.\n\nFirearms were involved in roughly half of all US suicide deaths in 2023, and previous military reports have repeatedly identified access to firearms as a risk factor, particularly for younger enlisted personnel.\n\nSome military leaders recently emphasized suicide prevention needs during the holiday season. In November, Army Secretary Dan Driscoll directed supervisors across the Army to conduct daily check-ins with their subordinates through mid-January.\n\nThough the initiative was initially lauded, some supervisors and troops online have described the mandatory directive as unintentionally burdensome.\n\nThe broader Pentagon reporting delays coincide with certain organizational changes inside the Army. A September Army memo highlighted plans to disband its directorate responsible for overseeing soldier quality-of-life issues, known as a G-9, citing \"administrative convenience.\" The responsibilities of that office have since been folded into the service's human resources directorate.\n\nArmy spokeswoman Heather J. Hagan confirmed the change to Business Insider on Thursday, adding that the service remains committed to troop and family quality of life.\n\nIt is unclear how the change may affect oversight of soldier well-being or how suicide prevention priorities are being evaluated, as the Pentagon's annual suicide data remains unpublished.",

    "title": "The military is running out of teenagers to recruit — and old-school methods to reach them are failing",
    "description": "The military faces a new recruiting crisis as America's teen population shrinks and outreach methods fail. The Pentagon is rethinking its playbook.",
    "fullText": "Military recruiting is on the upswing, but many recruiters say it's never been harder to get young people interested in service.\n\nPhone lists of numbers that once rang a family landline now dead-end at parents' cellphones. School access can vary from one street to the next. And while a direct message might be the fastest way to reach an overly online 17-year-old, finding the right social media handle can feel like chasing ghosts. The hunt has become so grueling that the time it takes to meet quotas of up to two recruits a month is pushing some recruiters into burnout territory.\n\nThese are some of the frustrations Business Insider heard while speaking to nearly four dozen Marine recruiters, leaders, and other officials for a four-part series on recruiter welfare.\n\nThe hunt for solutions is on, and legislation and use of artificial intelligence could be on the horizon.\n\nThe Pentagon is facing steep declines in young Americans' propensity and fitness to serve and public confidence in the military, long one of the government's most-trusted institutions, according to public polling.\n\nBoosting young Americans' interest in service, and reaching them in the first place, will require more than traditional military recruiting efforts, those involved agree. Political momentum for broader measures is already building.\n\nProject 2025, the conservative policy blueprint, outlines a major expansion of recruiting in schools: increased access for recruiters, more Junior ROTC programs, and a requirement that federally funded schools administer the military entrance exam. An effort to provide recruiters with improved access to high schools was included in the national defense spending bill signed into law in December.\n\nThe office of the defense secretary, which did not respond to a request for comment, recently established a new Recruitment Task Force. The Corps' Recruiting Command, which is part of the task force, is seeking legislative changes to help \"improve the student data collected in support of recruiting,\" a Marine spokesman told Business Insider.\n\nExperts are pressing for urgent solutions as population shifts reduce pools of young people eligible for the military.\n\n\"The coming declining birth rate challenge is so pronounced, even if the services were doing everything right to get to our current requirements, the math is just going to change,\" said Kate Kuzminski, the director of studies at the Center for a New American Security and author of a recent report on recruiting.\n\nOver the next 16 years, the total number of children turning 18 is expected to fall by 700,000, representing a 13% drop, according to Kuzminski's research.\n\n\"Recruiters' jobs are going to be made a lot more difficult by this generational decline,\" Kuzminski said. Soon, they'll be forced to contend with capturing a larger percentage of American youth than ever before to meet the same end-strength requirements.\n\nAs recruiting pools narrow, the Army and Navy have found a way to turn otherwise unqualified young people into fit recruits, with new pre-boot camp preparatory courses to help applicants raise test scores or lose weight to meet military fitness standards.\n\nThe approach has helped dramatically boost enlistments. But the effort has drawn scrutiny over whether those services are accepting too many low-scoring applicants.\n\n\"The things that have worked up until now are not going to work in the future,\" Kuzminski said of recruiting.\n\nFor now, Marines still find new recruits by canvassing malls, attending community events, visiting schools, messaging social media accounts, and making dozens of phone calls that often reach a parent who isn't thrilled about the idea of their child joining the military.\n\nHigh schools that receive federal funding are legally required to allow recruiters access to grounds for pitches to classrooms or career fairs. But several recruiters said access isn't uniformly offered, and can hinge on the relationships recruiters foster with educators.\n\nA Marine recruiting official said geography can play a role and that some areas in the Northeast are known for more regularly keeping out recruiters.\n\nMore than half a dozen recruiters said conservative or rural areas aren't necessarily more welcoming, either. In their view, new enlistees are rarely motivated by politics; they're drawn by purpose, belonging, and the promise of financial stability.\n\nEven in places where \"support the troops\" is a common refrain, recruiters said, many parents resist the idea of their children joining the military.\n\nAnother factor: With fewer Americans personally connected to the armed forces, interest in enlisting has waned. A dwindling veteran population means fewer role models to inspire the next generation, and after two decades of the Global War on Terror, some veterans discourage their own children from serving.\n\nRecruiters say this reflects a growing divide between the military and civilian America — and a misunderstanding of what daily military life can entail — not just heroic Navy SEALs, or Top Gun pilots, but also equipment maintenance, human resources management, and mundane planning for those holding senior ranks.\n\nThe result of this divide, recruiters said, isn't just apathy. Three recruiters told Business Insider they've had guns pulled on them when visiting homes. One, who remains on active duty, recalled being called a \"baby killer\" and a \"slave\" to the government by an irate parent.\n\nAs phone lists falter and school access remains inconsistent — problems compounded by falling US birth rates and shrinking pools of potential recruits — recruiters are trying to meet teens where they already are: online. Social media has become a routine part of the job; artificial intelligence, meanwhile, is only beginning to surface as a potential tool.\n\nMany recruiters already use social media to connect with young people, though with varying results. Earlier this year, the Army tried partnering with influencers already in uniform to pique interest in enlistment, an effort that was halted after running into legal hurdles.\n\nWhen it comes to contacting prospective recruits through social media, some recruiters say it can feel inappropriate, acutely aware of past misconduct cases and wary of how easily online interactions can blur boundaries.\n\nAt the same time, the military's ties with Big Tech are deepening and opening new doors. A handful of leaders from Silicon Valley, including executives from Palantir, Meta, and OpenAI, were commissioned into the US Army Reserve earlier this year. It's part of a larger Army transformation effort to prepare the service for future conflicts, which some defense experts have said will require help from Silicon Valley.\n\nIn building the manpower for the future fight, leaning on emerging technology and, particularly, artificial intelligence could help recruiters identify and contact young people who may be predisposed to service, such as athletes, gamers, or those interested in science, technology, engineering, and math fields, said retired Marine Col. Bill Gray, who led recruiting efforts across the Southeast from 2018 to 2021.\n\nRecruiting has long been one of the military's toughest jobs, and when it tanks, Gray said, the answer has long been to expect recruiters to work harder, an idea that he said feels out of date with emerging technologies.\n\nOne fix, he said, could be giving recruiters access to contact information that's publicly available but not easily accessible. He recalled once watching recruiters flip through physical copies of high school yearbooks to zero in on star athletes and other standout students, a time-suck.\n\n\"It's mind-boggling to me that we are even having this conversation because of the time that could be saved,\" he said. \"You could be processing at machine speed instead of one-human speed.\"\n\nWithout a draft, increased face time with prospective recruits would be critical if the nation were to enter a large-scale war, said one senior Marine official familiar with recruiting demands who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nWhile AI tools have the potential to make connecting with recruits easier, the official said that effort could run up against federal laws restricting the military's ability to collect or analyze data about US citizens.\n\n\"We are recruiting children,\" the official said. \"It's good that it's hard for our recruiters to find children who want to join. It should not be easy.\"\n\n\"There's a reluctance to go down some of these paths,\" Gray, the retired colonel, said. \"People say, 'Well, we're making mission, so if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" Some recruiters say the system is breaking them — putting them under stress and threatening to derail their military careers.\n\n\"You could make life so much easier for those guys and gals,\" Gray said.",

    "fullText": "The \"TACO trade,\" short for Trump Always Chickens Out, was one of the great market memes of 2025. Whenever the market would throw a tantrum about a Trump policy — usually related to tariffs — the president would reverse course to stem the bleeding.\n\nA similar story has played out this week within US defense stocks, with a few unique twists. Here's the minute-by-minute recap from Wednesday afternoon:\n\nIt was that last statement, 2 hours and 9 minutes after Trump's first post about defense companies, that sparked a rally in those exact same defense stocks on Thursday. The optimism of a huge spending increase had offset the initial sting of industry criticism.\n\nIt wasn't a precise TACO trade situation. It was closer to something I'd like to coin as the TUNA trade: Trump Usually Negates Announcements. The president didn't outright reverse a prior statement. He countered a bearish opinion with something bullish that counterbalanced it. There's a big difference!\n\nThe volatile episode leaves questions unanswered about the future of the industry. The knee-jerk reaction from investors was to buy/sell first, then ask questions later. What does the longer term look like?\n\nWall Street analysts generally support the idea that the additional military spending will offset any new capital restrictions.\n\n\"The changes are significant but not necessarily draconian,\" said JPMorgan analyst Seth Seifman. A \"potential budget increase would support sustained growth, taking some sting out of the executive order.\"\n\nKen Herbert, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, says large-cap defense companies will feel the squeeze more than their defense-tech counterparts, which he sees outperforming.\n\n\"Defense primes will look to de-risk major program investments by securing long-term purchase agreements, where possible,\" he added.\n\nJefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu called Trump's comments an \"overreach\" and said that they catalyzed something that was already bound to happen.\n\n\"The industry has been clear that it is ready to invest on clearer demand signals,\" she said.\n\nFrom a demand perspective, $1.5 trillion in 2027 sounds quite appealing. If all goes according to plan — and that's a big \"if\" — more stock gains could be in store for defense companies.",

The effort to disarm Hezbollah comes after a Washington-brokered ceasefire ended a war between the group and Israel in 2024.",
    "fullText": "BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon's military said Thursday it had concluded the first phase of a plan to fully deploy across southern Lebanon and disarm non-state groups, notably Hezbollah.\n\nIsrael said the development was encouraging but “far from sufficient,\" and its Foreign Ministry said the group still has dozens of compounds and other infrastructure.\n\nThe effort to disarm Hezbollah comes after a Washington-brokered ceasefire ended a war between the group and Israel in 2024.\n\nThe military's statement, which did not name Hezbollah or any other armed groups, came before President Joseph Aoun met with Prime Minister Nawaf Salam and his government to discuss the deployment and disarmament plans. Both said disarming non-state groups was a priority upon beginning their terms not long after the ceasefire went into effect.\n\nLebanon's top officials have endorsed the military announcement.\n\nA statement by Aoun’s office ahead of the Cabinet meeting called on Israel to stop its attacks, withdraw from areas it occupies, and release Lebanese prisoners. He called on friendly countries not to send weapons to Lebanon unless it's to state institutions — an apparent reference to Iran which for decades has sent weapons and munitions to Hezbollah.\n\nSpeaker Nabih Berri, a key ally of Hezbollah who played a leading role in ceasefire talks, issued a statement saying the people of southern Lebanon are “thirsty for the army's presence and protection.\"\n\nIsrael maintains that despite Lebanon’s efforts, Hezbollah is still attempting to rearm itself in southern Lebanon.\n\n“The ceasefire agreement brokered by the United States between Israel and Lebanon states clearly, Hezbollah must be fully disarmed,\" a statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office read. “This is imperative for Israel’s security and Lebanon’s future.”\n\nIsrael's Foreign Ministry said in a later statement that the group is “rearming faster than it is being disarmed,\" and showed a map of alleged Hezbollah compounds, launch sites, and underground networks south of the Litani River.\n\nPlan to restrict weapons at an ‘advanced stage’\n\nThe text of the ceasefire agreement is vague as to how Hezbollah’s weapons and military facilities north of the Litani River should be treated, saying Lebanese authorities should dismantle unauthorized facilities starting with the area south of the river.\n\nHezbollah insists that the agreement only applies south of the Litani, while Israel maintains that it applies to the whole country. The Lebanese government has said it will eventually remove non-state weapons throughout the country.\n\nThe agreement is seen as a procedure to implement prior United Nations Security Council agreements that call for disarmament of non-state groups and the withdrawal of all occupying forces, and for the Lebanese state to have full control of its territory.\n\nInformation Minister Paul Morcos said after the Cabinet meeting that the army will start working on a plan for disarmament north of the Litani river that will be discussed by the government in February. He added that the army will also continue the process of weapons “containment” in other parts of Lebanon, meaning that they will not be allowed to be used or moved.\n\nThe Lebanese military has been clearing tunnels, rocket-launching positions, and other structures since its disarmament proposal was approved by the government and went into effect in September.\n\nThe government had set a deadline of the end of 2025 to clear the area south of the Litani River of non-state weapons.\n\n“The army confirms that its plan to restrict weapons has entered an advanced stage, after achieving the goals of the first phase effectively and tangibly on the ground,” the military statement read. “Work in the sector is ongoing until the unexploded ordnance and tunnels are cleared ... with the aim of preventing armed groups from irreversibly rebuilding their capabilities.”\n\nHezbollah did not immediately comment on the Lebanese announcement.\n\nOfficials have said the next stage of the disarmament plan is in segments of southern Lebanon between the Litani and the Awali rivers, which include Lebanon’s port city of Sidon, but they have not set a timeline for that phase.\n\nIsrael continues to strike Lebanon near daily and occupies five strategic hilltop points along the border, the only areas south of the Litani where the military said it has yet to control.\n\nRegular meetings have taken place between the Lebanese and the Israelis alongside the United States, France, and the U.N. peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, to monitor developments after the ceasefire.\n\nLebanon’s cash-strapped military has since been gradually dispersing across wide areas of southern Lebanon between the Litani and the U.N.-demarcated “Blue Line” that separates the tiny country from Israel. The military has also been slowly confiscating weapons from armed Palestinian factions in refugee camps.\n\nIsrael accuses Hezbollah of trying to rebuild its battered military capacity and has said that the Lebanese military’s efforts are not sufficient, raising fears of a new escalation. Lebanon, meanwhile, said Israel's strikes and control of the hilltops were an obstacle to the efforts.\n\nLebanon also hopes that disarming Hezbollah and other non-state groups will help to bring in money needed for reconstruction after the 2024 war.\n\nHezbollah says it has been cooperative with the army in the south but will not discuss disarming elsewhere before Israel stops its strikes and withdraws from Lebanese territory.\n\nThe latest Israel-Hezbollah conflict began the day after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel triggered the war in Gaza. The militant group Hezbollah, largely based in southern Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel in support of Hamas and the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael responded with airstrikes and shelling. The low-level conflict escalated into full-scale war in September 2024. Israeli strikes killed much of Hezbollah's senior leadership and left the group severely weakened.\n\nHezbollah still has political clout, holding a large number of seats in parliament representing the Shiite Muslim community and two cabinet ministers.",

    "fullText": "The federal agent who shot and killed a driver in Minneapolis is an Iraq War veteran who has served for nearly two decades in the Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to records obtained Thursday by The Associated Press.\n\nJonathan Ross, who shot and killed Renee Good on Wednesday, has served as a deportation officer with ICE since 2015, records show. He was seriously injured last summer when he was dragged by the vehicle of a fleeing suspect whom he shot with a stun gun.\n\nFederal officials have not named the officer who shot Good, a 37-year-old mother who was shot as she tried to drive away from federal agents. But Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem said the agent who shot Good had been dragged by a vehicle last June, and a department spokesperson confirmed Noem was referring to the Bloomington, Minnesota, case in which documents identified the injured officer as Ross.\n\nNoem and other Trump administration officials have defended the agent as an experienced law enforcement professional who followed his training and shot Good after he believed she was trying to run him or other agents over with her vehicle. Video has raised questions about whether the shooting was in self-defense, and the FBI is investigating the deadly use of force. Some protesters are demanding that Ross face criminal charges, and Minnesota authorities also want to investigate.\n\nAttempts to reach Ross, 43, at phone numbers and email addresses associated with him were not immediately successful.\n\nHere are some things to know about him:\n\nExperienced military and law enforcement officer\n\nIn courtroom testimony last month, Ross said he deployed to Iraq from 2004 to 2005 with the Indiana National Guard. Ross said he served as a machine gunner on a gun truck as part of a combat patrol team.\n\nHe said he returned from Iraq in 2005, went to college and joined the Border Patrol in 2007 near El Paso, Texas. He worked there until 2015, serving as a field intelligence agent gathering and analyzing information on cartels and drug and human smuggling.\n\nRoss said he has served as a deportation officer based in Minnesota since he joined ICE in 2015. He is assigned to fugitive operations, seeking to arrest “higher value targets” in the ICE region that includes Minneapolis, he testified last month. He said that he was also a team leader with the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force.\n\n“So I develop the targets, create a target package, surveillance, and then develop a plan to execute the arrest warrant,” he said.\n\nRoss said that he was also a firearms instructor, an active shooter instructor, a field intelligence officer and member of the SWAT team. He said that he attended the Border Patrol’s academy in New Mexico, where he learned to speak Spanish.\n\nRoss was a leader of a team of agents who went to arrest a man who was in the U.S. illegally in the Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington on June 17. Agents had gathered outside the home of the man, Roberto Munoz-Guatemala, who left in his car, according to court records.\n\nFBI agents activated emergency sirens and lights instructing him to pull over but he did not. Ross pulled his vehicle diagonally in front of Munoz-Guatemala to force him to stop.\n\nRoss and an FBI agent identified themselves as police and pointed guns at Munoz-Guatemala, who raised his hands. Ross then approached Munoz-Guatemala’s vehicle and ordered him to put it in park.\n\nRoss told the driver to lower his window all the way down and warned that he would break it if he did not. Ross used a device known as a “spring-loaded window punch” to break the rear driver’s side window and reached inside the car to unlock the driver’s door.\n\nMunoz-Guatemela drove off while Ross’ arm was caught in the vehicle and accelerated, dragging Ross down the street. Ross fired his Taser, striking Munoz-Guatemala with prongs in the head, face and shoulder.\n\nMunoz-Guatemela was not incapacitated by the Taser, prosecutors said, and kept driving, taking Ross the length of a football field in 12 seconds. Ross was knocked free from the vehicle by force after Munoz-Guatemala drove onto a curb for a second time and back to the street.\n\nRoss’ right arm was bleeding, and an FBI agent applied a tourniquet. Eventually, he received dozens of stitches at a hospital. Prosecutors said he had “suffered multiple large cuts, and abrasions to his knee, elbow, and face.”\n\n“It was pretty excruciating pain,” Ross testified.\n\nMunoz-Guatemela was bleeding from his injuries and had a woman call 911, saying that he was assaulted and didn’t know whether the person trying to stop him was an officer. He was arrested and charged with assault on a federal officer with a dangerous or deadly weapon.\n\nA jury found Munoz-Guatemala guilty at a trial last month, finding he “should reasonably have known that Jonathan Ross was a law enforcement officer and not a private citizen attempting to assault him.”\n\nFederal officials defend the agent without identifying him\n\nVice President J.D. Vance praised the agent's service to the country Thursday without naming him, saying the ICE officer “deserves a debt of gratitude.”\n\n“This is a guy who’s actually done a very, very important job for the United States of America,” Vance said. “He’s been assaulted. He’s been attacked. He’s been injured because of it.”\n\nDHS assistant Tricia McLaughlin declined to confirm the agent's identity Thursday, saying doing so would be dangerous for the safety of him and his family. But she noted that he had been selected for ICE’s special response team, which includes a 30-hour tryout and additional training on specialized skills such as breaching techniques, perimeter control, hostage rescue and firearms.\n\n“He acted according to his training,” she said. “This officer is a longtime ICE officer who has been serving his country his entire life.”",

    "description": "The president doubled down on his plans to take military action in Latin America, annex Greenland and more in a revealing new interview",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said that his only guardrail as he looks to obtain more global power is \"my own morality\"\n\nIn a new interview with The New York Times, he said he doesn't \"need international law\" to dictate his approach to foreign policy\n\nAlso in the interview, the president doubled down on his plans to take military action in Latin America, annex Greenland and more\n\nPresident Donald Trump is making it clear that he won't be constrained by the law as he continues teasing a takeover of the Western Hemisphere.\n\n“I don’t need international law,” Trump said in a new interview with The New York Times. “I’m not looking to hurt people.”\n\nWhen pressed further, the president said he understood that his administration would need to abide by international laws. However, he added, \"It depends what your definition of international law is.\"\n\nThere is, Trump insisted, just \"one thing\" that can curtail his desire for global supremacy: \"My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me.\"\n\nThe interview comes less than a week after U.S. forces, under Trump's direction, captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, first lady Cilia Flores, amid \"large-scale strikes\" on the capital city of Caracas, and brought them to the U.S. to stand trial on multiple charges related to narco terrorism.\n\nThough Venezuela has installed an interim leader, Delcy Rodríguez, Trump has stated many times that the United States is now in charge of running the independent nation.\n\n\"It's going to be run very judiciously, very fairly. And it's gonna make a lot of money,\" he previously said. \"You know they stole our oil. We built that whole industry and they just took it over like we were nothing. So we did something about it. We're late, but we did something about it.\"\n\nHe later added, \"We'll be selling large amounts of oil [from Venezuela] to other countries... We're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be.\"\n\n\"We're gonna make sure the people of Venezuela are taken care of... You're going to have peace, justice...you're going to have a real country.\"\n\nHe doesn't plan to stop there. The president is also fixated on his desire to annex Greenland, which is currently controlled by Denmark, a NATO ally of the U.S.\n\nTrump admitted that \"it may be a choice\" to preserve the country's relationship with NATO versus taking over Greenland, an important trade crossroads between the U.S., Europe, China and Russia.\n\n“It’s so strategic right now. Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,” he said to reporters aboard Air Force One on Jan. 4. “We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.”\n\nTo The New York Times, he insisted that it wasn't enough to have the country controlled by an ally — he wants exclusive, outright ownership.\n\n“Because that’s what I feel is psychologically needed for success. I think that ownership gives you a thing that you can’t do with, you’re talking about a lease or a treaty. Ownership gives you things and elements that you can’t get from just signing a document,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump also has his sights set on Colombia, Cuba, Iran and Mexico.\n\n\"You have to do something with Mexico. Mexico has to get their act together because they're pouring through Mexico and we're going to have to do something,\" he previously told reporters, referring to drug cartels in the country.\n\n\"We'd love Mexico to do it. They're capable of doing it, but unfortunately, the cartels are very strong in Mexico,\" Trump added.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nReferring to Colombian President Gustavo Petro, Trump said his country is being \"run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he’s not going to be doing it very long.\"\n\nPetro spoke with the Times prior to calling Trump to discuss the threats, expressing his concern about the U.S. making a strike in Colombia, similar to the one in Venezuela.\n\n“We are in danger,” the Colombian president said. “Because the threat is real. It was made by Trump.”",

    "title": "What Trump's plan to ban defense dividends and raise the military budget could mean for your portfolio",
    "description": "Defense stocks pay relatively high dividends, but there are alternative areas of the market for investors to consider if they want steady income.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump sent defense stocks on a roller coaster ride this week, and his recent executive orders on defense firms and his calls for more defense spending could impact investors' portfolios.\n\nThe president signed an order aimed at restricting some financial behavior among defense contractors, including an executive order that bans defense firms from issuing dividend payments and doing stock buybacks until they deliver a \"superior product.\" Meanwhile, Trump said on Wednesday that he wants the US military budget could raised to a record $1.5 trillion next year.\n\nBoth developments have implications for investors who have money in the defense sector, which is known for paying relatively high dividends. Lockheed Martin, for instance, has an annual dividend yield of around 2%, compared to about 1% for the broader S&P 500.\n\nHere's the rundown of how investors should be thinking about the latest news — and what it means for their portfolios.\n\nFor the most part, investors shouldn't be thinking about their long-term investments too differently. Trump's push to ban dividend payments seems largely hypothetical, and it's unclear how the president will enforce such a rule, said Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.\n\n\"It feels as though this was making another random social media announcement that will likely die on the vine,\" Hogan told Business Insider. \"I don't know you need to make a rush to judgment in terms of changing your long-term investment plans.\"\n\nBesides the threat of barring dividend payments, Trump's announcements on social media seem largely positive for defense investors, José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, said. He added that those who aren't dependent on dividend payments should remain invested in the sector, pointing to the potential for growth.\n\n\"I think that investors can look forward to improved quality from those companies, in the best-case scenario,\" he told BI.\n\nIf defense companies fall in line and pause dividend payments, that could hurt investors who specifically hold dividend-paying stocks for regular income, Torres said.\n\nBut those investors can move to other dividend-paying areas of the market. Torres encouraged investors to consider value sectors with high dividend yields, such as energy and healthcare.\n\nB. Riley's Hogan encouraged investors to consider areas like energy, consumer staples, pharmaceuticals, utilities, and other parts of the industrial sector, a broader umbrella that covers defense stocks.\n\nDividend ETFs, which track a basket of dividend-paying companies, are also an option for investors chasing dividends, he added.\n\n\"There's a lot of dividend darlings for sure,\" Hogan said. \"I think investors, if in fact they feel nervous about the potential for dividend cuts or the removal of dividends in any space, as unlikely as that prospect seems, there are ways to navigate around that.\"\n\nInvestors should be watching their bond investments, Peter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research, said.\n\nBerezin said that the significant increase in defense spending could lead to a rise in bond yields, which would mean bond prices could fall.\n\nInteractive Brokers' Torres also said he believed bond investors should \"absolutely\" be concerned about the more robust military budget, which could raise long-end bond yields in particular.\n\nLong-end bond yields have climbed in recent years as concerns have risen about the US deficit and rising levels of government debt. Higher debt levels make investors more wary of purchasing long-term US Treasurys, which means yields need to rise to attract investors. Heavy borrowing and spending are also inflationary, which could push yields higher down the road as the central bank adjusts monetary policy to keep prices under control.\n\nTorres didn't recommend selling bonds at the moment. He believes concerns around debt have caused long-end bond yields in the US to be \"too high,\" and he expects those yields to ease soon.\n\n\"I'm a bond bull at this juncture,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "The lightning U.S. operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro can be seen as both a benefit and a burden for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose forces botched an attempt to capture Ukraine’s capital and topple its leader at the start of Moscow's invasion nearly four years ago.\n\nThe ouster of Maduro highlights another Kremlin failure to support an ally, following the downfall of Syria’s former President Bashar Assad in 2024 and last year’s U.S. and Israeli attacks on Iran. With the U.S. determined to establish control over Venezuela, Russia stands to lose a strategic foothold in the Western Hemisphere, along with billions of dollars invested in its oil industry.\n\nBut President Donald Trump's actions in Venezuela also are causing unease in Western nations and giving the Kremlin fresh talking points to defend its war in Ukraine.\n\nIn addition, Trump’s interest in wresting control of Greenland from NATO ally Denmark also threatens to destabilize the alliance at the moment when the U.S.-led efforts to broker peace in Ukraine enter a pivotal stage, distracting its members from their efforts to support Kyiv and provide it with security guarantees.\n\nPutin himself hasn’t commented on the U.S. actions in Venezuela, which his diplomats have denounced as a blatant act of aggression. Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president who serves as his deputy on the presidential Security Council, similarly rebuked Washington for trampling international law — but also complimented Trump on defending U.S. interests.\n\n“Even though Trump’s action is completely unlawful, he cannot be denied a certain consistency — he and his team are very aggressively upholding their country’s national interests,” Medvedev said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. said it seized two sanctioned oil tankers linked to Venezuela, including one flagged to Russia in the North Atlantic.\n\nMoscow's ‘spheres of influence’\n\nSince 2014's illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula that followed the ouster of a pro-Kremlin president in Kyiv, Putin has sought to justify his action by describing his neighbor as part of Russia’s sphere of influence where Western encroachment can’t be allowed.\n\nPutin has argued that just as the U.S. would bristle at any foreign military presence in the Western Hemisphere, Russia sees NATO’s expansion to its borders as a major security threat. He cited Ukraine’s bid to join the military alliance as a key reason behind his full-scale invasion of the country.\n\n“We have made it clear and unambiguous that further eastward expansion of NATO is unacceptable,” Putin said shortly before sending troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. “Are we the ones placing missiles near the U.S. borders? No, it’s the U.S. that has brought its missiles to our doorstep.”\n\nLong before the invasion, Russia tested the ground on a possible deal under which it would refrain from meddling in Latin America in exchange for the U.S. offering Moscow free rein in Europe.\n\nFiona Hill, who oversaw Russia and Europe on Trump's National Security Council during his first term, testified before Congress in 2019 that the Russians were signaling their willingness to make such an arrangement involving Venezuela and Ukraine.\n\nRussia never made a formal offer, Hill told The Associated Press in an interview, but Moscow’s then-ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, “hinted ... many times” to her that Russia could cede its influence in Venezuela to the U.S. in exchange for a sphere of influence in Europe.\n\nShe said Trump's administration wasn’t interested in the Russian overtures that she described as a “hint-hint, nudge-nudge, wink-wink, how-about-doing-a-deal” offer. In April 2019, Hill was sent to Moscow to convey the message that “nobody’s interested. ... Ukraine and Venezuela are not related to each other.”\n\nHill said she did not know if the winds have now changed and whether there was any deal between the U.S. and Russia to swap spheres of influence in Venezuela and Ukraine, but she noted that many officials, including herself, who were involved in “restraining” Trump in his first term aren't around for his second.\n\nShe argued that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio would likely be the only member of the Trump administration who would now resist such a proposal, but added that others, including Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, could have a different view.\n\n“Who knows what Witkoff and others have been chatting about recently?” Hill asked.\n\nBefore Maduro was captured, AP reported Russia had started evacuating families of diplomats from Venezuela. When asked about the move, Hill said it would not be “implausible” that Witkoff gave Moscow a “courtesy heads-up.”\n\nSam Greene, a Russia expert at King’s College London, observed that Moscow may have backed down on Venezuela in the expectation of the U.S. giving it a free hand on Ukraine.\n\n“My worry is that it may be part of a tacit agreement, by which Washington, Moscow and Beijing agree not to deter one another against interventions in their putative spheres of influence,” he wrote on X.\n\nRussia’s foothold in Western Hemisphere\n\nBefore the invasion of Ukraine, senior Russian officials had issued vague warnings that Moscow could deploy troops or military assets to Cuba and Venezuela — statements that the U.S. dismissed as bluster. Some drew parallels to the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis — when the Soviet Union deployed missiles to Cuba and the U.S. imposed a naval blockade of the island.\n\nRussian-Cuban ties withered after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, plunging Cuba into a grueling depression. Soon after his first election in 2000, Putin ordered the closure of a Soviet-built military surveillance facility in Cuba as he sought to improve ties with Washington. As tensions with the U.S. and its allies mounted, however, Moscow again intensified trade and other contacts with Cuba and sent warships to visit the island.\n\nRussia also has invested heavily in Venezuela's oil industry, as did China, and offered Caracas generous loans to purchase top-of-the-line air defense missiles, fighter jets and other weapons. On several occasions, most recently in 2018, it dispatched its nuclear-capable Tu-160 bombers to Venezuela in a projection of force.\n\nMilitary experts have said, however, that any attempt by Russia to establish a permanent military foothold in the Western Hemisphere would face overwhelming logistical challenges.\n\nThe ‘might-makes-right’ doctrine\n\nThe U.S. seizure of Maduro and his wife was seen worldwide as the return of the “might- makes-right” doctrine, backing Moscow’s argument that its action in Ukraine protects its vital interests the way the U.S. did in Venezuela.\n\nAfter its action in Venezuela, the U.S. has “nothing to formally reproach our country for,” Medvedev noted.\n\nHill noted that Maduro’s capture makes it harder for countries to condemn Russia’s action in Ukraine because “we’ve just had a situation where the U.S. has taken over — or at least decapitated the government of another country — using fiction.”\n\nAn indictment accuses Maduro and others of working with drug cartels to facilitate the shipment of thousands of tons of cocaine into the U.S.\n\nFyodor Lukyanov, a Kremlin-connected, Moscow-based foreign policy expert, observed that “if we consider what’s happening from the perspective of setting a precedent, then we couldn’t ask for anything better, and this includes Trump’s conviction that the authorities in Venezuela must be approved by Washington.”\n\nRussian hawks, meanwhile, argue the U.S. action in Venezuela has created a new sense of urgency for Moscow to dramatically speed up its offensive in Ukraine.\n\n“Ukraine under our full control is our pass to the Great Powers club,” Alexander Dugin, a hard-line nationalist ideologue, wrote in a commentary.\n\nAP European Security Correspondent Emma Burrows in London contributed.",

Shares of top contractors clawed back losses from Wednesday's session spurred by Trump's statement that he would ban defense companies from issuing dividends and stock buybacks unless military production and maintenance are enhanced.\n\nHere were the big movers Thursday morning:\n\nThe White House declined to comment further.\n\nThe strength of the US military has long been a key focus for Trump, but his attention on the US military has sharpened after the US conducted its raid on Venezuela and captured the nation's president this month.

Also known as Yo Kitano, he has been banned from entering China. He told reporters that his arrival in Taiwan demonstrated the two are “different countries.”\n\n“I came to Taiwan … to prove this point, and to tell the world that Taiwan is an independent country,” Hei Seki said, according to Taiwan’s Central News Agency.\n\n“The nasty words of a petty villain like him are not worth commenting on,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning retorted when asked about his comment.\n\nMasaaki Kanai, head of Asia Oceanian Affairs at Japan's Foreign Ministry, urged China to scrap the trade curbs, saying a measure exclusively targeting Japan that deviates from international practice is unacceptable. Japan, however, has yet to announce any retaliatory measures.\n\nAs the two countries feuded, speculation rose that China might target rare earths exports to Japan, in a move similar to the rounds of critical minerals export restrictions it has imposed as part of its trade war with the United States.\n\nChina controls most of the global production of heavy rare earths, used for making powerful, heat-resistant magnets used in industries such as defense and electric vehicles.\n\nWhile the Commerce Ministry did not mention any new rare earths curbs, the official newspaper China Daily, seen as a government mouthpiece, quoted anonymous sources saying Beijing was considering tightening exports of certain rare earths to Japan. That report could not be independently confirmed.\n\nImproved South Korean ties contrast with Japan row\n\nAs Beijing spars with Tokyo, it has made a point of courting a different East Asian power — South Korea.\n\nOn Wednesday, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung wrapped up a four-day trip to China – his first since taking office in June. Lee and Chinese President Xi Jinping oversaw the signing of cooperation agreements in areas such as technology, trade, transportation and environmental protection.\n\nAs if to illustrate a contrast with the China-Japan trade frictions, Lee joined two business events at which major South Korean and Chinese companies pledged to collaborate.\n\nThe two sides signed 24 export contracts worth a combined $44 million, according to South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Resources.\n\nDuring Lee’s visit, Chinese media also reported that South Korea overtook Japan as the leading destination for outbound flights from China’s mainland over the New Year’s holiday.\n\nChina has been discouraging travel to Japan, saying Japanese leaders’ comments on Taiwan have created “significant risks to the personal safety and lives of Chinese citizens in Japan.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump abruptly changed his tone Wednesday about his Colombian counterpart, Gustavo Petro, saying they had exchanged a friendly phone call and he’d even invited the leader of the South American country to the White House.\n\n“It was a Great Honor to speak with the President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, who called to explain the situation of drugs and other disagreements that we have had,” Trump posted on his social media site. “I appreciated his call and tone, and look forward to meeting him in the near future.”\n\nHe wrote that the upcoming meeting would take place at the White House.\n\nThat came mere days after Trump said in the wake of the U.S. operation to oust Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend that “Colombia is very sick too” and accused Petro of ”making cocaine and selling it to the United States.\"\n\nIn comments to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump added of Petro, “He’s not going to be doing it very long, let me tell you.” Asked whether U.S. intervention was possible, Trump responded, ”Sounds good to me.”\n\nLater Wednesday, addressing thousands of protesters that he had mobilized to rally against U.S. military threats, Petro said he had spoken with Trump for roughly one hour.\n\n“I talked about two things: Venezuela and the issue of drug trafficking,” he told the crowd in downtown Bogotá, where demonstrators had just minutes earlier chanted slogans against the United States at Petro’s behest.\n\nPetro explained to the audience that Colombian politicians allegedly linked to narco-trafficking misled the U.S. president about Petro’s record to turn Trump against him.\n\n“Those (people) are responsible for this crisis — let’s call it diplomatic for now, verbal for now — that has erupted between the U.S. and Colombia,” he said.\n\nTrump now suddenly warming to Petro is especially surprising since Colombia’s president called the U.S. operation in Venezuela an “abhorrent” violation of Latin American sovereignty. He also suggested it was committed by “enslavers” and constituted a “spectacle of death” comparable to Nazi Germany’s 1937 carpet bombing of Guernica, Spain.\n\nColombia has long been among America’s staunchest Latin American allies, a pillar of Washington’s counternarcotics strategy abroad. For three decades, the U.S. has worked closely with Colombia, the world’s largest producer of cocaine, to arrest drug traffickers, fend off rebel groups and boost economic development in rural areas.\n\nStill, before Trump's conciliatory post, tensions had been rising between the U.S. and Colombia for months.\n\nThe Trump administration imposed sanctions in October on Petro, his family and a member of his government over accusations of involvement in the global drug trade. Colombia is considered the epicenter of the world’s cocaine trade.\n\nTrump began his monthslong pressure campaign on Maduro by ordering dozens of lethal strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats launched from Venezuela in the Caribbean. He eventually expanded the operations to also target suspected vessels in the eastern Pacific that came from Colombia.\n\nThe U.S. in September added Colombia, the top recipient of American assistance in the region, to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years. The designation led to a slashing of U.S. assistance to the country.\n\n“He has cocaine mills and cocaine factories,\" Trump said of Petro on Sunday. \"He’s not going to be doing it.”\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the spelling of the Colombian president's name.",

    "description": "-Mughrabi Jan 7 (Reuters) - Mohammad Sinwar, the elusive Hamas military chief in Gaza, had for months since the death of his brother, in 2024, been Israel's most wanted man.",
    "fullText": "Jan 7 (Reuters) - Mohammad Sinwar, the elusive Hamas military chief in Gaza, had for months since the death of his brother, in 2024, been Israel's most wanted man. On December 29, Hamas announced that he had died, aged 49, around seven months after Israel said it killed him in a strike.\n\nHamas did not provide details on Sinwar's death but ​said it mourned him along with other group leaders, describing them as \"heroic martyrs\". Hamas confirmed in the statement that Sinwar had been the head of the group's armed forces.\n\nSinwar was elevated ‌to the top ranks of Hamas in 2024 after the death in combat of his brother Yahya, mastermind of the October 2023 attack on Israel that led to the war in Gaza and later overall leader of the Palestinian organisation.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ‌in May 2025 that Sinwar had been killed. Less than two weeks later, the Israeli army said it had retrieved Sinwar's body in an underground tunnel beneath a hospital in southern Gaza.\n\nSinwar's death is expected to leave his next in command Izzeldeen Haddad, who had been overseeing operations in northern Gaza, in charge of Hamas' armed wing across the whole of the enclave.\n\nIt is unclear how the death will affect decision-making in Hamas more broadly - for example, whether it will bolster or diminish the influence of exiled members of the group's leadership council on policy matters, in particular the full implementation of the Gaza ceasefire plan agreed with Israel in October.\n\nHamas officials described ⁠Sinwar as a \"ghost\" who long outfoxed Israel's intelligence agencies.\n\nLike his brother Yahya, Sinwar ‌had survived many Israeli assassination attempts, including airstrikes and planted explosives, Hamas sources said.\n\nWhen Sinwar once visited a cemetery, his comrades discovered a remote-controlled explosive resembling a brick planted along his path, according to the Hamas sources.\n\nIn 2003, Hamas operatives discovered a bomb in the wall of Mohammad Sinwar's house, foiling an assassination attempt that the ‍group blamed on Israeli intelligence.\n\nKnown for clandestine operations, Mohammad Sinwar played a central role in planning and executing Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, the country's worst security failure, Hamas sources said.\n\nHe was also widely believed to have been one of the masterminds of the 2006 cross-border attack and abduction of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.\n\nHamas held Shalit for five years before he was swapped for more than 1,000 Palestinians jailed by Israel.\n\nUnder the deal, his brother Yahya Sinwar, whose ​meticulous planning for the 2023 attack shattered Israel's reputation as an invincible power in a hostile region, was among those who were released.\n\nNetanyahu has vowed to eradicate Hamas. The offensive against ‌Gaza by the Israeli Defence Forces, the Middle East's most advanced military, severely weakened the organisation.\n\nYahya Sinwar was killed in combat during a routine Israeli patrol in Gaza in 2024.\n\nIsrael released footage of a severely wounded Yahya Sinwar throwing a piece of wood at a hovering drone - his last act of defiance towards his old foe before his death and his brother's rise.\n\nBut the group, which was created during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation in 1987 and which carried out suicide bombings that traumatised Israelis in the second one, is still standing.\n\nBorn on September 16, 1975, Sinwar rarely appeared in public or spoke to the media. He granted a lengthy interview to Al Jazeera for a documentary broadcast in 2022, but wore a cap and sat in the dark to hide his appearance.\n\nThe Sinwars originally came from Asqalan - now the Israeli ⁠city of Ashkelon, a short distance to the north of the Gaza Strip. Alongside hundreds of thousands of other Palestinians, ​they became refugees in what they call the Nakba, or catastrophe, at the time of Israel's declaration of independence during the ​1948 war.\n\nThe family settled in Khan Younis in Gaza, which has been largely reduced to rubble in the latest war.\n\nMohammad Sinwar was educated in schools run by the United Nations' Palestinian relief agency (UNRWA), which has long been a target of Israeli criticism, including during the recent war in Gaza.\n\nHe joined Hamas shortly after its founding, influenced by his brother ‍Yahya, a former member of the Muslim Brotherhood, the ⁠oldest and at one time most influential Islamist group in the Middle East.\n\nHis reputation as a hardliner helped him rise through the group's military ranks. By 2005, he was leading Hamas' Khan Younis Brigade.\n\nThe unit, one of the largest and most powerful battalions in Hamas' armed wing, has been responsible for cross-border attacks, firing rockets and planting bombs along the frontier. “Striking Tel Aviv is easier than ⁠drinking water,\" Sinwar told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe unit also watches the movements of Israeli soldiers around the clock. In 2006, elite commandos led by Sinwar took part in Shalit's abduction.\n\nSources close to Hamas say Sinwar developed close ties with Marwan Issa, the deputy commander ‌of Hamas' military wing, and Mohammed Deif, the aloof military chief. Both men were killed by Israel in 2024.\n\nIn its statement announcing Sinwar's death on December 29, Hamas said that ‌he had succeeded Deif.",

It called the move \"absolutely unacceptable and deeply regrettable\" and said the measures targeted only Japan and that they \"deviate significantly from international practice.\"Johnson said Japan is unlikely to respond immediately but could retaliate if restrictions intensify, adding that other countries could potentially follow suit.",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran's army chief threatened preemptive military action Wednesday over the “rhetoric” targeting the Islamic Republic, likely referring to U.S. President Donald Trump's warning that if Tehran “violently kills peaceful protesters,” the United States “will come to their rescue.\"\n\nThe comments by Maj. Gen. Amir Hatami come as Iran tries to respond to what it sees as a dual threat posed by Israel and the United States, as well as the protests sparked by its economic woes that have grown into a direct challenge to its theocracy.\n\nSeeking to halt the anger, Iran's government began Wednesday paying the equivalent of $7 a month to subsidize rising costs for dinner table essentials like rice, meat and pastas. Shopkeepers warn prices for items as basic as cooking oil likely will triple under pressure from the collapse of Iran's rial currency and the end of a preferential subsidized dollar-rial exchange rate for importers and manufacturers — likely fueling further popular anger.\n\n“More than a week of protests in Iran reflects not only worsening economic conditions, but longstanding anger at government repression and regime policies that have led to Iran’s global isolation,” the New York-based Soufan Center think tank said.\n\nHatami spoke to military academy students. He took over as commander in chief of Iran's army, known by the Farsi word \"Artesh,\" after Israel killed a number of the country's top military commanders in June's 12-day war. He is the first regular military officer in decades to hold a position long controlled by Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.\n\n“The Islamic Republic considers the intensification of such rhetoric against the Iranian nation as a threat and will not leave its continuation without a response,\" Hatami said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency.\n\nHe added, “I can say with confidence that today the readiness of Iran’s armed forces is far greater than before the war. If the enemy commits an error, it will face a more decisive response, and we will cut off the hand of any aggressor.”\n\nIranian officials, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have been responding to Trump's comments, which took on more significance after the U.S. military raid that seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a longtime ally of Tehran, over the weekend. But there's been no immediate public sign of Iran preparing for an attack in the region.\n\nIranian state television reported on the start of a new subsidy of the equivalent of $7, put into the bank accounts of heads of households across the country. More than 71 million people will receive the benefit, which is 10 million Iranian rials, it reported. The rial now trades at over 1.4 million to $1 and continues to depreciate.\n\nThe subsidy is more than double than the 4.5 million rial people previously received. But already, Iranian media report sharp rises in the cost of basic goods, including cooking oil, poultry and cheese, placing additional strain on households already burdened by international sanctions targeting the country and inflation.\n\nIran's vice president in charge of executive affairs, Mohammad Jafar Ghaempanah, told reporters on Wednesday that the country was in a “full-fledged economic war.” He called for “economic surgery” to eliminate rentier policies and corruption within the country.\n\nIran has faced rounds of nationwide protests in recent years. As sanctions tightened and Iran struggled after the June war with Israel, its rial currency sharply fell in December. Protests began soon after on Dec. 28. They reached their 11th day on Wednesday and didn't appear to be stopping.\n\nSocial media videos purported to show new cities like Bojnourd, Kerman, Rasht, Shiraz and Tabriz, as well some smaller towns, joining the demonstrations on Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency offered the latest death toll of 36 for the demonstrations. It said 30 protesters, four children and two members of Iran’s security forces have been killed. Demonstrations have reached over 310 locations in 28 of Iran’s 31 provinces. More than 2,100 people have been arrested, it said.\n\nThe group, which relies on an activist network inside of Iran for its reporting, has been accurate in past unrest.",

    "fullText": "A preschool teacher was arrested on camera as soon as she finished a TV interview criticizing Donald Trump, fueling the debate over protest policing and free speech.\n\nJessica Plichta, 22, said she was the only person arrested among roughly 200 demonstrators at an anti-war protest in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Saturday, hours after Nicolas Maduro was detained in Caracas by the U.S. military.\n\nIn the broadcast footage, two officers could be seen approaching from behind as she wrapped her interview with WZZM, the city’s ABC affiliate, then escorted her away as she told them, “I am not resisting arrest.”\n\nWZZM said an officer cited “obstructing a roadway and failure to obey a lawful command,” and that Plichta had been charged with failure to obey a lawful command.\n\nPlichta later told Zeteo: “I don’t think it’s a coincidence that as soon as I finished an interview speaking on Venezuela, I was arrested.”\n\nShe told the outlet the officers shoved her into the back of a patrol car without fastening her seat belt, then drove a short distance down the street—out of view of cameras and bystanders.\n\nAccording to Plichta, they stopped again, pulled her out, bent her over the vehicle, patted her down, and took her belongings. She recalled one officer saying they moved her because she was “making a scene.”\n\nShe also said officers repeatedly pressed her on whether she was Venezuelan, what her connection to Venezuela was, and why she had attended the protest. Plichta claimed they tried to get her to identify other demonstrators.\n\n“We are so accustomed to, and used to, repression when we speak out on anti-war topics. When we speak out for Venezuela, when we speak out for Palestine, we expect the police to want to shut that down,” she told Zeteo.\n\n“It just shows how much they feel they can get away with things, how easy it is for them to isolate people from the public eye when they’re doing this.”\n\nPlichta said she largely stayed quiet as officers took her to jail, where she said the same questions continued. She was released about three hours later after other protesters gathered to demand she be freed and was seen punching the air in a video shared on Facebook.\n\nThe Grand Rapids Police Department disputed her claims in a statement to the Daily Beast.\n\nA spokesperson said more than “25 announcements were made from the PA system of a marked police cruiser for the group [of protesters] to leave the roadway and relocate their activities to the sidewalk,” but that they had “refused lawful orders” to move to the sidewalk and “began blocking intersections.”\n\nAdding that supervisors told officers they could arrest anyone who could be “positively identified,” the spokesperson confirmed only one arrest was made. The Beast followed up to ask why only Plichta had been arrested, but had not received a response at the time of publication.\n\nThe mayor of Grand Rapids is David LaGrand, a Democrat.\n\nThe incident came to light as Trump, 79, tries to sell the Maduro operation at home, despite signs of public unease.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released Monday found about one in three Americans approve of the U.S. strike, while 72 percent worry the U.S. will become too involved.\n\nIt is also a small part of a much larger information war that has even seen Trump amplify mislabeled footage on Truth Social to claim mass celebrations after the Maduro capture—a video that fact-checkers traced to an unrelated 2024 protest.",

    "fullText": "Deal indicates Venezuelan government is responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention\n\nDonald Trump has said Venezuela will be “turning over” $2bn worth of Venezuelan crude to the United States, a flagship negotiation that would divert supplies from China while helping Venezuela avoid deeper oil production cuts.\n\n“This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!” Trump said in a post online.\n\nVenezuelan government officials and state company PDVSA did not provide comment.\n\nVenezuela has millions of barrels of oil loaded on tankers and in storage tanks that it has been unable to ship due to the blockade imposed by Trump, as part of the pressure campaign that culminated in the toppling of Nicolás Maduro who was seized from his country by US forces over the weekend.\n\nTop Venezuelan officials have called Maduro’s capture a kidnapping and accused the US of trying to steal the country’s vast oil reserver, however Tuesday’s agreement is a strong sign that the government is responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention.\n\nTrump has said he wants interim president Delcy Rodríguez to give the US and private companies “total access” to Venezuela’s oil industry.\n\nUS energy secretary Chris Wright is in charge of executing the deal, Trump said, adding that the oil will be taken from ships and sent directly to US ports. Supplying the trapped crude to the US could initially require reallocating cargoes originally bound for China, two sources had told Reuters earlier on Tuesday.\n\nChina has been Venezuela’s top buyer in the last decade and especially since the United States imposed sanctions on companies involved in oil trade with Venezuela in 2020.\n\nUS crude prices fell more than 1.5% after Trump’s announcement, with the agreement expected to increase the volume of Venezuelan oil exported to the US. That flow of oil is currently controlled entirely by Chevron, PDVSA’s main joint venture partner, under a US authorisation.\n\nChevron, which has been exporting between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan oil to the US, is the only company that has been loading and shipping crude without interruption from the South American country in recent weeks under the blockade.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Venezuela would have any access to proceeds from the supply. Sanctions mean PDVSA is excluded from the global financial system, its bank accounts are frozen and it is blocked from executing transactions in US dollars\n\nHours before Trump’s announcement on Tuesday, Rodríguez hardened her tone against the US, saying in a televised address that “no external agent governs Venezuela” – a clear rebuttal to the US president’s claim that, after the capture of Maduro, the US would now run the South American country.\n\nIt marked another shift in tone from Maduro’s former vice-president. After being sworn in as president by Venezuela’s supreme court on Saturday, Rodríguez released a conciliatory statement late on Sunday in which she “invited the US government to work together on an agenda of cooperation”.\n\nIn Tuesday’s address, however, Rodríguez reverted to harsher language, describing Saturday’s strike – the first large-scale US military operation on South American soil – as a “terrible military aggression” and a “criminal attack” whose “absolutely illegal outcome, in violation of international law”, was the “kidnapping” of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.\n\n“We are a people who do not surrender, who do not give up, and we are here, governing together with the people. The government of Venezuela rules in our country – no one else. There is no external agent governing Venezuela. It is Venezuela, its constitutional government, and the consolidated power of the people,” said Rodríguez, who had served as Maduro’s vice-president since 2018.",
