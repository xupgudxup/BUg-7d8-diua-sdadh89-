    "fullText": "Anthropic's CEO is prepared to walk away from its contract with the military, according to a new statement published on Thursday.\n\nIn a blog post, CEO Dario Amodei said that the company \"cannot in good conscience accede\" to the request of the Defense Department concerning safeguards around its frontier model, Claude.\n\nOn Tuesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave Anthropic an ultimatum to agree with the military's terms over the use of Claude or get blacklisted by the government.\n\nDefense officials gave Anthropic until Friday evening to agree to the terms.\n\nThe terms were not clarified, but the issue, according to Amodei's statement, appears to revolve around two red lines Anthropic is not willing to cross when it comes to how Claude is deployed: mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons.\n\nA spokesperson for Anthropic declined to comment.\n\nHours before Amodei put out a statement, Sean Parnell, a Pentagon spokesperson, posted on X that the department had no interest in using AI to conduct mass surveillance of US citizens or to develop autonomous weapons.\n\nA person familiar with the negotiations told Business Insider the department provided a new proposal just 36 hours before Hegseth's deadline, and the language around the provisions on mass surveillance and autonomous weapons allowed for \"any lawful use\" of Anthropic's AI.\n\nThe person said that the additions essentially gave the military to discretion to set aside Anthropic's red lines and use Claude as it sees fit.\n\nA senior Pentagon official told Business Insider on Tuesday that the department will consider invoking the Defense Production Act — a wartime law that would essentially give the president control over Anthropic's resources in the interest of national security — and deem the company a supply chain risk.\n\nBoth uses of the national authorities would be unprecedented, experts told Business Insider, considering that the levers are being used as a negotiating tactic and against an American company.\n\n\"I'm not aware of this ever having been used as a weapon in a negotiating posture,\" Dean Ball, an ex-senior policy advisor for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, told Business Insider.\n\nAmodei wrote in the blog post that the two threats are \"inherently contradictory: one labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security.\"\n\nThe CEO wrote that Anthropic hopes the government will \"reconsider\" its position on the safeguards and that the company's preference is to continue working with the military.\n\n\"Should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions,\" Amodei wrote.",

    "description": "A top Norwegian military official identified icebreakers as one of the capability gaps that exist between NATO and Russia and China.",
    "fullText": "NATO forces are falling behind Russia and China in the race to build icebreakers, ships that would be crucial in an Arctic war, a top Norwegian military official told Business Insider.\n\nIn an interview, Vice Adm. Rune Andersen, chief of the Norwegian Joint Headquarters, identified icebreakers as one of the key capability gaps that exist between NATO and its rivals in the Arctic.\n\nRussia and China are the only two countries that are building icebreakers at scale. The West has been \"falling behind\" in its ability to operate fully in the Arctic compared to Moscow and Beijing, Andersen said last week.\n\nRussia has dozens of icebreakers — roughly 40 by some estimates, far more than any other country — while China, which has increased its Arctic activity in recent years, fields around five. Moscow and Beijing plan to work together to expand that fleet.\n\nThe US, by contrast, fields just one heavy polar icebreaker along with a number of smaller vessels. The Trump administration said last year that the US Coast Guard's fleet of Arctic-capable vessels is \"insufficient to meet current operations demands and presents a national security risk.\" The president also called for a dramatic boost to the overall size of the fleet.\n\nArctic security has become a growing focal point for NATO in recent years as Russian and Chinese activity expands. Increased competition has spotlighted the icebreaker gap.\n\nThese ships, which are purpose-built to crush ice blocking waterways, are critical in this region because they enable better movement across frozen yet strategic terrain, unlocking access to trade routes and natural resources. In a fight, they allow access to the battlespace, as well as enable logistics and support missions.\n\nCanada, Finland, and other NATO allies add dozens of icebreakers to the Western alliance's ice-breaking arsenal, bringing it closer to parity with Russia, but Arctic experts believe nearly a third of them are past their design life. Russia's fleet is heavier and more specialized, built for heavy-ice operations in ways that many alliance vessels aren't.\n\nA NATO official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss military capabilities, told Business Insider that while Russia may have more of certain maritime platforms than the West, the country still faces readiness challenges that affect its ability to put ships to sea.\n\nThis creates \"strategic dilemmas with their force projection,\" the official said.\n\nAndersen said NATO countries have acknowledged the numerical deficit in icebreakers and are making strides to close the gap.\n\nThe Trump administration, for instance, said in October that it plans to order four Arctic Security Cutters, medium icebreaking ships, from Finland and build another seven in American shipyards using Finnish expertise.\n\nThe Coast Guard assesses that it needs at least nine of those ships \"to serve our national security needs year-round in the Arctic,\" the White House said at the time.\n\nFinland is the world leader in icebreaker production. Its companies have designed 80% of the world's icebreakers, and its local shipyards have built 60% of them. Other leading countries include Canada, Russia, and China.\n\nCmdr. Arlo Abrahamson, a spokesperson for NATO's Allied Maritime Command, told Business Insider that member states \"are making tangible investments in icebreakers.\"\n\n\"Our collective capabilities provide allied navies and coast guards the ability to operate in Arctic conditions,\" he added.\n\nBeyond the icebreakers, NATO allies are investing in other technologies and systems to improve their Arctic foothold, including additional surveillance capabilities, drones, satellites, and vehicles that can withstand cold temperatures.\n\nWestern forces have also increased the scale of their Arctic exercises to familiarize soldiers with the harsh terrain and launched new deterrence operations to strengthen their posture across the region.",

An F-4 fighter jet crashed near Iran's western city of Hamedan, killing one of its pilots.\n\nIran has a history of fatal crashes.

    "description": "The gap between Russia and the West has pushed Moscow to prioritize unconventional capabilities, a top Norwegian military official said.",
    "fullText": "Russia is betting on its submarines and experimental nuclear weapons to make up for the smaller military force that it fields compared to NATO, a top Norwegian military official told Business Insider.\n\nThat \"inherent asymmetry\" between the Russian armed forces and the militaries of the 32-member NATO alliance, which enjoys far greater conventional strength, has pushed Moscow to prioritize more unconventional capabilities, said Vice Adm. Rune Andersen, chief of the Norwegian Joint Headquarters.\n\n\"It's a wide set of challenges that we are up against,\" he said in an interview last week.\n\nRussia, estimated to have over 1.1 million active-duty troops, less than the US alone with 1.3 million troops, is suffering heavy losses in Ukraine that can't easily be replenished. British intelligence said Moscow has suffered 1.2 million casualties in the war. Western estimates say it's barely breaking even on adding new troops to its ranks.\n\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said 65,000 soldiers were killed across December and January, and US assessments put Moscow's recruitment numbers at 30,000-40,000 a month. Rutte has said that these losses aren't sustainable.\n\nRussian equipment losses have been staggering as well. Ukraine has damaged or destroyed dozens of warships, hundreds of aircraft, and thousands of armored vehicles.\n\nWhile Russia falls short of NATO's conventional strength, especially considering its ongoing losses in Ukraine, alliance military leaders still view Moscow as a threat, particularly its asymmetric capabilities. One such area is its submarine force, Andersen said.\n\nRussia has one of the world's largest submarine fleets, with over 60 boats, some of which are capable of launching ballistic and nuclear-tipped missiles.\n\nAndersen said that Russia can't compete with NATO's integrated surface fleet, equipped with advanced warships and aircraft carriers, so the country is prioritizing underwater capabilities as a way to gain an advantage over the West.\n\n\"Submarines are inherently asymmetric. Underwater is the last place on earth where you can hide,\" Andersen said, adding that NATO forces are highly focused on ensuring that they can secure control of the sub-surface domain.\n\nCmdr. Arlo Abrahamson, a spokesperson for NATO's Allied Maritime Command, told Business Insider that Russia regularly deploys submarines to the Arctic and High North.\n\nHe said that NATO closely tracks this activity; 14 member states operate their own submarines, and the alliance is collectively focused on strengthening its anti-submarine capabilities.\n\nHowever, while NATO \"has significant and broad capabilities with submarines,\" Abrahamson stressed that \"we don't underestimate the capabilities of our adversaries.\"\n\nRussia is also developing weapons systems, some of which are tested in the Arctic, as part of its investments in asymmetric warfare. Two experimental munitions that Andersen identified in the interview are a cruise missile and a nuclear torpedo.\n\nRussian officials disclosed in October that Moscow had tested its nuclear-powered 9M730 Burevestnik cruise missile and autonomous Poseidon torpedo, both of which are intended as second-strike capabilities.\n\nRussia said the Burevestnik, which NATO identifies as the SSC-X-9 Skyfall, flew 8,700 miles and traveled in the air for 15 hours, while the Poseidon launched from a submarine using a boost motor and activated its nuclear power unit to propel it forward.\n\nThe weapons are two of six experimental \"super weapons\" that were unveiled in 2018 by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Moscow has touted the missile and torpedo as being unlimited in range and able to bypass defenses.\n\nThe other weapons in the mix include the Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile, the Zircon ship-launched hypersonic cruise missile, the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle, and the Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile. All are able to carry a nuclear warhead.\n\nSome of these weapons have already been used against Ukraine, frequently not living up to the hype. However, their development represents continued investment in Moscow's nuclear capabilities.\n\n\"You could argue, given that Russia is conventionally bogged down in Ukraine and might come out weakened after the war in Ukraine, that the nuclear weapons are relatively more important to Russia as the core element of any big power ambitions they might have,\" Andersen said.",

    "description": "Military watchdog report reveals widespread canine welfare problems at military kennels across the country.",
    "fullText": "Four military working dogs died between 2021 and 2023 after being housed in deteriorating kennels, according to a new Pentagon watchdog report. Dozens of others suffered injuries or disease or showed signs of severe stress.\n\nThe report from the Defense Department's Inspector General's office, released Thursday, revealed failures to protect dogs from extreme weather, a lack of canine engagement, staffing shortages, and widespread facility decay across 12 base kennels.\n\nMilitary working dogs play important roles in explosive detection and security missions, making their health a readiness issue as well as an animal welfare concern.\n\nInvestigators reported deficiencies across all bases they assessed, but the most serious lapses in health and welfare were at the Air Force's 341st Training Squadron at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, Texas, the military's de facto canine program headquarters, which oversees the acquisition and basic training for all military dogs.\n\nNone of the 230 dogs at the facility received the five hours of daily play and engagement required by military policy. Instead, they were walked three or four times a week for about 10 minutes, spending most of their time confined to small kennels. Nearly two dozen at the base suffered heat injuries. Investigators observed widespread stress behaviors, including repetitive spinning in tight circles and chewing on metal bowls.\n\nThe report attributed problems at San Antonio-Lackland partly to staff shortages and identified higher rates of diseases, injuries, and behavioral problems there than at other military canine facilities.\n\nOther bases reported outbreaks among their own canines after dogs from San Antonio-Lackland transferred to new facilities, arriving with skin disorders, histories of heat injuries, and spreading a gastrointestinal parasite known to thrive in areas not adequately disinfected of feces. Shoddy quarantine procedures and poor sanitation contributed to the spread of illnesses, the report said.\n\nWhile San Antonio-Lackland facility fared the worst, investigators found serious deficiencies at every base they visited during the inquiry.\n\n\"The DoD MWD Program Manager and Service Components did not consistently protect DoD MWDs from extreme weather conditions and kennel mold issues, or manage quarantine and isolation areas for DoD MWDs,\" the report said, using the acronym for military working dogs.\n\nAccording to the report, chronic underfunding and deferred maintenance exacerbated poor conditions. Many dogs remain housed in \"aging and unsatisfactory kennel facilities,\" which contributed to the four deaths and ongoing health and behavioral problems.\n\nThe Office of the Secretary of Defense referred Business Insider to the Air Force, which did not respond to request for comment prior to publication.\n\nResearch shows behavioral issues are common in kennels, said Robert Dougherty, a retired police canine handler who now oversees the University of Pennsylvania's Working Dog Center as the law enforcement canine program director. However, some facilities are worse than others.\n\n\"Depression is a real thing in dogs,\" he told Business Insider after reviewing the report. \"To sit around in a kennel and do nothing, either physically or mentally, is unacceptable, really.\"\n\nSimply increasing activity with longer walks or games of fetch isn't enough to address stress and behavioral issues in most high-drive working breeds, Dougherty said. These dogs need structured programs that challenge them mentally and physically while also minimizing injury risk. At his center, that means combining games, strength training, and even canine yoga.\n\nHealth problems impact how long a dog can serve — a 2025 study by Army veterinarians found that nearly 84% of working dogs discharged between 2019 and 2021 left early due to neuromusculoskeletal disease, heat injuries, or fear and anxiety.\n\nIn its response to investigators, the Air Force said it has received nearly $170 million for structural improvements and staffing hires.\n\nPrevious watchdog reports have raised similar concerns about military dog welfare. More recently, military equine programs came under heavy scrutiny following a string of neglect-related deaths at Arlington National Cemetery's ceremonial equine unit. The Army shut that program down for two years while it underwent a significant overhaul and later moved to disband some equine units following a broader review.\n\nSubstandard living conditions have also plagued human troops, prompting years of scrutiny over mold, sewage failures, and deteriorating barracks, though the Pentagon has recently launched various initiatives to repair and replace some facilities.",

    "fullText": "Feb 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is curious as to why Iran has not yet \"capitulated\" and agreed to curb its nuclear programme, as Washington builds up its military capability ‌in the Middle East, Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said.\n\n\"I don't want to use the ‌word 'frustrated,' because he understands he has plenty of alternatives, but he's curious as to why they haven't... I don't want to use ​the word 'capitulated,' but why they haven't capitulated,\" Witkoff said during an interview on Saturday with Fox News' \"My View with Lara Trump,\" hosted by the president's daughter-in-law.\n\n\"Why, under this pressure, with the amount of seapower and naval power over there, why haven't they come to us and said, 'We profess we don't want a weapon, so here's ‌what we're prepared to do'? And ⁠yet it's sort of hard to get them to that place.\"\n\nTrump has ordered a huge buildup of forces in the Middle East and preparations for a potential multi-week ⁠air attack on Iran. Iran has threatened to strike U.S. bases if it is attacked.\n\nIRAN DENIES SEEKING NUCLEAR WEAPONS\n\nThe United States wants Iran to give up enriched uranium which Washington says can potentially be used to make a ​bomb, as ​well as stop supporting militants in the Middle East ​and accept limits to its missile programme.\n\nTehran ‌says its nuclear programme is peaceful but it is willing to accept some curbs on it in return for the lifting of financial sanctions. It rejects tying this to other issues such as missiles and support for armed groups.\n\n\"They've been enriching well beyond the number that you need for civil nuclear. It's up to 60% (fissile purity),\" Witkoff said. \"They're probably a week away from having industrial, industrial-grade bomb-making material, and that's really ‌dangerous.\"\n\nA senior Iranian official told Reuters on Sunday that Iran ​and the United States still have differing views over sanctions relief ​in talks.\n\nWitkoff also said he has met ​at Trump's direction with Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi, son of the shah ousted ‌in Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. He did ​not provide further details of ​the meeting.\n\nPahlavi, who lives in exile, served as a rallying figure for some of Iran's opposition during anti-government demonstrations last month in which thousands of people are believed to have been killed, ​the worst domestic unrest since the ‌revolution era.\n\nEarlier in February, Pahlavi said U.S. military intervention in Iran could save lives, and ​urged Washington not to spend too long negotiating with Tehran's clerical rulers on a nuclear ​deal.",

    "description": "The Marines' top Sergeant Major wants companies to start hiring more troops before they leave the military.",
    "fullText": "The Marine Corps' top enlisted leader wants government agencies and civilian companies to start recruiting Marines for new jobs long before troops leave the military, arguing that delays in hiring can leave veterans vulnerable at a critical moment.\n\nSpeaking during a congressional hearing on service member quality of life last week, Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps Carlos Ruiz said he wants to see agencies such as the Secret Service, as well as industries like shipbuilding and emergency responders, begin hiring processes up to a year before Marines separate.\n\n\"The in-between time when the paychecks run out, when the medical gets expensive and life hits them, I worry,\" Ruiz told lawmakers, referring broadly to data showing veterans are often most vulnerable to mental health issues soon after leaving the military. \"Build a pipeline where a Marine can go straight from the last day of active duty to your school,\" he said, referring to employee training. \"Eliminate the barriers.\"\n\nEach year, around 200,000 service members leave active duty, first attending the congressionally mandated Transition Readiness Program, designed to help troops learn how to apply for civilian jobs or universities. About 14% of those transitioning are Marines.\n\nPrevious oversight reports have found consistent shortfalls with that program. A 2023 government watchdog report found that a quarter of troops who needed the most transition support never received it, and 70% did not begin the process a year before separation, leaving many scrambling for civilian opportunities.\n\n\"That's the thing that I think is maybe the source of a downhill spiral towards negativity,\" Ruiz explained to Business Insider in a video interview after the hearing, linking delayed employment to broader mental health concerns.\n\nWhile many Marines transition successfully, others struggle. Some studies estimate that more than 40% of veterans leave their first post-military job within a year. The VA's latest suicide report shows veterans from the Corps, where tight-knit camaraderie is prized, face the highest risk of suicide within a year of exiting relative to other services.\n\nRuiz argued that speeding up and smoothing the hiring process could help reduce that early instability.\n\nFor example, he said, the Secret Service can have an 18-month application period for applicants, even as the agency works to expand its ranks amid an injection of cash.\n\n\"You want Marines. I want you to have Marines. You got to come to the left,\" Ruiz said, referring to a quicker hiring timeline. He recalled a conversation with Secret Service director Sean Curran last month. \"I will give you access to them throughout the years that they're in the Marine Corps, so we can move that date to the left, so they can transition straight in.'\n\n\"That's a lot of time in between for life to happen,\" Ruiz said.\n\nThe Secret Service is trying to shorten its lengthy hiring process by condensing qualifying events — like polygraphs and various exams — for applicants, Nate Herring, an agency spokesperson, said in an email to Business Insider. Herring cited an aggressive push to recruit more veterans and reduce hiring bureaucracy, too, in some cases cutting the process by six months.\n\nRather than waiting until Marines exit active duty to begin lengthy application processes and hit unexpected chokepoints, Ruiz wants employers to move hiring timelines sooner, starting any additional background checks, interviews, and paperwork during a Marine's final year of service, including while deployed.\n\nSuch a shift would require buy-in from the service's middle-management ranks, who may be reluctant to let subordinates spend more time on job searches, a challenge not usually well-understood throughout the active ranks, though often felt by those leaving.\n\nA 2020 Department of Veterans Affairs report found that \"many veterans did not understand the magnitude of the issues they might face when transitioning to civilian life.\"\n\nRuiz also floated the idea of formal partnerships between the Marine Corps and private-sector employers, including Big Tech companies, from the time a recruit enters the Corps, that would guarantee job placement for selected Marines upon completing their enlistment, provided they meet agreed-upon benchmarks.\n\nSuch early partnerships could offer recruits and families greater career stability and more predictability. Many recruits already join the military planning to stay for one or two tours and use their service as an important stepping stone.\n\nShipbuilding, a priority industry for the Trump administration and one that is grappling with persistent workforce shortages and pay challenges, could also benefit from a more direct Marine-to-industry pipeline, Ruiz said.\n\n\"You want Marines, you want this kind of work ethic, you want this kind of passion,\" he said of similar industries. \"Then build the pipeline, build an incentive package that's worth their talents, and I think they'll come no matter where you are.\"\n\nSome career fields have programs in place already to help troops quickly land in suitable career fields. But those existing efforts, including those within the civilian sector, generally fall short.\n\n\"It's not good enough,\" he said. \"You're taking too long, and we can be better.\"",

    "description": "NATO needs to use this time to prepare for a Russian resurgence in the Arctic, a top Norwegian military official told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "Russian forces pulled from the Arctic to fight in Ukraine have suffered heavy losses on the battlefield, but NATO expects them to eventually rebuild, emerging as a \"dangerous\" challenge, a top Norwegian military official told Business Insider.\n\nVice Adm. Rune Andersen, chief of the Norwegian Joint Headquarters, said there is no \"clear and immediate military threat\" from Russia in the north right now. But, he warned, Moscow has plans to rebuild and expand their military once the fight in Ukraine ends.\n\n\"We are preparing for a more dangerous Russia,\" he said, adding that NATO needs to use this time well and make preparations.\n\nArctic security has become an important issue for the NATO alliance in recent years, as Western officials have grown increasingly concerned about Russia's expanded military footprint in the strategic region.\n\nNATO leadership has called for greater investment in Arctic defense to counter Russian — and, more recently, Chinese — activity. Allied countries are increasingly taking steps to strengthen their posture in the High North, including through new deterrence operations.\n\nDespite rising tensions between Russia and NATO, an Arctic conflict does not appear imminent, as Moscow remains focused on its war in Ukraine — a campaign that has come at tremendous cost.\n\nRussia has pulled most of its forces from the strategic Kola Peninsula — a large swath of territory near Finland and a hub for its military and nuclear power in the Arctic — and sent them to Ukraine, where a lot of their troops have been killed in combat, Andersen said.\n\n\"Russia is bogged down in Ukraine,\" he added.\n\nExperts at the RAND Corporation, a US global policy think tank, said in a report this week that Russia's decision to deploy resources from the High North to Ukraine has ultimately led to \"the hollowing out of the country's Arctic-capable ground units.\"\n\n\"The conclusion of hostilities in Ukraine would allow Russia to reinvest in its military posture in the High North,\" they said.\n\nRussia's Arctic force presence has long been a concern for countries like Norway, where the threat is directly at their doorstep.\n\nIn the 2000s, Russia began returning to some Soviet-era Arctic bases, refurbishing airstrips and reopening facilities that had been closed during or after the Cold War, and in the late 2010s, Moscow launched more active submarine deployments from the Kola Peninsula, Andersen said.\n\nRussia has also deployed missile defense systems, increased its aerial and maritime patrols, and ramped up its military exercises, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a US think tank that tracks Arctic military activity.\n\nWhile Russia's Arctic forces have taken a beating in Ukraine, leaving it less prepared in the region, NATO military planners are still acutely aware that there is potential for conflict down the road and are prepping for such a scenario.\n\n\"We are now in a time where we have an opportunity to focus on strengthening ourselves,\" Andersen said.\n\nNATO allies are investing in technology and systems to help secure the Arctic, including additional surveillance capabilities, icebreakers, drones, satellites, and vehicles that can operate in the cold.\n\nAllies have also expanded their footprint and increased the scale of their exercises in the Arctic to familiarize soldiers with the harsh realities of fighting so far north, where temperatures can kill just as easily as the enemy, and supply lines are vast and fragmented.\n\nNext month, for instance, thousands of NATO troops will participate in the biennial Cold Response drills in northern Norway, which are designed to train soldiers for high-intensity combat operations in the Arctic. These would be crucial skills for Western forces if Russia eventually reinvests in its capabilities across the High North.\n\n\"You need to train here to be able to fight here,\" Andersen said. \"In practical terms, it is those troops who have that training and that equipment who are relevant in the Arctic.\"",

    "title": "Thousands of military families are stuck on childcare waitlists. More spots may not be enough to fix the deeper problems.",
    "description": "The military childcare waitlist affects thousands of families, highlighting gaps in support for working spouses and service members.",
    "fullText": "There are an estimated 7,800 children on US military childcare waitlists. Military families and advocates say the number masks deeper shortfalls that continue to sideline working spouses and strain service members.\n\nLawmakers raised the issue during a recent congressional hearing, calling the persistent backlog a quality-of-life problem, even as the waitlist has notably dropped from 12,000 children in 2024.\n\nAdvocates told Business Insider that the number isn't the whole picture and excludes families who've given up out of frustration or can't use base centers that lack evening, weekend, or specialized care.\n\n\"We can't say that we are a military that cares about our families if we pretend to provide childcare and then we've got a waitlist that's got 7,800 babies waiting on it,\" Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren said to service senior enlisted leaders during last week's hearing.\n\nNone of the service leaders present disputed that figure.\n\nMaster Chief Petty Officer of the Navy John Perryman acknowledged that the Navy still has roughly 1,400 children in unmet need status, while Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force David Wolfe said his service's waitlist stands at around 2,700, though there are efforts underway to open new spots.\n\nIt is not clear how the remaining waitlisted children are divided between other services.\n\nIn 2022, the Air Force had 95,000 children under 5 but space for only about 23,000 in its child development centers, a 2023 service report on childcare found.\n\nAn Air Force spokesperson attributed that disparity to the number of children entering and leaving care throughout the year. \"The annual number served will not correlate with daily capacity and can be significantly higher,\" they said.\n\nNot all families require on-base care. But the report added that more facility construction alone would not be a \"viable solution to meet all potential demand.\"\n\nKayla Corbitt, a military spouse and the founder of a nonprofit dedicated to helping military families find reliable childcare, told Business Insider that many families lose hope amid long waits. Staying on the waitlist, she said, requires logging on every couple of months to reconfirm before families are automatically disenrolled.\n\nAnd for some families, the barriers extend beyond backlogs.\n\n\"Anyone needing evening care, weekend care, shift work care, which is a lot of the military, they aren't going to try to get on that waitlist,\" Corbitt said, explaining that most child development centers, or CDCs, on bases don't offer late evening or very early morning care needed for troops on 24-hour duty or for deployed service members with spouses who work unusual hours.\n\nAdditionally, children with special needs face significant obstacles in finding care, Corbitt said, as many CDCs are not equipped to provide care, and the policies sometimes vary from facility to facility, making it hard for families to know what to expect when they move.\n\nBrigit Schneider, an Air Force spouse and mother of three children, wants to return to work as a financial planner to better support her family, but because her local childcare center won't accept children with feeding tubes, one of her young children is shut out.\n\n\"From a special needs mom perspective, it's an extra layer of challenge,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nSchneider pays nearly $1,000 a month for one child to receive on-base childcare, another child is receiving private care due to the severity of their disability, and a third is at home. Schneider says the third should be able to receive base care.\n\n\"A G-tube really is not a hard medical device to learn how to use,\" she said.\n\nGenerally, though, military CDCs won't accept children with gastrostomy tubes. Facilities are often unable, or unwilling, to provide higher levels of care, Corbitt said.\n\nAir Force childcare programs are \"supported by a multidisciplinary team of experts who provide consultation and support to ensure the highest quality of inclusive care,\" an Air Force spokesperson told Business Insider following a query regarding the service's childcare.\n\nThe service \"offers a network of on- and off-installation care options and works closely with families to identify the appropriate setting for their child,\" said the spokesperson, adding that waitlist data helps inform future allocation requirements.\n\nStaffing shortages are another obstacle to reliable access for military personnel. Military childcare workers face unusually high attrition rates, around 50%, Warren said at last week's congressional hearing, driven largely by meager pay.\n\nCompounding the issue is the lack of a clear pathway that would allow qualified providers to move easily between states.\n\nNearly 40% of childcare workers are military spouses, said the Marine Corps' top enlisted leader, Sergeant Major Carlos Ruiz, during the hearing. \"If we can just be a little bit more smart about transferring folks and directly hiring from one CDC to another, we can reduce the attrition,\" he said.\n\nGovernment watchdogs have repeatedly flagged childcare accessibility as a point of concern for the US military. A 2024 Government Accountability Office report found that while the services focus heavily on recruiting new childcare workers, they do not consistently measure whether employee retention efforts are effective.\n\nThe military's childcare shortages aren't unique to the armed forces. Many Americans in the civilian world struggle to find reliable, reasonably priced childcare.\n\nOften, a year of childcare amounts to an entire average salary, costing tens of thousands of dollars. The cost of childcare in the US has increased by over 150% over the last quarter-century and continues to climb, often outpacing inflation. In some areas, childcare costs can exceed rent or mortgage payments.",

    "description": "The Pentagon and the Energy Department for the first time airlifted a small nuclear reactor from California to Utah, demonstrating what they say is the U.S. potential to quickly deploy nuclear power f...",
    "fullText": "HILL AIR FORCE BASE, Utah (AP) — The Pentagon and the Energy Department for the first time airlifted a small nuclear reactor from California to Utah, demonstrating what they say is the U.S. potential to quickly deploy nuclear power for military and civilian use.\n\nThe nearly 700-mile flight last weekend — which transported a 5-megawatt microreactor without nuclear fuel — highlights the Trump administration’s drive to promote nuclear energy to help meet skyrocketing demand for power from artificial intelligence and data centers, as well as for use by the military.\n\nEnergy Secretary Chris Wright and Undersecretary of Defense Michael Duffey, who traveled with the privately built reactor, hailed the Feb. 15 trip on a C-17 military aircraft as a breakthrough for U.S. efforts to fast-track commercial licensing for the microreactors, part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to reshape the country's energy landscape.\n\nPresident Donald Trump supports nuclear power — a carbon-free source of electricity — as a reliable energy source, even as he has been broadly hostile to renewable energy and prioritizes coal and other fossil fuels to produce electricity.\n\nSkeptics warn that nuclear energy poses risks and say microreactors may not be safe or feasible and have not proved they can meet demand for a reasonable price.\n\nWright brushed those concerns aside as he touted progress on Trump’s push for a quick escalation of nuclear power. Trump signed a series of executive orders last year that allow Wright to approve some advanced reactor designs and projects, taking authority away from the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which has regulated the U.S. nuclear industry for five decades.\n\n“Today is history. A multi-megawatt, next-generation nuclear power plant is loaded in the C-17 behind us,” Wright said before the two-hour flight from March Air Reserve Base in California to Hill Air Force Base in Utah.\n\nThe minivan-sized reactor transported by the military is one of at least three that will reach “criticality” — when a nuclear reaction can sustain an ongoing series of reactions — by July 4, as Trump has promised, Wright said.\n\n“That’s speed, that’s innovation, that’s the start of a nuclear renaissance,” he said.\n\nCurrently, there are 94 operable nuclear reactors in the U.S. that generate about 19% of the country’s electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That's down from 104 reactors in 2013 and includes two new commercial reactors in Georgia that were the nation's first large reactors built from scratch in a generation.\n\nRecognizing delays inherent to deployment of new, full-scale reactors, the industry and government have focused in recent years on more efficient designs, including a small modular reactor proposed by the nation’s largest public power company, the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n\nMicroreactors, designed to be portable, can “accelerate the delivery of resilient power to where it’s needed,” Duffey said. Eventually, the mobile reactors could provide energy security on a military base without the civilian grid, he and other officials said.\n\nThe demonstration flight “gets us closer to deploy nuclear power when and where it is needed to give our nation’s warfighters the tools to win in battle,” Duffey said.\n\nThe reactor transported to Utah will be able to generate up to 5 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 5,000 homes, said Isaiah Taylor, CEO of Valar Atomics, the California startup that produced the reactor. The company hopes to start selling power on a test basis next year and become fully commercial in 2028.\n\nEdwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the transport flight — which included a throng of reporters, photographers and TV news crews — was little more than “a dog-and-pony show” that merely demonstrated the Pentagon's ability to ship a piece of heavy equipment.\n\nThe flight “doesn't answer any questions about whether the project is feasible, economic, workable or safe — for the military and the public,” Lyman said in an interview.\n\nThe Trump administration “hasn't made the safety case” for how microreactors, once loaded with nuclear fuel, can be transported securely to data centers or military bases, Lyman said.\n\nOfficials also have not resolved how nuclear waste will be disposed of, although Wright said the Energy Department is in talks with Utah and other states to host sites that could reprocess fuel or handle permanent disposal.\n\nThe microreactor flown to Utah will be sent to the Utah San Rafael Energy Lab for testing and evaluation, Wright said. Fuel will be provided by the Nevada National Security site, Taylor said.\n\n“The answer to energy is always more,” Wright said. After four years of restrictions on fossil fuels and other polluting energy under the Biden administration, he said, “Now we’re trying to set everything free. And nuclear will be flying soon.”",

    "fullText": "The Milan Cortina Winter Olympics are well underway, and it might be the most that most people will hear about curling or bobsled, at least for the next four years.\n\nFor many viewers, the 2026 Olympic Games have showcased just how peculiar some winter sports can be, from the flight of ski jumping to the rigor of ski mountaineering, a new event this year.\n\nAs unfamiliar as the current lineup of winter Olympic sports might be for some, Olympic Games history reveals even more unusual showcases, like skiers riding behind horses or performing their ballet moves on the snow.\n\nPrior to the 1992 Games, the events featured what were known as \"demonstration events\" where athletes showed off their abilities in a discipline without being awarded official Olympic medals — often to celebrate regionally popular sports in the host country or to test the appeal of more experimental disciplines.\n\nThese eight sports were among the most unusual demonstrations ever held at the Winter Olympics, with some serving as official medal events while others remained only as demonstration sports.\n\nYears: 1924 as an official medal event; 1928, 1936, and 1948 as a demonstration sport.\n\nMilitary patrol combined cross-country skiing with rifle shooting in a team event modeled after alpine military exercises.\n\nFour-man units, typically active-duty soldiers from each country, skied long distances over mountainous terrain, stopping periodically for rifle shooting tests that could add time penalties.\n\nAs the Games moved toward standardized international competition, military patrol was gradually refined into the modern biathlon sport, which debuted as an official Olympic sport in 1960.\n\nYears: 1948, as an official medal event\n\nIntroduced at the 1948 St. Moritz Games, the winter pentathlon combined five disciplines: cross-country skiing, downhill skiing, shooting, fencing, and horse riding.\n\nThe format mirrored the modern pentathlon's test of versatility, and asked athletes to demonstrate endurance, speed, precision, and tactical skill across snow and ice.\n\nThe event attracted limited international participation and was never held again.\n\nYears: 1988 and 1992 as a demonstration sport\n\nSki ballet, later known as acroski, featured choreographed routines performed on gentle slopes to music, blending spins, jumps, and intricate footwork.\n\nJudges scored athletes on technical precision and artistic expression, much as in figure skating.\n\nWhile moguls and aerials — which were other disciplines within the broader freestyle skiing category — evolved into medal sports, ski ballet was dropped after 1992.\n\nYears: 1992 as a demonstration sport\n\nSpeed skiing was a pure test of velocity on snow showcased at the 1992 Albertville Games, with athletes descending a steep, straight course in a tight aerodynamic tuck while reaching speeds of up to 130 mph.\n\nConcerns about safety, along with its narrow competitive format compared with other alpine disciplines, kept it from becoming a permanent Olympic event.\n\nYears: 1928 as a demonstration sport\n\nUnlike modern versions that use harnessed riders, the Olympic exhibition of skijoring at the 1928 St. Moritz Games involved a mounted jockey guiding galloping horses across a frozen lake while a skier held on behind.\n\nThe spectacle, which reflected Alpine winter traditions, drew large crowds, but the sport was seen as more of a novelty exhibition than a standardized international competition and was never added to the official program.\n\nYears: 1932 as a demonstration sport\n\nDog sled racing debuted as a demonstration event at the 1932 Lake Placid Games. The event showcased teams of sled dogs pulling mushers over snowy endurance courses.\n\nIts inclusion highlighted winter culture in the host region, but limited international participation at the time kept it from gaining full Olympic status.\n\nYears: 1952 as a demonstration sport\n\nBandy is a hockey-like team sport played on a large ice field roughly the size of a soccer pitch. Players use curved sticks to move a ball rather than a puck.\n\nOriginating in northern Europe, it predates modern ice hockey and emphasizes passing and field positioning.\n\nThe sport was showcased at the 1952 Oslo Games, although its strong regional concentration, particularly in Scandinavia and parts of the Soviet Union, limited its expansion into a full Olympic event.\n\nYears: 1936 and 1964 as a demonstration sport\n\nIce stock sport, often compared to curling, involves sliding heavy stocks across ice toward a target with the aim of precision placement.\n\nThe sport is popular in Alpine countries such as Austria and Germany, and it was featured twice at the Olympics as a demonstration event.\n\nIts close resemblance to curling and concentrated geographic relevance prevented it from being added permanently to the Olympic lineup.",

    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates fell sharply this week as tensions between the US and Iran stoked the possibility of military conflict. Inflation concerns also lingered, as evidenced in the minutes of the Federal Reserve's latest meeting.\n\nThe 30-year fixed mortgage rate fell 8 basis points to 6.01% for the week ending Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac. That's the lowest level since September 2022. The 15-year fixed dropped 9 basis points to 5.35%.\n\n“This lower rate environment is not only improving affordability for prospective homebuyers, it’s also strengthening the financial position of homeowners,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist. \"Over the past year, refinance application activity has more than doubled, enabling many recent buyers to reduce their annual mortgage payments by thousands of dollars.”\n\nIndeed, refinance applications increased over the past week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Tim Torline, president of investments at Ducenta Squared in Los Angeles, said the rise can be attributed to a small slice of borrowers with higher original loan rates.\n\n“Refinancing activity is likely to be moderate in the near-term, with the market likely on hold until mortgage rates fall below the 6% psychological threshold,” Torline said in a statement.\n\nDiscover the best mortgage refinance lenders\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nHere are 8 strategies for getting the lowest mortgage rate possible.\n\nHere are today's mortgage refinance interest rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAs with mortgage rates for purchase, these are national averages that we've rounded to the nearest hundredth. Refinance rates can be higher than purchase mortgage rates, but that isn't always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage rates will impact your monthly payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use as you shop for homes and lenders. Be sure to use the dropdown to include private mortgage insurance costs and HOA dues if they apply to you. These monthly expenses, along with your mortgage principal and interest rate, will give you a realistic idea of what your monthly payment could be.\n\nA mortgage interest rate is the fee charged by a lender for borrowing money, expressed as a percentage. There are two basic types of mortgage rates: fixed and adjustable rates.\n\nA fixed-rate mortgage locks in your rate for the entire life of your loan. For example, if you get a 30-year mortgage with a 6% interest rate, your rate will remain at 6% for the entire 30 years. (Unless you refinance or sell the home.)\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for the first few years, then changes it periodically. Let’s say you get a 5/1 ARM with an introductory rate of 6%. Your rate would be 6% for the first five years, and then the rate would increase or decrease once per year for the last 25 years of your term. Whether your rate goes up or down depends on several factors, such as the economy and the U.S. housing market.\n\nAt the beginning of your mortgage term, most of your monthly payment goes toward interest. As time passes, less of your payment goes toward interest, and more goes toward the mortgage principal or the amount you originally borrowed.\n\nLearn how to choose between an adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage.\n\nTwo categories determine mortgage rates: things you can control and those you cannot.\n\nWhat factors can you control? First, you can compare the best mortgage lenders to find the one that gives you the lowest rate and fees.\n\nSecond, lenders typically extend lower rates to people with higher credit scores, lower debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, and considerable down payments. If you can save more or pay down debt before securing a mortgage, a lender will probably give you a better interest rate.\n\nWhat factors can you not control? In short, the economy.\n\nThe list of ways the economy impacts mortgage rates is long, but here are the basic details. If the economy — for example, employment — is struggling, mortgage rates decrease to encourage borrowing, which helps boost the economy. If the economy is strong, mortgage rates go up to temper spending.\n\nWith all other factors being equal, mortgage refinance rates are typically slightly higher than purchase rates. So don't be surprised if your refinance rate is higher than you may have expected.\n\nTwo of the most common mortgage terms are 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages. Both lock in your rate for the entire loan term.\n\nA 30-year mortgage is popular because it has relatively low monthly payments. But it comes with a higher interest rate than shorter terms, and because you’re accumulating interest for three decades, you’ll pay a lot of interest in the long run.\n\nA 15-year mortgage can be a good choice because it has a lower rate than you’ll get with longer terms, so you’ll pay less in interest over the years. You’ll also pay off your mortgage much faster. But your monthly payments will be higher because you’re paying off the same loan amount in half the time.\n\nBasically, 30-year mortgages are more affordable from month to month, while 15-year mortgages are cheaper in the long run.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance's weekly survey of lenders with the lowest rates, some of the banks with the lowest mortgage rates are Chase and Citibank. However, it's a good idea to shop around for the best rate, not just with banks, but also with credit unions and companies specializing in mortgage lending.\n\nYes, 2.75% is an amazing mortgage rate. You're unlikely to get a 2.75% rate in today's market unless you take on an assumable mortgage from a seller who locked in this rate in 2020 or 2021, when rates were at all-time lows.\n\nAccording to Freddie Mac, the lowest-ever 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 2.65%. This was the national average in January 2021. It is extremely unlikely that rates will dip below 3% again anytime soon.\n\nSome experts say it's worth refinancing when you can lock in a rate that's 2% less than your current mortgage rate. Others say 1% is the magic number. It all depends on your financial goals when refinancing, how long you plan to stay in the same house, and on your break-even point after paying the refinance closing costs.\n\nWhat caused mortgage rates to fall this week?\n\nHow are lower rates affecting refinance activity?\n\nHow do 30-year and 15-year rates compare?\n\nWhat factors determine current mortgage rate levels?\n\nMortgage rates often decrease before a Federal Reserve meeting rather than after. So, what should you expect rates to do before the Fed meeting on January 27-28?\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac already buy mortgage bonds, and Trump wants them to purchase $200 billion in bonds. Would this strategy cause mortgage rates to decrease?\n\nAverage mortgage rates are in the low 6% range, but there are ways to snag a lower rate.

    "fullText": "KYIV, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Ukraine's popular ex-military chief has provided new details of a rift with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, threatening to deepen a long-simmering conflict between the ‌two wartime leaders amid new speculation around post-war elections.\n\nGeneral Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, who served as ‌Kyiv's top commander until February 2024 and is now its ambassador to London, told the Associated Press in an ​interview published on Wednesday that he felt threatened by a 2022 raid by security agents and blamed Zelenskiy for a major battlefield failure.\n\nThe remarks provide fresh context to a potential rivalry that has long gripped Kyiv's political class.\n\nOpinion polls have consistently shown Zaluzhnyi to be Zelenskiy's main challenger in any ‌future election, although he has ⁠never voiced any ambition to run for office.\n\nZelenskiy, facing U.S. pressure to quickly secure a peace deal in Russia's four-year war, has signalled his readiness ⁠to hold elections when fighting ends.\n\nHis office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Zaluzhnyi's remarks on the 2022 raid. In his nightly address on Wednesday, Zelenskiy did not directly ​comment on ​the AP interview but spoke of the importance ​of national unity and working together to ‌ensure Ukraine’s survival.\n\n\"Any other politics in Ukraine is absolutely unnecessary at present… Personal matters (are for) later,\" he said.\n\nSECURITY RAID, MILITARY MISMANAGEMENT\n\nSpeaking in London, Zaluzhnyi described how his office was raided in September 2022 by dozens of agents from Ukraine's SBU security service, which answers to Zelenskiy.\n\nZaluzhnyi said he then called Zelenskiy's chief of staff with a warning that he would deploy troops to ‌protect his command centre, having already called in reinforcements ​to Kyiv.\n\nThe SBU's press service told Reuters an address used ​by Zaluzhnyi as a covert post ​had been listed in an unrelated organised crime case, and that no ‌searches were carried out.\n\nZaluzhnyi also pinned the failure ​of a much-vaunted 2023 ​counteroffensive on Zelenskiy, saying he did not commit the necessary resources to the campaign.\n\nAimed at breaking Russian defences, it ended mostly in an embarrassing string of defeats for Kyiv. ​Zaluzhnyi said his original plan ‌to focus on a single axis had been overridden by Zelenskiy's order to push ​across much of the front line.",

    "description": "Military students face uncertainty as the Pentagon evaluates universities beyond Harvard, potentially affecting top-leveleducation plans.",
    "fullText": "University officials and military students say they were blindsided by a Pentagon decision to not only sever ties with Harvard University, but also put dozens of other colleges under review.\n\nTroops pursuing military legal and specialist careers are barred from attending Harvard through certain Defense Department-funded programs, officials say, and recent internal messaging has raised the prospect that other long-standing education partnerships could be affected as well.\n\nAfter an internal list of schools under review leaked online last week, Business Insider reached out to each institution for their reaction to the news.\n\nA spokesperson for The George Washington University said the school had not \"received any direct notification or communication\" from the Department of Defense. Northeastern University said the same, sharing that while it was aware of press reports on the matter, it was still working to establish facts.\n\n\"I'm a little bit flabbergasted,\" said a professor at one listed school. \"This is very strange.\" Another questioned what the long-term effects of this decision might be. It's a question military students are asking as well.\n\n\"We've had no clarification as to what's going on,\" shared a prospective lawyer currently on active duty and enrolled at one of the listed schools. Like the professors, they spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of professional repercussions.\n\nLast Friday, screenshots of internal US Army emails began circulating online. The emails, which CNN first reported and Business Insider verified, identified Harvard University as \"fully off limits\" for service members seeking US military tuition assistance while marking 33 other schools as moderate or high risk. Self-paying students were also encouraged to apply elsewhere.\n\nOne email said that prospective students who had applied to or had been accepted to schools like American University, Stanford University, or Georgetown University, among others, \"should have a backup plan\" in case the Pentagon gives those schools the same treatment as Harvard.\n\nArmy spokesperson Cynthia Smith said in a statement to Business Insider on Tuesday that only US military ties to Harvard are being halted. Other university programs are under review, she said, but \"no further decisions have been made at this time.\"\n\nA separate defense official who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive issues also told Business Insider that the list is still \"up in the air.\"\n\nSuch considerations signal a potentially significant shift in how the US military interacts with civilian universities — institutions that have long played a central role in educating military lawyers, specialists, and leaders rising to higher ranks — and raise questions about whether political factors are shaping where troops are permitted to study.\n\nThe Department of Defense declined to provide any further clarity and referred Business Insider to a social media post by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth earlier this month that said the Pentagon intends to sever ties with Harvard for all professional military education programs and fellowships.\n\nHegseth, who received a master's degree in public policy from Harvard's John F. Kennedy School, said Harvard is \"one of the red-hot centers of Hate America activism,\" adding that \"too many faculty members openly loathe our military; they cast our armed forces in a negative light and squelch anyone who challenges their leftist political leanings.\" Harvard hasn't publicly responded.\n\nThe internal Army emails that leaked online were focused on soldiers applying to the Army's legal education program, a pathway to the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG), the military's legal branch. Graduate degrees at civilian universities, however, are not limited to prospective JAGs and also include competitive programs for degrees relevant to other military jobs.\n\nThe potential blacklisting of universities beyond Harvard has prompted concerns among current and prospective students that coveted spots at their chosen schools may be eliminated.\n\nThe active-duty service member preparing for a military legal career at a top law school told Business Insider that they worry that even if they graduate, a degree from a blacklisted university might be viewed unfavorably when future promotion opportunities arise.\n\nAnother service member who is set to start school at a top institution in the fall — and is preparing to relocate their family — said they have not received information about how their studies may be affected; however, they fear that if they are barred from attending their chosen university, they might not have time to apply to another school.\n\n\"It's a thing you earn on merit that I would hate to have taken away,\" they said of their acceptance at a top institution.\n\nUS military officer culture has long prized continued study, particularly for those advancing to senior ranks who are expected to understand the global and strategic implications of American power beyond the boots-on-the-ground level. Civilian graduate programs have historically helped the military build legal, policy, and strategic expertise at senior levels.\n\nEducational priorities are shifting in the Pentagon under the current administration, which has labeled Ivy League schools and other universities as \"woke\" for some of their policies and programs. In some cases, the admin has also threatened federal funding freezes on several schools, including some on the Army list.\n\n\"This is such a slippery slope,\" said Rachel VanLandingham, a professor at Southwestern Law School and a retired Air Force JAG. She expressed alarm at the prospect of certain schools being off-limits for troops without transparency about the exact criteria the Pentagon is using to judge them.\n\n\"Everyone is just kind of scratching their heads,\" she said.",

    "description": "The US has the world's largest military budget. Here's how military budgets compare around the world, and what they reveal about military priorities.",
    "fullText": "The US has the world's most expensive military, spending nearly $1 trillion on defense. That's roughly four times China's reported defense budget, the next largest.\n\nFrom spending on nuclear technology to advanced aircraft and warships, the world's top militaries allocate hundreds of billions of dollars each year to stay ahead.\n\nIn some countries, big-ticket items such as naval assets or technologically advanced aircraft or missiles account for the bulk of military spending, while others devote large sums to maintaining large conscription troop systems.\n\nUltimately, military spending varies by country depending on location and interests, Gian Gentile, a retired US Army colonel and senior historian at RAND, told Business Insider. Some countries prioritize homeland defense while others value overmatch and far-reaching power projection.\n\n\"The US spends a lot on more sophisticated, extremely precise weapon systems,\" he said.\n\nA military's budget can be measured either as a total amount or as a share of its country's GDP, reflecting the burden on its economy. Worldwide, countries spent an average of 2.4% of their GDP on defense in 2024.\n\nWartime spending as a share of GDP typically rises, putting strain on the civilian economy, said Mark Cancian, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Ukraine in 2024, for example, devoted over 15% of its GDP to its military, the highest share globally.\n\nSpending statistics help paint a picture of defense priorities, but they don't always translate into readiness for conflict.\n\n\"Readiness is very expensive, and perishable,\" Cancian said.\n\nA country's on-paper investment in its defense systems doesn't always translate directly into military capability, he added. Training and maintenance are often overlooked in analyses of spending on equipment and technologies.\n\nA particularly significant cost when it comes to technologically advanced aircraft, for instance, is maintenance and sustainment.\n\nStill, looking at military budgets can reveal how much capital each country relies on to defend itself.\n\nLast year, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based think tank, released its Military Balance report, which included data on nearly every country's defense budget based on each's reported 2024 figures.\n\nThe report includes each country's total budget (in US dollars), per-capita figures, and defense budget as a share of GDP. Some countries, such as North Korea, Libya, Syria, Cuba, and Afghanistan, did not publicly report their defense budgets.\n\nThese are the 30 countries that spend the most on their military, ranked by the size of their defense budgets.\n\nDefense budget per capita: $3,785\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,776\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,157\n\nDefense budget per capita: $301\n\nDefense budget per capita: $170\n\nDefense budget per capita: $2,517\n\nDefense budget per capita: $799\n\nDefense budget per capita: $411\n\nDefense budget per capita: $455\n\nDefense budget per capita: $2,220\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,328\n\nDefense budget per capita: $111\n\nDefense budget per capita: $696\n\nDefense budget per capita: $723\n\nDefense budget per capita: $797\n\nDefense budget per capita: $3,589\n\nDefense budget per capita: $578\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,360\n\nDefense budget per capita: $842\n\nDefense budget per capita: $430\n\nDefense budget per capita: $937\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,963\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,184\n\nDefense budget per capita: $1,022\n\nDefense budget: $120.32 billion\n\nDefense budget per capita: $854\n\nDefense budget: $234.98 billion\n\nDefense budget per capita: $166\n\nDefense budget: $967.96 billion\n\nDefense budget per capita: $2,831",

    "fullText": "Ukraine carried out long-range drone attacks overnight against a key Black Sea oil terminal and a plant making components for explosives located deep inside Russia, a security official told Business Insider on Tuesday.\n\nThe twin attacks mark Ukraine's latest long-range strikes and come as Kyiv's forces continue to target facilities inside Russia that directly and indirectly help the country sustain its full-scale invasion.\n\nDrones struck the Tamannaftogaz oil terminal in Russia's Krasnodar region, hitting one of the largest ports in the Black Sea region, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said. They were only authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.\n\nThe attack on the port, the second in less than a month, caused a fire at the facility, the source said, adding that the earlier Ukrainian drone strikes on January 22 damaged several tanks and pipelines at Tamannaftogaz, causing an estimated $50 million in losses. The facility is recognized as an important piece of Russian oil logistics in the Black Sea.\n\nThe source said that the SBU, Ukraine's main internal security agency, \"systematically\" targets Russia's energy and export infrastructure, striking at a major revenue source fueling Moscow's war efforts against its neighbor.\n\nSince August, Ukraine has intensified its long-range drone attacks on Russia's energy sector, striking oil refineries, terminals, tankers, and platforms across the country, and in the Black, Caspian, and even the Mediterranean seas.\n\nUkrainian officials have repeatedly described the deep-strike campaign as \"long-range sanctions\" on Moscow. The attacks have led to a slight decline in Russian oil refining over the past year.\n\nThe deep strikes have also targeted other infrastructure associated with Russian military operations, including factories, weapons storage facilities, and air bases.\n\nOvernight, for instance, Ukrainian drones struck the Metafrax Chemicals plant in the Perm region more than 1,600 kilometers (roughly 1,000 miles) inside Russia.\n\nThe sanctioned plant — one of the largest producers of methanol in Russia and Europe — is used to make chemical components for explosives and other military-related materials, the SBU source said. Several blasts were reported at the facility.\n\nIn a translated statement, the source said \"the SBU continues to systematically work on enterprises that provide the Russian military-industrial complex with raw materials and components for the production of weapons.\"\n\n\"The destruction of such objects reduces the pace of ammunition production, complicates the supply of resources for the army, and directly affects the reduction of the intensity of hostilities against Ukraine,\" they added.\n\nNeither Russia's defense ministry nor its US embassy responded to a request for comment on the attacks. Moscow said its air defenses shot down 334 Ukrainian fixed-wing drones over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe two attacks overnight on Monday were carried out by the SBU's Alpha group, an elite unit considered to be among the best of Ukraine's special forces.\n\nThe Alpha group is regularly behind long-range drone attacks against Russian targets. Forces within the unit also carry out ground operations, including in eastern Ukraine's embattled Donetsk region.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ukrainian military said on Tuesday that it had carried out an attack on the Ilsky oil refinery in Russia's Krasnodar region, which is not far from the Tamannaftogaz terminal that the SBU targeted.\n\n\"The defense forces of Ukraine will continue to systematically carry out measures aimed at weakening the combat potential of the Russian aggressor,\" the military said in a statement published to the Telegram messaging app.",

    "title": "The 10 most dangerous aircraft ever made",
    "description": "Some of the military aircraft featured here were more dangerous for their pilots than their enemies",
    "fullText": "They managed to sneak through the design and testing stages without all their vulnerabilities being discovered and it’s left to the crew, and in some cases passengers, to deal with the often tragic fallout.\n\nThe aircraft listed here were, with one exception, more dangerous than they should have been, but in most cases, this was also a sign of the period in which they were operating.\n\nFor example, entries 2-10 could have been filled with jet fighters from the 1950s and 60s which probably would have been more statistically accurate, but would also have got a bit predictable. Regardless, here are ten aircraft you probably should avoid flying:\n\nEntering service during the British Comet’s awkward pause in operations the Soviet Tu-104 was the world’s only jet airliner for a brief period. What it wasn’t was particularly safe. The controls were heavy, it was unstable, and the highly swept wings had adverse handling characteristics approaching the stalling speed. These quirks might be acceptable in a strategic bomber but were not ideal in an airliner.\n\nThe tendency to pitch up violently, or enter an uncontrollable dive at the stall led to pilots flying the approach into airports 30mph faster than the intended speed often creating problems that the brake chute couldn’t solve. 1958 saw three aircraft lost in accidents with subsequent years seeing a steady drum beat of losses.\n\n32 aircraft were lost in accidents before the type was withdrawn from commercial use, while another aircraft was hit by a missile after a training exercise went awry. Aeroflot withdrew the Tu-104 in 1979 after a false fire alarm led to an aircraft crashing while returning to Moscow airport, killing 58 of 119 onboard. The Russian military continued using the type until 1981 when a Soviet Navy example crashed due to improper loading of cargo, killing 16 Admirals in the process.\n\nWith 201 aircraft built the Tu-104 suffered a loss rate of 16%, better than the next entry but substantially worse than just about any other operational jet airliner.\n\nAfter years of wartime austerity, the de Havilland Comet showed the world that Britain was still at the cutting edge of civil aviation. The world’s first jet-powered airliner entered service with BOAC in 1952 heralding a golden future. Unfortunately, that never arrived.\n\nOn 26 October 1952, a BOAC aircraft ran off the runway at Rome’s Ciampino airport refusing to leave the ground despite the nose being held in the air. Four months later a Canadian Pacific Airlines Comet taking off from Karachi did the same, killing all 11 onboard. Ultimately a modification to the wing leading edge would solve the problem but much worse was to come.\n\nIn January 1954, Comet G-ALYP disintegrated over the Mediterranean killing all onboard. After a brief investigation, the Comet was returned to flight in March. Two weeks later G-ALYY would disappear near Naples. The Comet’s Certificate of Airworthiness was revoked, and a thorough investigation began.\n\nIt was discovered that the crack that caused the first accident began at a rivet hole that had been damaged during build. The thin-gauge metal used to save weight made the early Comets vulnerable to this type of damage and a redesign was required. However the damage was done, the battle lost to the Boeing 707. 114 Comets were built, with 25 being lost.\n\nThe endurance of the Gloster Meteor, the first jet-powered fighter of the Allies, could be measured with an egg timer. Another serious issue was that an engine failure of one of the two engines on take-off could be fatal. The two engines were widely spaced out from each other causing alarmingly asymmetric thrust with one engine out. In some cases, pilots would have their own critical speed recommendation for asymmetric flight based on their leg strength. Other issues included selecting the air brakes with the undercarriage and flaps already down, the resultant blanking of airflow to the tail leading to a dive.\n\nThe limited navigation aids available at the time also caused issues, on one occasion in 1951 a flight of three aircraft from 203 Advanced Flying School at RAF Driffield found themselves having to descend over the sea to gain visual flight conditions.\n\nThe full list of Meteor crashes is astonishing and not only was the aircraft ridden with dangerous design features, it was a new type of aeroplane requiring new skills to many pilots more familiar with piston-engined aircraft. 1952 alone saw 150 Meteors lost in RAF service, 30% of losses for that year, the next highest figure being for Vampires with a ‘mere’ 82 being lost.\n\nThe following year saw a slight easing off with only 143 Meteors lost. In total the RAF alone lost 890 Meteors, accounting for 22% of the production run.\n\nThe Vought Cutlass still looks like it came from the future today. Unfortunately, it’s a future with a very relaxed approach to safety. A lack of thrust was one flaw; a complicated high-pressure hydraulic system was another. In the F7U-1 failure of this could leave the pilot with no control for 11 seconds while pressure decreased enough for manual control to be taken. A third weak point was the fragile nose gear.\n\nAs if having the cockpit 14 feet off the ground at a 9 degrees attitude wasn’t enough for landing and taxiing it was raised to 14 degrees, and in a foreshadowing of the Phantom a full 20 degrees for take-off. Unfortunately, this made the whole spindly assembly liable to collapse on landing, or worse punching up through the cockpit floor into the bottom of the ejection seat causing it to fire.\n\nAs a carrier aircraft, its greatest weakness, of many, was the 23-degree nose-high attitude on approach which essentially guaranteed that if you could see the ship you were doing it wrong. A design flaw meant that while in afterburner the transfer tank that fed fuel to the engines could be drained faster than it was being replenished from the rest of the system.\n\nUnsurprisingly the Cutlass was withdrawn from fleet operations by October 1957, only three and a half years after entering service, although some would remain in second-line use until March 1959 primarily for trial work. 78 of 320 Cutlasses were lost in accidents in only 55,000 flying hours making it one of the most dangerous US Navy jets of all time. Still, that’s amateur hour compared to the next entry.\n\nThe B-24 Liberator was one of the best heavy bombers of the Second World War, and in its Anti Submarine Warfare variants was responsible for sinking more submarines than any other aircraft in history. The C-87 transport version would enjoy none of its siblings’ success. To make a C-87 the bomb bay was converted into a cargo area along with the fuselage forward of the cockpit. Able to carry up to 25 passengers or 12,000lbs (5455kg) of cargo the Liberator Express was an improvement on the existing C-47.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the priority given to its bomber cousin shortcuts were taken in the C-87’s production.\n\nThe use of a lower boost supercharger adversely affected its high-altitude performance. The nose gear was prone to breaking, having not been intended for landings with a full internal load. Cargo was also liable to shift throwing the centre of gravity out of limits, causing the aircraft to climb or dive uncontrollably. In the book, ‘Fate is the Hunter’ author and pilot Ernest K Gann details the C-87’s faults, including the time he nearly destroyed the Taj Mahal after taking off in a C-87 with three tonnes more fuel than expected.\n\nThe C-87’s loss rate was over 50% with 152 of 287 lost. In comparison, despite regularly being engaged in air-to-air combat, only around 33% of Liberators were lost.\n\nThe Latécoère 631 was the ultimate in late ‘30s flying boats with six engines, twin tails, and a bar in the nose, unfortunately, the second world war would delay its service entry to 1946. Before this, the first example had been commandeered by the Luftwaffe, and then sunk at its moorings by the RAF. In October 1945 the second aircraft was flying between Rio de Janeiro and Montevideo when the number 3 propeller broke off.\n\nOne blade hit the number 2 engine's propeller and another ripped through the fuselage killing two passengers. Air France continued its operations and it wasn’t until February 1948 when a brand new 631 crashed into the English Channel in bad weather.\n\nAugust 1948 saw aircraft F-BDRC disappear over the Atlantic. Air France took the opportunity to cancel its orders while the French government created a company to use the remaining examples for cargo.  Meanwhile, F-WANU was used to discover what had led to F-BDRC’s loss, leading to it too crashing. Another company was now formed to use two of the remaining 631s for cargo operations. When one of these broke up in a thunderstorm over Cameroon in 1955 operations finally stopped.\n\nFour of seven Latécoère 631s were lost in accidents with all onboard dying, making it one of the more dangerous airliners ever to fly; a further four 631 planes were never even used.\n\nThe Crusader was a handful, which was painfully apparent when it came to landing, a terrible quality in a carrier aircraft. A terrifying total of 493 Crusader pilots had to exit the aircraft by ejection seat. Overall, 517 of the 1261 Crusaders had been built had been lost. This loss rate of 41% is dismal, and that there is 737 entries in the Aviation Safety Network database is clearly atrocious.\n\nThe high approach speed of 147 knots was a big issue on smaller carriers such as the Essex-class. Consistent speed was also important. To help, an autothrottle (Approach Power Compensator) was added in 1964, but even this caused problems as over-reliance on the APC was equally dangerous. Another peculiarity of the F-8 was its odd relationship between nose attitude and sink rate caused by its oddest design feature, on landing the wing stayed at the same angle of attack as the fuselage tilted (the wing was mounted on a mechanism).\n\nThings were particularly counter-intuitive for the pilot in the final approach stages, which again required attention. The Crusader, fine in many ways, was an extremely dangerous aeroplane.\n\nThe Supermarine Scimitar was a twin-jet naval fighter from the manufacturers of the Spitfire. Despite having two engines each producing 11,000lbs of thrust, the overly thick wing, prevented it being supersonic in anything other than a dive. It also suffered a horrendous loss rate. For a naval aircraft surprisingly few of its accidents directly involved an aircraft carrier. Two suffered cable breaks after landing and fell off the front of the ship.\n\nA third suffered brake failure while taxiing to the catapult, while a fourth ditched after an aborted landing. A fifth aircraft suffered an engine failure on approach.\n\nScimitars also suffered nine losses due to hydraulic failures, 5 due to engine failures, a couple each due to bird strikes, fuel leaks, or Controlled Flight into Terrain. There were also 7 losses for unknown reason. In an unusual twist, two of the three surviving Scimitars were involved in a mid-air collision over Malta in April 1964 when 807 squadron was on its way back from the Far East.\n\nOverall of 76 Scimitars built, 39 were lost in accidents - a staggering 51%  - all essentially in peacetime: the closest they came to a war was deterring an Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1961.\n\nThe Republic F-105 Thunderchief had an auspicious start to life with the first two prototypes breaking their backs in landing accidents. Given the airframe needed a complete redesign to reach the contracted top speed this was probably less of a problem than it at first seemed. However, it wasn’t an encouraging sign when after all the modifications to achieve that were done the third prototype very nearly did the same thing. In this case the main gear refused to extend as the engine auxiliary intakes, located in the gear bay, had opened and the suction from the Pratt and Whitney J-75s was holding the doors firmly shut.\n\nIn a cruel twist with the engine shut down the test pilot was walking away from the aircraft only for it to slowly hoist itself up onto its wheels, the hydraulics being able to overcome gravity if not vacuums.\n\nAside from the excessive heat and humidity requiring modification to the Thunderchief the single hydraulic system controlling the horizontal stabiliser soon emerged as a weak point.  Damage to the system would force the aircraft into an irrecoverable dive - F-105s were also falling to North Vietnamese air defences, primarily guns, at a shocking rate. At least 60 were lost in 1965, 111 in 1966, and a further 97 in 1967. In all 334 Thunderchiefs were lost in combat over Vietnam nearly 20% of USAF losses and 40% of all F-105s produced.\n\nEven in the context of war, this was bad when compared to loss rates for aircraft in WW2. A further 63 were lost in accidents in South East Asia while when other losses are included well over 50% of all Thunderchiefs produced were lost.\n\nBuilt by the Imperial Japanese Navy’s Yokosuka arsenal, the MXY-7 Ohka suicide bomb was a 20 foot tube with stub wings. The doomed pilot was sandwiched between a 1200kg warhead and a 4500 pound thrust rocket motor. Surprisingly, there was armour plating at the rear of the cockpit to protect the pilot. Despite a top speed of over 500mph, the Ohka was not the highly effective weapon that had been hoped for.\n\nKamikaze attacks in converted fighters had shown limited success but the MXY-7 had an Achilles heel. Its limited range required it to be carried to the target by a converted G4M ‘Betty’ bomber.\n\nCarrying the Ohka compromised the G4M’s speed, and its ceiling was reduced to a dangerously low 16,400 feet. On their first mission on 21 March 1945, all the bombers were intercepted before they were within 50 miles of their target. Although some MXY-7s were released, with a range of only 20 miles it would be to no effect. The Ohka’s performance didn’t improve, only one ship, the destroyer USS Mannert L Abele was sunk by the MXY-7, with 84 sailors believed killed. Given there were 74 MXY-7 missions, and the Betty itself had a crew of seven, it’s entirely possible more Japanese lives were lost in Ohka missions than American. Quite how a suicide aircraft could be even more dangerous than it was intended to be is a grim and perplexing question…\n\nJoe Coles is the author of The Hush-Kit Book of Warplanes Vol 1.\n\nIf you enjoyed this story, please click the Follow button above to see more like it from Autocar",

Anthropic’s terms of use prohibit the use of Claude for violent ends, for the development of weapons or for conducting surveillance.\n\nAnthropic was the first AI developer known to be used in a classified operation by the US department of defence. It was unclear how the tool, which has capabilities ranging from processing PDFs to piloting autonomous drones, was deployed.\n\nA spokesperson for Anthropic declined to comment on whether Claude was used in the operation, but said any use of the AI tool was required to comply with its usage policies. The US defence department did not comment on the claims.\n\nThe WSJ cited anonymous sources who said Claude was used through Anthropic’s partnership with Palantir Technologies, a contractor with the US defence department and federal law enforcement agencies. Palantir refused to comment on the claims.\n\nThe US and other militaries increasingly deploy AI as part of their arsenals. Israel’s military has used drones with autonomous capabilities in Gaza and has extensively used AI to fill its targeting bank in Gaza. The US military has used AI targeting for strikes in Iraq and Syria in recent years.\n\nCritics have warned against the use of AI in weapons technologies and the deployment of autonomous weapons systems, pointing to targeting mistakes created by computers governing who should and should not be killed.\n\nAI companies have grappled with how their technologies should engage with the defence sector, with Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, calling for regulation to prevent harms from the deployment of AI. Amodei has also expressed wariness over the use of AI in autonomous lethal operations and surveillance in the US.\n\nThis more cautious stance has apparently rankled the US defence department, with the secretary of war, Pete Hegseth, saying in January that the department wouldn’t “employ AI models that won’t allow you to fight wars”.\n\nThe Pentagon announced in January that it would work with xAI, owned by Elon Musk. The defence department also uses a custom version of Google’s Gemini and OpenAI systems to support research.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Feb 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. military is preparing for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran if President Donald Trump orders an attack, two U.S. officials told Reuters, in what could become a ‌far more serious conflict than previously seen between the countries.\n\nThe disclosure by the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity due ‌to the sensitive nature of the planning, raises the stakes for the diplomacy underway between the United States and Iran.\n\nU.S. and Iranian diplomats held talks in Oman last week in ​an effort to revive diplomacy over Tehran's nuclear program, after Trump amassed military forces in the region, raising fears of new military action.\n\nU.S. officials said on Friday the Pentagon was sending an additional aircraft carrier to the Middle East, adding thousands more troops along with fighter aircraft, guided-missile destroyers and other firepower capable of waging attacks and defending against them.\n\nTrump, speaking to U.S. troops on Friday at a base in North Carolina, said it had \"been difficult ‌to make a deal\" with Iran.\n\n\"Sometimes you have ⁠to have fear. That's the only thing that really will get the situation taken care of,\" Trump said.\n\nAsked for comment on the preparations for a potentially sustained U.S. military operation, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said: \"President Trump has ⁠all options on the table with regard to Iran.\"\n\n\"He listens to a variety of perspectives on any given issue, but makes the final decision based on what is best for our country and national security,\" Kelly said.\n\nThe Pentagon declined to comment.\n\nThe United States sent two aircraft carriers to the region last year, when ​it ​carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nHowever, June's \"Midnight Hammer\" operation was essentially a ​one-off U.S. attack, with stealth bombers flying from the United ‌States to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran staged a very limited retaliatory strike on a U.S. base in Qatar.\n\nThe planning underway this time is more complex, the officials said.\n\nIn a sustained campaign, the U.S. military could hit Iranian state and security facilities, not just nuclear infrastructure, one of the officials said. The official declined to provide specific detail.\n\nExperts say the risks to U.S. forces would be far greater in such an operation against Iran, which boasts a formidable arsenal of missiles. Retaliatory Iranian strikes also increase the risk of a regional conflict.\n\nThe same official said the ‌United States fully expected Iran to retaliate, leading to back-and-forth strikes and reprisals ​over a period of time.\n\nThe White House and Pentagon did not respond to questions about ​the risks of retaliation or regional conflict.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened ​to bomb Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and crushing of internal dissent. On Thursday, he warned ‌the alternative to a diplomatic solution would \"be very traumatic, very ​traumatic.\"\n\nIran's Revolutionary Guards have warned that ​in case of strikes on Iranian territory, they could retaliate against any U.S. military base.\n\nThe U.S. maintains bases throughout the Middle East, including in Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Trump for talks ​in Washington on Wednesday, saying that if an ‌agreement with Iran were reached, \"it must include the elements that are vital to Israel.\"\n\nIran has said it is prepared to discuss ​curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for lifting sanctions, but has ruled out linking the issue to missiles.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: in 2025 briefing to Wes Streeting, officials warned reputation of tech firm behind US ICE operations would hinder rollout of data system in UK\n\nHealth officials fear Palantir’s reputation will hinder the delivery of a “vital” £330m NHS contract, according to briefings seen by the Guardian, sparking fresh calls for the deal to be scrapped.\n\nIn 2023, ministers selected Palantir, a US surveillance technology company that also works for the Israeli military and Donald Trump’s ICE operation, to build an AI-enabled data platform to connect disparate health information across the NHS.\n\nNow it has emerged that after Keir Starmer demanded faster deployment, Whitehall officials privately warned that the public perception of Palantir would limit its rollout, meaning the contract would not offer value for money.\n\nPalantir was this week called “ghastly” and “a highly questionable organisation” by MPs in the House of Commons.\n\nThe fallout over Peter Mandelson’s relationship to the convicted child sexual abuse offender Jeffrey Epstein has also affected the image of Palantir, which employed the former US ambassador’s lobbying company, Global Counsel.\n\nBefore he was sacked, Mandelson took Starmer to meet Palantir’s chief executive, Alex Karp, at the tech company’s Washington showroom.\n\nMPs last week demanded greater transparency around Palantir’s public sector deals, which also include a £240m contract with the Ministry of Defence and with several police forces.\n\nIn a private briefing for Wes Streeting before a meeting with Palantir’s European boss, Louis Mosley, in June 2025, Department of Health officials wrote: “The public perception of the [Federated Data Platform (FDP)] during the procurement, and then in delivery, has been affected by the profile of Palantir.\n\n“We do not know the extent to which this is impacting on delivery. It is, however, likely to make it harder to go further with the FDP, and to encourage the inclusion of GP data locally.”\n\nThe briefing was released under the Freedom of Information Act to Foxglove, a tech fairness campaign group.\n\nThe officials said the rollout had also been affected by debates about patient privacy and concerns that the NHS was being “locked-in” to a single vendor, but added: “Many of these debates are inaccurate and are often as a result of misconceptions.”\n\nDonald Campbell, director of advocacy at Foxglove, said: “The prime minister and the health secretary should listen to the public they serve when they tell them Palantir has no place in the NHS.\n\n“They should not be scheming with tech billionaires’ staff on how best they can ‘mitigate’ the ‘public perception’ problems these tech giants deservedly face through their own repellent behaviour.”\n\nThe BMA, which represents NHS doctors, said it has “long opposed the involvement of Palantir in the delivery of care and the use of patient data in our NHS, and it is concerning to see from this briefing that the government felt public concern about Palantir should be dismissed as ‘misconceptions’”.\n\nThe briefing document suggested Streeting could ask Palantir how to speed up the rollout, and say that the government was keen to “remove unnecessary obstacles” including by revisiting “regulations relating to confidential patient information”.\n\nStreeting on Monday sought to show he had “nothing to hide” regarding his relationship with Mandelson by publishing their WhatsApp messages between August 2024 and October 2025.\n\nNone mentioned Palantir, although in one exchange just over three weeks after Streeting’s meeting with the company, Mandelson encouraged him to visit the US and said: “Need to plan. Lots of tech companies and people to talk to.”\n\nNew figures released on Thursday showed that the number of NHS organisations using the Palantir technology has increased since June from 118 to 151, which is still well short of the target of 240 by the end of this year.\n\nPalantir was co-founded by the Trump supporter and billionaire Peter Thiel, who has previously said “the NHS makes people sick”, and described the British public’s affection for the NHS as a case of “Stockholm syndrome” – the term for hostages who feel a bond with their captors.\n\nThe former Conservative government minister David Davis said the government now faced a “huge value-for-money issue” over the Palantir contract.\n\nHe said there had been “naivety in the senior management of the NHS” in awarding a contract to a company with “spectacular baggage in terms of its genesis in the American security state”.\n\n“The government is going to have a problem with many hospital trusts and they are going to have really difficult problems with the GPs,” he said. “My best estimate is they will never get most of the GPs with an organisation like Palantir.”\n\nJohn Puntis, co-chair of the Keep Our NHS Public campaign, said: “This looks like another example of a hugely wasteful IT contract, and lack of public trust will make it unworkable.\n\n“They ought to end the contract or not renew it. They should accept that the public is very concerned and it is going to make the use of public data very difficult if people think it’s going to be accessed by a company like Palantir.”\n\nA spokesperson for Palantir said: “Palantir software is helping to deliver better public services in the UK. That includes delivering 99,000 more NHS operations and reducing hospital discharge delays by 15%, as well as helping the Royal Navy keep ships at sea for longer and the police to tackle domestic violence.”\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The Federated Data Platform is already delivering for the NHS – helping to join-up patient care, increase hospital productivity, speed up cancer diagnosis and ensure thousands of additional patients can be treated each month.\n\n“All providers go through a rigorous, competitive procurement process in line with Government legislation. All data operates under the instruction of the NHS, with strict stipulations in the contract about confidentiality.”\n\nNHS England declined to comment.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 12 (Reuters) - India on Thursday gave initial clearance for a 3.6-trillion-rupee ($40 billion) boost to the country's armed forces, including procurement of more Rafale fighter ‌jets for the air force and Boeing P-8I reconnaissance aircraft for the navy.\n\nHeightened ‌tensions with its neighbours, including Pakistan, have pushed India's military to modernise.\n\nThe air force's fighter squadron strength has shrunk ​to 29 in recent months, well below the 42 it had earlier. Its workhorse MiG-21 was retired in September and other early variants of the MiG-29, the Anglo-French Jaguar and the French Mirage 2000, are also set to end service in the coming years.\n\nNew Delhi has long relied on ‌importing machinery and weapons for its ⁠armed forces, but a recent push by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has helped boost domestic manufacturing.\n\nFor the Indian Air Force, this era began in ⁠the 1980s but was fruitful only in the last decade when the locally produced Tejas fighter jet was introduced to replace Soviet-era MiG-21s.\n\nHindustan Aeronautics (HAL) has nearly 180 of the advanced Mk-1A variants of the ​Tejas ​on order domestically, but has yet to begin deliveries ​due to engine supply chain issues ‌at GE Aerospace.\n\nThe defence ministry said the Defence Acquisition Council had given the initial nod for more Rafale fighter jets and missiles for the air force, anti-tank missiles for the army and P-8I reconnaissance aircraft for its navy.\n\nThe total value of all these proposals stands at 3.6 trillion rupees, the statement said. It did not elaborate further.\n\nThe approvals come ahead of a visit ‌by French President Emmanuel Macron to India next week. ​The Indian Air Force's fleet currently includes Rafale fighters ​from Dassault Aviation.\n\nIn April, India signed ​a deal for 26 Rafale-Marine twin- and single-seat jets to be deployed on ‌its two carriers: INS Vikrant and INS ​Vikramaditya.\n\nSeparately, the defence ministry ​on Thursday also signed a deal with HAL to buy eight Dornier 228 aircraft for the coastguard.\n\nThe proposals pave the way for commercial and technical details to be ​finalized soon.\n\nEarlier in the day, ‌local media reported that the DAC had given its approval to buy 114 Rafale ​fighter jets from Dassault for 3.25 trillion rupees.",

    "description": "Without more aircraft to hit Chinese defenses, the Air Force might have to hold back, risking the military getting drawn into a slog, experts said.",
    "fullText": "The US Air Force will need a lot more next-generation fighter jets and bombers to fight a war against China, former pilots and airpower experts argued in a new report.\n\nThey said the Air Force will need to procure significantly more of the new and coming B-21 Raider bombers and F-47 fighter jets than it currently plans to buy. Insufficient numbers may force the service to operate conservatively, potentially giving China an edge in such a fight, they warned in a Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies policy paper out this week.\n\nThe report said that China's anti-access and area-denial network, together with its natural geography, creates sanctuaries from which its air and missile defenses can fire. The firepower available to Chinese forces within these sanctuaries could pose a threat to US forces, making eliminating them critical to US operations.\n\n\"The Air Force's stealthy bombers and fighter inventories have the survivability needed to penetrate high-density threat areas but lack enough sortie capacity for a conflict with China,\" wrote report authors Heather Penney and retired Air Force colonel Mark Gunzinger.\n\nThe authors propose that the Air Force field at least 200 B-21s and 300 F-47s, which would be roughly double the service's current plans. The Air Force has said it will purchase at least 185 of the F-47s developed by Boeing and at least 100 of the B-21s produced by Northrop Grumman. The Mitchell Institute identifies Boeing and Lockheed Martin as supporters.\n\nThe authors additionally recommended boosting procurement of Lockheed's fifth-generation F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter and Boeing's advanced F-15EX Eagle II.\n\nIn an virtual event discussing the new report, Penney, a former F-16 pilot, said that past conflicts in Korea and Vietnam, as well as Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine, have shown that unless militaries take out enemy bases and sanctuaries, they could end up stuck in wars of attrition, the gradual bleeding of personnel and resources and little movement on the battlefield.\n\nIn a conflict with China, the US would likely face more advanced air defenses than it did in last year's Midnight Hammer operation against Iran or this year's Operation Absolute Resolve against Venezuela. Without a greater reserve of aircraft, Penney said, Air Force tactics for targeting Chinese sanctuaries would likely have to be less aggressive to avoid unnecessary risk to a limited fleet.\n\nThe B-21 is in low-rate initial production, though the only deliveries have been test, not operational, aircraft, while the contract for the design and development of the F-47 fighter jet was only awarded last year.\n\nNeither aircraft is expected to be operational in significant numbers for years. In the meantime, the Air Force is dependent on older, though still capable, bombers like the B-52 Stratofortress, B-1 Lancer, and B-2 Spirit.\n\nThe Mitchell Institute said budget increases of at least $40 billion a year could support higher procurement rates, as well as the acquisition of uncrewed Collaborative Combat Aircraft, or \"loyal wingmen\" drones, which Air Force officials have said won't replace crewed planes but instead complement them.\n\nMultiple assessments have found the Air Force's fleet is the smallest, oldest, and least combat-ready it has been in decades. By the numbers, today's inventory of fighters, bombers, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft is a fraction of its Cold War strength.\n\nAt the same time, experts have highlighted that the Air Force has been under increased strain due to constant conflicts and missions. A US Government Accountability Office report from 2024 said continuous deployments had reduced Air Force readiness, personnel, equipment, and aircraft. The government watchdog agency found that the service was pursuing fixes to these issues, but the demand on these forces was still higher than capacity.",

    "fullText": "The recent airspace closure around El Paso, Texas, was caused by the U.S. Military shooting down a party balloon amid a behind-the-scenes spat with air safety officials, multiple reports say.\n\nThat contradicts the explanation provided on Tuesday by administration officials, which claimed the closure was necessary because drones operated by Mexican drug cartels were being downed as they crossed the southern border.\n\nFlights at the El Paso International Airport were grounded and inbound planes, including medical evacuation flights, were forced to divert 45 minutes away to Las Cruces, New Mexico, said the border city’s enraged mayor.\n\n“I want to be very, very clear that this should’ve never happened,” Mayor Renard Johnson said in a news conference on Wednesday. “You cannot restrict air space over a major city without coordinating with the city, the airport, the hospitals, the community leadership... That failure to communicate is unacceptable.”\n\nSources tell CBS News the dramatic shoot-down and airspace closure “stemmed from disagreements between the Federal Aviation Administration and Pentagon officials over drone-related tests,” suggesting friction between federal officials and the military.\n\nThe network’s sources said that Fort Bliss, which abuts the city’s airport, received new laser technology that the Pentagon, led by Defense Secretary Pete Hegeth, was itching to test ASAP to practice taking down drones.\n\nThe FAA, meanwhile, wished to hold meetings on “over safety impacts” scheduled for later this month, CBS reports. Sources also told The New York Times that the FAA had “concerns about the risks” the new anti-drone tech “could pose to other aircraft in the area.”\n\nNeither the Pentagon nor the FAA responded to requests for comment. Mexican officials say they have seen no evidence that a drone was shot down at the border.\n\nAirspace was initially announced as shut down in El Paso for 10 days, an unusual period for a commercial airport of that size, but it was reopened early Wednesday after it was determined there were no credible threats to air travel.",

    "description": "A Pentagon plan to use a high-energy, counter-drone laser without having coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration about potential risks to civilian flights prompted Wednesday’s unprecedented airspace shutdown over El Paso, Texas, multiple sources tell CNN.",
    "fullText": "A Pentagon plan to use a high-energy, counter-drone laser without having coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration about potential risks to civilian flights prompted Wednesday’s unprecedented airspace shutdown over El Paso, Texas, multiple sources told CNN.\n\nA source familiar with the timeline of events said that the US military used the laser technology to shoot down four mylar balloons this week, contributing to the decision by the FAA to shut down local airspace.\n\nThose accounts come as the Trump administration has claimed that a Mexican cartel drone crossing into US airspace is what triggered the 10-mile restriction centered on El Paso International Airport.\n\nLate Tuesday, the FAA abruptly issued a temporary flight restriction that immediately grounded all flights up to 18,000 feet around the city for 10 days, effectively shutting down El Paso International Airport.\n\nRoughly eight hours later, the restriction was lifted. By the time the FAA had lifted the flight restrictions, airlines had already issued travel waivers and notified customers of potential changes.\n\nMultiple sources from the federal government and US airlines told CNN that military activity near El Paso, including US drones monitoring cartel operations and the Pentagon’s planned use of a high-energy laser designed to counter drones, raised immediate concerns for civilian traffic arriving and departing El Paso International Airport. Fort Bliss and its airfield, Biggs Army Airfield, sit just north of the commercial airport, which serves about 100 flights each day.\n\nFAA and Pentagon officials had been scheduled to meet February 20 to review potential impacts and mitigation measures for a test of the laser system, a technology the Pentagon has been testing in more remote areas of the country, multiple sources said. But the Defense Department sought to use the system sooner around El Paso, prompting the FAA to impose the temporary flight restriction until that coordination could occur. The 10-day restriction would have expired on February 21, one day after DoD and the FAA were set to meet.\n\nThe FAA’s decision to close the airspace was made without telling the White House first, according to people familiar with the matter. The issue became a topic of intense focus inside the West Wing in the early morning hours of Wednesday, as Texas lawmakers pressed for answers on why the airspace was suddenly closed without first alerting them.\n\nAn administration official said Wednesday morning that the shutdown was triggered by Defense Department “action to disable” cartel drones. It’s unclear if the presence of drones might have led to the acceleration of the deployment of the laser system.\n\nCNN reached out to the FAA and White House for comment about the differing explanations. The Pentagon on Wednesday continued to refer to the administration official’s statement about a drone breach having caused the airspace closure.\n\nSecretary of Transportation Sean Duffy posted to social media crediting the FAA and Defense Department with acting “swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion.”\n\n“The threat has been neutralized, and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region,” he wrote on X.\n\nIncursions along the southern border are extremely common and historically do not prompt such airspace closures. In 2024, for example, Air Force Gen. Greg Guillot, the commander of NORTHCOM, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the number of incursions along the US Mexico border was “over a thousand” each month.\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration and other US security agencies have used facilities at the Biggs Army Airfield for years as part of efforts to monitor Mexico-based drug cartel operations, current and former US officials said.\n\nEl Paso, with a population of nearly 700,000, is the sixth-largest city in Texas and one of the 25 largest in the United States. It is a hub of cross-border commerce alongside neighboring Ciudad Juárez in Mexico.\n\nNearly 3.5 million passengers passed through El Paso International Airport in the first 11 months of 2025, according to its website. The airport describes itself as the gateway to West Texas, southern New Mexico and northern Mexico.\n\nThe US military has been testing laser-based air defenses against drones in recent months. Last summer, the Army conducted a live-fire exercise using directed energy weapons alongside more traditional air defense systems at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. And last fall, the Army put out a request to industry for ideas on a counter-drone Enduring-High Energy Laser (E-HEL) weapon system.\n\nIn the initial flight restrictions, the FAA classified the area around El Paso﻿ as “(National) Defense Airspace” and said pilots who violated the restriction could be intercepted, detained and questioned by law enforcement.\n\nIt warned that additional actions could be taken for pilots who don’t adhere to the restrictions, including suspension of flight certifications, criminal charges, and that the US government “may use deadly force” if an aircraft poses an “imminent security threat.”\n\nThe sudden FAA restrictions seemed to catch pilots and air traffic controllers by surprise.\n\nAudio from LiveATC.net caught the moment pilots were made aware of the grounding.\n\n“Just pass it on to everybody else, at 06:30 for the next 10 days, we’re all at a ground stop,” a controller said.\n\nA pilot replied, “OK, ground stop 06:30 for how long?”\n\n“Ten days,” the controller replied.\n\n“So the airport is totally closed?” the pilot said, chuckling.\n\nThe controller replied, “Apparently, we just got informed about 30 minutes to an hour ago.”\n\n“So for 10 days you guys are not open,” the pilot said, in disbelief.\n\n“Well, we’ll be here, but no air traffic,” the controller said.\n\n“OK,” the pilot said while laughing.\n\nSamuel, a traveler in El Paso, told CNN affiliate KFOX he was doing a book tour with a client and didn’t get any notification from his airline.\n\n“I just kind of saw all the cops here and the news cameras,” he said. “I gotta figure out what’s going on if there’s another airport that’s not in El Paso, and try to figure out and rent a car out.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas told reporters Wednesday that the closure of the El Paso International Airport was solely a FAA decision and that local officials — including members of Congress — were left completely in the dark before it happened.\n\nShe stressed that she was not notified in advance despite representing the congressional district that’s home to the airport, Fort Bliss and the broader El Paso community.\n\n“They did not alert the El Paso city manager or the El Paso mayor,” Escobar said on a press call Wednesday morning. “Everyone locally on the ground was in the dark, and the impact, obviously, is highly consequential.”\n\nThe Associated Press and CNN’s Evan Perez, Kevin Liptak, Kit Mayer, Camila DeChalus, Karina Tsui, and Diego Mendoza contributed to this report.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats took to the Senate floor Wednesday to deliver impassioned speeches denouncing the Justice Department’s attempt to indict a group of lawmakers who last year urged U.S. military members to resist “illegal orders,” framing the episode as a dire test for their chamber and the rule of law.\n\n“The fact that they failed to incarcerate a United States senator should not obviate our outrage. They tried to incarcerate two of us,” said Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii. “I am not entirely sure the United States Senate can survive this if we do not have Republicans standing up.”\n\nSchatz was among a string of Democratic senators who spoke a day after a Washington grand jury declined to indict six Democratic lawmakers, including Sens. Elissa Slotkin and Mark Kelly, over a 90-second video that drew fierce backlash from President Donald Trump.\n\nWhile Democrats blasted the Trump administration, they also challenged their Republican colleagues to speak out. Sen. Chris Murphy called it a “test for the Senate\" that \"could break this institution permanently.”\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Slotkin and Kelly praised the grand jury’s decision, with Slotkin saying that “if things had gone a different way, we’d be preparing for arrest.”\n\n“A group of anonymous Americans upheld the rule of law and determined that this case should not proceed,” she said.\n\nThe failed indictments mark a high-profile setback for the Justice Department, which has faced mounting scrutiny from Democrats and some Republicans over investigations seen as aligned with Trump’s political grievances. The episode has raised stark First Amendments questions about the potential prosecution of sitting members of Congress for their speech.\n\n\"This is not a good news story,” Kelly said. “This is a story about how Donald Trump and his cronies are trying to break our system in order to silence anyone who lawfully speaks out against them.”\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer similarly framed the attempt as a broader free speech threat, saying that if Trump “believes that he can even attempt to jail senators over speech he dislikes, then the First Amendment is no longer a basic right.”\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said the Justice Department's response “wouldn’t have been my response to that, but we are where we are.”\n\n“The indictment didn’t withstand the scrutiny of a grand jury. It was clear it was not going anywhere,” Thune said.\n\nKelly and Slotkin said during a joint press conference that they have not been told what charges prosecutors sought, and it's unclear whether prosecutors plan to keep pursuing the case. The senators sent a letter Wednesday asking the Justice Department to confirm the investigation is now closed, they said.\n\nThe two senators and four House members have been embroiled in fallout from the video for months. Trump reacted angrily to their video, labeling it “seditious” and saying on social media that the offense was “punishable by death.”\n\nAll six of the Democratic lawmakers who appeared in the 90-second video served in the military or intelligence community. They said the video’s purpose was to simply affirm existing law after receiving outreach from members of the military.\n\nOn the other side of the Capitol, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana said the video warrants criminal scrutiny.

    "fullText": "The US military intercepted Mexican cartel drones that breached US airspace, a Trump administration official said on Wednesday, explaining why the government made the rare decision to temporarily restrict flights over El Paso.\n\nThe official told Business Insider that \"Mexican cartel drones breached US airspace,\" adding that the Pentagon \"took action to disable the drones.\"\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and Pentagon \"have determined there is no threat to commercial travel,\" the official added.\n\nIt's unclear how the US military disabled the cartel drones — whether they were shot down or jammed with electronic warfare technology — or if they were carrying any drugs. The Pentagon declined to provide additional information about the incident.\n\nA social media account for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, which advises Pentagon leadership on cutting-edge technology, published a photo showing what appears to be a laser destroying a small drone with the caption \"defend the homeland,\" suggesting that directed energy may have been involved in the El Paso incident.\n\nFort Bliss, a major US Army installation in El Paso, could not immediately be reached for comment on the incident.\n\nCartels in Latin America have a history of using drones for drug-related operations, including for smuggling.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a social media post that the FAA and Pentagon \"acted swiftly\" to address what he described as a \"cartel drone incursion.\"\n\nThe FAA earlier issued a surprise notice shutting down the airspace above El Paso, a major city in west Texas on the US-Mexico border, and halting all flights up to 18,000 feet for 10 days due to \"special security reasons.\" The restricted area covered a 10-mile radius.\n\nThe restrictions went into effect from 11:30 p.m. MT on Tuesday and were scheduled to last until the same time on February 20. The FAA warned that the US \"may use deadly force\" if an aircraft became \"an imminent security threat.\" It did not offer more details about the situation.\n\nRep. Veronica Escobar, whose congressional district includes El Paso, called the FAA's decision \"unprecedented.\"\n\nHowever, the FAA said shortly before 7 a.m. MT on Wednesday that the temporary airspace closure over El Paso had been lifted, adding that \"all flights will resume as normal.\" The agency did not share additional details about the bizarre, hourslong incident, which appeared to catch local lawmakers by surprise.\n\nIn recent years, access to drones has become easier for both state and non-state actors, prompting Western militaries to explore low-cost methods to counter them, including both kinetic and electronic technologies.\n\nThese concerns are top of mind among Western countries following a string of drone incursions across Europe near the end of 2025, during which Russian drones violated the airspace of multiple NATO states and unidentified drones were spotted above critical infrastructure — including airports — in other allied countries.",

    "fullText": "Feb 10 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy assembled his top military officers on Tuesday to discuss shortcomings in air defence and other aspects of protecting civilians ‌from attack nearly four years into Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nZelenskiy, speaking in his ‌nightly video address, also assessed how local authorities in Ukraine's cities were tackling the aftermath of massive Russian ​attacks, particularly in ensuring high-rise apartments had power and heating. He again singled out for criticism officials in the capital Kyiv.\n\nZelenskiy said he held long discussions with the military's Commander-in-Chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, the chief of the general staff, Andrii Hnatov, and Defence Minister Mykhailo Fedorov.\n\n\"Many changes are ‌happening right now in the ⁠work of air defence. In some regions, the way teams operate, interceptors, mobile fire units, the entire small air defence component is being practically ⁠rebuilt completely,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\n\"But this is only one element of defence that requires changes. Changes will happen.\"\n\nThe president has frequently pointed to improved air defences as critical to protecting ​cities from ​air attacks and has asked Kyiv's Western allies ​to provide more weaponry to knock ‌out incoming missiles and drones.\n\nLast week, with heating still not restored to hundreds of dwellings after air raids targeting energy infrastructure, he said defence lines in some areas were proving inefficient.\n\nEnergy Minister Denys Shmyhal, writing on Telegram after the daily meeting of officials on energy issues, said crews were working around the clock to restore heating in Kyiv, where night-time ‌temperatures were set to hit -19 Celsius (-2 Fahrenheit).\n\nAfter meeting with ​the top brass, Zelenskiy said Kharkiv and Poltava regions ​in central and northeastern Ukraine were ​also having difficulties with electricity, as well as parts of Odesa ‌region on the Black Sea.\n\nHe renewed criticism ​of decision-makers in Kyiv, ​where he has been at odds with Mayor Vitali Klitschko, as well as in his hometown of Kryvyi Rih and Okhtyrka near the Russian border.\n\n\"Every community leader and ​responsible service must pay real ‌attention to what is happening with buildings, with networks,\" he said. \"We are monitoring ​at all levels and people will be held personally responsible.\"",

    "description": "Think GPS runs the world? China's BeiDou is a fast-rising rival with military and disaster uses, plus a rapidly expanding satellite and ground network.",
    "fullText": "The term \"GPS\" has become ubiquitous in American life. You know it as the foundational technology of navigation apps like Google Maps and Waze, but in most of the world, GPS is just a meaningless trio of letters. The Global Positioning System is owned and operated by the U.S. military, and it is just one of many Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in operation around the world. In the European Union, people find their way with help from a GNSS called Galileo. In Russia, they use GLONASS (GLObal NAvigation Satellite System). Japan has QZSS (Quasi-Zenith Satellite System), commonly known as Michibiki. But there's one system that matters more than people realize: China's BeiDou isn't just a GPS alternative, it's a fast-growing platform with uses that go far beyond navigation.\n\nThe first BeiDou satellites launched in 2000, and by 2020, it had achieved global coverage. Just like America's GPS, BeiDou is owned and operated by its home government, and the ruling Chinese Communist Party has kept most of its technological specifications secret. However, BeiDou has caught the attention of other governments, particularly the United States, due to its wide-ranging uses. BeiDou does a lot more than guide people on their way to work. Just as GPS is closely tied into the American military, BeiDou is becoming ingrained in China's military operations, used by guided missiles and bombs. It's also being used for monitoring and responding to natural disasters. BeiDou is already more advanced than GPS in many ways, and it's grown at a stunning pace.\n\nBeiDou is much younger than GPS, which first launched in 1978 and achieved full coverage in 1993. However, the Chinese government has pursued progress on its GNSS much more aggressively than the United States. BeiDou was born with a competitive spirit, as part of a push to bolster China's military wing, the People's Liberation Army, at the end of the last century.\n\nA defining moment for China's GNSS ambitions came amidst the 1996 Taiwan Strait missile crisis, when tensions between the Chinese and Taiwanese governments led to the PLA conducting a series of missile tests in the East China Sea. During one of the tests, the Chinese missiles missed their targets badly. They had been relying on a GPS signal that went out, and Chinese officials later suggested the signal had been disrupted. The CCP resolved at that moment to develop a GNSS independent of, and superior to, the Americans'. From the beginning, national defense, and particularly missile guidance, was at the forefront of BeiDou.\n\nSince the 2010s, BeiDou has played a major role in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a massive infrastructure project aimed at expanding trade routes across the Eastern Hemisphere. In the process, China has begun heavily promoting BeiDou on the international scale. Their partnership with the military of Pakistan in 2018 drew particular attention. Amidst a steady air of tension between Beijing and Washington, China's ability to fortify its allies' militaries will have immense geopolitical consequences in any form of conflict.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States has been steadily rolling out GPS III. It will be an upgrade over the currently available GPS system, but it will probably still fall short of BeiDou on most fronts. GPS III will add more satellites to the GPS constellation, but the new satellites are only an incremental upgrade over what's already in use. In fact, GPS III was originally intended to launch in 2014, so the system is already outdated in some ways — and the first satellites for its planned successor, GPS IIIF, aren't scheduled to launch until Spring 2027.\n\nBeiDou has raised alarms within the U.S. government amidst a tight competition with Beijing for tech superiority that has already shown the Chinese can outmatch our drone technology. Perhaps the most concerning comment about BeiDou came from within the U.S. government itself, in a memo from former Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen from 2023, which plainly said, \"GPS's capabilities are now substantially inferior to those of China's BeiDou.\"\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "description": "As the Pentagon struggles with financial accountability, the Marines have passed their third audit in a row.",
    "fullText": "The Marine Corps has again done what the rest of the US military has repeatedly failed to do with its finances — account for its money.\n\nThe Corps, the only US military service to pass a clean financial audit, announced its third successful audit on Monday.\n\nThe Department of Defense, which was recently authorized to receive a new annual budget of nearly $840 billion a year and could see a substantial increase to $1.5 trillion under the current Trump administration, has consistently failed to pass an audit since audits became legally required for the military in 2018.\n\nPentagon officials hope the military can get its books in order across the services and pass one by 2028.\n\n\"The Marine Corps' audit process enabled accurate global tracking and reporting of financial transactions, inventory of facilities, equipment and assets, and accounting for taxpayer dollars spent during the last fiscal year,\" read a Marine Corps release, \"The auditors also tested the Marine Corps' network, key business systems, and internal controls.\"\n\nThe result reflects years of effort to modernize financial and logistics systems that have long been siloed across units, making audits agonizingly challenging, said Lt. Gen. James Adams III, the deputy commandant for programs and resources, during a media roundtable. Such bottlenecks have been a long-standing problem across the Defense Department and are a major focus of Pentagon reforms.\n\n\"We want to modernize our systems so they're digitally connected, so that we can do audits in the future that are controls-based,\" said Adams, who is set to depart his position soon to lead the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n\nHistorically, fragmented military networks have made everything from force-wide equipment tracking to financial oversight difficult, requiring tedious manual reconciliations. While the Corps still relies heavily on human review, officials say automation and artificial intelligence are already reducing the burden.\n\n\"Right now, we still take a lot of data and move it onto a macro spreadsheet that our accountants are reviewing, and that's just a lot of work,\" said Edward Gardiner, the assistant deputy commandant for programs and resources. AI tools can help flag discrepancies and pinpoint errors, he said. Officials pointed to one automation system that saved 20,000 hours of painful reconciliation work.\n\nAuditors still found seven \"areas of weakness\" in the audit, a common feature even among organizations with clean audits, though Adams told reporters the Corps has prioritized fixes to those areas that pose the greatest risk to financial accuracy after its audits, rather than trying to eliminate all concerns at once.\n\n\"Passing our third consecutive audit is a direct reflection of who we are as Marines,\" the Corps' commandant, Gen. Eric Smith, said in a statement. \"Discipline, accountability, and stewardship are not administrative tasks; they are part of our warfighting culture.\"",

    "title": "This Sci-Fi US Navy Destroyer Is $8 Billion Of Military Tech Floating At Sea",
    "description": "Right out of a sci-fi movie, this US Navy stealth ship comes with an $8 billion price tag and an incredible level of high-tech weaponry and capability.",
    "fullText": "When the U.S. Navy commissioned its Zumwalt-class destroyer (DDG-1000) in 2016, it hailed the warship as the most advanced surface combatant in the world. Equipped with a state-of-the-art stealth design, revolutionary electric propulsion and integrated power mechanisms, and twin Advanced Gun Systems, the 16,000-ton Zumwalt was touted as being larger, more advanced, and more difficult to detect than any destroyer the world had ever seen.\n\nHowever, several shortcomings, including runaway costs and underwhelming performance, caused the Navy to reduce order numbers from the proposed 32 to three, raising doubts in the Navy's ability to deliver advanced warships. Ultimately, the Zumwalt suffered from two major problems. The first was its incredible cost, as the $8 billion per-ship price tag made it impractical for largescale manufacturing and deployment. Second, its advanced designs were poorly suited for the Navy's intended usage as a land support ship, where stealth features are less important. As such, U.S. leadership determined the Zumwalt was an expensive square peg for the Navy's shore-support round hole, rendering it a floating money pit without a definitive mission.\n\nThis disconnect prompted the U.S. Navy to begin the arduous task of updating its most expensive destroyer, replacing the 155mm guns with hypersonic missiles. The first ship of its kind to sport an intercontinental missile system, the Zumwalt is one of a host of global destroyers adding high-tech weapons systems to address a changing threat landscape. The update recasts the Zumwalt as part of the U.S.'s long range strike operations, an increasingly important strategic priority, perhaps best exemplified by the nuclear missile test in November 2025. Having completed a round of post-modernization sea trials in January 2026, this sci-fi stealth ship may finally be ready to take its place at the head of U.S. Naval strategy.\n\nWhen the DDG-1000 was commissioned, it was lauded for its novel stealth designs. Despite constituting an approximate 40% jump in size from its Arleigh Burke-class predecessor, the 610-foot Zumwalt's radar cross section matches that of a 50-foot fishing vessel. Employing many of the same stealth design principles of fighter jets, the Zumwalt eschewed typical design structures, instead using an angular, wave-piercing tumblehome hull and a deckhouse constructed of electromagnetic wave-absorbing composite materials to lower the ship's radar footprint.\n\nAdd acoustics that more closely resemble a submarine, and the Zumwalt is roughly 50 times more clandestine than the Arleigh Burke destroyers. Another major development was the Zumwalt's electric propulsion system. Powered by a revolutionary integrated power network, it's capable of generating 78 megawatts, nearly as much as a nuclear aircraft carrier.\n\nThe massive size allows the Zumwalt to host a diverse array of aircraft, including Joint Strike Fighters, drones, and MV-22 Osprey, initially seen as a boon for its position alongside amphibious and littoral combat ships. To support these near-shore operations, the ship was equipped with two 155mm Advanced Gun Systems (AGS). With a range of 62 nautical miles, the Navy intended the AGS' Long-Range Land Attack Projectiles to fill the Naval Surface Fire Support void left by the 1992 retirement of the Iowa-class battleship.\n\nUnfortunately, the technological advancements of the Navy's sci-fi stealth ship came at a price. Over its 11-year development, costs skyrocketed to$23 billion. To put such astronomical numbers in perspective, the US Navy's new nuclear supercarrier, the Gerald R. Ford-class, costs $13 billion. Ammunition alone proved a financial disaster for the Zumwalt, as each round cost over $800,000, forcing a purchase cut from 20,000 to 2,400 units.\n\nFurther complicating things, the Zumwalt's expensive stealth advancements were ill-suited for the Navy's planned near-shore use, where crowded waterways and clear sightlines nullify much of its anti-radar capability. Between rising costs and competing design priorities, Naval planners largely viewed the Zumwalt-class destroyers as an expensive ship without a mission. Since canceling its ammunition order, however, the Navy has begun to reorient the Zumwalt away from close shore combat and towards clandestine operations and long range missile strikes.\n\nThis repurposing began in August 2023, when the DDG-1000 underwent a 3-year modernization effort.  Part of which involved replacing the Advanced Gun Systems with a state-of-the-art Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) weapons system that carries Common Hypersonic Glide Bodies capable of worldwide range at speeds up to Mach 5. Through these efforts, the Navy hopes that the CPS system will shift the Zumwalt-class destroyer into a key cog of its global force-projection efforts, particularly in the Pacific theatre.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "description": "Somali president promises to confront Israeli military presence amid reports of base plan in breakaway Somaliland.",
    "fullText": "Somalian President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud has slammed Israel’s “interference” in his country, saying its recognition of the breakaway region of Somaliland has further increased instability and weakened international order.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Al Jazeera broadcast on Saturday, Mohamud said Somalia “will never allow” the establishment of an Israeli base in Somaliland and will “confront” any such move.\n\nHe also warned that the proposed Israeli base could be used as a springboard to attack neighbouring countries.\n\nMohamud’s comments came amid a regional outcry over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision in December to recognise Somaliland, a breakaway part of Somalia comprising the northwestern portion of what was once the British Protectorate.\n\nThe territory sits astride one of the world’s most critical maritime choke routes, flanked by multiple conflicts in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East.\n\nIsrael’s move made it the first country in the world to recognise Somaliland as an independent state and came months after The Associated Press news agency reported that Israeli officials had contacted parties in Somaliland to discuss using the territory for forcibly displacing Palestinians amid Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.\n\nIsrael and Somaliland have denied the claims, but a Somaliland official from the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation told Israel’s Channel 12 in January that an Israeli military base is “on the table and being discussed”, though its establishment depends on the terms.\n\nSomalia has denounced Israel’s move as an attack on its territorial integrity and unity, a position backed by most African and Arab leaders, and urged Netanyahu to withdraw the recognition.\n\nBut Somaliland’s leader, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, known as Cirro, has welcomed Israel’s diplomatic move, praising Netanyahu for his “leadership and commitment to promoting stability and peace” in the region.\n\nIn his interview with Al Jazeera, Mohamud described Israel’s diplomatic manoeuvre as a “reckless, fundamentally wrong and illegal action under international law”.\n\nHe also pledged to fight back against any Israeli military presence in Somaliland.\n\n“We will fight in our capacity. Of course, we will defend ourselves,” he said. “And that means that we will confront any Israeli forces coming in, because we are against that and we will never allow that.”\n\nThe Israeli recognition represents a dramatic shift in Somaliland’s fortunes after years of diplomatic isolation.\n\nThe region seceded from Somalia during a brutal civil war that followed decades under the hardline government of Siad Barre, whose forces devastated the north. While large parts of Somalia descended into chaos, Somaliland stabilised by the late 1990s.\n\nSomaliland has since developed a distinct political identity, with its own currency, flag and parliament. But its eastern regions remain disputed by communities that do not back the separatist programme in the capital, Hargeisa.\n\nIn recent years, Somaliland developed ties with the United Arab Emirates – a signatory to the Abraham Accords with Israel – and Taiwan as it sought international acceptance.\n\nIn his interview, Mohamud said Israel’s move “interfering with Somalia’s sovereign and territorial integrity” also “undermines stability, security and trade in a way that affects the whole of Africa, the Red Sea and the wider world”.\n\nHe added that Israel’s deadly use of force against Palestinians in Gaza cannot be separated from what is happening in Somaliland, adding that it reflects the weakening of the foundations of global governance.\n\n“Key among the global concerns is the weakening of the established rules-based international order. That order is not intact any more,” Mohamud said.\n\nHe warned that institutions created after World War II “are under grave threat”, as “the mighty is right” increasingly replaces adherence to international law.\n\nThe United States, meanwhile, has yet to signal a major shift on the question of Somaliland.\n\nBut in August, US President Donald Trump – who has previously lobbed insults at Somalia and Mohamud – suggested he was preparing to move on the issue when asked about Somaliland during a White House news conference.\n\n“Another complex one, but we’re working on that one – Somaliland,” he said.",

This included the F-35 Lightning II, the latest U.S.-made fifth-generation fighter jet that has integrated stealth technology and is considered one of the world’s most advanced combat aircraft.\n\nMajor commercial plane makers also touted the latest advancements in their fleets, including Airbus, Bombardier, Gulfstream, Boeing and China’s Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, known as COMAC.\n\n“We have a very good representation of the latest and the greatest,” said Leck Chet Lam, managing director of Experia Events, which organizes the event. “The Singapore Air Show, the unique part of it is we cover both the aviation and also the defense industries.”\n\nDuring the Singapore Air Show's aerial displays, COMAC promoted its C919 passenger jet, which China is pushing as an alternative to the European Airbus A320neo and the American Boeing 737 MAX. The daily aerial displays at the event also showcased six military teams and Airbus’ A350-1000.\n\nWithin the exhibition hall, the air show featured experimental air taxis, advanced flight simulators, a wide variety of drones and both manned and unmanned helicopters. The static aircraft display under Singapore’s sizzling sun included roughly 35 planes from more than 10 countries.\n\nIn all, more than 1,000 companies from around 50 countries participated in the air show, hosted on the grounds of Changi International Airport, Southeast Asia's busiest airport. The event, which opened on Feb. 3, is considered Asia’s largest aerospace and defense exhibition and runs through Feb. 8.\n\n“All the exhibitors can use Singapore as a springboard to then tap into the opportunities that are rising in the Asia-Pacific market, which is a key driver that is driving the growth of the global aviation industry,\" Lam said.\n\nThis is a photo gallery curated by AP photo editors.",

    "title": "Hunt For Container Launchers Packed With Drones Kicked-Off By Pentagon",
    "description": "The U.S. military wants proposals for containerized systems that can launch and recover a mixture of drone swarms on land and sea.",
    "fullText": "The entire U.S. military is now pushing to acquire hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of new drones, especially smaller types, in the coming years, spurred on by new direction from the Pentagon. In turn, a demand for new containerized launchers capable of rapidly deploying and, if need be, recovering those uncrewed aerial systems has now emerged. On several occasions in the past, TWZ has called attention to the value of exactly these kinds of launch capabilities, for use on land and at sea, especially for employing fully networked swarms.\n\nEarlier this week, the Pentagon’s Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) laid out broad requirements for what it referred to as a Containerized Autonomous Drone Delivery System (CADDS). DIU’s central focus is on leveraging new and improved commercial-off-the-shelf technologies to help meet U.S. military needs.\n\n“The Department of War (DoW) faces a robotic mass challenge: current methods for deploying and sustaining unmanned aerial systems (UAS) rely on direct human interaction to launch, recover, and refit each system,” the CADDS notice explains. “This 1:1 operator-to-aircraft model limits deployment speed and scale while exposing operators to unnecessary risks.”\n\nThe “problem” to solve then is that “the DoW requires the ability to deploy large quantities of UAS rapidly, while minimizing the risk and burden to human operators executing kinetic and non-kinetic UAS operations in contested environments,” it adds.\n\nTo that end, “DOW seeks innovative solutions that enable the storage, rapid deployment, and management of multi-agent systems to provide either persistent UAS coverage over extended periods or massed effects within a single geographic region and time,” per DIU. It needs to be “employable from land and maritime platforms, in both day and night conditions, and during inclement weather.”\n\nThese have to be “designs [that] can be transported by military or commercial vehicles (land, sea, air)” and that “can be quickly positioned and made operational with minimal handling or setup.” They also have to be able to provide “automated functions for drone storage, launching, recovering, and refitting within the containerized platform; the intent is for the system to exist in a dormant state for a period of time and launch UAS upon command.”\n\nDIU does not name any particular drones that the CADDS has to be able to accommodate or say how many UASs a single launcher should be able to hold. The notice does say the system will need to support “homogeneous and heterogeneous mixes of Government-directed UAS.”\n\nThe launch system also has to be capable of being set up and broken back down in a time frame measured in minutes and have a small operational footprint. “Ideally, the system should require a crew of no more than 2 personnel,” per DIU.\n\nWhen it comes to the “autonomous” element of the launch system, DIU says it needs to support “both operator-on-the-loop and operator-in-the-loop decision-making processes.”\n\nThe market space for containerized launchers for various payloads, and for use on land and at sea, has been steadily growing globally in recent years. There has already been a further trend in the development of such systems for launching loitering munitions and other uncrewed aerial systems, or the adaptation of existing designs to be able to do so.\n\nAs one example, in the past year or so, Northrop Grumman has begun touting the ability of what it is currently calling the Modular Payload System (MPS) to launch drones, as seen in the computer-generated video below. TWZ was first to report on the development of that system all the way back in 2018, when it was being presented solely as a way to surface-launch variants of the AGM-88 anti-radiation missile. MPS is also now being pitched as a launcher for the Advanced Reactive Strike Missile (AReS), a surface-to-surface missile derived from the AGM-88G Advanced Anti-radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range (AARGM-ER) and its Stand-in Attack Weapon (SiAW) cousin.\n\nLast year, another concept for a containerized launcher capable of holding up to 48 drones at once also emerged from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Japan. Back in 2024, Germany’s Rheinmetall and UVision in Israel had also unveiled two very similar designs, specifically for launching members of the latter company’s Hero series of loitering munitions.\n\nA containerized “drone launch vehicle” based on a 10-ton truck, capable of carrying and launching up to 48 attack drones, as showcased by\n\nMitsubishi Heavy Industries. https://t.co/DlkG1X0OLLhttps://t.co/0vhaWlpRwopic.twitter.com/khFY25YESx\n\n— 笑脸男人 (@lfx160219) December 19, 2025\n\nThis is just a small selection of the designs that have been seen to date. Firms in China have been particularly active in this regard, and developments in that country have often also been tied to work on swarming capabilities.\n\nContainer-like launchers for uncrewed aerial systems, often mounted on trucks, have already been in service in many countries for years. This includes Iran, where they are used to launch Shahed-type kamikaze drones, as can be seen in the video below.\n\nHowever, many of these systems are focused squarely on the launch aspect and lack the recovery and refit capabilities that DIU has outlined for CADDS. Chinese drone firm DJI and others in the commercial space are increasingly offering container-like ‘docks,’ but which are often designed to accommodate just one uncrewed aerial system at a time.\n\nWhat is particularly interesting here is how many of the stated CADDS requirements actually sound very similar, at least in very broad strokes, to a containerized system capable of launching, recovering, and recharging thousands of small, electrically-powered quadcopter-type drones at the touch of a button that the Chinese company DAMODA rolled out last year. That launcher, dubbed the Automated Drone Swarm Container System, is for drone light shows for entertainment purposes rather than military use.\n\nIt is worth reiterating that DAMODA’s Automated Drone Swarm Container System, at least as it exists now, is clearly designed for entertainment industry use first and foremost. Though the company’s drone light show routines are certainly visually impressive and often go viral on social media, they are pre-scripted and conducted in a very localized fashion. What the company is offering is not a drone swarm capable of performing various military-minded tasks in a highly autonomous manner at appreciable ranges from its launch point.\n\nAt the same time, large-scale drone light shows put on by DAMODA (and a growing number of other companies), do highlight, on a broad level, the already highly problematic threats posed by swarms. The new Automated Drone Swarm Container System underscores the additional danger of these same threats hiding in plain sight. The steady proliferation of advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, especially when it comes to dynamic targeting, will only create additional challenges, as TWZ has explored in detail in this past feature.\n\nThis is not theoretical, either. As mentioned, in June [2025], Ukrainian forces launched multiple drone attacks on airbases across Russia with the help of covert launchers loaded on the back of unassuming civilian tractor-trailer trucks. This entire effort was dubbed Operation Spiderweb and took months of planning.\n\n5/\n\n5. After launching, the trailers self-destructed to avoid detection or recovery . pic.twitter.com/DWZo4HlOfa\n\nEven in an overt operational context, readily deployable containerized systems capable of acting as hubs for drone operations across a broad area with limited manpower requirements could offer a major boost in capability and capacity. Ships, trucks, and aircraft, which could themselves be uncrewed, could be used to bring them to and from forward locations, even in remote areas. If they can support a “heterogeneous mix” of uncrewed aerial systems, a single container could be used to support a wide array of mission requirements, including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, electronic warfare, kinetic strikes, and/or communications signal relay.\n\nAn inherent benefit of a drone swarm, in general, is that each individual component does not have to be configured to perform all of the desired tasks. This creates additional flexibility and resilience to threats, since the loss of any particular drone does not necessarily preclude the swarm from continuing its assigned missions. There are tangential design and cost benefits for the drones themselves, since they can be configured to carry only the systems required for their particular mission demands.\n\nTWZ previously laid out a detailed case for the many benefits that could come along with loading containers packed with swarms of drones onto U.S. Navy ships. Many of those arguments are just as relevant when talking about systems designed to be employed on land. Containerized systems are often readily adaptable to both ground-based and maritime applications, to begin with.\n\nDrone swarms are only set to become more capable as advancements in autonomy, especially automated target recognition, continue to progress, driven by parallel developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning, as you can read more about here. Future highly autonomous swarms will be able to execute various mission sets even more efficiently and in ways that compound challenges for defenders. Massed drone attacks with limited autonomy already have an inherent capacity to just overwhelm enemy defenses. In turn, electronic warfare systems and high-power microwave directed energy weapons have steadily emerged as some of the most capable options available to tackle swarms, but have their own limitations. Even powerful microwave systems have very short ranges and are directional in nature, and electronic warfare systems may simply not work at all against autonomous drones.\n\nIn terms of what DIU is now looking at for CADDS, the stated requirements are broad. It remains to be seen what options might be submitted, let alone considered for actual operational U.S. military use.\n\nStill, DIU has laid out a real emerging capability gap amid the current push to field various tiers of drones to a degree never before seen across America’s armed forces, which counterinsurgency launch systems look well-positioned to fill.\n\nContact the author: joe@twz.com",

    "fullText": "The Pentagon said Friday it is cutting ties with Harvard University, ending all military training, fellowships and certificate programs with the Ivy League institution.\n\nThe announcement marks the latest development in the Trump administration’s prolonged standoff with Harvard over the White House’s demands for reforms at the Ivy League school.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a statement Friday that Harvard “no longer meets the needs of the War Department or the military services.\"\n\n“For too long, this department has sent our best and brightest officers to Harvard, hoping the university would better understand and appreciate our warrior class,” Hegseth said. “Instead, too many of our officers came back looking too much like Harvard — heads full of globalist and radical ideologies that do not improve our fighting ranks.”\n\nIn a separate post on X, Hegseth wrote, “Harvard is woke; The War Department is not.”\n\nStarting with the 2026-27 academic year, the Pentagon will discontinue graduate-level professional military education, fellowships and certificate programs, the statement said. Personnel currently attending classes at Harvard will be able to finish those courses.\n\nSimilar programs at other Ivy League universities will be evaluated in coming weeks, Hegseth said.\n\nHegseth earned a master's degree from Harvard but symbolically returned his diploma in a 2022 Fox News segment. A Pentagon social media account run by Hegseth’s office resurfaced the clip in which Hegseth, then a Fox News commentator, returned the diploma and wrote “Return to Sender” on it with a marker.\n\nThe military offers its officers a variety of opportunities to get graduate-level education both at war colleges run by the military as well as civilian institutions like Harvard.\n\nBroadly, while opportunities to attend prestigious civilian schools offer less direct benefit to a servicemember’s military career than their civilian counterparts, they help make troops more attractive employees once they leave the military.\n\nHarvard has long been President Donald Trump’s top target in his administration’s campaign to bring the nation’s most prestigious universities to heel. His officials have cut billions of dollars in Harvard’s federal research funding and attempted to block it from enrolling foreign students after the campus rebuffed a series of government demands last April.\n\nThe White House has said it’s punishing Harvard for tolerating anti-Jewish bias on campus. Harvard leaders argue they're facing illegal retaliation for failing to adopt the administration's ideological views. Harvard sued the administration in a pair of lawsuits. A federal judge issued orders siding with Harvard in both cases. The administration is appealing.\n\nTensions had eased over the summer as Trump teased a deal that he said was just days away. It never materialized and on Monday the president dug deeper, demanding $1 billion from Harvard as part of any deal to restore federal funding. That's twice what he had demanded before.\n\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations. AP is solely responsible for all content.

With space between the headstones busy with mourners, Alshrafi set up at the far end of the cemetery, “because I know that sometimes the explosions are very strong, so we need to always stay vigilant.”\n\nHis images reinforce that very real danger. In the first, an Israeli bomb is frozen in midair, just a few feet from striking its target, as cemetery visitors turn to flee.\n\nIn the frames that follow, an immense plume of flames and smoke erupts from the structure.

    "fullText": "A high-profile general in Russia's military has been shot several times and wounded in Moscow.\n\nLt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev, 64, was taken to hospital after the attack in a residential block of flats in the north-western outskirts of the capital, and is believed to be in a serious condition. The attacker fled the scene.\n\nAlexeyev is number two in the main directorate of Russia's GRU military intelligence and the latest high-ranking military figure to have been targeted in or near Moscow since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nNo-one has so far claimed the attack, but senior Russian officials immediately blamed Ukraine, saying it was trying to derail negotiations to end the war.\n\n\"The victim has been taken to one of the city's hospitals,\" said Svetlana Petrenko of Russia's Investigations Committee (SK), which said it opened a criminal case for attempted murder.\n\nInvestigators are searching CCTV footage for clues and began interviewing potential witnesses of the attack on Friday morning on Volokolamsk Highway.\n\nA neighbour of Alexeyev told the Reuters news agency she had been woken by the sound of \"several\" shots and had then heard another neighbour screaming for help.\n\n\"This is all I heard. Other neighbours rushed out, too. They asked how they could help, should they call ambulance and police, but she had already called them.\"\n\nAlexeyev has played a significant role during the war in Ukraine, taking part in talks with Ukraine during the Russian siege of the city of Mariupol in 2022.\n\nEarlier he was awarded the title Hero of Russia for the role he played in Moscow's military intervention in Syria's civil war.\n\nHe was placed under European Union and UK sanctions after the GRU was accused of being behind the 2018 nerve agent attack in Salisbury in the UK.\n\nHe was also sent to negotiate with the head of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who led a short and bloody mutiny in June 2023.\n\nHis boss at the GRU, Igor Kostyukov, has been in charge of Russia's negotiating team at peace talks with Ukrainian and US teams in Abu Dhabi. The latest round ended on Thursday without a major breakthrough.\n\nIt is not yet known who was behind the shooting - but Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quick to accuse Ukraine.\n\nHe said \"this terrorist act\" was aimed at \"disrupting the negotiation process\".\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Vladimir Putin was being briefed on the shooting. \"We wish first of all that the general survives and recovers. We hope that will be the case,\" Peskov told reporters.\n\nUkraine has not commented but has claimed some attacks on Russian military figures in the past. Russian intelligence officials claimed they had thwarted an attempted attack on a Russian soldier in St Petersburg at the end of last month.\n\nAn Uzbek man was jailed in January for the 2024 killing of another general, Igor Kirillov, in an explosion outside a block of flats in Moscow. Sources in Ukraine's SBU intelligence said at the time it was behind the attack.\n\nLt Gen Kirillov had been in charge of Russia's Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection troops.\n\nIn December 2025, another high-ranking officer in the GRU, Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov, was killed when an explosive device detonated under a car in Moscow. He was in charge of the armed force's operational training department, according to Russia's SK.",

    "fullText": "A CORUNA, Spain, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Around a third of countries attending a military AI summit agreed on Thursday to a a declaration ​on how to govern deployment of the technology in warfare, but military ‌heavyweights China and the U.S. opted out.\n\nTensions in relations between the United States and European allies, and uncertainty ‌over how transatlantic ties will look in coming months and years, made some countries hesitant to sign joint agreements, several attendees and delegates said.\n\nThe pledge underscores growing concern among some governments that rapid advances in artificial intelligence could outpace rules around its military use, raising the ⁠risk of accidents, miscalculation or ‌unintended escalation.\n\nGovernments are facing a \"prisoner's dilemma\", caught between putting responsible restrictions in place and not wanting to limit themselves in comparison with adversaries, ‍said Dutch Defence Minister Ruben Brekelmans.\n\n\"Russia and China are moving very fast. That creates urgency to make progress in developing AI. But seeing it going fast also increases the urgency to keep ​working on its responsible use. The two go hand-in-hand,\" he said in comments to ‌Reuters.\n\nOnly 35 countries out of 85 attending the Responsible AI in the Military Domain (REAIM) summit in A Coruna, Spain, on signed a commitment to 20 principles on AI on Thursday.\n\nThese included affirming human responsibility over AI-powered weapons, encouraging clear chains of command and control, and sharing information on national oversight arrangements \"where consistent with national security\".\n\nThe document also outlined the ⁠importance of risk assessments, robust testing and training ​and education for personnel operating military AI capabilities.\n\nAt two ​prior military AI summits in The Hague and Seoul in 2023 and 2024 respectively, around 60 nations, excluding China but including the United States, ‍endorsed a modest \"blueprint ⁠for action\" without legal commitment.\n\nWhile this year's document was also non-binding, some were still uncomfortable with the idea of endorsing more concrete policies, said Yasmin Afina, a ⁠researcher at the U.N. Institute for Disarmament Research, an adviser on the process.\n\nMajor signatories on Thursday included ‌Canada, Germany, France, Britain, the Netherlands, South Korea and Ukraine.",

    "description": "The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Thursday that Russia’s Starlink satellite internet terminals in Ukraine have been “cut off,” disrupting Russian military communications.",
    "fullText": "The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Thursday that Russia’s Starlink satellite internet terminals in Ukraine have been “cut off,” disrupting Russian military communications.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said SpaceX, which owns Starlink, is working with Ukraine to update a “whitelist” of approved and verified Starlink terminals, while unapproved Russian systems have been blocked.\n\n“The Starlink terminals added to the ‘whitelist’ are working. The Russians’ terminals have already been blocked,” Fedorov said in a statement Thursday. “We continue to verify Starlink terminals. The first batch of terminals that made it onto the ‘whitelist’ are already operational.”\n\nA source at the General Staff of the Ukrainian armed forces claimed that “all Russian Starlinks have been cut off” along the front line as of Thursday evening local time.\n\nUnder US sanctions, Starlink cannot be sold to or used by Russia. However, analysts and Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia has increasingly been finding ways to leverage the system to its own advantage. CNN previously reported on Russia’s practice of mounting Starlink systems on its attack drones, which allow the weapons to bypass Ukraine’s electronic defenses that disable drones by jamming GPS and radio signals, and to strike deeper into the country.\n\nUkraine has also relied heavily on Starlink since the beginning the war, using it to operate military communications and drones, as well as information systems for public institutions like hospitals and schools.\n\n“The enemy on the front lines is facing not just a problem, but a catastrophe. All command and control of the troops has collapsed. Assault operations have been halted in many areas,” said Serhii Beskrestnov, an adviser to the defense minister.\n\nElon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, said earlier this week that it was taking steps to stop Russia’s “unauthorized” use of the Starlink satellite internet constellation. Musk reiterated Thursday that it’s “important to register your Starlink terminal if in Ukraine.”\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Defense has not addressed the claims of Starlink disruptions.\n\nBut Russian military bloggers began commenting on the Starlink outages on Wednesday and Thursday, noting that Russia’s internet and communications capabilities on the front line have taken a hit.\n\nOne pro-Kremlin military blogger, Boris Rozhin, wrote a Q&A-style post on Telegram, saying, “Yes, it will have a certain impact on internet availability in the field,” and “yes, there are no alternatives at all, right now.” He also claimed that Russian forces were working to bypass the block and to bring high-speed internet to the field using other methods.\n\nAnother Russian military blog, which supports the airborne special forces, tried to downplay the disruption, writing: “The Starlinks may have been shut down, but the backup communications are still there. The radios are working, and there’s communication between the positions.”\n\nSome Starlink units used by the Ukrainian side were also reportedly cut off, although it’s unclear how widespread the disruption is, as the government continues the whitelisting process.\n\nOne Ukrainian combat officer, Tetiana Chornovol, posted on social media that “the shutdown of Starlink left my two combat positions without communication,” adding that her unit has since brought in an alternative communication system.\n\n“It works for us,” a Ukrainian drone pilot said in a video posted to Telegram. “We immediately registered our Starlink terminal, and everything is fine.”\n\nMeanwhile, the second round of trilateral talks between Ukraine, Russia and the United States concluded in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.\n\nUkrainian presidential chief of staff Kyrylo Budanov, who was part of his country’s delegation, described the negotiations as “truly constructive.”\n\n“I am grateful to the US and the UAE for their high-quality organization and mediation,” Budanov told the Ukrainian news agency RBC-Ukraine.\n\nWhile no breakthrough deal came out of the two days of talks, Russia and Ukraine did agree to conduct their first prisoner exchange since October. Each returned 157 prisoners of war to the other side on Thursday, according to Russian state news agency TASS and US negotiator Steve Witkoff.\n\n“While significant work remains, steps like this demonstrate that sustained diplomatic engagement is delivering tangible results and advancing efforts to end the war in Ukraine,” Witkoff said Thursday in a post on X.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the negotiators agreed to hold another round of talks “in the near future.”\n\nCNN’s Ivana Kottasová, Daria Tarasova-Markina and Sophie Tanno contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Feb 6 (Reuters) - China used this week's Singapore Airshow to flex its military and aviation muscle, drawing heavy attention from regional delegations as Beijing sharpens its bid for influence in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe U.S. military has demonstrated its power this year through the precision extraction of ​Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and a major naval buildup around Iran. Yet President Donald Trump has been vocal in his criticism of some of U.S. ‌allies and imposed tariffs on them, creating an opening for China.\n\nWhile China's fighter jets and commercial airliners remain far from achieving mass-market international adoption, their makers appeared more assertive and confident and enjoyed greater ‌visibility this year at Asia's largest air show.\n\nThe PLA Air Force's aerobatic team made a headline-grabbing show debut of its Chengdu J-10C fighter jets, an aircraft whose export variant, the J-10CE, surged to prominence in 2025 when customer Pakistan used it to shoot down an Indian Air Force French Rafale.\n\nChinese state media reported the team had used mid-air refuelling to fly directly to Singapore for the high-profile deployment.\n\n\"That's a bit of a message to say: Our power projection is growing,\" said Tim Robinson, editor-in-chief of the Royal ⁠Aeronautical Society's Aerospace magazine.\n\n\"It's one of the key enablers ‌a modern air force should have. Previously people said this is one of their weaknesses.\"\n\nInside the sweltering air show's air-conditioned halls, Chinese state companies occupied a prime spot with brightly lit displays dominated by a 1:2 scale model of AVIC's J-35A stealth multirole ‍fighter. Little is known about the latest addition to Chinese air power, which was first seen domestically in 2024.\n\nNo technical data was displayed, but observers of the global arms marketplace said the message to Asia's buyers was evident.\n\n\"That's obviously positioned to say: if you can't afford an F-35 or are banned from buying an F-35 we've got an alternative,\" Robinson said.\n\nSoutheast Asian defence officials crowded Chinese military and aerospace booths, underscoring Beijing’s growing pull as it aggressively markets hardware across the region.\n\nThe show of strength ‌landed at a politically sensitive moment, with Southeast Asian governments increasingly uneasy about U.S. security commitments amid a more isolationist Washington under Trump, analysts and Western officials said.\n\n\"We see the same delegations as before but the conversation has changed,\" said a senior official at a Western arms company.\n\nIndustry-watchers are cautious about any sudden switch of arms trade but agree the backdrop reflects the new power politics and the diversification of supply chains.\n\n\"The Chinese arms companies may think that, if other countries have lost confidence in buying American, there's an opportunity for China,\" said China defence specialist Bradley Perrett.\n\n\"But most of the U.S.' customers, if they want to look elsewhere, will look ⁠at European, South Korean and Japanese equipment.\"\n\nAsia's arms spending is growing apace as countries respond ​to a sustained build-up from an increasingly assertive China.\n\nChina's efforts to penetrate the airliner ​market, grabbing share from Airbus and Boeing, are proceeding slowly due in part to the lengthy process of winning European certification.\n\nBut state-owned planemaker COMAC again flew the C919 narrowbody jet and advertised the future C929 wide-body in model form at the show. That is now ‍progressing through detailed design as a Chinese ⁠project after initially exploring a joint development with Russia.\n\nChinese delegates said that given the Singapore venue, COMAC was prioritising potential clients from Southeast Asia, and Indonesian attendees were among those inquiring about aircraft.\n\nChina's efforts to rival Airbus and Boeing are a national priority though Western analysts say it will take ⁠years if not decades to establish the global footprint and marketing support that helps the industry leaders maintain entrenched positions.\n\nBut delegates noted a broadening commercial assault at the show including the market ‌for alternative third-party spare parts, tapping into airline concerns about shortages at a time when supplies are strained across the globe.",

    "description": "The U.S. and Russia agreed Thursday to reestablish high-level military dialogue for the first time in more than four years in another sign of warming relations between the two countries since Presiden...",
    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The U.S. and Russia agreed Thursday to reestablish high-level military dialogue for the first time in more than four years in another sign of warming relations between the two countries since President Donald Trump returned to office and sought to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nHigh-level military communication was suspended in late 2021, as tension between Moscow and Washington rose ahead of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Trump then campaigned for a second term on promises that he would swiftly end the fighting. Many of his proposals for peace have heavily favored the Kremlin, including requiring Ukraine to cede territory to Russia.\n\nThe restored communication channel “will provide a consistent military-to-military contact as the parties continue to work towards a lasting peace,” the U.S. European Command said in a statement. The agreement emerged from a meeting between senior Russian and American military officials in the capital of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nU.S. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, who is the commander in Europe of both U.S. and NATO forces, was in Abu Dhabi, where talks between American, Russian and Ukrainian officials on ending the war entered a second day.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow escalated its attacks on Ukraine’s power grid in an apparent effort to deny civilians power and to weaken public support for the fight, while hostilities continued along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line snaking through eastern and southern parts of Ukraine.\n\nThe resumption of the military hotline marks an effort to ease tensions that soared after the start of the war and to avoid collisions between Russian and U.S. forces.\n\nIn one such incident in March 2023, the American military said it ditched an Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone in the Black Sea after a pair of Russian fighter jets dumped fuel on it, and then one of them struck its propeller while flying in international airspace.\n\nMoscow has denied that its warplanes hit the drone, alleging that it crashed while making a sharp maneuver. The Kremlin said its aircraft reacted to a violation of a no-fly zone Russia has established in the area near Crimea.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly voiced concern about intelligence flights by the U.S. and other NATO aircraft over the Black Sea, and some Russian officials charged that the American surveillance flights helped gather intelligence that allowed Ukraine to strike Russian targets.\n\nNATO members have been increasingly worried about intrusions into allied airspace. Some European officials described the incidents as Moscow testing NATO’s response.\n\nIn September, a swarm of Russian drones flew into Poland’s airspace, prompting NATO aircraft to scramble to intercept them and shoot down some of the devices. It was the first direct encounter between NATO and Moscow since the full-scale invasion. Later that month, NATO jets escorted three Russian warplanes out of Estonia’s airspace.\n\nRussia, Ukraine exchange prisoners following talks\n\nThe delegations from Moscow and Kyiv were joined Thursday in Abu Dhabi by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, according to Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council chief, who was present at the meeting.\n\nThey were also at last month's talks in the same place as the Trump administration tries to steer Russia and Ukraine toward a settlement.\n\nOfficials have provided no information about any progress in the discussions.\n\nFollowing the talks on Thursday, however, Russia and Ukraine said they carried out a prisoner exchange.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said it brought 157 Russian servicemen back from Ukrainian captivity, as well as three Russian nationals captured during Kyiv's incursion into Russia's Kursk region. Ukrainian officials said 150 Ukrainian servicemen and seven civilians returned from Russian captivity.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said the released Russian soldiers are currently in Belarus, getting medical assistance, before being taken back to Russia “for treatment and rehabilitation.”\n\nUkrainian human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said that among the 150 service members who returned from Russian captivity, 18 were \"illegally sentenced by Russia.” He said that “overall, those released are in a difficult psychological condition, and some are critically underweight.”\n\nZelenskyy says 55,000 Ukrainian troops killed in the war\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 55,000 Ukrainian troops have died since Russia’s invasion. “And there is a large number of people whom Ukraine considers missing,” he added in an interview broadcast late Wednesday by French TV channel France 2.\n\nThe last time Zelenskyy gave a figure for battlefield deaths, in early 2025, he said 46,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed.\n\nZelenskyy has repeatedly said his country needs security guarantees from the U.S. and Europe to deter any postwar Russian attacks.\n\nUkrainians must feel that there is genuine progress toward peace and “not toward a scenario in which the Russians exploit everything to their advantage and continue their strikes,” Zelenskyy said on social media late Wednesday.\n\nLast year saw a 31% increase in Ukrainian civilian casualties compared with 2024, the advocacy group Human Rights Watch said in a report published Wednesday.\n\nAlmost 15,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and just over 40,000 wounded since the start of the war through last December, according to the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine.\n\nRussian troops have lost access to their Starlink satellite internet terminals on the front line, Ukrainian Economic Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said Thursday, after Ukraine asked Elon Musk’s SpaceX to help deny Russia use of the service in Ukraine.\n\nRussian forces have consequently lost command-and-control capabilities and navigation for drones, and assaults have stopped in many sectors, according to Fedorov’s adviser Serhii Beskrestnov. Russian officials made no immediate comment.\n\nUkraine is registering its civilian and military Starlink users on a database, allowing approved devices to function while unregistered terminals are disabled inside Ukraine.\n\nAlso, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said during a visit to Kyiv that he agreed with Zelenskyy to develop the joint production of ammunition at plants in their countries.\n\nZelenskyy said Poland plans to increase supplies to Ukraine of liquefied natural gas, and the countries are exploring an exchange of weaponry, with Kyiv possibly receiving Polish MiG fighter jets and Warsaw receiving Ukrainian drones.\n\nRussia fired 183 drones and two ballistic missiles at Ukraine overnight, according to the Ukrainian air force. Three people were injured, officials said.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said its air defenses downed 95 Ukrainian drones overnight over several regions, the Azov Sea and Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014.\n\nThis story corrects an earlier version that said Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2016. The annexation happened in 2014.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "It was the story of the weekend: \"Melania,\" Amazon's documentary on first lady Melania Trump, beat expectations at the box office, becoming one of the best-performing documentaries in recent years with an opening weekend gross of $7 million across 1,778 screens. (Whether it makes back its $75 million investment is another story.)\n\nDespite dismal critic reviews, the numbers suggest audiences turned out for \"Melania\" to support the first lady. One advocacy group suggests the reality may be more complicated.\n\nMikey Weinstein, the president and founder of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, said the nonprofit received reports from eight bases around the world that U.S. military members were being \"pressured\" to see \"Melania.\"\n\n\"People are scared,\" said Weinstein, a former Air Force officer and attorney who said his group is made up of nearly 100,000 current and former members of the U.S. military and represents those who feel pressured or coerced into unconstitutional religious observances. \"They were pressured to see the movie.\"\n\n\"Your military superior, that's not your shift manager at Taco Bell or Starbucks. They have complete and total control over you.\"\n\nIn an email Weinstein shared with Business Insider, an active-duty enlisted member of the US military said they were writing on behalf of a dozen of their unit members and their families who felt \"pressured\" by their unit commander to see the movie. The MRFF did not disclose the name of the person who sent the email.\n\nIn the email, this person said their commander suggested the unit and their family members join him, his wife, and their children at a showing of \"Melania\" at an off-base movie theater.\n\nThe screening was designated as one of the commander's \"Unit Activity Events,\" morale-boosting activities that can range from flag football and barbecues to movie nights, the email said. The military member who sent the email said the unit is required to attend at least three of the four UAEs that are scheduled each month or face a penalty.\n\nAsked if any of the MRFF members who contacted him skipped the movie, Weinstein said: \"Every one of our clients who came to us either went to see it or suddenly got sick.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment, a Department of Defense official told Business Insider, \"There is no Department of War directive requiring service members to see this film, though the film is fantastic.\"",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan is refusing to voluntarily comply with a Justice Department investigation into a video she organized urging U.S. military members to resist “illegal orders” — escalating a dispute that President Donald Trump has publicly pushed.\n\nIn letters first obtained by The Associated Press, Slotkin’s lawyer informed U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro that the senator would not agree to a voluntary interview about the video. Slotkin's legal team also requested that Pirro preserve all documents related to the matter for “anticipated litigation.”\n\nSlotkin’s lawyer separately wrote to Attorney General Pam Bondi, declining to sit for an FBI interview about the video and urging her to immediately terminate any inquiry.\n\nThe refusal marks a potential turning point in the standoff, shifting the burden onto the Justice Department to decide whether it will escalate an investigation into sitting members of Congress or retreat from an inquiry now being openly challenged.\n\n“I did this to go on offense,” Slotkin said in an interview Wednesday. “And to put them in a position where they’re tap dancing. To put them in a position where they have to own their choices of using a U.S. attorney’s office to come after a senator.”\n\n‘It’s not gonna stop unless I fight back'\n\nLast November, Slotkin joined five other Democratic lawmakers — all of whom previously served in the military or at intelligence agencies — in posting a 90-second video urging U.S. service members to follow established military protocols and reject orders they believe to be unlawful.\n\nThe lawmakers said Trump's Republican administration was “pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens” and called on troops to “stand up for our laws.”\n\nThe video sparked a firestorm in Republican circles and soon drew the attention of Trump, who accused the lawmakers of sedition and said their actions were “punishable by death.”\n\nThe Pentagon later announced it had opened an investigation into Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, a former Navy pilot who appeared in the video. The FBI then contacted the lawmakers seeking interviews, signaling a broader Justice Department inquiry.\n\nSlotkin said multiple legal advisers initially urged caution.\n\n“Maybe if you keep quiet, this will all go away over Christmas,” Slotkin said she was told.\n\nBut in January, the matter flared again, with the lawmakers saying they were contacted by the U.S. attorney’s office for the District of Columbia.\n\nMeanwhile, security threats mounted. Slotkin said her farm in Michigan received a bomb threat, her brother was assigned a police detail due to threats and her parents were swatted in the middle of the night.\n\nHer father, who died in January after a long battle with cancer, “could barely walk and he’s dealing with the cops in his home,” she said.\n\nSlotkin said a “switch went off” in her and she became angry: “And I said, ‘It’s not gonna stop unless I fight back.’”\n\nDemocratic senators draw a line\n\nThe requests from the FBI and the Justice Department have been voluntary. Slotkin said that her legal team had communicated with prosecutors but that officials “keep asking for a personal interview.”\n\nSlotkin’s lawyer, Preet Bharara, in the letter to Pirro declined the interview request and asked that she “immediately terminate any open investigation and cease any further inquiry concerning the video.” In the other letter, Bharara urged Bondi to use her authority to direct Pirro to close the inquiry.\n\nBharara wrote that Slotkin’s constitutional rights had been infringed and said litigation is being considered.\n\n“All options are most definitely on the table,” Slotkin said. Asked whether she would comply with a subpoena, she paused before responding: “I’d take a hard look at it.”\n\nBharara, who's representing Slotkin in the case, is a former U.S. attorney in New York who was fired by Trump in 2017 during his first administration. He's also representing Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California in a separate case involving the Justice Department.\n\nKelly has similarly pushed back, suing the Pentagon last month over attempts to punish him for the video. On Tuesday, a federal judge said that he knows of no U.S. Supreme Court precedent to justify the Pentagon’s censuring of Kelly as he weighed whether to intervene.\n\nSlotkin said she's in contact with the other lawmakers who appeared in the video, but she wouldn't say what their plans were in the investigations.\n\nTrump has frequently and consistently targeted his political opponents. In some cases, those attacks have had the unintended consequence of elevating their national standing.\n\nIn Kelly’s case, he raised more than $12.5 million in the final months of 2025 following the “illegal orders” video controversy, according to campaign finance filings.\n\nSlotkin, like Kelly, has been mentioned among Democrats who could emerge as presidential contenders in 2028.\n\nShe previously represented one of the nation’s most competitive House districts before winning a Senate seat in Michigan in 2024, even as Trump carried the state.\n\nSlotkin delivered the Democratic response to Trump’s address to Congress last year and has since urged her party to confront him more aggressively, saying Democrats had lost their “alpha energy” and calling on them to “go nuclear” against Trump’s redistricting push.\n\n“If I’m encouraging other people to take risk, how can I not then accept risk myself?\" Slotkin said. “I think you’ve got to show people that we’re not going to lay down and take it.”",

    "fullText": "Feb 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. military on Tuesday shot down an Iranian drone that \"aggressively\" approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, ​the U.S. military said, in an incident first reported by Reuters.\n\nThe incident came as diplomats sought ‌to arrange nuclear talks between Iran and the United States, and U.S. President Donald Trump warned that with U.S. warships heading ‌toward Iran, \"bad things\" would probably happen if a deal could not be reached.\n\nOil futures prices rose more than $1 per barrel after news the drone was shot down.\n\nThe Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier \"with unclear intent\" and was shot down by an F-35 U.S. fighter jet, the U.S. military said.\n\n\"An F-35C fighter jet from ⁠Abraham Lincoln shot down the Iranian ‌drone in self-defense and to protect the aircraft carrier and personnel on board,\" said Navy Captain Tim Hawkins, a spokesperson at the U.S. military's Central Command.\n\nIran's U.N. ‍mission declined to comment.\n\nIran's Tasnim news agency said connection had been lost with a drone in international waters, but the reason was unknown.\n\nNo American service members were harmed during the incident and no U.S. equipment was damaged, he added.\n\nThe Lincoln ​carrier strike group is the most visible part of a U.S. military buildup in the Middle East ‌following a violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month, the deadliest domestic unrest in Iran since its 1979 revolution.\n\nTrump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene during the crackdown, has since demanded Tehran make nuclear concessions and sent a flotilla to its coast. He said last week Iran was \"seriously talking,\" while Tehran's top security official, Ali Larijani, said arrangements for negotiations were under way.\n\nIRANIAN BOATS HARASS U.S.-FLAGGED TANKER\n\nIn ⁠a separate incident on Tuesday in the Strait of ​Hormuz, just hours after the drone shootdown, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard ​Corps forces harassed a U.S.-flagged, U.S.-crewed merchant vessel, according to the U.S. military.\n\n\"Two IRGC boats and an Iranian Mohajer drone approached M/V Stena Imperative at high speeds and ‍threatened to board and seize ⁠the tanker,\" Hawkins said.\n\nMaritime risk management group Vanguard said the Iranian boats ordered the tanker to stop its engine and prepare to be boarded. Instead, the tanker sped up and continued its ⁠voyage.\n\nHawkins said a U.S. Navy warship, the McFaul, was operating in the area and escorted the Stena Imperative.\n\n\"The situation de-escalated as ‌a result, and the U.S.-flagged tanker is proceeding safely,\" Hawkins added.",

    "fullText": "Frozen weapons are among the many challenges NATO soldiers would face in an Arctic conflict.\n\nSoldiers have to be careful not to let the harsh elements cause their guns to malfunction.\n\nBut they also can't let the guns get too warm, as that creates new problems.\n\nSODANKYLÄ, Finland — Among the many challenges NATO soldiers face in the harsh Arctic environment, the possibility of frozen weapons is one that risks leaving them most vulnerable.\n\nIt's anything but easy to keep guns, drones, and other equipment in the right conditions far above the Arctic Circle, where temperatures routinely drop below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, and the heavy snow brings unwanted moisture that can cause jamming and other problems.\n\nNATO military personnel training in northern Finland told Business Insider during a visit to the region in late January that they can't afford to let their guns get too warm if they want them to work in this climate.\n\nThe biggest problem with weapons in these conditions is temperature variation, said Maj. Mikael Aikio, the Arctic section leader of the Finnish Army's Jaeger Brigade, which is leading a winter warfare training and cold-weather survival course for roughly 20 NATO soldiers.\n\nThe monthlong course, hosted in Finland's northern Lapland region, teaches NATO soldiers how to live, move, and fight in the harsh Arctic environment.\n\nThis type of training has become a growing priority for NATO as officials call for greater Arctic defense amid increasing Russian and Chinese activity in the High North. Western forces could find themselves fighting on frozen battlefields as the alliance and its adversaries compete for influence in this strategic region.\n\nLapland, like other northern regions in NATO's seven Arctic states, is a tough place to operate in winter. The biting cold, limited sunlight, and deep snowfall force troops to move slowly and with caution. And limited support infrastructure makes sustainment even more difficult up north.\n\nIn the Arctic, survival is only the first challenge. Troops must also keep their weapons functioning; even minor equipment failures can hand the enemy an edge.\n\nCanadian Cpt. Vincent Lemelin, one of the participants in the Arctic warfare training course, said all technology struggles in this part of the world, especially anything that requires charging, such as drones.\n\nAnything that gets covered in snow eventually becomes damp or wet, Lemelin said, so soldiers try to keep their guns cold at all times to avoid having ice or snow melt and introduce any moisture that might freeze and prevent it from working properly.\n\nFinnish Lt. Laura Lähdekorpi, another course participant, said she carries a brush with her at all times to clear snow from her gun, especially from sensitive areas like the optics, which are more vulnerable to buildup. Soldiers are trained to ensure their weapons are dry to prevent anything from freezing up.\n\nLähdekorpi said firing a cold gun is a challenge. Her outer gloves are too bulky, so she strips them off and uses a thin liner to pull the trigger, but that leaves her hands exposed to the weapon's metal frame, which holds the cold.\n\n\"I think my hands are the worst enemy for me,\" she said. \"I have to keep them warm.\"\n\nProper weapon care doesn't end when training stops. Soldiers are taught to keep their guns at a steady ambient temperature. Bringing them into a warm tent, for instance, can cause condensation that later refreezes.\n\nSoldiers can't leave the guns outside their tents, as they might be stolen in real-world conditions. Instead, they bring them inside but place the weapons on the ground or in a space that is almost as cold as it is outside.\n\nProper firearm temperature management is not the only equipment struggle in the harsh Arctic. Drones are also relatively limited in their capabilities, especially in extreme cold, when temperatures drop below -14 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nDuring a combat exercise in the middle of the Arctic warfare course, soldiers practiced using drones to collect targeting data and call in artillery strikes against a simulated enemy force made up of Finnish conscripts.\n\nUsing small drones for reconnaissance, targeting, and fire support missions is standard practice in the Russian war against Ukraine, and they are expected to continue to be a key part of the kill chain in future conflicts, despite their limitations.\n\nAikio, a Jaeger Brigade major, said drones need special handling in Arctic conditions. Leaving them exposed on snowmobiles before launch risks damage from the elements, and once airborne, icing on small propellers and limited visibility can quickly degrade performance.\n\nLearning to keep weapons and other gear operational in this environment is one of many skills NATO soldiers are being taught to master in Finland, roughly a third of which lies above the Arctic Circle. The country also knows cold-weather combat, making it well-suited to teach the rest of the alliance winter warfare.\n\nLemelin, the Canadian captain, described the course as a \"humbling experience;\" it's critical exposure for the NATO alliance as Western militaries grapple with a rapidly changing Arctic environment and an expanding adversarial footprint.",

    "description": "The anti-corruption campaign has left open positions and a lack of senior officials with the experience to fill them.",
    "fullText": "China's drive to modernize its military to rival the US armed forces is running parallel with an aggressive purge of its senior leaders.\n\nThe People's Liberation Army has been repeatedly shaken by a massive anti-corruption campaign led by Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Now, the military leadership is under renewed scrutiny after one of China's most senior generals was placed under investigation.\n\nThe latest disruptions within the PLA, the world's largest military and one of its most powerful, raise questions about who is leading the force and how the shake-ups are affecting the military as an organization and impacting readiness.\n\nThis past weekend, China's defense ministry announced investigations into Gen. Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Liu Zhenli, the chief of staff of the commission's joint staff department. Zhang was widely believed to be one of Xi's trusted military advisors.\n\nAn editorial published in official PLA media said the two had \"seriously betrayed the trust and expectations\" of both the Communist Party and the CMC and \"fostered political and corruption problems that undermined the party's absolute leadership over the military and threatened the party's ruling foundation.\"\n\nAnalysts Business Insider spoke with said the accusations suggested more than just financial corruption, which has been the case for others. Rather, the language indicates Zhang and Liu challenged Xi's authority, whether through disagreements on modernization goals, failures to meet expectations, or power and influence struggles within the ranks. The reasons may never be known, as China's \"black box\" opacity increasingly blurs realities inside its government.\n\nA report from the Wall Street Journal raised the possibility Zhang leaked nuclear weapons data to the US. Business Inside is unable to independently verify the information.\n\nOf the seven officials appointed to the Central Military Commission in 2022, only two — Xi himself and Zhang Shengmin, the commission's anti-graft officer — remain in power. The rest are either under investigation or have been expelled.\n\nTwo defense ministers have been ousted, and last October, nine top PLA commanders were purged. The exact number of senior military leaders affected is unknown, but there are indications the purge has deeply impacted the senior officer corps.\n\nZhang is the highest-ranking official affected by Xi's crackdown on the military. And across the lower ranks of the PLA, dozens of other officers have been removed from their positions.\n\n\"This is kind of the ultimate crescendo of this anti-corruption campaign in the military,\" Jonathan Czin, an expert at the Brookings Institute who previously served as a top China analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency and director for China at the United States National Security Council, told Business Insider.\n\n\"It sends a very clear sign throughout the system that nobody is safe regardless of what kind of relationship you had or have with Xi Jinping,\" he said.\n\nMore investigations may follow those of Zhang and Liu. Officials with ties to the two men could come under suspicion as well, analysts said. Other senior people have been notably absent from important meetings in recent months, suggesting more shakeups.\n\nThat leaves Xi with a difficult next step: deciding who can credibly fill the vacancies.\n\nBecause so many senior officers have been removed or face investigations, \"the pool of candidates for refilling top positions has been winnowed,\" Brian Hart, the deputy director and fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies' China Power Project, told Business Insider. \"Xi could continue to use the existing command structure of the CMC and fill it with new people loyal to him,\" he added. \"It is also possible Xi could try to start over with a bit of a blank slate by more fundamentally remaking the PLA's leadership structure.\"\n\nFewer experienced commanders could slow coordination across China's military — a serious challenge for complex operations like a blockade or invasion of Taiwan.\n\nSome PLA watchers argue Xi appears willing to accept those short-term costs if the result is a force that is more politically loyal and disciplined over time. The PLA Daily editorial framed the campaign as a net positive, arguing that \"the more the People's Army fights corruption, the stronger, purer, and more combat-capable it becomes.\"\n\nA senior Pentagon official previously speculated that the extensive corruption in China's military was hindering its modernization.\n\nAmid disruptions in the force, China may seek to send a signal that shake-ups aren't affecting military readiness.\n\n\"You could actually see an uptick in the number of major exercises around Taiwan, but internally it could mask significant upheaval and disarray within the PLA,\" Lyle Morris, a senior fellow for foreign policy and national security at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis, told Business Insider.\n\nChina staged large joint exercises around Taiwan following earlier purge waves. Such actions could project readiness despite leadership turmoil.\n\nThe internal upheaval is likely having an effect, though, China watchers said. \"It is hard to deny that this creates challenges for the PLA in the short term,\" Hart said. \"Any leader deciding on using force would want senior leaders and commanders in place who are loyal, experienced, and effective in their roles. The immense turnover within the PLA's highest ranks complicates that.\"",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Marco Rubio gave a full-throated defense Wednesday of President Donald Trump's military operation to oust and arrest then-Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, while also using his wide-ranging congressional testimony to touch on Greenland, NATO, Iran and China.\n\nAs Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee offered starkly different readings of the administration's foreign policy, Rubio addressed Trump's intentions and his often bellicose rhetoric that have alarmed U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere.\n\nIn the first public hearing since the Jan. 3 intervention to depose Maduro, Rubio said Trump had acted to take out a major U.S. national security threat in the Western Hemisphere. Trump's top diplomat said America was safer and more secure as a result and that the Republican administration would work with interim authorities to stabilize the South American country.\n\n“We’re not going to have this thing turn around overnight, but I think we’re making good and decent progress,” Rubio said. “We are certainly better off today in Venezuela than we were four weeks ago and I think and hope and expect that we’ll be better off in three months and six months and nine months than we would have been had Maduro still been there.\"\n\nThe former Florida senator said that Venezuela's current leaders are cooperating and would soon begin to see benefits. But he backed away from remarks prepared for the hearing that Washington would not hesitate to take further military action should those leaders not fully accept Trump's demands.\n\n“I can tell you right now with full certainty, we are not postured to nor do we intend or expect to have to take any military action in Venezuela at any time,\" Rubio said. “I think it would require the emergence of an imminent threat of the kind that we do not anticipate at this time.”\n\nHe said Venezuela soon will be allowed to sell oil that is now subject to U.S. sanctions. The revenue would be set aside to pay for basic government services such as policing and health care. Oil sale money will be deposited in a U.S. Treasury-controlled account and released after the U.S. approves monthly budgets to be submitted by Venezuela, he said.\n\nPushback against skepticism from Democrats\n\nRepublican senators, with few exceptions, praised the Venezuelan operation. Among Democrats, there was deep skepticism.\n\nThey questioned Trump's policies in Venezuela and their potential for encouraging moves by China against Taiwan and Russia even more so in Ukraine, as well as his threats to take Greenland from NATO ally Denmark and his insults about the alliance's contributions to U.S. security.\n\nHe said the uproar over Greenland within NATO is calming and that talks are underway about how to deal with Trump's demands. The Republican president insists the U.S. needs Greenland to counter threats from Russia and China, but he recently backed away from a pledge to impose tariffs on several European countries that sent troops to the semiautonomous Danish territory in a show of solidarity.\n\n“I think we’re going to get something positive done,\" Rubio said.\n\nRubio dismissed criticism that Trump was undermining the alliance, while repeating the long-running American complaint that member nations need to boost their defense budgets.\n\n“NATO needs to be reimagined.” Rubio said. “I just think this president complains about it louder than other presidents.\"\n\nHe said China's stated goal to reunify Taiwan with the mainland would not be affected by any other world event, including the Maduro operation.\n\n“The situation on Taiwan is a legacy project\" that Chinese President Xi Jinping has made \"very clear that that’s what he intends to do and that’s going to be irrespective anything that happens in the world,” Rubio said.\n\nAs Trump once more threatens Iran with military action, Rubio said there was no current plan to attack. Asked about the potential for a change of government in Tehran, Rubio said that would require “a lot of careful thinking” because it would be “far more complex” than ousting Maduro.\n\nMore details about the raid in Caracas\n\nThe committee chairman, Idaho Sen. Jim Risch, praised Trump’s decisions to remove Maduro, continue deadly military strikes on boats suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean and seize sanctioned tankers.\n\nRisch also offered new details on the operation in the Venezuelan capital, saying it involved “only about 200 troops” and a “firefight that lasted less than 27 minutes.”\n\n“This military action was incredibly brief, targeted and successful,” Risch said, adding that the U.S. and other nations may have to assist Venezuela when it seeks to restore democratic elections. ”Venezuela may require U.S. and international oversight to ensure these elections are indeed free and fair,” he said.\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the committee's top Democrat, questioned whether that operation was worth it, considering most of Maduro's top aides and lieutenants still run the Venezuela and the economic situation there remains bleak.\n\n\"We’ve traded one dictator for another, so it’s no wonder that so many of my constituents are asking, why is the president spending so much time focused on Venezuela instead of the cost of living and their kitchen table economic concerns?\" she asked. “From Venezuela to Europe, the United States is spending more, risking more and achieving less.”\n\nCongress hasn't curtailed Trump on Venezuela\n\nCongressional Democrats have condemned Trump’s moves as exceeding the authority of the executive branch, while most Republicans have supported them as a legitimate exercise of presidential power.\n\nThe GOP-led House narrowly defeated a war powers act resolution that would have directed Trump to remove U.S. troops from Venezuela. As Rubio argued, the administration says there are no U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela despite a large military buildup in the region.\n\nDemocrats contended the resolution was necessary after the U.S. raid to capture Maduro and because Trump has stated plans to control the country’s oil industry for years to come.\n\nFamilies of two Trinidadian nationals killed in an administration boat strike filed what is thought to be the first wrongful-death case arising from that campaign. Three dozen strikes on boats in the region have killed at least 126 people since September.\n\nUS acts to normalize ties while issuing warnings\n\nWhile keeping pressure on those the U.S. calls “narcotraffickers” without providing evidence, officials also are working to normalize ties with Venezuela's acting president, Delcy Rodríguez.\n\nThe administration has said its demands for Rodriguez include opening Venezuela’s energy sector to U.S. companies, providing preferential access to production, using oil revenue to purchase American goods, and ending subsidized oil exports to Cuba.\n\nRodríguez, who was Maduro's vice president, said Tuesday that her government and the U.S. “have established respectful and courteous channels of communication.” And so far, she has appeared to acquiesce to Trump’s demands and to release prisoners jailed by the government under Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez.\n\nIn a key step to the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the State Department notified Congress this week that it intends to begin sending additional diplomatic and support personnel to Caracas to prepare for the possible reopening of the U.S. Embassy, which shuttered in 2019. Fully normalizing ties, however, would require the U.S. to revoke its decision recognizing the Venezuelan parliament elected in 2015 as the country’s legitimate government.\n\nLater Wednesday, Rubio was to meet Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado at the State Department.",

    "description": "In a major shift for Ukraine's military, Serhii \"Flash\" Beskrestnov and Serhii Sternenko are now officially advising Kyiv on defense tech and drones.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's new defense minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, has appointed two prominent Telegram bloggers and activists to his \"team of new leaders,\" saying they will advise him on defense technology and drone warfare.\n\nThe move is a major recognition for the pair — Serhii \"Flash\" Beskrestnov and Serhii Sternenko — who are among the most influential voices among the volunteers filling vital gaps in logistics and drone expertise for Ukraine's battered military.\n\nBeskrestnov, widely cited among Ukrainians as an expert on drones, runs a Telegram channel with some 156,000 followers, where he publicly analyzes Russian and Ukrainian battle drones and how they've performed.\n\nFedorov named him an advisor in defense technology on Sunday, saying Beskrestnov would focus on helping Ukraine build counter-systems for Russian strike and reconnaissance drones.\n\nIn his statement, Fedorov said that Beskrestnov would also support Ukraine's military in analyzing Russian tech, studying \"logistics, study of enemy solutions, and leveraging this experience to our advantage.\"\n\nSternenko, a political activist who now runs an organization that raises funds for military drones, was appointed as Fedorov's advisor on Thursday.\n\n\"From now on, Serhii will act as my advisor on enhancing the use of UAVs at the frontline. His experience will help us implement our shared vision of improving the effectiveness of units operating unmanned systems,\" Fedorov said.\n\nThe Sternenko Foundation serves as a hub for drone procurement, raising money to buy specialized first-person-view drones for military units that demonstrate they're combat-effective.\n\nAs of Monday, it says it has delivered over 256,000 drones on demand to Ukrainian units.\n\nFedorov, Ukraine's youngest-ever defense minister at 35, previously was the country's minister for digital transformation. Since being confirmed to his new role earlier this month, he's pledged to revitalize Ukraine's military, promising to reform its training programs, internal culture, and organizational doctrine.\n\nAppointing Sternenko and Beskrestnov as advisors is a significant change in how Kyiv treats its grassroots movements. These groups work closely with Ukrainian forces, but top authorities have generally been slow to officially recognize or integrate them.\n\nSeveral frontline units previously told Business Insider that they sometimes rely on the Sternenko Foundation, for example, for drones that can effectively cope with Russian electronic warfare. While the Ukrainian military provides its fighters with drones in bulk, these sometimes need further tweaks as the battlefield evolves rapidly.\n\nVolunteer foundations often step in and have become known for their speed, leveraging connections with drone manufacturers and informal logistics networks to deliver priority supplies, vehicles, and modified drones within hours or days.\n\nFedorov said that Sternenko would particularly assist in establishing basic support for drone units, adding that 50 of Ukraine's 400 units account for 70% of its battlefield engagements.\n\n\"The objective is to enable the other 350 units to grow quickly and significantly increase the scale of destroying Russian forces,\" Fedorov said.\n\nBeskrestnov, meanwhile, regularly publicizes news about Russia's Shahed-type drones. He often posts footage from found wreckage to show how the Kremlin has been modifying or upgrading the loitering munitions.\n\nFedorov's team credited the drone analyst for being the \"first to report on the use by Russians of FPV drones equipped with machine vision, as well as the use of jet-powered Shahed drones.\"\n\nThe new defense minister's attempt to reshape Ukraine's military comes as it grapples with a slew of challenges, including heightened fighting intensity on the front lines in recent months and a withdrawal of most US miliary support.\n\nIn his opening speech to Ukraine's parliament, Fedorov said the country was facing a high rate of desertion and draft dodging, and that the military's budget had shrunk since last year.",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Two Iranian-backed militias in the Mideast are signaling their willingness to launch new attacks, likely trying to back Iran, as officials acknowledged the arrival of a U.S. aircraft carrier to the region Monday. President Donald Trump ordered the carriers to move to the Middle East as he threatened military action over its crackdown on nationwide protests.\n\nYemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels on Monday hinted they were ready to resume attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. That came just after Iraq's Kataib Hezbollah paramilitary group, long supported by Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, issued a direct threat late Sunday toward any attack targeting Iran, warning a “total war” in the region would be a result.\n\nThe statements came as the entire region is mired in a tense waiting game to see if Trump will strike. Both the Houthis and Kataib Hezbollah sat out from Israel's 12-day war on Iran in June that saw the United States bomb Iranian nuclear sites. The hesitancy to get involved shows the disarray still affecting Iran's self-described “Axis of Resistance” after facing attacks from Israel during its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe threats came as the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and other guided missile destroyers in its strike group arrived in the region to “promote regional security and stability,” U.S. Central Command said Monday on social media.\n\nTrump has said the ships are being moved “just in case” he decides to take action against Iran. He has already laid out two red lines for attack — the killing of peaceful protesters and Tehran conducting mass executions of those it has arrested in a massive crackdown over the demonstrations.\n\nA senior Iranian military official who spoke anonymously on Iran's State TV dismissed the American threat as “an exaggeration” and noted that Iran had increased its military presence in response. The official added that the Lincoln's presence was not a deterrent but an accessible target.\n\nThreats from Iraq, Yemen, while Hezbollah stays mum\n\nIran projected its power across the Mideast through the “Axis of Resistance,” a network of proxy militant groups in Gaza, Lebanon, Yemen, Syria, and Iraq, and other places. It was also seen as a defensive buffer, intended to keep conflict away from Iranian borders. But it has collapsed after Israel targeted Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon and others during the Gaza war. Meanwhile, rebels in 2024 overthrew Syria’s Bashar Assad after a yearslong, bloody war in which Iran backed his rule.\n\nThe Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, one of Iran's staunchest allies, refused to say how it planned to react in the case of a possible attack.\n\n“During the past two months, several parties have asked me a clear and frank question: If Israel and America go to war against Iran, will Hezbollah intervene or not?” Hezbollah leader Sheikh Naim Kassem said via a video address to thousands of supporters gathered in Beirut's southern suburbs for a rally backing Iran.\n\nHe said the group is preparing for “possible aggression and is determined to defend” against it. But as to how it would act, he said, “these details will be determined by the battle and we will determine them according to the interests that are present.”\n\nIraqi and Yemenite militant groups were much more forthright in their threats, which were interpreted as support for Iran. A short video by the Houthis included images of a ship on fire, with the caption: “Soon.” It later aired footage Monday from its January 2024 attack in the Gulf of Aden on the Marshall Islands-flagged tanker Marlin Luanda, one of over 100 ships attacked as part of a campaign the Houthis said pressured Israel over its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe Houthis halted their fire after a ceasefire in Gaza, though they've repeatedly warned they could resume fire if needed.\n\nMeanwhile, Ahmad “Abu Hussein” al-Hamidawi of Kataib Hezbollah issued his own threat in a statement.\n\n“We affirm to the enemies that the war on the (Islamic) Republic will not be a picnic; rather, you will taste the bitterest forms of death, and nothing will remain of you in our region,” he said.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates announced on Monday that it would not allow its airspace, territory or territorial waters to be used for military action against Iran. The UAE said it would stress dialogue and diplomatic resolutions.\n\nIran warns America not to attack\n\nIranian Defense Ministry spokesperson Gen. Reza Talaei-Nik renewed warnings Monday to both Israel and the U.S., saying any attack would “be met with a response that is more painful and more decisive than in the past.” Iranian state television quoted Talaei-Nik as saying that threats required Iran “to maintain full and comprehensive preparedness.”\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei separately told journalists: “Regional countries fully know that any security breach in the region will not affect Iran only. The lack of security is contagious.”\n\nIran over the weekend unveiled a new banner in Tehran's Enghelab Square threatening the Lincoln, showing an aircraft carrier strewn with bodies and streaked with blood with the warning: “If you sow the wind, you will reap the whirlwind.” However, Iran is still reeling from the 12-day war in June in which its air defense systems were broadly destroyed, top military leaders killed, and its nuclear enrichment sites bombed by the U.S.\n\nAs a sign of concern over its airspace, Iran issued a notice to pilots Sunday that banned small private aircraft from flying in the country, with carve-outs for the oil industry and emergency medical flights.\n\nMany Western airlines have started to avoid Iranian airspace entirely due to the tensions, though Gulf Arab carriers flying to Moscow still rely on the route. Iranian air defense troops in 2020 shot down a Ukrainian commercial airliner, killing 176 people on board.\n\nDeath toll rises from protest crackdown\n\nThe protests in Iran began on Dec. 28, sparked by the fall of the Iranian currency, the rial, and quickly spread across the country. They were met by a violent crackdown by Iran’s theocracy, the scale of which is only starting to become clear as the country has faced more than two-week internet blackout — the most comprehensive in its history.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency on Monday put the death toll at 5,973, with the number expected to increase. It says more than 41,813 people have been arrested.\n\nThe group’s figures have been accurate in previous unrest and rely on a network of activists in Iran to verify deaths. That death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest there in decades, and recalls the chaos surrounding Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify the toll.\n\nIran’s government has put the death toll at a far lower 3,117, saying 2,427 were civilians and security forces, and labeled the rest “terrorists.” In the past, Iran’s theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from unrest.",

    "fullText": "TAIPEI, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Taiwan is monitoring what it called \"abnormal\" changes to China's military leadership after its most senior general was put under investigation, and will not lower its ​guard as the threat level remains high, the defence minister said on Monday.\n\nChina announced on ‌Saturday that Zhang Youxia, second-in-command under President Xi Jinping as vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, and another senior officer, Liu ‌Zhenli, were under investigation for suspected serious violations of discipline and law.\n\n\"We will continue to closely monitor abnormal changes among the top levels of China's party, government, and military leadership.

Taiwan's government says only the island's people can decide their ⁠future.\n\nSpeaking later in the day to lawmakers, Koo said it ​was clear that the Chinese threat was worsening, pointing to ​the war games, daily military activities and ongoing rise in China's defence spending, and Taiwan cannot let down its guard.\n\n\"We won't let the downfall of any one person ‍make us lower our guard ⁠or slacken the level of war preparedness we should maintain,\" he added.\n\nTaiwan will exchange intelligence with its partners on what changes may be taking places in China's military command structure, Koo ⁠said.\n\n\"Regarding the threat to us, we need to focus on early-warning indicators and signs. This has to be continuous not ‌only on the military side but also on the non-military side.\"",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iranian authorities unveiled a new mural on a giant billboard in a central Tehran square on Sunday with a direct warning to the United States to not attempt a military strike on the country, as U.S. warships head to the region.\n\nThe image shows a bird's-eye view of an aircraft carrier with damaged and exploding fighter planes on its flight deck. The deck is strewn with bodies and streaked with blood that trails into the water behind the ship to form a pattern reminiscent of the stripes of the American flag. A slogan is emblazoned across one corner: “If you sow the wind, you will reap the whirlwind.”\n\nThe unveiling of the mural in Enghelab Square comes as the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and accompanying warships move toward the region. U.S. President Donald Trump has said the ships are being moved “just in case” he decides to take action.\n\n“We have a massive fleet heading in that direction and maybe we won’t have to use it,” Trump said Thursday.\n\nEnghelab Square is used for gatherings called by the state and authorities change its mural based on national occasions. On Saturday, the commander of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard warned that his force is “more ready than ever, finger on the trigger.”\n\nTension between the U.S. and Iran has spiked in the wake of a brutal crackdown on nationwide protests that saw thousands of people killed and tens of thousands arrested. Trump had threatened military action if Iran continued to kill peaceful protesters or carried out mass executions of those detained.\n\nThere have been no further protests for days and Trump claimed recently that Tehran had halted the planned execution of about 800 arrested protesters — a claim Iran’s top prosecutor called “completely false.”\n\nBut Trump has indicated he is keeping his options open, saying on Thursday that any military action would make last June’s U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites “look like peanuts.”\n\nU.S. Central Command said on social media that its Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle now has a presence in the Middle East, noting the fighter jet “enhances combat readiness and promotes regional security and stability.”\n\nSimilarly, the U.K. Ministry of Defense said Thursday that it deployed its Typhoon fighter jets to Qatar “in a defensive capacity.”\n\nThe protests in Iran began on Dec. 28, sparked by the fall of the Iranian currency, the rial, and quickly spread across the country. They were met by a violent crackdown by Iran’s theocracy, which does not tolerate dissent.\n\nThe death toll reported by activists has continued to rise since the end of the demonstrations, as information trickles out despite a more than two-week internet blackout — the most comprehensive in Iran’s history.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency on Sunday put the death toll at 5,848, with the number expected to increase. It says more than 41,280 people have been arrested.\n\nThe group’s figures have been accurate in previous unrest and rely on a network of activists in Iran to verify deaths. That death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest there in decades, and recalls the chaos surrounding Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify the toll.\n\nIran’s government has put the death toll at a far lower 3,117, saying 2,427 were civilians and security forces, and labeled the rest “terrorists.” In the past, Iran’s theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from unrest.",

    "description": "A Pentagon watchdog found confusing counter-drone policies are leaving some US military bases vulnerable to drone incursions.",
    "fullText": "A Pentagon watchdog report is warning that gaps in Pentagon policy are leaving some US military bases vulnerable to drone threats.\n\nThe report, released Tuesday by the Pentagon's Inspector General, said that the military lacks consistent guidance for defending sensitive \"covered assets\" — US-based sites legally authorized to use certain counter-drone defenses — against offensive uncrewed aircraft, a problem exacerbated by jumbled, contradictory policies across the services.\n\nWhile the Defense Department has issued multiple counter-UAS policies — rules governing how the military can detect, disrupt, or disable uncrewed aerial systems — those directives are not standardized, leaving some base leaders unaware that their installations qualify as \"covered assets.\" The term refers to locations within the US that deal with sensitive missions like nuclear deterrence, missile defense, presidential protection, air defense, and \"high yield\" explosives.\n\nThat lack of awareness derived from confusing policy risks leaving bases exposed to uncrewed threats, a growing concern.\n\nThe Inspector General report examines 10 military installations where drone incursions have occurred. The watchdog assessment found multiple examples of \"covered assets\" left uncovered due to unclear policies.\n\nThe Air Force base in Arizona where most F-35 pilots are trained, for instance, is not authorized to defend against UAS incursions because pilot training does not qualify as a \"covered\" activity under Pentagon policy, despite the Air Force describing the F-35 as \"an indispensable tool in future homeland defense.\"\n\nAnother Air Force facility in California that manufactures aircraft repair parts, conducts aircraft maintenance, and makes the Global Hawk, an ultra-advanced large surveillance drone that costs more than the F-35A, has also been left vulnerable, and the site experienced a series of drone incursions in 2024, the report said.\n\n\"Air Force officials told us that the government-owned, contractor-operated facility was denied coverage during the active incursions,\" in 2024, the IG report says.\n\nThe problem extends beyond determining whether a site is covered. The process for obtaining counter-drone systems — and securing rapid legal approval to use them when needed — is complex and slow, reflecting legal restrictions on using electronic jamming or force inside the US, the report found.\n\nConcerns about drone threats to military installations have grown in recent years as small, inexpensive commercial drones have become dramatically more popular and easy to use. Such systems lower the barrier to entry on surveillance and precision strike from the state level to non-state actors and can create challenges for security personnel who are often constrained in their response options, or improperly trained and equipped to react.\n\nIn 2024, multiple bases within the US and abroad experienced strings of drone incursions, events that can involve one or more unmanned aircraft entering restricted airspace or operating close enough to installations to trigger alarms, even when the drones are not linked to foreign adversaries.\n\n\"In recent years, adversary unmanned systems have evolved rapidly,\" a Department of Defense counter-drone strategy released in the final months of the Biden administration said. \"These cheap systems are increasingly changing the battlefield, threatening US installations, and wounding or killing our troops.\"\n\nEfforts to address the drone problem have been in the works for years, though a Center for New American Security report released last September said the military's efforts were \"hindered by insufficient scale and urgency.\"\n\nSome units have received counter-drone tools such as portable \"flyaway kits\" — deployable systems meant to be moved quickly between sites — and the \"Dronebuster,\" a handheld electronic-warfare device that emits a signal to disrupt or disable an offending drone. The Army secretary recently questioned the latter system's effectiveness, underscoring broader uncertainty about how best to defend US bases from the growing drone threat.\n\nThe US military is trying to catch up with the threat, to develop defenses as fast or faster than drone technology is currently developing, driven in large part by the drone-dominant Ukraine war. As he announced the creation of Joint Interagency Task Force 401 last August, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said \"there's no doubt that the threats we face today from hostile drones grow by the day.\"\n\n\"The challenge for airspace management is how to deter or defeat such incursions without endangering the surrounding civilian communities or legitimate air traffic. That rules out everything kinetic,\" Mark Cancian, a defense expert and retired US Marine Corps colonel, told Business Insider in late 2024 during a series of incursions.\n\n\"This has become a huge problem for both military and civilian airfields and will get worse and drone usage proliferates further,\" he said.",

    "description": "China's most senior general is under investigation, China's defence ministry said on Saturday, in the highest-profile purge to date of senior military leadership just as Beijing",
    "fullText": "Jan 24 (Reuters) - China's most senior general is under investigation, China's defence ministry said on Saturday, in the highest-profile purge to date of senior military leadership just as Beijing modernises its forces and tries to further project its might.\n\nZhang Youxia serves as second-in-command under President Xi Jinping as vice-chairman of the Central ​Military Commission - the supreme command body - and has long been seen as Xi's closest military ally.\n\nThe ministry said Zhang and Liu Zhenli, chief of staff of the ‌CMC's Joint Staff Department, were under investigation for suspected serious violations of discipline and law.\n\nZhang is also a member of the elite Politburo of the ruling Communist Party and is one of just a few leading officers with ‌combat experience.\n\nSWEEPING CRACKDOWN TARGETS MILITARY\n\nThe military was one of the main targets of a broad corruption crackdown ordered by Xi in 2012. That drive reached the upper echelons of the People's Liberation Army in 2023 when the elite Rocket Force was targeted.\n\nZhang's removal is the second of a sitting general on the Central Military Commission since the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. He has not been seen in public since November 20, when he held talks with Russia's defence minister in Moscow.\n\nForeign diplomats and security analysts are watching developments closely, given Zhang's closeness to Xi and the importance of the commission's work ⁠in terms of command as well as the PLA's ongoing ‌military modernisation and posture.\n\nWhile China has not fought a war in decades, it is taking an increasingly muscular line in the disputed East China Sea and South China Sea, as well as over the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which is claimed by China. Beijing staged the ‍largest military exercises to date around Taiwan late last year.\n\nSingapore-based China security scholar James Char said the military's daily operations could carry on as normal despite the purges but the targeting of Zhang showed Xi was reacting to criticism that the crackdown had been too selective.\n\n\"Xi has been tapping on second-line PLA officers to fill those roles vacated by their predecessors – on an interim basis in most cases,\" said Char, ​a scholar at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.\n\n\"China’s military modernizers will continue to push for the two goals Xi has set for the PLA – namely, 2035 to basically complete ‌its modernisation and 2049 to become a world-class armed forces.\"\n\nZhang is the second vice chair of the CMC to fall from grace in recent months. Former CMC vice chair He Weidong was expelled from the party and PLA in October last year for corruption. He was replaced by Zhang Shengmin.\n\nEight top generals were expelled from the Communist Party on graft charges in October 2025, including He Weidong.\n\nTwo former defence ministers were also purged from the ruling party in recent years for corruption. The crackdown is slowing procurement of advanced weaponry and hitting the revenues of some of China's biggest defence firms.\n\nBoth Xi and Zhang are from the northwestern province of Shaanxi and are the children of former senior officials who fought together ⁠in the 1940s civil war.\n\nBorn in Beijing, Zhang joined the army in 1968, rising through the ranks ​and joining the military commission in late 2012 as the PLA's modernisation drive gathered pace.\n\nA Pentagon profile of Zhang ​in late 2023 noted that Zhang had been expected to retire in 2022, aged 72, given usual military practice.\n\n\"However, Zhang's retention on the CMC for a third term probably reflects Xi's desire to keep a close and experienced ally as his top military adviser,\" the profile said, contained within the ‍Pentagon's annual report on China's military that year.\n\nHe ⁠fought Vietnam in a brief but bloody border war in 1979 that China launched in punishment for Vietnam invading Cambodia the previous year and ousting the Beijing-backed Khmer Rouge.\n\nZhang was 26 when he was sent to the front lines to fight the Vietnamese and was quickly promoted, according to state media. He also fought in another border ⁠clash with Vietnam in 1984 as the conflict rumbled on.\n\n\"During the battle, whether attacking or defending, Zhang Youxia performed excellently,\" the official China Youth Daily wrote in a 2017 piece entitled, \"These Chinese generals have killed the enemy ‌on the battlefield\".\n\nSome China scholars have noted that Zhang emerged from the conflict an avowed moderniser in terms of military tactics, weapons and the need for ‌a better trained force.",

    "description": "DoD is reportedly considering cutting ties with the Boy Scouts, even as data from military schools shows Scouting is common among future officers.",
    "fullText": "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is reportedly considering severing ties with Scouting America, which could mean a consequential break with an organization that has long been closely associated with military service and leadership development.\n\nPublic data from two prominent military schools, West Point and the Naval Academy, shows that Scouting is common among future officers — more than one in ten cadets and about 10% of midshipmen in recent years have a Scouting background.\n\nA memo obtained by NPR in November highlighted Hegseth's desire to halt military support for the Scouts' National Jamboree and group activities on military bases.\n\nThe Pentagon declined to provide a copy of the memo to Business Insider and did not comment on details surrounding any potential separation.\n\n\"The Department will not comment on leaked documents that we cannot authenticate and that may be pre-decisional,\" Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said in an email when asked whether the Pentagon still plans to move forward with severing ties.\n\nScouting America did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nThe Scouts' Jamboree has long been a highly visible point of contact between the military and American youth. In 2017, the event featured a significant military presence — simulated helicopter rescues, displays of tanks and aircraft, flyovers, drill team performances, a special operations challenge, and other opportunities for Scouts to interact directly with service members.\n\nWhether the 2026 Jamboree events will feature similar military involvement remains to be seen (the Jamboree is usually held once every four years.) The reported memo on the Pentagon's intended split with the Scouts decried the organization as \"woke.\"\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America began admitting girls in 2018, while the Girl Scouts remains a separate organization. The group had earlier opened its programs to transgender boys in 2017 and to gay boys in 2013.\n\nIn 2024, before Hegseth became the defense secretary, he remarked that Scouts had been \"cratering\" for some time during a Fox News show. He accused the political left of trying to \"destroy it or dilute it into something that stood for nothing.\"\n\nThis new uncertainty comes at a time of relative stability for military recruiting, after a yearslong crisis that peaked during the COVID-19 pandemic. Enlistment numbers have rebounded in large part because of a shaky job market and the Army and Navy's preparatory courses, which help otherwise unqualified applicants improve their fitness and test scores enough to qualify for boot camp.\n\nThose pre-boot camp programs have drawn scrutiny though. A government watchdog report last year found they allowed in too many low-scoring recruits, raising concerns about long-term readiness and standards.\n\nEven with recruiting off to a strong start in the new fiscal year, looming challenges remain. A declining national birthrate — expected to become more pronounced over the coming decade — means the military will face a smaller pool of eligible young people in the years ahead. That makes early exposure to service-oriented institutions especially important, said Kate Kuszminski, the director of studies at the Center for a New American Security and author of a recent report on recruiting.\n\nScouting, she told Business Insider, can give young people two things the military has long valued: moral grounding and early exposure to skills that translate to service.\n\n\"The scouting system provides quite a few tangible things well before youth are of recruiting age that could pay dividends in the long run,\" Kuszminski said.\n\nData from West Point highlights that overlap. About 14% of the Academy's graduating class of 2027 reported a background in Scouting, according to the publicly available data. More than half of those former Scouts had earned the Eagle Scout or Girl Scouts' Gold Award.\n\nThe data does not distinguish between male and female Scouts.\n\nThat pattern has held steady in recent years. For the graduating classes of 2022 through 2026, between 13% and 16% of students reported having a Scouting background. In the classes of 2025, 2026, and 2027, the number of former Scouts was nearly equal to the number of cadets who entered West Point from Junior ROTC programs.\n\nComparable data for the Naval Academy is harder to find, but a class profile for the class of 2028 lists roughly 10% of students as former Scouts.\n\nFor some veterans, those numbers are unsurprising. The Scouts have long had some overlap with military service, said David Chetlain, a Navy veteran and former Boy Scout. His own experience in Scouting reinforced a sense of service that he says is increasingly hard for students to find elsewhere.\n\n\"You want to teach young people that they're part of a community and that they should be involved in it,\" Chetlain said. Children learn a lot from team-building activities like school sports, he said, \"but you don't learn citizenship, you don't learn service, and you don't necessarily learn leadership in the same way.\"\n\n\"They're trying to prepare people for life, and those same attributes that make you successful in life will make you successful in the military,\" he added. \"That's why I think the relationship is important.\"\n\nThe reported rift with the Scouts comes as the Pentagon searches for new and innovative ways to sustain recruiting momentum with its new Recruitment Task Force. Few details about its scope or recommendations have been made public.",

You know, they’ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, and they did—they stayed a little back, little off the front lines. But we’ve been very good to Europe and to many other countries.”\n\nHis message sparked outrage in the U.K., which sent more than 150,000 troops to Afghanistan in the years following the U.S.-led invasion in 2001.\n\nThe British contingency, which, after the U.S., was the second largest of the campaign, lost 457 soldiers, while thousands more were injured.\n\n“They were absolutely on the front lines,” Lucy Aldridge, whose son William died in Afghanistan when he was 18, told The Mirror. “And to ignore that because, let’s face it, Trump isn’t particularly hot on history… He is so out of touch with the reality, and what it costs in human life. He has no compassion whatsoever for anyone who doesn’t serve him.”\n\nDiane Dernie, whose son Ben Parkinson suffered horrific injuries in Afghanistan in 2006, said Trump’s latest comments were “the ultimate insult.”\n\nStarmer’s official spokesperson pointed out that the response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks was the only time NATO has invoked Article 5, the alliance’s collective defense principle that treats an attack on one member as an attack on all, The Telegraph reported.\n\n“Their sacrifice and that of other Nato allies was made in the service of collective security and in response to an attack on our ally,” Starmer’s spokesperson said of the soldiers who were wounded and killed. “The president was wrong to diminish the role of NATO troops.”\n\nStarmer later called Trump’s comments about NATO troops “insulting and frankly appalling.”\n\n“I will never forget their courage, their bravery and the sacrifice they made for their country,” he said. “I consider President Trump’s remarks to be insulting and frankly appalling and I am not surprised they have caused such hurt to the loved ones of those who were killed or injured and, in fact, across the country.”\n\nStarmer said Trump should apologize for the comments.\n\nEven the Conservative Party blasted Trump’s remarks, with Tory leader Kemi Badenoch calling them “absolutely appalling” and “disgraceful,” according to The Telegraph.\n\nConservative member of Parliament Ben Obese-Jecty, who served in Afghanistan as a captain in the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, said it was “sad to see our nation’s sacrifice, and that of our NATO partners, held so cheaply by the president of the United States,” according to ABC.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nThe president’s dumping on NATO troops was reminiscent of his previous comments about Americans who died in combat being “suckers” and “losers.”\n\nDuring a trip to France in 2018, the president said American soldiers who died on French soil during WWI were “losers,” and that U.S. Marines who helped halt the 1918 German advance toward Paris were “suckers” for dying at the hands of the enemy.\n\nThe White House denied reports of the comments, which were revealed by The Atlantic magazine in 2020, but they’re just one example of the president disparaging military veterans and their families.\n\nIn December, he struggled to muster much sympathy for the families of Americans—many of them U.S. military veterans—who have died fighting in Ukraine.\n\nHe has mocked the late Sen. John McCain’s war injuries, publicly insulted the parents of a 27-year-old soldier who died in a car bombing in Iraq, and privately raged about the funeral costs for a female soldier who was murdered by a male soldier at Fort Hood.",

    "description": "Military competition between the US and rivals Russia and China in the Arctic is exposing weaknesses in the US arsenal.",
    "fullText": "For war across the freezing Arctic battlefields, the US faces a problem: it doesn't have the right weapons or tools to reliably detect threats in the region and respond to them quickly.\n\nThe Arctic is an unforgiving place for a war. It's a location where distances are vast, subzero temperatures can cripple equipment, and forces must operate with limited support infrastructure, but as competition with US rivals and adversaries becomes fiercer, there is a growing realization that a future fight could unfold across an Arctic battlespace. Among experts and officials, there's also increasing concern about US readiness.\n\nIf US forces in the region can't spot threats early, position assets effectively, and sustain troops in harsh conditions, the region could become a corridor for undetected attacks.\n\nGaps in Arctic defenses have been one element of President Donald Trump's erratic rhetoric on US interests in the acquisition of Greenland. He has said it is necessary for the substantial US missile defense project known as Golden Dome.\n\n\"If there is a war, much of the action will take place on that piece of ice,\" Trump said on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"Think of it: those missiles would be flying right over the center.\"\n\nThe president isn't the first to call attention to the strategic and national security implications surrounding the Arctic. Warnings have come from across administrations.\n\nLeaders in Washington have expressed similar concerns about the importance of the Arctic region for homeland defense in recent years. In its 2024 Arctic strategy doctrine, the US Department of Defense emphasized the need for better, more modernized all-domain awareness, surveillance and sensors, naval capabilities, and missile warning technologies. Existing systems, the department said, weren't sufficient for the growing threats in the region.\n\nSpecifically, the US, along with some of its NATO allies, has underinvested in capabilities needed to detect, track, and respond to activity across vast Arctic distances.\n\nSome necessary capabilities include aerial and underwater surveillance, as well as defense and naval warfare capabilities like anti-submarine frigates, heavy icebreakers, polar-capable multi-mission surface vessels, and dual-use sealift capacity, Liselotte Odgaard, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, wrote in a new report. Infrastructure such as undersea sensor networks, command and control systems, ports, runways, and roads is also lacking.\n\n\"As a result, the US and its allies have insufficient monitoring, response, and sustainment options,\" she explained. \"These shortfalls allow adversaries to transit waters and territories undetected, sustain forces in combat theaters for prolonged periods, and successfully challenge allied forces in combat-like situations.\"\n\nUS presence, whether through domain awareness or more constant exercises in the region, has also been lacking, leaving the Arctic as the \"shortest and least defended threat sector,\" former deputy commander of US Northern Command, Army Gen. Thomas Carden, said in 2024.\n\nWith recognition of the challenges has come new efforts. Recent moves, like the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Coast Guard’s fiscal year 2026 budget, have included millions of dollars for new icebreakers, Coast Guard cutters, and needed Arctic infrastructure upgrades. The Coast Guard’s newly renamed Arctic District has taken on a more prominent monitoring role, and last year, the service received its first polar icebreaker in over 25 years.\n\nAdditionally, the US is working to field new air defense systems and interceptors to replace or supplement the ones in Alaska. And the Space Force's 2026 budget includes billions for Golden Dome, specifically space-based sensors and interceptors, and modernization efforts at Pituffik Space Base in Greenland.\n\nBut key areas remain underdeveloped.\n\nAs Odgaard wrote in her new report, parts of the airspace over eastern Greenland and the North Pole are not consistently surveilled, and the submarine detection and tracking capabilities along Greenland's eastern coast fall short of what is needed.\n\nThose gaps are concerning as Russia focuses on expanding submarine operations in the Arctic.\n\nUncrewed systems, both naval and aerial drones, could, in theory, extend surveillance coverage across vast areas that are expensive and difficult to patrol without increasing the demand on traditional crewed aircraft and assets.\n\nThe harsh Arctic environment could challenge such efforts. With drones, it could stress their batteries, range, connections, and performance. Recent exercises have shown troops that temperatures below freezing, low visibility, snowy or icy conditions, and strong winds can degrade aerial drones and other equipment.\n\nThe US' renewed investments in preparation for Arctic warfare come as Russia and China are deepening cooperation and more actively pursuing interests in the region. Russia has been looking to expand where its submarines can operate as China positions itself strategically as a \"near Arctic\" nation, joining Russia on joint patrols, including ones near Alaska. China is also investing in naval capabilities, ships, and drones for the region.",

    "fullText": "While the US military has pursued ambitious technological advances, manpower remains one of its core pillars.\n\nFrom high-ranking generals to soldiers on the field, human troops remain a key way to assess the reach and power of the world's militaries.\n\nUsing data from the International Institute for Strategic Studies' 2025 Military Balance report, Business Insider ranked countries by the size of their active armed forces and listed their defense budgets, based on 2024 figures.\n\nActive-duty force size is a tally of a country's uniformed troops: airmen, soldiers, sailors, special operators, and Marines. Armies, in particular, depend on size to gain and occupy ground. Militaries can also be a tool of domestic repression, a focus that undercuts its capabilities against an external foe. North Korea, for example, is one of the world's most repressive states, led by a dictator who has repeatedly threatened neighboring South Korea.\n\nThe number of active-duty military personnel is far from the only factor that matters when comparing military power between countries, but it shows latent power that could be augmented via conscription and calling up reservists.\n\n\"Numbers have value, but there's a lot more to military capability,\" said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, DC-based foreign policy and national security think tank.\n\nIISS, a London-headquartered think tank, counts active armed forces, reservists, and paramilitaries as separate categories in its analysis, showing a fuller picture of each nation's manpower.\n\nSome countries have significantly higher numbers of reservists than others — Vietnam has the largest number in the world, estimated at 5 million.\n\nBut while reservists can aid militaries when needed, the quality and longevity of their expertise can vary between conscription- and volunteer-based systems, Cancian told Business Insider.\n\n\"When you look at some countries' reserve numbers, you're often looking at people who haven't trained in 10 or 20 years,\" he said. \"It gives you a big number, but their military value is questionable.\"\n\nAnd while paramilitaries can be effective at enforcing internal security and party strength, Cancian says that \"as a military force, they have essentially zero value.\"\n\nEven when accounting for all of a military's manpower, personnel is only one of the various factors that can qualify a nation's military strength, which also include equipment and readiness.\n\nThere's also the role of technologies in global warfare, the size and sophistication of air forces and naval fleets, amphibious capabilities to land assault forces, command and control systems, or nuclear forces, which all shape military power. Larger and more advanced forces require higher state expenditures.\n\nStill, comparing global manpower offers insight into how countries prioritize military power.\n\nSee how the world's largest militaries stack up.",

    "description": "Despite geopolitical upheaval, sanctions, and military action, this South American state's proven oil reserves remain colossal.",
    "fullText": "When it comes to oil-rich countries, one would usually think of Middle Eastern nations like Saudi Arabia or Iraq. But what many do not know is that the country with the largest oil reserves in the world lies just 1,200 miles to the south of Florida — or about a three-and-a-half-hour flight across the Caribbean. This is the state of Venezuela, and the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that its oil reserves are at more than 303 billion barrels, as of 2025.\n\nMost of Venezuela's oil is in the Orinoco Belt, a swathe of land north of the Orinoco River, but extracting it poses an unusual set of challenges. The country's oil infrastructure needs to be overhauled due to years of mismanagement and corruption and a history of asset seizures from private companies by the state. The country is also under U.S. sanctions, which limit its ability to sell oil overseas.\n\nVenezuela's crude oil isn't easy to process, either. Saudi Arabian and American oil fields produce light, sweet crude oil, which contains very little sulfur, and isn't corrosive to pipes and equipment. On the other hand, Venezuelan oil is much harder to process because it's mostly heavy and sour, making it harder to process crude oil into unleaded gasoline. Prof. Paasha Mahdavi of the University of California, Santa Barbara, told NPR that it's \"among the dirtiest oils in the world to produce when it comes to global warming.\"\n\nAside from Venezuela, other countries that have massive reserves include Saudi Arabia (267 billion barrels), Iran (208 billion barrels), Iraq (145 billion barrels), and the United Arab Emirates (113 billion barrels). The United States sits in the top eight, with an estimated 45 billion barrels of crude oil in reserve.\n\nOne thing that allowed the U.S. to massively increase its oil reserves and become one of the top 10 countries with the largest oil reserves is the development of fracking. Unlike traditional oil extraction techniques, which siphoned oil deposits from porous material, fracking pumps a special type of fluid deep underground to break the dense rock that holds the oil and make it easier to extract.\n\nOther nations are continually exploring to find new oil fields within their borders, and the U.S. made a new discovery in Texas in January 2026, which potentially has 1.6 billion barrels of oil. So, if there's a new substantial find or new technologies are developed to efficiently extract more oil from existing wells, then it's possible that another state can overtake Venezuela as the largest oil reserve holder in the world.",

    "description": "President Trump called the UK's decision to give away the Chagos Islands \"an act of great stupidity\" and a reason for the US to acquire Greenland.",
    "fullText": "That is what President Donald Trump called the UK's decision to give away a group of islands where a strategic military base is located.\n\nThe Diego Garcia military base is a cornerstone of US and allied power projection across the Indo-Pacific, the Middle East, and parts of Africa. As the UK moves to transfer sovereignty of the islands, its strategic importance has turned the base into a political and diplomatic flash point.\n\nThe island's strategic location has long made it especially valuable for US military operations, including long-range bomber missions and naval deployments — a role underscored by satellite images last year showing US bombers operating from the base.\n\nLocated in the Chagos Islands, Diego Garcia became the site of a US-UK military installation after Britain forcibly removed the native Chagossian people in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Seven years ago, in 2019, the International Court of Justice ruled that the removals were unlawful and said that the UK should relinquish control of the islands.\n\nThe UK has since reached a deal to transfer the sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius, near Madagascar, while allowing Diego Garcia to remain under British control on a 99-year lease, with an option to renew. The arrangement is expected to cost the UK about $136 million a year.\n\nThe UK government's decision was previously praised by the Trump administration as a \"monumental achievement\" that secured \"the long-term, stable, and effective operation of the joint US-UK military facility at Diego Garcia.\"\n\nTrump's assessment appears to have shifted.\n\n\"Shockingly, our 'brilliant' NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital U.S. Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER,\" the president wrote on Truth Social Tuesday.\n\nHe said there was \"no doubt\" that Russia and China had \"noticed this act of total weakness,\" arguing that the UK \"giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY.\"\n\nHe stressed that the move \"is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired.\" Trump has been increasingly focused on taking control of Greenland lately. He has argued its needed for Golden Dome, among other reasons.\n\nThe British prime minister's office told the BBC that \"the president explicitly recognised its strength last year,\" adding that the Five Eyes intelligence agencies also approved of the transfer.\n\nTrump said at the White House later on Tuesday that the deal had changed from its original format. \"I think they should keep it,\" he said.\n\nDiego Garcia has been a secretive military installation for the US and UK since the early 1970s. It's extremely remote, far from nearby landmasses, and strategically placed so that the US and UK have air power and maritime reach from the Indian Ocean toward the Middle East, Indo-Pacific, and Africa.\n\nThe base hosts units from the US Navy, Air Force, and Space Force, as well as the UK Royal Navy. Due to its geographical location, Diego Garcia is also critical for refueling operations for military aircraft and vessels. American bombers, such as B-1 Lancers, B-2 Spirits, and B-52 Stratofortresses, have been seen at the base, as well as nuclear-powered submarines.\n\nFrom Diego Garcia, US bombers launched attacks in Afghanistan after 9/11 and against Iraq during the 2003 invasion. And in 1991, the installation was central to US attacks during the first Gulf War. The base was crucial to the logistics operations supporting Middle Eastern missions, keeping aircraft nearby and operational.\n\nThe B-2 bomber holding the record for the longest bombing run in history landed at Diego Garcia after flying over 44 hours from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri in 2001.\n\nIn June 2025, prior to US attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities, or Operation Midnight Hammer, experts speculated that a significant B-2 bomber presence spotted at Diego Garcia could be involved in some sort of strike on Iran. Imagery at the time showed a notable force posture there. The actual strike, however, involved a B-2 bomber task force that flew out of the US.",

    "fullText": "Jan 19 (Reuters) - Ukraine's armed forces are introducing a new facet of air defence to transform their system, made up of small ​groups deploying interceptor drones, as the country braces for new mass ‌Russian attacks, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday.\n\nUkraine is still reeling from a wave of Russian ‌strikes earlier this month that knocked out power and heating to thousands of apartment blocks, particularly in the capital Kyiv.\n\nZelenskiy has repeatedly called for air defences to be strengthened, including increased assistance from Ukraine's Western allies.\n\n\"There will be a ⁠new approach to the use ‌of air defences by the Air Force, concerning mobile fire groups, interceptor drones and other 'short-range' air defence assets,\" Zelenskiy said ‍in his nightly video address.\n\n\"The system will be transformed.\"\n\nThe president announced the appointment of a new deputy Air Force Commander, Pavlo Yelizarov, to oversee and develop the innovation.\n\nUkraine ​has rapidly developed its drone manufacturing system since Russia launched its invasion ‌of its smaller neighbour in February 2022, and has emphasised interceptor drones as an effective and economical way to parry Russian strikes.\n\nIn his remarks, Zelenskiy warned Ukrainians to be \"extremely vigilant\" ahead of anticipated new Russian attacks.\n\n\"Russia has prepared for a strike, a massive strike, and is waiting for the moment to ⁠carry it out,\" he said, urging every ​region in the country to \"be prepared to respond ​as quickly as possible and help people\".\n\nBoth Zelenskiy and Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha warned at the weekend that Ukrainian intelligence had ‍noted Russia was ⁠conducting reconnaissance of specific targets, particularly substations that supply nuclear power plants.\n\nThe president also said he had instructed Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko to make ⁠decisions this week regarding difficulties from the recent attacks, including bonuses for tens of thousands of ‌emergency crew members restoring heating and electricity.",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum quelled concerns on Monday about two recent movements of the U.S. military in the vicinity of Mexico that have the country on edge since the attack on Venezuela.\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration urged U.S. aircraft operators to “exercise caution” when flying over the eastern Pacific Ocean near Mexico, Central America and parts of South America, citing “military activities.”\n\nThe president said her administration waited a couple hours until the U.S. government provided “written” assurance that there would not be any U.S. military flights over Mexican territory. She said the U.S. government had not given Mexico a heads up about any military operations.\n\nThe U.S. government provided precise coordinates for where it was operating and Mexican authorities issued a statement saying the FAA advisory had no implications for Mexico.\n\nThen, images of a U.S. military transport airplane on the tarmac at Toluca’s airport about 39 miles (63 kilometers) west of Mexico City began circulating on social media.\n\nSen. Clemente Castañeda, of the opposition Citizen Movement party, posted on social platform X asking for an explanation from the government, because Mexico’s senate is supposed to approve sending Mexican troops abroad or allowing foreign troops into Mexico.\n\nSheinbaum described it as a “logistical” operation that did not require senate approval.\n\n“The United States plane landed, public servants got on that plane and they went (to the U.S.) for training,” Sheinbaum said. “Who authorized this? The Secretary of Defense.”\n\nHer security cabinet had posted on X Sunday night that such training operations “occur in conformity with established protocols and in adherence to the bilateral collaboration agreements.”\n\nBoth events highlighted the sensitivity created by not only the Trump administration’s unilateral action to capture Venezuela's then-President Nicolás Maduro earlier this month, but the subsequent renewal of offers and threats to take direct military action against the drug cartels in Mexico.\n\nSheinbaum and Trump spoke again last week on the subject. Both governments continue to say they will collaborate on security issues, with Mexico emphasizing that it will not accept violations of its sovereignty.\n\nSecurity officials from both countries are scheduled to meet again Friday in an effort to “continue delivering tangible actions to strengthen security cooperation and meaningful outcomes to counter cartels, and stop the illicit flow of fentanyl and weapons from crossing our shared border,” according to a joint statement released last Thursday.",

    "fullText": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is getting the message: He’s vulnerable to the same quick hit that President Trump ordered to pluck Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro from power and toss him into custody in New York.\n\nThe brazen Jan. 3 raid on Caracas by U.S. forces almost certainly struck more fear into the potbellied dictator than any military drills or aerial shows of force ever could. In doing so, it’s also ramped up the risks of a potential nuclear showdown as Kim goes into panic mode, triggered by the same American president who has routinely boasted of the pair’s “very good relationship.”\n\n“The operation to ‘rendition’ the president of Venezuela demonstrates the capabilities that have to be of concern to North Korea,” says Sydney Seiler, former national intelligence officer for North Korea at the National Intelligence Council. The word “rendition,” as used by Seiler, is CIA-speak for capturing an enemy operative and sending him elsewhere for prosecution, or even torture and killing.\n\nThe other key word is “decapitation,” which Kim is well aware the Americans have been practicing in annual military exercises for years. “What’s appealing is that decapitation is the quickest way to terminate a conflict,” Seiler, who visited North Korea on negotiating teams before the North cut off all communications after the failure of Kim’s meetings with Trump in 2019, told the influential Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\n“Decapitation would be helpful in trying to deter North Korea,” Seiler believes. “Without Kim Jong Un,” he notes, North Korea would have no leader, no one who would know how to lead its outsized, underfed armed forces of 1.2 million troops, much less anyone in charge of its nuclear program.\n\nKim betrayed his deepest fears of a plot like the fracas in Caracas by authorizing release for North Korean audiences of a film all about the capture of Maduro. The film “Days and Nights of Confrontation,” could not have aired on North Korean state TV at a more propitious moment, days after elite U.S. troops seized Maduro and his wife. The message is clear: what’s to stop the Americans from repeating themselves in North Korea?\n\nThe film epitomizes “the trend of racy, Hollywood-style content aimed at appealing to young people,” says a South Korean website, NK News, that tracks North Korea. “Surely Mr. Kim and his family, including his fiery younger sister Yo-Jong, and his beloved teenage daughter, Ju-ae, would make great targets.” In one fell swoop the Americans could wipe out the dynasty that Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il-Sung, founded when the Soviet Union installed him as leader of the northern half of the divided Korean peninsula after the Japanese surrender in 1945.\n\nCapturing Kim is not a new idea for American “rendition” experts.\n\n“Some White House aides believed his death would paralyze his country,” writes Joel Wit, who also joined negotiating teams to North Korea, inspecting the nuclear site at Yongbyon north of Pyongyang after North Korea signed an agreement in 1994 to stop producing nukes. “Go get Kim Jong Un, we were postured to do that,” says Wit in his tell-all book, Fallout: The Inside Story of America’s Failure to Disarm North Korea. One official is quoted as saying: “Everyone, including the North Koreans, knew killing him as part of the war plan.”\n\nMaybe the U.S. would have to marshal more than the 150 or so aircraft, and a few hundred troops, including the U.S. Army’s elite Delta Force, that were needed to grab Maduro, but Kim is well aware his family and entourage could be hustled aboard a helicopter bound for an American warship long before the Russians and Chinese could respond in support of North Korea’s military establishment, ill-fed, ill-trained and not at all ready to leap to their leader’s instant defense.\n\nIf capturing Kim sounds like mission impossible, consider his frequent appearances inspecting industrial and agricultural projects, reviewing troops, and presiding at ceremonies. He also shows up periodically at missile launches, perhaps the best time of all to catch him just as he’s making a show of pressing the button. The Americans, moreover, are steeped in the knowledge of what it will take to get him. U.S. forces have been training for years to go after him. Annual U.S.-South Korean exercises once routinely wound up with a mock “decapitation” of “the North Korean leader,” without explicitly naming Kim.\n\nThe U.S. command in Korea dropped the word “decapitation” from the war games in deference to their South Korean ally, who reminded them such language might not help in attempts at fruitless talks with the North Koreans, who now refuse to talk anyway. The word is gaining currency again with Maduro’s capture—while raising the question in Pyongyang of who might come next on the American hit list.\n\n“North Korea’s Kim expected to cling to [his] nuclear security blanket after Venezuela,” blared one headline in the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post. “The United States’ decapitation operation against Venezuela will reinforce North Korea’s nuclear ambitions,” read another. That warning should prompt Trump to act quickly to get rid of a nuisance who’s been plaguing the region for years with bombastic harangues, threatening his enemies with a nuclear holocaust while his own people suffer from hunger and disease.\n\nFlights of heavy American bombers do little or nothing to remove the threats posed by America’s foes. Kim knows he can laugh off another aerial show of intimidation or a useless meeting with Trump. The threat of a Maduro-style capture is far more effective. Kim’s worst fear is that the Americans, after rehearsing “decapitation” for years, will decide it’s time to finally put their plan into effect, stifling Asia’s leading terrorist just as suddenly as they whisked Maduro and his wife off to jail in New York.",

    "description": "Oleksandr Syrskyi said that Russia is currently producing 404 Shaheds \"of various types\" per day.",
    "fullText": "Russia has plans to more than double production of its Iranian-designed attack drones to 1,000 per day, said Ukrainian Armed Forces' commander in chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi.\n\n\"The enemy plans to significantly increase production to use up to 1,000 drones per day,\" Syrskyi said of these drones.\n\nHe was speaking in an interview published on Sunday by the local media outlet LB.Ua, in which he commented on a wide range of topics, including the effectiveness of Ukraine's deep strikes into Russia and the balance of power in drone warfare.\n\nSyrskyi gave a precise assessment of Russia's current Shahed manufacturing, saying that Moscow can now produce 404 Shahed drones \"of various types\" every day.\n\nThese Russian delta-wing drones are closely modeled after Iran's loitering munitions. Moscow manufactures its own versions, dubbed Gerans, as well as cheaper decoys called Gerberas.\n\nRussia typically deploys a mix of strike drones and decoys when launching long-range attacks into Ukraine, and can send hundreds in a single night.\n\nSyrskyi did not say if Russia's daily Shahed production included Gerberas, nor did he break down exact production figures for each type of Shahed-type drone. The Geran-1 and Geran-2, propeller-driven drones that can fly up to 115 mph, are more common than the faster, jet-powered Geran-3.\n\nLaunching 1,000 Shahed-type drones a day would be a massive surge in Russia's attack capability. Moscow has generally been deploying 5,000 to 6,000 Shaheds a month against Ukraine, and half to four-fifths of these are usually strike variants.\n\nPer an analysis by the Institute for Science and International Security, Russia launched an average of 166 Shahed drones per day in December 2025. However, it's known to sometimes pause or reduce the intensity of its strikes to accumulate a stockpile for later use in a single large wave.\n\nCost is a major advantage for Shaheds. Each is estimated to cost between $20,000 and $70,000, making it cheaper and easier to manufacture than a conventional missile and providing Russia with a way to scale up its strike capability more sustainably.\n\nResource-strapped Ukraine has responded by seeking cheaper complements for its air defense network, including the growing use of small interceptor drones.\n\nStill, Russia's monthly use of Shahed-type drones has remained largely stagnant for the last six months. Moscow has, meanwhile, been experimenting with the loitering munitions, such as equipping them with air-to-air missiles or rear-facing cameras.\n\nSyrskyi's public assessment also comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned on Friday that his country was running low on ammunition for Western-supplied air defense systems.\n\nZelenskyy said that Ukraine had just secured a replenished stock of those munitions, but before that, it was fielding \"several systems without missiles.\"\n\n\"Today I can say this openly, because today, I have those missiles,\" he said.\n\nAs for other drones used in the war, Syrskyi said that Russia and Ukraine were now evenly matched in production quantity. Both Kyiv and Moscow have sporadically claimed the advantage on this front in recent years.\n\n\"The question is in quality. In conventional drones, quality is on our side. In fiber optics, unfortunately, we are only catching up with the enemy,\" Syrskyi said.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican lawmakers are scrambling to contain President Donald Trump's threats of taking possession of Greenland, with some showing the most strident opposition to almost anything the Trump administration has done since taking office.\n\nThey gave floor speeches on the importance of NATO last week. They introduced bills meant to prevent the U.S. from attacking Denmark. And several traveled to Copenhagen to meet with Danish counterparts.\n\nBut it's not clear that will be enough, as the president continues to insist that he will take control of the Arctic island. It's raised fears of an end to NATO — a decades-old alliance that has been a pillar of American strength in Europe and around the globe — and raised questions on Capitol Hill and around the world about what Trump's aggressive, go-it-alone foreign policy will mean for world order.\n\n“When the most powerful military nation on earth threatens your territory through its president over and over and over again, you start to take it seriously,” Sen. Chris Coons told The Associated Press.\n\nThe Delaware Democrat organized the bipartisan trip to Denmark to “bring the temperature down a bit,” he said, as well as further talks about mutual military agreements in the Arctic. Republican Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska accompanied a handful of Democrats on the trip. Also, Republican lawmakers joined in meetings in Washington last week with the Danish foreign minister and his Greenlandic counterpart where they discussed security agreements.\n\nYet it's clear Trump has other ideas. He said Saturday he will charge a 10% import tax starting in February on goods from eight European nations because of their opposition to his Greenland plans.\n\nTrump said on social media that because of modern weapons systems “the need to ACQUIRE is especially important.”\n\nThe pushback to Trump's Greenland plans\n\nKey Republicans have made clear they think that forcefully taking Greenland is out of the question. But so far, they've avoided directly rebuking Trump for his talk of possessing the island.\n\nTillis on social media called Trumps tariff plans “bad for America, bad for American businesses, and bad for America’s allies.”\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters Thursday that “there’s certainly not an appetite here for some of the options that have been talked about or considered.”\n\nIn a floor speech, Thune's predecessor as Republican leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell, warned that an attempt to seize Greenland would “shatter the trust of allies\" and tarnish Trump's legacy with a disastrous foreign policy decision.\n\nRepublican and Democratic lawmakers alike see an obvious path to bolstering American interests in Greenland while keeping the relationship with NATO-ally Denmark intact.\n\nIn a meeting with lawmakers Thursday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt discussed how the countries could work together to develop critical mineral industries and military cooperation, Coons said. The diplomats also told the senators there is no evidence of Chinese or Russian activity in Greenland.\n\nTrump has made the argument that the U.S. should take Greenland before China or Russia do, prompting worry across Europe. Troops from several nations have been sent to Greenland in support of Denmark.\n\nMurkowski said on social media that “our NATO allies are being forced to divert attention and resources to Greenland, a dynamic that plays directly into Putin’s hands by threatening the stability of the strongest coalition of democracies the world has ever seen.”\n\nLawmakers are looking at a few options for taking a military attack on Greenland off the table. Still, the Trump administration has shown little if any willingness to get congressional approval before taking military action.\n\nLawmakers, including Republicans like Murkowski, are pushing legislation that would prohibit Department of Defense funds from being used to attack or occupy territory that belongs to other NATO members without their consent.\n\nThe Alaska senator also suggested Congress could act to nullify Trump's tariffs. Murkowski and several other Republicans have already helped pass resolutions last year meant to undo tariffs around the globe, but those pieces of legislation did not gain traction in the House. They would have also required Trump's signature or support from two-thirds of both chambers to override his veto.\n\nDemocrats have also found some traction with war powers resolutions meant to force the president to get congressional approval before engaging in hostilities. Republicans last week narrowly defeated one such resolution that would prohibit Trump from attacking Venezuela again, and Democrats think there could potentially be more Republicans who would support one applying to Greenland.\n\n“What I’ve noticed is these war powers resolutions, they do put some pressure on Republicans,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat who has forced votes on several similar resolutions. He said the tactic has also compelled the Trump administration to provide lawmakers with briefings and commitments to get congressional approval before deploying troops.\n\nStill, while dismissing the Venezuela war powers resolution on Wednesday, Republican leaders made the argument that the legislation should be ruled out of order because the Trump administration has said there are currently no U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela.\n\nThat argument may set a precedent for future war powers resolutions, giving Republicans a way to avoid voting against Trump's wishes.\n\n“If you don't have boots on the ground, it's a moot point,” said Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, about war powers resolutions in general. He also argued that the prospect of taking Greenland over the objections of Denmark is nothing \"more than a hypothetical.”\n\nOther Republicans have expressed support for Trump's insistence that the U.S. possess Greenland, though they have downplayed the idea that the U.S. would take it by force.\n\nThat's left the strongest objections on the Republican side of the aisle coming from a handful of lawmakers who are leaving Congress next year.\n\nRep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, told The Omaha World Herald that an invasion of Greenland would lead to Trump's impeachment — something he would “lean” towards supporting.\n\nTillis, another retiring Republican, has directed his criticism at Trump advisors like White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller.\n\n“The fact that a small handful of ‘advisors’ are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid,” he said.",

    "fullText": "Of all the explanations for Donald Trump’s attempt to seize Greenland, the most superficially attractive is that the President has dementia. In which case, why not just pretend to give it to him? Fly him to somewhere that looks green, throw a military parade, and tell him that’s it. Senile fantasy fulfilled.\n\nAlas, the rot goes so much deeper. Trump is not mad, he’s doing what America always does, just crassly and out in the open. This became clearer this week when I chanced upon a copy of Lament for a Nation by the Canadian philosopher George Grant, published in 1965.\n\nGrant wrote at a turning point in his country’s history. In 1957, Canada had elected a conservative PM called John Diefenbaker who was not unlike Nigel Farage or, indeed, Trump: populist, nationalist, deeply anti-Left. But when the Americans asked to put their nuclear weapons on his soil, Diefenbaker – to my surprise – said no.\n\nHe believed he had a right to do this because Nato is, on paper, an alliance of equals – and a necessity because once Canada became a missile base, all pretence of an independent foreign policy would end.\n\nThe business and cultural elite turned on Diefenbaker and the public kicked him out of office.\n\nAmerica, basking in the glow of Jack Kennedy, was then admired as the embodiment of modernity: nationalism seemed antiquated and eccentric. Thus, argued Grant, Canada’s nuclear surrender represented the final stage in a process of economic and cultural assimilation. A society so integrated into the American Way lacked not just the resources but, crucially, the imagination to stand on its own two feet.\n\nSo it goes with contemporary Europe, where American corporations dominate and profit, yet also avoid paying a lot of tax. Ireland, for example, has rightly denounced Trump’s tariff war on the nations that oppose his aggressive takeover of Greenland – yet the country is a model of globalist acquiescence at the cost of sovereignty. It has embraced free markets (low corporate taxes) and free movement (mass migration), with the result that Dublin is outwardly Irish – still beautiful – yet unaffordable and embroiled in a violent identity crisis.\n\nThese are economic policies that its elites justify as essential to modern nation building (“we need money, we need workers”), and it’s striking that the SNP has proposed doing similar things should Scotland gain independence. As Grant observed in 1965, the modern nation state can only develop by opening its arms to global capitalism, but global capitalism “entails the disappearance of those indigenous differences that give substance to nationalism.”\n\nIn short, American capital has made all of us rich, but it has also made us duplicates of the US. I’m convinced that many Britons are desperately unhappy, even mentally ill, because they don’t feel like themselves anymore.\n\nIt’s obvious in the way we now talk (badly) and emote (too often) but most apparent in our politics, which is imported and detached from our real history. Identity politics was Made in America: when federal agents shot and killed a protestor in Minnesota (murder in my book), Labour mayors felt obliged to write a letter of support for the Democrat mayor of Minneapolis. Why?\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, James Cleverly says his hero is Ronald Reagan, the Tories sell the good life in terms of Reaganite aspiration, and the infamous Jenrick memo, written to plot his defection to Reform, described him as the “new sheriff in town”. Its author spelt favourite without a “u”.\n\nThe party Rob joins has painted itself into a corner, having gambled its credentials on access to Trump and now forced to pretend there’s distance. Lo, even Brexit has been colonised. Outside of the European Union, said its Right-wing think-tankers, the only hope is a deal with America, a logic that even Keir Starmer has swallowed, pursuing regulatory alignment on the future of AI.\n\nOne suspects that for all Labour’s hatred of Elon Musk, it will never ban Twitter, because Trump will almost certainly apply sanctions.\n\nWe should not think of the President as un-American, as some embarrassed Americans call him, but the most American president ever, which is to say the ultimate liberal.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans, even if they disagree on practical policies, are both drawn from the philosophical tradition of liberalism, rooted in love of individual freedom, the unleashing of personal passion. Trump wants something, so he makes it happen. That’s what liberalism means, and it has infected us, too.\n\nIt’s why in the UK marriage and birth are out of style, pews are empty, and our top-rated TV show involves traitors killing faithfuls for cash (“she’s playing a blinder,” they say, as if human relations are a competitive sport).\n\nIf Britain is broken – and a country where the latest figures show 299,614 abortions a year, 40 for a cleft lip or palate, is definitely broken – it is because millions have chosen to maximise their freedom and wealth at the cost of social solidarity.\n\nThe Old Canada of John Diefenbaker, claimed Grant, was different because it combined the Tory paternalism of England with the ethics of French Catholicism, which said “virtue must be prior to freedom.” But these are gone, and Grant concluded that their demise was unavoidable because no nation can resist the power of America or the temptation of individualism.\n\nLiberalism ends, if not quite in world government, then in the whole world looking the same. What do the Japanese eat on Christmas Day? KFC.\n\nThis is why I watch the trade war for Greenland with distress and, I’m afraid, pessimism. Yes, Trump must be resisted. It is a question of dignity.\n\nBut until we Europeans wean ourselves off America, not just militarily or economically but psychologically, we really cannot function without it and will always surrender. It has dominated us for a long time; we’ve only noticed since the empire that pushed out investment suddenly started to suck it back in, a phenomenon that, again, is not unique to Trump. Joe Biden used subsidies and tax breaks to re-shore jobs in the US, away from the continent.\n\nThe irony is that alternative, more benign American political traditions do exist, but they’ve always been dismissed by Europeans as naive or dangerous because they wouldn’t bankroll our defence: libertarian among the Republicans, socialist among the Democrats. If only we’d had president Ron Paul or president Bernie Sanders. Greenland would go unmolested.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "I left the Marines to become an entrepreneur. While the skills I learned in the military helped my transition, I struggled with civilian work life.",
    "fullText": "When I left the Marines, it was not because I disliked the work. I had originally planned to serve 20 years and retire in uniform, but over time, new interests began pulling me in different directions.\n\nThe Marines are a 24-hour responsibility. Once you commit, your personal ambitions take a backseat. Eventually, I reached a point where I wanted to explore those ambitions — specifically, entrepreneurship — while I was still young enough to act on them.\n\nI made the decision to leave the service during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic — even though the civilian job market felt uncertain, and many encouraged me to stay.\n\nBut retired service members who had built businesses offered a different message. They helped me realize that the military equips people with more transferable skills than they often think. The transition resources on base reinforced that point, so I felt ready to move on.\n\nIn the Marines, I worked on amphibious operations and rotated through several roles. That variety helped me grow, but it also made choosing a civilian path harder.\n\nI had multiple strengths and enjoyed different aspects of my job, which meant I didn't leave with a single, defined plan. I had possibilities, but no fixed route.\n\nOnce I committed to transitioning, I wrote my goals down and worked toward them before my end date. Even with that preparation, the hardest part was simply starting. In the military, the steps are usually provided. In civilian life, you take every step on your own.\n\nI started to feel directionless, taking jobs in truck driving, sales, and real estate.\n\nI didn't realize how prepared I was until I stepped into civilian life. Public speaking, counseling skills, emotional discipline, and the habit of double-checking paperwork all became essential. Writing things down remained one of my strongest habits.\n\nThose small details sharpened my mind and made me more reliable. Clear communication and consistent structure helped me as I moved toward consulting and supporting clients.\n\nMy experience also helped me advance at key moments. One employer took a chance on me specifically because I had served in the military. Veterans continued to mentor me even when they could not offer opportunities. When I started consulting, I leaned heavily on my military experience, especially in developing structure and communication systems for clients.\n\nWorking multiple military jobs gave me broad experience, but entrepreneurship requires long-term focus. If you jump between strengths too quickly, you never grow one fully. I had to learn to slow myself down and commit to the task.\n\nThe cultural difference between military and civilian workplaces was larger than I expected. In the Marines, keeping everyone informed is a core rule. In civilian environments, information moves at different speeds. People communicate based on their roles, goals, or personal habits. Especially in smaller workplaces, communication can be inconsistent. I had to learn not to take those gaps personally.\n\nAccountability also functions differently. In the Marines, you trust that everyone is committed to the same mission. In civilian workplaces, people have different motivations. Some individuals seek career advancement, others desire stability, and others simply need a steady income. I struggled to adapt to that.\n\nThe military provided me with leadership experience, diverse skills, and a foundation that I still rely on. But I wish there had been stronger bridges between the military and civilian companies. Transitioning often felt like a jump when it should've felt like a path forward.\n\nLeaving the Marines did not mean starting over. It meant learning how to translate discipline, structure, and communication into a world that operates in a different way.\n\nThe biggest lesson was understanding that you cannot transition alone. You need civilians who can explain the environment you are entering and veterans who can share how they adapted.\n\nMy transition taught me that the qualities that made me effective in uniform still matter, but they must be applied with flexibility and adaptability. Civilian strategy requires patience, influence, effective communication, and a willingness to take the initiative and build your own steps.\n\nThe challenge is real, but so is the opportunity to rebuild with purpose.",

    "description": "Military veterans aged 65 face being mobilised under new powers to prepare the Armed Forces for war.",
    "fullText": "Military veterans aged 65 face being mobilised under new powers to prepare the Armed Forces for war.\n\nThe Government is set to increase the age at which the nation’s pool of retired soldiers, known as the strategic reserve, can be called upon from 55 to 65.\n\nThe new measures are being introduced as part of a new Armed Forces bill, which will be published in Parliament later.\n\nThe changes will make it easier to mobilise tens of thousands of former military personnel.\n\nThe Army has shrunk to its smallest number in more than 200 years, with just over 70,000 full-time, fully-trained troops ready to deploy to the frontline.\n\nUnder existing rules, the pool of retired soldiers can be called upon in the event of “national danger, great emergency or attack in the UK”.\n\nHowever, under the new changes, this will be lowered to “warlike preparations”, which is already the threshold for reservists who have recently left the Armed Forces.\n\nThe measures come amid fears Britain could be dragged into a full-scale war with Russia in a matter of years.\n\nDefence and security chiefs have repeatedly warned of the potential for large-scale war in recent months.\n\nAl Carns, the Armed Forces minister, said just before Christmas that war was “already knocking on Europe’s door” and that Britain had to be prepared for a conflict that was “bigger” than those fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nLast week, the UK announced it would be deploying troops to Ukraine, alongside France, if and when a ceasefire deal between Moscow and Kyiv is agreed.\n\nWhile it is unclear exactly how many troops could be involved, reports have suggested up to 7,500 UK personnel could be deployed.\n\nIf this figure is accurate, it would effectively mean that around 21,000 personnel would be committed to Ukraine – with one cohort deployed, another in training and a third recovering for operations there.\n\nHowever, military analysts have warned such a deployment would stretch the Armed Forces and would effectively become an “all of Army effort” to maintain.\n\nSources at the Ministry of Defence have pushed back against suggestions that 7,500 troops could be deployed, with insiders saying it could be lower.\n\nOn Friday, the Government pledged to spend £200m to upgrade armoured vehicles and buy new kit in preparation for the peacekeeping mission.\n\nThe proposed changes would come into force next year if approved by Parliament, the BBC reported.\n\nThe Government estimates there are around 95,000 people within the strategic reserve, including veterans from the Royal Navy, Army, and RAF.\n\nThese are different to the reserve forces, which comprise personnel who volunteer part-time to serve in the military. Currently, there are almost 32,000 active reservists across the three wings of the Armed Forces.\n\nThe military has struggled to recruit and retain personnel in recent years. The Army has suffered the most, having shrunk from more than 100,000 personnel in 2010 to just over 70,000 now.\n\nThe most recent figures show a very marginal increase in the number of people joining the military. But it is still at its lowest ebb since the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nMeanwhile, the Armed Forces is grappling with a £28 billion funding black hole over the next four years despite plans to boost defence spending.\n\nSir Keir Starmer was warned about the shortfall by the head of the military, Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Knighton, a few days before Christmas.\n\nOn Monday, Sir Richard admitted Britain did not have the cash to deliver its military ambitions, which were set out by the PM in June as part of the Strategic Defence Review.\n\nThe Chief of the Defence Staff told MPs on the Commons defence committee: “I’ll be completely honest with you – we will not be able to do everything that we would wish to do as quickly as we might want to do it.\n\n“If we wanted to do everything that’s currently in the programme and do all the extra things in the SDR [strategic defence review], could we do that with the budget that we have got? The answer’s no.”\n\nThis is despite Sir Keir having announced last year that defence spending would rise from 2.3 per cent of GDP to 2.6 per cent by 2027. Looser pledges were also made in the strategic defence review to hit 3 per cent in the early 2030s and 3.5 per cent by 2035.\n\nAs part of the Strategic Defence Review, Sir Keir vowed to build 12 new nuclear attack submarines and spend billions more on new defence technology.\n\nBritain’s military spending is the subject of increasing criticism, with a parliamentary report last year warning the country was not ready to defend itself against attack.\n\nEarlier this month, the UK fell down the global defence spending rankings, and is now Nato’s 12th-biggest spender in terms of GDP compared with third in 2021.\n\nNews of the latest shortfall is said to have prompted Sir Keir to order a key MoD document, the defence investment plan, to be overhauled.\n\nThe Defence Investment Plan, which will set out how the Government’s long-term defence plans will be paid for, was originally due to be published in the autumn. However, it now appears to be stuck in financial purgatory, with Sir Richard telling MPs the MoD “do not have a date” for when it will be released.\n\nIt prompted concerns that the Armed Forces could soon be forced to make sweeping cuts to balance the books.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "Venezuela relied on Russian air defense systems and Chinese radars, but its forces did not shoot down any US military aircraft.",
    "fullText": "The US expected \"significant resistance\" from Venezuela's air defense systems during the nighttime raid to capture the country's former president, Nicolás Maduro, a newly released memo reveals.\n\nThe heavily redacted memorandum from the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel sheds new light on the Trump administration's planning efforts ahead of the early January military operation, including what opposition US forces might face from Venezuela's military and what that meant for the helicopters carrying special operators into downtown Caracas to grab Maduro and his wife.\n\n\"It is expected that US forces will face significant resistance on the approach,\" T. Elliot Gaiser, an assistant attorney general, wrote in the December 23 memo that was made public this week. \"There are as many as 75 anti-aircraft battery sites along the approach route to Fort Tiuna,\" Gaiser cited planning information provided by the Department of Defense.\n\nFort Tiuna, or Fuerte Tiuna, is a major military installation in the capital city, Caracas, that hosts defense ministries, critical commands, official residences, and other strategic infrastructure, and it is where Maduro was believed to be during the raid. The US heavily bombed the base, with satellite imagery showing widespread destruction at the site in the aftermath.\n\nThe DOJ memo also noted that Maduro's wife, Cilia Flores, would likely be present at the base. It said that she is \"known to be more aggressive and combative\" than her husband.\n\nMore than 150 US warplanes participated in the American operation, named Operation Absolute Resolve, including fighter jets, bombers, and drones. Some of these aircraft carried out strikes against Venezuelan military targets, including surface-to-air missile systems, to clear a path for low-flying helicopters carrying the forces that apprehended Maduro and his wife.\n\nThe DOJ memo hinted at additional threats and noted that Venezuela possessed unspecified, due to the heavy redactions, \"weapons\" that \"are capable of downing the helicopters carrying\" the assault forces. It's possible this is a reference to the Russian Igla man-portable air defense systems, shoulder-launched missiles designed to hit low-altitude targets, but it's unclear.\n\nMaduro said prior to the raid that Venezuela possessed thousands of Igla launchers.\n\nVenezuela relied heavily on Russian-made systems for its air defense network — such as S-300 batteries, Buk systems, and S-125 Pechora launchers — and Chinese radars. These weapon systems are believed to have been older export variants, though still capable; however, reporting indicates that systems might have been offline or in storage at the time of the attack.\n\nThough there had long been questions about the readiness of Venezuela's air defense network, Pentagon planners still considered it necessary to neutralize it. \"Before the assault force arrives at Fort Tiuna,\" the memo said, aircraft \"will serve as an escort and clear emplaced anti-aircraft batteries as needed.\"\n\n\"Risks to the mission are significant. Success will depend on surprise,\" the DOJ memo, which reviews the legality of the US raid, warned at the time.\n\nVenezuela's air defenses did not shoot down any US military aircraft during the raid; Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said shortly after the mission ended that the systems had been quickly dismantled by American forces.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth later said it \"seems those Russian air defenses didn't quite work so well, did they?\"\n\nThe newly released DOJ memo, which details how the US could present this as a law enforcement operation rather than an act of war, wrote that \"in addition to the targets for pre-assault fire,\" the Department of Defense \"has identified three airfields that may be destroyed should it appear that fighters are being assembled there to intercept the assault force.\"\n\n\"The airfields will not be struck otherwise as they are dual use for military and civilian purposes,\" the memo adds. It was written more than a week before the raid, so it's unclear whether US planning may have been tweaked in the days leading up to the mission.\n\nSatellite imagery revealed damage at the Higuerote Airport on Venezuela's northern coast, dozens of miles east of Caracas, after the raid. Photos from the tarmac showed a destroyed air defense system and a wrecked light aircraft.\n\nAlthough the US didn't appear to have faced the substantial resistance it expected, it still faced some during the raid. American forces stormed Maduro's compound under heavy fire, and at some point, a helicopter took a hit, reportedly by gunfire, but it remained flyable.\n\nA defense official said that seven US service members were wounded in the raid. \"The fact that this extremely complex and grueling mission was successfully executed with so few injuries is a testament to the expertise of our joint warriors,\" they added.\n\nVenezuela and Cuba said dozens of their security personnel were killed during the raid.",

    "fullText": "Visitors to Pituffik Space Base in Greenland are greeted by a sign welcoming them to the \"top of the world.\"\n\nAs the US military's northernmost installation, Pituffik Space Base's operations include scientific research, space surveillance, and missile detection.\n\nGreenland's abundant natural resources and proximity to Russia and China have made it a valuable strategic asset since World War II — so much so that US President Donald Trump has often expressed his intent to purchase the autonomous Danish territory.\n\nVice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance visited the military base in March 2025 amid rising tensions between the US, Denmark, and Greenland.\n\nThose tensions have continued to flare as Trump has refused to rule out the use of military force to take control of Greenland. In a Truth Social post on Wednesday, Trump wrote that the US \"needs Greenland\" and \"anything less than that is unacceptable.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Denmark increased its military presence in Greenland, citing \"security tensions.\" Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio also met with the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland on Wednesday.\n\nHere's a look inside Greenland's only US military base.\n\nTrump first expressed interest in buying Greenland, the world's largest island and an autonomous Danish territory, during his first presidency. In addition to being rich in natural resources, Greenland's Arctic location is well-placed to further US interests by countering China and Russia.\n\nSince his reelection, Trump has repeatedly conveyed his desire to acquire Greenland and said he would not rule out the use of military force to take it.\n\n\"We need Greenland for national security. One way or the other we're going to get it,\" he said in his joint address to Congress in March 2025.\n\nBoth Denmark and Greenland's leaders have maintained that the island is not for sale.\n\nSecond lady Usha Vance was originally scheduled to visit Greenland on a solo trip in 2025 to \"visit historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersua, Greenland's national dogsled race,\" the White House said.\n\nInstead, the trip was scaled back. The vice president and second lady visited Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, the US military's northernmost installation, in March.\n\nUsha Vance's solo trip could have violated diplomatic protocol by sending a delegation to another country without an invitation. The amended plan — visiting a US base — avoided that potential violation. While Trump said that \"people from Greenland are asking us to go there,\" the government of Greenland said they had not invited any foreign delegations to visit.\n\n\"Just for the record, Naalakkersuisut, the government of Greenland, has not extended any invitations for any visits, neither private nor official,\" the government's official Facebook page wrote in a post on Monday.\n\nGreenland's then-prime minister, Múte Bourup Egede, also called Usha Vance's planned trip \"very aggressive\" in an interview with Sermitsiaq, a Greenlandic newspaper.\n\nTaylor Van Kirk, JD Vance's press secretary, told Business Insider at the time that the vice president and second lady were \"proud\" to visit the US military base in Greenland.\n\n\"As the vice president has said, previous US leaders have neglected Arctic security, while Greenland's Danish rulers have neglected their security obligations to the island. The security of Greenland is critical in ensuring the security of the rest of the world, and the Vice President looks forward to learning more about the island.\"\n\nWhile the US doesn't own Greenland, it has had a military presence there since World War II.\n\nPituffik Space Base, originally named Thule Air Base, was formally established in 1951 as part of a Cold War-era defense treaty between the US and Denmark. It is located in Pituffik, Greenland, 750 miles north of the Arctic Circle and halfway between New York and Moscow.\n\nAs a Danish territory, Greenland does not have a military of its own.\n\nAs the Pentagon's northernmost military base, Pituffik Space Base acts as a key Arctic defense outpost. Because of its location on the \"top of the world,\" it is an optimal vantage point for monitoring missile launches by US adversaries like Russia and establishing space superiority.\n\nThe base is the site of a phased-array radar, which can detect sea-launched and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and a surface-to-air missile system, which intercepts hostile threats.\n\nThe base has a Satellite Command and Control system to maintain real-time communications and data relay with military and intelligence satellites. Its high-altitude location also allows it to more frequently track polar-orbit satellites, which can monitor the entire Earth's surface over time as the planet rotates below them.\n\nBecause Pituffik's primary mission is space surveillance and missile warning, the space base doesn't house a permanently stationed fighter wing or naval fleet.\n\nInstead, it acts as a strategic logistics and defense hub for Arctic missions and under-ice operations. From the site, which is the world's northernmost deep-water seaport, surface vessels and submarines operated by the US Navy and allied forces conduct Arctic patrols and cold-weather training exercises.\n\nAircraft regularly fly in and out of the former air base, such as military cargo and refueling planes and maritime patrol aircraft. Occasionally, fighter jets and long-range bombers will fly to the base for Arctic deterrence deployments and training flights.\n\nWhile it doesn't have a permanent combat force, the Air Force does have one tugboat at Pituffik to support port operations, icebreaking, and maneuvering ships.\n\nA small but significant asset, the Rising Star helps keep supply routes open by breaking up and pushing floating ice. The tugboat guides supply ships through the port, making it a critical component in bringing fuel, food, and equipment to personnel year-round.\n\nHowever, since the base is locked in by ice for nine months of the year, the Rising Star gets limited use because it can only be operated when the port is completely ice-free.\n\nPituffik Space Base is surrounded by ice for nine months out of every year. The closest town, the Inuit village of Qaanaaq, is located 65 miles away.\n\nTemperatures can range from 60 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer, when there are 24 hours of daylight, to -50 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, when there is no sunlight for weeks.\n\nWinter storms are categorized into five levels from least to most severe: Normal, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, and Delta. At the Bravo level, the buddy system is implemented so that no one walks outside alone. Non-essential facilities close at the Charlie level, and personnel must shelter in place during Delta storms.\n\nAbout 150 personnel are stationed at Pituffik.\n\nThe Dundas Buffet Dining Hall on base serves three meals a day with payments accepted through a meal card.\n\nThe Base Exchange, also known as \"BX,\" sells groceries, toiletries, souvenirs, and other assorted goods. It also houses a barber shop.\n\nThere are no ATMs at Pituffik Space Base, but the Base Exchange accepts debit and credit cards as well as US dollars.\n\nPituffik Space Base features a bowling alley, a chapel, and a community center with a theater and craft room.\n\nThere's also a gymnasium and workout room stocked with weights and treadmills.\n\nPituffik Space Base's official Facebook page shows personnel participating in recreational events such as a Hawaiian-themed Arctic luau party, Greenlandic Heritage Week, and cross-country skiing.\n\nThe US built airbases and weather stations across the ice sheet during World War II as refueling stops on transatlantic flights and supply routes.\n\nTwo decommissioned airbases are now being used as civilian airports, and a third was abandoned after the war ended.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the US Air Force also built four stations on Greenland's coasts as part of a larger communication network of more than 60 radar installations to detect Soviet bombers. Most of the stations have since been deactivated, left to deteriorate atop Greenland's ice sheet.\n\nIn 2024, NASA scientists detected an underground base for a top-secret Cold War-era missile operation known as Camp Century. Now buried 100 feet under the ice, the abandoned network of subterranean tunnels once operated under the guise of an Arctic research facility before the US government declassified it in 1995.\n\nBut the abandoned military sites represent more than just relics of past global conflicts. Thousands of gallons of biological, chemical, and radioactive waste left behind on the bases pose a significant environmental threat, especially as the planet warms.\n\nThe US military failed to clean up decommissioned facilities like Camp Century, assuming the ice sheet would entomb the waste and infrastructure over the years.\n\nHowever, at the current melting rate of the Arctic, researchers estimate that the waste could resurface around 2100. The question remains as to who is responsible for cleaning up the waste from abandoned US military facilities scattered throughout Greenland.\n\nThe US has long pursued access to or control over Greenland due to its strategic and economic significance, dating back as early as the late 19th century.\n\nSince his return to the White House, Trump has continued to double down on his ambitions to secure the self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, saying he won't rule out military force or economic coercion to do so.\n\nThough the Danish government has remained steadfast in refusing the sale, Trump's so-called \"real estate deal\" has spotlighted Greenland's growing desire for independence from Denmark and disinterest in being owned by anybody, including the US.\n\n\"The time has come to stand together,\" Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said at a press conference on Tuesday, appearing with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. \"It has not been easy to stand up to completely unacceptable pressure from our closest allies for a lifetime. But there is much to suggest that the hardest part is still ahead of us.\"",

    "fullText": "US planning for the high-risk raid to apprehend Venezuela's former president, Nicolás Maduro, centered on a time when much of the country's military would be on holiday leave, a newly released memo reveals.\n\nThe December 23 memorandum from the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel offers fresh details about how the US planned to pull off the daring nighttime raid to capture Maduro in his fortified compound and transport him to New York to stand trial. The former leader has pleaded not guilty to the drug and weapons charges he faces.\n\nThe raid began late on January 2 and ran into the next day. President Donald Trump said on January 3 that the initial plan was for the operation to occur four days earlier, on December 30, but he decided to wait for better weather.\n\n\"The expected duration of the operation within Venezuelan territory is [redacted] hours,\" wrote T. Elliot Gaiser, a US assistant attorney general, wrote in the late December DOJ memo, which looks into the legality of the raid and was made public this week. Much of the planning section is blacked out.\n\n\"In order to minimize casualties, the strike will take place at 0100 am (local time) on a date where a maximum number of Venezuelan military would be on leave for the holidays,\" Gaiser wrote.\n\nIt's unclear how many soldiers were away when the US actually executed the operation in January. Dozens of Venezuelan and Cuban security personnel were killed, the two countries said after Operation Absolute Resolve concluded.\n\nThe DOJ memo, which cited Pentagon planning information and details how the US could effectively present the action as a law enforcement operation rather than an act of war, said that the US expected to encounter \"significant resistance\" from Venezuela's air defenses.\n\nThat anticipated resistance includes several dozen anti-aircraft systems on the approach to Fuerte Tiuna, a major military installation in Caracas where Maduro and his wife were believed to be and, indeed, were at the time of the operation.\n\nThe memo outlined how US aircraft would strike air defense systems to clear a path for assault forces to reach Tiuna. It said that the Pentagon aimed to target a local power switching station to keep the power off, which could explain Trump's post-raid remarks that a \"certain expertise\" was used to turn off the lights in Caracas.\n\nThe US could have also carried out a cyberattack or employed electronic warfare capabilities. \"Kinetic operations will be preceded by non-kinetic action,\" the memo said.\n\nThe memo was published several days before the raid, so it's unclear how US planning may have changed between the time it was written and the actual operation.\n\nDan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on January 3 after the raid that more than 150 US aircraft participated in the operation, including stealth jets, electronic attack aircraft, surveillance and reconnaissance planes, airborne early warning aircraft, bombers, and drones.\n\nMany of these aircraft targeted and engaged Venezuela's air defenses to clear a path for low-flying helicopters carrying the forces that stormed Maduro's compound and apprehended the former president and his wife, consistent with the planning memo.\n\nThe US didn't lose any aircraft during the raid. A helicopter took a hit but still remained operational, and a defense official said seven American service members were wounded during the night.\n\n\"Risks to the mission are significant,\" the memo said, adding that its \"success will depend on surprise.\" In the aftermath, Caine said the US achieved \"totally the element of surprise.\"",

    "fullText": "A new lawsuit from a Democratic senator and combat veteran at the heart of a free speech fight seeks to block the Pentagon's intensifying crackdown.\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly sued Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday, warning that the Pentagon's effort to punish him \"sends a chilling message\" to veterans who speak out against the Trump administration. \n\nHegseth accused Kelly of \"seditious\" acts after Kelly publicly reminded US service members that they are not required to follow illegal orders. The Pentagon's actions against Kelly have troubling implications for the political speech of millions of veterans, military law experts said.\n\nHegseth's effort to muzzle a US senator \"places other retirees who have spoken up potentially in jeopardy,\" said Rachel VanLandingham, a professor at Southwestern Law School who is a retired Air Force JAG. \"Not knowing whether or not he's going to come after you already has a chilling effect.\"\n\nKelly said his lawsuit is about fighting back. The Democratic lawmaker announced the federal lawsuit on Monday. His suit also named the Department of Defense, Navy Secretary John Phelan, and the Navy Department as defendants. Kelly's video urging troops not to follow illegal orders.\n\nVeterans who serve 20 years or more are eligible for a military pension, but those benefits can be revoked or reduced if retirees are found to have violated military law while in uniform. By contrast, Hegseth's move seeks to punish a veteran for his speech long after serving in uniform, an approach one expert on military law called baseless.\n\nKelly's lawsuit argues that using the military justice system to punish veterans' political speech risks setting a precedent that abuses the First Amendment rights of other retired troops.\n\nThe lawsuit argues that nothing in the law allows the Pentagon to revisit a retirement determination based on a veteran's speech. Such a move, the filing says, would raise \"serious constitutional concerns\" and leave retired service members facing a constant threat to their earned benefits.\n\nThere's no legal basis for Hegseth's pursuit, VanLandingham said. The defense secretary initially sought to court-martial Kelly, threatening him with the military equivalent of a criminal trial. It later opted for a lesser administrative punishment.\n\n\"The process is the punishment,\" said Frank Rosenblatt, a retired Army JAG and professor at Mississippi College School of Law. \"The claim against Kelly had no merit.\"\n\n\"Senator Kelly's speech is not punishable under the UCMJ,\" the National Institute of Military Justice nonprofit group said in a December statement in reference to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to halt actions that could reduce Kelly's military rank and retirement pay and characterizes that effort as \"unlawful.\"\n\nAfter filing the lawsuit, Kelly requested a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction from the federal court, seeking to halt the Pentagon's actions while the case is reviewed on its merits. Both are emergency measures that ask a judge to stop government action before permanent harm occurs.\n\nThe federal government has been increasingly pushing cases important to the Trump administration onto a \"rocket docket,\" Rosenblatt said, accelerating litigation toward higher courts. If the judge assigned to the case, US District Judge Richard Leon, issues a ruling the government doesn't like, \"this could move very quickly to the DC Circuit and potentially the Supreme Court.\"\n\nLeon has previously ruled against the military's authority over retirees.\n\n\"I am not concluding today that Congress could never authorize the court-martial of some military retirees,\" Leon wrote in a 2019 memorandum opinion that rejected the government's argument that military jurisdiction over all retirees was necessary to maintain good order and discipline of its active force. The judge noted he had not seen a clear argument for \"why the exercise of such jurisdiction over all military retirees is necessary.\"\n\nIn a post on X last week, Hegseth called Kelly's video with five other Democratic lawmakers \"reckless and seditious\" and said it was \"clearly intended to undermine good order and military discipline.\"\n\nThe military justice provisions that Hegseth accused Kelly of violating — Articles 133 and 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice — are not explicitly tied to sedition and can cover a wide range of alleged misconduct.\n\nKelly's lawsuit argues that allowing the executive branch to punish a member of Congress for speech is a threat to the Constitution and erodes congressional oversight of the armed services.\n\n\"We are aware of the litigation,\" a Pentagon spokesperson said Tuesday when asked for comment on the lawsuit. \"However, as a matter of policy, the Department does not comment on ongoing litigation.\" That same day, Hegseth took aim at Kelly's military rank in an X post: \"'Captain' Kelly knows exactly what he did, and that he will be held to account.\"",
