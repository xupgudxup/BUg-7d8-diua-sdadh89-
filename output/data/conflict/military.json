    "description": "The US military has some strange rules for its troops unlikely to be found anywhere else",
    "fullText": "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's crusade against military facial hair is just the latest in a long line of rules you'd struggle to find anywhere else in American life.\n\nSome services ban chewing gum or sipping a drink while walking. However, one particularly strange rule for many troops, even when it's cold out, is no hands in pockets.\n\nThe rules and the strictness with which they are upheld vary among the different service branches. The Marine Corps and Army are among the toughest enforcers.\n\nFor some senior leaders, the restriction on putting hands in pockets is about discipline, uniformity, and maintaining a professional appearance — looking sharp, so to speak. But for service members, the rule can feel impractical and has spawned numerous Reddit threads devoted to the matter.\n\nMarines ban pocketed hands under almost all circumstances when not training, feeling that the look can \"detract from an appropriate military presence,\" according to the Corps' uniform manual. But when training outdoors, \"good judgment\" will govern whether Marines can put their hands in their pockets.\n\nThe Army's uniform regulations ban hands in pockets for any reason other than \"momentarily to place or retrieve objects.\"\n\nThe Navy previously barred sailors from putting their hands in their pockets but reversed course in 2024, allowing them to do so as long as having their hands in their pockets doesn't interfere with safety or saluting. (That same Navy decision also allowed for the return of the obscure Navy tiara.)\n\nThe Air Force has allowed its troops to put their hands in their pockets since 2021. A service news release at the time said the update was part of a broader effort to let troops determine how best to \"maintain standards\" without having commanders and rules \"specifying exact behavior in every situation,\" putting it on service members to figure out what's appropriate.\n\nBeyond guidelines on how service members use their pockets, plenty of other strange rules abound in the armed forces.\n\nUntil 2019, for instance, male Marines were not allowed to use umbrellas while in more formal \"service\" uniforms — women could, but men were expected to embrace the rain like stoic sea captains. Now they can all use umbrellas, unless they're wearing their camouflage utility uniforms, which are worn by the majority daily.\n\nSome troops also aren't allowed to carry gym bags with shoulder straps — those must be carried in one hand, especially with formal uniforms.\n\nMost troops can still travel in their camouflage uniforms, often seen in airports, although they are generally barred from wearing formal uniforms unless it's directly related to official military business.\n\nAnd for outdoor exercise, troops were long required to wear reflective neon belts and vests when running, walking, and so on, even in broad daylight. The Marines ditched that rule in 2015. In 2019, it took the Army's service secretary weighing to change those rules so that soldiers only wear glow belts at night.",

    "description": "A state polls showed that 55% of Russians believe what Moscow calls its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine will end next year.",
    "fullText": "The majority of Russians expect the war with Ukraine to end in 2026, according to a poll released Wednesday.\n\nThe survey of 1,600 Russians aged 18 and above found that 55% believe what Moscow calls its \"special military operation\" is nearing its end. The poll was conducted in mid-December by the state-owned Russian Public Opinion Research Center.\n\nMikhail Mamonov, the deputy head of the Russian Public Opinion Research Center, said as he presented the results at a roundtable discussion: \"The main reason for optimism is the possible completion of the special military operation and the achievement of the stated objectives, in line with the national interests outlined by the president.\"\n\nIn previous years, when revealing the results of its annual poll, the organization did not provide data on the share of Russians expecting the war to end. It is hard to assess public sentiment about sensitive subjects like the war in Russia due to the country's tightly controlled public discourse.\n\nThe result came as Russia's economic boom, driven by wartime spending and subsidies, cooled.\n\nIn November, Russia's industrial output fell 0.7% from a year ago, following a 3.1% increase in October, Rosstat, Russia's official statistics agency, said Wednesday. Reuters reported that day that analysts expected a 1.2% increase in output.\n\nThe profits of Russian companies declined nearly 10% to 21.6 trillion rubles, or $273.4 billion, from January through October.\n\nHigh — but moderating — inflation, weaker energy revenues, a strong ruble, and tight credit have weighed on consumer demand and real incomes, squeezing private-sector activity.\n\nA separate, independent poll of 1,608 Russians aged 18 and above showed that the economy and the war with Ukraine were their top concerns. The survey conducted between November 18 and 27 by the Levada Center was published December 16.\n\nIn a tightly choreographed phone-in event Friday with ordinary Russian citizens and journalists, known as the \"Direct Line,\" Putin acknowledged a sharp slowdown in economic growth — to 1% this year from 4.3% in 2024. He attributed it to government measures aimed at improving inflation.\n\nWhile Ukraine dominated the discussion, the broadcast was punctuated by flashes of public frustration, as text messages from viewers were displayed on a large screen in the hall, Reuters reported.\n\nThere were complaints about internet outages, poor water quality, and the rising cost of living — a reminder of how economic pressures affect the lives of Russians.",

    "fullText": "An explosion in Moscow on Wednesday killed three people, including two police officers, Russian investigators said, days after a car bomb killed a high-ranking general not far away.\n\nAn official from Ukraine’s military intelligence, known as GUR, told The Associated Press that the attack had been carried out as part of an agency operation. Another official from the agency said the police officers had taken part in Russia’s war in Ukraine, without providing details. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\n\nRussian authorities did not comment on who may be behind the attack. Since Moscow invaded nearly four years ago, Russian authorities have blamed Kyiv for several assassinations of military officers and public figures in Russia. Ukraine has claimed responsibility for some of them.\n\nOn Wednesday, two traffic police officers were approaching a suspicious individual when a device detonated, Russia's Investigative Committee spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko said in a statement. The officers and another person standing nearby died from their injuries.\n\nThe Interior Ministry named the officers as Lt. Ilya Klimanov, 24, who joined the Moscow police in October 2023, and Lt. Maxim Gorbunov, 25. Gorbunov had a wife and a 9-month-old daughter, the statement said.\n\nThe blast took place in the same area of the Russian capital where Lt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov was killed by a car bomb on Monday. Sarvarov was the head of the Operational Training Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces’ General Staff.\n\nInvestigators have said they are looking into whether Ukraine was behind that attack, which was the third such killing of a senior military officer in just over a year. Ukraine has not commented on it.\n\nUkraine — which is outnumbered by Russia’s larger, better equipped military — has frequently tried to change the course of the war by attacking in unexpected ways.\n\nIn August last year, Ukrainian forces staged a surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region even as they struggled to stem Russian offensives elsewhere. Moscow’s troops eventually drove them out, but the incursion diverted Russian military resources and raised Ukrainian morale.\n\nIn June, swarms of drones launched from trucks targeted bomber bases across Russia.\n\nMoscow has also blamed assassinations on Ukraine. Just over a year ago, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the chief of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed by a bomb hidden on an electric scooter outside his apartment building. Kirillov’s assistant also died. Ukraine’s security service claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nDays after Moskalik’s killing, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he received a report from the head of Ukraine’s foreign intelligence agency on the “liquidation” of top Russian military figures, adding that “justice inevitably comes” although he didn’t mention Moskalik’s name.\n\nMeanwhile, Western officials have accused Russia of staging a campaign of disruption and sabotage across Europe as part of an effort to sap support for Ukraine. Moscow has denied the claims.",

    "description": "The USS Nautilus, the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, participated in scientific and military operations around the world.",
    "fullText": "On January 17, 1955, the USS Nautilus transmitted a historic message: \"Underway on nuclear power.\"\n\nAs the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, Nautilus could remain submerged for two weeks at a time and travel at speeds of over 20 knots, or about 23 miles per hour.\n\nPreviously, World War II submarines powered by diesel engines and electric batteries could stay underwater for just 12 to 48 hours at a time. Since their batteries only charged while surfaced, diesel-electric US Navy vessels like the USS Cobia had to move at around 2 or 3 miles per hour to conserve power and hit maximum speeds of 9 knots, or about 10 miles per hour.\n\nNautilus is now part of the Submarine Force Museum in Groton, Connecticut. Visitors can walk through the historic nuclear submarine and see how its crew members lived and worked while submerged up to 700 feet below the surface.\n\nI visited the museum in March to tour Nautilus. Take a look inside.\n\nNautilus, which was commissioned in 1954, hosted the first-ever underwater legislative meeting when 13 members of Congress rode Nautilus in 1955.\n\nIts nuclear power allowed Nautilus to sail under the polar ice cap and become the first ship to traverse the North Pole in 1958 in an expedition known as Operation Sunshine.\n\nNautilus also participated in the naval blockade of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.\n\nAfter 26 years of service, Nautilus was decommissioned in 1980 and recognized as a National Historic Landmark in 1982. It opened to the public as part of the Submarine Force Museum in Groton, Connecticut, in 1986.\n\nIn 2021, Nautilus underwent $36 million of preservation work and reopened in 2022.\n\nThe Submarine Force Museum is open Wednesday through Monday and is free to visit.\n\nI was amazed by the size of the submarine. As I climbed aboard, the deck provided gorgeous views of the Thames River.\n\nHere, crew members loaded torpedoes for firing.\n\nAfter the torpedoes were loaded, the tubes were flooded with water. When the command to fire was issued, high-pressure air from the submarine's ejection pump then forced the water and the torpedoes out of the tubes.\n\nSigns on the sink and mirror indicated that they were part of the submarine's original equipment.\n\nNautilus had a crew of 11 officers and 105 enlisted service members.\n\nA panel of instruments along the wardroom's wall indicated Nautilus' depth and speed.\n\nOfficers ate the same meals as the rest of the crew members, but their food was brought up to the officers' pantry via a dumbwaiter to be reheated and served on Navy china.\n\nThe walls of the narrow hallway were covered in wood paneling.\n\nThe book was gifted to Nautilus' commanding officer, Commander William R. Anderson, in 1957 by the French Navy's chief of staff, Adm. Henri Nomy. The fictional submarine in the book is also named Nautilus.\n\nFewer beds in a room indicated a higher rank.\n\nThe executive officer, also known as the \"XO,\" was the ship's second-in-command.\n\nThe commanding officer used the stateroom as a workspace and living quarters.\n\nThe yeoman managed the ship's correspondence and personnel records.\n\nThe attack center contained periscopes to spot enemy ships and the controls to aim and fire torpedoes.\n\nOn the diagram, Nautilus is represented by the bottom ship, and the top ship represents the target.\n\nThe torpedo firing key, which was used to deploy the torpedoes, was indicated with a blue sign on the firing panel.\n\nThe guns were used for security while the submarine was in port.\n\nSonar stands for \"sound navigation and ranging.\" Active sonar emitted sound pulses to locate targets, while passive sonar listened for underwater activity.\n\nBefore that, ladders were used to climb from one level to another.\n\nCommands were issued in the control room by a crew member known as the diving officer of the watch, who received orders from the attack center.\n\nWhen the main ballast tanks filled with water, the submarine would submerge. When filled with air, the submarine would surface.\n\nThe ESM bay's instruments could detect other ships' radars.\n\nThe radio room was located just off the control room on the right.\n\nHere, crew members ate meals, worked, and spent their recreational time.\n\nDamage control personnel used OBAs if fires broke out on board while submerged. The hoses on the masks could be attached to the submarine's reserve air supply.\n\nSince there was no Navy chaplain on board the submarine, crew member volunteers conducted services for various faiths with items from the lay services box.\n\nNautilus was mainly powered by its nuclear reactor, but the battery served as an auxiliary source of power in case of an emergency.\n\nA window connected the galley to the scullery, where crew members washed dishes.\n\nNautilus had two crew quarters, one at the front of the submarine and one at the back.\n\nI swiveled the periscope until I could see my car sitting in the museum's parking lot, which was pretty cool.\n\nJust over 70 years after Nautilus was commissioned as the first nuclear-powered submarine in the world, all of the US Navy's submarines are now nuclear-powered, according to the Department of Defense.",

    "title": "Ukrainian soldiers have incredible tactical patience and are far happier moving slowly than the British military",
    "description": "The Ukrainians are \"are very happy being slow\" as they know they need to secure everything, a British military officer told BI.",
    "fullText": "Some Western trainers working with Ukrainian soldiers first assumed their trainees were \"a bit lazy\" when they insisted on moving slowly, a former instructor told Business Insider.\n\nBut as the British military officer helping lead the training watched them meticulously secure everything and learned why the Ukrainians were doing what they were doing, he realized it all made tactical sense. Rushing can be fatal, as a soldier could miss a trip wire, bunker, or some other danger lurking on the battlefield.\n\nMaj. Maguire, who spoke to Business Insider about his Operation Interflex experience on the condition that just his rank and last name be used, said there was a \"mindset difference\" between the Ukrainians and the British. It is distinct because Ukraine is in an existential fight with practical combat experience.\n\nFrom their experiences battling Russia, the Ukrainians had discovered that speed isn't always best; sometimes, moving slowly with patience is key to surviving the fight. Clearing a trench is an activity that demands soldiers move quickly, but others demand a slower pace, a higher degree of caution.\n\nIn an urban environment, they were fine with moving at a crawl — seizing a building and sitting on it for hours until they'd coordinated everything and fully understood their next step.\n\n\"They are very happy being slow,\" Maguire said.\n\nHe said the Ukrainians would take a long time to go through a door, \"because they will stop. They will look for wires, they will check absolutely everything on it.\" Doing all of that in a tactically safe way \"takes a long time.\"\n\nFor six months, until July 2024, Maguire led leadership training for Ukrainian soldiers who already had combat experience. His experience was the Ukrainian troops would not move on to the next house \"until they had every single potential firing hole, point, position, mine suppressed and looked after. They won't move until they've aligned the drones or the artillery behind it to do it.\"\n\nMaguire said that the British trainers were a bit impatient, as the mindset is \"you get in there, let's do it,\" but attitudes shifted as they talked to and learned from the Ukrainians. He said they realized the \"take your time\" approach was actually \"pretty good.\"\n\nThe Ukrainians have been battling Russia's full-scale invasion for years now, but fighting in eastern Ukraine has been ongoing for over a decade. Maguire said that the Ukrainians have a \"greater understanding of what it takes to win\" and a \"sheer determination\" compared to the UK armed forces.\n\n\"That's not to say the British Army doesn't have it,\" he said. But the Ukrainians he trained had come straight from \"hardcore conventional fighting,\" bringing a level of instinctive aggression and combat readiness that he said exceeded what British troops typically display, having gone years without engaging in a high-intensity conventional fight.\n\nUkraine is fighting a very different kind of war compared to those its partners in the US and across Europe have in recent decades. It's confronting one of the world's largest militaries, with massed fires, armor, and significant airpower. This war is not the counterinsurgencies Western forces have spent years preparing for.\n\nThis large-scale war, with the return of old features like trench warfare and the introduction of new tech like drones, is a far cry from what Western militaries have been focusing on. This is a clash of old and new in a brutal, grinding attritional fight.\n\nThe UK and other allies are watching the war closely, warning that Russia may attack elsewhere in Europe and spark a wider conflict. They want to understand what a fight with Russia would require, and Maguire said Interflex is teaching Western forces while it is teaching Ukrainians.\n\nInterflex has become a two-way exchange. Many of the Ukrainians going through the program have front-line experience their instructors do not. Maguire said that Ukrainian insights — including what worked against Russia — were absorbed into Interflex's curriculum and even fed back into the UK's own training programs.\n\nHe said that training sergeants who already had \"wounds of war\" was intimidating for the Western trainers. \"There are things that they are much better than us at,\" he said.\n\nInterflex has trained more than 56,000 Ukrainians, both new recruits and experienced soldiers, with support from 13 partner nations, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Lithuania.\n\nMaguire said there were many differences between the British and Ukrainian approaches, and those differences have begun to influence British thinking.\n\nHe described the Ukrainians as being \"far more comfortable in taking tactical risks\" and said the most skilled among them are \"just able to show a bit more imagination.\" That willingness to innovate and experiment, he added, is a lesson Western forces are paying attention to as the war evolves.",

The game was a bestseller, acclaimed for its globetrotting narrative and taut, tense action – especially during its thrilling depiction of the Omaha beach landing.\n\nWhen publisher Electronic Arts made the decision to take the development of Medal of Honour in-house, Zampella and his colleague Jason West left, together with Grant Collier, and set up Infinity Ward in Los Angeles. There they created Call of Duty, a second world war shooter designed to exceed Medal of Honor’s sense of epic drama – indeed, its original development title had been Medal of Honor Killer. Critically, the game featured a range of lead characters including US, British and Russian fighters rather than giving players control of a single “super soldier”. “It’s meant to show you that no one side won the war – it was an allied effort,” Zampella said at the time.\n\nOnce again, the emphasis was on dramatic set-piece battles on a vast scale, with the player surrounded by computer-controlled allies giving the impression of being a small part of a wider campaign. “We’re all about authenticity and intensity,” Zampella said. “We’ve strived to put as many guys on screen as possible. It’s about your squad, not you as a lone gunman.”\n\nThis emphasis on teamwork and cinematic intensity would become emblematic of Call of Duty. While two sequels remained in the theatre of the second world war, for the fourth title, released in 2007, Zampella and West decided to move into the modern era. The result, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, is one of the most important and influential first-person shooters ever made.\n\nIts campaign features a group of special forces operatives, including newcomer John “Soap” MacTavish and grizzled SAS captain John Price, taking on Russian ultra-nationalists and a Middle Eastern warlord. It had imaginative and exciting missions, including All Ghillied Up, a sniper mission in the wake of the Chornobyl disaster, and the eerie Death From Above, in which players control the various weapons of a C-130 aircraft, taking out enemies on the ground who appear merely as dots on an infrared screen. Meanwhile, the game’s online multiplayer mode brought new innovations including kill-streaks, which allowed players on a winning run to call in special attacks such as airstrikes. Infinity Ward created the template for multiplayer shooters that is still used today. Call of Duty’s DNA is present in every modern hit of the genre.\n\nIn 2010, Zampella and West were fired from Infinity Ward by publisher Activision, and went on to form Respawn Entertainment, taking more than 30 Call of Duty staff with them. Under new publisher Electronic Arts, the company released Titanfall in 2014, a multiplayer-focused sci-fi shooter intended to innovate within the genre. The game emphasised the player’s freedom of movement, allowing for smooth, parkour-style navigation of obstacles and structures. Players were also able to call in and pilot giant, heavily armed mechs. As Zampella explained at the time: “It’s taking the old paradigm of these shooter games being very grounded and two-dimensional and now adding this verticality to it and making it something that’s a new experience; something that people haven’t seen before.”\n\nAfter splitting with Activision, Zampella advised several other game creatives who found themselves at odds with their publishers and were considering striking out on their own. One of them was Hideo Kojima, creator of Metal Gear Solid and, at his own studio Kojima Productions, the Death Stranding series. “When I was preparing to go independent myself, and maybe because he felt we were in similar situations, he took the time to listen to me, offered advice, and supported me in many ways,” wrote a “heartbroken” Kojima on X after Zampella’s death. “He even showed me around the studio. Even after he moved to DICE, whenever I went to Los Angeles, we would have meals together and talk about our respective futures”\n\nTitanfall’s sequel added an extraordinary single-player story to the original’s fluid online play – it is still one of the best shooter campaigns around. That series’ emphasis on smooth, seamless movement would also characterise Respawn’s entry into the battle royale genre: Apex Legends. Released with almost no pre-publicity in 2019, it would attract 10m players in its opening 72 hours and still maintains a place in the pantheon alongside Fortnite and Call of Duty: Warzone.\n\nRespawn next made two excellent single-player Star Wars games, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Survivor. Zampella’s peers have noted that working on the Star Wars franchise brought him and his colleagues at Respawn great joy.\n\nIn 2020, Electronic Arts put Zampella in charge of the Battlefield franchise, with a remit to recharge the series after the disappointing performance of Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042. Released in October, Battlefield 6 was widely praised as a return to form, especially the online multiplayer modes. It sold 7m copies in three days, the best ever opening for the series.\n\nZampella will be remembered as one of the most influential game designers of his era and a ceaseless innovator in the first-person shooter genre – and with the Star Wars Jedi series, outside it. He was someone whom you always looked forward to encountering or interviewing at games industry events, an outspoken creative who cared deeply about video games and the player’s experience.\n\n“Vince was an extraordinary person – a gamer at heart, but also a visionary executive with a rare ability to recognise talent and give people the freedom and confidence to create something truly great,” wrote Geoff Keighley on X, who runs the Game Awards and, as a former games journalist, worked on a documentary about Titanfall with Zampella. “Even when it was difficult or uncomfortable, Vince never wavered in his commitment to honesty and transparency. He believed that the truth mattered, and he was willing to share it with the world. Vince cared deeply about doing the right thing. And even while working inside large organisations, he consistently pushed to put players first – to prioritise the experience, the craft and the people who played the games. He leaves behind an incredible legacy of work … I always felt he still had his greatest one ahead of him. It’s heartbreaking that we’ll never get to play it.”",

    "title": "Taiwan needs to flood the battlefield with cheap, mobile, and survivable weapons to counter China, former senior military officer says",
    "description": "In a war with China, Taiwan could have an asymmetric advantage with a high volume of cheap and survivable weapons, a retired admiral said.",
    "fullText": "To prepare for a possible all-out war with China, Taiwan should focus on fielding substantial numbers of cheap, mobile, and survivable weapons, a former top Taiwanese defense official said.\n\nTaiwan currently faces two types of conflict — what experts and officials have referred to as China's gray-zone activities that are just below the threshold of war and the potential for a full-scale Chinese invasion. Countering both requires an array of weaponry.\n\nAt a Hudson Institute think tank event earlier this month, retired admiral and former chief of the general staff for Taiwan's defense ministry Lee Hsi-Min said Taiwan needed to prioritize the existential threat of a Chinese invasion. Gray-zone actions, such as frequent aircraft incursions, strain resources and stress assets and troops. The other could be catastrophic, as war games have shown.\n\n\"We need a large number of the distributed, mobile, survivable, lethal\" weapons, Lee argued, and those systems need to be low-cost, high-volume, and highly survivable in a fight, he added.\n\nAsymmetric warfare is a strategy that uses large numbers of inexpensive, mobile, hard-to-target systems — like drones, missiles, and dispersed units — to blunt a larger military's advantages by denying it easy targets and inflicting outsized damage. Think drones blowing up tanks in Ukraine or sinking Russian warships.\n\nLee argues that Taiwan's survival in a war against China depends on exactly this kind of strategy.\n\nTaiwan has aggressively pursued a strategy focused on weapons that fit these bills, including various types of drones, sensors, jamming, and anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles. Broader elements of increased investments in asymmetric warfare plans include how the civilian population of Taiwan is trained for a potential Chinese invasion and how the Taiwanese military would use urban warfare to hold off Chinese forces.\n\nThis doesn't mean conventional platforms and high-end weapons aren't valuable, Lee said, especially for helping Taiwan deter the everyday activities the Chinese military engages in, such as aggressive actions in the air and sea and massive exercises regularly held nearby. However, \"we need scalable\" and \"smart enough\" weapons, he said.\n\n\"If we are conducting the protracted war, sometimes the quantity means quality,\" Lee said. \"If we only have a kind of a small number of the advanced, sophisticated platform, I think we will have a big problem if China decided to attack Taiwan.\"\n\nSimilar lessons are being learned from the war in Ukraine. Soldiers, veterans, and drone makers have all said that a limited arsenal of exquisite systems isn't the right fit for a long war. The need is large volumes of cheap weapons. In warfare, sustainability is key. Overengineering and overspending simply aren't sustainable in a high-end fight.\n\nLee previously argued for asymmetric warfare and more mobile, uncrewed weapons and systems rather than buying more conventional weaponry like fighter jets and tanks in his \"Overall Defense Concept.\"\n\nIn 2020, he wrote in an article for The Diplomat that the idea is based on the premise that China will continue to see claiming Taiwan as a national and existential priority and Beijing will keep pouring money and resources into its military, which is vastly out-scaling Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan's government budgets for defense have increased substantially in recent years, and it continues to buy missiles, air defense systems, and drones from the US and other allies and partners.\n\nBut given the significant disparity between China and Taiwan's militaries and capabilities, \"Taiwan must abandon notions of a traditional war of attrition with the PLA [People’s Liberation Army],\" Lee and co-author Eric Lee, then a researcher at the Project 2049 Institute, wrote.\n\nTaiwan faces a substantially stronger adversary, and thus \"embracing an effective asymmetric defense posture and incorporating tactical asymmetric capabilities could compensate for Taiwan's disadvantage on paper and prevent the PLA from getting boots on the ground,\" they argued.\n\nAt the moment, Taiwan is leaning on a mix of capabilities. This month, the US announced its largest-ever weapons sale to Taiwan, at $11 billion. It includes High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, Army Tactical Missile Systems, Javelin missiles, howitzers, and drones.\n\nTaiwan's defense ministry said the weapons help bolster its self-defense and deterrence capabilities. China's foreign ministry said the sale violated agreements between Beijing and Washington and risked military confrontation with Taiwan.\n\nAn important piece of Taiwan's asymmetric strategy is rapid investment in domestic drone production, informed by lessons from Ukraine and collaborations with US and European firms. Taipei aims to produce 200,000 drones annually by 2030 and is investing billions into other defense systems, including a new air-defense network known as T-Dome.",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW (AP) — A car bomb killed a Russian general on Monday, the third such killing of a senior military officer in a year. Investigators said Ukraine may be behind the attack.\n\nLt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov, head of the Operational Training Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces' General Staff, died from his injuries, said Svetlana Petrenko, the spokesperson for Russia’s Investigative Committee, the nation's top criminal investigation agency.\n\n“Investigators are pursuing numerous lines of inquiry regarding the murder. One of these is that the crime was orchestrated by Ukrainian intelligence services,” Petrenko said.\n\nSince Moscow sent troops into Ukraine nearly four years ago, Russian authorities have blamed Ukraine for several assassinations of military officers and public figures in Russia. Ukraine has claimed responsibility for some of them. It has not yet commented on Monday's death.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that President Vladimir Putin had been immediately informed about Sarvarov's killing.\n\nThe Defense Ministry said that Sarvarov had previously fought in Chechnya and taken part in Moscow's military campaign in Syria.\n\nJust over a year ago, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the chief of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed by a bomb hidden on an electric scooter outside his apartment building. Kirillov's assistant also died. Ukraine’s security service claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nAn Uzbek man was quickly arrested and charged with killing Kirillov on behalf of the Ukrainian security service.\n\nPutin described Kirillov’s killing as a “major blunder” by Russia’s security agencies, noting they should learn from it and improve their efficiency.\n\nIn April, another senior Russian military officer, Lt. Gen. Yaroslav Moskalik, a deputy head of the main operational department in the General Staff, was killed by an explosive device placed in his car parked near his apartment building just outside Moscow. A suspected perpetrator was quickly arrested.\n\nDays after Moskalik's killing, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he received a report from the head of Ukraine’s foreign intelligence agency on the “liquidation” of top Russian military figures, adding that “justice inevitably comes\" although he didn't mention Moskalik's name.",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW (AP) — President Vladimir Putin emphasized Friday that Moscow’s troops were advancing across the battlefield in Ukraine and voiced confidence the Kremlin would achieve its goals militarily if Kyiv doesn't agree to Russia's conditions in peace talks.\n\nSpeaking at his tightly orchestrated annual news conference that lasted about 4 1/2 hours, Putin declared that Russian forces have “fully seized strategic initiative” and would make more gains by year's end.\n\nIn the early days of the conflict in 2022, Ukraine's forces thwarted an attempt by Russia’s larger, better-equipped army, to capture the capital of Kyiv. But the fighting soon settled into grinding battles, and Moscow's troops have made slow and steady progress over the years. Putin frequently touts this progress — even though it's not the lightning advance many expected.\n\n“Our troops are advancing all across the line of contact, faster in some areas or slower in some others, but the enemy is retreating in all sectors,” Putin said at the live news conference, which is combined with a nationwide call-in show that offers Russians across the country the opportunity to ask questions of their leader.\n\nPutin, 73, has ruled the country for 25 years and uses the event to cement his power and air his views on domestic and global affairs during a broadcast that mixes criticism of the West with promises of more social payments. Although he is sometimes asked about his personal life, he gives scant details.\n\nThis year, the news conference took place against the backdrop of a peace plan in Ukraine put forward by U.S. President Donald Trump. Despite the extensive diplomatic push, Washington’s efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nWhile the event has previously focused heavily on domestic questions — and has offered Putin a chance to expound on topics from the price of eggs to water cuts — Ukraine dominated it this year. Since it is highly choreographed, that could reflect the Kremlin’s desire to assuage the public after nearly four years of fighting.\n\nRussian demands remain unchanged\n\nPutin praised Trump's peace efforts and reaffirmed that Moscow was ready for a peaceful settlement that would address the “root causes” of the conflict, a reference to the Kremlin’s tough conditions for a deal. He said he has agreed to make “certain compromises” and “uneasy decisions” at the Alaska summit with Trump in August but didn't elaborate.\n\nHe wants all the areas in four key regions captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory. He has also insisted that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow’s forces haven’t captured yet. Kyiv has publicly rejected all these demands.\n\nThe Kremlin has also insisted that Ukraine abandon its bid to join NATO and warned that it wouldn't accept the deployment of any troops from members of the military alliance members and would view them as “legitimate target.”\n\nPutin also has repeatedly said Ukraine must limit the size of its army and give official status to the Russian language — demands he has made from the outset of the conflict.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine’s bid to join NATO if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to alliance members. But at the same time, he has emphasized that Ukraine believes NATO membership remains the best security guarantee.\n\n″The United States don’t see us in NATO, for now,\" Zelenskyy said this week. “Politicians change.”\n\nCommenting on Zelenskyy's statement that he was ready to call a presidential election if a ceasefire is established, Putin responded that Russia has held elections without demanding a truce. He said that Moscow was ready to consider the issue and could agree to halt attacks deep inside Ukraine on the election day, but noted that millions of Ukrainians living in Russia must have the right to vote. Ukraine introduced martial law banning elections, but Russia hasn't made such a move.\n\nPutin rebuffed Western claims about purported Russian plans to attack European nations as “sheer nonsense” aimed at deflecting public attention from domestic problems.\n\nHe particularly singled out NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte for his statements about the Kremlin's aggressive intentions, pointing out Trump's recently published national security strategy that doesn’t name Russia as a direct adversary. “How can you prepare NATO for a war with Russia if the main member of NATO doesn't consider us as an enemy?” Putin said.\n\nHe alleged that European elites “impudently” backed Trump's Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election and now hope the U.S. political landscape will change after the midterm elections to Congress, helping raise pressure on the White House.\n\nPutin says seizing Russian assets will backfire\n\nAs it faces grinding Russian advances across the front line and relentless attacks on its energy facilities, Ukraine desperately cash infusions from its Western allies.\n\nOn Friday, European Union leaders agreed to provide a massive interest-free loan, but they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds.\n\nThe leaders tried to reassure Belgium, where most of the frozen assets are held, that they would protect it from any retaliation from Moscow if it backed the plan, but the leaders eventually opted to borrow the money on capital markets.\n\nUsing Russian assets to help Kyiv would have amounted to “robbery,” Putin said, adding that the move would have spooked investors, “dealing not only an image blow but undermining confidence in the eurozone.”\n\nPutin says troop numbers are strong\n\nPutin said the flow of volunteer soldiers has remained strong, topping 400,000 this year. It was not possible to independently verify that claim since little is known about the recruitment effort.\n\nBut the government offers relatively high pay and extensive benefits that have helped swell troop ranks. The Kremlin says it exclusively relies on volunteers to fight in Ukraine, but some media reports and rights groups have said that military officers often coerce conscripts into signing military contracts.\n\nAsked by a soldier’s widow about slow pension payments, Putin apologized and vowed the issue would be quickly resolved — a typical exchange at the annual event, which he often uses to show his command of a wide array of subjects and his ability to solve problems.\n\nThe news conference featured questions from journalists in the Gostinny Dvor amphitheater as well as via video links from across Russia. A young man in a red bow tie who held a placard saying he wanted to get married used his question to Putin to propose to his girlfriend. Later, one of the anchors hosting the event reported that she had answered “yes,” and Putin joked about collecting money for the wedding.",

    "description": "How should a military commander respond if they determine they have received an unlawful order?",
    "fullText": "How should a military commander respond if they determine they have received an unlawful order?\n\nRequest to retire — and refrain from resigning in protest, which could be seen as a political act, or picking a fight to get fired.\n\nThat was the previously unreported guidance that Brig. Gen. Eric Widmar, the top lawyer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, gave to the country’s top general, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, in November, according to sources familiar with the discussion.\n\nCaine had just seen a video that included six Democratic lawmakers publicly urging US troops to disobey illegal orders. He asked Widmar, according to the sources, what the latest guidance was on how to determine whether an order was lawful and how a commander should reply if it is not.\n\nWidmar responded that they should consult with their legal adviser if they’re unsure, the sources said. But ultimately, if they determine that an order is illegal, they should consider requesting retirement.\n\nThe guidance sheds new light on how top military officials are thinking about an issue that has reached a fever pitch in recent weeks, as lawmakers and legal experts have repeatedly questioned the legality of the US military’s counternarcotics operations in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean including intense scrutiny of a “double-tap” strike that deliberately killed survivors on September 2.\n\nCaine is not in the chain of command. But he is closely involved in operations, including those in SOUTHCOM, and is often tasked with presenting military options to the president—more so than Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, CNN has reported.\n\nThe Joint Staff declined to comment for this story.\n\nSeveral senior officers who reportedly expressed concerns about the boat strikes, including former US Southern Command commander Adm. Alvin Holsey and Lt. Gen. Joe McGee, the former director for Strategy, Plans, and Policy on the Joint Staff, have retired early in recent months.\n\nWidmar’s advice to Caine was meant to help inform the chairman’s discussions with senior military officials should the issue come up, the sources said. The Democrats’ video had become headline news, enraging Hegseth and sparking debates across the country.\n\nA separate official familiar with military legal advice said that it is not uncommon for lawyers to urge servicemembers to consider leaving the force if they believe they’re being asked to do something they are personally uncomfortable with, but it’s typically handled on a case-by-case basis and tailored to the facts of the situation.\n\nOther current and former US officials, however, including those who have served as miliary lawyers in the Judge Advocate General corps, stressed that broadly encouraging servicemembers to quietly retire — if they’re eligible — rather than voice dissent in the face of a potentially illegal order risks perpetuating a culture of silence and lack of accountability.\n\n“A commissioned officer has every right to say, ‘this is wrong,’ and shouldn’t be expected to quietly and silently walk away just because they’re given a free pass to do so,” said a former senior defense official who left the Pentagon earlier this year.\n\nMore than a dozen senior officers have either been fired or retired early since Trump took office in January, an unusually high rate of turnover. In a speech before hundreds of general and flag officers in September, Hegseth directed officers to “do the honorable thing and resign” if they didn’t agree with his vision for the department.\n\nBut disagreeing with the direction of the military is different than viewing an order as illegal, legal experts said.\n\nDan Maurer, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and former JAG lawyer, said that the guidance, as described by CNN, appears to “misunderstand what a servicemember is supposed to do in the face of an unlawful order: disobey it if confident that the order is unlawful and attempt to persuade the order-giver to stop or modify it have failed, and report it through the chain of command.”\n\nMaurer added that “if the guidance does not explicitly advise servicemembers that they have a duty to disobey unlawful orders, the guidance is not a legitimate statement of professional military ethics and the law.”\n\nWidmar advised that an order may be unlawful if it is “patently illegal,” or something an ordinary person would recognize instinctively as a violation of domestic or international law, the sources said — the My Lai massacre in Vietnam is an oft-used example. But the guidance he provided was that an unlawful order should be met with retirement, if possible, and did not note that servicemembers have a duty to disobey unlawful orders, the sources said.\n\n“It’s a very safe recommendation in this current political environment,” said the former senior defense official. “But that doesn’t make it the right or ethical one.”\n\nExperts on civil military relations have previously pointed to retirement as a reasonable option for officers who object to a particular policy, while noting that it comes with its own costs.\n\nIn a September article that has been discussed amongst the Joint Staff and other senior military officials, Peter Feaver, a political science professor at Duke University, and Heidi Urben, a former Army intelligence officer and current associate director of Georgetown University’s security studies program, wrote that “quiet quitting”, or opting for retirement “allows officers with professionally grounded objections to leave without posing a direct challenge to civilian control.”\n\nAnd while officers shouldn’t resign in protest or pick fights, they argued, they should “speak up” and “show moral courage” when the military’s professional values and ideals are at risk.\n\nAnd they should be willing to be fired for it. “Complete silence can be corrosive to good order and discipline and signal to the force that the military’s professional values and norms are expendable,” they wrote.\n\nMaurer, the former Army officer, said the advice to retire in the face of an unlawful order also functions to “keep that person silent in perpetuity, because as a retiree he or she remains subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which criminalizes a broad range of conduct and speech that would be constitutionally protected for regular civilians.”\n\nThose constraints have been apparent as the Pentagon has launched an investigation into Sen. Mark Kelly, a retired Navy captain and one of the Democratic lawmakers seen in the video encouraging troops to disobey unlawful orders, which prompted Caine to seek the legal advice.\n\nAs questions continue to swirl around the legality of the boat strike campaign, Widmar also advised Caine that Article II of the Constitution gives the president the authority to authorize lethal force to protect the nation, unless hostilities rise to the level of a full-blown war — in which case Congressional approval is required, the sources said.\n\nWhether the president’s orders are legal to begin with, Widmar advised according to the sources, is a question only the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel can answer, due to the executive order Trump issued in February that says the president and the attorney general’s “opinions on questions of law are controlling” on all executive branch employees — to include US troops.\n\nThe Office of Legal Counsel determined in September that it is legal for Trump to order strikes on suspected drug boats because they pose an imminent threat to the United States, CNN has reported.\n\nSince September 2, the US military has killed at least 99 people across dozens of strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, arguing that those targeted were “narcoterrorists” that pose a direct threat to the United States. The Trump administration has also not provided public evidence of the presence of narcotics on the boats struck, nor their affiliation with drug cartels.\n\nLawmakers have said that Pentagon officials have acknowledged in private briefings not knowing the identities of everyone on board a vessel before striking it; instead, military officials only need to confirm that the individuals are affiliated with a cartel or criminal organization to target them.\n\nSome members of Congress, legal experts and human rights groups have argued that potential drug traffickers are civilians who should not be summarily killed but arrested—something the Coast Guard did routinely, and continues to do in the eastern Pacific, when encountering a suspected drug trafficking vessel.\n\nCNN’s Haley Britzky contributed to this report",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is promising more checks.\n\nIn an economic address to the nation that aired during prime time on Wednesday, Trump said $1,776 in bonus checks would be sent to military members for Christmas — and that tariffs are funding the payments.\n\nIt is unclear if the checks are legal and can be made without the approval of Congress, which has the constitutional power to enact a budget and appropriate funds.\n\nThe speech comes as Trump works to sell the nation on his economic plans.\n\nAccording to a NPR/PBS News Marist Poll earlier in December, Trump's economic rating hit a low this term, with only 36% saying they approve of how the president is handling the economy.\n\nIn a recent interview with Politico, Trump said he would give his economy a grade of \"A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.\"\n\nTrump is embarking on an economic tour across swing states to campaign for Republican candidates in the midterms. In his first stop in Philadelphia, he defended his tariffs and called the Democrats' criticism that his policies are driving up prices a \"hoax.\"\n\nTrump had also promised other checks in the past. He's floated such a $2,000 tariff dividend for every American below a certain income level, though congressional Republicans have balked at the idea. And he announced a $10,000 bonuse to select Transportation Security Administration employees for remaining at their posts during the 43-day federal government shutdown.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comments.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE Dec 17 - In a high-security Shenzhen laboratory, Chinese scientists have built what Washington has spent years trying to prevent: a prototype of a machine capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence, smartphones and weapons central to Western military dominance, Reuters has learned.\n\nCompleted in early 2025 and now undergoing testing, the prototype fills nearly an entire factory floor. It was built by a team of former engineers from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML who reverse-engineered the company's extreme ultraviolet lithography machines or EUVs, according to two people with knowledge of the project.\n\nEUV machines sit at the heart of a technological Cold War. They use beams of extreme ultraviolet light to etch circuits thousands of times thinner than a human hair onto silicon wafers, currently a capability monopolized by the West. The ​smaller the circuits, the more powerful the chips.\n\nChina's machine is operational and successfully generating extreme ultraviolet light, but has not yet produced working chips, the people said.\n\nIn April, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet said that China would need \"many, many years\" to develop such technology. But the existence of this prototype, reported by Reuters for the first time, suggests China may be years closer to achieving semiconductor independence than analysts anticipated.\n\nNevertheless, China still faces major ‌technical challenges, particularly in replicating the precision optical systems that Western suppliers produce.\n\nThe availability of parts from older ASML machines on secondary markets has allowed China to build a domestic prototype, with the government setting a goal of producing working chips on the prototype by 2028, according to the two people.\n\nBut those close to the project say a more realistic target is 2030, which is still years earlier than the decade that analysts believed it would take China to match the West on chips.\n\nChinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a six-year government initiative to achieve ‌semiconductor self-sufficiency, one of President Xi Jinping's highest priorities. While China's semiconductor goals have been public, the Shenzhen EUV project has been conducted in secret, according to the people.\n\nThe project falls under the country's semiconductor strategy, which state media has identified as being run by Xi Jinping confidant Ding Xuexiang, who heads the Communist Party's Central Science and Technology Commission.",

    "fullText": "BEIRUT (AP) — Qassim Hamadeh woke to the sounds of gunfire and explosions in his village of Beit Jin in southwestern Syria last month. Within hours, he had lost two sons, a daughter-in-law and his 4-year-old and 10-year-old grandsons. The five were among 13 villagers killed that day by Israeli forces.\n\nIsraeli troops had raided the village — not for the first time — seeking to capture, as they said, members of a militant group planning attacks into Israel. Israel said militants opened fire at the troops, wounding six, and that troops returned fire and brought in air support.\n\nHamadeh, like others in Beit Jin, dismissed Israel’s claims of militants operating in the village. The residents said armed villagers confronted Israeli soldiers they saw as invaders, only to be met with Israeli tank and artillery fire, followed by a drone strike. The government in Damascus called it a “massacre.”\n\nThe raid and similar recent Israeli actions inside Syria have increased tensions, frustrated locals and also scuttled chances — despite U.S. pressure — of any imminent thaw in relations between the two neighbors.\n\nAn Israeli-Syrian rapprochement seemed possible last December, after Sunni Islamist-led rebels overthrew autocratic Syrian President Bashar Assad, a close ally of Iran, Israel’s archenemy.\n\nSyria’s interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, who led the rebels who took over the country, said he has no desire for a conflict with Israel. But Israel was suspicious, mistrusting al-Sharaa because of his militant past and his group’s history of aligning with al-Qaida.\n\nIsraeli forces quickly moved to impose a new reality on the ground. They mobilized into the U.N.-mandated buffer zone in southern Syria next to the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria during the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed — a move not recognized by most of the international community.\n\nIsraeli forces erected checkpoints and military installations, including on a hilltop that overlooks wide swaths of Syria. They set up landing pads on strategic Mt. Hermon nearby. Israeli reconnaissance drones frequently fly over surrounding Syrian towns, with residents often sighting Israeli tanks and Humvee vehicles patrolling those areas.\n\nIsrael has said its presence is temporary to clear out pro-Assad remnants and militants — to protect Israel from attacks. But it has given no indication its forces would leave anytime soon. Talks between the two countries to reach a security agreement have so far yielded no result.\n\nThe events in neighboring Lebanon, which shares a border with both Israel and Syria, and the two-year war in Gaza between Israel and the militant Palestinian group Hamas have also raised concerns among Syrians that Israel plans a permanent land grab in southern Syria.\n\nIsraeli forces still have a presence in southern Lebanon, over a year since a U.S.-brokered ceasefire halted the latest Israel-Hezbollah war. That war began a day after Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, with Hezbollah firing rockets into Israel in solidarity with its ally Hamas.\n\nIsrael’s operations in Lebanon, which included bombardment across the tiny country and a ground incursion last year, have severely weakened Hezbollah.\n\nToday, Israel still controls five hilltop points in southern Lebanon, launches near-daily airstrikes against alleged Hezbollah targets and flies reconnaissance drones over the country, sometimes also carrying out overnight ground incursions.\n\nIn Gaza, where U.S. President Donald Trump’s 20-point ceasefire deal has brought about a truce between Israel and Hamas, similar buffer zones under Israeli control are planned even after Israel eventually withdraws from the more than half of the territory it still controls.\n\nAt a meeting of regional leaders and international figures earlier this month in Doha, Qatar, al-Sharaa accused Israel of using imagined threats to justify aggressive actions.\n\n“All countries support an Israeli withdrawal\" from Syria to the lines prior to Assad's ouster, he said, adding that it was the only way for both Syria and Israel to \"emerge in a state of safety.”\n\nThe new leadership in Damascus has had a multitude of challenges since ousting Assad.\n\nAl-Sharaa's government has been unable to implement a deal with local Kurdish-led authorities in northeast Syria, and large areas of southern Sweida province are now under a de facto administration led by the Druze religious minority, following sectarian clashes there in mid-July with local Bedouin clans.\n\nSyrian government forces intervened, effectively siding with the Bedouins. Hundreds of civilians, mostly Druze, were killed, many by government fighters. Over half of the roughly 1 million Druze worldwide live in Syria. Most other Druze live in Lebanon and Israel, including in the Golan Heights.\n\nIsrael, which has cast itself as a defender of the Druze, though many of them in Syria are critical of its intentions, has also made overtures to Kurds in Syria.\n\n“The Israelis here are pursuing a very dangerous strategy,” said Michael Young, Senior Editor at the Beirut-based Malcolm H. Kerr Carnegie Middle East Center.\n\nIt contradicts, he added, the positions of Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt — and even the United States — which are \"all in agreement that what has to come out of this today is a Syrian state that is unified and fairly strong,” he added.\n\nIsrael and the US at odds over Syria\n\nIn a video released from his office after visiting Israeli troops wounded in Beit Jin, barely 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the edge of the U.N. buffer zone, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel seeks a “demilitarized buffer zone from Damascus to the (U.N.) buffer zone,” including Mt. Hermon.\n\n“It is also possible to reach an agreement with the Syrians, but we will stand by our principles in any case,” Netanyahu said.\n\nHis strategy has proven to be largely unpopular with the international community, including with Washington, which has backed al-Sharaa’s efforts to consolidate his control across Syria.\n\nIsrael’s operations in southern Syria have drawn rare public criticism from Trump, who has taken al-Sharaa, once on Washington's terror list, under his wing.\n\n“It is very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria’s evolution into a prosperous State,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social after the Beit Jin clashes.\n\nSyria is also expected to be on the agenda when Netanyahu visits the U.S. and meets with Trump later this month.\n\nExperts doubt Israel will withdraw from Syria anytime soon — and the new government in Damascus has little leverage or power against Israel's much stronger military.\n\n“If you set up landing pads, then you are not here for short-term,” Issam al-Reiss, a military adviser with the Syrian research group ETANA, said of Israeli actions.\n\nHamadeh, the laborer from Beit Jin, said he can “no longer bear the situation” after losing five of his family.\n\nIsrael, he said, “strikes wherever it wants, it destroys whatever it wants, and kills whoever it wants, and no one holds it accountable.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A JetBlue flight from the small Caribbean nation of Curaçao halted its ascent to avoid colliding with a U.S. Air Force refueling tanker on Friday, and the pilot blamed the military plane for crossing his path.\n\n“We almost had a midair collision up here,” the JetBlue pilot said, according to a recording of his conversation with air traffic control. “They passed directly in our flight path. ... They don’t have their transponder turned on, it’s outrageous.”\n\nThe incident involved JetBlue Flight 1112 from Curaçao, which is just off the coast of Venezuela, en route to New York City's JFK airport. It comes as the U.S. military has stepped up its drug interdiction activities in the Caribbean and is also seeking to increase pressure on Venezuela's government.\n\n“We just had traffic pass directly in front of us within 5 miles of us — maybe 2 or 3 miles — but it was an air-to air-refueler from the United States Air Force and he was at our altitude,” the pilot said. “We had to stop our climb.” The pilot said the Air Force plane then headed into Venezuelan air space.\n\nDerek Dombrowski, a spokesman for JetBlue, said Sunday: “We have reported this incident to federal authorities and will participate in any investigation.\" He added, “Our crewmembers are trained on proper procedures for various flight situations, and we appreciate our crew for promptly reporting this situation to our leadership team.”\n\nThe Pentagon referred The Associated Press to the Air Force for comment. The Air Force didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration last month issued a warning to U.S. aircraft urging them to “exercise caution” when in Venezuelan airspace, “due to the worsening security situation and heightened military activity in or around Venezuela.”\n\nAccording to the air traffic recording, the controller responded to the pilot, “It has been outrageous with the unidentified aircraft within our air.”",

    "fullText": "GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala (AP) — Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo on Sunday said he had declared a state of emergency in two municipalities in western Guatemala a day after armed men attacked a military post and a police station, cut off roads and hijacked buses, killing at least five people.\n\nCriminal gangs are attempting to force security forces to withdraw in order to take control of the region, Arévalo said. He said his government would reinforce security.\n\nThis state of emergency, the first declared by his government, will last for 15 days in the municipalities of Nahuala and Santa Catarina Ixtahuacan in the department of Solola.\n\n“We are at a critical moment for the department of Solola and the security of the country,” Arévalo said, accompanied Interior Minister Marco Villeda and José Giovanni Martínez Milán, the acting Defense Minister and head of General Staff.\n\nArévalo showed videos and photos from Saturday’s events, in which armed men - some dressed in camouflage or military uniforms, wearing helmets and bulletproof vests and carrying high-caliber weapons - can be seen shooting or taking cover just meters away from a busy main road.\n\nThe criminal groups are linked to extortion and drug trafficking and pose a threat to the local communities, Arévalo said.\n\n“The communities are not alone,” he said.\n\nInterior Minister Marco Villeda said that five people had died. On Saturday, the director of the National Civil Police, David Botero, said that six people had died, including a soldier.\n\nThe incidents are believed to have started last Thursday when armed men attacked the military post, leaving four people wounded at that time.\n\nThe two municipalities have had disputes for several decades over water sources and local roads they both claim as their own. These disputes have led to dozens of deaths.\n\n“In this case, there was no attack between the communities. This was an attack on the military post, intentionally and specifically,” Arévalo said.\n\nThe state of emergency limits the rights to open-air meetings, public demonstrations and events. It allows for the dissolution by force of any unauthorized gatherings, groups, or public demonstrations, particularly those involving weapons or violent acts.\n\nIt also limits the right to protests that affect free movement or public services, which can be forcibly dissolved, and restricts the right to carry weapons.",

According to the Palestinian Foreign Ministry, 159 countries have recognized Palestine. The vast majority of the international community believes that a two-state solution is the only way to end decades of conflict.\n\nNetanyahu's government has said the international push for a Palestinian state rewards Hamas.\n\nHere are some global reactions to the Australia shooting:\n\nIran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei condemned the attack: “Terrorism and the killing of people, wherever they occur, are unacceptable and must be condemned.”\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said Washington strongly condemned the attack and that “Antisemitism has no place in this world.”\n\nKing Charles III said he was “appalled and saddened.” He also leads the Commonwealth, and the office of Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Sunday said Herzog had reached out to the king in September warning of an “epidemic of antisemitism” in three Commonwealth countries: Britain, Canada and Australia.\n\nMeanwhile, police in London said they would step up security at Jewish sites.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the attack “has left me speechless” and added that “this is an attack on our shared values. We must stop this antisemitism, here in Germany and worldwide.”\n\nSecretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was horrified and that “My heart is with the Jewish community worldwide on this first day of Hannukah, a festival celebrating the miracle of peace and light vanquishing darkness.”\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the “ghastly terrorist attack” and said that “we stand in solidarity with the people of Australia in this hour of grief.”\n\nThe organization's president, Ronald Lauder, said that “No community should ever fear ​coming together to celebrate its faith, traditions, or identity,” adding: “Make no mistake, this will not break us.\"\n\n\"I’m surrounded by antisemitic graffiti constantly. I think for our community in the east (of Sydney), and as a Christian, I just want to declare I stand with the people of Israel,” Anglican pastor Matt Graham told Australian Broadcasting Corp. He said he had been conducting a service at the nearby Bondi Anglican Church when panicked people began entering to take shelter.",

Alvin Holsey, the commander of US Southern Command who reportedly clashed with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over the legality of the US military strikes in the Caribbean, officially retired on Friday in a ceremony in Floria where he handed the reigns of the command to his deputy.",
    "fullText": "Adm. Alvin Holsey, the commander of US Southern Command who reportedly clashed with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over the legality of US military strikes in the Caribbean, officially retired on Friday in a ceremony in Florida where he handed the reins of the command to his deputy.\n\nHolsey thanked his wife, his sons — one of whom is a currently deployed Naval aviator — and others who attended the event.\n\n“I’m reminded that in life, we don’t remember days, we remember moments. Those we lead don’t follow titles, they follow courage, and they remember the moments and how you made them feel,” Holsey said. “They remember those who listen and treated them with dignity and respect.”\n\nHolsey will be replaced by Air Force Lt. Gen. Evan Pettus, who has been serving as his deputy at Southern Command since Holsey was elevated to the role last year.\n\nSouthern Command is responsible for managing US military operations in most of Latin America and the Caribbean Sea.\n\nHolsey’s retirement was announced in October by Hegseth, less than a year into Holsey’s command and just days after the US conducted its fifth attack on an alleged drug trafficking boat off the coast of Venezuela. Hegseth and Holsey had disagreements over US operations in the region, two sources familiar with the matter previously told CNN.\n\nHegseth felt Holsey was not moving aggressively enough to combat drug traffickers in the Southern Command area of operations, CNN has reported, while Southern Command officials were concerned about the legality of the strikes.\n\nThose issues came to a head in an October 6 meeting at the Pentagon between Holsey, Hegseth, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine. One of the sources familiar with the situation said Holsey offered to leave his post during that meeting, CNN has reported, but the offer was tabled.\n\nThe legality of the US strikes against alleged drug boats has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks as lawmakers have demanded answers about a follow-on strike carried out in September that killed two survivors of an initial attack.\n\nCaine, who presided over Friday’s ceremony, called Holsey a “quiet professional” and “an extraordinary human who’s always led with your heart, your head, and gone all-in every single day of your service.”\n\n“You’ve made an incredible difference to our joint force. You made an incredible difference here in this headquarters. You make an incredible difference to this nation…we will always be grateful for the gift of a great example for you and your family’s service and sacrifice, and for the way that you’ve approached the professional wisdom of leadership and service,” Cain said. “The impact that you’ve had will last for a long, long time.”\n\nHolsey’s successor, Pettus, is an Air Force Academy graduate and a pilot of the F-15e and A-10 with more than 2,700 flight hours, according to his official biography. Prior to joining Southern Command, Pettus led the 12th Air Force (Air Forces Southern) stationed out of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona. Air Forces Southern provides “air, space and cyberspace capabilities throughout Latin America and the Caribbean,” Pettus’ bio says.\n\nPettus has been at Southern Command working as Holsey’s deputy during the alleged drug boat strike campaign that started in September at a time that the US has also been massing personnel and assets in the region and conducting training missions off the coast of Venezuela, even reopening a military base in Puerto Rico that had been closed for decades.\n\nCNN has reported that a significant percentage of all deployed US Naval assets are now in the theater, including the Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group, the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group, and the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit. Those groups amount to roughly 15,000 US troops, multiple guided-missile destroyers, an attack submarine, a special operations ship, and various fighter aircraft.\n\nThe relinquishment of Holsey’s command also comes just days after the US seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela; President Donald Trump said only that the vessel was seized for “very good reason,” in comments to reporters Wednesday. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a social media post announcing the seizure that the tanker had been sanctioned by the US for years “due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.",

    "fullText": "DORAL, Fla. (AP) — A U.S. Navy admiral who oversees military operations in Latin America handed off command responsibilities Friday as scrutiny increases over the Trump administration's deadly strikes on alleged drug boats in the region.\n\nAdm. Alvin Holsey has retired one year into a posting that typically lasts three to four years and transferred leadership duties to his top military deputy, Air Force Lt. Gen. Evan Pettus, during a ceremony at U.S. Southern Command headquarters near Miami.\n\nIn farewell remarks, Holsey did not mention the military operations or the reasons for his early retirement. But he urged his successor to uphold longstanding partnerships in the region by standing firmly behind the shared values of democracy and support for the rule of law.\n\n“To be a trusted partner, we must be credible, present and engaged,” Holsey said.\n\nHolsey’s shock retirement was announced by the Pentagon in October, over a month into the Trump administration’s strikes on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean that have killed at least 87 people. With the campaign facing growing scrutiny by Congress, Holsey briefed key lawmakers earlier this week.\n\nLong-term replacement for Holsey hasn't yet been named\n\nThe ceremony Friday was more subdued than past retirements, held outdoors amid a small crowd of mostly Southern Command staff and without Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, because President Donald Trump has yet to nominate Holsey’s replacement.\n\nGen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made no mention of the military operations in Latin America as he thanked Holsey for his 37 years of service. Caine referred to Holsey as a “stoic” leader and “quiet professional” who always leads with his heart and head.\n\n“It’s never been about you, it’s been about people, it’s been about others,” Caine said. “You’ve never said ‘I’ in all the conversations we’ve had. You’ve always said ‘we.’ … The impact you’ve had will last for a long time.”\n\nHolsey is departing as Congress is scrutinizing the boat attacks, including one that killed two survivors clinging to the wreckage of an initial strike. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Hegseth and other top officials have given classified briefings on Capitol Hill this week.\n\nHolsey also spoke this week to key lawmakers overseeing the U.S. military by classified video call. Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said afterward that Holsey answered senators’ questions but that “there are still many questions to be answered.” Reed later added that Holsey did not give a reason for his retirement other than saying it was a personal decision.\n\nExperts in the rules of warfare, human rights groups and even some of Trump's allies in Congress have questioned the legality of the attacks on those accused of ferrying drugs. For decades, they were arrested at sea by the Coast Guard and brought to the U.S. for criminal prosecution.\n\nThe 22 known strikes against alleged drug-smuggling vessels are being supported by a giant flotilla of U.S. warships, attack helicopters, thousands of troops and even the nation's most advanced aircraft carrier.\n\nTrump's Republican administration has defended its aggressive tactics, designating several drug cartels in Latin America as foreign terrorist organizations and declaring that the U.S. is in armed conflict with those criminal organizations, relying on a legal argument that gained traction after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nThe campaign has ramped up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who has been charged with narcoterrorism in the U.S. In a sharp escalation Wednesday, U.S. forces seized a sanctioned oil tanker that the Trump administration has accused of smuggling illicit crude. Sale of that oil on global energy markets is critical to Maduro’s grip on power.\n\nMaduro has insisted the real purpose of the U.S. military operations is to force him from office.\n\nHolsey’s departure is the latest in a long line of sudden retirements and firings that have befallen the military’s top ranks since Hegseth took charge of the Pentagon.\n\nA native of rural Fort Valley, Georgia, whose father and several uncles served in Vietnam, Holsey relinquished his command to Pettus to a soulful rendition of “Midnight Train to Georgia.”\n\nPettus, a fighter jet pilot with combat experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, had been serving as Holsey’s top deputy since late 2024. However, it’s unclear how long the Arkansas native will remain in the job. Whomever Trump nominates must be confirmed by the Senate.",

    "fullText": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — The United States is using its economic power to “assert its will\" and threaten military force against friend and foe alike, a Danish intelligence agency said in a new report.\n\nThe Danish Defense Intelligence Service, in its latest annual assessment, said Washington's greater assertiveness under the Trump administration also comes as China and Russia seek to diminish Western, especially American, influence.\n\nPerhaps most sensitive to Denmark — a NATO and European Union member country, and a U.S. ally — is growing competition between those great powers in the Arctic. U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed a desire to see Greenland, a semiautonomous and mineral-rich territory of Denmark, become part of the United States, a move opposed by Russia and much of Europe.\n\n“The strategic importance of the Arctic is rising as the conflict between Russia and the West intensifies, and the growing security and strategic focus on the Arctic by the United States will further accelerate these developments,” said the report, published Wednesday.\n\nThe assessment also follows the release last week of a new Trump administration national security strategy that depicts European allies as weak and aims to reassert America’s dominance in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said Russia is worried about NATO’s activities in the Arctic and will respond by strengthening its military capability in the polar region.\n\nThe findings and analyses in the report echo a string of recent concerns, notably in Western Europe, about an increasingly go-it-alone approach by the United States, which under Trump's second term has favored bilateral deals and partnerships at the expense of multilateral alliances like NATO.\n\n“For many countries outside the West, it has become a viable option to forge strategic agreements with China rather than the United States,” read the report, which was written in Danish. “China and Russia, together with other like-minded states, are seeking to reduce Western – and particularly US – global influence.”\n\n“At the same time, uncertainty has grown over how the United States will prioritize its resources in the future,” it added. “This gives regional powers greater room for maneuver, enabling them to choose between the United States and China or to strike a balance between the two.”\n\nThe Trump administration has raised concerns about respect for international law with its series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean — part of a stepped-up pressure campaign against President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela.\n\nTrump has also refused to rule out military force in Greenland, where the United States already has a military base.\n\n“The United States is leveraging economic power, including threats of high tariffs, to assert its will, and the possibility of employing military force – even against allies – is no longer ruled out,” the report said.",

Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty touched on this year's installment of the military shooter series, and although he didn't address sales numbers directly, he did acknowledge the hardships of the franchise's annual model.\nSpeaking to Variety, Booty said that \"shipping a major franchise like clockwork every year is a really difficult task, and I’m really proud of what the team did to move the franchise forward in that way.\"\nA new Call of Duty game has been released every year since the franchise's beginning in 2003, and it doesn't appear that Xbox-owned publisher Activision will stop this pattern any time soon. The only change to the release model is that the series will no longer release back-to-back installments of the same subseries, as Modern Warfare and Black Ops have both done.",

    "fullText": "The high seas are increasingly dangerous territory for autocratic petrostates. On Wednesday, US military and law enforcement agents seized an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast. The ship had reportedly spent at least the past two years ferrying sanctioned crude from Iran and Venezuela, and using transponder tricks to obscure its location.\n\nNabbing the ship marks a drastic escalation in US President Donald Trump’s pressure campaign against Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, one that will be especially painful for Maduro’s deeply oil-reliant budget and that is probably on firmer legal footing than the recent spate of missile strikes on purported drug boats (and that could sting China, the main buyer of Venezuelan oil). The fate of the oil itself is less clear: “We keep it, I guess,” Trump said, which the Venezuelan government called “blatant theft.”\n\nThe bigger picture is that seaborne oil trade is quickly turning into the most exposed Achilles’ heel at the center of major global conflicts. The European Union and G7 are considering aggressive new financial measures against Russia’s “shadow fleet,” which now handles two-thirds of the country’s oil exports. Ukraine is acting more decisively on its own, with a recent string of naval drone attacks that hit five Russian oil vessels in far-flung corners of the globe over 13 days.\n\nIn the past, when Western governments sanctioned an adversary’s oil exports, they were loath to take “kinetic” action against sanction-dodging ships. Shadow vessels could be hard to track; interceptions risk oil spills or violations of international law; and political leaders are always fearful that attempts to squeeze an adversary’s oil revenue can backfire by raising energy prices at home.\n\nBut now, satellite imagery and other open-source data have made it much harder to hide on the high seas. And oil prices are relatively low amidst an oversupplied global market, reducing the risk of significant price blowback. In fact, that market glut is most visible at sea: The total number of barrels currently on ships is 24% higher than the average of the last decade, and the number of sanctioned barrels has leapt 82% in the past year. The seas are awash, in other words, in juicy oil targets.\n\nWould Russia or Venezuela risk a direct engagement with the US Navy in defense of commercial oil vessels? The Pentagon seems to find that unlikely. Still, there’s a lesson here about the security risks faced by both buyers and sellers of seaborne fossil fuels — one that applies to the US as much as its adversaries.",

    "fullText": "World War II wasn’t just fought by men and women on the front lines, it was also defined by the machines they rode, drove, and sailed into history. From towering cannons that shook the earth to massive battleships that seemed unsinkable, these vehicles weren’t just tools of war, they were icons of an era.\n\nThey carried with them the hopes of nations, the fears of enemies, and the awe of anyone who ever laid eyes on them. Today, long after their thunder has faded, these machines remain unforgettable, living on in movies, documentaries, and the collective memory of a world that witnessed the most intense conflict in history.\n\nWe’ve gathered a dozen of the most iconic, the ones that left the biggest dents not just in the battlefield, but in the imagination of generations.\n\nDuring World War II, the Germans unveiled one of the most jaw-dropping superweapons ever constructed: the Schwerer Gustav. This massive railway gun wasn’t just a piece of artillery; it was a rolling symbol of intimidation and ambition. Imagine a weapon so large it had to be transported in pieces, assembled on specially laid tracks, and required a small army of men just to operate.\n\nIts sheer presence turned heads wherever it was moved, a physical reminder of how far nations were willing to push the limits of engineering in the pursuit of victory. The Gustav wasn’t practical in the traditional sense; it was slow to move, exposed to air attack, and required enormous logistical support, but it did manage to fire upon fortified positions with shells the size of small cars. When it thundered, the earth shook, and even those far from the battlefield could feel its echo.\n\nAccording to History.com, the Japanese battleship Yamato has become a near-legend of World War II, a floating fortress that seemed almost too big to be real. Launched as the pride of the Imperial Japanese Navy, Yamato was designed to outgun anything that floated, carrying massive guns that could rain destruction over distances unimaginable for most ships of the time.\n\nBut its story is just as much about symbolism as it is about firepower. Japan built Yamato as a statement, a declaration that it would never be overshadowed on the high seas. When it sailed, it carried the weight of a nation’s pride, and its silhouette on the horizon inspired awe and dread in equal measure. Life aboard the ship was like living inside a steel city, and sailors felt both honored and burdened to serve on what was considered the ultimate warship. Yet Yamato’s greatness was undercut by the changing tides of war, where air power proved deadlier than naval guns.\n\nThe German battleship Bismarck was the terror of the Atlantic, a warship that embodied Germany’s determination to dominate the seas. When it set out, Allied sailors whispered its name with dread, knowing its guns could sink even the strongest battleships.\n\nIts most infamous moment came when it destroyed HMS Hood, Britain’s pride, in a clash that shocked the world. But this triumph only fueled the Allies’ obsession with bringing Bismarck down, sparking one of the most relentless hunts in naval history. The chase ended with the Bismarck crippled and sunk, a dramatic downfall that proved even legends could be cornered.\n\nThe Tiger I was more than just a tank; it was a monster of steel that rolled into battle like something out of a nightmare. German crews felt nearly unstoppable inside their armor, and Allied soldiers often spoke of Tigers with a mix of fear and respect.\n\nAlthough not the most numerous tank of the war, it became a symbol of German engineering and battlefield dominance. Its reputation was so fearsome that sometimes troops believed Tigers were present even when they weren’t. Stories of its invincibility spread faster than the tanks themselves, creating an aura that magnified its true impact.\n\nThe American Sherman tank wasn’t the most powerful or flashy, but it became the backbone of Allied ground forces. What made the Sherman iconic wasn’t unmatched strength, but its reliability and sheer numbers.\n\nThese tanks rolled across Europe in endless waves, a constant presence that wore down German defenses. Soldiers trusted the Sherman to get them where they needed to go, even if it wasn’t invincible against heavier armor. Its role in supporting infantry and keeping pressure on enemy positions was vital. The Sherman also carried symbolic weight as a machine that embodied America’s industrial might, producing vehicles faster than the enemy could destroy them.\n\nThe Soviet T-34 is often hailed as the tank that saved Russia, a machine built for resilience above all else. It was designed to fight in mud, snow, and harsh conditions that would have crippled more delicate machines.\n\nSoviet crews praised its toughness and mobility, and German soldiers learned to fear its sudden appearances. Unlike the Tigers, the T-34 wasn’t about prestige, it was about practicality and overwhelming numbers. It became the spearhead of massive offensives, pushing the Red Army deeper into enemy lines. Its silhouette is instantly recognizable, embodying the Soviet determination to endure and strike back.\n\nNicknamed “The Big E,” the USS Enterprise was the heart of the U.S. Navy’s carrier force during World War II. It fought in nearly every major battle in the Pacific, becoming a constant thorn in Japan’s side.\n\nSailors considered it a lucky ship, as it survived countless close calls and kept coming back stronger. Its aircraft struck decisive blows at battles like Midway, proving the aircraft carrier had replaced the battleship as the true ruler of the seas. Enterprise carried not just planes, but the morale of the Navy itself, a floating symbol of American resilience.\n\nThe British Lancaster bomber was the heavy hitter of the Royal Air Force, a night predator that struck deep into enemy territory. With its long wings and bomb bays, it could carry massive payloads and was trusted for the most dangerous missions.\n\nCrews often flew under moonlight and cloud cover, facing flak and fighters while keeping steady toward their targets. Perhaps its most famous mission was the daring “Dambusters” raid, which became a legend of ingenuity and courage. For many, the Lancaster represented Britain’s determination to hit back despite heavy losses.\n\nThe humble Jeep may not look as glamorous as a battleship or bomber, but it became one of the most beloved vehicles of the war. It was everywhere, carrying troops, hauling supplies, even serving as makeshift ambulances.\n\nSoldiers adored it for its toughness and simplicity, able to keep running through mud, sand, and rough terrain. The Jeep wasn’t about firepower, but about mobility, giving armies the ability to move fast and adapt. Its squat, boxy shape became instantly recognizable wherever Allied forces went.\n\nWhile not as intimidating as the Tiger, the Panzer IV was the true workhorse of Germany’s armored divisions. It fought in every theater of the war, proving versatile and adaptable to countless roles.\n\nGerman commanders relied on it heavily, knowing they could field it in large numbers. Its reputation wasn’t built on invincibility, but on consistency; it was always there, pushing the front lines forward. For Allied troops, facing a Panzer IV meant dealing with a determined and capable opponent.\n\nFew aircraft of World War II were as infamous as the Stuka dive bomber, its screaming sirens designed to terrify those below. German propaganda made the Stuka into a symbol of Blitzkrieg, a machine that delivered both destruction and dread.\n\nIts steep dive attacks were precise and shocking, leaving soldiers scrambling for cover. Early in the war, it seemed unstoppable, carving paths for advancing German forces. But as the skies grew more dangerous with Allied fighters, the Stuka became vulnerable.\n\nThe Soviet Katyusha rocket launcher was nicknamed “Stalin’s Organ” for the howling sound it made when firing. Mounted on trucks, it unleashed barrages of rockets that blanketed enemy positions in chaos.\n\nSoldiers described the experience as terrifying, both for those launching and those receiving the fire. Unlike traditional artillery, Katyushas could quickly move, strike, and vanish before counterattacks. Their power wasn’t in precision but in overwhelming force that rattled entire sectors.\n\nThe war ended generations ago, but the silhouettes of these machines are still etched in our minds. Whether it was the terrifying scream of a Stuka diving, the steady rumble of a Sherman column, or the towering presence of a battleship at sea, each one told a story larger than life.\n\nThese vehicles were characters in the grand part of history, and their stories remind us how innovation, ambition, and courage collided in a time of global upheaval. Today, we look back not to glorify war, but to understand how these machines became lasting legends. They are reminders of humanity’s power to build, to endure, and to remember. The steel has rusted, but the legends live on.",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — Almost four years into Russia’s full-scale war on Ukraine, European Union leaders have committed to funding Kyiv’s economic and military needs for the next two years, one way or another. Ukraine is desperate and needs the money by early 2026.\n\nAt a summit next week, the 27 EU leaders will weigh whether to use tens of billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets held in Europe to help meet Ukraine’s requirements, which the International Monetary Fund puts at 135 billion euros ($157 billion).\n\nSuch a move has never been done before, and it comes with risks. The European Central Bank has warned that if Europeans appear willing to grab other countries' money, it could undermine confidence in the euro currency. Some member nations are also concerned about inviting retaliation from Russia.\n\nBelgium, where most of the assets are held, is the main opponent of the plan. It’s fearful that Russia will strike back, either through the courts or in more nefarious ways. A series of drone incidents near airports and military bases last month suggested that the Kremlin was already doing so, but those responsible were never publicly identified.\n\nEuropean Council President Antonio Costa, who will chair the Dec. 18 summit, has insisted that the leaders should not leave EU headquarters in Brussels until they have reached a decision.\n\nEU leaders froze the money, most of it in Russian Central Bank assets, over the war that Putin launched in February 2022. Moscow has described the scheme as “theft.”\n\nTwo plans have emerged. The first would be a “reparations loan” that would use the Russian assets until Moscow agrees to pay for the damage inflicted on Ukraine. Few think Russian President Vladimir Putin will ever agree to pay reparations.\n\nPlan B would be for the EU to borrow the money on financial markets, much as the bloc did to fund a massive loan plan to revive European economies after the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMany of Europe’s major economies are cash strapped and mired in debt. But Russia’s war on Ukraine poses an existential threat to the bloc. Intelligence assessments suggest that Putin could launch a war elsewhere in three to five years should he defeat Ukraine.\n\nThe assets make up a substantial pot of potentially ready-to-use cash.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU’s executive branch, estimates that 210 billion ($244 billion) euros worth of frozen assets are currently held in Europe. The vast majority — around 193 billion euros ($225 billion) at the end of September — are held in the Belgian financial clearinghouse known as Euroclear.\n\nThere are political advantages too. Should the EU choose to use the assets, only “a qualified majority” of countries — around a two-thirds majority — would be required for a green light. Borrowing on financial markets would have to be endorsed by all, meaning that even a single no vote would sink the idea.\n\nOver the last year, Hungary has blocked EU support for Ukraine at almost every turn. The government in Slovakia is starting to dig in its heels as well. A new and stridently nationalist leader in the Czech Republic could further complicate the decision.\n\nAvoiding a veto is in the interest of the vast majority of member countries.\n\nDetails of the reparations loan\n\nUnveiling her plan on Dec. 4, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU would cover two-thirds of Ukraine’s needs for 2026 and 2027, for a total of 90 billion euros ($105 billion). International partners would fill the gap.\n\nDue to EU sanctions on Russia’s assets, cash balances have accumulated at Euroclear. They’ve generated interest — some 3.9 billion euros ($4.5 billion) this year, Euroclear says — which is already being used to fund a Group of Seven loan plan for Ukraine.\n\nUnder the new plan, some of the cash would be transferred to an EU debt instrument. Ukraine would owe the EU the money but would repay only after the bloc’s sanctions are lifted and after Russia agrees to pay war reparations.\n\nThe commission insists that there is no “theft,” as Russia has claimed, because the right of the Russian Central Bank to make a claim on its money and Euroclear’s duty to repay will remain intact.\n\nOnce Putin pays war reparations, Ukraine would repay the EU, the EU would repay Euroclear, and Euroclear would repay the Russian Central Bank.\n\nImportantly for Belgium, the plan contains safeguards to ensure that the risks would be shared by its partners. Other EU countries would offer to guarantee the loan if something went wrong. Germany has already signaled that it would do so.\n\nBut the Belgian government has not been assuaged. Even before the commission's reparations loan plan was made public, Foreign Minister Maxime Prévot said that it “entails consequential economic, financial and legal risks.”\n\nPrévot said Belgium — a strong backer of Ukraine that has provided military and financial support — feels that its concerns are not being heard by its EU partners.\n\n“We are not seeking to antagonize our partners or Ukraine. We are simply seeking to avoid potential disastrous consequences for a member state that is being asked to show solidarity without being offered the same solidarity in return,” he said.\n\nIn an interview with Belgian public broadcaster RTBF last week, Euroclear CEO Valerie Urbain also said that court action could not be ruled out should the EU oblige the clearinghouse to transfer its Russian assets.",

    "description": "The USS Arizona was one of the most historically significant warships in military history. The Navy just removed 150 tons of concrete from its remains.",
    "fullText": "After over 80 years in the water, the U.S. Navy has removed more than 150 tons of aging concrete mooring platforms from the USS Arizona. This move comes as the Navy and the Pearl Harbor National Memorial finish their months-long effort to protect and preserve the major U.S. Navy ship sunk during World War II. After years of planning, a team started this project in September 2025, taking the last of the two platforms from the water about a month later. Removing these concrete platforms was effectively the final step. Today, only small sections remain to avoid disturbing one of the most historically significant warships in military history.\n\nThe process involved using a crane barge and diamond wire saw to cut and lift concrete segments from the sunken battleship. Navy Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit 1 led the work alongside help from federal contractors. This was no small feat, as the team's schedule often involved many 12-to-14-hour days to get the job done on schedule.\n\nWhy now? Well, officials said the project addressed some long-standing concerns that the massive structures might eventually collapse through the USS Arizona's deteriorating decks. The concrete platforms were first installed after the attack at Pearl Harbor to support the salvage of guns and munitions. There they've remained ever since.\n\nSince it was an underwater job, several environmentalists were involved in the uninstallation process. Experts in marine resources, historic preservation, water quality, and water safety were on standby for continuous support. That way, the platforms could be removed without harming the surrounding harbor ecosystem, the memorial, or any of the people working to remove them in the first place.\n\nThe USS Arizona Memorial, managed by the National Park Service since 1980, spans the midsection of the sunken battleship and is accessible only by boat. Built in 1962, it serves as both a national monument and the final resting place for those hundreds of sailors and Marines who died aboard the ship — not to mention any survivors who later chose to have their ashes interred there. This major undertaking helps make sure the memorial is no longer under threat of damage, allowing future generations to still visit the U.S. battleship for years to come.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "description": "On Monday, Israel's military took journalists into Rafah — the city at Gaza's southernmost point that troops seized last year and largely flattened — as the 2-month-old Israel-Hamas ceasefire reaches a critical point.  Israel has banned international journalists from entering Gaza since the war began more than two years ago, except for rare, brief visits supervised by the military, such as this one.",
    "fullText": "RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — One by one, the soldiers squeezed through a narrow entrance to a tunnel in southern Gaza. Inside a dark hallway, some bowed their heads to avoid hitting the low ceiling, while watching their step as they walked over or around jagged concrete, crushed plastic bottles and tattered mattresses.\n\nOn Monday, Israel's military took journalists into Rafah — the city at Gaza's southernmost point that troops seized last year and largely flattened — as the 2-month-old Israel-Hamas ceasefire reaches a critical point. Israel has banned international journalists from entering Gaza since the war began more than two years ago, except for rare, brief visits supervised by the military, such as this one.\n\nSoldiers escorted journalists inside a tunnel, which they said was one of Hamas' most significant and complex underground routes, connecting cities in the embattled territory and used by top Hamas commanders. Israel said Hamas had kept the body of a hostage in the underground passage: Hadar Goldin, a 23-year-old soldier who was killed in Gaza more than a decade ago and whose remains had been held there.\n\nHamas returned Goldin's body last month as part of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in the war triggered by the militants' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and hundreds taken hostage. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 70,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which operates under the Hamas-run government. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but says roughly half the dead have been women and children.\n\nIsrael and Hamas are on the cusp of finishing the first phase of the truce, which mandated the return of all hostages, living and dead, in exchange for Palestinians held by Israel. The body of just one more hostage remains to be returned.\n\nMediators warn the second phase will be far more challenging since it includes thornier issues, such as disarming Hamas and Israel’s withdrawal from the strip. Israel currently controls more than half of Gaza.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to travel to Washington this month to discuss those next steps with U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nPiles of rubble line Rafah's roads\n\nLast year, Israel launched a major operation in Rafah, where many Palestinians had sought refuge from offensives elsewhere. Heavy fighting left much of the city in ruins and displaced nearly one million Palestinians. This year, when the military largely had control of the city, it systematically demolished most of the buildings that remained standing, according to satellite photos.\n\nTroops also took control of and shut the vital Rafah crossing, Gaza’s only gateway to the outside world that was not controlled by Israel.\n\nIsrael said Rafah was Hamas’ last major stronghold and key to dismantling the group’s military capabilities, a major war aim.\n\nOn the drive around Rafah on Monday, towers of mangled concrete, wires and twisted metal lined the roads, with few buildings still standing and none unscathed. Remnants of people's lives were scattered the ground: a foam mattress, towels and a book explaining the Quran.\n\nLast week, Israel said it was ready to reopen the Rafah crossing but only for people to leave the strip. Egypt and many Palestinians fear that once people leave, they won't be allowed to return. They say Israel is obligated to open the crossing in both directions.\n\nIsrael has said that entry into Gaza would not be permitted until Israel receives all hostages remaining in the strip.\n\nThe tunnel that journalists were escorted through runs beneath what was once a densely populated residential neighborhood, under a United Nations compound and mosques. Today, Rafah is a ghost town. Underground, journalists picked their way around dangling cables and uneven concrete slabs covered in sand.\n\nThe army says the tunnel is more than 7 kilometers (4 miles) long and up to 25 meters (82 feet) deep and was used for storing weapons as well as long-term stays. It said top Hamas commanders were there during the war, including Mohammed Sinwar — who was believed to have run Hamas’ armed wing and was the younger brother of Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who helped mastermind the Oct. 7 attack. Israel has said it has killed both of them.\n\n“What we see right here is a perfect example of what Hamas did with all the money and the equipment that was brought into Gaza throughout the years,\" said Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani. \"Hamas took it and built an incredible city underground for the purposes of terror and holding bodies of hostages.”\n\nIsrael has long accused Hamas of siphoning off money for military purposes. While Hamas says the Palestinians are an occupied people and have a right to resist, the group also has a civilian arm and ran a government that provided services such as health care, a police force and education.\n\nThe army hasn’t decided what to do with the tunnel. It could seal it with concrete, explode it or hold it for intelligence purposes among other options.\n\nSince the ceasefire began, three soldiers have been killed in clashes with about 200 Hamas militants that Israeli and Egyptian officials say remain underground in Israeli-held territory.\n\nHamas has said communication with its remaining units in Rafah has been cut off for months and that it was not responsible for any incidents occurring in those areas.\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas have accused each other of repeated violations of the deal during the first phase. Israel has accused Hamas of dragging out the hostage returns, while Palestinian health officials say over 370 Palestinians have been killed in continued Israeli strikes since the ceasefire took effect.\n\nEditor's Note: This article was submitted for review by Israel’s military censor, which made no changes.",

Asim Munir made his remarks at his headquarters in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, where he received a guard of honor from all three branches of the military, marking the launch of Pakistan’s new joint military command.\n\nHis appointment was confirmed last week in what officials said would improve coordination among the army, navy and air force, amid shifting regional security dynamics.\n\nMunir said that the new Defence Forces Headquarters marks a historic step, creating a unified tri-services command to boost coordination across land, air, sea, cybersecurity and information domains amid rising security threats, according to a military statement.\n\nMunir told officers that a “clear message” had been delivered to the Taliban government in Kabul: it must decide between Pakistan and “Fitna al-Khawarij,” a term authorities use for the outlawed Pakistani Taliban, known a s Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP.\n\nThe TTP, though separate, is closely aligned with the Afghan Taliban and has been emboldened since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Kabul.\n\nRelations between the two neighbors have deteriorated since October, when several days of border clashes killed dozens of soldiers, civilians and suspected militants and wounded hundreds more. The violence followed Oct. 9 explosions in Kabul that Taliban authorities blamed on Pakistan. A Qatar-mediated ceasefire has largely held since October, though they failed to reach an agreement in November, despite holding three rounds of talks in Istanbul.\n\nMunir has risen to prominence since earlier this year, when Pakistan said it repelled India in a four-day conflict. The two nuclear-armed rivals exchanged tit-for-tat strikes in May after India targeted militants inside Pakistan, accusing them of involvement in the massacre of 26 tourists in India-controlled Kashmir.\n\nThe confrontation eased only after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that India and Pakistan had agreed to a “full and immediate ceasefire.”\n\nMunir said the operations during the conflict have become a “textbook example” of future warfare. He also presented awards to Pakistan navy and air force personnel for their roles in the fighting.\n\nMunir said that “India must remain under no illusion that Pakistan’s next response will be even swifter and more severe.” He said that Pakistan is a peace-loving country, “but no one will be allowed to test its resolve regarding sovereignty, territorial integrity, peace or stability.”\n\nPakistan and India have a long history of bitter relations and have fought three of their wars over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir since gaining independence from British rule in 1947.",
