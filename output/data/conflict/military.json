    "description": "The commander of sea-drone operations for Ukraine’s military intelligence agency says more complex strikes against Russian forces are expected next year, after Kyiv’s uncrewed fleet succeeded in curbing the movements of Russia’s once-dominant Black Sea navy.  In an interview with The Associated Press, the head of the specialized maritime drone unit, Group 13, said Ukraine’s attacks have forced Russia to adapt, limiting opportunities for major Black Sea strikes seen earlier in the war.  Last month, Ukrainian officials said sea-attack drones were used in strikes against vessels in Russia’s sanctions-evading “shadow fleet” of oil tankers.",

However, to fill the time and relax for a while, Jung-kook decided to partake in some livestreaming on the South Korean app Weverse, which saw him go live for multiple consecutive days in a row to play some games with and sing some songs to viewers.\nHis game choices were quite eclectic. Fans wanted Jung-kook to check out games like Roblox (which he said he thinks he's heard of) and Outlast (which he claimed was too scary), but instead, he opted for the cute platformer Party Animals and the multiplayer racer Up N' Down.",
