    "fullText": "US Army drone school leaders said quickly changing battlefields mean the kind of companies the Army wants to work with are the ones making plug-and-play gear that's easily upgraded.\n\nThe Army is training soldiers for rapidly changing drone warfare. Leaders say keeping pace — and gaining an edge — requires weapons and systems that can evolve just as quickly.\n\nMaj. Wolf Amacker, who leads the Army's Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Tactics Branch at the Aviation Center of Excellence, told Business Insider that when it comes to defense companies, \"if whatever they're building isn't modular with other industry partners to work together, then I'm going to go with another industry partner that is.\"\n\nHe said that he wants to work with companies that, for example, can build a single arming tool compatible with multiple drone types, instead of requiring a separate tool for each platform.\n\nHe said ideally the companies are \"modular with how you can make that drop or that charge lethal through things that are already available and on hand.\"\n\nIn practice, modularity means designing systems with interchangeable parts — hardware and software that can be swapped or upgraded without replacing the entire system. That modularity, Amacker said, gives soldiers more flexibility in what weapons they field and how they employ them.\n\nHe said he wants companies that prioritize modularity, are willing to think outside the box, and avoid being stovepiped — instead of taking the approach of, \"This is my equipment, and if you want to use it, you just have to use what I give you.\"\n\nHe wants to work with companies that ask, \"Hey, how can we help you make your equipment even more useful and make those modifications with you?\"\n\nMaj. Rachel Martin, the director of the Army's Unmanned Advanced Lethality Course, a drone course designed to improve soldiers' lethal skills with small drones, agreed. She described drone warfare as a space where tactics and technology are shifting quickly.\n\nShe said that having industry working closely with the Army and making more adaptable gear is \"something that is happening at a faster pace than ever before in the military,\" particularly in the last two years.\n\nMartin said that industry partners have \"really risen to the challenge,\" but made clear that companies that aren't modular and adaptable will \"fall off our programs of record\" because \"we're not going to use something that doesn't work for us.\"\n\nShe said the best industry partners so far are ones that \"actively listen to soldiers.\" They observe training, absorb lessons, and adjust their systems to support what soldiers actually need \"instead of saying: 'Here, this is it, take it or leave it.'\"\n\nThey engage in real time, overnighting fixes and make big updates in a matter of weeks, rather than months or years.\n\nMartin said that if companies want soldiers to succeed, employ a system and \"feel like it works for them,\" then \"having that interface and that real-time conversation as we train is critical.\"\n\nRussia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has accelerated this shift, pushing many weapons makers to design systems that can be easily upgraded quickly based on soldier feedback and battlefield developments.\n\nThe tactics and technology in Ukraine are changing so rapidly that multiple arms, drone, and robot makers who have gear there previously told BI they've had to redesign their processes to keep up.\n\nThey are making weapons and combat system that can be updated far more easily by making them software-first and more modular, so only some parts need to be upgraded, or soldiers can swap parts themselves for different missions.\n\nUkrainian soldiers say they need flexible weapons systems that can be easily modified — even by troops at the front. Oleksandr Yabchanka, the head of robotic systems for Ukraine's Da Vinci Wolves Battalion, previously told BI that the ground robots his unit uses function like Lego sets: They can be reconfigured for different missions, whether evacuating wounded soldiers or attacking Russian positions.\n\nTo stay relevant, unmanned-systems makers say they cannot rely solely on building entirely new platforms to upgrade capability. It takes too long to develop, manufacture, and deliver gear like that.\n\nGediminas Guoba, CEO of Lithuanian drone company Granta Autonomy, which has drones in Ukraine, told Business Insider that his company can't just make systems that are simply ready for this year or the next; instead, they're building easily updated and upgraded systems to stay relevant further into the future.\n\nThe software inside its systems \"is changing every month\" and can be pushed to systems in Ukraine. It's very different from hardware changes made in factories and shipped to the battlefield.\n\nMatt McCrann, CEO of the US arm of counter-drone technology company DroneShield, told BI that the drone and counter-drone fight has sped up so much around the world since Russia's invasion of Ukraine that development cycles have been reduced to weeks, instead of the previous months or years. And the company has put more emphasis on modular and adaptable designs to be able to iterate quickly, he said.\n\nPatrick Shepherd, chief sales officer for Milrem Robotics, an Estonian company that makes autonomous ground robots that are used by Ukrainian soldiers, said the company deliberately does not design robots for single missions.\n\nInstead, it makes them so soldiers can customize them based on what they want to do, like evacuation, explosive disposal, intelligence gathering, or weaponized roles. That approach allows for much faster adaptation than what \"traditional, monolithic designs\" permit.",

    "fullText": "A data center executive said the recent backlash against the AI boom, led by the likes of Michael Burry and Jim Chanos, reminded him of Lex Luthor's army of keyboard-bashing monkeys in the newest \"Superman\" movie.\n\nFrank Holmes, the executive chairman of HIVE Digital Technologies, played a GIF from the movie during the company's earnings webcast last week. It showed one of the monkeys furiously typing the message: \"ONLY AN IDIOT WOULD BACK SUPERMAN.\"\n\nLuthor, Superman's archnemesis, memorably uses the monkeys to flood social media with hateful memes, hashtags, and vitriol. Mimicking real-life troll farms, the disinformation campaign succeeds in turning the world against the hero.\n\nHolmes also flashed up a slide with pictures of Burry and Chanos, followed by another filled with recent news headlines about their warnings.\n\n\"Jim Chanos comes out and: 'Short the bitcoin miners, short Nvidia, short the [high-performance computing], the hyperscalers, there's too much debt,'\" Holmes said.\n\n\"And Michael Burry is coming out,\" he continued. \"He came out a couple weeks ago. Again, he's short this market. And it really starts to grow, this negativity on the ecosystem.\"\n\nCommenting as the GIF played, Holmes said it was \"about Superman's credibility being destroyed.\"\n\n\"Well, the same thing happened out of nowhere, all this negativity was showing up on Instagram, and YouTube, and X,\" he added.\n\nHIVE builds and runs data centers powered by clean energy in Canada, Sweden, and Paraguay. Holmes dismissed negative news about Big Tech companies spending too much on data centers, saying the \"backup demand is just immense,\" and short-term traders were stirring the pot to help their short bets.\n\nBurry, the fund manager-turned-writer of \"The Big Short\" fame, reiterated his concerns about AI overinvestment in X posts over the weekend.\n\nA question I have for $ORCL, $GOOG, $META, $MSFT, $AMZN, $NVDA, $CAT, and all the rest, “When does the spending for AI data center buildout actually end?”\nIt is consuming all your cash flow, you are borrowing, you are financing in ways you never have, apparently because it is so… pic.twitter.com/fytMYDH942\n\n\"A question I have for $ORCL, $GOOG, $META, $MSFT, $AMZN, $NVDA, $CAT, and all the rest, \"When does the spending for AI data center buildout actually end?\" he queried.\n\n\"It is consuming all your cash flow, you are borrowing, you are financing in ways you never have, apparently because it is so urgent, because it scales?

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — The Mexican army killed the country’s most powerful cartel leader and one of the United States’ most wanted fugitives, notching a major victory while cartel members responded with a wave of violence across the country.\n\nThe killing Sunday of Jalisco New Generation Cartel leader Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes during an attempt to capture him in Jalisco state was the highest-profile blow against cartels since the recapture of former Sinaloa cartel boss Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán a decade ago.\n\nFollowing Oseguera Cervantes' death, security forces were placed on alert throughout the country as gunmen unleashed violence. Cars torched by cartel members blocked roads in 20 Mexican states. People locked themselves in their homes in Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city and Jalisco's capital, and school was canceled Monday in several states.\n\nThe killing could give the government a leg up in its dealings with the Trump administration, which has been threatening tariffs or unilateral military action if Mexico does not show results in the fight against the cartels. But the long-term effect on Mexico's security landscape remains unclear.\n\nOseguera Cervantes, better known as “El Mencho,” was 59 years old and originally from the western state of Michoacan. His ties to organized crime went back at least three decades.\n\nIn 1994, he was tried for trafficking heroin in the U.S. and sent to prison for three years. Upon returning to Mexico, he quickly rose through Mexico's drug trafficking underworld.\n\nAround 2009, he founded the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which became Mexico's fastest-growing criminal organization, moving cocaine, methamphetamines, fentanyl and migrants to the United States, and using violence with the use of drones and improvised explosive devices.\n\nThe cartel earned a reputation for brazen attacks on Mexican security forces, including downing a military helicopter in Jalisco in 2015 and attempting a spectacular, but unsuccessful, assassination of Mexico City Police Chief Omar García Harfuch, who is now Mexico's federal security secretary.\n\nIt recruited aggressively, experimenting with new ways to reach potential members online, and generated revenue through fuel theft, extortion and timeshare fraud, among other activities.\n\nOseguera Cervantes was killed during an attempt to capture him, as his followers attempted to fight off Mexican troops.\n\nMexico's Defense Secretary Ricardo Trevilla said Monday that the army and National Guard launched an operation in the southern part of Jalisco state to capture Oseguera Cervantes, involving the Mexican air force and special forces. Intelligence gathered about one of Oseguera Cervantes' romantic partners led them to his hideout, he said.\n\nThe cartel counterattacked, and in the ensuing confrontation, federal forces killed eight members of the criminal group. Oseguera Cervantes and two of his bodyguards were wounded and died later during transfer by air to Mexico City, Trevilla said.\n\nRocket launchers capable of shooting down aircraft and destroying armored vehicles were seized at the scene.\n\nOseguera Cervantes' death will help Mexico's government show results to the U.S., which is pressuring its neighbor to pursue drug cartels more aggressively. Both countries said intelligence cooperation helped lead to Sunday's operation.\n\nOseguera Cervantes was facing multiple indictments in the United States and the U.S. State Department had offered a $15 million reward for information leading to his arrest. The Trump administration designated his cartel and others foreign terrorist organizations a year ago.\n\nU.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, who was U.S. ambassador to Mexico during the first Trump administration, applauded the operation via X, writing: “The good guys are stronger than the bad guys. Congratulations to the forces of law and order in the great Mexican nation.”\n\nMike Vigil, former chief of international operations for the DEA, said Mexico had sent “a strong message to Donald Trump's administration that they are fighting aggressively and effectively” against the most powerful cartels. He added that “the majority of the information came from the Mexican armed forces and all credit goes to Mexico.”\n\nIt's not clear who will succeed Oseguera Cervantes, or if any one person can.\n\nThe Jalisco cartel has a presence in at least 21 of Mexico's 32 states and is active in almost all of the United States, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. But it is also a global organization and the loss of its leader could be felt well beyond Mexico.\n\n“El Mencho controlled everything, he was like a country's dictator,” Vigil said.\n\nHis absence could slow the cartel's rapid growth and expansion and leave it initially weakened against the Sinaloa cartel on several fronts where they or their proxies are fighting. The Sinaloa is locked in its own internal power struggle, however, between the sons of “El Chapo” and the faction loyal to Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, who is in U.S. custody.\n\nVigil said Mexico should seize the moment to launch “an effective frontal assault based on intelligence.”\n\n“This is a big opportunity for Mexico and the United States if they work together,” he said.\n\nSecurity analyst David Saucedo said that if relatives of Oseguera Cervantes take control of the cartel, the violence seen Sunday could continue. If others take power, they could be more willing to turn the page and continue operations.\n\nThe greatest fear would be that the cartel turns to indiscriminate violence. They could decide to “launch narcoterrorism attacks ... and generate a scenario similar to what Colombia lived in the 1990s,” a full-on attack against the government “car bombs, assassinations and attacks on aircraft.”",

    "description": "At the first annual Best Drone Warfighter competition, soldiers brought their homemade drones for test flights and evaluations.",
    "fullText": "The US Army is taking lessons from Ukraine's drone war and pushing soldiers to design, build, and 3D print their own systems.\n\nAt the Army's first annual Best Drone Warfighter competition held this week at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, the participating soldiers were encouraged not only to bring their own drone builds and modify them on-site but also to share tips and tricks across the service.\n\nArmy officials said this kind of innovation at the individual soldier level is essential to the Army's adoption of uncrewed aerial systems.\n\nThe competitive event allowed the Army to learn more about the skill sets behind its best drone operators, including seeing \"what kind of innovation, like grassroots soldier-level innovation is happening, that we can then take and scale across the Army,\" Col. Nicholas Ryan, director of Army UAS Transformation at the Aviation Center of Excellence and lead of the drone competition, told reporters.\n\nFor other aspects of the competition, like the obstacle course, standard drones such as the Necros Archer and Skydio intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance drone were used in order to level the playing field for evaluating operators. But troops were encouraged to bring their own builds for other parts of the competition.\n\nFor those events, the regulations weren't strict. \"Whether you received it as an Army program of record, you bought it off the shelf from the blue list, or you built it yourself, you 3D printed it and built it yourself, bring whatever you have,\" Ryan said, explaining that really the only rule was the drones had to fit in a rucksack.\n\nThe blue list refers to US government-approved drones that meet security and operational standards and contain either no or only a limited number of parts from companies in rival or adversarial countries like China and Iran.\n\nAt the competition's practice lane, operators from across the Army tested and flew drones they had built or bought, creating what officials said were the event's richest learning moments as soldiers swapped feedback and hard-earned lessons.\n\nTroops were also 3D printing custom parts for their drone kits — from antenna-carrying gear to helmet mounts for first-person-view goggles — items not currently fielded by the Army.\n\nHaving soldiers make and modify their own drones at the competition was a takeaway from Ukraine, as the Army had observed how operators and industry partners there are 3D printing parts for drones and modifying them with specific features and parts depending on mission sets or countermeasures.\n\nUsing 3D printed parts for repairs is key as well, as the war in Ukraine has shown that adaptation and experimentation with equipment often happens quicker than traditional supply chains allow for.\n\nUkraine has shown other Western militaries the importance of 3D printing as well. The technology can shorten procurement timelines, build a variety of designs and pieces that may be highly specialized or difficult to get otherwise, and give soldiers more of a say in the systems they need.\n\nRyan said that while the Army had been constrained in doing this type of work, new guidance like US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's drone dominance memo signaled the importance of giving soldiers the right to repair their systems. \"We need to allow our soldiers to fabricate and modify equipment that meets their needs and suits their needs,\" he said.\n\nThe Army has been implementing 3D printing and drone building into its drone courses and across divisions as it recognizes that giving soldiers the ability to repair drones or make changes to them in real-time could be an important edge on a future battlefield.",

    "fullText": "In the wake of the Mexican army’s assassination of Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, also known as “El Mencho,” the notorious leader of Mexico’s most powerful drug cartel, there were reports of widespread violence in the country, while U.S. citizens in portions of the country were urged to shelter in place amid flight cancellations.\n\nThe surprise operation against the drug kingpin and head of Jalisco New Generation Cartel unfolded Sunday morning in Tapalpa, a city about two hours southwest of Guadalajara, Jalisco’s capital.\n\nDuring the operation, troops came under fire and killed four people at the location. Three more people, including Oseguera Cervantes, were wounded and later died, according to a statement from the U.S. Defense Department. Two others were arrested and armored vehicles, rocket launchers and other arms were seized.\n\nThree members of the armed forces were wounded and received medical treatment, while one member of the country’s National Guard was killed. Another six other National Guardsmen reportedly died in an operation near Guadalajara, along with an agent from Jalisco’s state prosecutor’s office.\n\nA prison guard was also killed when inmates in a Puerto Vallarta prison rioted after reports of the deadly operation.\n\nEl Mencho’s assassination set off several hours of roadblocks with burning vehicles, tactics commonly used by the cartels to block military operations. Videos circulating on social media showed smoke billowing over the tourist city of Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco, and people sprinting through the airport of the state’s capital in panic.\n\nOfficials with the U.S. Embassy in Mexico said on X that the operation was executed by Mexican special forces “within the framework of bilateral cooperation, with U.S. authorities providing complementary intelligence.”\n\nThe U.S. State Department warned U.S. citizens in Jalisco, Tamaulipas, Michoacan, Guerrero and Nuevo Leon states to remain in safe places due to the ongoing security operations. Canada’s embassy in Mexico warned its citizens in Puerto Vallarta to shelter in place and generally to keep a low profile in Jalisco.\n\nJalisco Gov. Pablo Lemus told residents to stay at home and suspended public transportation.\n\nU.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau called El Mencho one of the bloodiest and most ruthless drug kingpins in cartel history in a statement.\n\n“This is a great development for Mexico, the US, Latin America, and the world,” he added. “I’m watching the scenes of violence from Mexico with great sadness and concern. It’s not surprising that the bad guys are responding with terror. But we must never lose our nerve.”\n\nThe Jalisco cartel has been one of the most aggressive cartels in its attacks on the military — including on helicopters — and is a pioneer in launching explosives from drones and installing mines. In 2020, it carried out a spectacular assassination attempt with grenades and high-powered rifles in the heart of Mexico City against the then head of the capital’s police force and now federal security secretary.\n\nVIDEO: Los Angeles motorist accused of running red light, causing violent crash\n\nThe DEA considers the cartel to be as powerful as the Sinaloa cartel, one of Mexico’s most infamous criminal groups, with a presence in all 50 U.S. states. It is one of the main suppliers of cocaine to the U.S. market and, like the Sinaloa cartel, earns billions from the production of fentanyl and methamphetamines. Sinaloa, however, has been weakened by infighting after the loss of its leaders Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada and Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, both in U.S. custody.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, like many of her predecessors, have argued that taking out cartel leaders only triggers continued violence as cartels fracture and fight for power.\n\nSheinbaum said in a statement on X that the army had coordinated with the governments of all Mexican states and urged people to “remain informed and calm,” while recognizing the Mexican military’s operation.\n\n“We work every day for peace, security and justice, and the well-being of Mexico,” she said.\n\nLocally, Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn acknowledged those in the county with family in Mexico.\n\n“I know many here in LA County with loved ones in Mexico—especially in Jalisco and Michoacán—are closely following the events in Mexico today with concern and with sadness,” she said on X. “I am keeping them in my thoughts and praying for peace.”\n\nSupervisor Katrina Foley, Vice Chair of the Orange County Board of Supervisors said she has friends sheltering in place in Puerto Vallarta and shared Rep. Dave Min’s post about what stranded U.S. travelers should do.\n\nSeveral airlines, including Delta, United, Alaska and Air Canada urged either temporarily cancelled flights into Puerto Vallarta and Guadalajara or urged passengers to check on their flights before traveling to the airport.",

    "description": "The Army's first annual Best Drone Warfighter competition shed some new light on the ideal backgrounds and skill sets for drone pilots.",
    "fullText": "The US Army used its first Best Drone Warfighter competition not just to test skills, officials say, but to identify what makes a top drone operator — and who in the force is best suited for the job.\n\nRather than training every soldier to fly drones, the Army is using competition to identify the skill sets of top drone operators and whether there are specific roles within units that would make the most sense for working with uncrewed aerial systems.\n\nThe effort reflects a broader shift from treating drone flying as something for all soldiers to approaching it as a specialized skill set that requires the right aptitude, training, and sustained practice.\n\nThe inaugural drone competition took place this week at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, gathering teams from across active, Reserve, and National Guard units. There were no requirements on what types of soldiers could participate or where they came from.\n\nRather, \"it was just send your best UAS operators,\" Col. Nicholas Ryan, director of Army UAS Transformation at the Aviation Center of Excellence, told reporters, prompting a mix of operators with different backgrounds and expertise.\n\nOver three days, soldiers competed in multiple events, testing their piloting skills. The first was an obstacle course that operators navigated using first-person-view drones.\n\nThe second was a hunter-killer scenario in which teams used a reconnaissance drone to survey an array of targets and decide which were highest priority for simulated strikes with one-way attack drones. The competition didn't involve any kinetic strikes; instead, soldiers flew the drones into nets on the targets.\n\nThe third event was focused on innovation. Soldiers could build, modify, and test their own drones.\n\nRyan said that the Army was taking notes throughout the competition on who the top operators were, calling it talent management.\n\n\"At the end of the day,\" he said, \"it's not about receiving trophies or awards,\" it is about identifying what sets the top drone operators apart and figuring out how they developed those skills. The goal, he said, is to understand \"what lessons can we take from this to find out who the best operator is and how they became the best operator. What skills and resources and training allowed them to become the best operator?\"\n\nSoldiers in the US and Ukraine have noticed that gamers make excellent drone pilots, as do soldiers who have experience piloting hobby drones.\n\n\"That's something we're absolutely looking at right now,\" Ryan said.\n\nArmy leaders have previously noted a correlation between soldiers who grew up playing video games — or who are active gamers — and drone proficiency.\n\nTroops who game have shown quick reflexes, precise hand-eye coordination, and strong spatial awareness that make them competent with drones.\n\nAt an exercise in Germany last fall, a US Army captain told Business Insider that the top pilots were soldiers who \"when they got off on Fridays, then go and play video games.\"\n\nThe Army has been restructuring its approach to drone warfare, rewriting its training and focusing on integrating soldiers with small drone training into front-line units. Lessons and approaches are being shared across the service, building a broader doctrine on how the Army is adopting drones.\n\nRyan said that the service is realizing that flying drones needs to be a dedicated assignment. \"You can't be a squad rifleman and a drone operator,\" he said, explaining that \"it's one or the other because you have to have the level of skill and expertise in operating and employing the drones. That's what you have to be good at and train at and focus on for most of your time.\"\n\nOther Army officials said efforts like the competition were demonstrating where drones best fit in a formation and what aspects of training are most important to maintain these highly perishable skills.\n\nFor the most part, soldiers flew their drones successfully, but the Army did take note of communication breakdowns as soldiers went through the hunter-killer lane, specifically getting drones into position and identifying and simulating strikes on targets.\n\n\"That's an example of something we didn't anticipate, but it's absolutely standing out as that is something we as an Army need to do better on,\" Ryan said. \"If we're going to proliferate these drones and want them to be more effective and lethal, we just need to improve on how our soldiers talk to each other to communicate when they're using them.\"\n\nIn future iterations of the Best Drone Warfighter competition, the Army hopes to include kinetic elements as well as electronic warfare and jamming to better replicate real-world scenarios.",

    "fullText": "Creators say they’re offering Africans a ‘hopeful, utopian feeling’ of retrieving objects looted by colonial armies\n\nA new South African video game lets players take back African artefacts held in western museums in a series of heists, amid a growing campaign to repatriate treasures looted by colonial armies.\n\nPlayers of Relooted become South African sports scientist and parkour expert Nomali, as she leaps and dives through museums to retrieve 70 real objects. They include an Asante gold mask that was taken by the British army when it destroyed the Asante empire’s capital, Kumasi, and is now in the Wallace Collection in London. Another object is the skull of the Tanzanian king Mangi Meli, which was taken to Germany after its colonial regime executed him in 1900.\n\nHundreds of thousands of culturally and spiritually significant items were looted from Africa during the 19th and 20th centuries, when European countries carved up the continent into colonies. A 2018 report commissioned by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, estimated that more than 90% of Africa’s material cultural heritage was held outside the continent.\n\nBerlin’s Ethnologisches Museum and Cambridge University are among the institutions to have returned Benin bronzes to Nigeria, for example. Others, including the British Museum, have resisted calls to return bronzes and other looted objects.\n\nBen Myres, chief executive of Nyamakop, which developed Relooted, said: “Real-life repatriation is enormously complicated and it’s been ongoing for decades, in some cases even a century or more … We’re giving people this hopeful, utopian feeling … of what it’s going to feel like when all these artefacts finally come home.”\n\nMyres started creating the game in 2018 after his mother returned from the British Museum outraged at seeing the Nereid Monument, a Lycian tomb from Turkey. The museum says it was brought to the UK “with the full permission of the Ottoman Turkish authorities”.\n\n“She was shocked by the audacity of stealing a building … and she very flippantly said you should make a game about taking this back to where it belongs,” he said.\n\nThe game was created by a team from more than 10 African countries, while voice actors were hired from the countries of the characters that make up Nomali’s heist crew.\n\nMohale Mashigo, the game’s narrative director, said: “If we were going to go as far as researching real artefacts, getting a pronunciation guide for the artefacts, creating these characters from Cameroon, DRC, Malawi and [more], I wanted to make sure it sounded like different voices from different places.”\n\nMashigo created an “Africanfuturist” vision of the continent at the end of the 21st century, with cities and countries that “work for people”, rather than the more fantastical genre of Afrofuturism.\n\nIn contrast, Europe and the United States were intentionally made generic, as “The Old World” and “The Shiny Place” respectively. “We wanted to parody the way the west represents Africa,” Myres said.\n\nThe museums are also not real, apart from the Museum of Black Civilisations in Dakar, where players return the looted objects to an symbolically empty hall before they make their final journey to their home country.\n\nFor the game producer, Sithe Ncube, it was important that the Kabwe Skull, a 300,000-year-old fossil discovered in her country, Zambia, was included. The skull, also known as Broken Hill Man, is in London’s Natural History Museum.\n\nShe said: “Even before I started working at Nyamakop … I just felt like … someone should get it back and it would be cool for someone to do this in some form of media, in a game.”\n\nCreating Relooted was an eye-opening experience, Ncube said. “Learning about the scale of artefact looting in Africa, up to now I still can’t wrap my head around the numbers. It seems quite ridiculous and probably underestimated as well.”",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Armed group Hezbollah rejected on Tuesday the Lebanese government's decision to grant the army at least four months ‌to advance the second phase of a nationwide disarmament plan, saying it would not ‌accept what it sees as a move serving Israel.\n\nLebanon's cabinet tasked the army in August 2025 with drawing up and ​beginning to implement a plan to bring all armed groups' weapons under state control, a bid aimed primarily at disarming Hezbollah after its devastating war with Israel in 2024.\n\nIn September 2025 the cabinet formally welcomed the army's plan to disarm the Iran-backed Shi'ite militia, although it did not set a ‌clear timeframe and cautioned that ⁠the military's limited capabilities and ongoing Israeli strikes could hinder progress.\n\nHezbollah Secretary-General Sheikh Naim Qassem said in a speech on Monday that \"what the Lebanese government ⁠is doing by focusing on disarmament is a major mistake because this issue serves the goals of Israeli aggression\".\n\nLebanon's Information Minister Paul Morcos said during a press conference late on Monday after a cabinet meeting ​that ​the government had taken note of the army's monthly ​report on its arms control plan ‌that includes restricting weapons in areas north of the Litani River up to the Awali River in Sidon, and granted it four months.\n\n\"The required time frame is four months, renewable depending on available capabilities, Israeli attacks and field obstacles,” he said.\n\nHezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah said, \"we cannot be lenient,\" signalling the group's rejection of the timeline and the broader approach to the issue of its ‌weapons.\n\nHezbollah has rejected the disarmament effort as a misstep ​while Israel continues to target Lebanon, and Shi'ite ministers walked ​out of the cabinet session in ​protest.\n\nIsrael has said Hezbollah's disarmament is a security priority, arguing that the group's ‌weapons outside Lebanese state control pose a ​direct threat to its ​security.\n\nIsraeli officials say any disarmament plan must be fully and effectively implemented, especially in areas close to the border, and that continued Hezbollah military activity constitutes a violation of ​relevant international resolutions.\n\nIsrael has also said ‌it will continue what it describes as action to prevent the entrenchment or arming ​of hostile actors in Lebanon until cross-border threats are eliminated.",

    "fullText": "Mark Cuban expects legions of workers will be needed to implement AI at companies, creating a huge opportunity for tech-savvy young people.\n\nThe tech billionaire and former \"Shark Tank\" investor made the prediction during an August interview with TBPN, a tech talk show and podcast.\n\nAI guru Rohan Paul shared a clip of Cuban's comments over the weekend, which was widely reposted; Cuban himself shared three responses from other AI gurus on his X feed.\n\nOne declared it the \"MOST underrated clip on the internet right now.\" Another drew a parallel to Salesforce and the millions of administrative and integration roles it spawned. A third heralded a shift from generic software to customized intelligence.\n\nCuban is calling the IT services boom of the 2000s, but for intelligence instead of infrastructure. Every wave of business technology from PCs to cloud to mobile spawned a massive local services layer. The AI wave needs the same thing, and 33 million companies are waiting. \n\nThe… https://t.co/sgBXH1VJLd\n\nCuban told TBPN that when he was 24, he would walk into companies and executives would point to their secretaries and receptionists and say they didn't need a PC. Cuban recognized that as an opportunity to sell old-school bosses on the benefits of computers and teach them how to use them.\n\nHe said it's a similar situation with the latest tech wave, which some believe will render millions of human workers obsolete and trigger mass unemployment.\n\nCuban said he advises high-school and college students to not just \"learn all you can about AI, but learn more on how to implement them in companies.\"\n\nCuban, a minority owner of the Dallas Mavericks, said that tens of millions of US companies don't have AI budgets or AI experts.\n\n\"This is where kids getting hired coming out of college are really going to have a unique opportunity,\" he said. They should spend their free time learning how to use different AI tools, make AI videos, and customize AI models so they can teach business leaders in any industry how to harness the tech, he added.\n\n\"That is every single job that's going to be available for kids coming out of school because every single company needs that,\" Cuban said. \"There is nothing intuitive for a company to integrate AI and that's what people don't understand.\"\n\nCuban emphasized the opportunity isn't limited to software engineers. Many older workers are \"afraid\" to ask complex questions to AI models, he said, unlike \"kids coming out of school today that are fearless in the questions they ask and the followups and their ability to prompt.\"\n\n\"That's jobs for everybody,\" he added.",

    "description": "Lessons from the conflict are still important to the Finnish Army, especially the Jaeger Brigade, which specializes in Arctic warfare.",
    "fullText": "Combat has changed in the decades since Finland's Winter War with Russia, but one key lesson still shapes how it thinks about fighting in the Arctic.\n\nDense forests and deep snow force armies onto narrow roads, and disrupting those roadways can shape the battle.\n\nIn northern Finland today, soldiers are still training for that reality as they prepare for a potential future fight in the Arctic.\n\nBusiness Insider recently traveled to the snow-blanketed Lapland region and observed the Finnish Army's elite Jaeger Brigade in action as it led roughly 20 NATO soldiers through an annual Arctic warfare and cold-weather survival course.\n\nMaj. Mikael Aikio, the Jaeger Brigade's Arctic section leader who oversees the course, said in an interview that in the frozen Arctic and heavily forested terrain, vehicles quickly become restricted to plowed roads and narrow supply routes, potential bottlenecks for an invading force if leveraged strategically.\n\nThat constraint, which is known in warfare as canalization, means large formations can be slowed, isolated, and destroyed if an enemy seizes, targets, or disrupts key stretches of roadway.\n\nAfter World War II broke out and Finland refused Soviet demands to cede border territory near Leningrad, the Red Army invaded on November 30, 1939, in what many expected would be a swift victory.\n\nThe Soviet Union entered the war with overwhelming numerical superiority, while Finland relied on a much smaller, lightly equipped force. Yet the Red Army paid a far higher price. In just over three months of fighting, Soviet casualties reached into the hundreds of thousands, far exceeding Finland's losses.\n\nThe Finns forced enemy troops into narrow, defenseless, or difficult terrain and then employed their \"motti\" strategy to split Soviet columns like firewood. The Finns were able to harass isolated troops cut off from support with snipers and raids by ski troops, inflicting heavy casualties and crushing morale.\n\nOne prominent battle unfolded along the Raate Road in Suomussalmi, a narrow forest supply route where Soviet columns were forced into a long, vulnerable line. Finnish forces cut the road at multiple points and destroyed the trapped units. The Red Army suffered substantial losses.\n\nThe Soviets ultimately won the war, but they paid an extremely heavy price for the victory.\n\nIn the 86 years since the end of the Winter War, weapons technology has changed dramatically. Vehicles are more capable, sensors are more advanced, and long-range fires are much more precise.\n\nHowever, Aikio, the Finnish major, stressed that the terrain in northern Finland has not changed.\n\n\"The weapons are different, and you have different technologies that you have now that you didn't back then, but the terrain is pretty much the same,\" Aikio said. And that still limits where soldiers and vehicles can move.\n\nDuring the Jaeger Brigade's Arctic warfare course, dismounted soldiers learn to use skis and snowmobiles to maneuver on the battlefield. Heavy tracked vehicles and trucks mostly have to stick to the roads, though; it doesn't matter if it's a tank from the late 1930s or a massive supply truck today — the same problems that existed during World War II persist.\n\nEven modern armored vehicles would be heavily influenced by the harsh terrain, forcing large formations and their logistics onto limited maneuver corridors. A single Russian tank, for instance, might be able to get creative and drive through the heavy snow, but this becomes less reliable at scale.\n\nGiven those constraints, Finland's thinking is not about replicating 1939 but rather forcing an attacker into predictable corridors, attriting supplies, breaking force cohesion, and straining logistics to weaken an adversary. That would be backed by modern combat capabilities, such as aircraft and significant artillery, as well as allied assets.\n\nThe effectiveness of these tactics has been seen in modern warfighting.\n\nIn Ukraine, large Russian formations have struggled when constrained to limited road networks, particularly when logistics faltered, and the Ukrainians were able to disrupt supply routes. The comparison with the Winter War isn't exact, but it underscores how terrain and sustainment still shape how armies move.",

    "description": "Personnel won't be able to fully process all the data available on the modern battlefield. That's where artificial intelligence applications come in.",
    "fullText": "Army leaders say the modern battlefield is so saturated with sensors and networked weapons generating more data than soldiers can realistically process on their own that artificial intelligence is needed to meaningfully sort it all.\n\nFor years, the Army's focus was on fielding more sensors for battlefield information and awareness, but now the service is also having to think about information overload and managing the massive amounts of data coming in.\n\nDuring a recent US Army and NATO exercise in Europe, troops used a homegrown AI system to consume and sort data. The value wasn't strictly that the AI could do it faster but rather that it could remember context and patterns that humans couldn't.\n\nThe case from the Dynamic Front exercise is another example of how the US military is increasingly implementing AI and automation into everything from enemy attack simulations to paperwork.\n\n\"The modern battlefield, what we're already seeing across the globe, it is swimming in sensors, and we are drowning in data,\" Col. Jeff Pickler, the Army 2nd Multi-Domain Task Force commander, said at a media roundtable on Dynamic Front.\n\nThere aren't enough people to decipher all the available information, he said. \"They will never be able to fully process all of that.\"\n\nThe software aimed at addressing that problem remains in beta testing. In the next iteration of Dynamic Front — which will merge with another exercise, Arcane Front, to pair technology experimentation with theater-level combat rehearsals — Army leaders say they intend to test the AI at a larger scale.\n\n\"If we're looking at a target set in the European theater where we think we're going to need to process upwards of 1,500 targets a day, that's beyond the human scope,\" Pickler said. \"The answer to the equation there is in AI and automations.\"\n\nDuring a potential large-scale conflict in Europe, AI could assist in locating and assessing those targets.\n\nThe system can do this quickly, but the speed isn't the main benefit. AI can remember patterns that humans might forget or not even notice. Pickler gave an example of AI realizing that unrelated shipping reports, a local power outage, and a fertilizer delivery together might suggest missile fueling activity.\n\n\"So the difference isn't seconds versus minutes — it's minutes instead of months. Not because the machine scans quickly, but because it keeps context across sources that humans can't hold in memory,\" Pickler said after the roundtable.\n\n\"It doesn't replace analysts by reading faster,\" he said, \"it replaces the weeks analysts spend reconnecting information spread across thousands of reports.\"\n\nIn a conflict scenario, that could mean analysts reach a clearer picture of the battlefield faster. Correlations between data gathered from different sensors could surface more quickly. If an adversary were fueling, arming, or moving weapons in ways that were not immediately obvious, AI could help flag those links.\n\nHumans, though, would still decide how to respond.\n\nSoldiers have seen success with iterating on the current AI model, the Army said. It's been retooled during testing, and humans remain in the loop, reviewing outputs at multiple stages.\n\nThe goal is to continue increasing the overlap the model would have with human-produced information. In a targeting example, a milestone would be if AI achieved 90 to 95% agreement with humans on 100 target sets.\n\nThe Army's push for AI and automation is also driving the development of its Next Generation Command and Control software, a priority initiative.\n\nThe technology being developed by vendor teams including Anduril, Palantir, and Lockheed Martin uses AI and machine learning to provide commanders and soldiers with real-time data on ammunition levels, maintenance needs, intelligence feeds, targeting, and simulated enemy attacks.\n\nBut AI is also changing other aspects of how the Army works. Autonomous features in drones, weapons, and targeting might be at the forefront, but behind the scenes, personnel are using new tools, redesigned workflows, and data integration for recruiting, maintenance, and inventors. These are manual tasks that the service believes can be improved with AI.",

    "description": "The Nations League does not carry the prestige of other competitions, but Thursday's draw still carries huge importance to Scotland and the Tartan Army.",
    "fullText": "Who needs the Nations League? Now Steve Clarke has ended decades of heartache and taken Scotland to the World Cup, does anything else matter?\n\nUnderstandably, ever since December's gala draw for the summer's finals in North America, every Scotland fan has been consumed with thoughts of facing Haiti, Morocco and Brazil.\n\nThe prospect of partying at the finals for the first time since 1998 has given long-suffering supporters plenty to savour and there's been no need to look beyond, nor anything definite to anticipate.\n\nThat changes the Nations League draw in Belgium on Thursday evening, when Scotland's opponents for matches in the second half of 2026 are confirmed.\n\nCompared to Fifa's festival of football, or even the Euros, it's small potatoes, of course, but these games could hold huge importance for tournaments to come and the development of the national team after their tests in North America.\n\nHow does the Nations League work and when is the draw?\n\nAnother plot twist in Scottish title race for the ages\n\nSince being introduced in 2018 in an attempt to add more structure to the international calendar and phase out meaningless friendlies, the competition has followed a familiar format.\n\nNational teams are split into four tiers based on promotion and relegation from the last edition, theoretically putting sides of the same level together.\n\nEach of these tiers are split into groups of four and there's promotion and relegation through the divisions. The best teams in League A then go on into a knock-out finals tournament the following summer with the champions crowned at the end. Simple.\n\nScotland played in the top flight in the last edition back in 2024 but finished in third place in their group behind eventual champions Portugal and Croatia. That put the national team in a play-off to fight for survival and defeat by Greece meant relegation to League B.\n\nRevenge on the Greeks was served in the successful World Cup qualification last year, of course, but Thursday's draw will put Scotland back in familiar territory in the second tier of the Nations League.\n\nScotland are in Pot 1 of the League B draw, but a quick look at the possible opposition puts paid to any ideas that it means an easy draw.\n\nHungary, Poland and Israel are the only sides Scotland cannot face, but with the likes of Switzerland, Republic of Ireland and Sweden as a potential group of opponents, fans won't be taking success for granted. Though do we ever?\n\nPot 1: Scotland, Hungary, Poland, Israel\n\nPot 2: Switzerland, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Austria, Ukraine\n\nPot 3: Slovenia, Georgia, Republic of Ireland, Romania\n\nPot 4: Sweden, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Kosovo\n\nScotland will play each opponent home and away, with the fixtures grouped into three double-headers in September, October and November.\n\nGroup winners are promoted automatically, runners-up go into a play-off against a League A side, third faces a relegation play-off and fourth takes a drop straight into League C.\n\nEven eight years after its introduction, the competition does not have the allure of its counterparts, but it is still an important part of the international calendar, especially for Scotland.\n\nHead coach Clarke has spoken repeatedly about how his players need to face strong opposition to keep improving.\n\nThis time around, they will not be playing Europe's elite, but competitive games against sides of a similar level present a good test and strong preparation for the next set of European Championship qualifiers.\n\nPromotion brings prestige, glamour games next time around and prize money, but arguably the real prizes come in how a successful campaign sets Scotland up for the future.\n\nThe seeding for qualification campaigns and finals is always a complicated affair, but there is one simple truth that applies to them all. Winning games pushes a team up the rankings and into a better position - and winning competitive games is more valuable than victory in friendlies.\n\nThere is also the importance of a good Nations League as a lifeline to reach major finals. Four teams who failed to qualify for the World Cup directly have been given a second chance through the play-offs due to their Nations League record.\n\nAnd let us not forget that Scotland's long exodus from a major finals was ended because of a Nations League lifeline – the emotion of the play-off victory in Serbia that sealed a place at Euro 2020 was only possible because of a strong campaign.\n\nIt should not be the case that the national team needs a similar chance to reach Euro 2028, but a horrible set of circumstances could arise that make Nations League success essential.\n\nAs co-hosts of the tournament, the idea of Scotland not making the finals and seeing fans of other nations celebrating at Hampden in unthinkable.\n\nHowever, with four nations hosting the finals, Scotland, England, Wales and Republic of Ireland all have to go through the qualification campaign.\n\nIn an ideal world, the national team succeeds there and books a place, with three group games at Hampden guaranteed.\n\nUefa has set aside two places for host nations who fail to qualify in an attempt to make sure all four are in the tournament proper.\n\nHowever, if more than two of the four fail to qualify automatically, it comes down to qualifying ranking and Scotland could conceivably miss out altogether.\n\nIn that specific case, having a play-off place banked from the Nations League would be heaven sent.\n\nThere is one other intriguing footnote to the draw: it could set up the opposition for the next Scotland head coach's first game in charge.\n\nClarke's contract expires after the World Cup and there is no indication if he will carry on in the job, regardless of what happens at the finals.\n\nIf Clarke does leave in the summer, his successor's first matches will be in the Nations League and a new era for the national team will begin when League B kicks off.\n\nBBC Scotland will have live text coverage of the Nations League draw from 17:00 GMT.",

    "fullText": "Huw Jones can't remember how many touches of the ball he got in the rain in Rome last Saturday, but he knows it wasn't many.\n\nHe's sure he had a few in the closing minutes - the 29 phases that ultimately amounted to nothing - but beyond that, the day passed him by.\n\nA Scotland backline built to attack managed the grand total of zero line breaks against Italy - the only nation to draw a blank in this respect on the opening weekend and the first time in many, many years the Scotland attack was so hopelessly blunt.\n\nZero line breaks is an absolute rarity. Even in the Calcutta Cup monsoon in Edinburgh in 2020 Scotland managed three. The weather was a major factor in Rome, of course, but it didn't stop Italy making six line breaks of their own. They found a way. Jones doesn't hide from it. He can't.\n\nThe Calcutta Cup, he says, is the \"perfect game\" now. Be careful what you wish for and all of that, but you get his point. A heaving Murrayfield, the Scots with their backs to the wall, England on a mighty roll, a shot at redemption. We've all seen this kind of ambush before.\n\nJones has played in seven Calcutta Cups, winning four, losing three while scoring six tries. It's a fine record, but he concedes that the England coming to Edinburgh this weekend is possibly the strongest of all the England sides he has faced, including the one that did Scotland in cold blood at Twickenham in 2017. Jones scored two tries that day but England won 60-21.\n\n\"After a loss when everyone's hurting and when we didn't really get to play, we all have that pent-up frustration and energy,\" says Jones.\n\n\"Even if we'd won I would have come away knowing I didn't get to do anything. I'm really angry about that and this week adds to the fuel of just wanting to go out and show what we can do. It's the perfect one for us to come back to.\"\n\nListen: Has Townsend finally run out of time?\n\nJones drew the short straw on Tuesday. Media duty.\n\nAnd inevitably more questions about Rome. Just when he thought he was out, we pull him back in. He said the changing room after the 18-15 defeat was one of the toughest he's ever been in. Not a revelation, but he did his best to explain the angst they all felt.\n\n\"We've all experienced losses but everyone was really dejected after that,\" he said.\n\nThen he went through the various stages of defeat - tiredness, confusion, frustration, anger.\n\n\"The anger probably comes on the Sunday,\" he says. \"Then you do the review and you have to be very clinical about your review. You try not to let emotions get in the way of that process.\n\n\"No-one's hiding. It's horrible and what's tough for the public is that you don't get to be in those conversations, so you're seeing the loss and stewing over it for the whole week but not getting answers because you're not in our meetings.\n\n\"Part of being a professional rugby player is you have to get back to work immediately and you have to park those emotions - but you use that as fuel.\"\n\nThe loss has been analysed but not exorcised is his gist.\n\nHe speaks about the team battling their way downfield and getting good field position. A penalty to Scotland and a chance of points, then a reversal on account of poor discipline and they're back to where they started. That happened twice, on top of all their other woes.\n\n\"Those are really difficult to take. You've got to get up and go again. I felt that we kept doing that - wrestling that momentum to get downfield but we kept letting ourselves down when we got there.\n\n\"I don't think that's a psychological thing, I think that's execution. Once you get down there we just have to be better. The first 20 minutes was where the game was lost.\n\n\"They got two chances off launches and scored within three phases. We also got down their end early on and did nothing with it,\" added Jones, with the two attacking lineouts that were lost in Italy's 22 coming to mind.\n\nPart of the job this week is locking out the negativity that is banging on their door. He knows that England have suffered at Scotland's hands many times in recent years and that they'll be playing on that.\n\nThere is no Scottish monopoly on edge just because they're fighting to right some wrongs from Rome.\n\n\"They're on a big run of victories at the moment and they've got a great squad,\" Jones said.\n\n\"They've developed almost an all-court game where they've got their big pack expecting to be dominant in most games but they've also got brilliant athletes and good ball-players as well. It's a tough prospect.\"\n\nFor Jones and his salvation army it's a day to gird the loins and fight back. In front of their own people, if they have anything about them, there's surely some thunder coming on Saturday.\n\nThe questions Townsend must answer before Calcutta Cup\n\n'Townsend on the ropes after romp in swamp'",

    "description": "A new command-and-control system is expected to make planning and decision-making faster and easier.",
    "fullText": "New US Army warfighting software is speeding up and simplifying the command job, a commander said recently, sharing that it lets him scrap the \"hourlong staff meetings\" to make decisions.\n\nThe Army, like other services, believes that future wars will be determined by the speed of decision-making. That's where the new Next Generation Command and Control, or NGC2, program is expected to make a substantial impact and modernize how the service fights.\n\nAt Fort Carson, Colorado, the Army's 4th Infantry Division has been testing NGC2 in a series of exercises. The most recent one, Ivy Sting 4, added more components to the system, with different types of sensors and weapons on the battlefield feeding into one system that everyone can access.\n\n\"So it's all in one place, and it's there very, very quickly, so that the staff can see it across their functional systems,\" said Maj. Gen. Patrick Ellis, commander of the 4th ID, at a recent media roundtable, explaining that \"the fires person can see what the logistician sees, can see what the intel person sees.\"\n\n\"I don't have to have the hourlong staff meeting anymore,\" the general said.\n\n\"If we're actually using the technology as the tool that we're prepping on and that we're also fighting on,\" he said, \"I could sit there, I can look at it, I can make decisions, I can say, 'Hey, here are my priorities for this or that.' We all agree on it, we click save, and that's done.\"\n\nThe Army has facilitated the development of NGC2 with both the 4th ID and 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii and industry teams, including Anduril and Lockheed Martin, pursuing a Silicon Valley-style approach aimed at moving faster and rapidly integrating soldier feedback, delivering fixes immediately rather than months or years later.\n\nOn the heels of Ivy Sting 4, more than two weeks of field testing that involved live-fire exercises and an electronic warfare jamming scenario, Ellis and others said that NGC2 was making planning and executing battlefield missions more effective.\n\n\"We are no longer fighting with the network; we are now fighting using the network,\" Ellis said.\n\nDuring the Ivy Sting 4 testing event, 20 different types of sensors, such as drones, electronic warfare systems, artillery, and Stryker vehicles, were linked together.\n\nData and artificial intelligence capabilities provide real-time information on the sensors. Soldiers can see how much ammunition they've got left or whether a Stryker will need maintenance or fuel soon. Simulations can predict what resources will be needed for certain tactics or actions, including different ways an enemy might attack.\n\nAs different platforms are brought onto NGC2, broadening what the platform can do, Army command and soldiers can see and communicate using the same data. The system is breaking down the silos that have previously hindered information flow.\n\n\"I'm feeling empowered as a commander to make more, better, and faster decisions because I've got access to all that data,\" Ellis explained.\n\nMany NGC2 components are being built with off-the-shelf technology and standard commercial software practices, and the vendor teams involved are working on the ground with soldiers. The closer working relationship means soldier feedback is being incorporated more quickly.\n\n\"We work through these obstacles, and we learn how to do something, and once we run into a roadblock, we figure out a way to solve that problem, and then that problem is now solved for the Army,\" he said. \"We're not relearning these lessons over and over again.\"",

    "description": "The war in Ukraine showed the US Army just how effective small drones can be. They can be more than scouts. They can be offensive weapons.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine showed the US Army just how effective small drones can be, not just as scouts, but as offensive weapons, officials told Business Insider.\n\nMaj. Wolf Amacker, who leads the Army’s Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Tactics Branch at the Aviation Center of Excellence, told Business Insider the service had a capability “gap\" due to having long viewed small drones primarily as tools for surveillance and reconnaissance.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine unlocked a world of new realizations with regard to drone warfare.\n\nFacing an existential crisis, the Ukrainians had to develop a way to counter hostile forces cheaply yet with mass. That meant figuring out how to turn inexpensive drones into weaponry, a step that quickly and fundamentally changed how the war was being fought. Now, drones carry out 80% of all battlefield hits and are responsible for most combat casualties.\n\nDrones had been used in warfare prior to Russia's invasion, but this is different. The dramatic shift in warfare has inspired Ukraine's partners, including the US, to up their training on drone warfare and production of small drones.\n\n\"We're still a very capable force as a US Army,\" Amacker said; however, \"there is a new capability that we just don't have fielded across the force yet.\"\n\nThat's changing though. The Army has been increasingly prioritizing small drone operations, using them the way that the Ukrainians do, to direct fire and drop grenades, among other actions. Drones are also an important part of the Army's major transformation initiative.\n\nCritical skills are now being taught at the Aviation Center of Excellence's Unmanned Advanced Lethality Course in Fort Rucker, which began last year and aims to train soldiers to lethally employ small drones in combat. This includes learning to pilot and attack, as well as use drones to support traditional fire missions with artillery.\n\nMaj. Rachel Martin, the course's director, said that Ukraine has shown the US what it needs to learn.\n\n\"The eyes of the world are on the Russo-Ukrainian war and the tactics and equipment that are being utilized in that type of warfare,\" she said, explaining that \"in America, that is not a style of warfare that we're accustomed to, where we're heavily using robotics and unmanned systems in order to target in the near fight.\"\n\nShe said it's \"a doctrinal and tactical thing that we weren't prepared for a year ago, but we're rapidly getting better at it as we go through.\"\n\nUkraine uses small aerial drones, like first-person-view quadcopters, to gather intelligence on Russian troops and equipment positions, but also to directly attack soldiers and equipment. Those drones have killed troops, exposed defensive positions, and destroyed high-value systems such as tanks.\n\nUS military drones have long been mostly large, fixed-wing aircraft deployed for reconnaissance and intelligence gathering or armed strike. Those drones, systems like the MQ-9 Reaper or RQ-4 Global Hawk, are typically operated by the Air Force, rather than the Army, and they are expensive, millions of dollars each.\n\nMartin said Ukraine's battlefield experience showed the Army that inexpensive drones can destroy weapon systems worth millions of dollars. It's a capability the Army couldn't afford to ignore.\n\nThe Army is looking into restructuring combat units to prioritize drones as weapons, including creating new specialized, drone-led strike units.\n\nCol. Nick Ryan, who oversees US Army drone integration, explained to CNN in September that he wants soldiers to look at their drone \"as if it was their personal weapon,\" or their radio, their night-vision goggles, or a grenade.\n\nMartin said that the Army test units struggled early on simply learning to fly small drones. First-person-view drones, she said, \"require a high skill level,\" and many units weren't resourced for that initially.\n\n\"What we want is not just flying,\" she said, \"but employing those systems lethally.\"\n\nThat presents additional challenges. \"The lethal part is very complicated,\" Martin said, requiring risk management, approvals, and handling munitions that most soldiers don't regularly train with. \"So this course was created here.\"\n\nShe described lethal drone use as something infantry training has only begun to incorporate recently.\n\nPart of the training course emphasizes limits as well as capabilities. Martin said students are taught that drones are a tool, not a universal solution.\n\n\"Ultimately, drones are a tool,\" she said, \"but there are other tools available.\"\n\nUkraine turned heavily to drones in part because it lacks the substantial volume of traditional weapons needed to fight a larger military and has faced repeated shortages and delays in promised aid. Cheap, adaptable drones helped fill those gaps.\n\nThe US is not in the same position. With advanced airpower and other high-end systems supporting operations, the Army approaches drone warfare differently, integrating drones rather than relying on them as substitutes for other capabilities.\n\nThat said, the Army sees the potential and plans to buy at least one million drones within the next two to three years.\n\nIt also intends to grow the training program, which had its inaugural session in August, to teach more advanced tactics and complex scenarios and have graduates take their lessons back to their respective units and become trainers themselves.\n\nAmacker said that the goal is to teach drone warfare skills such that \"when we combine it with our full force of effects, it just complements everything we're doing. It makes us even more efficient and effective on the battlefield.\"",

    "description": "The jamming cut soldiers off from commanders and limited what they could see. They located the source and took it out with mortars.",
    "fullText": "Much like the war in Ukraine, future battlefields could be drowning in electronic interference, so the US Army stress-tested new command-and-control tech against that threat.\n\nThe need to maintain connections between command and deployed weapons and crews, or reestablish those links when they're lost, is shaping how soldiers train on the service's Next Generation Command and Control, a new software-driven system that's being developed for the Army.\n\nIn its most recent NGC2 exercise at Fort Carson, Colorado, the Army's 4th Infantry Division put it to the test against electronic warfare. Stressing the system proved difficult, the Army said, because it would \"heal itself.\" The service said it had to disable certain features to really test it.\n\nMaj. Gen. Patrick Ellis, the commander of the 4th ID, said during a media roundtable that after they activated the jamming, the system rerouted internally to keep functioning. \"We had to go back and figure out something else to turn off to actually stress the system to feel that for real,\" he said.\n\nThat further testing saw soldiers in the field lose their connection to satellite services, forcing them to resort to backups like radio for communications while they searched for the source of the jamming.\n\nOnce they found it, they eliminated it with a mortar strike and started the reconnection process.\n\n\"It was quite seamless,\" said Lt. Col. Shawn Scott, commander of the 4th Squadron, 10th Cavalry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, speaking during the roundtable. He added that troops still had to learn how to manage retransmission in complex terrain — an important step in restoring communications when troops are spread out across a wide area.\n\nThe recent exercise put soldiers in a \"denied, degraded, intermittent, and limited\" environment, Scott said, cutting them off from the division's cloud but still allowing the squadron to track the fight and carry out its mission on its own. Once the simulated jamming was removed, \"we were able to reestablish connection back with division and brigade,\" he said, watching data flow back up the chain and back down again \"seamlessly.\"\n\nRussia's war against Ukraine has shown the US military that consistent jamming of communications, weaponry, and intelligence and surveillance capabilities is something it'll need to be prepared for in a future conflict.\n\n\"We don't think the modern battlefield's going to be free of electromagnetic interference,\" Ellis said.\n\nIn this round of testing, the Army fired 155mm rounds from an M777 howitzer at a Marine-provided target. The data from those strikes was then sent back to Marine Corps systems. During the exercise, 20 different types of sensors fed information into NGC2, including drones, electronic warfare systems, and Stryker vehicles.\n\nNGC2 is a major modernization initiative for the Army, changing how soldiers communicate with each other and command, receive intelligence, track locations, and plan warfighting actions like firing artillery or scouting with drones.\n\nJoe Welch, who oversees the Army's command-and-control systems and efforts to counter enemy communications, said that most NGC2 parts are built using off-the-shelf technology and standard commercial software practices, rather than bespoke military-only systems.\n\nData and artificial intelligence capabilities are giving soldiers real-time information, like how much ammo they have left or whether there are casualties to care for, and predictive simulations for what they'll need should enemy forces attack them. The testing at Fort Carson, led by Anduril and an industry team, is continually bringing in more vendors, capabilities, and functions to broaden what NGC2 can do.\n\nWith the new system, the Army is also recognizing what different divisions across the service will need out of it. The process has been driven by implementing soldier feedback quickly, sometimes overnight or within a few days.\n\nIn Hawaii, the Army's 25th Infantry Division is working on a data and applications component of NGC2 led by Lockheed Martin and other companies that, once completed, will also be implemented into what the 4th ID is doing.\n\nFuture exercises are expected to expand what NGC2 can do. One event in May, for instance, will test it against a simulated enemy.\n\n\"We're going to really tests the systems,\" Ellis said, including against cyber, electronic, and kinetic areas to see what vulnerabilities exist. \"We're going to go after all that to learn where we need to make some adjustments.\"",

    "description": "The US Army wants AI to help streamline some of its most tedious tasks for recruiters and logisticians.",
    "fullText": "The US Army's biggest AI gamble may not be on autonomous weapons, but instead whether Silicon Valley software can tackle the service's most tedious and, more often than not, grueling administrative jobs.\n\nThink less uncrewed aircraft and more behind-the-scenes tasks like recruiting, equipment maintenance, and endless gear inventories. Through a mix of new tools, redesigned workflows, and data integration, logisticians and data specialists are experimenting in hopes of modernizing how the largest military branch functions, a herculean effort leaders believe can cut the manual processes that have frustrated soldiers for decades.\n\n\"AI is kind of the tip of the iceberg, and you've got the rest of the thing underneath the waterline to make the Army go,\" David Markowitz, the Army's chief data officer and analytics officer, told Business Insider, speaking of the sprawling, multi-billion-dollar transformative effort.\n\nIt's not yet clear which experiments will ultimately succeed across the service. But improvements could be coming for some of the most hands-on, human endeavors. \"No one knows how to best change than the folks who deal with the work every day,\" Markowitz said.\n\nBusiness Insider visited the Arlington, Va., office where, every few months, dozens of soldiers meet with civilian engineers to test and refine a new customer relationship management system built on a Salesforce platform. If fielded, the system may dramatically simplify the burden for Army's recruiters — a job widely seen inside the Army as one of the most exhausting and burnout-prone assignments.\n\nToday, recruiters are bogged down by outdated processes.\n\nRecruiters are still expected to manually enter each potential recruit's information during every interaction, using a system that lacks the kind of easy interface that most Americans take for granted on their phones. The waivers many recruits need for fitness issues, test scores, or legal run-ins are another hassle that the Army believes AI could help simplify.\n\nA year ago, the service examined how much \"toil\" comes with enlisting a young person, said Alex Miller, who serves as the Army's chief technology officer.\n\n\"We found that there were thousands of individual pieces of information that they have to provide and most of them are repetitive,\" he said of the needed paperwork. Tasks as simple as copying down names and addresses by hand cumulatively suck up hours of precious time.\n\nA small group of recruiters in the Midwest are testing early versions of the software, sending feedback to developers in near real time.\n\nThe test unit has slashed administrative forms from several hundred forms to less than ten, Miller said.\n\nChange could be coming sooner for the troops who keep the Army's equipment running.\n\nThe service is \"on the cusp\" of allowing soldiers to query maintenance and readiness data across the force using simple prompts, said Richard Martin, the director of supply chain logistics at Army Materiel Command.\n\nThat could dramatically reduce the time it takes to answer some of the most consequential questions that Army leaders face.\n\n\"How many of this fleet should I overhaul in the next three years to improve material readiness by 15%?\" Martin posed, explaining that in a few months, leaders will be able to enter that prompt and receive data-driven recommendations that feed directly into planning, budgeting, and overhaul decisions, offering greater predictability for logisticians.\n\nTake some of the Army's biggest — and most expensive — gear, like the M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, he said. \"Imagine if I could look across the fleet and type in a prompt that says, 'What brigade would benefit the most from 30 overhauled Bradleys?'\"\n\nRight now, it's nearly impossible to narrow down information to what's actually useful, similar to not being able to narrow an overflowing inbox to a single email, Miller, the chief technology officer, explained, or being given too many GPS routes when you just need a single good one. Most logistics data is managed on spreadsheets alone, siloed within units.\n\nThe system could also flag the Army's most problem-prone individual gear, such as some tanks that suck up millions in repair costs.\n\n\"This is the power of what we are building,\" Martin said. \"We're not there yet,\" he acknowledged. \"We're now in the position where we have the capability to ask those questions.\"\n\nThe Army and Marine Corps have struggled in recent years to maintain armored vehicle fleets amid shortages of spare parts and skilled maintainers. Officials say clearer, faster data could reduce the readiness quandaries that consume chains of command.\n\n\"It lets us start thinking very, very differently about how we're managing our fleets,\" Martin said.\n\nAt the lowest levels of logistics, AI might save soldiers hours of the most tedious work they do: Inventorying equipment by visually verifying serial numbers on everything from rifles and radios to generators and trucks.\n\nWhile private industry embraced electronic inventories years ago, most of the military still does it the old-fashioned way — on paper. It's a process that demands days of inspecting hard-to-reach serial numbers during monthly or quarterly checks.\n\nThese inspections carry real stakes for the lower-level troops handling inventory. Even simple mistakes, such as misplaced paperwork for an item shipped to a maintenance depot, can threaten careers.\n\n\"Imagine not having to legitimately look at every serial number on every rifle — but to open up a door, take an RFID scan, and know every single rifle is in its right place,\" Martin said of the reform effort.\n\nArmy officials acknowledged that none of these efforts is guaranteed to succeed across the force. Some equipment items are so small that keeping a barcode could be tricky.\n\nElsewhere, data quality remains uneven, adoption can be slow, and too many new tools can overwhelm users rather than help them. And some systems are so antiquated and essential, like the Army's pay and contracting systems, that they can't be easily updated.\n\nThe service is \"always in kind of a balancing act of what's the right mix and getting feedback,\" Markowitz said of the iterative efforts to field new technologies for troops to make jobs less punishing.\n\n\"We're in that kind of evolution stage.\"",

    "fullText": "The US Army's new drone school is teaching students that mastering drone warfare means knowing they're not always the right weapon to use.\n\nThe new Unmanned Advanced Lethality Course is designed to teach soldiers how to operate and be lethal with small drones, in an effort to catch up with potential adversaries' power.\n\nSoldiers learn to pilot and attack with drones during the three-week course at Fort Rucker, Alabama, that emphasizes making small drones lethal and using them to support traditional fire missions with artillery. In simulators and with drones, students learn how to spot artillery fire and to repair drones rapidly with 3D printing.\n\nMaj. Rachel Martin, the course director, told Business Insider that it is important to her that soldiers realize \"it is a tool with which to accomplish a mission, but it may not be the tool given a certain mission set.\"\n\nWhen to use a drone \"should be something that you plan out, and it shouldn't be a reactionary tactic.\" Instead, using a drone requires planning.\n\nThat choice is part of the training exercises, where students are taught that \"ultimately, drones are a tool, but there are other tools available to them,\" like .50 caliber machine guns and AT4 anti-tank weapons, Martin said.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine and other current conflicts pushed the US Army to start the course by demonstrating how powerful small drones can be and how they can change the roles of some soldiers.\n\n\"The eyes of the world are on the Russo-Ukrainian war and the tactics and equipment that are being utilized in that type of warfare. And in America, that is not a style of warfare that we're accustomed to,\" Martin said.\n\nDrones are used \n\nDrones have also reshaped soldiers' roles, taking over much of the reconnaissance that previously required scouts, and allow more soldiers to fire weapons with a range once limited to artillerymen.\n\nUltimately, with drones, Ukraine is creating battlefield tech and tactics that allies are keen to learn from.\n\nBut allies are unlikely to find themselves in the exact same position as Ukraine. Ukraine had little choice but to rely on drones: It lacked factories to produce enough artillery shells to take on Russia's much larger military, and it repeatedly suffered shortages on weapons from allies and restrictions on those weapons' use.\n\nDrones can be produced quickly and for far less than traditional weaponry like missiles, and Ukraine can make them itself rather than relying on allies.\n\nMartin described the Ukrainians as \"in a fight for their lives, and they're using what they have available to them because they don't have those layered assets that we are lucky to have in our country.\"\n\nShe said the war may have been very different if Ukraine had the same strengths as the US: \"I'd be very interested to see how that war would've shaken out if they had the same military industrial complex that we have currently at the start of their war.\"\n\n\"I think it would've been very different.\"\n\nBetter-provisioned Western militaries, like the US, would likely not need to rely as much on drones as Ukraine has, and are not investing in them as heavily.\n\nAnd there are warnings that they should actively avoid doing that. Justin Bronk, an air power expert at the UK's Royal United Services Institute, wrote last year that \"it would be a mistake\" for Western forces to replace their traditional firepower with cheap drone capabilites, saying the West would have far greater potential in deterring Russia by investing in its traditional strengths and filling in gaps there, like high-end air power that can give NATO forces control of the air, something Ukraine has been unable to achieve.\n\nThe West is also already far behind this kind of warfare compared to Russia, he said, so \"relying too heavily on drones plays into Russia's strengths.\"\n\nBut the West still needs to know how to fight in this kind of war, where surveillance enhances defense of troop positions but jeopardizes forward movement.\n\nMartin, who previously commanded a Gray Eagle drone company, said that while the Army has elite systems, like Apache helicopters and the Abrams tank, those may not always be the right tools to use when drones are involved.\n\n\"Those are relevant in certain parts of the battlefield and against certain adversaries, but not necessarily in every part of the battlefield and against all adversaries.\"\n\nMartin said the outsize power that small drones have shown in Ukraine, like cheap drones destroying weaponry worth millions of dollars, is a reason the US needs to learn this style of warfare.\n\nShe said that ultimately, Ukraine has shown \"that a small country with a small military and a small amount of money could fight a major superpower like Russia and still survive.\"\n\nThe course was motivated by seeing how, in Ukraine, using drones can be so much cheaper than missiles, and because by using them, \"you're not putting human lives in danger.\"\n\nShe said she teaches students about Operation Spiderweb, an attack where Ukraine sneaked more than 100 drones into Russian territory and close to air bases to destroy Russian aircraft, including strategic bombers.\n\nShe called it an \"eye-opening experience for the world\" that showed \"a small amount of money could be spent to destroy something at the strategic level that costs upwards of $7 million for Russia, which is already hurting financially for being in a prolonged war.\"\n\nThe Army is investing in drone warfare, with efforts including plans to buy one million drones within the next two to three years.\n\nThe course brings in students from across the Army, 28 in its inaugural session, including infantry soldiers, cavalry scouts, and some who already work on flying and repairing drones.\n\nThe training is growing. The course, which had its inaugural session in August, plans to introduce more advanced tactics and complex scenarios as it continues, with the aim being that graduates bring back expertise to their units and become trainers themselves.",

    "description": "NGC2 analyzes supply and maintenance needs, getting fixes to soldiers faster. The software also simulates how enemy attacks could influence logistics.",
    "fullText": "A new combat tool is helping the US Army predict what ammo, fuel, and supplies it'll need by gaming out how enemies might attack.\n\nThe change is speeding up and breaking down barriers within the logistics chain, with real-time data helping troops, commanders, and sustainment planners predict what's needed so that they don't get left waiting around for days only to find they're facing a critical supply shortage.\n\nLogistics is a central focus of the Army's broader push to modernize how it fights and sustains forces, and the effort is unfolding through the Next Generation Command and Control system, or NGC2. The system is being built through a series of exercises and tests, with each iteration pulling in more weapons, vehicles, sensors, and data streams to expand what it can do.\n\nAt an exercise happening right now at Fort Carson, Colorado, the Army and a team of industry partners, including Anduril, are expanding NGC2 to make supply chain data more accessible and predictive when it comes to what soldiers need to fight.\n\nWith the NGC2 software, \"it's no longer, 'Hey, operations, what is your next 24-hour plan or what's your next 48-hour plan?'\"James Craven, the NGC2 program director at Anduril, said at a media roundtable on Tuesday.\n\nInstead, operational plans are able to be quickly shaped off of logistics data and commander guidance and then stress-tested against simulated enemy actions.\n\nThose simulations allow planners to examine multiple scenarios, showing how demand for ammunition, fuel, maintenance, or medical support could change depending on what an adversary does. The longer-term aim, Craven said, is to make the system accessible across the service and to key partners, allowing suppliers to estimate future demand earlier.\n\nWith NGC2, \"we can see magazine depth, consumption rates, and how those change over time, in real time,\" Craven said, and then that data can be analyzed thanks to artificial intelligence and machine learning to estimate the downstream effects on operations.\n\nThe Army says that the data-driven model is meant to replace its largely reactive supply system, where sustainment units often respond only after shortages appear. It's a dynamic that, as Army logistics leader Lt. Gen. Michelle Donahue recently warned, can delay support and leave front-line units short.\n\nThe software also tracks the status of equipment, vehicles, and weapons, using that data to predict maintenance needs and potential failures. The idea is to flag issues before systems break down, allowing maintenance crews to intervene earlier and reduce operational disruptions.\n\nAs the Army and its defense industry partners have been building the NGC2 system, they've been incorporating soldier feedback for quick fixes, sometimes implementing them overnight or within days. Service officials have said it's a major change from the past, where feedback became real change months or years later.\n\nTom Keane, Anduril's senior vice president and head of the connected warfare division, said on Tuesday that in general, new or upgraded capabilities are provided at least weekly, sometimes daily or hourly, depending on what's being worked on.\n\nNGC2 is a key example of how the Army is prioritizing agile, adaptive weapons development and the adoption of a Silicon Valley-style of work that's faster and more software-based than how the service has typically done business. The command and control system also represents a different relationship between the Army and its industry partners that the service says has led to a more iterative design approach.",

    "description": "The US Army's attempt to catch up on drone warfare isn't just teaching piloting skills but also training soldiers for the psychological struggle.",
    "fullText": "The US Army's attempt to catch up on drone warfare is teaching soldiers what it feels like to be hunted.\n\nThe Unmanned Advanced Lethality Course is designed to help the US Army close gaps exposed by conflicts like Ukraine, where cheap, small drones have been reshaping how soldiers fight and survive, by teaching students how to operate small drones and understand how lethal they can be.\n\nBut it's not just the practical skills of piloting a drone that US troops need.\n\nMaj. Rachel Martin, the course director, told Business Insider that instructors deliberately use drones against students so they understand just \"what it's like to be hunted by another operator from an adversary force: what it sounds like, what it feels like, how often they need to displace in order to survive or not be observed.\"\n\nThat matters because \"the minute you're observed, you need to move,\" she said. \"What follows that is usually fires of some capacity,\" such as artillery.\n\nThe aim, she continued, is to simulate an enemy force actively searching for them and to test their reactions \"so they get used to one being hunted by the enemy.\"\n\nUkraine and other recent conflicts have shown the Army how inexpensive drones can be turned into effective weapons capable of destroying systems worth millions of dollars and how vulnerable forces can be without that experience, Martin said.\n\nPreparing for that kind of war requires a mindset shift for US troops long used to controlling the air and less accustomed to looking up. In a future fight, that advantage may not exist, meaning anything overhead has to be treated as a potential threat.\n\n\"That is something we need to teach and ingrain in every soldier,\" Martin said.\n\nAnd there's little time for soldiers to think through whether something is friend or foe, she said. By the time you hear the sound, it may already be coming for you.\n\nCarl Larson, a US veteran of the war in Iraq who had fought in Ukraine, said at a drone conference last year that the mass of drones on the battlefield is \"incredibly corrosive to your ability to conduct combat operations.\" He said they hurt morale and hinder the ability to move around.\n\nHe said that many of the drones are \"damn near undetectable,\" explaining that \"they come in hot at over a hundred miles an hour,\" which leaves soldiers feeling vulnerable at all times. It's exhausting for troops to be constantly on edge.\n\nMartin shared that she had been personally targeted by one-way drones in Iraq and said \"the psychological aspect of it is real.\"\n\nIf Ukraine is anything to go by, future fights may be on another level, and experts say the US military needs to be prepared.\n\n\"Psychologically speaking, this is not what the US military is used to because the US military is used to controlling the air,\" Samuel Bendett, a drone expert with the Center for Naval Analyses, told Business Insider. In Ukraine, drones \"roam that airspace and present just absolutely a horrendous threat to the forces below.\" Kyiv's forces have been adapting to that for over three years.\n\n\"You need to train for the situations where you are going to be stressed all the time. You are going to be looking up all the time. You won't be able to relax normally,\" he said, predicting that soldiers will be on alert for the sound of quadcopter drones, \"which is the new nightmare fuel.\"\n\nUkrainian soldiers have described skies so crowded with drones that they're unable to figure out which side they belong to, sometimes leading to orders to engage any drone they see.\n\nThat saturation makes it difficult to stay safe, even far from the front lines. Soldiers resort to tactics like building fake positions and digging deeper trenches to avoid detection. It also slows advances and complicates evacuating wounded troops.\n\nMartin said that a key lesson they are imparting to students as a result is that \"we can't be a static army.\"\n\nIn this kind of environment, \"mobility is survivability. So we're trying to teach that concept that you may be in the observation post for a few minutes and then you're going to have to move, either to survive or to get a better picture of what's happening forward of you.\"\n\nIt means feeding back to the rest of the Army that \"they can't stay in the same place for very long.\"\n\nPlans for the future of the training course, which held its inaugural three-week session in August, include introducing more advanced tactics and complex scenarios. The Army also hopes graduates will return to their units as trainers themselves, with Fort Rucker serving as a hub for advanced instruction and a model that units can adapt into their own qualification programs.",

    "description": "Tesla's car sales dropped 11% while Elon Musk pivots to unproven robots, losing the EV crown to BYD as investors question the risky strategy.",
    "fullText": "Tesla’s car business just posted its first-ever annual revenue decline, but Elon Musk claims salvation lies in robots that don’t exist yet. The company’s Q4 2025 earnings revealed a brutal reality: automotive revenues plummeted 11% year-over-year to $69.53 billion, while total vehicle deliveries dropped 8.6% to 1.636 million units. Meanwhile, BYD cruised past Tesla as the world’s top EV maker, selling 2.26 million vehicles compared to Tesla’s shrinking numbers.\n\nThe most telling stat? Europe, where Tesla’s sales cratered 37.2%—the worst performance among all automakers, even as the broader EV market grew. Your Tesla stock might have rebounded 4% post-earnings, but that’s mainly because Musk spent the call talking about anything except cars.\n\nMusk positions Tesla as a “physical AI company” banking on unproven robotics technology.\n\nInstead of addressing why customers increasingly choose cheaper alternatives, Musk doubled down on his AI pivot. Tesla pumped $2 billion into his separate venture xAI, promising mysterious “collaboration frameworks.” The star of this show? Optimus humanoid robots, which Musk claims will enter production before 2026 ends and reach public sales by 2027.\n\nHe’s calling it the “biggest product ever” with poverty-ending potential—basically the tech equivalent of promising world peace through household appliances. The Robotaxi program, once Tesla’s golden ticket to autonomy riches, has quietly stalled. Those “unsupervised” tests that generated headlines? They’ve vanished faster than a TikTok trend.\n\nDeclining sales across all markets expose the risks of chasing sci-fi dreams over current products.\n\nYour Cybertruck enthusiasm apparently wasn’t shared—sales dropped 48% as the angular pickup failed to capture mainstream appeal. “2025 marks the year Tesla lost the BEV crown to BYD… a 620,000-unit gap,” noted Howard Yu from IMD Business School.\n\nThis pivot represents Silicon Valley’s ultimate moonshot mentality: when your core business falters, promise revolutionary technology that’s perpetually “just around the corner.” Tesla’s betting shareholders will stay patient while competitors like BYD offer reliable, affordable EVs today. Whether Musk’s robot army materializes or becomes another Hyperloop-level distraction remains the trillion-dollar question keeping investors awake at night.\n\nFrom the coolest cars to the must-have gadgets, GadgetReview’s daily newsletter keeps you in the know.

    "description": "Ukrainian soldiers getting combat training from the UK are feeding back key modern warfare lessons that the British Army is adopting.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian soldiers were shocked to learn that anti-drone nets weren't standard for the British Army when they came over for combat training, a UK officer told Business Insider.\n\nLt. Col. Ben Irwin-Clark, the commanding officer of the 1st Battalion of the UK's Irish Guards — an infantry regiment with a long operational history — said he had never seen nets to stop drones used in his 20 years in the army.\n\n\"The Ukrainians were absolutely stunned,\" he said. For the Ukrainians, he shared, the view is \"well, of course you put nets over your positions because that's how you defend yourself.\"\n\nDrones have become ubiquitous in Ukraine and are behind most battlefield strikes, forcing both sides to protect personnel and weaponry from constant airborne threats.\n\nDefenses include low-cost options like nets, which can snag propellers and prevent drones from reaching their targets, be they soldiers or high-value equipment. Soldiers stretch the counter-drone nets over their fortified positions, weapon systems, and armored vehicles. The Ukrainians have also covered key roadways with netting to protect supply routes.\n\nUkrainians have been gathering up netting wherever they can find it to meet demand, even from the fishing villages of partner nations.\n\nThe Ukrainians told their British trainers they needed to get nets, and the UK military reacted fast, Irwin-Clark said.\n\n\"We went 'round every fishing port in the east of England asking for their old fishing nets,\" the officer shared, \"and we've now got hundreds and hundreds of meters of fishing nets, which we drape over positions when we conduct training.\"\n\n\"Are they exactly the right type of drone nets? Dunno,\" he said. \"But in terms of replicating it for training, that's the best we can do. It's entirely free, and it's a lesson we learned entirely from our Ukrainian brothers and sisters.\"\n\nHe said it was \"just one example\" of how Ukrainian front-line experience has shaped British training, with lessons passed on by soldiers arriving directly from combat and rapidly folded into UK doctrine.\n\nThe Irish Guards gained much of that insight during the deployment to Operation Interflex, the UK-led training program that has supported more than 62,000 Ukrainian soldiers, including both new recruits and combat veterans.\n\nSpeaking at a training demo recently attended by Business Insider, Irwin-Clark said that \"it's really inspiring working with the Ukrainians and training Ukrainians, and I think what I hadn't anticipated over a year ago when we started our stint on Interflex is how much we would learn.\"\n\nThe Operation Interflex training is meant to share Western and NATO doctrine with Ukrainian forces to help them fend off Russia's invasion. The exchange, however, has increasingly run both ways, with the UK armed forces modifying aspects of its own training based on Ukrainian input.\n\nUkraine is fighting a large-scale, high-intensity war against a major military power, something the UK and other Western forces have not experienced in decades. As a result, Ukrainian troops often have more recent, firsthand insight into what works, particularly in areas like drone warfare and trench fighting.\n\nBritish trainers say the dynamic works. Col. Boardman, the commanding officer for Operation Interflex, previously told Business Insider that there is a \"really rich mutual understanding going on\" and that the training \"ends up with the sum being much greater than the parts, which is really valuable for us.\" He spoke on the requirement that only his rank and last name be used.\n\nUkrainian soldiers, he said, might explain why a NATO-style tactic is likely to fail under real-world combat conditions and what they do instead. That knowledge is then combined with Western doctrine and used to refine training on both sides. The UK, for instance, adjusted its thinking on how trench battles are fought in response to Ukrainian combat experiences.\n\n\"We are learning an awful lot from our engagement with this war,\" Boardman said.\n\nHe said Ukraine places a lot of value on NATO and Western military doctrine because while \"they may have the current battle experience,\" the Ukrainians \"know that we have some of the history, some of the hard-won experience of this in the past.\"\n\nThe feedback shared during Operation Interflex also prompted the Irish Guards to make other changes, including investing heavily in drone warfare.\n\nIt has since created a new \"drone hub,\" the first of its kind in the British Army, where soldiers can repair drones and develop new ones, and train for drone warfare. It uses tech like 3D printing, a technology adopted on Ukrainian advice.\n\nIrwin-Clark said that out of the 300 people in the battalion, 78 are now pilots or instructors. Speaking at the training demonstration, he described drones as part of \"the future of warfare.\"\n\nOthers within the British Army have acknowledged Ukraine's help in developing the UK's drone warfare capabilities. Boardman, for example, highlighted drones as an area where Ukrainian troops have far more direct experience. \"They are very good at sharing the understanding with us,\" he said.",

    "title": "The Helicopter That Caused the Potomac Air Disaster",
    "description": "Two Army pilots went on an ill-conceived training mission. Within two hours, 67 people were dead.",
    "fullText": "This article was featured in New York’s One Great Story newsletter. \n\nOne year ago, on January 29, 2025, two Army pilots strapped into a Black Hawk helicopter for a training mission out of Fort Belvoir in eastern Virginia and, two hours later, flew it into an airliner that was approaching Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, killing all 67 aboard both aircraft. It was the deadliest air disaster in the United States in a quarter-century. Normally, in the aftermath of an air crash, government investigators take a year or more to issue a final report laying out the reasons the incident occurred. But in this case, the newly seated U.S. president, Donald Trump, held a press conference the next day and blamed the accident on the FAA’s DEI under the Biden and Obama administrations. “They actually came out with a directive, ‘too white,’” he claimed. “And we want the people that are competent.”\n\nIn the months that followed, major media outlets probed several real-world factors that contributed to the tragedy, including staffing shortages at FAA towers, an excess of traffic in the D.C. airspace, and the failure of the Black Hawk to broadcast its location over ADS-B — an automatic reporting system — before the collision. To address this final point, the Senate last month passed the bipartisan ROTOR Act, which would require all aircraft to use ADS-B — “a fitting way to honor the lives of those lost nearly one year ago over the Potomac River,” as bill co-sponsor Ted Cruz put it.\n\nAt a public meeting on Tuesday, the National Transport Safety Board laid out a list of recommended changes in response to the crash, criticizing the FAA for allowing helicopters to operate dangerously close to passenger planes and for allowing professional standards to slip at the control tower.\n\nWhat has gone unexamined in the public discussion of the crash, however, is why these particular pilots were on this mission in the first place, whether they were competent to do what they were trying to do, what adverse conditions they were facing, and who was in charge at the moment of impact. Ultimately, while systemic issues may have created conditions that were ripe for a fatal accident, it was human decision-making in the cockpit that was the immediate cause of this particular crash.\n\nThis account is based on documents from the National Transportation Board (NTSB) accident inquiry and interviews with aviation experts. It shows that, when we focus on the specific details and facts of a case, the cause can seem quite different from what a big-picture overview might indicate. And this, in turn, suggests different logical steps that should be taken to prevent such a tragedy from happening again.\n\nThe whine of the Blackhawk’s engine increased in pitch, and the whump-whump of its four rotor blades grew louder, as the matte-black aircraft lifted into the darkened sky above the single mile-long runway at Davison Army Airfield in Fairfax County, Virginia, about 25 miles southwest of Washington, D.C.\n\nThe UH-60, as it’s formally designated, is an 18,000-pound aircraft that entered service in 1979 as a tactical transport aircraft, used primarily for moving troops and equipment. This one belonged to Company B of the 12th Aviation Battalion, whose primary mission is to transport government VIPs, including Defense Department officials, members of Congress, and visiting dignitaries. Tonight’s flight would operate as PAT 25, for “Priority Air Transit.”\n\nBlack Hawks are typically flown by two pilots. The pilot in command, or PIC, sits in the right-hand seat. Tonight, that role was filled by 39-year-old chief warrant officer Andrew Eaves. Warrant officers rank between enlisted personnel and commissioned officers; it’s the warrant officers who carry out the lion’s share of a unit’s operational flying. When not flying VIPs, Eaves served as a flight instructor and a check pilot, providing periodic evaluation of the skills of other pilots. A native of Mississippi, he had 968 hours of flight experience and was considered a solid pilot by others in the unit.\n\nBefore he took off, Eaves’ commander had discussed the flight with him and admonished him to “not become too fixated on his evaluator role” and to remain “in control of the helicopter,” according to the NTSB investigation.\n\nHis mission was to give a check ride to Captain Rebecca Lobach, the pilot sitting in the left-hand seat. Lobach was a staff officer, meaning that her main role in the battalion was managerial. Nevertheless, she was expected to maintain her pilot qualifications and, to do so, had to undergo a number of annual proficiency checks. Tonight’s three-hour flight was intended to get Lobach her annual sign-off for basic flying skills and for the use of night-vision goggles, or NVGs. To accommodate that, the flight was taking off an hour and 20 minutes after sunset.\n\nBoth pilots wore AN/AVS-6(V)3 Night Vision Goggles, which look like opera glasses and clip onto the front of a pilot’s helmet. They gather ambient light, whether from the moon or stars or from man-made sources; intensify it; and display it through the lens of each element. The eyepiece doesn’t sit directly on the face but about an inch away, so the pilot can look down under it and see the instrument panel.\n\nNight-vision goggles have a narrow field of view, just 40 degrees compared to the 200-degree range of normal vision, which makes it harder for pilots to maintain full situational awareness. They have to pay attention to obstacles and other aircraft outside the window, and they also have to keep track of what the gauges on the panel in front them are saying: how fast they’re going, for instance, and how high. There’s a lot to process, and time is of the essence when you’re zooming along at 120 mph while lower than the tops of nearby buildings. To help with situational awareness, Eaves and Lobach were accompanied by a crew chief, Staff Sergeant Ryan O’Hara, sitting in a seat just behind the cockpit, where he would be able to help keep an eye out for trouble.\n\nThe helicopter turned to the south as it climbed, then flew along the eastern shore of the Potomac until the point where the river makes a big bend to the east. Eaves banked to the right and headed west toward the commuter suburb of Vicksburg, where the lights of house porches and street lamps seemed to twinkle as they fell in and out of the cover of the bare tree branches.\n\nPAT 25 followed the serpentine course of the Rapidan River through the hills and farm fields of the Piedmont. At this point, Eaves was not only the pilot in command, but also the pilot flying, meaning that he had his hands on the controls that guide the aircraft’s speed and direction and his feet on the rudder pedals that keep the helicopter “in trim” — that is, lined up with its direction of flight. Lobach played a supporting role, working the radio, keeping an eye out for obstacles and other traffic, and figuring out their location by referencing visible landmarks.\n\nLobach, 28, had been a pilot for four years. She’d been an ROTC cadet at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which she graduated from in 2019. Both her parents were doctors; she’d dreamed of a medical career but eventually realized that she couldn’t pursue one in the Army. According to her roommate, “She did not have a huge, massive passion” for aviation but chose it because it was the closest she could get to practicing medicine, under the circumstances. “She badly wanted to be a Black Hawk pilot because she wanted to be a medevac unit,” he told NTSB investigators. After she completed flight training at Fort Rucker, she was stationed at Fort Belvoir, where she joined the 12th Aviation Battalion and was put in charge of the oil-and-lubricants unit. One fellow pilot in the unit described her to the NTSB as “incredibly professional, very diligent and very thorough.”\n\nIn addition to her official duties, Lobach served as a volunteer social liaison at the White House, where she regularly represented the Army at Medal of Honor ceremonies and state dinners. She was both a fitness fanatic and a baker, known for providing fresh sourdough bread to her unit. She had started dabbling in real-estate investments and looked forward to moving in with her boyfriend of one year, another Army pilot with whom she talked about having “lots and lots of babies.” She was planning to leave the service in 2027 and had already applied for medical school at Mount Sinai. Helicopter flying was not something she intended to pursue.\n\nThough talented as a manager, she wasn’t much of a pilot. Helicopter flying is an extremely demanding feat of coordination and balance, akin to juggling and riding a unicycle at the same time. For Lobach, the difficulty was compounded by the fact that she had trained on highly automated, relatively easy-to-fly helicopters at Fort Rucker and then been assigned to an older aircraft, the Black Hawk L or “Lima” model, at Fort Belvoir. Unlike newer models, which can maintain their altitude on autopilot, the Lima requires constant care and attention, and Lobach struggled to master it. One instructor described her skills as “well below average,” noting that she had “lots of difficulties in the aircraft.” Three years before, she’d failed the night-vision evaluation she was taking tonight.\n\nBefore the flight, Eaves had told his girlfriend that he was concerned about Lobach’s capability as a pilot and that, skill-wise, she was “not where she should be.”\n\nIt’s not uncommon for pilots to struggle during the early phase of their career. But Lobach’s development had been particularly slow. In her five years in the service, she had accumulated just 454 hours of flight time, and she wasn’t clocking more very quickly. The Army requires officers in her role to fly at least 60 hours a year, but in the past 12 months, she’d flown only 56.7. Her superiors had made an exception for her because in March she’d had knee surgery for a sports injury, preventing her from flying for three months. The waiver made her technically qualified to fly, but it didn’t change the fact that she was rustier than pilots were normally allowed to become.\n\nIf she’d been keen on flying, she could have used every moment of this flight to hone her skills by taking the controls herself. But she was content to let Eaves do the flying during the first part of the trip.\n\nDrawing near to Greenhouse Airport, a small, private grass runway near a plant nursery, they navigated via an old-fashioned technique called pilotage, using landmarks and dead reckoning to find their way from point to point. Coming in for their first landing of the night, they were looking for the airstrip’s signature greenhouse complex.\n\nLobach: That large lit building may be part of it.\n\nEaves: It does look like a greenhouse, doesn’t it?\n\nLobach: Yeah, it does, doesn’t it? We can start slowing back.\n\nEaves: All right, slowing back.\n\nAs they circled around the runway, Eaves commented that the lighting of the greenhouse building was so intense that it was blinding in the NVGs, and Lobach agreed. Eaves positioned the helicopter a few hundred feet above the landing zone and asked Lobach to show him where it was. After she did so correctly, he told her to take the controls. This process followed a formalized set of acknowledgements to make sure that both parties understood who was in control of the aircraft.\n\nEaves: You’ve got the flight controls.\n\nAs Lobach eased the helicopter toward the ground, Eaves and Crew Chief O’Hara called out times from the landing checklist.\n\nO’Hara: Clear of obstacles on the left.\n\nLobach: Thank you. Coming forward.\n\nThey touched down. One minute and 42 seconds after passing control to Lobach, Eaves took it back again. As they sat on the ground with their rotor whirring, they discussed the fuel remaining aboard the aircraft and the direction they would travel in during the next segment of their flight. Finally, after six minutes, Eaves signaled that they were ready to take off again.\n\nEaves: Whenever you’re ready, ma’am.\n\nEaves’s deference to Lobach was symptomatic of what is known among psychologists as an “inverted authority gradient.” Although he was the pilot in command, both responsible for the flight and in a position of authority over others on it, Eaves held a lesser rank than Lobach and so in a broader context was her subordinate. In moments of high stress, this ambiguity can muddy the waters as to who is supposed to be making crucial decisions.\n\nEaves, Lobach, and O’Hara ran through their checklists, and Eaves eased the Black Hawk up into the night sky.\n\nThey headed north, bending to the east to avoid Culpeper Airport to their left. The scattering of lights beneath them was sparse as they passed over the rural foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Cruising at an altitude of 2,000 feet, the aircraft hit rough air.\n\nIt was a complaint Lobach continued to make throughout the night. A cold front was moving through the area, bringing winds that gusted up to 45 mph. The wind wasn’t dangerous, but it kept pushing the aircraft off its flight path and caused constant unexpected jerks. It was another stress factor in a night that already had plenty.\n\nTwo minutes later, Lobach declared that she was taking control of the aircraft. Eaves sounded surprised.\n\nLobach: I got the flight controls.\n\nEaves: Yup, you got flight controls.\n\nEaves: You do have flight controls. Sorry about that.\n\nLobach pointed out that they had descended below their intended altitude of 2,000 feet and were now at 1,600 feet. Eaves was confused, then realized that he had misread the altimeter display.\n\nThe fact that Eaves would make such a mistake is a reminder that, while he was a much more experienced and proficient pilot than Lobach, he, too, was a pilot with less than a thousand hours of flight time. In order to even start a career as an airline pilot in the U.S., you need a minimum of 1,500 hours.\n\nThe 12th Aviation Battalion is an elite unit with a glamorous and high-stakes mission: flying government officials and VIPs around in the nation’s capital. A decade ago, it was staffed by experienced aviators who would build flight time elsewhere before being transferred to the unit. But in recent years, it had begun accepting pilots straight out of flight school. “The unit is strapped for resources,” Lobach’s roommate told the NTSB. “They have struggled with staffing issues in general.”\n\nSimilar problems exist throughout Army aviation; the service has been having a hard time retaining its most experienced pilots and providing adequate flight time for those currently coming up through the ranks. Since 2011, the average number of hours flown per year by crewed Army aircraft has fallen from 302 to 198.\n\nLobach continued to fret about the wind, while Eaves seemed unfazed.\n\nLobach: Strong headwind right now.\n\nLobach: Uh, pretty strong headwind.\n\nShe pointed out that even though the airspeed indicator had the helicopter moving at 110 knots, the GPS was showing their groundspeed as 93 knots, implying a headwind of 17 knots or 20 mph.\n\nAfter Lobach again commented on how choppy the conditions were, Eaves took control back, just a minute and 48 seconds after he had relinquished it. In the first hour of flying time, Lobach had been operating the controls for a total of three and a half minutes.\n\nPAT 25 was skirting the edge of the busy restricted airspace around Dulles and Reagan, a three-dimensional imaginary blob 90 miles across with corridors cut through at low altitudes for helicopter traffic. It’s a complicated and busy environment that encompasses three major airports and three military airbases and is patrolled by military helicopters from three different branches of the military. Some transport VIPs, others hunt and intercept drones and aircraft that shouldn’t be in this highly sensitive space.\n\nTo be clear, there was no need for PAT 25 to be messing around in this airspace. All Lobach needed to do on this flight was demonstrate her proficiency with night-vision goggles and her skill at operating the aircraft. They could have done everything in the much quieter region around Greenhouse Airport, and other flight instructors routinely did. “I would go kind of west and south, for the most part,” says Austin Roth, a former instructor pilot in the 12th Aviation Battalion who flew with Eaves and even once gave him a check ride. “That was my preference.”\n\nAs they passed over the Civil War battlefield of Thoroughfare Gap, an alarm called a master caution went off, indicating that a control system for a tail fin was malfunctioning. If the situation worsened and the surface became stuck, the helicopter could crash. Lobach immediately started to run an emergency checklist. To their relief, they were able to reset the system without difficulty.\n\nOnce everything was sorted out, Eaves took a moment to critique her performance.\n\nEaves: “So how’s that supposed to look, ma’am?”\n\nLobach: “That EP [emergency checklist]?\n\nLobach realized that in her haste to resolve the issue, she’d skipped a preliminary step: pulling out a document called the flight reference card (FRC) and reading the action steps from it directly, rather than relying on memory.\n\nEaves: Yup. So, I mean, that’s the whole point of the FRC cards, right, is to get us away from doing those things automatically … ’cause we end up killing ourselves because we do something without confirming and verifying …\n\nLobach: Okay, thank you, yeah, you’re absolutely right. I sometimes forget that.\n\nSoon after, Lobach complained of lightheadedness.\n\nLobach: I don’t know about you, but I’m feeling a little dizzy, like, looking down and around with the winds or whatever it is, but not too bad.\n\nEaves: Roger. It is definitely windy. But a beautiful night other than that.\n\nThey were now at their maximum distance to the north from their home airfield at Fort Davison. To get back, they could either return the way they came, flying south and then east, or go the other way around Dulles and Reagan by flying east and then south. Doing the latter would necessitate cutting through the busiest part of the whole Washington airspace, using the river routes that thread between Reagan National Airport and the National Mall.\n\nThat’s what Eaves chose to do. As they were turning east, Lobach decided that she was ready to fly the helicopter.\n\nLobach: Would you be up for me flying for a little while?\n\nEaves: Yup, by all means, ma’am.\n\nTheir next landing spot was a helipad located at the Federal Support Center, an underground facility located at a former Nike missile-launch site in Olney, Maryland. As they drew near, Eaves prepped Lobach for their arrival. As usual, they would fly to a pre-chosen waypoint, known as a release point (RP), then decelerate and descend to a touchdown in the landing zone. Now that the wind was at their back, it was pushing them to a higher groundspeed than their airspeed, meaning that they had less time to plan and react as they maneuvered for landing.\n\nEaves: All right, you’re 1.4 [kilometers] to your RP.\n\nLobach: Okay. Slow down, come down a bit. Wow, that’s wild! I’m slowing down and still at a hundred knots ground.\n\nEaves: 0.7 [kilometers]. What’s your RP?\n\nLobach: Um, I’m sorry — what do you mean, “What was it?”\n\nEaves: All right, what am I looking for on the ground?\n\nLobach: Um, I can’t remember, I have to look at my notes.\n\nEaves told her not to worry about her notes, which told her how to visually identify their landing spot, and instead to simply follow her navigational instruments, which had been programmed with the waypoint’s coordinates.\n\nAs they descended, Eaves and O’Hara called out items on the pre-landing checklist. Lobach commented that she could feel the strong, gusty wind pushing on the left side of the aircraft. Both she and Eaves were scanning ahead, looking for the helipad amid the trees and buildings below them. Eaves spotted it first, then Lobach. But as she maneuvered to come in for a landing to the north, she lost track of it.\n\nEaves: Remember, there is a fence on the north side of this pad.\n\nLobach: Yeah. Thank you … probably still coming in a little too fast. Not so bad. See that big tree on the right? Am I clear of that?\n\nSuddenly, the landing was not looking so good, and Eaves told her to abort.\n\nEaves: Go around! Go around! Go around!\n\nLobach added power and climbed away from the terrain. As she did, building airspeed, she put the helicopter into a banked turn.\n\nEaves: Are you going — which way are you going, ma’am?\n\nLobach: I was going to go right, sorry, do you want me to go left?\n\nEaves: I think it would probably be better, because you’re turning into the wind, right?\n\nThe idea of a go-around is to climb in order to come around and try landing again, but Lobach was starting to feel sketched out.\n\nLobach: I’m not sure I’m, I’m —\n\nLobach: This doesn’t feel right.\n\nEaves: Yup. You’re good. Feels like you’re getting your ass kicked with some wind to the left, right?\n\nEaves: So go ahead and start your approach.\n\nEaves coached her to add power and get the aircraft back in position to try landing again.\n\nLobach: Yeah, I — I’m not comfortable landing there.\n\nLobach: I’m clearing out. I probably could, but — it’s handling funny.\n\nEaves: All right. Mind if I give it a shot?\n\nEaves took the controls and landed the helicopter. On the ground, he talked her through how to handle the tricky winds and offered her a chance to try again.\n\nLobach: Yeah, honestly — I, uh, when we got to the … at that point, that’s probably, like, where I was like, Yeah, I don’t want to do this, ’cause I can’t really see it, like maybe I need to be higher in my chair or something, but I kind of lost any … Yeah, I’m good with the demonstration.\n\nEaves had no objections, and they decided to head back to base. By failing to complete the maneuver as requested, Lobach had effectively failed the check ride. Once back at their home base, Eaves would have to give her a rating of “unsatisfactory,” and Lobach would be put on training status until she was able to demonstrate the necessary proficiency.\n\nBut as they continued their mission, neither mentioned that fact.\n\nTheir course south took them across the wealthy Maryland suburbs of Bethesda and Cabin John, passing over golf courses, nature preserves, and tracts of expensive homes as they headed for the Potomac.\n\nFour minutes after takeoff, perhaps to show that she was not intimidated by the aircraft, Lobach again asked to take the controls. She would have them for the rest of the flight.\n\nPilots who are rusty or lack experience do not have the muscle memory that more skilled pilots possess. When too much information is flooding in at once, they are unable to process it all and become what psychologists call “task saturated.” Among aviators, the condition is known as being “behind the plane.” In this state pilots, are unable to plan ahead to anticipate problems. They respond reactively or simply miss cues altogether. They are not, in other words, fully in control of the aircraft.\n\nReaching the Potomac again at Cabin John, she was too high — 1,400 feet instead of the max altitude of 1,300 — and turned right instead of left, nearly putting the helicopter into forbidden airspace. Rather than taking control of the aircraft back from her, Eaves gently teased her. She pulled a 180, descending as she entered Route 1, a flight corridor along the Potomac’s northern shore.\n\nYou could think of these D.C. helicopter routes as tunnels through the otherwise forbidden airspace. They have a defined ceiling that gets lower and lower as you get closer to the center of the city but no defined lateral boundaries; instead, pilots are instructed to follow the bank of the river. That may seem a little vague, but pilots understand how to do it.\n\n“When I flew those routes, especially at night, I always flew them right on the bank,” says Tim Lilley, a former Army pilot who operated Black Hawks in the D.C. metro area. “One of the reasons is it’s very much easier to tell if you’re gaining or losing altitude, looking at trees and rocks and whatever is on the bank, as opposed to looking at water. If you’re looking at water, there’s no contrast, so you don’t know if you’re climbing or descending unless you look at your instruments. It’s a very bad idea to fly just flat over water at 200 feet, because you’re going to have to spend a lot of time looking inside to make sure you’re at the right altitude. You could very quickly lose 200 feet and end up in the drink.”\n\nAs she flew down the river, Lobach was clearly struggling to stay in control of the aircraft. Eaves nudged her to keep the helicopter in trim and to find the correct altitude.\n\nAt 8:43, as they passed one of the most sensitive and restricted airspaces in the world — the vice-president’s residence at the Naval Observatory — Lobach again complained about the turbulence.\n\nLobach: Getting choppy close to the ground.\n\nEaves: Oh yeah, down low it’s definitely gonna get choppy.\n\nLobach: Yeah. We’re at 300 [feet altitude].\n\nThat was not correct, as Eaves indirectly reminded her.\n\nLobach descended, but the ceiling of the corridor was decreasing as well, so she needed to come down further still.\n\nEaves: All right, there’s 300 for 200.\n\nBut she was not at 200 feet. As she passed the Lincoln Memorial, she was above 300 feet and, in fact, had begun climbing. She had also let the aircraft get out of trim, so that the helicopter was flying somewhat sideways to the wind. Novice pilots who are fixated on one of the numerous aspects of their flight — altitude, location, speed, communication with air-traffic control — can easily lose track of the trim. But it’s an important part of good airmanship, especially during turns.\n\nSouth of the Lincoln Memorial, the helicopter route bends east to cross the Tidal Basin and follows a side branch, the Washington Channel, which is occupied by a small marina. Staying on track required a sharp turn to the left.\n\nEaves: Lots of right pedal, ma’am.\n\nEaves: There we go, now we can make the turn.\n\nHe noticed that, in the process of getting the helicopter to fly straight, she had lost track of her altitude and gotten too high again.\n\nEaves: You’re at 300 feet. Come down for me.\n\nLobach stopped climbing and brought the helicopter into a sharp, short descent, but still remained above the route ceiling.\n\nAs PAT 25 was working its way southeast along Route 1, a regional jet inbound from Wichita was coming up the river from the south, heading for runway 33 at Reagan. Operated by a subsidiary of American Airlines, PSA Airlines flight 5342 was a Bombardier CRJ700 with four crewmembers and 60 passengers, including a group of teenage figure skaters, coaches, and parents returning from the national figure-skating championships.\n\nPAT 25’s path along the east bank of the Potomac would take it right under the designated flight path for jets landing on runway 33. Technically, if neither the helicopter nor the plane deviated from its assigned route, they would pass each other safely, but the margin was so small — just 75 feet at the point of closest approach — that the air-traffic controller at Reagan’s tower called PAT 25 to alert it.\n\nReagan Tower: PAT 25, traffic just south of Wilson Bridge is a CRJ at 1,200 feet for runway 33.\n\nThe primary job of an air-traffic controller is to keep aircraft from colliding. Given that two aircraft on the controller’s screen were now on a converging course, it was crucial to ensure that their paths did not intersect. A commonly used option was to hold southbound helicopter traffic at Hains Point, where the Washington Channel rejoins the main channel of the Potomac, until the landing plane had passed. Instead, Eaves assured the tower that he could see the incoming flight and asked for permission to stay clear of it under his own cognizance.\n\nEaves: PAT 25 has the traffic in sight. Request visual separation.\n\nReagan Tower: Separation approved.\n\nEaves did not have PSA 5342 in sight. As he looked to the south, the airliner would have appeared as one of a string of bright-white dots strung above the horizon. Some commentators have speculated that Eaves had another aircraft in sight, which he mistakenly believed to be PSA 5342. But it may have been that he didn’t have any aircraft in sight at all. During an interview with NTSB investigators, Army Chief Warrant Officer David Van Vechten testified that it was common practice for pilots in the 12th Aviation Battalion to say that they had the traffic in sight even when they didn’t, so that the tower would give them the visual separation clearance. “I’ve done that,” Van Vechten said. “I know if I don’t say it, I may have to hold.”\n\nAs they approached Hains Point, Eaves noted that the wind was pushing them, from behind and from the side, toward the eastern bank. To stay on course, Lobach would have to counteract that push by angling the helicopter to the right.\n\nLobach: Crabbing … better not to fight the wind. Right pedal.\n\nFifty seconds later, PAT 25 rejoined the main channel of the Potomac at Hains Point. The lights of Reagan Airport lay a half mile to the right. The PSA flight was a mile and a half away, dead ahead, on a converging course, and closing at a speed of more than 200 mph.\n\nIn the aftermath of the crash, investigators focused on the staffing level at the Reagan tower, concerned that an overburdened controller had mistakenly allowed the aircraft to converge, but the transcript shows that the close approach of the jet and the helicopter was front-of-mind for him. As the distance between the aircraft closed, he checked in with the Black Hawk.\n\nReagan Tower: PAT 25, you have the CRJ in sight? PAT 25 pass behind the CRJ.\n\nEaves: PAT 25 has aircraft in sight. Request visual separation.\n\nReagan Tower: Visual separation.\n\nFlying south from Hains Point, Lobach should have eased to the left to join the bank of the Potomac. Instead, she headed straight down the center of the river. Out here over the water, the river was just a black void. The only way to gauge how high she was was to look at the altimeter inside the cockpit. But that meant not looking outside at what was in front of her.\n\nLikely, she was still task saturated: trying to keep the helicopter at the right altitude, and along the right path, while wrestling with turbulence and a gusty wind that was pushing her toward the river bank on her left, all while wearing night-vision goggles that blocked her peripheral vision and overwhelmed her eyes with too much light. In this environment, with all the lights of the city around her, it would actually have been much easier to see with the goggles off, but that would have defeated the purpose of the mission.\n\nIn a word, Lobach was flailing. Eaves was as well, too distracted by his runaway student pilot to pay attention to what was happening outside the cockpit.\n\nEaves: All right, kinda come left for me, ma’am. I think that’s why he’s asking.\n\nLobach did not turn toward the eastern bank.\n\nAt 8:47:57.7, the helicopter’s black box recorded Lobach making a “sound similar to mumbling.”\n\nThe Blackhawk helicopter was flying at an altitude of 278 feet and a speed of 120 mph. It was both too far out from the riverbank and too high, which put it squarely in the path of the CRJ descending at 128 mph.\n\nOne second before impact, the CRJ’s flight crew tried to pull the airplane up. The helicopter’s main rotor hit the nose and engines of the airliner, triggering a fireball, and the commingled wreckage fell vertically into the Potomac River. The impact would have been unsurvivable for anyone onboard.\n\nWhat Lobach faced on the final night of her life was a mission that was far beyond her skill level. She was a low-proficiency pilot with a low aptitude for flying, one who didn’t fly regularly in an operational role and had no intention of flying after leaving the service. She was operating a helicopter that was older, less automated, and more challenging than what she’d trained on. Her instructor pilot had been warned to keep a tight rein on her during the flight but had failed to do so.\n\nAs the pilot in command, Eaves bears personal responsibility for what happened. But responsibility was not his alone. The crash was also a product of a dysfunctional system. For years, the Army air-accident rate has been climbing, as aviators complain that they are not being given enough flight time to maintain adequate levels of skill.\n\n“Across a lot of Army aviation units … what we’re seeing is that composite cockpit time is steadily going down and down and down,” said NTSB Chairman Jennifer Homendy during a hearing into the accident. “Five years ago, we would have thousands of hours cockpit. Now, we have hundreds and hundreds of hours cockpit … Experience across aviation formations is steadily decreasing.”\n\nIt’s striking that this decrease is even being felt at the 12th Aviation Battalion, whose mission is to transport the legislators who make Defense spending decisions and the Pentagon brass who implement those decisions. You’d think that they’d want their lives entrusted to only the most skilled pilots. The fate of PAT 25 shows that the unit can’t even be trusted to transport itself. “At her flight time of 460-something hours, if you’re not flying once a week, you are not proficient,” says Tim Lilley, the former Army Black Hawk pilot. “Certainly not proficient enough to fly high-ranking officials.” Yet the Army considered Lobach qualified to do just that.\n\nAfter Lilley retired from the military, he became an airline pilot, and eventually his son Samuel became an airline pilot, too. Samuel Lilley was serving as the first officer of PSA 5342 on the night of January 29, 2025. In the year since his death Tim has been on a mission to change the Army’s approach so that tragedies like this don’t happen again.\n\n“It was an embarrassment to Army aviation,” he says. “And you know, I still proudly wear my Army wings. But there’s a lot of things that have to be addressed.”\n\nOne thing he’d like to see happen is for the Army to establish a rigorous safety-reporting system of the kind that’s standard in commercial aviation. Another is to make sure that pilots get enough flying time to be proficient, even if that means taking staff officers off the roster entirely. “They have 14,000 active pilots. And I said to the Army Chief of Staff, ‘Wouldn’t you rather have 11,000 proficient pilots, rather than 14,000 pilots that are barely getting minimums?’”\n\nHe knows that it will be a hard journey to get there. Cultures don’t change easily. But a son’s death is a powerful motivator. As for Eaves and Lobach, he doesn’t blame them for his son’s death. He thinks that Lobach could have become a good pilot if they gave her another thousand hours of flying time. Instead, the Army withheld from her the training and flight time that she needed to fly safely and then required her to go fly anyway on a mission that was as ill-conceived as it was poorly executed.\n\n“There was no reason for them to be there,” he says. “This was a bad idea. A bad plan from the get-go.”",

    "fullText": "Syrian government forces have entered the vast al-Hol camp, which houses thousands of people linked to ISIL (ISIS), after the withdrawal of Kurdish forces who had been controlling the facility for years.\n\nArmoured vehicles carrying troops moved into the camp, located in the desert region of Hasakeh province, on Wednesday – a day after the Syrian government announced a four-day ceasefire with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).\n\nThe transfer of control of the camp, which houses some 24,000 people – mostly women and children linked to ISIL – came after two weeks of fighting between the army and the SDF that was brought to a halt by Tuesday’s truce.\n\nThe fighting has seen the SDF, which played a major role in defeating ISIL in alliance with a United States-led international coalition, lose swathes of north and east Syria.\n\nThe Kurdish forces had controlled the territories during the chaos of Syria’s civil war, which ended in December 2024 with the fall of former President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nThe government of President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Damascus has been pushing for Kurdish fighters to integrate into Syrian state institutions, as outlined under a March 2025 deal signed with SDF.\n\nTom Barrack, the US envoy to Syria, said in a statement on Tuesday that the SDF’s role as the primary anti-ISIL force had “largely expired” and that the government in Damascus is “both willing and positioned to take over security responsibilities”.\n\nYet despite this week’s truce, Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi reported from Aleppo province that renewed clashes on the outskirts of Kobani were reported on Wednesday.\n\n“We heard gunfire, we heard anti-aircraft fire from the Syrian military side, most likely trying to target drones. The situation is very, very tense,” Basravi said.\n\nSyria’s Defence Ministry said on Wednesday that seven soldiers were killed in a drone attack that it blamed on the SDF in the Hasakeh countryside, the country’s state-run SANA news agency reported.\n\nSANA said the attack targeted the Syrian army as its forces attempted to clear a facility previously used to manufacture explosives and drone munitions in northeastern Hasakeh, near the border with Iraq. It said seven soldiers were killed and 20 others wounded.\n\nEarlier this week, President al-Sharaa and SDF chief Mazloum Abdi had agreed that the Syrian state would take over responsibility for ISIL prisoners.\n\nAbdi on Tuesday urged the US-led coalition to “bear its responsibilities in protecting facilities” holding ISIL members.\n\nAl-Hol is the largest camp for people with links to ISIL, which was defeated in Syria in 2019.\n\nThe camp was established by Kurdish forces after they took control of swathes of Syria, with coalition backing.\n\nThose held at al-Hol include about 14,500 Syrians and nearly 3,000 Iraqis.\n\nSome 6,500 others, many of them loyal ISIL supporters who came from around the world to join the armed group, are separately held in a high-security section of the camp.\n\nThe SDF remains in control of the vast majority of more than a dozen prisons where some 9,000 members of ISIL have been held for years, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe largest facility, holding about 4,500 ISIL-linked detainees, is the Gweiran Prison, located in the city of Hasakeh, which is still under full control of the SDF.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Syrian Interior Ministry said 120 ISIL members escaped from the Shaddadi prison in Hasakeh province.\n\nThe army accused the SDF of releasing ISIL detainees from the facility, while the Kurds said they lost control of the facility after an attack by Damascus.\n\nSince then, many of the detainees who fled were captured by government troops who took control of the jail, state media reported.",

    "fullText": "Norway has issued thousands of letters to citizens warning that the army may have to seize their homes and vehicles if war breaks out with Russia.\n\nNorwegian military officials said the letters were an advance warning to those with assets that may need to be requisitioned.\n\nThe requisition policy covers vehicles, boats, machinery and property, and around 13,500 “preparatory requisitions” were issued on Monday, valid for one year.\n\n“The requisitions are intended to ensure that, in a wartime situation, the armed forces have access to the resources necessary for the defence of the country,” the Norwegian military said.\n\nThe letters will not have come as a shock to most recipients, as two thirds of them were simply renewing requisition notices from previous years.\n\nAnders Jernberg, the head of the military’s logistics organisation, said: “The importance of being prepared for crisis and war has increased dramatically in recent years.”\n\n“Norway is in the most serious security policy situation since the Second World War. Our society must be prepared for security policy crises and, in the worst case, war... we are undertaking a major build-up of military and civil preparedness,” he added.\n\nNorway plays a key role in Nato surveillance of the Arctic region, where the melting of the ice caps has created a scramble to secure new shipping routes and lucrative raw materials.\n\nThe Scandinavian country shares a maritime border – as well as a 123 mile-long land border – with Russia in the far northern Arctic region.\n\nRussia and China are seeking to expand their presence in the Arctic region, with the former building up old Soviet bases in the region and expanding its nuclear weapons stockpile on the Kola peninsula.\n\nThe requisition notices were issued amid an ongoing diplomatic crisis between the United States and Europe over president Donald Trump’s plans to annex Greenland, the minerals-rich Arctic island.\n\nMr Trump has cited Arctic security concerns as his main argument for annexing Greenland, an autonomous Danish overseas territory that is part of the Nato alliance.\n\nHe has threatened military action to take over the island, a step that would probably destroy the Western alliance even as it faces the growing risk of war with Russia.\n\nOn Monday, it emerged that Mr Trump also wants to take over Greenland because he is upset with Norway for refusing to give him a Nobel peace prize last year.\n\nDenmark and Greenland say the island is not for sale. They have the full support of Britain and the European Union.\n\nBut Sir Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister, said on Monday that he does not believe the United States is planning a military takeover of the island.\n\n“I don’t, actually. I think that this can be resolved and should be resolved through calm discussion, but with the application of the principles and values that I’ve set out in terms of who decides the future of Greenland, and making clear that the use of tariffs in this way is completely wrong,” he said.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Telegraph, Norway’s defence minister warned that Russia had recently launched a major expansion of its military bases in the Arctic region.\n\n“Russia is building up on the Kola peninsula ... where one of the largest arsenals of nuclear warheads in the world is located. They [the nuclear weapons] are not only pointed towards Norway, but towards the UK and over the pole towards Canada and the US,” Tore O. Sandvik told the Telegraph.\n\nMoscow is also trying to gain full control over the Arctic region in order to block Nato access to key shipping routes, he said.\n\n“We are the eyes and ears of Nato in this area, and we see that they’re testing new weapons, for example, hypersonic missiles, and they are testing nuclear-driven torpedoes and nuclear warheads,” he said.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "EL PASO, Texas (AP) — An immigrant from Nicaragua was found dead at a Texas immigration detention facility last week, federal officials said.\n\nVictor Manuel Diaz appears to have killed himself Wednesday at the sprawling tent complex at the U.S. Army's Fort Bill base in El Paso, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement. The federal investigation into his death continues.\n\nIt's the same facility where ICE said another detainee died earlier this month as staff members tried to keep him from killing himself. But a fellow detainee said at least five officers were restraining the handcuffed inmate and at least one had an arm around his neck.\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE — This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988.\n\nDiaz was swept up on Jan. 6 in the federal crackdown on immigration in Minnesota and sent to Texas, ICE said.\n\nDiaz entered the United States in March 2024 and Border Patrol officers took him into custody, He was released on parole pending a court date and a judge ordered him to leave the U.S. in an August hearing that Diaz did not attend, ICE said.\n\nDiaz was given a final order for removal on Jan. 12, two days before he was found unconscious in his room, authorities said.\n\nICE did not release any other details on Diaz's death. The agency notifies Congress and releases a statement on its website of all in-custody deaths.\n\nDiaz, 36, was being held at Camp Montana East where ICE said another detainee, Geraldo Lunas Campos, died as staff members tried to prevent him from killing himself.\n\nBut a preliminary investigation by the El Paso County Medical Examiner’s Office found Lunas Campos, 55, died from asphyxia from chest and neck compression and said the death would likely be classified a homicide.\n\nA fellow detainee told the AP that Lunas Campos was handcuffed and refused to go back into his cell when at least five guards pinned him to the floor. The detainee said at least one of the guards squeezed an arm around Lunas Campos' neck.\n\nICE said it is still investigating that death.",

    "description": "U.S. Army Reserve Black Hawk pilot Chris Busby, 28, and Stephanie Kenny-Velasquez, 25, went to an Austin courthouse to get their marriage certificate on Dec. 3.",
    "fullText": "U.S. Army Reserve Black Hawk pilot Chris Busby, 28, and Stephanie Kenny-Velasquez, 25, went to an Austin courthouse to get their marriage certificate on Dec. 3.\n\nRoughly 48 hours later, Velasquez entered a Houston Immigration and Customs Enforcement office for a routine check-in and never emerged, Busby said. The uncertainty has left the newlywed questioning whether his time serving the country was worth it, he said.\n\n“Stephanie is beautiful, she is smart, she’s amazing,” he said. “If it means sacrificing myself or my career to free her, I will do it.”\n\nBusby, who enlisted in the Army Reserve in 2015, has spent the last six weeks looking for ways to free his wife from detention. Despite his years of service and their recent nuptials, Velasquez was denied bond on Jan. 9, according to her lawyer.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment. The Department of Justice declined to comment on Velasquez’s case.\n\nVelasquez came to the United States in 2021 hoping to start a new life far from the violence and political instability of her native Venezuela. She does not have a criminal record and presented herself to immigration officials in Miami when she arrived in the country.\n\nIn the meantime, Velasquez, 25, settled into life in Austin. She picked up a job at a local car wash and took classes to get her real estate license.\n\nThe couple met in March and Busby, 28, immediately knew she was the one.\n\n“I’ve never met anyone like her,” he said. “She came here and just wanted to be the best.”\n\nTheir families had no idea that the couple planned to marry, and that’s how Busby said he wanted it. Busby said he was saving up money from his glass installation business to pay for a big wedding down the line.\n\nVelasquez had an asylum case pending at the time of her detention.\n\nHer brother, Oscar, described his younger sister as ambitious and driven. She hoped to start her own company one day and diligently saved money from working at the car wash and helping Busby with his window tinting business. She was studying for her real estate exam on the car ride to her immigration check-in, her husband said, adding that the test was scheduled for the following week.\n\n“She worked so hard for everything she had,” her brother said. “She was so happy.”\n\nBut on the day his sister was scheduled to check in with immigration officials, the family remained worried that Velasquez could be swept up in President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown despite her recent marriage and pending asylum case, he said.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have fled political repression and economic crisis in recent years, arriving in the United States seeking asylum or other legal protections like temporary protected status, or TPS.\n\nTrump moved to revoke TPS for many Venezuelans, which has been in place since 2023, and from other countries as part of his agenda to restrict immigration. That has been allowed to move forward while legal challenges to the action make their way through the courts.\n\n“We left to have a better future, more opportunities. Now if we go outside, we could be stopped by ICE,” Oscar said.\n\nLike other Venezuelans who have emigrated, Oscar said returning to Venezuela right now is unthinkable following the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. The country is far too dangerous and unstable for them to return, he said.\n\nVelasquez was transferred to the Montgomery Processing Center in Conroe, nearly three hours away from Austin. Since she entered detention her hair has thinned, Busby said. She sleeps fitfully in a bunk bed surrounded by 80 women, who share seven tablets to contact loved ones and lawyers, Busby said. They are allowed one visit per week and given food that is barely edible, he added.\n\nThe stress has taken a toll on Velasquez, according to her husband.\n\n“The girl is 25 years old. She should not be looking like she’s pushing 40,” Busby said.\n\nThe couple is now hoping for a Hail Mary in the form of the military’s Parole in Place program, which is intended to provide legal protections for spouses who lack U.S citizenship.\n\nBut the administration has slowly chipped away at the program, and a 2024 court ruling ended a Biden-era expansion called Keeping Families Together, which added stepchildren to the list of eligible relatives.\n\nA message on the initiative’s website said the Department of Homeland Security would no longer accept applications or adjudicate ones that were pending. The agency did not immediately respond to a request clarifying whether the Parole in Place program still applies to spouses.\n\n“I’m trying my hardest but there is so little I can do,” Busby said. “I just want her out of there.”\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "fullText": "BAGHDAD (AP) — U.S. forces have fully withdrawn from an air base in western Iraq in implementation of an agreement with the Iraqi government, Iraqi officials said Saturday.\n\nWashington and Baghdad agreed in 2024 to wind down a U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group in Iraq by September 2025, with U.S. forces departing bases where they had been stationed.\n\nHowever, a small unit of U.S. military advisers and support personnel remained. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani in October told journalists that the agreement originally stipulated a full pullout of U.S. forces from the Ain al-Asad air base in western Iraq by September. But “developments in Syria” since then required maintaining a “small unit” of between 250 and 350 advisers and security personnel at the base.\n\nNow all U.S. personnel have departed.\n\nIraqi Army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Abdul Amir Rashid Yarallah oversaw the assignment of tasks and duties to various military units at the base on Saturday following the withdrawal of U.S. forces and the Iraqi Army’s full assumption of control over the base, the military said in a statement.\n\nThe statement added that Yarallah “instructed relevant authorities to intensify efforts, enhance joint work, and coordinate between all units stationed at the base, while making full use of its capabilities and strategic location.”\n\nA Ministry of Defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly confirmed that all U.S. forces had departed the base and had also removed all American equipment from it.\n\nThere was no statement from the U.S. military on the withdrawal.\n\nU.S. forces have retained a presence in the semi-autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq and in neighboring Syria.\n\nThe departure of U.S. forces may strengthen the hand of the government in discussions around disarmament of non-state armed groups in the country, some of which have used the presence of U.S. troops as justification for keeping their own weapons.\n\nAl-Sudani said in a July interview with The Associated Press that once the coalition withdrawal is complete, “there will be no need or no justification for any group to carry weapons outside the scope of the state.”",

    "description": "An Iranian Kurdish separatist group in Iraq said it has launched attacks on Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard in recent days in retaliation for Tehran’s violent crackdown on protests.  Members of the National Army of Kurdistan, the armed wing of the Kurdistan Freedom Party, or PAK, have “played a role in the protests through both financial support and armed operations to defend protesters when needed,” Jwansher Rafati, a PAK representative, told The Associated Press on Thursday.",
    "fullText": "IRBIL, Iraq (AP) — An Iranian Kurdish separatist group in Iraq said it has launched attacks on Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard in recent days in retaliation for Tehran’s violent crackdown on protests.\n\nMembers of the National Army of Kurdistan, the armed wing of the Kurdistan Freedom Party, or PAK, have “played a role in the protests through both financial support and armed operations to defend protesters when needed,” Jwansher Rafati, a PAK representative, told The Associated Press on Thursday.\n\nIranian media has previously accused the group and other Kurdish factions of attacking security forces.\n\nIranian activists say more than 2,797 people were killed in the government’s crackdown on a recent wave of nationwide protests.\n\nA handful of Iranian Kurdish dissident or separatist groups — some with armed wings — have long found a safe haven in northern Iraq’s semiautonomous Kurdish region, where their presence has been a point of friction between the central government in Baghdad and Tehran.\n\nIran has occasionally launched strikes on the groups’ sites in Iraq but has not done so since the outbreak of the recent protests.\n\nThe PAK is the first of the groups to claim armed operations since the protests and crackdown began.\n\n“When we found out that the IRGC was shooting protesters directly, our fighters in Ilam, Kermanshah, and Firuzkuh responded with armed operations and inflicted significant damage on the regime’s forces,” Rafati said in an interview in Irbil, the capital of northern Iraq’s semiautonomous Kurdish region.\n\nThe PAK has also claimed a number of attacks online and posted video of what it said were operations against IRGC targets, sometimes accompanied by grainy videos showing gunshots or explosions and buildings ablaze. The AP was not able to confirm the extent of the damages or the impact of the attacks.\n\nRafati said the attacks were launched by members of the group’s National Army of Kurdistan military wing based inside Iran. The group had not sent any forces from Iraq, but it anticipates that Iran may strike PAK bases in Iraq in retaliation for its operations, he added.\n\nHe said the PAK has been providing support to dozens of Iranians who fled to the Kurdish area in Iraq since the crackdown on protests began.\n\nThe PAK claims may put Iraqi authorities in a sensitive situation with Tehran — which wields significant influence over its neighbor — concerning the group's ongoing presence in northern Iraq.\n\nIraq in 2023 reached an agreement with Iran to disarm Kurdish Iranian dissident groups and move them from their bases near the border areas into camps designated by Baghdad. The bases were shut down and movement within Iraq was restricted, but the groups have remained active.\n\nDuring the Israel-Iran war last year, the PAK and other Kurdish dissident groups began organizing politically in case the authorities in Tehran should lose their hold on power but did not launch armed operations.\n\nA PAK spokesperson told the AP at the time that premature armed mobilization could endanger the Kurdish groups and the fragile security of Kurdish areas, both in Iraq and across the border in Iran.\n\nA decade ago, PAK forces received training from the U.S. military when they were taking part in the fight against the Islamic State militant group after it swept across Iraq and Syria, seizing large swathes of territory.\n\nIronically, the PAK at the time found itself allied with Iran-backed Shiite Iraqi militias that were also fighting against IS.\n\nAt that time, the PAK received funding from Iraq's Kurdish regional government, but says now that most of its funding comes from its supporters in Iran and the diaspora.\n\nDuring the recent protests, Iranian state media has repeatedly referred to the demonstrators as “terrorists” and alleged they received support from America and Israel, without offering evidence to support the claim.\n\nIranian state television aired what appeared to be surveillance video of a group of men wearing the baggy pants common among the Kurds, firing pistols, in Iran’s western Kurdish region. It has also published images of seized weapons in the area.\n\nThe semiofficial Tasnim news agency, which is close to Iran's Revolutionary Guard, said Kurdish groups including the PAK “have played an active role in inciting these movements by issuing coordinated statements and messages.” It said that “groups based in northern Iraq have passed the stage of psychological warfare and media operations and have entered the field phase.”\n\nThe semiofficial Fars news agency, which is also close to the Revolutionary Guard, reported on Jan. 10 that another group — the Kurdistan Free Life Party, or PJAK — had killed eight Guard members in Kermanshah and that a PJAK sniper killed a police officer in Ilam province. PJAK has not claimed any armed operations during the protests.",

Gen.",
    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran's army chief threatened preemptive military action Wednesday over the “rhetoric” targeting the Islamic Republic, likely referring to U.S. President Donald Trump's warning that if Tehran “violently kills peaceful protesters,” the United States “will come to their rescue.\"\n\nThe comments by Maj. Gen. Amir Hatami come as Iran tries to respond to what it sees as a dual threat posed by Israel and the United States, as well as the protests sparked by its economic woes that have grown into a direct challenge to its theocracy.\n\nSeeking to halt the anger, Iran's government began Wednesday paying the equivalent of $7 a month to subsidize rising costs for dinner table essentials like rice, meat and pastas. Shopkeepers warn prices for items as basic as cooking oil likely will triple under pressure from the collapse of Iran's rial currency and the end of a preferential subsidized dollar-rial exchange rate for importers and manufacturers — likely fueling further popular anger.\n\n“More than a week of protests in Iran reflects not only worsening economic conditions, but longstanding anger at government repression and regime policies that have led to Iran’s global isolation,” the New York-based Soufan Center think tank said.\n\nHatami spoke to military academy students. He took over as commander in chief of Iran's army, known by the Farsi word \"Artesh,\" after Israel killed a number of the country's top military commanders in June's 12-day war. He is the first regular military officer in decades to hold a position long controlled by Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.\n\n“The Islamic Republic considers the intensification of such rhetoric against the Iranian nation as a threat and will not leave its continuation without a response,\" Hatami said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency.\n\nHe added, “I can say with confidence that today the readiness of Iran’s armed forces is far greater than before the war. If the enemy commits an error, it will face a more decisive response, and we will cut off the hand of any aggressor.”\n\nIranian officials, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have been responding to Trump's comments, which took on more significance after the U.S. military raid that seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a longtime ally of Tehran, over the weekend. But there's been no immediate public sign of Iran preparing for an attack in the region.\n\nIranian state television reported on the start of a new subsidy of the equivalent of $7, put into the bank accounts of heads of households across the country. More than 71 million people will receive the benefit, which is 10 million Iranian rials, it reported. The rial now trades at over 1.4 million to $1 and continues to depreciate.\n\nThe subsidy is more than double than the 4.5 million rial people previously received. But already, Iranian media report sharp rises in the cost of basic goods, including cooking oil, poultry and cheese, placing additional strain on households already burdened by international sanctions targeting the country and inflation.\n\nIran's vice president in charge of executive affairs, Mohammad Jafar Ghaempanah, told reporters on Wednesday that the country was in a “full-fledged economic war.” He called for “economic surgery” to eliminate rentier policies and corruption within the country.\n\nIran has faced rounds of nationwide protests in recent years. As sanctions tightened and Iran struggled after the June war with Israel, its rial currency sharply fell in December. Protests began soon after on Dec. 28. They reached their 11th day on Wednesday and didn't appear to be stopping.\n\nSocial media videos purported to show new cities like Bojnourd, Kerman, Rasht, Shiraz and Tabriz, as well some smaller towns, joining the demonstrations on Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency offered the latest death toll of 36 for the demonstrations. It said 30 protesters, four children and two members of Iran’s security forces have been killed. Demonstrations have reached over 310 locations in 28 of Iran’s 31 provinces. More than 2,100 people have been arrested, it said.\n\nThe group, which relies on an activist network inside of Iran for its reporting, has been accurate in past unrest.",

    "description": "Calum McFarlane’s Blue and White Army",
    "fullText": "Chelsea’s new head coach, Liam Rosenior is expected to be in attendance but will not leading the team just yet as the Blues make the short trip down the road to Craven Cottage, to take on friendly rivals Fulham. Instead of Rosenior, it will be interim head coach Calum McFarlane calling the shots, and hopefully just as effectively as he did over the weekend, when he engineered a very credible 1-1 draw away against Manchester City.\n\nAlas, the only team to truly benefit from that draw were Arsenal, who now have a six point lead at the top of the table, just past the halfway mark of the season.\n\nFor Chelsea, it’s now just one win in our last eight Premier League matches, collecting just eight points from the 24 on offer. Somehow we’re still in fifth, but we’re going to have to start picking up points if we want to remain in the Champions League places by season’s end.\n\nDate / Time: Wednesday, January 7, 19.30 GMT; 2:30pm EST; 1am IST (next day)\nVenue: Craven Cottage, SW6\nReferee: Peter Bankes (on pitch); John Brooks (VAR)\nForecast: Partly sunny and a slight breeze; no more snow sadly\n\nOn TV: Sky Sports Football (UK); none (USA); Star Sports Select HD2 (India); none (NGA); elsewhere\nStreaming: Sky Go (UK); Peacock (USA); JioHotstar (India); DStv Now, SuperSport GOtv (NGA)\n\nFulham team news: It’s been a decent festive period for midtable (as usual) Fulham, getting draws against Liverpool and Crystal Palace and wins against West Ham and Nottingham Forest. Their draw against Liverpool, last time out, saw both teams score in added-on time, with Fulham equalizing on a most unlikely Goal of the Season worldie from Harrison Reed: just his fourth goal in over 200 appearances for the club.\n\nHARRISON REED GOAL FROM ALL OF THE ANGLES WHAT A GOAL 😮‍💨👏🏻pic.twitter.com/DZGfsF6Srw\n\n— KinG £ (@xKGx__) January 4, 2026\n\nAnd they’ve done all that despite losing a trio of key players to Nigeria at the Africa Cup of Nations (Alex Iwobi, Calvin Bassey, and Samuel Chukwueze), and missing a few others through injury (Josh King, Kenny Tete, and Rodrigo Muniz). In better news for them, Ryan Sessegnon looks set to return from a hamstring problem.\n\nManager Marco Silva is weary of the mental and physical tolls these games have taken on his players, though such concerns can fall by the wayside when it comes to special derbies (even friendly ones), especially when one side may feel wronged by a certain decision (i.e. Josh King’s goal getting ruled in the reverse fixture at the Bridge earlier this season).\n\n“It’s special. It’s special, because we know what’s happened. […] It really hurt ourselves, our fans, this football club, the way we were not able to win the game at Stamford Bridge. The way the team performed almost perfectly first half, in a really tough game against a top, top side, the way the team performed, and everything that happened in that game, really hurt this football club. I’m not talking about one or two persons, or just the players – us, the football club, the way that things happened that Saturday morning.\n\n“It is what it is – now it’s another opportunity for us to enjoy, to embrace a big challenge with our fans to play a derby like a derby should be played. Simple as that. It’s a new game, a new story. I don’t want anyone to think about the past, we have to look for the future, and what’s going to be most important is the next one. It’s a special game.”\n\n-Marco Silva; \n\nChelsea team news: Robert Sánchez and Wesley Fofana were both late scratches over the weekend, with injury and illness, respectively, but they are both back in training and in contention to start. Same goes for Marc Cucurella, who’s barely ever injured, but has missed the last couple games with a hamstring concern. We also welcome back Moisés Caicedo from his latest suspension.\n\nLevi Colwill, Dário Essugo, and Roméo Lavia remain out. The club recently wished Mykhailo Mudryk a happy birthday on social media, so we should probably mention the suspended winger here as well. How’s the appeals process going, Misha?\n\nMcFarlane will be hoping to hand over the reigns to Rosenior with the team back on the right path.\n\n“[This is a] really talented group, young, hungry, have shown they can play at the top top level against top top sides. Anyone associated with the club should be proud of their performance on Sunday and moving forward, this team has massive, massive potential so we should all be excited.”\n\n-Calum McFarlane; \n\nPreviously: Last season, we went to Craven Cottage on a low and came back on an absolute high. Tyrique George’s late equalizer and Pedro Neto’s even-later winner galvanized the team into a scorching hot run of form and results, culminating in not only a top-four finish but winning the FIFA Club World Cup later that summer.",

    "description": "Popular German firearms maker Heckler & Koch didn't even compete.",
    "fullText": "The Bundeswehr, the German Armed Forces, has a history of fielding German-made firearms. After all, German firearms manufacturers are some of the best in the world, with Oberndorf-based Heckler & Koch being among the world’s largest manufacturers. With this in mind, it might be a bit of a surprise that the Bundeswehr announced the selection of the Czech-made CZ P-10C as the new German service pistol.\n\nPrevious Bundeswehr pistols include the Walter P38-derived P1 and the legendary H&K USP (as the P8), the A1 version of which is being replaced by the CZ as the P13. While the Germans have used foreign pistols in the past (including the ubiquitous Glock 17), the CZ P-10C represents the first adoption of a foreign pistol as a standard-issue sidearm. Interestingly, CZ’s competition in the final round was Austria’s Glock and Slovenia’s AREX, while H&K was not even in the running.\n\nOn Dec. 18, 2025, CZ announced that the company had “achieved one of the most significant milestones in its history” with the selection of the P-10C by the Bundeswehr. The specific model selected to serve as the P13 is the optics-ready version with a flat dark earth finish. Of course, the pistol is chambered in 9x19mm in accordance with NATO standardization… looking at you, M7 rifle.\n\nOtherwise, the P-10C is a fairly ordinary pistol by modern standards. It features a 4-inch barrel, a tilting barrel action, a short-recoil system, and is striker-fired. The pistol’s polymer frame includes an accessory rail and interchangeable backstraps, the barrel is cold-hammered forged, and the standard iron sights are night sights.\n\nFeeding from a standard 15-round magazine, the P-10C can also use CZ’s extended magazines, including the 17-round magazine, as well as magazines for the CZ P-07 pistol. The P-10C was adopted by the Army of the Czech Republic in 2020.\n\n“We are honored that the German Bundeswehr has chosen CZ as its partner. Our success in this rearmament tender is one of the most significant achievements in CZ’s modern history,” said CZ CEO Jan Zajic in a press release. “It clearly confirms the outstanding reputation our firearms have earned through active deployment in real combat conditions. We look forward to a long-term cooperation with the Bundeswehr and to fulfilling all its requirements in line with the contract.”\n\nNeither CZ nor the Bundeswehr announced the quantity or value of the P13 contract, nor did they provide a specific delivery timeline. However, the Bundeswehr has been undergoing an accelerated process of modernization since the 2022 full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. While sidearms do not contribute as much to combat power as artillery or rifles, the awarding of the P13 contract is still a significant step toward German military readiness.\n\nZhakfar Ahmadi, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty",

    "description": "A Pentagon watchdog says the Army and Navy misrepresented recruit test scores, exceeding federal limits on low scorers.",
    "fullText": "A new Pentagon Inspector General report says that the Army and Navy misrepresented the academic qualifications of some recruits, allowing both services to exceed federal limits on low-scoring enlistees.\n\nThe report, released earlier this month, is based on a yearlong review of the services' Future Soldier and Future Sailor preparatory courses, which are new \"pre-boot camps\" created in recent years.\n\nThe programs have helped the Army and Navy enlist more recruits amid a national recruiting crisis by taking applicants with low entrance exam scores or fitness shortfalls and aiming to prepare them for service — addressing the deficiencies — in a matter of weeks or months.\n\nThe Defense Department Inspector General found that the Army and Navy miscalculated the number of low-scoring recruits they enlisted by counting test scores earned after applicants completed the preparatory courses, rather than the scores they received before entering those programs.\n\nThat approach allowed both services to exceed federal limits on low-scoring recruits without notifying the Secretary of Defense, as required by the rule. The secretary has the authority to raise those limits, but must also inform Congress.\n\nThe Pentagon disputed the report's findings, arguing that the scores that should count are those earned at the end of the preparatory courses, not those taken beforehand.\n\n\"Improving a recruit's academic skills is a primary reason for creating the [Future Soldier and Future Sailor Preparatory Courses],\" William Fitzhugh, the acting assistant secretary of defense for manpower and reserve affairs, wrote in a memo to the inspector general. \"Improved academic skills, and the resulting AFQT scores, enable such recruits to pursue a broader range of occupations, which benefits them and the Military Services.\"\n\nFederal law caps the number of recruits who score low on the Armed Forces Qualification Test, known as Category IV applicants, at 4% of the total number of recruits who ship to boot camp each year. Category IV applicants score between the 10th and 30th percentiles on the exam, which assesses subjects such as reading comprehension, math, and mechanics.\n\nSuch recruits \"tend to exhibit below average trainability and on-the-job performance,\" the report said.\n\nThe cap is intended to ensure the services attract enough high-scoring recruits to fill technically demanding roles, such as cyber operations, intelligence, and special operations, as well as many logistics and administrative jobs that also require strong academic performance.\n\nHad the services used applicants' original test scores, the Navy would have classified more than 11% of its 2025 enlistments as Category IV recruits, compared with just over 7% when counting scores earned after the preparatory course. The Army also exceeded 10% of Category IV recruits, though the report did not say by how much.\n\nThe findings come as the Army and Navy begin to emerge from a yearslong recruiting crisis that left both services thousands of recruits short in recent years. Nearly three-quarters of American youth do not meet either the military's fitness or its academic requirements to qualify for service, and fewer than ever are likely to consider military careers, making innovative recruiting efforts critical.\n\nA previous inspector general report raised concerns about \"less restrictive testing standards\" in the Army's preparatory course and found that some participants struggled with English as a second language. The Pentagon also disputed those findings.",

    "fullText": "The person of interest detained in connection with the Brown University shooting, identified by law enforcement sources as Benjamin Erickson, is a decorated soldier who had served in a position at Arlington National Cemetery, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nErickson, a 24-year-old Wisconsin native, served as an infantry soldier in the US Army, where he passed sniper training, had experience with firearms instruction and had served as a rifleman between 2021 and 2024, according to the profile.\n\nErickson also received a good conduct medal, participated in “security duties” near the president and assisted with funeral ceremonies at Arlington, the profile stated.\n\nThe LinkedIn page stated he planned to continue his college education at Brown University in the fall 2025 semester.\n\nA spokesperson for the US Army said Erickson had no deployments and left last year with the rank of specialist. Brown University did not immediately respond to questions about Erickson’s record.\n\nAuthorities said the person of interest was not a current student at Brown, but law enforcement sources indicated to CNN that he might have been recently enrolled.\n\nErickson took online classes with a focus on psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee after graduating from high school in July 2020, and then transferred to Brown for this fall semester after his military service ended, according to the profile, which noted a variety of interests including animal welfare, veteran support and helping the poor.\n\nThe profile further noted that he had interned as a carpenter and helped out at a horse rescue center.\n\nA staff member at the rescue, the Gentle Giants Draft Horse Rescue in Maryland, told CNN that Erickson was part of an Army unit that learned horse handling techniques at the rescue center between 2023 and 2024. Erickson was training with the Caisson Detachment of the US Army’s 3d US Infantry Regiment, the staff member said – a unit that provides escorts for military and state funerals.\n\nA high school yearbook included a photo of Erickson on his school’s wrestling team. A profile on X that appeared to belong to Erickson posted in 2016 and 2017 about wrestling, music and political satire.\n\nOne of Erickson’s former high school classmates, Bryce Jankowski, said he recently exchanged texts with Erickson, who said he was studying at Brown.\n\n“He said he was doing good,” Jankowski said. “He said he was living at a hotel because his apartment flooded,” though he said that did not seem to bother him.\n\nJankowski described Erickson as a well-behaved, smart individual. He did not recall Erickson making any concerning statements, harboring extremist views or having any behavioral challenges. “He was wicked smart.”\n\nAfter high school, he said Erickson had told him that he was in sniper school with the US military.\n\nA former wrestling teammate from high school, who asked not to be quoted by name, described Erickson as a “pretty nice guy, he was quiet… he becomes really outgoing when you get to know him, but he’s pretty quiet when you don’t.”\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, CNN observed the FBI at a Wisconsin home owned by Erickson’s family.\n\nA search of court databases showed no clear criminal history for Erickson aside from a 2023 case in which he was cited for driving on a sidewalk, a charge that was dismissed.\n\nCNN’s Bill Kirkos, Thomas Bordeaux and Jeff Winter contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Is there nothing he can’t do? President Donald Trump has astounded viewers of the 126th Army-Navy football game with his unique approach to flipping a coin.\n\nWhile officiating the customary coin toss at the historic football clash at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, Maryland, Trump demonstrated a bizarre heaving motion that resulted in almost no actual flipping of the coin itself.\n\nTaking the coin with a pinched left hand, and placing it into the open palm of his right, the president heaved the coin forward, sending it in a feeble, plunging arc. Helpfully, he pointed out where the coin had landed after it hit the ground.\n\nViewers immediately expressed their surprise at this pioneering method of coin-based decision-making.\n\n“Donald Trump may have executed the single worst coin flip in history,” wrote former independent congressional candidate Hal Stewart. “That coin is headed to the hall of shame!”\n\n“President Trump with the unprecedented coin toss that doesn’t appear to flip at all,” wrote author and radio host Clay Travis.\n\n“Donald Trump flips a coin like a pansy,” added political commentator Ed Krassenstein.\n\nHowever, the shock and surprise may be unwarranted as Trump has form in this area. In fact, as he has previously demonstrated, the president appears to believe that this is exactly how coins are flipped.\n\nIn 2018, Trump demonstrated his idiosyncratic style at that year’s Army-Navy Game, drawing critical fire from then-MSNBC host Chris Hayes.\n\n“Why is everything with this president so weird and so awkward?” Hayes asked. “Flipping a coin is not some great feat of athletics.”\n\n“To flip a coin, you just have to, uh, flip the coin. You use the thumb, you flick it into the air, get a good rotation going, let it land on the ground, see if it’s heads or tails.”\n\nThe All In host described Trump’s efforts as how one might release a baby bird into the air.\n\nThe Army Black Knights correctly called the coin in Saturday’s game tails. That did not, however, help them win, as the Navy Shipmen beat them in a close 17-16 game.",
