    "description": "Tesla's car sales dropped 11% while Elon Musk pivots to unproven robots, losing the EV crown to BYD as investors question the risky strategy.",
    "fullText": "Tesla’s car business just posted its first-ever annual revenue decline, but Elon Musk claims salvation lies in robots that don’t exist yet. The company’s Q4 2025 earnings revealed a brutal reality: automotive revenues plummeted 11% year-over-year to $69.53 billion, while total vehicle deliveries dropped 8.6% to 1.636 million units. Meanwhile, BYD cruised past Tesla as the world’s top EV maker, selling 2.26 million vehicles compared to Tesla’s shrinking numbers.\n\nThe most telling stat? Europe, where Tesla’s sales cratered 37.2%—the worst performance among all automakers, even as the broader EV market grew. Your Tesla stock might have rebounded 4% post-earnings, but that’s mainly because Musk spent the call talking about anything except cars.\n\nMusk positions Tesla as a “physical AI company” banking on unproven robotics technology.\n\nInstead of addressing why customers increasingly choose cheaper alternatives, Musk doubled down on his AI pivot. Tesla pumped $2 billion into his separate venture xAI, promising mysterious “collaboration frameworks.” The star of this show? Optimus humanoid robots, which Musk claims will enter production before 2026 ends and reach public sales by 2027.\n\nHe’s calling it the “biggest product ever” with poverty-ending potential—basically the tech equivalent of promising world peace through household appliances. The Robotaxi program, once Tesla’s golden ticket to autonomy riches, has quietly stalled. Those “unsupervised” tests that generated headlines? They’ve vanished faster than a TikTok trend.\n\nDeclining sales across all markets expose the risks of chasing sci-fi dreams over current products.\n\nYour Cybertruck enthusiasm apparently wasn’t shared—sales dropped 48% as the angular pickup failed to capture mainstream appeal. “2025 marks the year Tesla lost the BEV crown to BYD… a 620,000-unit gap,” noted Howard Yu from IMD Business School.\n\nThis pivot represents Silicon Valley’s ultimate moonshot mentality: when your core business falters, promise revolutionary technology that’s perpetually “just around the corner.” Tesla’s betting shareholders will stay patient while competitors like BYD offer reliable, affordable EVs today. Whether Musk’s robot army materializes or becomes another Hyperloop-level distraction remains the trillion-dollar question keeping investors awake at night.\n\nFrom the coolest cars to the must-have gadgets, GadgetReview’s daily newsletter keeps you in the know.

    "title": "Ukrainian troops were 'stunned' to learn their British trainers don't use anti-drone nets, UK officer says",
    "description": "Ukrainian soldiers getting combat training from the UK are feeding back key modern warfare lessons that the British Army is adopting.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian soldiers were shocked to learn that anti-drone nets weren't standard for the British Army when they came over for combat training, a UK officer told Business Insider.\n\nLt. Col. Ben Irwin-Clark, the commanding officer of the 1st Battalion of the UK's Irish Guards — an infantry regiment with a long operational history — said he had never seen nets to stop drones used in his 20 years in the army.\n\n\"The Ukrainians were absolutely stunned,\" he said. For the Ukrainians, he shared, the view is \"well, of course you put nets over your positions because that's how you defend yourself.\"\n\nDrones have become ubiquitous in Ukraine and are behind most battlefield strikes, forcing both sides to protect personnel and weaponry from constant airborne threats.\n\nDefenses include low-cost options like nets, which can snag propellers and prevent drones from reaching their targets, be they soldiers or high-value equipment. Soldiers stretch the counter-drone nets over their fortified positions, weapon systems, and armored vehicles. The Ukrainians have also covered key roadways with netting to protect supply routes.\n\nUkrainians have been gathering up netting wherever they can find it to meet demand, even from the fishing villages of partner nations.\n\nThe Ukrainians told their British trainers they needed to get nets, and the UK military reacted fast, Irwin-Clark said.\n\n\"We went 'round every fishing port in the east of England asking for their old fishing nets,\" the officer shared, \"and we've now got hundreds and hundreds of meters of fishing nets, which we drape over positions when we conduct training.\"\n\n\"Are they exactly the right type of drone nets? Dunno,\" he said. \"But in terms of replicating it for training, that's the best we can do. It's entirely free, and it's a lesson we learned entirely from our Ukrainian brothers and sisters.\"\n\nHe said it was \"just one example\" of how Ukrainian front-line experience has shaped British training, with lessons passed on by soldiers arriving directly from combat and rapidly folded into UK doctrine.\n\nThe Irish Guards gained much of that insight during the deployment to Operation Interflex, the UK-led training program that has supported more than 62,000 Ukrainian soldiers, including both new recruits and combat veterans.\n\nSpeaking at a training demo recently attended by Business Insider, Irwin-Clark said that \"it's really inspiring working with the Ukrainians and training Ukrainians, and I think what I hadn't anticipated over a year ago when we started our stint on Interflex is how much we would learn.\"\n\nThe Operation Interflex training is meant to share Western and NATO doctrine with Ukrainian forces to help them fend off Russia's invasion. The exchange, however, has increasingly run both ways, with the UK armed forces modifying aspects of its own training based on Ukrainian input.\n\nUkraine is fighting a large-scale, high-intensity war against a major military power, something the UK and other Western forces have not experienced in decades. As a result, Ukrainian troops often have more recent, firsthand insight into what works, particularly in areas like drone warfare and trench fighting.\n\nBritish trainers say the dynamic works. Col. Boardman, the commanding officer for Operation Interflex, previously told Business Insider that there is a \"really rich mutual understanding going on\" and that the training \"ends up with the sum being much greater than the parts, which is really valuable for us.\" He spoke on the requirement that only his rank and last name be used.\n\nUkrainian soldiers, he said, might explain why a NATO-style tactic is likely to fail under real-world combat conditions and what they do instead. That knowledge is then combined with Western doctrine and used to refine training on both sides. The UK, for instance, adjusted its thinking on how trench battles are fought in response to Ukrainian combat experiences.\n\n\"We are learning an awful lot from our engagement with this war,\" Boardman said.\n\nHe said Ukraine places a lot of value on NATO and Western military doctrine because while \"they may have the current battle experience,\" the Ukrainians \"know that we have some of the history, some of the hard-won experience of this in the past.\"\n\nThe feedback shared during Operation Interflex also prompted the Irish Guards to make other changes, including investing heavily in drone warfare.\n\nIt has since created a new \"drone hub,\" the first of its kind in the British Army, where soldiers can repair drones and develop new ones, and train for drone warfare. It uses tech like 3D printing, a technology adopted on Ukrainian advice.\n\nIrwin-Clark said that out of the 300 people in the battalion, 78 are now pilots or instructors. Speaking at the training demonstration, he described drones as part of \"the future of warfare.\"\n\nOthers within the British Army have acknowledged Ukraine's help in developing the UK's drone warfare capabilities. Boardman, for example, highlighted drones as an area where Ukrainian troops have far more direct experience. \"They are very good at sharing the understanding with us,\" he said.",

    "title": "The Helicopter That Caused the Potomac Air Disaster",
    "description": "Two Army pilots went on an ill-conceived training mission. Within two hours, 67 people were dead.",
    "fullText": "This article was featured in New York’s One Great Story newsletter. \n\nOne year ago, on January 29, 2025, two Army pilots strapped into a Black Hawk helicopter for a training mission out of Fort Belvoir in eastern Virginia and, two hours later, flew it into an airliner that was approaching Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, killing all 67 aboard both aircraft. It was the deadliest air disaster in the United States in a quarter-century. Normally, in the aftermath of an air crash, government investigators take a year or more to issue a final report laying out the reasons the incident occurred. But in this case, the newly seated U.S. president, Donald Trump, held a press conference the next day and blamed the accident on the FAA’s DEI under the Biden and Obama administrations. “They actually came out with a directive, ‘too white,’” he claimed. “And we want the people that are competent.”\n\nIn the months that followed, major media outlets probed several real-world factors that contributed to the tragedy, including staffing shortages at FAA towers, an excess of traffic in the D.C. airspace, and the failure of the Black Hawk to broadcast its location over ADS-B — an automatic reporting system — before the collision. To address this final point, the Senate last month passed the bipartisan ROTOR Act, which would require all aircraft to use ADS-B — “a fitting way to honor the lives of those lost nearly one year ago over the Potomac River,” as bill co-sponsor Ted Cruz put it.\n\nAt a public meeting on Tuesday, the National Transport Safety Board laid out a list of recommended changes in response to the crash, criticizing the FAA for allowing helicopters to operate dangerously close to passenger planes and for allowing professional standards to slip at the control tower.\n\nWhat has gone unexamined in the public discussion of the crash, however, is why these particular pilots were on this mission in the first place, whether they were competent to do what they were trying to do, what adverse conditions they were facing, and who was in charge at the moment of impact. Ultimately, while systemic issues may have created conditions that were ripe for a fatal accident, it was human decision-making in the cockpit that was the immediate cause of this particular crash.\n\nThis account is based on documents from the National Transportation Board (NTSB) accident inquiry and interviews with aviation experts. It shows that, when we focus on the specific details and facts of a case, the cause can seem quite different from what a big-picture overview might indicate. And this, in turn, suggests different logical steps that should be taken to prevent such a tragedy from happening again.\n\nThe whine of the Blackhawk’s engine increased in pitch, and the whump-whump of its four rotor blades grew louder, as the matte-black aircraft lifted into the darkened sky above the single mile-long runway at Davison Army Airfield in Fairfax County, Virginia, about 25 miles southwest of Washington, D.C.\n\nThe UH-60, as it’s formally designated, is an 18,000-pound aircraft that entered service in 1979 as a tactical transport aircraft, used primarily for moving troops and equipment. This one belonged to Company B of the 12th Aviation Battalion, whose primary mission is to transport government VIPs, including Defense Department officials, members of Congress, and visiting dignitaries. Tonight’s flight would operate as PAT 25, for “Priority Air Transit.”\n\nBlack Hawks are typically flown by two pilots. The pilot in command, or PIC, sits in the right-hand seat. Tonight, that role was filled by 39-year-old chief warrant officer Andrew Eaves. Warrant officers rank between enlisted personnel and commissioned officers; it’s the warrant officers who carry out the lion’s share of a unit’s operational flying. When not flying VIPs, Eaves served as a flight instructor and a check pilot, providing periodic evaluation of the skills of other pilots. A native of Mississippi, he had 968 hours of flight experience and was considered a solid pilot by others in the unit.\n\nBefore he took off, Eaves’ commander had discussed the flight with him and admonished him to “not become too fixated on his evaluator role” and to remain “in control of the helicopter,” according to the NTSB investigation.\n\nHis mission was to give a check ride to Captain Rebecca Lobach, the pilot sitting in the left-hand seat. Lobach was a staff officer, meaning that her main role in the battalion was managerial. Nevertheless, she was expected to maintain her pilot qualifications and, to do so, had to undergo a number of annual proficiency checks. Tonight’s three-hour flight was intended to get Lobach her annual sign-off for basic flying skills and for the use of night-vision goggles, or NVGs. To accommodate that, the flight was taking off an hour and 20 minutes after sunset.\n\nBoth pilots wore AN/AVS-6(V)3 Night Vision Goggles, which look like opera glasses and clip onto the front of a pilot’s helmet. They gather ambient light, whether from the moon or stars or from man-made sources; intensify it; and display it through the lens of each element. The eyepiece doesn’t sit directly on the face but about an inch away, so the pilot can look down under it and see the instrument panel.\n\nNight-vision goggles have a narrow field of view, just 40 degrees compared to the 200-degree range of normal vision, which makes it harder for pilots to maintain full situational awareness. They have to pay attention to obstacles and other aircraft outside the window, and they also have to keep track of what the gauges on the panel in front them are saying: how fast they’re going, for instance, and how high. There’s a lot to process, and time is of the essence when you’re zooming along at 120 mph while lower than the tops of nearby buildings. To help with situational awareness, Eaves and Lobach were accompanied by a crew chief, Staff Sergeant Ryan O’Hara, sitting in a seat just behind the cockpit, where he would be able to help keep an eye out for trouble.\n\nThe helicopter turned to the south as it climbed, then flew along the eastern shore of the Potomac until the point where the river makes a big bend to the east. Eaves banked to the right and headed west toward the commuter suburb of Vicksburg, where the lights of house porches and street lamps seemed to twinkle as they fell in and out of the cover of the bare tree branches.\n\nPAT 25 followed the serpentine course of the Rapidan River through the hills and farm fields of the Piedmont. At this point, Eaves was not only the pilot in command, but also the pilot flying, meaning that he had his hands on the controls that guide the aircraft’s speed and direction and his feet on the rudder pedals that keep the helicopter “in trim” — that is, lined up with its direction of flight. Lobach played a supporting role, working the radio, keeping an eye out for obstacles and other traffic, and figuring out their location by referencing visible landmarks.\n\nLobach, 28, had been a pilot for four years. She’d been an ROTC cadet at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which she graduated from in 2019. Both her parents were doctors; she’d dreamed of a medical career but eventually realized that she couldn’t pursue one in the Army. According to her roommate, “She did not have a huge, massive passion” for aviation but chose it because it was the closest she could get to practicing medicine, under the circumstances. “She badly wanted to be a Black Hawk pilot because she wanted to be a medevac unit,” he told NTSB investigators. After she completed flight training at Fort Rucker, she was stationed at Fort Belvoir, where she joined the 12th Aviation Battalion and was put in charge of the oil-and-lubricants unit. One fellow pilot in the unit described her to the NTSB as “incredibly professional, very diligent and very thorough.”\n\nIn addition to her official duties, Lobach served as a volunteer social liaison at the White House, where she regularly represented the Army at Medal of Honor ceremonies and state dinners. She was both a fitness fanatic and a baker, known for providing fresh sourdough bread to her unit. She had started dabbling in real-estate investments and looked forward to moving in with her boyfriend of one year, another Army pilot with whom she talked about having “lots and lots of babies.” She was planning to leave the service in 2027 and had already applied for medical school at Mount Sinai. Helicopter flying was not something she intended to pursue.\n\nThough talented as a manager, she wasn’t much of a pilot. Helicopter flying is an extremely demanding feat of coordination and balance, akin to juggling and riding a unicycle at the same time. For Lobach, the difficulty was compounded by the fact that she had trained on highly automated, relatively easy-to-fly helicopters at Fort Rucker and then been assigned to an older aircraft, the Black Hawk L or “Lima” model, at Fort Belvoir. Unlike newer models, which can maintain their altitude on autopilot, the Lima requires constant care and attention, and Lobach struggled to master it. One instructor described her skills as “well below average,” noting that she had “lots of difficulties in the aircraft.” Three years before, she’d failed the night-vision evaluation she was taking tonight.\n\nBefore the flight, Eaves had told his girlfriend that he was concerned about Lobach’s capability as a pilot and that, skill-wise, she was “not where she should be.”\n\nIt’s not uncommon for pilots to struggle during the early phase of their career. But Lobach’s development had been particularly slow. In her five years in the service, she had accumulated just 454 hours of flight time, and she wasn’t clocking more very quickly. The Army requires officers in her role to fly at least 60 hours a year, but in the past 12 months, she’d flown only 56.7. Her superiors had made an exception for her because in March she’d had knee surgery for a sports injury, preventing her from flying for three months. The waiver made her technically qualified to fly, but it didn’t change the fact that she was rustier than pilots were normally allowed to become.\n\nIf she’d been keen on flying, she could have used every moment of this flight to hone her skills by taking the controls herself. But she was content to let Eaves do the flying during the first part of the trip.\n\nDrawing near to Greenhouse Airport, a small, private grass runway near a plant nursery, they navigated via an old-fashioned technique called pilotage, using landmarks and dead reckoning to find their way from point to point. Coming in for their first landing of the night, they were looking for the airstrip’s signature greenhouse complex.\n\nLobach: That large lit building may be part of it.\n\nEaves: It does look like a greenhouse, doesn’t it?\n\nLobach: Yeah, it does, doesn’t it? We can start slowing back.\n\nEaves: All right, slowing back.\n\nAs they circled around the runway, Eaves commented that the lighting of the greenhouse building was so intense that it was blinding in the NVGs, and Lobach agreed. Eaves positioned the helicopter a few hundred feet above the landing zone and asked Lobach to show him where it was. After she did so correctly, he told her to take the controls. This process followed a formalized set of acknowledgements to make sure that both parties understood who was in control of the aircraft.\n\nEaves: You’ve got the flight controls.\n\nAs Lobach eased the helicopter toward the ground, Eaves and Crew Chief O’Hara called out times from the landing checklist.\n\nO’Hara: Clear of obstacles on the left.\n\nLobach: Thank you. Coming forward.\n\nThey touched down. One minute and 42 seconds after passing control to Lobach, Eaves took it back again. As they sat on the ground with their rotor whirring, they discussed the fuel remaining aboard the aircraft and the direction they would travel in during the next segment of their flight. Finally, after six minutes, Eaves signaled that they were ready to take off again.\n\nEaves: Whenever you’re ready, ma’am.\n\nEaves’s deference to Lobach was symptomatic of what is known among psychologists as an “inverted authority gradient.” Although he was the pilot in command, both responsible for the flight and in a position of authority over others on it, Eaves held a lesser rank than Lobach and so in a broader context was her subordinate. In moments of high stress, this ambiguity can muddy the waters as to who is supposed to be making crucial decisions.\n\nEaves, Lobach, and O’Hara ran through their checklists, and Eaves eased the Black Hawk up into the night sky.\n\nThey headed north, bending to the east to avoid Culpeper Airport to their left. The scattering of lights beneath them was sparse as they passed over the rural foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Cruising at an altitude of 2,000 feet, the aircraft hit rough air.\n\nIt was a complaint Lobach continued to make throughout the night. A cold front was moving through the area, bringing winds that gusted up to 45 mph. The wind wasn’t dangerous, but it kept pushing the aircraft off its flight path and caused constant unexpected jerks. It was another stress factor in a night that already had plenty.\n\nTwo minutes later, Lobach declared that she was taking control of the aircraft. Eaves sounded surprised.\n\nLobach: I got the flight controls.\n\nEaves: Yup, you got flight controls.\n\nEaves: You do have flight controls. Sorry about that.\n\nLobach pointed out that they had descended below their intended altitude of 2,000 feet and were now at 1,600 feet. Eaves was confused, then realized that he had misread the altimeter display.\n\nThe fact that Eaves would make such a mistake is a reminder that, while he was a much more experienced and proficient pilot than Lobach, he, too, was a pilot with less than a thousand hours of flight time. In order to even start a career as an airline pilot in the U.S., you need a minimum of 1,500 hours.\n\nThe 12th Aviation Battalion is an elite unit with a glamorous and high-stakes mission: flying government officials and VIPs around in the nation’s capital. A decade ago, it was staffed by experienced aviators who would build flight time elsewhere before being transferred to the unit. But in recent years, it had begun accepting pilots straight out of flight school. “The unit is strapped for resources,” Lobach’s roommate told the NTSB. “They have struggled with staffing issues in general.”\n\nSimilar problems exist throughout Army aviation; the service has been having a hard time retaining its most experienced pilots and providing adequate flight time for those currently coming up through the ranks. Since 2011, the average number of hours flown per year by crewed Army aircraft has fallen from 302 to 198.\n\nLobach continued to fret about the wind, while Eaves seemed unfazed.\n\nLobach: Strong headwind right now.\n\nLobach: Uh, pretty strong headwind.\n\nShe pointed out that even though the airspeed indicator had the helicopter moving at 110 knots, the GPS was showing their groundspeed as 93 knots, implying a headwind of 17 knots or 20 mph.\n\nAfter Lobach again commented on how choppy the conditions were, Eaves took control back, just a minute and 48 seconds after he had relinquished it. In the first hour of flying time, Lobach had been operating the controls for a total of three and a half minutes.\n\nPAT 25 was skirting the edge of the busy restricted airspace around Dulles and Reagan, a three-dimensional imaginary blob 90 miles across with corridors cut through at low altitudes for helicopter traffic. It’s a complicated and busy environment that encompasses three major airports and three military airbases and is patrolled by military helicopters from three different branches of the military. Some transport VIPs, others hunt and intercept drones and aircraft that shouldn’t be in this highly sensitive space.\n\nTo be clear, there was no need for PAT 25 to be messing around in this airspace. All Lobach needed to do on this flight was demonstrate her proficiency with night-vision goggles and her skill at operating the aircraft. They could have done everything in the much quieter region around Greenhouse Airport, and other flight instructors routinely did. “I would go kind of west and south, for the most part,” says Austin Roth, a former instructor pilot in the 12th Aviation Battalion who flew with Eaves and even once gave him a check ride. “That was my preference.”\n\nAs they passed over the Civil War battlefield of Thoroughfare Gap, an alarm called a master caution went off, indicating that a control system for a tail fin was malfunctioning. If the situation worsened and the surface became stuck, the helicopter could crash. Lobach immediately started to run an emergency checklist. To their relief, they were able to reset the system without difficulty.\n\nOnce everything was sorted out, Eaves took a moment to critique her performance.\n\nEaves: “So how’s that supposed to look, ma’am?”\n\nLobach: “That EP [emergency checklist]?\n\nLobach realized that in her haste to resolve the issue, she’d skipped a preliminary step: pulling out a document called the flight reference card (FRC) and reading the action steps from it directly, rather than relying on memory.\n\nEaves: Yup. So, I mean, that’s the whole point of the FRC cards, right, is to get us away from doing those things automatically … ’cause we end up killing ourselves because we do something without confirming and verifying …\n\nLobach: Okay, thank you, yeah, you’re absolutely right. I sometimes forget that.\n\nSoon after, Lobach complained of lightheadedness.\n\nLobach: I don’t know about you, but I’m feeling a little dizzy, like, looking down and around with the winds or whatever it is, but not too bad.\n\nEaves: Roger. It is definitely windy. But a beautiful night other than that.\n\nThey were now at their maximum distance to the north from their home airfield at Fort Davison. To get back, they could either return the way they came, flying south and then east, or go the other way around Dulles and Reagan by flying east and then south. Doing the latter would necessitate cutting through the busiest part of the whole Washington airspace, using the river routes that thread between Reagan National Airport and the National Mall.\n\nThat’s what Eaves chose to do. As they were turning east, Lobach decided that she was ready to fly the helicopter.\n\nLobach: Would you be up for me flying for a little while?\n\nEaves: Yup, by all means, ma’am.\n\nTheir next landing spot was a helipad located at the Federal Support Center, an underground facility located at a former Nike missile-launch site in Olney, Maryland. As they drew near, Eaves prepped Lobach for their arrival. As usual, they would fly to a pre-chosen waypoint, known as a release point (RP), then decelerate and descend to a touchdown in the landing zone. Now that the wind was at their back, it was pushing them to a higher groundspeed than their airspeed, meaning that they had less time to plan and react as they maneuvered for landing.\n\nEaves: All right, you’re 1.4 [kilometers] to your RP.\n\nLobach: Okay. Slow down, come down a bit. Wow, that’s wild! I’m slowing down and still at a hundred knots ground.\n\nEaves: 0.7 [kilometers]. What’s your RP?\n\nLobach: Um, I’m sorry — what do you mean, “What was it?”\n\nEaves: All right, what am I looking for on the ground?\n\nLobach: Um, I can’t remember, I have to look at my notes.\n\nEaves told her not to worry about her notes, which told her how to visually identify their landing spot, and instead to simply follow her navigational instruments, which had been programmed with the waypoint’s coordinates.\n\nAs they descended, Eaves and O’Hara called out items on the pre-landing checklist. Lobach commented that she could feel the strong, gusty wind pushing on the left side of the aircraft. Both she and Eaves were scanning ahead, looking for the helipad amid the trees and buildings below them. Eaves spotted it first, then Lobach. But as she maneuvered to come in for a landing to the north, she lost track of it.\n\nEaves: Remember, there is a fence on the north side of this pad.\n\nLobach: Yeah. Thank you … probably still coming in a little too fast. Not so bad. See that big tree on the right? Am I clear of that?\n\nSuddenly, the landing was not looking so good, and Eaves told her to abort.\n\nEaves: Go around! Go around! Go around!\n\nLobach added power and climbed away from the terrain. As she did, building airspeed, she put the helicopter into a banked turn.\n\nEaves: Are you going — which way are you going, ma’am?\n\nLobach: I was going to go right, sorry, do you want me to go left?\n\nEaves: I think it would probably be better, because you’re turning into the wind, right?\n\nThe idea of a go-around is to climb in order to come around and try landing again, but Lobach was starting to feel sketched out.\n\nLobach: I’m not sure I’m, I’m —\n\nLobach: This doesn’t feel right.\n\nEaves: Yup. You’re good. Feels like you’re getting your ass kicked with some wind to the left, right?\n\nEaves: So go ahead and start your approach.\n\nEaves coached her to add power and get the aircraft back in position to try landing again.\n\nLobach: Yeah, I — I’m not comfortable landing there.\n\nLobach: I’m clearing out. I probably could, but — it’s handling funny.\n\nEaves: All right. Mind if I give it a shot?\n\nEaves took the controls and landed the helicopter. On the ground, he talked her through how to handle the tricky winds and offered her a chance to try again.\n\nLobach: Yeah, honestly — I, uh, when we got to the … at that point, that’s probably, like, where I was like, Yeah, I don’t want to do this, ’cause I can’t really see it, like maybe I need to be higher in my chair or something, but I kind of lost any … Yeah, I’m good with the demonstration.\n\nEaves had no objections, and they decided to head back to base. By failing to complete the maneuver as requested, Lobach had effectively failed the check ride. Once back at their home base, Eaves would have to give her a rating of “unsatisfactory,” and Lobach would be put on training status until she was able to demonstrate the necessary proficiency.\n\nBut as they continued their mission, neither mentioned that fact.\n\nTheir course south took them across the wealthy Maryland suburbs of Bethesda and Cabin John, passing over golf courses, nature preserves, and tracts of expensive homes as they headed for the Potomac.\n\nFour minutes after takeoff, perhaps to show that she was not intimidated by the aircraft, Lobach again asked to take the controls. She would have them for the rest of the flight.\n\nPilots who are rusty or lack experience do not have the muscle memory that more skilled pilots possess. When too much information is flooding in at once, they are unable to process it all and become what psychologists call “task saturated.” Among aviators, the condition is known as being “behind the plane.” In this state pilots, are unable to plan ahead to anticipate problems. They respond reactively or simply miss cues altogether. They are not, in other words, fully in control of the aircraft.\n\nReaching the Potomac again at Cabin John, she was too high — 1,400 feet instead of the max altitude of 1,300 — and turned right instead of left, nearly putting the helicopter into forbidden airspace. Rather than taking control of the aircraft back from her, Eaves gently teased her. She pulled a 180, descending as she entered Route 1, a flight corridor along the Potomac’s northern shore.\n\nYou could think of these D.C. helicopter routes as tunnels through the otherwise forbidden airspace. They have a defined ceiling that gets lower and lower as you get closer to the center of the city but no defined lateral boundaries; instead, pilots are instructed to follow the bank of the river. That may seem a little vague, but pilots understand how to do it.\n\n“When I flew those routes, especially at night, I always flew them right on the bank,” says Tim Lilley, a former Army pilot who operated Black Hawks in the D.C. metro area. “One of the reasons is it’s very much easier to tell if you’re gaining or losing altitude, looking at trees and rocks and whatever is on the bank, as opposed to looking at water. If you’re looking at water, there’s no contrast, so you don’t know if you’re climbing or descending unless you look at your instruments. It’s a very bad idea to fly just flat over water at 200 feet, because you’re going to have to spend a lot of time looking inside to make sure you’re at the right altitude. You could very quickly lose 200 feet and end up in the drink.”\n\nAs she flew down the river, Lobach was clearly struggling to stay in control of the aircraft. Eaves nudged her to keep the helicopter in trim and to find the correct altitude.\n\nAt 8:43, as they passed one of the most sensitive and restricted airspaces in the world — the vice-president’s residence at the Naval Observatory — Lobach again complained about the turbulence.\n\nLobach: Getting choppy close to the ground.\n\nEaves: Oh yeah, down low it’s definitely gonna get choppy.\n\nLobach: Yeah. We’re at 300 [feet altitude].\n\nThat was not correct, as Eaves indirectly reminded her.\n\nLobach descended, but the ceiling of the corridor was decreasing as well, so she needed to come down further still.\n\nEaves: All right, there’s 300 for 200.\n\nBut she was not at 200 feet. As she passed the Lincoln Memorial, she was above 300 feet and, in fact, had begun climbing. She had also let the aircraft get out of trim, so that the helicopter was flying somewhat sideways to the wind. Novice pilots who are fixated on one of the numerous aspects of their flight — altitude, location, speed, communication with air-traffic control — can easily lose track of the trim. But it’s an important part of good airmanship, especially during turns.\n\nSouth of the Lincoln Memorial, the helicopter route bends east to cross the Tidal Basin and follows a side branch, the Washington Channel, which is occupied by a small marina. Staying on track required a sharp turn to the left.\n\nEaves: Lots of right pedal, ma’am.\n\nEaves: There we go, now we can make the turn.\n\nHe noticed that, in the process of getting the helicopter to fly straight, she had lost track of her altitude and gotten too high again.\n\nEaves: You’re at 300 feet. Come down for me.\n\nLobach stopped climbing and brought the helicopter into a sharp, short descent, but still remained above the route ceiling.\n\nAs PAT 25 was working its way southeast along Route 1, a regional jet inbound from Wichita was coming up the river from the south, heading for runway 33 at Reagan. Operated by a subsidiary of American Airlines, PSA Airlines flight 5342 was a Bombardier CRJ700 with four crewmembers and 60 passengers, including a group of teenage figure skaters, coaches, and parents returning from the national figure-skating championships.\n\nPAT 25’s path along the east bank of the Potomac would take it right under the designated flight path for jets landing on runway 33. Technically, if neither the helicopter nor the plane deviated from its assigned route, they would pass each other safely, but the margin was so small — just 75 feet at the point of closest approach — that the air-traffic controller at Reagan’s tower called PAT 25 to alert it.\n\nReagan Tower: PAT 25, traffic just south of Wilson Bridge is a CRJ at 1,200 feet for runway 33.\n\nThe primary job of an air-traffic controller is to keep aircraft from colliding. Given that two aircraft on the controller’s screen were now on a converging course, it was crucial to ensure that their paths did not intersect. A commonly used option was to hold southbound helicopter traffic at Hains Point, where the Washington Channel rejoins the main channel of the Potomac, until the landing plane had passed. Instead, Eaves assured the tower that he could see the incoming flight and asked for permission to stay clear of it under his own cognizance.\n\nEaves: PAT 25 has the traffic in sight. Request visual separation.\n\nReagan Tower: Separation approved.\n\nEaves did not have PSA 5342 in sight. As he looked to the south, the airliner would have appeared as one of a string of bright-white dots strung above the horizon. Some commentators have speculated that Eaves had another aircraft in sight, which he mistakenly believed to be PSA 5342. But it may have been that he didn’t have any aircraft in sight at all. During an interview with NTSB investigators, Army Chief Warrant Officer David Van Vechten testified that it was common practice for pilots in the 12th Aviation Battalion to say that they had the traffic in sight even when they didn’t, so that the tower would give them the visual separation clearance. “I’ve done that,” Van Vechten said. “I know if I don’t say it, I may have to hold.”\n\nAs they approached Hains Point, Eaves noted that the wind was pushing them, from behind and from the side, toward the eastern bank. To stay on course, Lobach would have to counteract that push by angling the helicopter to the right.\n\nLobach: Crabbing … better not to fight the wind. Right pedal.\n\nFifty seconds later, PAT 25 rejoined the main channel of the Potomac at Hains Point. The lights of Reagan Airport lay a half mile to the right. The PSA flight was a mile and a half away, dead ahead, on a converging course, and closing at a speed of more than 200 mph.\n\nIn the aftermath of the crash, investigators focused on the staffing level at the Reagan tower, concerned that an overburdened controller had mistakenly allowed the aircraft to converge, but the transcript shows that the close approach of the jet and the helicopter was front-of-mind for him. As the distance between the aircraft closed, he checked in with the Black Hawk.\n\nReagan Tower: PAT 25, you have the CRJ in sight? PAT 25 pass behind the CRJ.\n\nEaves: PAT 25 has aircraft in sight. Request visual separation.\n\nReagan Tower: Visual separation.\n\nFlying south from Hains Point, Lobach should have eased to the left to join the bank of the Potomac. Instead, she headed straight down the center of the river. Out here over the water, the river was just a black void. The only way to gauge how high she was was to look at the altimeter inside the cockpit. But that meant not looking outside at what was in front of her.\n\nLikely, she was still task saturated: trying to keep the helicopter at the right altitude, and along the right path, while wrestling with turbulence and a gusty wind that was pushing her toward the river bank on her left, all while wearing night-vision goggles that blocked her peripheral vision and overwhelmed her eyes with too much light. In this environment, with all the lights of the city around her, it would actually have been much easier to see with the goggles off, but that would have defeated the purpose of the mission.\n\nIn a word, Lobach was flailing. Eaves was as well, too distracted by his runaway student pilot to pay attention to what was happening outside the cockpit.\n\nEaves: All right, kinda come left for me, ma’am. I think that’s why he’s asking.\n\nLobach did not turn toward the eastern bank.\n\nAt 8:47:57.7, the helicopter’s black box recorded Lobach making a “sound similar to mumbling.”\n\nThe Blackhawk helicopter was flying at an altitude of 278 feet and a speed of 120 mph. It was both too far out from the riverbank and too high, which put it squarely in the path of the CRJ descending at 128 mph.\n\nOne second before impact, the CRJ’s flight crew tried to pull the airplane up. The helicopter’s main rotor hit the nose and engines of the airliner, triggering a fireball, and the commingled wreckage fell vertically into the Potomac River. The impact would have been unsurvivable for anyone onboard.\n\nWhat Lobach faced on the final night of her life was a mission that was far beyond her skill level. She was a low-proficiency pilot with a low aptitude for flying, one who didn’t fly regularly in an operational role and had no intention of flying after leaving the service. She was operating a helicopter that was older, less automated, and more challenging than what she’d trained on. Her instructor pilot had been warned to keep a tight rein on her during the flight but had failed to do so.\n\nAs the pilot in command, Eaves bears personal responsibility for what happened. But responsibility was not his alone. The crash was also a product of a dysfunctional system. For years, the Army air-accident rate has been climbing, as aviators complain that they are not being given enough flight time to maintain adequate levels of skill.\n\n“Across a lot of Army aviation units … what we’re seeing is that composite cockpit time is steadily going down and down and down,” said NTSB Chairman Jennifer Homendy during a hearing into the accident. “Five years ago, we would have thousands of hours cockpit. Now, we have hundreds and hundreds of hours cockpit … Experience across aviation formations is steadily decreasing.”\n\nIt’s striking that this decrease is even being felt at the 12th Aviation Battalion, whose mission is to transport the legislators who make Defense spending decisions and the Pentagon brass who implement those decisions. You’d think that they’d want their lives entrusted to only the most skilled pilots. The fate of PAT 25 shows that the unit can’t even be trusted to transport itself. “At her flight time of 460-something hours, if you’re not flying once a week, you are not proficient,” says Tim Lilley, the former Army Black Hawk pilot. “Certainly not proficient enough to fly high-ranking officials.” Yet the Army considered Lobach qualified to do just that.\n\nAfter Lilley retired from the military, he became an airline pilot, and eventually his son Samuel became an airline pilot, too. Samuel Lilley was serving as the first officer of PSA 5342 on the night of January 29, 2025. In the year since his death Tim has been on a mission to change the Army’s approach so that tragedies like this don’t happen again.\n\n“It was an embarrassment to Army aviation,” he says. “And you know, I still proudly wear my Army wings. But there’s a lot of things that have to be addressed.”\n\nOne thing he’d like to see happen is for the Army to establish a rigorous safety-reporting system of the kind that’s standard in commercial aviation. Another is to make sure that pilots get enough flying time to be proficient, even if that means taking staff officers off the roster entirely. “They have 14,000 active pilots. And I said to the Army Chief of Staff, ‘Wouldn’t you rather have 11,000 proficient pilots, rather than 14,000 pilots that are barely getting minimums?’”\n\nHe knows that it will be a hard journey to get there. Cultures don’t change easily. But a son’s death is a powerful motivator. As for Eaves and Lobach, he doesn’t blame them for his son’s death. He thinks that Lobach could have become a good pilot if they gave her another thousand hours of flying time. Instead, the Army withheld from her the training and flight time that she needed to fly safely and then required her to go fly anyway on a mission that was as ill-conceived as it was poorly executed.\n\n“There was no reason for them to be there,” he says. “This was a bad idea. A bad plan from the get-go.”",

    "fullText": "Syrian government forces have entered the vast al-Hol camp, which houses thousands of people linked to ISIL (ISIS), after the withdrawal of Kurdish forces who had been controlling the facility for years.\n\nArmoured vehicles carrying troops moved into the camp, located in the desert region of Hasakeh province, on Wednesday – a day after the Syrian government announced a four-day ceasefire with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).\n\nThe transfer of control of the camp, which houses some 24,000 people – mostly women and children linked to ISIL – came after two weeks of fighting between the army and the SDF that was brought to a halt by Tuesday’s truce.\n\nThe fighting has seen the SDF, which played a major role in defeating ISIL in alliance with a United States-led international coalition, lose swathes of north and east Syria.\n\nThe Kurdish forces had controlled the territories during the chaos of Syria’s civil war, which ended in December 2024 with the fall of former President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\n\nThe government of President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Damascus has been pushing for Kurdish fighters to integrate into Syrian state institutions, as outlined under a March 2025 deal signed with SDF.\n\nTom Barrack, the US envoy to Syria, said in a statement on Tuesday that the SDF’s role as the primary anti-ISIL force had “largely expired” and that the government in Damascus is “both willing and positioned to take over security responsibilities”.\n\nYet despite this week’s truce, Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi reported from Aleppo province that renewed clashes on the outskirts of Kobani were reported on Wednesday.\n\n“We heard gunfire, we heard anti-aircraft fire from the Syrian military side, most likely trying to target drones. The situation is very, very tense,” Basravi said.\n\nSyria’s Defence Ministry said on Wednesday that seven soldiers were killed in a drone attack that it blamed on the SDF in the Hasakeh countryside, the country’s state-run SANA news agency reported.\n\nSANA said the attack targeted the Syrian army as its forces attempted to clear a facility previously used to manufacture explosives and drone munitions in northeastern Hasakeh, near the border with Iraq. It said seven soldiers were killed and 20 others wounded.\n\nEarlier this week, President al-Sharaa and SDF chief Mazloum Abdi had agreed that the Syrian state would take over responsibility for ISIL prisoners.\n\nAbdi on Tuesday urged the US-led coalition to “bear its responsibilities in protecting facilities” holding ISIL members.\n\nAl-Hol is the largest camp for people with links to ISIL, which was defeated in Syria in 2019.\n\nThe camp was established by Kurdish forces after they took control of swathes of Syria, with coalition backing.\n\nThose held at al-Hol include about 14,500 Syrians and nearly 3,000 Iraqis.\n\nSome 6,500 others, many of them loyal ISIL supporters who came from around the world to join the armed group, are separately held in a high-security section of the camp.\n\nThe SDF remains in control of the vast majority of more than a dozen prisons where some 9,000 members of ISIL have been held for years, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe largest facility, holding about 4,500 ISIL-linked detainees, is the Gweiran Prison, located in the city of Hasakeh, which is still under full control of the SDF.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Syrian Interior Ministry said 120 ISIL members escaped from the Shaddadi prison in Hasakeh province.\n\nThe army accused the SDF of releasing ISIL detainees from the facility, while the Kurds said they lost control of the facility after an attack by Damascus.\n\nSince then, many of the detainees who fled were captured by government troops who took control of the jail, state media reported.",

    "fullText": "Norway has issued thousands of letters to citizens warning that the army may have to seize their homes and vehicles if war breaks out with Russia.\n\nNorwegian military officials said the letters were an advance warning to those with assets that may need to be requisitioned.\n\nThe requisition policy covers vehicles, boats, machinery and property, and around 13,500 “preparatory requisitions” were issued on Monday, valid for one year.\n\n“The requisitions are intended to ensure that, in a wartime situation, the armed forces have access to the resources necessary for the defence of the country,” the Norwegian military said.\n\nThe letters will not have come as a shock to most recipients, as two thirds of them were simply renewing requisition notices from previous years.\n\nAnders Jernberg, the head of the military’s logistics organisation, said: “The importance of being prepared for crisis and war has increased dramatically in recent years.”\n\n“Norway is in the most serious security policy situation since the Second World War. Our society must be prepared for security policy crises and, in the worst case, war... we are undertaking a major build-up of military and civil preparedness,” he added.\n\nNorway plays a key role in Nato surveillance of the Arctic region, where the melting of the ice caps has created a scramble to secure new shipping routes and lucrative raw materials.\n\nThe Scandinavian country shares a maritime border – as well as a 123 mile-long land border – with Russia in the far northern Arctic region.\n\nRussia and China are seeking to expand their presence in the Arctic region, with the former building up old Soviet bases in the region and expanding its nuclear weapons stockpile on the Kola peninsula.\n\nThe requisition notices were issued amid an ongoing diplomatic crisis between the United States and Europe over president Donald Trump’s plans to annex Greenland, the minerals-rich Arctic island.\n\nMr Trump has cited Arctic security concerns as his main argument for annexing Greenland, an autonomous Danish overseas territory that is part of the Nato alliance.\n\nHe has threatened military action to take over the island, a step that would probably destroy the Western alliance even as it faces the growing risk of war with Russia.\n\nOn Monday, it emerged that Mr Trump also wants to take over Greenland because he is upset with Norway for refusing to give him a Nobel peace prize last year.\n\nDenmark and Greenland say the island is not for sale. They have the full support of Britain and the European Union.\n\nBut Sir Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister, said on Monday that he does not believe the United States is planning a military takeover of the island.\n\n“I don’t, actually. I think that this can be resolved and should be resolved through calm discussion, but with the application of the principles and values that I’ve set out in terms of who decides the future of Greenland, and making clear that the use of tariffs in this way is completely wrong,” he said.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Telegraph, Norway’s defence minister warned that Russia had recently launched a major expansion of its military bases in the Arctic region.\n\n“Russia is building up on the Kola peninsula ... where one of the largest arsenals of nuclear warheads in the world is located. They [the nuclear weapons] are not only pointed towards Norway, but towards the UK and over the pole towards Canada and the US,” Tore O. Sandvik told the Telegraph.\n\nMoscow is also trying to gain full control over the Arctic region in order to block Nato access to key shipping routes, he said.\n\n“We are the eyes and ears of Nato in this area, and we see that they’re testing new weapons, for example, hypersonic missiles, and they are testing nuclear-driven torpedoes and nuclear warheads,” he said.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "EL PASO, Texas (AP) — An immigrant from Nicaragua was found dead at a Texas immigration detention facility last week, federal officials said.\n\nVictor Manuel Diaz appears to have killed himself Wednesday at the sprawling tent complex at the U.S. Army's Fort Bill base in El Paso, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement. The federal investigation into his death continues.\n\nIt's the same facility where ICE said another detainee died earlier this month as staff members tried to keep him from killing himself. But a fellow detainee said at least five officers were restraining the handcuffed inmate and at least one had an arm around his neck.\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE — This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988.\n\nDiaz was swept up on Jan. 6 in the federal crackdown on immigration in Minnesota and sent to Texas, ICE said.\n\nDiaz entered the United States in March 2024 and Border Patrol officers took him into custody, He was released on parole pending a court date and a judge ordered him to leave the U.S. in an August hearing that Diaz did not attend, ICE said.\n\nDiaz was given a final order for removal on Jan. 12, two days before he was found unconscious in his room, authorities said.\n\nICE did not release any other details on Diaz's death. The agency notifies Congress and releases a statement on its website of all in-custody deaths.\n\nDiaz, 36, was being held at Camp Montana East where ICE said another detainee, Geraldo Lunas Campos, died as staff members tried to prevent him from killing himself.\n\nBut a preliminary investigation by the El Paso County Medical Examiner’s Office found Lunas Campos, 55, died from asphyxia from chest and neck compression and said the death would likely be classified a homicide.\n\nA fellow detainee told the AP that Lunas Campos was handcuffed and refused to go back into his cell when at least five guards pinned him to the floor. The detainee said at least one of the guards squeezed an arm around Lunas Campos' neck.\n\nICE said it is still investigating that death.",

    "description": "U.S. Army Reserve Black Hawk pilot Chris Busby, 28, and Stephanie Kenny-Velasquez, 25, went to an Austin courthouse to get their marriage certificate on Dec. 3.",
    "fullText": "U.S. Army Reserve Black Hawk pilot Chris Busby, 28, and Stephanie Kenny-Velasquez, 25, went to an Austin courthouse to get their marriage certificate on Dec. 3.\n\nRoughly 48 hours later, Velasquez entered a Houston Immigration and Customs Enforcement office for a routine check-in and never emerged, Busby said. The uncertainty has left the newlywed questioning whether his time serving the country was worth it, he said.\n\n“Stephanie is beautiful, she is smart, she’s amazing,” he said. “If it means sacrificing myself or my career to free her, I will do it.”\n\nBusby, who enlisted in the Army Reserve in 2015, has spent the last six weeks looking for ways to free his wife from detention. Despite his years of service and their recent nuptials, Velasquez was denied bond on Jan. 9, according to her lawyer.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment. The Department of Justice declined to comment on Velasquez’s case.\n\nVelasquez came to the United States in 2021 hoping to start a new life far from the violence and political instability of her native Venezuela. She does not have a criminal record and presented herself to immigration officials in Miami when she arrived in the country.\n\nIn the meantime, Velasquez, 25, settled into life in Austin. She picked up a job at a local car wash and took classes to get her real estate license.\n\nThe couple met in March and Busby, 28, immediately knew she was the one.\n\n“I’ve never met anyone like her,” he said. “She came here and just wanted to be the best.”\n\nTheir families had no idea that the couple planned to marry, and that’s how Busby said he wanted it. Busby said he was saving up money from his glass installation business to pay for a big wedding down the line.\n\nVelasquez had an asylum case pending at the time of her detention.\n\nHer brother, Oscar, described his younger sister as ambitious and driven. She hoped to start her own company one day and diligently saved money from working at the car wash and helping Busby with his window tinting business. She was studying for her real estate exam on the car ride to her immigration check-in, her husband said, adding that the test was scheduled for the following week.\n\n“She worked so hard for everything she had,” her brother said. “She was so happy.”\n\nBut on the day his sister was scheduled to check in with immigration officials, the family remained worried that Velasquez could be swept up in President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown despite her recent marriage and pending asylum case, he said.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have fled political repression and economic crisis in recent years, arriving in the United States seeking asylum or other legal protections like temporary protected status, or TPS.\n\nTrump moved to revoke TPS for many Venezuelans, which has been in place since 2023, and from other countries as part of his agenda to restrict immigration. That has been allowed to move forward while legal challenges to the action make their way through the courts.\n\n“We left to have a better future, more opportunities. Now if we go outside, we could be stopped by ICE,” Oscar said.\n\nLike other Venezuelans who have emigrated, Oscar said returning to Venezuela right now is unthinkable following the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. The country is far too dangerous and unstable for them to return, he said.\n\nVelasquez was transferred to the Montgomery Processing Center in Conroe, nearly three hours away from Austin. Since she entered detention her hair has thinned, Busby said. She sleeps fitfully in a bunk bed surrounded by 80 women, who share seven tablets to contact loved ones and lawyers, Busby said. They are allowed one visit per week and given food that is barely edible, he added.\n\nThe stress has taken a toll on Velasquez, according to her husband.\n\n“The girl is 25 years old. She should not be looking like she’s pushing 40,” Busby said.\n\nThe couple is now hoping for a Hail Mary in the form of the military’s Parole in Place program, which is intended to provide legal protections for spouses who lack U.S citizenship.\n\nBut the administration has slowly chipped away at the program, and a 2024 court ruling ended a Biden-era expansion called Keeping Families Together, which added stepchildren to the list of eligible relatives.\n\nA message on the initiative’s website said the Department of Homeland Security would no longer accept applications or adjudicate ones that were pending. The agency did not immediately respond to a request clarifying whether the Parole in Place program still applies to spouses.\n\n“I’m trying my hardest but there is so little I can do,” Busby said. “I just want her out of there.”\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "fullText": "BAGHDAD (AP) — U.S. forces have fully withdrawn from an air base in western Iraq in implementation of an agreement with the Iraqi government, Iraqi officials said Saturday.\n\nWashington and Baghdad agreed in 2024 to wind down a U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group in Iraq by September 2025, with U.S. forces departing bases where they had been stationed.\n\nHowever, a small unit of U.S. military advisers and support personnel remained. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani in October told journalists that the agreement originally stipulated a full pullout of U.S. forces from the Ain al-Asad air base in western Iraq by September. But “developments in Syria” since then required maintaining a “small unit” of between 250 and 350 advisers and security personnel at the base.\n\nNow all U.S. personnel have departed.\n\nIraqi Army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Abdul Amir Rashid Yarallah oversaw the assignment of tasks and duties to various military units at the base on Saturday following the withdrawal of U.S. forces and the Iraqi Army’s full assumption of control over the base, the military said in a statement.\n\nThe statement added that Yarallah “instructed relevant authorities to intensify efforts, enhance joint work, and coordinate between all units stationed at the base, while making full use of its capabilities and strategic location.”\n\nA Ministry of Defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly confirmed that all U.S. forces had departed the base and had also removed all American equipment from it.\n\nThere was no statement from the U.S. military on the withdrawal.\n\nU.S. forces have retained a presence in the semi-autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq and in neighboring Syria.\n\nThe departure of U.S. forces may strengthen the hand of the government in discussions around disarmament of non-state armed groups in the country, some of which have used the presence of U.S. troops as justification for keeping their own weapons.\n\nAl-Sudani said in a July interview with The Associated Press that once the coalition withdrawal is complete, “there will be no need or no justification for any group to carry weapons outside the scope of the state.”",

    "description": "An Iranian Kurdish separatist group in Iraq said it has launched attacks on Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard in recent days in retaliation for Tehran’s violent crackdown on protests.  Members of the National Army of Kurdistan, the armed wing of the Kurdistan Freedom Party, or PAK, have “played a role in the protests through both financial support and armed operations to defend protesters when needed,” Jwansher Rafati, a PAK representative, told The Associated Press on Thursday.",
    "fullText": "IRBIL, Iraq (AP) — An Iranian Kurdish separatist group in Iraq said it has launched attacks on Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard in recent days in retaliation for Tehran’s violent crackdown on protests.\n\nMembers of the National Army of Kurdistan, the armed wing of the Kurdistan Freedom Party, or PAK, have “played a role in the protests through both financial support and armed operations to defend protesters when needed,” Jwansher Rafati, a PAK representative, told The Associated Press on Thursday.\n\nIranian media has previously accused the group and other Kurdish factions of attacking security forces.\n\nIranian activists say more than 2,797 people were killed in the government’s crackdown on a recent wave of nationwide protests.\n\nA handful of Iranian Kurdish dissident or separatist groups — some with armed wings — have long found a safe haven in northern Iraq’s semiautonomous Kurdish region, where their presence has been a point of friction between the central government in Baghdad and Tehran.\n\nIran has occasionally launched strikes on the groups’ sites in Iraq but has not done so since the outbreak of the recent protests.\n\nThe PAK is the first of the groups to claim armed operations since the protests and crackdown began.\n\n“When we found out that the IRGC was shooting protesters directly, our fighters in Ilam, Kermanshah, and Firuzkuh responded with armed operations and inflicted significant damage on the regime’s forces,” Rafati said in an interview in Irbil, the capital of northern Iraq’s semiautonomous Kurdish region.\n\nThe PAK has also claimed a number of attacks online and posted video of what it said were operations against IRGC targets, sometimes accompanied by grainy videos showing gunshots or explosions and buildings ablaze. The AP was not able to confirm the extent of the damages or the impact of the attacks.\n\nRafati said the attacks were launched by members of the group’s National Army of Kurdistan military wing based inside Iran. The group had not sent any forces from Iraq, but it anticipates that Iran may strike PAK bases in Iraq in retaliation for its operations, he added.\n\nHe said the PAK has been providing support to dozens of Iranians who fled to the Kurdish area in Iraq since the crackdown on protests began.\n\nThe PAK claims may put Iraqi authorities in a sensitive situation with Tehran — which wields significant influence over its neighbor — concerning the group's ongoing presence in northern Iraq.\n\nIraq in 2023 reached an agreement with Iran to disarm Kurdish Iranian dissident groups and move them from their bases near the border areas into camps designated by Baghdad. The bases were shut down and movement within Iraq was restricted, but the groups have remained active.\n\nDuring the Israel-Iran war last year, the PAK and other Kurdish dissident groups began organizing politically in case the authorities in Tehran should lose their hold on power but did not launch armed operations.\n\nA PAK spokesperson told the AP at the time that premature armed mobilization could endanger the Kurdish groups and the fragile security of Kurdish areas, both in Iraq and across the border in Iran.\n\nA decade ago, PAK forces received training from the U.S. military when they were taking part in the fight against the Islamic State militant group after it swept across Iraq and Syria, seizing large swathes of territory.\n\nIronically, the PAK at the time found itself allied with Iran-backed Shiite Iraqi militias that were also fighting against IS.\n\nAt that time, the PAK received funding from Iraq's Kurdish regional government, but says now that most of its funding comes from its supporters in Iran and the diaspora.\n\nDuring the recent protests, Iranian state media has repeatedly referred to the demonstrators as “terrorists” and alleged they received support from America and Israel, without offering evidence to support the claim.\n\nIranian state television aired what appeared to be surveillance video of a group of men wearing the baggy pants common among the Kurds, firing pistols, in Iran’s western Kurdish region. It has also published images of seized weapons in the area.\n\nThe semiofficial Tasnim news agency, which is close to Iran's Revolutionary Guard, said Kurdish groups including the PAK “have played an active role in inciting these movements by issuing coordinated statements and messages.” It said that “groups based in northern Iraq have passed the stage of psychological warfare and media operations and have entered the field phase.”\n\nThe semiofficial Fars news agency, which is also close to the Revolutionary Guard, reported on Jan. 10 that another group — the Kurdistan Free Life Party, or PJAK — had killed eight Guard members in Kermanshah and that a PJAK sniper killed a police officer in Ilam province. PJAK has not claimed any armed operations during the protests.",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran's army chief threatened preemptive military action Wednesday over the “rhetoric” targeting the Islamic Republic, likely referring to U.S. President Donald Trump's warning that if Tehran “violently kills peaceful protesters,” the United States “will come to their rescue.\"\n\nThe comments by Maj. Gen. Amir Hatami come as Iran tries to respond to what it sees as a dual threat posed by Israel and the United States, as well as the protests sparked by its economic woes that have grown into a direct challenge to its theocracy.\n\nSeeking to halt the anger, Iran's government began Wednesday paying the equivalent of $7 a month to subsidize rising costs for dinner table essentials like rice, meat and pastas. Shopkeepers warn prices for items as basic as cooking oil likely will triple under pressure from the collapse of Iran's rial currency and the end of a preferential subsidized dollar-rial exchange rate for importers and manufacturers — likely fueling further popular anger.\n\n“More than a week of protests in Iran reflects not only worsening economic conditions, but longstanding anger at government repression and regime policies that have led to Iran’s global isolation,” the New York-based Soufan Center think tank said.\n\nHatami spoke to military academy students. He took over as commander in chief of Iran's army, known by the Farsi word \"Artesh,\" after Israel killed a number of the country's top military commanders in June's 12-day war. He is the first regular military officer in decades to hold a position long controlled by Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.\n\n“The Islamic Republic considers the intensification of such rhetoric against the Iranian nation as a threat and will not leave its continuation without a response,\" Hatami said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency.\n\nHe added, “I can say with confidence that today the readiness of Iran’s armed forces is far greater than before the war. If the enemy commits an error, it will face a more decisive response, and we will cut off the hand of any aggressor.”\n\nIranian officials, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have been responding to Trump's comments, which took on more significance after the U.S. military raid that seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a longtime ally of Tehran, over the weekend. But there's been no immediate public sign of Iran preparing for an attack in the region.\n\nIranian state television reported on the start of a new subsidy of the equivalent of $7, put into the bank accounts of heads of households across the country. More than 71 million people will receive the benefit, which is 10 million Iranian rials, it reported. The rial now trades at over 1.4 million to $1 and continues to depreciate.\n\nThe subsidy is more than double than the 4.5 million rial people previously received. But already, Iranian media report sharp rises in the cost of basic goods, including cooking oil, poultry and cheese, placing additional strain on households already burdened by international sanctions targeting the country and inflation.\n\nIran's vice president in charge of executive affairs, Mohammad Jafar Ghaempanah, told reporters on Wednesday that the country was in a “full-fledged economic war.” He called for “economic surgery” to eliminate rentier policies and corruption within the country.\n\nIran has faced rounds of nationwide protests in recent years. As sanctions tightened and Iran struggled after the June war with Israel, its rial currency sharply fell in December. Protests began soon after on Dec. 28. They reached their 11th day on Wednesday and didn't appear to be stopping.\n\nSocial media videos purported to show new cities like Bojnourd, Kerman, Rasht, Shiraz and Tabriz, as well some smaller towns, joining the demonstrations on Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency offered the latest death toll of 36 for the demonstrations. It said 30 protesters, four children and two members of Iran’s security forces have been killed. Demonstrations have reached over 310 locations in 28 of Iran’s 31 provinces. More than 2,100 people have been arrested, it said.\n\nThe group, which relies on an activist network inside of Iran for its reporting, has been accurate in past unrest.",

Instead of Rosenior, it will be interim head coach Calum McFarlane calling the shots, and hopefully just as effectively as he did over the weekend, when he engineered a very credible 1-1 draw away against Manchester City.\n\nAlas, the only team to truly benefit from that draw were Arsenal, who now have a six point lead at the top of the table, just past the halfway mark of the season.\n\nFor Chelsea, it’s now just one win in our last eight Premier League matches, collecting just eight points from the 24 on offer. Somehow we’re still in fifth, but we’re going to have to start picking up points if we want to remain in the Champions League places by season’s end.\n\nDate / Time: Wednesday, January 7, 19.30 GMT; 2:30pm EST; 1am IST (next day)\nVenue: Craven Cottage, SW6\nReferee: Peter Bankes (on pitch); John Brooks (VAR)\nForecast: Partly sunny and a slight breeze; no more snow sadly\n\nOn TV: Sky Sports Football (UK); none (USA); Star Sports Select HD2 (India); none (NGA); elsewhere\nStreaming: Sky Go (UK); Peacock (USA); JioHotstar (India); DStv Now, SuperSport GOtv (NGA)\n\nFulham team news: It’s been a decent festive period for midtable (as usual) Fulham, getting draws against Liverpool and Crystal Palace and wins against West Ham and Nottingham Forest. Their draw against Liverpool, last time out, saw both teams score in added-on time, with Fulham equalizing on a most unlikely Goal of the Season worldie from Harrison Reed: just his fourth goal in over 200 appearances for the club.\n\nHARRISON REED GOAL FROM ALL OF THE ANGLES WHAT A GOAL 😮‍💨👏🏻pic.twitter.com/DZGfsF6Srw\n\n— KinG £ (@xKGx__) January 4, 2026\n\nAnd they’ve done all that despite losing a trio of key players to Nigeria at the Africa Cup of Nations (Alex Iwobi, Calvin Bassey, and Samuel Chukwueze), and missing a few others through injury (Josh King, Kenny Tete, and Rodrigo Muniz). In better news for them, Ryan Sessegnon looks set to return from a hamstring problem.\n\nManager Marco Silva is weary of the mental and physical tolls these games have taken on his players, though such concerns can fall by the wayside when it comes to special derbies (even friendly ones), especially when one side may feel wronged by a certain decision (i.e. Josh King’s goal getting ruled in the reverse fixture at the Bridge earlier this season).\n\n“It’s special. It’s special, because we know what’s happened. […] It really hurt ourselves, our fans, this football club, the way we were not able to win the game at Stamford Bridge. The way the team performed almost perfectly first half, in a really tough game against a top, top side, the way the team performed, and everything that happened in that game, really hurt this football club. I’m not talking about one or two persons, or just the players – us, the football club, the way that things happened that Saturday morning.\n\n“It is what it is – now it’s another opportunity for us to enjoy, to embrace a big challenge with our fans to play a derby like a derby should be played. Simple as that. It’s a new game, a new story. I don’t want anyone to think about the past, we have to look for the future, and what’s going to be most important is the next one. It’s a special game.”\n\n-Marco Silva; \n\nChelsea team news: Robert Sánchez and Wesley Fofana were both late scratches over the weekend, with injury and illness, respectively, but they are both back in training and in contention to start. Same goes for Marc Cucurella, who’s barely ever injured, but has missed the last couple games with a hamstring concern. We also welcome back Moisés Caicedo from his latest suspension.\n\nLevi Colwill, Dário Essugo, and Roméo Lavia remain out. The club recently wished Mykhailo Mudryk a happy birthday on social media, so we should probably mention the suspended winger here as well. How’s the appeals process going, Misha?\n\nMcFarlane will be hoping to hand over the reigns to Rosenior with the team back on the right path.\n\n“[This is a] really talented group, young, hungry, have shown they can play at the top top level against top top sides. Anyone associated with the club should be proud of their performance on Sunday and moving forward, this team has massive, massive potential so we should all be excited.”\n\n-Calum McFarlane; \n\nPreviously: Last season, we went to Craven Cottage on a low and came back on an absolute high. Tyrique George’s late equalizer and Pedro Neto’s even-later winner galvanized the team into a scorching hot run of form and results, culminating in not only a top-four finish but winning the FIFA Club World Cup later that summer.",

    "description": "Popular German firearms maker Heckler & Koch didn't even compete.",
    "fullText": "The Bundeswehr, the German Armed Forces, has a history of fielding German-made firearms. After all, German firearms manufacturers are some of the best in the world, with Oberndorf-based Heckler & Koch being among the world’s largest manufacturers. With this in mind, it might be a bit of a surprise that the Bundeswehr announced the selection of the Czech-made CZ P-10C as the new German service pistol.\n\nPrevious Bundeswehr pistols include the Walter P38-derived P1 and the legendary H&K USP (as the P8), the A1 version of which is being replaced by the CZ as the P13. While the Germans have used foreign pistols in the past (including the ubiquitous Glock 17), the CZ P-10C represents the first adoption of a foreign pistol as a standard-issue sidearm. Interestingly, CZ’s competition in the final round was Austria’s Glock and Slovenia’s AREX, while H&K was not even in the running.\n\nOn Dec. 18, 2025, CZ announced that the company had “achieved one of the most significant milestones in its history” with the selection of the P-10C by the Bundeswehr. The specific model selected to serve as the P13 is the optics-ready version with a flat dark earth finish. Of course, the pistol is chambered in 9x19mm in accordance with NATO standardization… looking at you, M7 rifle.\n\nOtherwise, the P-10C is a fairly ordinary pistol by modern standards. It features a 4-inch barrel, a tilting barrel action, a short-recoil system, and is striker-fired. The pistol’s polymer frame includes an accessory rail and interchangeable backstraps, the barrel is cold-hammered forged, and the standard iron sights are night sights.\n\nFeeding from a standard 15-round magazine, the P-10C can also use CZ’s extended magazines, including the 17-round magazine, as well as magazines for the CZ P-07 pistol. The P-10C was adopted by the Army of the Czech Republic in 2020.\n\n“We are honored that the German Bundeswehr has chosen CZ as its partner. Our success in this rearmament tender is one of the most significant achievements in CZ’s modern history,” said CZ CEO Jan Zajic in a press release. “It clearly confirms the outstanding reputation our firearms have earned through active deployment in real combat conditions. We look forward to a long-term cooperation with the Bundeswehr and to fulfilling all its requirements in line with the contract.”\n\nNeither CZ nor the Bundeswehr announced the quantity or value of the P13 contract, nor did they provide a specific delivery timeline. However, the Bundeswehr has been undergoing an accelerated process of modernization since the 2022 full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. While sidearms do not contribute as much to combat power as artillery or rifles, the awarding of the P13 contract is still a significant step toward German military readiness.\n\nZhakfar Ahmadi, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty",

    "description": "A Pentagon watchdog says the Army and Navy misrepresented recruit test scores, exceeding federal limits on low scorers.",
    "fullText": "A new Pentagon Inspector General report says that the Army and Navy misrepresented the academic qualifications of some recruits, allowing both services to exceed federal limits on low-scoring enlistees.\n\nThe report, released earlier this month, is based on a yearlong review of the services' Future Soldier and Future Sailor preparatory courses, which are new \"pre-boot camps\" created in recent years.\n\nThe programs have helped the Army and Navy enlist more recruits amid a national recruiting crisis by taking applicants with low entrance exam scores or fitness shortfalls and aiming to prepare them for service — addressing the deficiencies — in a matter of weeks or months.\n\nThe Defense Department Inspector General found that the Army and Navy miscalculated the number of low-scoring recruits they enlisted by counting test scores earned after applicants completed the preparatory courses, rather than the scores they received before entering those programs.\n\nThat approach allowed both services to exceed federal limits on low-scoring recruits without notifying the Secretary of Defense, as required by the rule. The secretary has the authority to raise those limits, but must also inform Congress.\n\nThe Pentagon disputed the report's findings, arguing that the scores that should count are those earned at the end of the preparatory courses, not those taken beforehand.\n\n\"Improving a recruit's academic skills is a primary reason for creating the [Future Soldier and Future Sailor Preparatory Courses],\" William Fitzhugh, the acting assistant secretary of defense for manpower and reserve affairs, wrote in a memo to the inspector general. \"Improved academic skills, and the resulting AFQT scores, enable such recruits to pursue a broader range of occupations, which benefits them and the Military Services.\"\n\nFederal law caps the number of recruits who score low on the Armed Forces Qualification Test, known as Category IV applicants, at 4% of the total number of recruits who ship to boot camp each year. Category IV applicants score between the 10th and 30th percentiles on the exam, which assesses subjects such as reading comprehension, math, and mechanics.\n\nSuch recruits \"tend to exhibit below average trainability and on-the-job performance,\" the report said.\n\nThe cap is intended to ensure the services attract enough high-scoring recruits to fill technically demanding roles, such as cyber operations, intelligence, and special operations, as well as many logistics and administrative jobs that also require strong academic performance.\n\nHad the services used applicants' original test scores, the Navy would have classified more than 11% of its 2025 enlistments as Category IV recruits, compared with just over 7% when counting scores earned after the preparatory course. The Army also exceeded 10% of Category IV recruits, though the report did not say by how much.\n\nThe findings come as the Army and Navy begin to emerge from a yearslong recruiting crisis that left both services thousands of recruits short in recent years. Nearly three-quarters of American youth do not meet either the military's fitness or its academic requirements to qualify for service, and fewer than ever are likely to consider military careers, making innovative recruiting efforts critical.\n\nA previous inspector general report raised concerns about \"less restrictive testing standards\" in the Army's preparatory course and found that some participants struggled with English as a second language. The Pentagon also disputed those findings.",

    "fullText": "The person of interest detained in connection with the Brown University shooting, identified by law enforcement sources as Benjamin Erickson, is a decorated soldier who had served in a position at Arlington National Cemetery, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nErickson, a 24-year-old Wisconsin native, served as an infantry soldier in the US Army, where he passed sniper training, had experience with firearms instruction and had served as a rifleman between 2021 and 2024, according to the profile.\n\nErickson also received a good conduct medal, participated in “security duties” near the president and assisted with funeral ceremonies at Arlington, the profile stated.\n\nThe LinkedIn page stated he planned to continue his college education at Brown University in the fall 2025 semester.\n\nA spokesperson for the US Army said Erickson had no deployments and left last year with the rank of specialist. Brown University did not immediately respond to questions about Erickson’s record.\n\nAuthorities said the person of interest was not a current student at Brown, but law enforcement sources indicated to CNN that he might have been recently enrolled.\n\nErickson took online classes with a focus on psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee after graduating from high school in July 2020, and then transferred to Brown for this fall semester after his military service ended, according to the profile, which noted a variety of interests including animal welfare, veteran support and helping the poor.\n\nThe profile further noted that he had interned as a carpenter and helped out at a horse rescue center.\n\nA staff member at the rescue, the Gentle Giants Draft Horse Rescue in Maryland, told CNN that Erickson was part of an Army unit that learned horse handling techniques at the rescue center between 2023 and 2024. Erickson was training with the Caisson Detachment of the US Army’s 3d US Infantry Regiment, the staff member said – a unit that provides escorts for military and state funerals.\n\nA high school yearbook included a photo of Erickson on his school’s wrestling team. A profile on X that appeared to belong to Erickson posted in 2016 and 2017 about wrestling, music and political satire.\n\nOne of Erickson’s former high school classmates, Bryce Jankowski, said he recently exchanged texts with Erickson, who said he was studying at Brown.\n\n“He said he was doing good,” Jankowski said. “He said he was living at a hotel because his apartment flooded,” though he said that did not seem to bother him.\n\nJankowski described Erickson as a well-behaved, smart individual. He did not recall Erickson making any concerning statements, harboring extremist views or having any behavioral challenges. “He was wicked smart.”\n\nAfter high school, he said Erickson had told him that he was in sniper school with the US military.\n\nA former wrestling teammate from high school, who asked not to be quoted by name, described Erickson as a “pretty nice guy, he was quiet… he becomes really outgoing when you get to know him, but he’s pretty quiet when you don’t.”\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, CNN observed the FBI at a Wisconsin home owned by Erickson’s family.\n\nA search of court databases showed no clear criminal history for Erickson aside from a 2023 case in which he was cited for driving on a sidewalk, a charge that was dismissed.\n\nCNN’s Bill Kirkos, Thomas Bordeaux and Jeff Winter contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Is there nothing he can’t do? President Donald Trump has astounded viewers of the 126th Army-Navy football game with his unique approach to flipping a coin.\n\nWhile officiating the customary coin toss at the historic football clash at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, Maryland, Trump demonstrated a bizarre heaving motion that resulted in almost no actual flipping of the coin itself.\n\nTaking the coin with a pinched left hand, and placing it into the open palm of his right, the president heaved the coin forward, sending it in a feeble, plunging arc. Helpfully, he pointed out where the coin had landed after it hit the ground.\n\nViewers immediately expressed their surprise at this pioneering method of coin-based decision-making.\n\n“Donald Trump may have executed the single worst coin flip in history,” wrote former independent congressional candidate Hal Stewart. “That coin is headed to the hall of shame!”\n\n“President Trump with the unprecedented coin toss that doesn’t appear to flip at all,” wrote author and radio host Clay Travis.\n\n“Donald Trump flips a coin like a pansy,” added political commentator Ed Krassenstein.\n\nHowever, the shock and surprise may be unwarranted as Trump has form in this area. In fact, as he has previously demonstrated, the president appears to believe that this is exactly how coins are flipped.\n\nIn 2018, Trump demonstrated his idiosyncratic style at that year’s Army-Navy Game, drawing critical fire from then-MSNBC host Chris Hayes.\n\n“Why is everything with this president so weird and so awkward?” Hayes asked. “Flipping a coin is not some great feat of athletics.”\n\n“To flip a coin, you just have to, uh, flip the coin. You use the thumb, you flick it into the air, get a good rotation going, let it land on the ground, see if it’s heads or tails.”\n\nThe All In host described Trump’s efforts as how one might release a baby bird into the air.\n\nThe Army Black Knights correctly called the coin in Saturday’s game tails. That did not, however, help them win, as the Navy Shipmen beat them in a close 17-16 game.",
