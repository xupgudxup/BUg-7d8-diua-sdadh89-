    "fullText": "Chipmaker’s quarterly earnings surpassed Wall Street’s expectations every quarter for multiple years now\n\nNvidia released its quarterly earnings on Wednesday, with the chipmaker revealing higher than expected revenues and extending its yearslong streak of surpassing Wall Street’s sky-high expectations.\n\nThe company receives the vast majority of its revenue from its data center business, which has been buoyed by the tech industry’s immense investment into AI infrastructure. On Wednesday, Nvidia reported 75% year-over-year growth of this vertical to $62.3bn. The world’s most valuable publicly traded company, Nvidia has dominated the chip market as its processing units have become the backbone of the artificial intelligence boom. The company also posted an enormous total profit for the fiscal year: $120bn.\n\n“Our customers are racing to invest in AI compute – the factories powering the AI industrial revolution and their future growth,” CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement accompanying the earnings report.\n\nInvestors have been more skeptical in recent months regarding the massive amount of spending that big tech companies have poured into advancing their AI products, with share prices for most of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech firms starting the year off in decline. Nvidia’s growth, meanwhile, has acted as a reassurance to the market, with a stock rally on Wednesday ahead of the company’s earnings report. Throughout the 2024 and 2025 fiscal years, Nvidia beat Wall Street’s expectations every quarter.\n\nThe chipmaker reported earnings of $1.62 per share, beating the $1.53 per share that Wall Street analysts estimated. Its overall revenue for the quarter was $68.13bn, more than analysts’ prediction of $66.2bn in revenue.\n\nShares in the company rose by around 3% in after-hours trading immediately following the earnings report, although those gains dropped to less than 1% as the day went on.\n\nDespite Nvidia’s huge profits, there has been increased scrutiny of the company’s various multibillion dollar deals with AI firms like OpenAI. The circular nature of these deals, where Nvidia invests in a company only for that company to turn around and purchase chips from Nvidia, has led some analysts to worry that the AI industry is on riskier footing than its backers would admit.\n\nOne of Nvidia’s marquee deals, a proposed $100bn investment into OpenAI, also fell through earlier this month. Instead, Nvidia will reportedly invest $30bn into OpenAI as the ChatGPT creator seeks to go public later this year at a valuation of around $730bn.\n\n“We continue to work with OpenAI towards a partnership agreement, and believe we are close,” Huang said on Wednesday’s earnings call.\n\nHuang has repeatedly downplayed concerns around how AI will disrupt or replace workers across numerous industries. Last month, Huang spoke out against fears of AI replacing software technologies during a global rush to sell off software stocks. At the World Economic Forum in Davos earlier this year, he also framed AI as a job creator that would unlock productivity gains and become a core part of international infrastructure.\n\n“In this new world of AI, compute equals revenues,” Huang said on the call.\n\nAfter years of markets swooning over advances in generative AI, however, some investors have grown more skittish and wary of volatility or potential negative effects that AI may have on the economy. This week, a piece of speculative fiction from a research firm caused a market downturn and panic on Wall Street after it outlined an imagined future where AI had caused surging unemployment.",

    "fullText": "Feb 25 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Nvidia posted better-than-expected results for the January quarter on Wednesday and forecast current-quarter revenue above market estimates, betting on Big Tech's unabated spending on its artificial-intelligence processors.\n\nBut its stock traded flat after hours, as investors, used to solid revenue beats from the ‌company for 14 straight quarters, were likely disappointed by the uneventful results that were released 10 minutes after the expected time.\n\nOn the post-earnings conference call, UBS ‌analyst Tim Arcuri asked executives whether Nvidia was looking to give back to shareholders some of the $100 billion cash it was likely to generate this year, because \"no matter how good the results have been, the stock hasn't really ​gone up much.\" In response, Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said the company wanted to keep investing in the AI ecosystem.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang said the output generated by AI models would be the foundation of future computing and Nvidia would keep building more infrastructure to support that. \"This new way of doing computing is not going to go back,\" he said.\n\nSeeking to alleviate concerns that a supply crunch at its chip contract maker TSMC was getting in the way of its growth, Nvidia said it had secured enough chip inventory and capacity to meet demand beyond ‌the next several quarters. The shortage, though, will affect its gaming ⁠business, the company said.\n\nThe world's most valuable company expects fiscal first-quarter sales of $78 billion, plus or minus 2%, compared with analysts' average estimate of $72.60 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\n\"This was a good beat and raise, the usual for Nvidia, but based on the reactions preliminarily, it ⁠seems a lot was baked in to the cake so far,\" said Ken Mahoney, CEO at Mahoney Asset Management, which holds shares of Nvidia.\n\nThe fourth-quarter results are good news for AI investors, who are looking to Nvidia's performance to gauge whether the hundreds of billions of dollars that Big Tech is pouring into data center infrastructure are paying off. Hyperscalers including Meta Platforms - a big Nvidia ​customer - ​have forecast total capital expenditure of at least $630 billion in 2026, with most of the spending earmarked ​for data centers and processors.\n\n\"It’s clear from Nvidia’s latest numbers and their ‌forecast that concerns about an AI slowdown simply are not showing up yet,\" said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research.",

    "description": "Anthropic has become a boogeyman on Wall Street, with Claude's capabilities slamming various stock sectors. Deutsche says software will survive.",
    "fullText": "Deutsche Bank isn't concerned about what's become one of the most feared names on Wall Street: Claude.\n\nAnthropic is the market's newest boogeyman, as its updates and announcements about its AI chatbot have sparked panic about the potential disruption to everything from software to trucking.\n\nSoftware stocks have been among the most impacted, taking sizable losses as investors wonder if the sector is doomed to be cannibalized by AI.\n\nFollowing Anthropic's briefing on Tuesday, though, Deutsche Bank analysts maintain their positive outlook on the software industry. In fact, they see Anthropic's progress and the broader advent of AI as a likely positive catalyst for the tech sector, even as AI fears continue to sway the market.\n\n\"After watching Anthropic's Enterprise Agents briefing event, we have even greater conviction that model providers are unlikely to displace software incumbents and are instead positioning themselves and their agents to be an orchestration layer on top of existing and incumbent systems,\" wrote analyst Brad Zelnick in a note to clients.\n\nHis team's core thesis regarding Anthropic's long-term impact on software centers around the argument that, despite the recent focus on AI disruption, the technology still should not be seen as a substitute for entire systems.\n\n\"Various partnership announcements earlier in the day (including Intuit) along with mentioning the importance of data and context that live in the various systems of record and engagement suggest that it remains very difficult to replicate or displace much of the knowledge, metadata, and workflows incumbent systems have amassed,\" Zelnick wrote.\n\nWhile Deutsche does see some risk for software stocks, their overall view on the industry is optimistic that the rise of AI will broadly lift software makers.\n\nTheir view is a stark contrast to that of some finance and investing pros. Renowned statistician and author Nassim Taleb recently predicted that software bankruptcies are coming and stock gains of recent years could be wiped out. Yet, Deutsche maintains the bullish view that the market has room for both software and AI winners.\n\n\"We continue to see this as positive for the infrastructure/compute layer given the increase in queries by humans/agents against underlying enterprise data,\" Zelnick noted.",

    "fullText": "US stock futures crept below the baseline late Wednesday as Wall Street sifted through fresh quarterly results from chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) to provide a steer on the next leg of the AI trade.\n\nContracts linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F) edged down 0.1%. Futures for the S&P 500 (ES=F) and Nasdaq 100 futures (NQ=F) both fell around 0.3%.\n\nThe cautious tone in futures followed a solid session for equities. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) advanced on Wednesday, marking its second straight gain. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) both ended the day in the green.\n\nIn extended trading, Nvidia (NVDA) shares jumped before giving up those gains. The semiconductor giant topped Wall Street expectations for Q4 profit and revenue, soothing some fears around the \"AI scare trade\" that has gripped markets this year. By contrast, Salesforce (CRM) sank roughly 5%, continuing an AI-driven sell-off that's seen the company drop around 28% year-to-date.\n\nTechnology and software stocks led the rebound during regular trading. Oracle (ORCL) and all members of the “Magnificent Seven” notched gains. Those gains came despite President Trump announcing during his State of Union address that he is expecting Big Tech to foot an ever-increasing electricity bill from data centers.\n\nLooking ahead on the economic calendar, investors will parse weekly jobless claims data due Thursday, followed by January’s producer price index report on Friday.\n\nWall Street also continues to see earnings come through, with quarterly results from Warner Bros.

    "title": "Goldman Sachs' top DEI executive exits for rival as Wall Street retreats from diversity under the Trump administration",
    "description": "Megan Hogan, a high-profile voice on Goldman's social impact initiatives, is headed to Morgan Stanley this spring, Business Insider has learned.",
    "fullText": "Goldman Sachs' top diversity official has left for a rival in recent weeks, multiple people familiar with the matter told Business Insider. Her exit comes as Wall Street retreats from long-stated DEI pledges about hiring and career advancement.\n\nMegan Hogan, Goldman's global co-head of talent left in January for Morgan Stanley, several people familiar with the matter said. Hogan, who joined the firm nearly 12 years ago, held the title of chief diversity officer until early 2025 before taking on the broader talent position for the past year.\n\nHogan confirmed the move via email on Tuesday, telling Business Insider that Morgan Stanley had extended her \"an amazing opportunity\" in talent development, which will begin when her garden leave expires. She declined to comment further.\n\nAt Morgan Stanley, Hogan will serve as head of talent development, reporting to Susan Reid, the firm's global head of talent. Hogan will begin in April, a person familiar with the hire said.\n\nLike other Wall Street banks, Goldman Sachs spent years investing in workforce diversity initiatives, and Hogan was one of its most prominent faces focused on social impact issues. But when President Donald Trump returned to power last January, he issued an executive order ending DEI programming at government agencies and urging companies to follow suit. Goldman, like many of its peers, has since taken steps to scrub DEI language from public-facing materials.\n\nEarlier this month, the bank also agreed to remove race, gender identity, and sexual orientation from its board-member selection criteria following pressure from a conservative shareholder group, the Wall Street Journal reported. It also stopped highlighting specific DEI targets in annual reports, a practice that had been a staple of its post-2020 communications, and said it would sunset the \"aspirational hiring goals\" it established half a decade ago.\n\n\"This is a reflection of the changing legal environment and adapting to the reality of those legal shifts,\" a spokesperson for the bank told Business Insider, adding that the firm stands by the benefit of \"diverse perspectives and experiences,\" and is following the law while running programs designed to \"attract the best talent.\"\n\nLater this week, the bank is expected to name Lauren Uranker, another managing director who joined the firm about 14 years ago, as the new sole head of talent development, engagement, and management, according to a person with close knowledge of the bank's thinking. Uranker was appointed global co-head of talent alongside Hogan in mid-2025.\n\nIn her new position, Uranker's mandate is expected to concentrate on the transition to AI-supported work, team growth, and finding ways to engage and retain top employees. Her title has no direct references to DEI, but the position will still encompass programming designed to advance workplace inclusion, the source added.\n\nCorporate America — including financial services firms such as JPMorgan, Citi, and Morgan Stanley— has eased use of the term \"DEI\" and associated language since early 2025. The Trump administration's rebuke of diversity-related programming continues to serve as a point of pride for Trump, who touted the crackdown during his State of the Union address to lawmakers on Tuesday night. \"We ended DEI in America,\" he said.\n\nGoldman had previously been among Wall Street's most vocal advocates for promoting inclusion in the workplace. In 2020, David Solomon, the bank's CEO, championed a series of policies like requiring companies to appoint diverse board members before his bankers would agree to help them go public — a rule the company killed last year. Stephanie Cohen, the bank's former chief strategy officer who departed in 2024, told Business Insider in 2020 that Goldman viewed these issues as more than perfunctory but vital for commercial success.\n\nHogan's predecessor, Erika Irish Brown, left for Citi in 2021 to lead DEI efforts there. Following Brown's departure, Hogan — who previously held the titles of head of Americas talent management and global head of diversity recruiting — assumed the chief diversity officer title the same year, but last year consolidated primarily on her \"global co-head of talent\" designation. Her exit compounds another long-standing struggle for the Wall Street bank: retaining senior female leaders. Goldman has faced blowback over whether it's done enough to support their career progress — an area where officials have acknowledged there's room for improvement.\n\nThough the firm has increased the total share of female managing directors by 3% since 2021, a spokesperson said, Solomon acknowledged this past fall that there was further to go. \"We've made a bunch of progress, especially in the senior ranks,\" he said at the Economic Club of Washington in October. But the results, he added, were \"candidly not enough, and we continue to be focused on creating opportunities.\"\n\nHave a tip?

They are shifting millions of dollars into defensive positions and speculative bets.\n\nThis urgent movement follows a series of shocks that have left the global financial system on edge.\n\nThe market tension traces back to a major legal blow delivered last week on Feb. 20.\n\nIn a 6–3 decision, the US Supreme Court ruled that Trump exceeded his authority when he used the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of countries.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote:\n\n“We hold that IEEPA does not authorize the president to impose tariffs.”\n\nTrump first launched the tariff wave on April 2, 2025, a day he branded “Liberation Day.” His administration argued that persistent US trade deficits constituted a national emergency, allowing him to bypass Congress under IEEPA.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling specifically invalidated tariffs imposed under IEEPA but left intact sector-based tariffs enacted under other trade laws.\n\nTrump called the decision “deeply disappointing” and insisted the Court had only limited one legal pathway. In a TruthSocial post, he wrote:\n\n“As President, I do not have to go back to Congress to get approval of Tariffs. It has already been gotten, in many forms, a long time ago!”\n\nWithin hours, Trump signed a proclamation invoking Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to impose a new 10% global tariff for up to 150 days, later stating he would raise it to 15%.\n\nMajor gold giant shrinks as Trump-linked firm surges\n\nRich Dad Poor Dad buys Bitcoin again\n\nViral AI agent bans ‘Bitcoin,' ‘crypto’ mentions\n\nUS stock futures turned lower, with S&P 500 futures down roughly 0.8% and Nasdaq futures off about 1% following the renewed tariff push.

    "description": "The wealthy are becoming worried about the US economy more rapidly than lower-income households. A Wall Street veteran says it's that's bullish for stocks.",
    "fullText": "The S&P 500 could be set to break out of its anemic trading range, according to a veteran Wall Street strategist.\n\nThe key metric to watch isn't some piece of technical analysis or a big earnings update. Rather, it's the growing feeling of economic unease among high-earning Americans, according to Jim Paulsen.\n\nThe S&P 500 is roughly flat since the start of 2026 as investors weigh the market impact of Trump's uncertain tariff regime and AI disruption fears. Jim Paulsen, former chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group, says his new market indicator, which he dubs the poor/rich sentiment measure, has successfully forecast recent market rallies and is signaling a potential upswing is on the horizon.\n\nLower-income households were seen by forecasters as a weak spot in the economy for some time, but their mood has been brightening of late. At the same time, high earners have become more downbeat. This narrowing of the sentiment gap, Paulsen says, is a buy signal.\n\nPaulsen compares consumer confidence in the economy by income level to find a daily confidence ratio that he then combines with a ratio of Walmart's stock performance relative to the S&P Global Luxury stock price index.\n\nPaulsen overlaid his poor/rich sentiment indicator over the S&P 500 to assess it as an indicator for market performance.\n\n\"The Poor/Rich sentiment indicator has spiked higher 8 previous times since 2018 — in late-2018, October 2019, March 2020, May 2022, October 2022, November 2023, September 2024, and in April 2025. During each of these previous spikes in the Poor/Rich sentiment indicator, the S&P 500 was at a level which represented a good buy! \"\n\nSince the end of 2025, Paulsen's indicator has climbed. The measure's spike since December shares similarities with increases seen at the end of the 2022 bear market and at the 2020 pandemic lows.\n\nThe strategist ties the indicator's success to the idea that if the high-income cohort is losing faith in the economy, then the stock market is often at a low point. Paulsen highlights a downturn in Bloomberg's US billionaires relative total return index, which he says could be a signal that the rich are losing faith in the market.\n\n\"We seem to be in a relatively rare period when the Rich are losing confidence faster than the Poor … when the rich start complaining more than the poor, it's often been a good time to step up and buy some equities,\" the strategist said.\n\nPaulsen warned investors against using a single gauge, but said it may be a good time to assess equity exposure.\n\n\"If you are underinvested, perhaps it's worth considering taking advantage of recent volatility by adding to your equity exposure during selloffs,\" he wrote on his Substack post.",

    "fullText": "Fears of a software apocalypse are pummeling markets again to start the week.\n\nUS stocks dropped on Monday as traders reacted to new tariff uncertainty, while software in particular was pummeled by renewed fears of AI disruption prompted by a downgrade of Salesforce stock and a note making the rounds that theorized the AI boom could ultimately lead to a white-collar recession and a stock crash.\n\nMajor indexes lost more than 1% as investors continued to digest recent trade policy changes, including President Donald Trump's announcement over the weekend that he would hike global tariffs to 15%. The announcement came a day after the Supreme Court knocked down most of his earlier tariffs.\n\nThe Dow lost more than 800 points as selling ramped up around midday.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood around noon ET on Monday:\n\n\"Tariff uncertainty reigned this morning, pushing stocks to early losses and raising volatility on Wall Street,\" Joe Mazzola, the head trading and derivatives strategist at Charles Schwab, wrote in a note on Monday.\n\nInvestors also turned a more critical eye toward the software sector. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF, which tumbled into a bear market earlier this year, was down another 5%. The fund is now down nearly 30% in 2026.\n\nHere were some of the notable moves on Monday:\n\nChatter about an AI-fueled meltdown picked up on Monday after the firm Citrini Research published a report outlining a hypothetical 2028 scenario in which the AI boom could trigger a recession and a stock market crash in the next couple of years.\n\n\"The system turned out to be one long daisy chain of correlated bets on white-collar productivity growth,\" the note said. \"The November 2027 crash only served to accelerate all of the negative feedback loops already in place.\"\n\nThe fresh AI jitters also brought capex spending back into the spotlight, with investors awaiting a key update this week in the form of Nvidia's coming earnings report due out on Wednesday.\n\n\"I think it's really just an AI story at this point for the market,\" Peter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research, told Business Insider, referring to concerns about large capex spending despite unclear monetization plans at some firms. \"It's a question of whether investors are going to revolt against all the massive spending on AI data centers that we're having now.\"\n\nMark Hackett, the chief markets strategist at Nationwide, attributed much of the volatility to \"continued skepticism\" over AI and fresh tariff uncertainty.\n\n\"Hedge funds have aggressively moved to the sidelines, with net sales of US equities at the fastest pace since last March this month, and net leverage tracking to be the second largest sharpest monthly decline in a decade,\" he wrote in a note on Tuesday.\n\nInvestors will likely turn their attention to key tech earnings this week, with Nvidia and Salesforce reporting their results on Wednesday, Schwab's Mazzola said.",

    "description": "Investors are rotating out of the most popular tech stocks. Here's where they are finding gains.",
    "fullText": "Investors have shifted their appetite from tech and megacaps into sectors that have been playing “catch-up” and benefiting from AI-fueled investments.\n\nStocks broke a two-week losing streak on Friday, but year to date, Tech (XLK) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), along with Financials (XLF), remain negative.\n\nHow is AI disruption affecting different market sectors?\n\nWhy are investors rotating away from tech stocks?\n\nWhat factors could drive continued market broadening?\n\nWhich sectors are benefiting from the tech rotation?\n\n\"Money's coming out of this big behemoth. Money's moving out of tech,\" Truist chief investment officer and chief market strategist Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance.\n\nLerner noted the rotation away from Magnificent Seven giants like Microsoft (MSFT), e-commerce and cloud leader Amazon (AMZN), and EV maker Tesla (TSLA).\n\nMeanwhile, sectors that underperformed last year have been making big gains.\n\nEnergy stocks (XLE) are up 22% since the start of the year. Rising oil prices and continued demand for oil have sent shares of Chevron (CVX) and ExxonMobil (XOM) up 20% and 22%, respectively.\n\nMaterials (XLB) and Industrial stocks (XLI) are also up 15% and 14% as AI infrastructure buildouts and reshoring accelerate.\n\nMeanwhile, investors have turned to defensive areas of the market like Consumer Staples (XLP), with consumer giant Walmart (WMT) hitting an all-time high earlier this month.\n\nAlthough portfolio rebalancing — where investors shift from overvalued sectors into more stable areas — typically happens at the start of the year, this year’s rotation has been amplified by volatility.\n\nA sell-off in pockets of the tech sector began last month amid fears that artificial intelligence could take over tasks traditionally handled by enterprise software companies.\n\nThe Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) is down 23% year to date.\n\nThe \"AI scare trade\" has now spread from software to wealth management and logistics.\n\nCybersecurity firms were the latest to get hit on Friday after Anthropic announced a new security tool. Shares of CrowdStrike (CRWD) dropped 5%, while Zscaler (ZS) and Cloudflare (NET) also fell 4% and 6%, respectively.\n\n“Everyone's kind of going through each one, sector by sector, industry by industry, trying to figure out where the AI disruption is going to be beyond just within tech itself,” Lerner said.\n\nProfit growth and the easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve should help the stock market continue to broaden. Polymarket betters are predicting two to three rate cuts in 2026. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance has a partnership with Polymarket.)\n\n\"With the easing cycle still intact, and the US economy showing resilience ... we expect healthy and broadening profit growth across sectors,\" UBS strategists said on Thursday.",

    "fullText": "Title: Head of global mergers and acquisitions\n\nTotal deal value: $153.4 billion\n\nHogan joined Wells Fargo in May 2023 after a 27-year career at Morgan Stanley, where he served as the star technology banker and co-head of global technology M&A. Since his arrival, he has been a primary architect of the bank's meteoric rise in the advisory rankings, helping Wells Fargo jump from 17th place in 2024 to 9th place in 2025, according to LSEG's league table for global M&A. This year marks Hogan's inaugural appearance as a rainmaker.\n\nTotal deal value: $149.2 billion\n\nAfter a decade as global head of M&A at Barclays, Posternack became the practice's chairman in 2024. Spending more time advising top clients has paid off, as Posternack is on the Rainmakers list for the second year running, adding nearly $200 billion in deal value in a career and ranking No. 2 overall this year. Posternack's decorated career spans nearly four decades. After getting his start at Dillon, Read & Co. in the 1980s, he joined Lehman Brothers in 1995; Barclays acquired Lehman in 2008 during the financial crisis.\n\nBaronoff has been chairman of global M&A at Merrill Lynch since 2000, overseeing the business. He originally joined Merrill Lynch in 1986 and has held various leadership roles, including head of retail and consumer M&A. His 2025 performance was marked by high-volume advisory roles in the transportation, consumer goods, and infrastructure sectors. This is Baronoff's second appearance on the Rainmakers list.\n\nTitle: Co-head of technology, media, and telecommunications investment banking\n\nTotal deal value: 122.8 billion\n\nBritton serves as the co-head of TMT investment banking at Goldman Sachs, where he has led the firm's coverage of the red-hot tech sector for over two decades. Based in San Francisco, his 2025 activity encompassed transactions in the gaming, enterprise software, and artificial intelligence sectors. Notably, Britton acted as a key advisor during OpenAI's transition to a public benefit corporation. This marks Britton's fourth appearance on the Rainmakers list.\n\nTitle: Co-head of US investment banking\n\nTotal deal value: $116.5 billion\n\nMendelow joined Evercore in 2001 and has risen through the ranks over the past 25 years, advising on a slew of communications, media, and technology deals. Along with Naveen Nataraj (No. 15), he was promoted to co-lead US investment banking in 2020 and sits on the management committee. This is his first year on the Rainmakers list.\n\nTitle: Global chairman of investment banking and M&A\n\nTotal deal value: $113.5 billion\n\nVentresca has spent more than three-and-a-half decades at JPMorgan and has served as global chair of JPMorgan's investment banking business since 2020, according to LinkedIn. A third-time rainmaker, Ventresca has advised on deals across a range of industries, from industrials to consumer retail.\n\nTotal deal value: $113.3 billion\n\nEffron co-founded Centerview Partners in 2006, establishing the firm as a prominent independent advisor to the world's elite corporations, offering big-bank power within the boutique banking landscape.\n\nOver a career spanning four decades, he has advised on complex strategic mergers and high-profile activism defenses across the media, consumer, and industrial sectors. His 2025 activity included leading roles in major media-sector consolidations and significant industrial-technology acquisitions. This marks Effron's fourth appearance on the Rainmakers list.\n\nTitle: Global head of advisory and M&A\n\nTotal deal value: $105.2 billion\n\nAiyengar has been at JPMorgan for decades and became the head of advisory and M&A in 2024. She's advised on more than a trillion dollars' worth of deals — from ones involving investment bank Morgan Stanley to ones involving luxury giant LVMH — and topped last year's Rainmakers list.\n\nIn addition to being involved in initiatives to mentor women at JPMorgan, Aiyengar is considered one of the financial services industry's most influential female leaders.\n\nTitle: Chairman of Global M&A, Corporate & Investment Banking\n\nTotal deal value: $97.1 billion\n\nDavid DeNunzio has been at Wells Fargo since 2016. Before coming to Wells Fargo, he spent decades at Credit Suisse and years at Kidder, Peabody in the 1980s. This is DeNunzio's first year on the Rainmakers list.\n\nTotal deal value: $94.7 billion\n\nMahmoodzadegan helped founder Ken Moelis launch Moelis & Company in 2007 and has been central to building the boutique into a heavyweight advisor on marquee deals. A former attorney, he moved into investment banking at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in 1995 and joined UBS in 2001, rising to global head of media investment banking. The longtime co-president took the helm as CEO in October 2025, as Moelis shifted to executive chairman under a planned leadership transition. This is his first time on the Rainmakers list.\n\nTitle: Co-chairman, global mergers and acquisitions\n\nTotal transaction value: $87.5 billion\n\nIngrassia is a 40-year veteran of Goldman Sachs, currently serving as the co-chairman of global M&A. He previously held leadership roles as the head of Americas M&A and the consumer retail group. His 2025 activity was defined by high-value transactions in the consumer health and retail sectors, as well as notable advisory roles in professional sports and media. This is Ingrassia's sixth appearance on the Rainmakers list.\n\nTitle: Vice chairman, investment banking\n\nTotal deal value: More than $80 billion\n\nNelson Walsh has spent nearly four decades at Morgan Stanley, where he's now the vice chairman of investment banking. This is Walsh's first time on the Rainmakers list.\n\nTitle: Founder and managing partner\n\nTotal value of deals: $82.5 billion\n\nCardinale founded RedBird in 2014 after 20 years at Goldman Sachs, where he was a partner in the merchant banking division. The sports, media, and financial services investor has since made several high-profile investments, including David Ellison's Skydance Media, and completed transactions, including the acquisition of Italian soccer club AC Milan. Under Cardinale's leadership, RedBird has grown to manage about $14 billion in assets for major global institutions and family offices. This year marks Cardinale's first time on the Rainmakers list.\n\nTotal deal value: $81.8 billion\n\nKlein now runs his own boutique advisory firm, but he was once one of the most prominent big bank M&A chiefs. He joined Salomon Brothers in the 1980s, which became part of Citigroup in the late 1990s. At Citi, he held top roles in the investment bank and was viewed as a contender for CEO before his departure in 2008. He went on to launch M. Klein & Co., advising on high-profile transactions, and has also launched several special purpose acquisition companies, so-called \"blank check\" companies.\n\nThis is Klein's first year on the Rainmakers list, thanks to his advisory role on the year's most contentious megadeal:\n\nTitle: Co-head of US investment banking\n\nTotal deal value: $75.6 billion\n\nThis is Nataraj's third year on the Rainmakers list. The technology, media, and telecommunications banker joined Evercore in 2002 and, like Daniel Mendelow (No. 5), was promoted to lead US investment banking in 2020 and is a member of the firm's management committee.\n\nTitle: Head of financial institutions group M&A, Co-Head of media & communications M&A\n\nLoriferne has been at JPMorgan since 2006 and made the Rainmakers list for the first time last year, when he advised on deals involving BlackRock and Nippon Life.\n\nTitle: Partner and co-president of investment banking\n\nTotal value of deals: $71.2 billion\n\nCenterview's Tokat had one of the most active healthcare M&A years on Wall Street. Advising exclusively on the sell side, he worked across biotech, pharmaceuticals, and specialty therapeutics transactions, helping companies secure premium exits in a market that rewarded innovation and strategic consolidation. This year marks Tokat's second appearance.\n\nTotal value of deals: $68.5 billion\n\nIn 2025, Pruzan's performance was anchored by leading complex advisory projects across multiple industries simultaneously. Most notably, he led the year's largest consumer healthcare divestiture: the $49 billion acquisition of Kenvue, formerly Johnson & Johnson's consumer health division, by Kimberly-Clark. He has advised on more than $1 trillion worth of transactions over his career, Centerview says. This year marks Pruzan's first entry on the list.\n\nTitle: Co-head of M&A, Americas\n\nTotal deal value: $66.8 billion\n\nMahdavi joined Morgan Stanley in 2012, after previous stints at Deutsche Bank and Citi. She's spent her whole career working in mergers and acquisitions, and was promoted to co-lead Morgan Stanley's M&A business in the Americas at the beginning of last year. This year marks her second as a rainmaker.\n\nTitle: Chairman of investment banking\n\nTotal value of deals: $61 billion\n\nFrost's elevation to chairman of investment banking in January followed his leadership on several of the consumer sector's most significant recent transactions. Over the past year, he guided Goldman Sachs in completing the two largest deals in the consumer retail space, including the transformational nearly $49 billion Kenvue acquisition. This year marks Frost's first appearance on the Rainmakers list.",

    "description": "If the nation's central bank loses credibility, it's Wall Street and investors that pay the price.",
    "fullText": "From a purely data-based standpoint, the stock market has been practically unstoppable with Donald Trump in the White House. Although there have been periods of historic volatility, such as the five-week COVID-19 crash in February-March 2020, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), benchmark S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and technology-driven Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) soared 57%, 70%, and 142%, respectively, during Trump's first term.\n\nThe stock market's outperformance has continued since President Trump's second, non-consecutive term began on Jan. 20, 2025, with the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq climbing by 14%, 15%, and 16%, respectively, as of the closing bell on Feb. 18, 2026.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nThis Trump bull market has been fueled by an assortment of factors, such as the rise of artificial intelligence and the advent of quantum computing, as well as policies and proposals directly linked to Trump.\n\nFor example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Trump's flagship tax and spending law from his first term) permanently lowered the peak marginal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the lowest level since 1939. With businesses keeping more of their income, it's led to record share buybacks from S&P 500 companies -- more than $1 trillion estimated for 2025. Share repurchases can increase earnings per share for public companies with steady or growing net income.\n\nAlthough the Trump bull market may appear infallible, several headwinds are threatening to pull the rug out from beneath it. While some of these catalysts are well known, such as tariff-related uncertainty and historically high stock valuations, the eventual undoing of the Trump bull market may be a surprise culprit: the Federal Reserve.\n\nNormally, the Federal Reserve is Wall Street's financial bedrock. It's America's foremost financial institution tasked with maximizing employment and stabilizing prices. It achieves these goals by adjusting the federal funds target rate -- the overnight lending rate between financial institutions -- and/or conducting open-market operations, such as buying or selling U.S. Treasury bonds. It's a straightforward task guided by copious amounts of economic data.",

    "description": "Centerview Partners has reached a settlement with a former analyst just before a trial was set to begin over its grueling 100-hour workweeks.",
    "fullText": "Centerview Partners and former junior banker Kathryn Shiber have reached a settlement, ending a closely watched lawsuit about Wall Street work culture that was set to go to trial in Manhattan federal court on Monday.\n\nThe case centered on allegations that the boutique investment bank violated disability discrimination laws when it fired Shiber in 2020 after she said she needed eight to nine hours of sleep each night because of an underlying mood and anxiety disorder.\n\nCourt filings and depositions in the case offered a rare look into the grueling demands placed on first-year analysts, including testimony that they typically work between 60 and 120 hours a week and that \"in some projects, you are working 24 hours a day.\" Emails between Shiber and her higher-ups highlighted the unpredictable nature of the job, with her associate saying in one exchange that \"there will always be more for you to do.\"\n\nCenterview has denied wrongdoing.\n\n\"Centerview has said all along that Ms. Shiber's legal claims have no merit,\" a Centerview spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement. \"We were ready to prove that in court, and are confident we would have prevailed at trial. But we are nonetheless happy to put this distraction behind us and focus on delivering for our clients.\"\n\nThe resolution means a jury will not weigh in on questions about Wall Street's long hours and workplace accommodations, and that top bankers won't have to take the witness stand. Tony Kim, the co-president of the investment bank, was among those expected to testify.\n\nJunior bankers, more formally known as investment banking analysts, tend to be recent graduates starting at the bottom rung of Wall Street's high-stakes dealmaking operations. They are often charged with grunt work, such as reformatting pitch decks or gathering data for a more senior coworker.\n\nShiber joined Centerview in July 2020 and was assigned to an active deal nicknamed \"Project Dragon.\" After working till about 2 am for several days in a row, she logged oﬀ at around 1 am on a Friday without first communicating her plans to the team leads, court filings said. After she reached out to human resources, the bank granted her a work accommodation from midnight to 9 am, but dismissed her weeks later.\n\nTerms of the settlement were not disclosed. Lawyers for Shiber did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "It's a rare day when John Hussman, the legendary permabear who called the 2000 and 2008 crashes, expresses a degree of optimism about stocks.",
    "fullText": "It's a rare day when John Hussman, the legendary permabear who called the 2000 and 2008 crashes, expresses a degree of optimism about stocks.\n\nOne of those days came this week, however, when Hussman published his monthly market comment.\n\nThe president of the Hussman Investment Trust has been consistently bearish throughout the 2010s and 2020s, warning of potential drawdowns of 60% or more. While there have been rough patches for stocks during recent years — like the 35% S&P 500 COVID drawdown and the 25% decline amid the 2022 inflation surge — the market has repeatedly bounced back, posting huge cumulative gains.\n\nNow, the impressive returns appear to have Hussman readjusting his calculus — and his mindset.\n\nHussman said he expanded his investment parameters by reducing his downside hedges to allow for more upside potential, even during what he deems bubble periods, like today.\n\n\"I recently came to the realization that I've been discriminating against the bubble,\" Hussman wrote in his commentary titled \"How I Learned To Love the Bubble (Even Before it Bursts).\"\n\n\"Yes, we know that speculative bubbles can be filled with delusion, and their eventual collapse can cause a great deal of suffering, so when we see conditions that have inevitably led to that sort of outcome, it's natural to hope for — and look forward to — better investment conditions elsewhere, in the future,\" he wrote. \"But I decided we might be able to do better by finding and cultivating roses here and now, even amid what we are convinced is garbage.\"\n\nHussman has often warned over the last few years of \"trap door\" conditions, where extremely high valuations accompanied by deteriorating investor sentiment made it likely to see sharp downside in the near-term.\n\nHussman's preferred valuation model — the ratio of the total market cap of non-financial stock to the revenue of those stocks — is near all-time highs, beating peaks reached in 2021, 2000, and 1929.\n\nBut, increasingly, the market's best days have come during these periods, he said. Going back to the 1940s, the market's high-return days have come just 2% of the time amid poor conditions. Now, with valuations consistently high since 2020, they've come more frequently, and it's crucial to have exposure to them.\n\n\"Because 'trap door' conditions have been more frequent in recent years, these 'roses' appear in close to 15% of weekly periods during most recent 1-, 3-, and 5-year horizons,\" he wrote. \"Yet they easily account for more than half of the S&P 500 total return over these horizons.\"\n\nWhile Hussman may be a bit less bearish than he was before, he said not to anticipate a full-blown shift to the bullish side of the aisle.\n\n\"For anyone waiting for me to turn bullish as their signal to sell at the bubble highs,\" he wrote, \"I'll gently suggest that the title of this comment may be as much as you can ever hope to get.\"",

    "fullText": "Gold's historic rally sidelined one of its biggest buyers — but they're eyeing a comeback, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe precious metal has been on a red-hot run over the past year, hitting a record high above $5,500 per ounce late last month before a sharp correction.\n\nWhile gold's rise has been buoyed by central bank buying in recent years, sharp price swings have temporarily slowed that demand.\n\n\"Our conversations suggest that reserve managers remain willing buyers of gold to hedge geopolitical and financial risks but prefer to delay purchases until prices stabilize,\" Goldman commodity analysts Lina Thomas and Daan Struyven wrote in a note on Thursday.\n\nThe elevated volatility was driven by private-sector diversification demand — much of it expressed through gold call-option structures that amplify price moves.\n\nThat volatility has made some emerging-market central banks more hesitant to step in aggressively at current levels, even as they remain structurally bullish.\n\nCentral banks bought roughly 1,000 metric tons of gold on a net basis in 2023 and 2024, according to the World Gold Council. That dipped to around 900 tons in 2025, but they bought at higher prices compared to the past two years.\n\nSpot gold was trading around $4,995 per troy ounce in early Friday trade. Prices are up about 16% so far this year.\n\nThe structural backdrop, Goldman's analysts argued, hasn't changed. Since the freezing of Russia's reserves over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, central banks have reassessed the risks of holding dollar assets and started buying gold as an alternative.\n\nIn its base case — which assumes no additional surge in private-sector diversification — Goldman expects volatility to moderate and central-bank buying to reaccelerate, broadly in line with the pace seen in 2025.\n\nTogether with incremental private-investor demand tied to potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, that could push gold to $5,400 an ounce by the end of 2026, the bank said.\n\nHowever, if diversification demand accelerates further — particularly on concerns about fiscal risks in Western economies — volatility could remain elevated. That's especially true if the flows continue to be expressed through options.\n\nIn that case, near-term central-bank demand may be dampened even as prices rise more sharply.\n\nDavid Miller, the chief investment officer of $10 billion Catalyst Funds, echoed the longer-term case for official-sector demand earlier this month.\n\n\"From a mining perspective, there has been some selling by individuals cashing in their gold holdings at higher prices, but nothing on a scale that could offset the 1,000 metric tons of net buying by central banks,\" Miller wrote in a note last week.\n\nMiller, who manages a gold ETF, added that central banks are likely to continue buying gold, keeping demand ahead of supply, as mining output can't be ramped up quickly.\n\n\"It appears we're transitioning back into a longer-term rally, though one that is likely to be much choppier,\" he added.",

    "description": "Kathryn Shiber is suing Centerview over claims of disability discrimination. Court docs suggest Wall Street culture itself will also be on the stand.",
    "fullText": "A lawsuit offering a rare look at the daily grind of junior investment bankers is scheduled to begin next week, and court documents suggest that potential jurors will be asked to reckon with their relationship to Wall Street culture.\n\nThe case hinges on Kathryn Shiber, who alleges that boutique investment bank Centerview Partners violated disability discrimination laws when it fired her because she couldn't consistently work into the early morning hours. Shiber joined the firm as a junior banker in July 2020, after graduating from Dartmouth College. After a few consecutive days working past midnight, she said told human resources that she had to get between eight and nine hours of sleep each night because of an underlying mood and anxiety disorder, and got approval for some accommodations. In September, the New York-based firm fired her because she could not perform the essential job functions, according to her suit.\n\nThe proposed voir dire questions — the screening questions lawyers use to assess whether potential jurors can be impartial— hint that Wall Street's notoriously grueling culture will be on display once the trial kicks off.\n\n\"Do you feel it is fair for an employer to expect that employees work long or unpredictable hours if employees are compensated for those hours?\" Centerview proposes asking in its voir dire document.\n\nCenterview has also proposed asking potential jurors whether they have \"any opinions or beliefs about Wall Street, the finance industry, or investment banking\" that would impact their impartiality. Shiber's lawyers take it a step further, proposing that they ask specifically whether jurors have \"strong opinions\" about investment banking or \"people who work\" in the industry.\n\nDepositions filed in the case indicate that junior bankers, formally known as first-year analysts, should expect to work between 60 and 120 hours per week. Hours are unpredictable and can stretch into the early morning, Tony Kim, then a partner and now the co-president of investment banking at Centerview, said in his deposition. 24-hour days are possible, but rare, he said, adding that juniors staffed on an active deal are expected to check in before going to sleep.\n\n\"Junior bankers obviously don't need permission to go to sleep, but are expected to work together and communicate properly with teammates,\" Centerview told Business Insider in a statement. Shiber's lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBoth sides have also proposed quizzing jurors on mental health and discrimination. Centerview's attorneys, for example, have proposed asking potential jurors whether they have ever requested accommodations at a job for a disability or filed a grievance for employment-related reasons.\n\n\"Do you think today's employment laws make it too easy for an employee to sue an employer for discrimination?\" Shiber's lawyers proposed asking.\n\nJunior bankers' mental health came under intense scrutiny in 2024, after Leo Lukenas III, an investment banking associate at Bank of America, died. Some firms implemented policies they said would help track and limit hours. But 2026 is expected to see an M&A boom, potentially pushing junior bankers to log even more hours as deal activity picks up.\n\nJurors could also be asked about Centerview bankers who might come up at trial. The voir dire questionnaire from Shiber's lawyers shows they have considered asking about Robert Pruzan, the firm's cofounder and a well-known M&A banker.\n\nWall Street, known for its high pay, has at times become a cultural flashpoint — most notably during the 2011 Occupy Wall Street protests over the financial crisis. More recently, President Donald Trump has introduced a policy that he has said will lower costs for everyday Americans by capping the interest banks can charge on credit cards to 10% for a year.\n\nAll the while, finance titans are earning record pay, and Americans' relationship to capitalism itself is changing — meaning that answering voir dire questions about the people who dot the halls of prestigious firms may not be a simple task.",

    "fullText": "One of Wall Street's biggest crypto skeptics is taking fresh aim at bitcoin amid its steep sell-off.\n\nNouriel Roubini — also known as \"Dr. Doom\" for his frequently apocalyptic predictions on markets and the economy — doubled down on his view that bitcoin is far from being an inflation hedge and is a \"pseudo-asset class.\"\n\nBitcoin, which entered bear market territory late last year, traded around $67,400 on Wednesday, down 45% from its peak in late October.\n\n\"Calling Bitcoin or any other crypto vehicle a 'currency' has always been bogus. It is neither a unit of account, a scalable means of payment, nor a stable store of value,\" Roubini wrote in an op-ed for Project Syndicate earlier this month.\n\nRoubini, who has blasted bitcoin in the past as a \"Ponzi Game\" associated with criminal activity and said he believed the token was in \"the mother of all bubbles,\" pointed to the crypto's potential use in illegal transactions. He also said that crypto broadly poses a risk to the financial system as lawmakers integrate it further into traditional banking.\n\nIn particular, he highlighted the GENIUS Act, and said the landmark stablecoin bill should be remembered as the \"Reckless Idiot Act,\" partly because the bill specifies that stablecoins do not have lender-of-last resort or deposit insurance benefits.\n\nThe push among some players in the crypto industry to allow interest payments on stablecoins could further \"undermine the foundations of the banking system,\" he added.\n\n\"Thus, all it would take to incite a panic and trigger a bank run is for a few bad apples in pseudo-libertarian US states to mis-invest their holdings or place their deposits in weak institutions,\" Roubini speculated. \"This is a political and financial stability issue, and few are as serious or as sensitive,\" he later added.\n\nBitcoin's pronounced sell-off has slashed the token's value nearly in half. Should its decline lead to a true bitcoin winter, some forecasters see the coin dropping to as low as $31,000, a more than 50% drop from the token's current levels.",

    "description": "Wall Street's preeminent valuation yardstick offers a worrisome tale for investors.",
    "fullText": "From an investment standpoint, Wall Street is a fan of Donald Trump in the White House. During President Trump's first term in office, the mature stock-driven Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), benchmark S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and innovation-fueled Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) gained 57%, 70%, and 142%, respectively.\n\nIn the year and change since he was inaugurated for his second, non-consecutive term, an encore Trump bull market rally has taken shape. From Jan. 20, 2025, through the closing bell on Feb. 10, 2026, the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have, respectively, rallied 15%, 16%, and 18%. Outsize returns have become something of the norm.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nWhile several catalysts are behind this exceptionally strong bull market, some of which can be attributed to Donald Trump, there are also headwinds that can derail this rally. One insurmountable obstacle that has over 150 years of history in its sails is of particular concern.\n\nTo get a bit of housekeeping out of the way, Wall Street's major indexes climbing is nothing new. Since March 1897, there have been 33 presidential terms, 26 of which resulted in a positive return in either the Dow Jones Industrial Average or S&P 500. Most presidents oversee a growing U.S. economy and investment optimism, leading to stock market gains during their tenure -- and Trump has been no exception.\n\nHowever, the early annualized return for President Trump's second term is among the best of any president dating back well over a century. As investors, it pays to understand what's behind this outsize return.\n\nNot all of the stock market's upside catalysts have been influenced by the president. For instance, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), which began during Joe Biden's presidency, and the advent of quantum computing are playing key roles in lifting the broader market. Analysts at PwC believe AI can add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, while Boston Consulting Group estimates quantum computing will create up to $850 billion in global economic value by 2040. These technologies are clearly exciting investors.\n\nLikewise, President Trump had no hand in the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates on six occasions since September 2024. Lowering lending rates can encourage corporate borrowing, in turn leading to an increase in hiring, acquisition activity, and capital devoted to innovation.",

Anthropic’s terms of use prohibit the use of Claude for violent ends, for the development of weapons or for conducting surveillance.\n\nAnthropic was the first AI developer known to be used in a classified operation by the US department of defence. It was unclear how the tool, which has capabilities ranging from processing PDFs to piloting autonomous drones, was deployed.\n\nA spokesperson for Anthropic declined to comment on whether Claude was used in the operation, but said any use of the AI tool was required to comply with its usage policies. The US defence department did not comment on the claims.\n\nThe WSJ cited anonymous sources who said Claude was used through Anthropic’s partnership with Palantir Technologies, a contractor with the US defence department and federal law enforcement agencies. Palantir refused to comment on the claims.\n\nThe US and other militaries increasingly deploy AI as part of their arsenals. Israel’s military has used drones with autonomous capabilities in Gaza and has extensively used AI to fill its targeting bank in Gaza. The US military has used AI targeting for strikes in Iraq and Syria in recent years.\n\nCritics have warned against the use of AI in weapons technologies and the deployment of autonomous weapons systems, pointing to targeting mistakes created by computers governing who should and should not be killed.\n\nAI companies have grappled with how their technologies should engage with the defence sector, with Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, calling for regulation to prevent harms from the deployment of AI. Amodei has also expressed wariness over the use of AI in autonomous lethal operations and surveillance in the US.\n\nThis more cautious stance has apparently rankled the US defence department, with the secretary of war, Pete Hegseth, saying in January that the department wouldn’t “employ AI models that won’t allow you to fight wars”.\n\nThe Pentagon announced in January that it would work with xAI, owned by Elon Musk. The defence department also uses a custom version of Google’s Gemini and OpenAI systems to support research.",

    "fullText": "A custom suit is the signature look on Wall Street, and it's New York's tailors who keep the city's bankers, stockbrokers, and lawyers looking sharp.\n\nSome of these businesses have been city fixtures for decades, while others are newer arrivals that have quickly built reputations in the finance world.\n\nHere's a look behind the scenes at three of the tailor shops that serve Wall Street, and who owns them.\n\nSince the mid-1980s, Alan Flusser's shop near East 48th Street and Fifth Avenue has been a fixture for Wall Street clients. Flusser designed the wardrobes of the iconic movies \"Wall Street\" and \"American Psycho.\"\n\nWhen Flusser retired in 2020, Sigmon, who had previously worked for Suitsupply, took the reins.\n\nHe described the house style to Business Insider as relaxed and \"guided by proper proportions meant to flatter the individual\" rather than trends.\n\nLS Mens Clothing on West 45th Street and Sixth Avenue is a family business that first opened in 1954.\n\n\"I've been doing this for 42 years,\" Zuber told Business Insider.\n\nIn his decades-long career, he's observed some notable shifts in styles.\n\n\"People are dressing thinner,\" he said. \"They're dressing thinner in the arms — even the conservative people, the business people.\"\n\nBefore opening Michael Andrews Bespoke, Andrews trained as an engineer and later worked as a corporate attorney. Required to wear a suit daily, he said he struggled to find off-the-rack options that met his standards.\n\nHe started having custom suits made, and went on to study tailoring.\n\nHe launched the business in 2006, and the flagship is store on Great Jones Alley in NoHo, between Broadway and Lafayette. The newer store is on West 20th Street, between Sixth and Seventh avenues.\n\nIt also has locations in Washington. D.C., Miami, and soon London.\n\n\"The vast majority of our clients are either investment bankers, finance guys, private equity, your typical New York finance guy, or lawyers who, to a large degree, service the financial industry,\" Andrews told Business Insider.\n\nIn 2024, Michael Andrews Bespoke employed three new full-time and two part-time tailors.\n\nRising demand for alterations led the business to hire a further two staff members in NYC the following year, bringing the total to four full-time and three part-time tailors in 2025.\n\n\"We've had dozens of clients bring back entire wardrobes,\" Andrews told Business Insider. \"For a couple of clients, it's 20 to 40 pieces that we've had to take in because they've lost 20 to 30 pounds.\"\n\nSigmon and Zuber also told Business Insider that demand for alterations, mostly take-ins, is growing as Wall Street clients' waistlines shrink.\n\nAs Andrews put it, \"the Ozempic effect is real.\"\n\nRead more about how GLP-1s are reshaping Wall Street.",

Two of those three periods have occurred since 2019 (2019-2021 and 2023-2025).\n\nWhile game-changing technological trends, such as the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), have played a role in catapulting the broader market to new heights, it's Wall Street's trillion-dollar companies that have done a lot of the heavy lifting. Including Walmart, which became the newest member of the trillion-dollar club last week, 12 companies listed on U.S. exchanges have reached the elusive $1 trillion market cap.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nAlthough it's unlikely that trillion-dollar stocks will deliver truly jaw-dropping investment returns going forward, these companies are, nonetheless, industry leaders that are fully capable of heading even higher -- and Wall Street analysts know it.\n\nWhile analysts are collectively bullish on all 12 trillion-dollar stocks listed in the U.S., there's outsize optimism for three of these companies. Based on the price targets of select Wall Street analysts, the following members of the trillion-dollar club can soar up to 90% in 2026.\n\nThe first trillion-dollar stock that's projected to skyrocket this year is the face of the AI revolution, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). As of February 2026, 63 Wall Street analysts have weighed in on Nvidia, with 59 rating it the equivalent of a strong buy or buy. One of these 59 analysts is Mark Lipacis of Evercore ISI, the institutional equities division of Evercore. Lipacis sees Nvidia's shares rising to $352, representing 90% upside from its Feb. 6 closing price.\n\nPretty much every analyst and everyday investor recognizes the data center dominance that Nvidia brings to the table. Its Hopper (H100), Blackwell, and Blackwell Ultra graphics processing units (GPUs) hold a near monopoly in AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nLipacis' outsize optimism is based on the belief that Nvidia will be the undisputed beneficiary of AI-driven parallel processing. In other words, customers will be able to leverage the compute superiority of Nvidia's GPUs and its CUDA software platform to run simultaneous tasks. With CEO Jensen Huang overseeing the rollout of an advanced GPU annually, it's unlikely that any external competitors will match or surpass the compute capabilities of Nvidia's AI hardware anytime soon.",

    "description": "Wall Street is gearing up for an update on the Fed's favored inflation gauge after the jobs report bolstered the case against cutting rates.",
    "fullText": "US stocks turned sharply lower Thursday, as investors revived a rotation out of megacap tech stocks as they looked ahead Friday's inflation reading to guide rate-cut bets, already dampened by a strong January jobs report.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell roughly 1%, or over 500 points, after the blue-chip benchmark snapped a three-day win streak on Wednesday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 1.2%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell nearly 2%.\n\nThe mixed picture comes as investors scrutinize incoming earnings closely for clues to the sectors vulnerable to AI disruption, which spurred the recent meltdown in software stocks. Cisco Systems (CSCO) stock fell over 11% as its gloomy profit outlook overshadowed a rise in sales amid Big Tech's AI buildout.\n\nBig Tech stocks followed suit. Nvidia and Microsoft both fell over 1%, while Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) saw steeper losses.\n\nMeanwhile, attention is starting to turn to Friday’s Consumer Price Index report. A softer reading will build hopes that price pressures are easing while economic growth remains intact.\n\nBefore then, the weekly reading on jobless claims — which showed a smaller decline than expected — came in focus after nonfarm-payrolls data showed the US economy added twice as many jobs as anticipated in January. The strength in hiring complicates expectations for Fed policy. A resilient labor market, paired with sticky inflation, is seen as reducing the likelihood of near-term interest-rate cuts — a key driver of recent equity gains.\n\nElsewhere on the earnings front, McDonald’s (MCD) shares nudged higher after the burger giant's earnings beat. Looking ahead, Coinbase (COIN), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Rivian (RIVN) are highlights on Thursday's docket, all due after the market close.\n\nApple (AAPL) stock was the worst-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" stock on Thursday afternoon, dropping around 5% as part of a broad sell-off across tech.\n\nReports on Wednesday that Apple's highly anticipated upgrade to its Siri voice assistant could be delayed also weighed on shares, which are off by 4% year to date. The new Siri was intended to be launched as part of an operating system update in March, but certain features could be postponed due to issues in testing, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.\n\nThe rollout of the revamped Siri, first announced in June 2024, has been riddled with delays, putting investors on edge about Apple's artificial intelligence capabilities.\n\nSeparately, US Federal Trade Commission Chairman Andrew Ferguson said Wednesday he sent a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook, raising concerns about allegations that Apple News has been censoring content from conservative publications.\n\nMeta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Tesla (TSLA) were also down more than 2% as tech got hit. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) was the lone Magnificent Seven name in the green, up 0.4%.\n\nInflation in electricity prices has more than doubled headline PCE inflation as the AI infrastructure and data center build-out have sent power demand soaring through the US, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a client note on Wednesday.\n\nElectricity prices rose by 6.9% year over year through December 2025, the bank wrote, while PCE inflation rose 2.9% over the same period. On an annualized average basis, electricity prices rose by 6.8% since January 2022, while headline PCE inflation rose by 3.4%.\n\nThe rapid inflation in electricity prices is primarily driven by two key factors: the rapid construction of data centers, which demand enormous amounts of energy to operate, and the boom in capital investment by utility companies as they attempt to increase energy supply to meet demand, \"which will raise utility costs and therefore electricity prices.\"\n\nThe analysts also noted several bottlenecks that will prevent energy supply from catching up with demand, including strict regulations and shortages of critical hardware such as transformers and natural gas turbines.\n\n\"The combination of strong demand and sluggish supply will likely increase power prices in regional wholesale markets — where most utilities and other market participants procure electricity before delivering it to final customers,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nThough they note that the pressure will likely be \"much more acute in a few markets than the US as a whole because data centers are highly geographically concentrated,\" with \"about 1% of all US counties account[ing] for about 70% of data center capacity.\"\n\nThe largest jumps in electricity inflation are likely to be seen in \"tighter power markets\" in the Midwest, California, and Texas, the analysts wrote.\n\nThe US stock market turned into the red through late morning trading on Thursday, marking a sharp reversal from earlier gains on the major indexes.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way down, shedding roughly 1.5%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which snapped a three-day streak of gains on Wednesday, both lost roughly 1%.\n\nThe downturn comes as investors look for any signs of weakness in the earnings reports of companies vulnerable to AI disruption, which has triggered the meltdown in software stocks over the past week-and-a-half. Cisco Systems (CSCO) stock fell over 11% as its gloomy profit outlook overshadowed a rise in sales amid Big Tech's AI buildout.\n\nThe tech sector's largest names also dragged the sector down, as Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) both fell over 1% while Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) saw steeper losses.\n\nWhile investors got a bullish read on the labor market in Wednesday's nonfarm payrolls report, showing that January added twice as many jobs as expected, data published Thursday on initial jobless claims dimmed some of that optimism, showing a smaller decline than expected.\n\nOil prices fell on Thursday as investors weighed a new demand forecast from the International Energy Agency, which predicted a slowdown, and unclear progress in talks between the US and Iran.\n\nFutures on international pricing benchmark Brent crude (BZ=F) and US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CL=F) shed roughly 1.8% to trade below $68.20 and $63.50 a barrel, respectively.\n\nIn a new publication on Thursday, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said world oil demand would rise by 850,000 barrels per day (bpd) this year, 80,000 bpd lower than the agency's January forecast. The figure is also much lower than that published by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on Wednesday, which said demand would rise by 1.38 million bpd this year.\n\nThe IEA also maintained its call that the market will spend 2026 in a deep oversupply glut, which the agency pegged at 3.73 million bpd of excess oil.\n\nWhile market watchers had broadly coalesced around the likelihood of a supply glut through 2026, with prices expected to drop, oil prices have instead gained roughly 10% since the start of the year, following a series of geopolitical events, including the US takeover of Venezuela's oil industry, widespread protests in Iran, and damage to key export terminals on the Caspian Sea.\n\nIn public comments on Thursday, the CEO of commodities trading house Vitol, Russell Hardy, said the global oil market is tightening instead of loosening, especially as the US ratchets up pressure on Russia and Iran, pushing buyers to find barrels in other markets.\n\nVitol is the world's largest independent trader of oil.\n\nThe key swing factor for oil prices right now remains ongoing negotiations between the US and Iran over the Iranian regime's uranium enrichment technology. President Trump on Wednesday deployed more military craft to the region, and analysts say any military action could result in retaliation from Iran, which controls the Strait of Hormuz, a critically important global chokepoint for oil flows.\n\nAs worries around the electricity and water demand of AI data centers have taken root, federal and state lawmakers have begun pushing back, introducing bills to regulate or halt development entirely.\n\nThis week, Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) introduced the first bipartisan bill in Congress designed to prevent data center power usage from affecting consumers' electric bills.\n\nA week earlier, on Feb. 6, New York became at least the sixth state to have its legislators propose a bill to pause data center construction within state lines. This legislation would effectively shut out New York as a potential site for new data centers if it passes.\n\nIn doing so, New York's legislators join federal and state congressional leaders across the country in attempting to legislate an industry that has boomed and threatens an already overtaxed power grid.\n\n\"The regulatory framework was not designed for single-sector load shocks, so policymakers are attempting to adjust in real time to the scale and speed at which the load forecasts are changing,\" Didi Caldwell, founder and CEO of site selection advisory firm Global Location Strategies, told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"The system is ill-equipped to address the dramatic increase in demand created by AI data centers,\" she said.\n\nAnd lawmakers are trying to catch up.\n\nWednesday's unexpectedly bullish jobs report has all but shuttered the odds of rate cuts under current Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and narrowed the path to cuts under a Kevin Warsh-led Fed, Bank of America economists wrote in a client note on Thursday, calling the report \"a feast for the hawks.\"\n\nData released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday showed that the US added 130,000 jobs in January, doubling economists' expectations of 65,000. The unemployment rate also fell to 4.3% from 4.4%, beating expectations that the rate would remain flat.\n\nThe data gave lift to the argument that even as inflation has stayed elevated, the labor market is remaining resilient. These conditions are seen as reducing the odds of rate cuts in the near future.\n\n\"Payrolls surged above all expectations, the downward revisions were minimal, and wages and hours were up as well,\" the analysts wrote. \"The broad-based strength in the Jan jobs report vindicates our view that the Fed won't cut under Powell.\"\n\nFor now, the economists wrote, BofA is maintaining its prediction of two rate cuts under a Warsh-led Fed. But the swing metric for potential rate cuts under Warsh, they wrote, will be the unemployment rate.\n\n\"The key risk to his call for significant cuts is a decline in the u-rate. Therefore, the path to cuts under Warsh (which we don't think the economy needs) now looks narrower,\" the BofA economists wrote.\n\n\"If the u-rate is stable or down even further by June, Warsh might be stuck on hold for the rest of the year.\"\n\nUS stocks rose in the first minutes of trading on Thursday as investors digested the latest string of earnings reports and looked ahead to Friday's inflation reading as the next major signpost for rate-cut bets.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) picked up roughly 0.5% as trading began, after the blue-chip benchmark snapped a three-day win streak on Wednesday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) both rose around 0.3%.\n\nThursday's weekly reading on jobless claims — which showed a smaller decline than expected — offered another picture of the labor market after nonfarm-payrolls data showed the US economy added twice as many jobs as anticipated in January.\n\nOn the corporate calendar, earnings from Coinbase (COIN), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Rivian (RIVN) are due after Thursday's closing bell.\n\nThe US saw 227,000 initial jobless claims for the week ended Feb. 7, exceeding expectations and marking a decrease from the previous week's 232,000 initial claims, according to data released Thursday by the Department of Labor.\n\nEconomists had expected 223,000 claims for unemployment benefits, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nContinuing claims for the week came in at 1.86 million, also exceeding economists' estimates of 1.85 million and marking an increase over the previous week's 1.84 million continuing claims.\n\nThe Labor Department data comes after investors received a stronger-than-expected read on payroll additions in January.\n\nData released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed 130,000 jobs added in January, compared to estimates of 65,000 jobs. However, 2025 revisions knocked 400,000 job additions off the year's total, bringing the monthly average of payroll additions to roughly 15,000 per month.\n\nEuropean stocks broadly gained on Thursday as earnings results from Siemens, EssilorLuxxotica, and others lifted sentiment.\n\nGermany's DAX (^GDAXI) rose 1.3%. The index was lifted by a 6% increase in Siemens stock (SIE.DE) after the industrial company raised its 2026 earnings guidance due to strong artificial intelligence demand.\n\nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) advanced another 0.3% after hitting a record high on Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris climbed 1%. Shares of component EssilorLuxxotica (EL.PA), the maker of Ray-Ban and Oakley sunglasses, jumped more than 6% after the company sounded bullish on revenue growth from smart glasses in its earnings report. EssilorLuxxotica expanded its partnership with Meta (META) to produce the AI glasses.\n\nUS healthcare company Baxter's (BAX) stock sank 14% before the bell on Thursday following the release of its fourth quarter earnings, forecasting annual profit below Wall Street estimates. The company cited persistent problems from hurricane-related issues at one of its manufacturing plants.\n\nMagnum Ice Cream's (MICC) stock fell 12% during premarket hours on Thursday. The group, which was recently spun off from Unilever (UL) and makes popular ice creams such as Ben & Jerry's and Cornetto, reported a 3% decline in sales for its fourth quarter earnings.\n\nSanofi (SNY) stock fell 6% before the bell on Thursday after the French pharmaceutical company ousted its CEO, Paul Hudson, thanking him Thursday for \"valuable contributions\" but without giving any reason for his surprise exit.\n\nMicron (MU) stock rose 3% during premarket hours on Thursday after its CEO, brushed off concerns on Wednesday about competition growing in the memory chip space. Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) also claimed an early lead in the race to supply AI chips to Nvidia (NVDA). Samsung Electronics is a key competitor of Micron.\n\nAppLovin (APP) shares fell 5% before the bell today following the group's fourth-quarter earnings release on Wednesday, which beat Wall Street estimates. The advertising company's shares have fallen almost 30% over the past month.\n\nSome smaller pharmaceutical companies not targeted by President Trump for deals to lower their US drug pricing are looking to craft their own agreements with his administration, industry sources told Reuters. The moves are a bid to avoid potentially onerous tariffs and new price-setting schemes.\n\nCisco (CSCO) stock fell 7% during premarket hours on Thursday after the networking company issued guidance below Wall Street forecasts.\n\nFor the full year, Cisco raised its guidance for earnings per share to $3.00 to $3.08 on revenue of $61.2 billion to $61.7 billion. However, the Street was looking for earnings guidance of $3.12 on revenue of $62.1 billion.\n\nIn Cisco's second quarter, the company reported earnings per share of $0.80, compared to Wall Street analyst estimates of $0.74 per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue rose 10% year over year to $15.3 billion, compared to estimates of $15.1 billion.\n\n\"We see strong, broad-based demand for our technology solutions and remain focused on capturing the significant opportunities we see ahead,\" Cisco CFO Mark Patterson said.",

    "fullText": "But, after second day of Wall Street falls, analysts say sell-off ‘may overstate AI’s immediate risk to complex deal-making’\n\nShares in commercial property services companies have tumbled, in the latest sell-off driven by fears over disruption from artificial intelligence.\n\nAfter steep declines on Wall Street, European stocks in the sector were hit on Thursday.\n\nThe estate agent Savills’ shares fell 7.5% in London, while the serviced office provider International Workplace Group, which owns the Regus brand, lost 9%.\n\nThe UK’s two biggest property developers, British Land and Landsec, dropped 2.6% and 2.4% respectively.\n\nOn Wall Street, property service firms fell for a second consecutive day. CBRE shares plunged 12.5%, Jones Lang LaSalle lost nearly 11% and Cushman & Wakefield fell 9.1%, after even sharper declines on Wednesday.\n\nCommercial property stocks have become the latest sector to be hammered by fears over the impact of rapid advances in AI, as the sell-off spread from legal software, publishing, analytics and data companies last week to insurance firms, price comparison sites and wealth managers this week.\n\nThe share declines were sparked by AI firms such as Anthropic, the company behind the chatbot Claude, releasing new tools, although there was limited news on Thursday, leading analysts to argue that the sell-off was overdone.\n\nAI has the potential to automate a wide range of office-based tasks and could lead to swathes of job losses. There are also concerns among investors that demand for offices could fall, in a blow to property companies.\n\nJade Rahmani, commercial real estate analyst at New York-headquartered Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said: “We believe investors are rotating out of high-fee, labour-intensive business models viewed as potentially vulnerable to AI-driven disruption.”\n\nHowever, he believes that the sell-off “may overstate the immediate risk to complex deal-making, even as the long-term AI impact remains a ‘wait-and-see’”.\n\nDallas-based CBRE on Thursday reported fourth-quarter revenue of $11.6bn (£8.5bn), up 12%, and core earnings per share of $2.73, above analysts’ estimates. In 2025, revenues rose by 13% to $40.6bn.\n\nThe real estate services firm forecast 2026 profit above Wall Street estimates, on the back of strong momentum in leasing and facilities management, as the number of datacentres rapidly expands and billions of dollars flow into AI infrastructure.\n\nCBRE’s chief executive, Bob Sulentic, believes AI will benefit the business in the long run, with its transaction and investment work “most protected” from disruption.\n\n“Clients engage CBRE to plan and execute complex transactions because of our creativity, strategic thinking, negotiating skills, deep base of market knowledge and broad relationships,” he said. “None of this seems likely to be replaced by AI in the foreseeable future.”",

    "description": "China told its banks to reduce holdings of US government debt this week, with market pros split on how the move could impact the US and Treasury markets.",
    "fullText": "China instructed banks to dial back their holdings of US Treasury debt this week, a move that sparked fresh conversations about \"Sell America.\"\n\nChinese regulators said the move was related to volatility and concentration risks in US debt, and it wasn't framed specifically as a critique of the dollar-led financial system. Yet, market commentators see it, in part, as an update to a broader geopolitical narrative that's gripped markets in the last year.\n\nBloomberg reported that China's banks collectively hold $298 billion in US dollar-denominated bonds, though is not known much of that is made up of US Treasurys versus things like US corporate debt.\n\nThe impact on treasury yields has been minimal so far, but economists and market pros say the move raises concerns about future knock-on effects.\n\nA senior fellow at the economic policy think tank, Lachman has previously raised concerns about the position of the US as a global economic superpower.\n\nHe said this week that he is deeply concerned about what China's decision may mean for the US, particularly as other nations have already begun shifting away from dollar-denominated assets.\n\n\"[The US] desperately needs foreigners to keep buying US Treasuries to provide that financing, and the last thing that it needs is for foreigners to start selling their Treasurys,\" he told Business Insider, adding that foreign investors hold about 30% of the outstanding amount of US Treasurys.\n\n\"The drying up of foreign buying of our government's bonds could set us up for a bond market and dollar crisis.\"\n\nSetster isn't as concerned about the market implications of China's move. He sees the decision as a reflection of China's need to make changes in order to help stabilize its own economy and guard against volatility from the US after struggling in recent years.\n\n\"Global investors should consequently be paying much more attention to the flows tied to China's currency management,\" he advised. \"Despite the recent warning, my strong suspicion is that Chinese state institutions will struggle to find good alternatives to the Treasury market if they are buying $50 billion or \n\nKedia, an economist at the libertarian think tank, shares Setser's perspective that investors shouldn't regard China's decision as a geopolitical development. He told Business Insider that while he expects China to continue selling off its US Treasurys, it likely won't yield a sizable negative impact for the US.\n\n\"People have a way overestimated opinion of how much value of US government debt China actually holds,\" he stated. \"The value isn't anywhere near enough to crash our markets or anything like that.\"\n\nKedia acknowledged that a massive offloading of government bonds would likely impact the market, but he added that he doesn't see that as likely\n\nRen, who serves as director of modern alpha at asset manager WisdomTree, sees it as more explicitly geopolitical than other commentators.\n\n\"The move is largely geopolitical, with financial factors secondary,\" she said. \"China uses US treasury holdings for part of its currency management, making rapid liquidation unlikely. While near-term risks remain low, preparations for potential regional conflict involving Japan or the Taiwan Strait are reinforcing incentives on both sides to reduce financial dependence.\"\n\nIn her view, China isn't likely to be a net buyer of US government debt until the two nations reach an equilibrium.\n\nThe market research firm's chief China strategist thinks the regulatory guidance is mostly about risk management. That said, he thinks geopolitical tensions are a factor in China's decision as well.\n\n\"China has been reducing its holdings of US assets—particularly Treasurys—in recent years, and the pace has accelerated sharply since Russia's invasion of Ukraine,\" he said. \"Beijing's core strategic objective is to reduce its vulnerability to potential US sanctions under conditions of severe geopolitical stress.\"\n\nLike Kedia, Wang expects China to continue selling its holdings of US government debt. He claims that US Treasurys account for roughly 20% of China's reserves, likely above the comfort level of its government.",

    "fullText": "Over the last half-decade, perhaps no one has personified the archetype of a finance bro more than Mark Moran.\n\nHis cuff-links pop out of tailored suits. He posts on X about his preferred loafers. In 2024, he told Business Insider about his love for Zyn.\n\nNow, he's leaving it all behind — or, rather, he's bringing it all to the world of politics.\n\nMoran is launching a bid for Senate in Virginia, running as a Democrat against incumbent Mark Warner. He'll try to build off the online popularity he's generated in recent years as a Wall Street culture personality.\n\nAfter stints at investment banking like Lazard and Centerview Partners, Moran first gained notoriety after being selected as a contestant on HBO's Fboy Island reality dating show in 2021. He then became the first employee of the popular financial meme account Litquidity before launching his own investor relations firm, Equity Animal, in 2022.\n\nDespite being a prominent face for millennials in finance, the 33-year-old said his experience is fueling his move away from the industry and into politics.\n\nHe ended up leaving his first two jobs because of moral issues he had with some of the deals he worked on. Now, Moran, who calls himself a populist, is running on a platform that, in many ways, is a rebellion against his old line of work.\n\n\"I'm like, wait, these people are the quote-unquote titans of the universe?\" he told Business Insider, reflecting on his first impressions of working on Wall Street.\n\nOne of his proposals is to ban corporations from owning single-family homes, similar to an executive order President Donald Trump recently signed to curb home ownership by institutional investors.\n\nAnother proposal is to reform campaign finance laws to keep Wall Street and corporate money out of politics.\n\n\"We have a captured legislative branch,\" he said. \"I'm very much against the control that Wall Street has been able to have over politicians.\"\n\nMoran also wants to take on a Wall Street darling right now: AI data centers, which are fueling the AI buildout that's helped drive the S&P 500 up by 94% since late 2022.\n\nHe's proposing a tax on data centers that would fund community colleges.\n\n\"Someone is gonna come in, pay for the campaign of a Republican who's quote-unquote business-friendly, and they're gonna give designation as critical infrastructure to win our war of AI against China — which I want to happen, but the people are not going to get anything in return,\" Moran said.\n\n\"If we were to put a compute tax on the data centers, over the next 10 years, that could be $100 billion, if not more,\" he continued. \"That would be enough to entirely change the community college system to make it so that we could have universal community college.\"",

    "description": "Dan Ives says Wall Street is underestimating software's role in the AI boom, calling the skepticism \"disconnected.\"",
    "fullText": "Wall Street may be getting the AI trade wrong, says Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst and longtime tech bull.\n\nIves said on CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" published Tuesday that the recent investor pessimism toward software companies is 'the most disconnected call that I've ever seen.\"\n\nWhile much of the AI excitement has centered on data centers, chips, and GPUs, Ives said software will be the \"heart and lungs of the AI revolution.\"\n\nThe infrastructure buildout is still in its early innings and could stretch over the next decade. But software is where the real use cases and monetization will emerge, he added.\n\nIves said it is wrong to assume that big software companies like Salesforce and ServiceNow are \"structurally broken\" or set to be replaced by AI-native tools.\n\nThese companies are deeply embedded in enterprise stacks, with hundreds of thousands of customers, Ives said, adding that their AI use cases could unlock incremental revenue over the next six to 18 months that investors are not yet pricing in.\n\nLarge, entrenched platforms should not be compared to smaller players that serve small and medium-sized businesses. \"You cannot paint all of them with the same brush,\" Ives said.\n\nIves also defended Microsoft's role in the AI revolution. While acknowledging near-term concerns around capital spending and Azure growth, Ives said the broader AI rollout cannot succeed without Microsoft's software and cloud ecosystem.\n\nIves' comments came after software stocks tumbled last week amid investor fears that AI could disrupt large swaths of the industry.\n\nNot all tech and finance leaders think AI will replace traditional software companies. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed that idea at a Cisco AI event last week.\n\n\"There's this notion that the tool industry is in decline and will be replaced by AI,\" Huang said. \"You could tell because there's a whole bunch of software companies whose stock prices are under a lot of pressure because somehow AI is going to replace them. It is the most illogical thing in the world and time will prove itself,\" he added.\n\nHuang said AI depends on the tools software offers and pointed to ServiceNow, SAP, Cadence, and Synopsis as examples of software firms well-positioned in the AI era.\n\nIves also wrote in an industry note published last week that the \"software armageddon\" can be regarded as a tech stock \"garage sale.\"\n\n\"We believe the market is baking in a doomsday scenario for software companies in the near-term, which we believe is extremely overblown, as many customers won't be willing to put their data at risk to capitalize on AI implementation strategies until there is less risk with these migration projects,\" Ives and his analysts wrote.\n\nIves has long urged investors to buy tech dips, even as critics caution that AI enthusiasm may be running ahead of earnings and real-world adoption.",

    "title": "Power banks, body warmers, and antifreeze: Ukrainian troops tell us how they survive deep winter out in the trenches",
    "description": "For Ukrainian infantry and drone teams, the extreme cold brings new challenges to modern war in the trenches.",
    "fullText": "For Ukrainian infantry, surviving the dead of winter requires a delicate balance.\n\n\"It's really, really cold in Ukraine,\" said Nefor, the chief sergeant of an infantry company in Ukraine's 3rd Army Corps. \"I think, the first winter in some time with such cold weather.\"\n\nA cold snap whipped through much of Ukraine last week, delivering frigid temperatures that sank to -6°F on some nights in the northeastern region of Kharkiv, where Nefor's corps is fighting.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to him and another Ukrainian commander, who oversees a drone company on the front lines, to discuss what it takes to hold a trench position in such weather. Trench warfare, largely glossed over in the last few decades, has seen a resurgence in interest from militaries around the world, especially those in Europe, watching Russia's plodding invasion of Ukraine.\n\nNefor, who spoke on the condition that he only be identified by his callsign, is in charge of assigning infantry rotations to their frontline positions.\n\nWhile holding a position, a key item each soldier needs is chemical body warmers, which can be slipped under their uniforms, said Nefor.\n\n\"You put this warmer against your body, and your blood circulating is warm. It works, not bad,\" Nefor said. \"If you want to rest a little bit, you take a chemical warmer, a sleeping bag, and it's faster.\"\n\nAt such temperatures, frostbite can easily set in within 30 minutes, so troops constantly need the warmers, he said. One typically lasts six to eight hours, meaning a soldier needs at least three warmers per day, Nefor added.\n\nHis company experimented with electrically powered warmers. But they come with a risk — anyone who gets too warm would be more easily spotted by thermal optics, especially since their surroundings are much colder than usual.\n\nChemical warmers, conversely, emit such small heat signatures that light drones won't be able to spot them, Nefor said.\n\n\"It's possible to see if the Russian guy has a 'teplevizor' on his weapon, but it's a very small signature,\" the sergeant said, referring to thermal imagery attachments for small arms.\n\nSerhii Andrieiev, a senior lieutenant who is second-in-command of the \"Kraken\" drone company in the 3rd Army Corps, said his pilots prioritize camouflage for their nests during the winter. In the colder seasons, there is less forest foliage to provide visual cover.\n\nThe heat signature from the motors on their drones is easier to spot, and only \"very happy drone operators\" have the luxury of stationing in a building along the Kharkiv frontline, Andrieiev said.\n\n\"In most cases, it's a big foxhole, or a cellar in a destroyed building,\" the deputy commander said.\n\nAppliances such as electric warmers also soak up significant energy and require a power source in the trenches.\n\nNefor said his company deploys roughly 20 EcoFlow portable batteries, but there aren't enough to cover all its frontline positions. The batteries are also needed to power screens and radios, he added.\n\nAlmost all soldiers instead carry personal power banks to keep their devices charged. \"It's the power bank you buy at the shop,\" Nefor said. \"Power banks with Type-C or USB ports.\"\n\nCold temperatures can grow even more dangerous when they alternate between above and below freezing. Clothes, especially in humid areas, can absorb thawed water that can then freeze again, increasing the risk of hypothermia.\n\n\"If you are not dry, you die,\" Nefor said. \"We have this saying.\"\n\nClothing that gets wet in the winter stays wet, so troops who need dry layers have to request new ones from their commanders.\n\nUncrewed ground vehicles have recently been a major boon for Nefor's company in this regard, freeing up human soldiers by carrying weeks' worth of ammunition, clothing, and other supplies such as food, water, and chemical warmers to the trenches.\n\nFirearms and ammunition can become waterlogged as well. Nefor said that his troops, worried that their weapons would freeze up, apply a lubricating concoction to their rifles that mostly includes vehicle oil and sometimes a small amount of antifreeze.\n\n\"You need to make one, two shots with your weapon to make it warmer, then you add it,\" Nefor said.\n\nBoth commanders said the deep winter adds to the mental toll on Ukraine's already-beset troops, who are often short on reinforcements and the grinding nature of the war.\n\nNefor's company sends smaller groups of two or three soldiers — no more than four — to each position to avoid detection from Russian drones. Each soldier takes turns for several hours in the trenches between watch positions, which are typically colder, and warmer resting locations.\n\nAndrieiev said that if he had more drone pilots, he could rotate them out of the front lines every four or five days. His teams instead spend two to three weeks at a time in the forests.\n\n\"It's exhausting to spend all that time in freezing temperatures. Even if you have heaters with you,\" Andrieiev said.\n\nTroops need more fuel and more clothes to perform their duties, he said. A task as simple as using an improvised bathroom in the trenches is stressful, with the soldier under threat from Russian drones while wearing multiple layers, body armor, and carrying their military gear.\n\nThe Russian assaults they have to fight off, meanwhile, stay just as frequent and intense during cold weeks, Andrieiev said.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what the weather is. They come at us like zombies, two or three guys at a time in the middle of the frozen field,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "YouTube's top creator, MrBeast, is making a leap into fintech by buying a consumer banking app geared toward teens.\n\nHis company, Beast Industries, is acquiring Step, according to a joint announcement sent Monday.\n\nStep, which describes itself as an \"all-in-one\" money app, is a digital banking platform designed to help young people get their financial start. The company offers a mix of services, including savings accounts, a credit-building Visa card that functions similarly to a debit card, and a cash-advance program. Step itself isn't a bank. It offers its banking services via a partnership with FDIC-member Evolve Bank & Trust.\n\n\"Financial health is fundamental to overall wellbeing, yet too many people lack access to the tools and knowledge they need to build financial security,\" Beast Industries CEO Jeff Housenbold said in a statement. \"This acquisition positions us to meet our audiences where they are, with practical, technology-driven solutions that can transform their financial futures for the better.\"\n\nThe companies did not disclose the terms of the deal. Step said in 2022 that it had raised $500 million in equity and debt from institutional investors, including General Catalyst, companies such as Stripe, and individuals like TikTok influencer Charli D'Amelio.\n\nBeast Industries, which was valued at about $5 billion in its latest round of funding, has been looking for new avenues to make money beyond media, including the possibility of launching a mobile phone service down the road.\n\nMrBeast's candy and chocolate business, Feastables, has been a big money maker for the influencer, pulling in over $200 million in 2024 revenue, according to investor materials viewed by Business Insider. Not all ventures have paid off. The MrBeast team is currently embroiled in a legal battle with a business partner over the operations of its burger business, MrBeast Burger.\n\nThe content creator — who has over 460 million YouTube subscribers — has been planning to break into fintech for months, filing a US trademark application for the name \"MrBeast Financial\" in October. The company teased launching a fintech business with services like student loans, insurance, or credit insights in an early 2025 investor pitch deck, Business Insider first reported. The deck said the company would break into the industry by finding a partner who had existing infrastructure \"while avoiding regulatory, credit risk, and capital requirement.\"\n\nIn January, when Beast Industries announced it raised $200 million from ethereum holding firm Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Housenbold said the company would explore \"ways to further collaborate and incorporate DeFi into our upcoming financial services platform.\"\n\nAs the company prepares to enter the finance business, MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, also said he wants to make videos about finance, such as \"educating people on investing and showing them what is a Roth IRA.\"\n\nDonaldson, who has spoken on many occasions about his personal finances, said in a Monday post on X (formerly Twitter) that he saw the Step acquisition as an opportunity to \"give millions of young people the financial foundation I never had.\"\n\n\"Nobody taught me about investing, building credit, or managing money when I was growing up,\" he wrote.",

    "description": "The recent tech sell-off spooked Wall Street, sparking a rerating of AI stocks. One analyst shares his criteria for picking winners in the AI race.",
    "fullText": "The tech stock sell-off that rattled Wall Street last week served as a reminder to investors that AI hype works both ways, and endless enthusiasm is no longer lifting all boats.\n\nThe dramatic downturn hit software stocks hardest, but it also spilled into the broader tech sector. Major indexes have broadly recovered from last week's sell-off, but investors are still on edge about what could be the next shoe to drop.\n\nAccording to Futurum Group CEO and chief analyst Daniel Newman, the sell-off was a \"healthy, overdue rotation and a market demanding receipts.\"\n\n\"Ignore hype and look at growth and constraints,\" he told Business Insider. The analyst also shared some tips for picking AI stocks.\n\nHere is the framework Newman says he's using to spot winners and losers as the AI trade evolves.\n\nNot all companies spending on AI are seeing it pay off. While many on Wall Street chalk this up to the early innings of the emerging tech, companies that are seeing AI drive revenue are ones to look for.\n\n\"Companies need to show that the $470+ billion the hyperscalers are spending this year is generating returns. Those that do will be rewarded,\" Newman said.\n\nHe highlights Amazon and Microsoft as examples of AI spending fueling revenue real growth, through the tech giant'' respective cloud businesses, AWS and Azure.\n\nCompanies creating their own silicon chips are better positioned to compete. Capacity constraints control the AI race, with chip demand outpacing supply.\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are all working on their own custom AI chips.\n\nNewman highlighted that companies with in-house chips benefit from capacity advantages and vertical integration, which set them up for better margins.\n\nCompanies that have been successful in seeing a return on their AI spending have been largely focused on enterprise offerings. These include the cloud hyper scalers, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon, as well as Palantir, a favorite among retail traders.\n\nSome software companies are seeing enterprise monetization, despite the worries that sparked this week's sell-off. Newman highlights ServiceNow and IBM as \"companies driving agentic AI workflows and token consumption.\"\n\nElon Musk told Tesla investors on the company's most recent earnings call that its humanoid robot, Optimus, could generate up to $10 trillion in long-term revenue.\n\nNewman said that physical AI is the next multi-trillion-dollar market outside of data centers. He called out Amazon and Tesla as companies bringing AI to the physical world.\n\nThe market zeroed in on the software space for good reason, Newman said. \"I don't believe the AI will eat all software, but AI will eat some software,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nThe analyst explained that software companies with data running core business applications can survive in an AI era, but they will have to adapt to meet the needs of enterprise customers who want AI insights to fuel productivity gains.\n\nSome software companies partnering with AI factories include Salesforce and ServiceNow.\n\nAs AI-disruption concerns continue to fuel market skittishness, investors should be wary of companies without a clear narrative for how capex will deliver tangible results.\n\nAnother sign that an AI stock is risky may be that a company is using debt to finance AI infrastructure buildouts. Newman clarified that while debt isn't always a bad thing and can be a way to invest in critical growth, it can make a stock more of a risk-on play.\n\nIn a risk-off environment, Newman told Business Insider that there are a couple of things investors should be watching for.\n\n\"Look at the companies that can really afford to keep investing, for businesses that are going to basically create the cash flow that do it with the least risk.\"",

    "fullText": "Regulators in China want banks to dial back their holdings of US Treasury bonds.\n\nThe move, reported by Bloomberg on Monday, is likely to fuel fresh talk about the \"sell America\" trade and the appeal of the dollar. Chinese authorities cited concentration risk and volatility in US debt markets as the reasons for scaling back.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Chinese banks have been urged to limit new purchases, while those with high exposure have been told to dial back their investments.\n\nTreasury yields, which move inversely to prices, were slightly higher on Monday morning. The dollar dropped more sharply, with the Dollar Index down almost 1% on the news. The fresh dip in the greenback follows its recent decline to four-year lows.\n\nWhile the report notes that the regulators framed the directive around financial stability, rather than geopolitical maneuvering, it's likely to spur more debate in the market about countries' willingness to keep lending to the US.\n\nThe \"sell America\" trade, in which investors dump dollar-denominated assets from stocks to Treasurys, was a focal point of markets last year. It's been fueled by a combination of fiscal concerns amid record-high US debt and deficit spending, as well as weaker trust in US institutions amid threats to central bank independence and ongoing tariff threats. It's also been a force behind the debasement trade, which has boosted gold and other metals in the last year.\n\nBloomberg added that regulators did not specify how much exposure they believe Chinese banks should have to US debt at this time.\n\nData from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange shows that as of September 2025, Chinese banks collectively held $298 billion in US dollar-denominated bonds, but it's not clear how much of that is US Treasury debt.\n\nDonald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke by phone last week, and could meet in Beijing in April.",

    "description": "Private equity assets under management swelled to an estimated $6.7 trillion in 2025, up 72% over the last five years.",
    "fullText": "A lot of people are about to get rich from OpenAI's expected IPO. You probably won't be one of them.\n\nRetail investors will eventually get their shot. They'll be able to buy the stock, maybe even turn a tidy profit, once the company goes public. But they'll be showing up late to the party. As usual the real money, the kind that changes lives, will have already been made.\n\nThis isn't a one-off. It's a pattern that's becoming more common as companies stay private longer. Last year's post-IPO pops from names like CoreWeave and Figma showered early backers with riches. For everyday investors, it was a familiar gut punch. Both stocks now trade significantly below last year's highs.\n\nReddit and other online forums are littered with retailer investors complaining about being \"exit liquidity\" for venture capitalists and executives who cashed out early positions for huge gains. Individual investors who bought near the top are now left holding the bag.\n\nThe retail crowd knows they're missing out. That fuels resentment. Locked out of private markets, everyday investors often watch the biggest wealth-creation moments happen without them. If broad participation is supposed to be a pillar of capitalism, why has so much of the action moved behind a velvet rope?\n\nFor better or worse, many of those barriers to entry are coming down. Financial institutions are rolling out new products in private equity and credit markets aimed at everyday investors.\n\n\"The train has indeed left the station,\" said Stanford finance professor Amit Seru. \"The industry sees a once-in-a-generation chance to tap a vast pool of new capital.\"\n\nIn the latest installment of Business Insider's \"Future of Capitalism\" series, we explore the push to \"democratize\" private markets and what it means for retail investors. Retail access is expanding to investments that would've been unheard of years ago. They're finally getting a seat at the private-markets table.\n\nThe question now is whether that seat will ultimately be worth the risk.\n\nFor years, private markets swelled in size without much fanfare. That's changing.\n\n\"What we're finding is a lot of people are more curious about what they don't know about private markets,\" said Monish Verma, the CEO of Vardhan Wealth Management. \"They've been hearing more about it. They understand it's more than just equities and bonds.\"\n\nInvestment managers are looking to meet the moment.\n\nPrivate equity assets under management swelled to an estimated $6.7 trillion in 2025, up 72% over the last five years, according to data from the analytics firm Preqin. The firm predicts this number will swell to nearly $12 trillion by the end of the decade.\n\nAssets under management in private credit investments rose to $2.2 trillion last year, an 86% increase over the same time frame. Preqin predicts this will surge to $4.5 trillion by decade's end.\n\nUS policymakers have been warming to the idea that private markets should be opened up to more investors. In August, the SEC reversed a rule that had previously limited access to certain closed-end funds. That nudged the door to private markets a little wider for investors who are \"non-accredited,\" or those with a lower net worth than the markets are typically opened to.\n\n\"Financial innovation sometimes means getting out of the way of capital formation and allowing all investors to gain the benefits of our robust markets,\" Paul Atkins, the chair of the regulatory agency, said in prepared remarks last May.\n\nPrivate-market funds have been rolling out investment vehicles that aren't just for the ultra-rich. In the last year or so, the likes of KKR, State Street, and Apollo have launched a series of new funds and ETF products that offer the public access to public and private credit. SoFi, meanwhile, has debuted a handful of private markets funds specifically aimed at retail investors, with minimum investment requirements as low as $500.\n\n\"I certainly think it's not a fad,\" Robert Callagy, associate managing director at Moody's Investors Service, told Business Insider about the slowly expanding access to private investments.\n\nInvesting in public assets is inherently risky. In the event a company goes under, stock investors get paid last, if at all, with whatever is left over after a company reimburses its creditors.\n\nBut private markets are a different animal entirely, and come with their own unique set of risks. Some key differences might catch investors off guard, Callagy and Seru said.\n\nFor one, retail investors are used to being able to access their money easily. Private assets are less liquid and can be tougher to sell if you want to offload. SoFi's Cashmere Fund, which offers access to growth-stage companies backed by VCs, explicitly notes that it's aimed at long-term investors who don't need quick access to cash.\n\nRetail traders usually expect their money to be put to work right away, in vehicles like ETFs and mutual funds, Callagy said. This is often not the case for private-market funds, which tend to hold significant cash positions as managers scan the market for opportunities. The amount of private-equity money on the sidelines has been near record levels in recent quarters.\n\nThere also tends to be an information gap. Private companies aren't required to publicly disclose their earnings, debt, or other financial information. It's more difficult for an investor to know exactly what they're buying.\n\nCallagy says that the pressure to put cash to work could lead to more lax underwriting standards by money managers dealing with limited information.\n\nWhile access to private markets has expanded, retail investors, some of the supposed beneficiaries who spoke with Business Insider, don't seem convinced. The prevailing mood is distrust. Many see a version of capitalism where institutions still win, even as markets are branded more \"democratic.\"\n\nBilaal Dhalech, a 29-year-old day trader and an electrical engineer based in Toronto, is interested in accessing private companies because he feels like institutions currently have a leg up on him.\n\n\"They're getting in early, riding the value creation, and then exiting after the IPO,\" he told Business Insider, noting the post-offering stock skids that have befallen many recent market debutants.\n\n\"Having access earlier would level the playing field and absolutely change outcomes,\" Dhalech added.\n\nMinwoo Lim, a full-time trader who lives in Dubai, is more outright skeptical. In an interview, he said he believes institutional investors will continue to have an edge over the retail crowd, no matter how accessible private markets become. In his view, alternative asset managers will simply create a new structure that once again limits the most enticing private opportunities to institutions.\n\n\"If a private deal is available to retail, it's usually because the good part is already gone,\" Lim said. \"Institutions already took the real upside.\"\n\nDavid Villalobos, a trader based in Colorado, is more ambivalent. He said he's not interested in branching out into private markets, and that most retail traders have a tough time navigating public markets as they are.\n\n\"From my perspective, this push resembles prior bubbles we've seen in financial history,\" he said. \"Retail participants are likely to be attracted more by the narrative than the substance.\"\n\nIf Wall Street feels that skepticism, it isn't showing in its pursuit of expanding the reach of private markets.\n\nThe private equity industry has already successfully lobbied to allow private credit instruments into retirement funds, and big asset managers tout the benefits of diversification.\n\n\"You really need to be adding that private market exposure as a source of income, as well as a source of lower volatility,\" said Gargi Pal Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment and portfolio strategist for its Americas division.\n\nShe conceded that it's not for everyone, though.\n\n\"There's a liquidity premium that you will pay for that, but you're supposed to make that decision based on the portfolio that you have and the liquidity biases that you have.\"\n\nGoverning bodies have been clear that guardrails are needed. In a report from last fall, the SEC suggested a series of checks and balances designed to protect retail investors, ranging from investment limits to more robust disclosure requirements.\n\nSeru said he also believes in safeguards, like limits on the amount of illiquid private market assets allowed in ETFs. He also thinks there needs to be more transparency about who will provide liquidity in the market if there's a stress event.\n\nEventually, Seru says, the line between private and public markets will start to blur, to the point where the historical advantages of private markets are eroded.\n\n\"At some point, the quest for scale becomes self-defeating,\" he said.\n\nEven with rules in place, Seru only recommends private market funds to investors who can handle putting money into relatively illiquid funds for a long period of time.\n\n\"Done poorly, democratization simply transforms a high-performing asset class into a systemic risk machine,\" he added.",

    "description": "Private equity's years-long waiting game has sparked a $240 billion race on Wall Street. Inside the battle between banks to dominate in secondaries.",
    "fullText": "In the world of high finance, the secondary market — selling off pre-owned investments — was once considered Wall Street's version of a used-car lot. Few junior bankers clamored for the role, and bulge-bracket giants largely left the field to specialized boutiques.\n\nBut those days are over, and America's biggest investment banks are aggressively piling in.\n\n\"I used to have to explain the first 10 minutes of an interview what we do,\" Todd Miller, the global cohead of secondary advisory at longtime key player Jefferies, told Business Insider. \"It's a very hot industry. Everyone's trying to get into this space.\"\n\nIn the post-pandemic years of high interest rates and muted valuations, a capital bottleneck has pushed private equity exits well past the industry's typical timeline. That delay has tested investors who backed PE funds and expected returns a long time ago. So-called \"secondary\" and \"continuation vehicles\" — structures that let PE firms shift ownership of a company from one fund to another, while giving existing investors the chance to cash out — have emerged as a key workaround.\n\nIn a recent report, Jefferies said secondaries drove $240 billion in global transaction volumes last year, a 48% increase from the year prior.\n\nIn late January, JPMorgan Chase announced a new \"center of excellence\" in its investment bank: the Private Capital Advisory and Solutions group. Led by veteran banker Keith Canton, the former head of equity capital markets in the Americas, the team will advise companies on a spectrum of liquidity solutions. The symbolism was notable: a banker once focused on taking companies public is now helping them stay private longer. His newly formed group will draw on members of the bank's existing teams focused on private capital markets and advisory, he told Business Insider, with more hires expected over the coming year.\n\nMiller told Business Insider that the pace of the activity has become breathless. The banker estimated he spends as much as 20% of his time on recruiting, and his team — which counts some 130 heads — has grown by 50% over the past two years.\n\n\"I get a massive amount of inbounds on LinkedIn,\" Miller said. \"I've had kids writing to me on LinkedIn out of college, sophomores at elite schools. They want to do this job.\"\n\nFor banks like JPMorgan, establishing Canton's group helps position the firm to compete for the wave of PE spending expected to begin in the coming months. Buyside firms are sitting on trillions in unspent capital, and banks want to be on speed dial when they decide to deploy it, whether through an M&A transaction, an eventual IPO, or a chance to help clients generate the liquidity they need in between.\n\n\"If you're just waiting for the IPO market,\" Canton said, \"you have potentially missed out on some significant gains.\"\n\nIn recent decades, the capital markets have experienced a sea change. Underwhelming IPO debuts and the red tape of being publicly traded dissuaded more corporate boards from taking the plunge.\n\nMatters got more complicated after stubbornly high interest rates spiked around 2022, pumping the brakes on corporate dealmaking. In 2020, PE firms were flipping companies they'd owned for an average of five years. In 2025, the timeframe had stretched by more than a year, according to data from the data provider Preqin, a subsidiary of BlackRock.\n\nOther banks have also been busy hiring. Last month, London-based banker Andrei Brougham joined Goldman Sachs from Rothschild to steer its EMEA secondaries advisory business. In 2025, Moelis poached Matt Wesley, then Jefferies' global head of private capital, to run its advisory team.\n\nIf they play their cards right, the potential upside for these desks is significant. A February report from JPMorgan found that 76% of family offices still have no secondary private equity exposure, illustrating how much runway remains.\n\n\"It's a big business opportunity,\" Canton concluded. \"It's one that is very clearly strategic to the firm. It's where we think the markets are broadly going.\"\n\nBrianne Sterling, a headhunter who leads the investment banking practice at recruiting firm Selby Jennings, has seen an uptick in clients looking to bolster their private fund advisory capabilities. \"I think it's a really big hiring story,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nPrivate credit secondaries professionals are in demand, she said, reflecting the anticipated $17 billion in credit secondaries for 2025 that Jefferies projected last summer. And she added that some banks are poaching juniors from valuation groups and Big Four accounting firms. Their skills come in handy with pricing, which is long the most fraught part of these transactions, as limited partners scrutinize whether pricing practices are inherently fair.\n\nThe next wave will be cultivating sector-specific talent. Miller said that Jefferies is building eight- to 10-person verticals focused on niche areas like venture capital and growth funds, infrastructure, energy, and private credit — an indication that demand for these jobs isn't going anywhere.",

    "title": "Prediction: The Trump Bull Market Will Come to an Abrupt End From an Unlikely Source -- the Federal Reserve",
    "description": "Wall Street's foremost financial institutional has transformed from Wall Street's bedrock to a stock market liability.",
    "fullText": "From a purely statistical standpoint, Wall Street loves President Donald Trump. While getting from Point A to B was a roller-coaster ride, the widely followed Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), broad-based S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and growth stock-dependent Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) soared 57%, 70%, and 142%, respectively, during Trump's first, non-consecutive term in the Oval Office.\n\nSince his inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump bull market has taken shape, yet again. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have climbed by 13%, 15%, and 18%, respectively, through the close of trading on Feb. 3, 2026.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nWhile several catalysts are fueling this bull market rally, some of which can be directly attributed to Donald Trump's policies, there's also an unlikely headwind that threatens to completely halt this seemingly unwavering optimism in its tracks: the Federal Reserve.\n\nBefore diving into what's been working, some objectivity is needed. Based on data compiled by Carson Investment Research, 26 of the last 33 presidential terms, including the present term for Trump, have yielded a positive aggregate return for the Dow Jones Industrial Average or S&P 500. A president overseeing gains in the stock market is perfectly normal.\n\nOut of the 33 terms analyzed since March 1897, Carson Investment Group found Trump's first term yielded the eighth-best cumulative return. Spanning 129 years, Trump's initial foray in the Oval Office ranked in the top quartile among presidents.\n\nOne reason for this persistent optimism has been Trump's flagship tax and spending laws. In particular, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), signed into law in December 2017, permanently reduced the peak marginal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% (the lowest level since 1939).\n\nAlthough the purpose of lowering taxes for businesses is to encourage hiring, acquisitions, and innovation, perhaps the most visible effect of the TCJA has been a significant increase in share buybacks. Share repurchases for S&P 500 companies are estimated to have topped $1 trillion in 2025, representing an all-time high. For time-tested companies with steady or growing net income, buybacks can help boost earnings per share, making their stock more fundamentally attractive.",

    "description": "New research looks at how leading AI models hold up doing actual white-collar work tasks, drawn from consulting, investment banking, and law. Most models failed.",
    "fullText": "It’s been nearly two years since Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella predicted AI would replace knowledge work — the white-collar jobs held by lawyers, investment bankers, librarians, accountants, IT, and others.\n\nBut despite the huge progress made by foundation models, the change in knowledge work has been slow to arrive. Models have mastered in-depth research and agentic planning, but for whatever reason, most white-collar work has been relatively unaffected.\n\nIt’s one of the biggest mysteries in AI — and thanks to new research from the training-data giant Mercor, we’re finally getting some answers.\n\nThe new research looks at how leading AI models hold up doing actual white-collar work tasks, drawn from consulting, investment banking, and law. The result is a new benchmark called APEX-Agents — and so far, every AI lab is getting a failing grade. Faced with queries from real professionals, even the best models struggled to get more than a quarter of the questions right. The vast majority of the time, the model came back with a wrong answer or no answer at all.\n\nAccording to Mercor CEO Brendan Foody, who worked on the paper, the models’ biggest stumbling point was tracking down information across multiple domains — something that’s integral to most of the knowledge work performed by humans.\n\n“One of the big changes in this benchmark is that we built out the entire environment, modeled after real professional services,” Foody told TechCrunch. “The way we do our jobs isn’t with one individual giving us all the context in one place. In real life, you’re operating across Slack and Google Drive and all these other tools.” For many agentic AI models, that kind of multi-domain reasoning is still hit or miss.\n\nThe scenarios were all drawn from actual professionals on Mercor’s expert marketplace, who both laid out the queries and set the standard for a successful response. Looking through the questions, which are posted publicly on Hugging Face, gives a sense of how complex the tasks can get.\n\nOne question in the “Law” section reads:\n\nDuring the first 48 minutes of the EU production outage, Northstar’s engineering team exported one or two bundled sets of EU production event logs containing personal data to the U.S. analytics vendor … Under Northstar’s own policies, it can reasonably treat the one or two log exports as consistent with Article 49?\n\nThe correct answer is yes, but getting there requires an in-depth assessment of the company’s own policies as well as the relevant EU privacy laws.\n\nThat might stump even a well-informed human, but the researchers were trying to model the work done by professionals in the field. If an LLM can reliably answer these questions, it could effectively replace many of the lawyers working today. “I think this is probably the most important topic in the economy,” Foody told TechCrunch. “The benchmark is very reflective of the real work that these people do.”\n\nOpenAI also attempted to measure professional skills with its GDPval benchmark — but the APEX-Agents test differs in important ways. Where GDPval tests general knowledge across a wide range of professions, the APEX-Agents benchmark measures the system’s ability to perform sustained tasks in a narrow set of high-value professions. The result is more difficult for models, but also more closely tied to whether these jobs can be automated.\n\nWhile none of the models proved ready to take over as investment bankers, some were clearly closer to the mark. Gemini 3 Flash performed the best of the group with 24% one-shot accuracy, followed closely by GPT-5.2 with 23%. Below that, Opus 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro and GPT-5 all scored roughly 18%.\n\nWhile the initial results fall short, the AI field has a history of blowing through challenging benchmarks. Now that the APEX-Agents test is public, it’s an open challenge for AI labs that believe they can do better — something Foody fully expects in the months to come.\n\n“It’s improving really quickly,” he told TechCrunch. “Right now it’s fair to say it’s like an intern that gets it right a quarter of the time, but last year it was the intern that gets it right five or 10% of the time. That kind of improvement year after year can have an impact so quickly.”",

    "description": "Beyond back-office functions, Alexandra Mousavizadeh, CEO of Evident AI, said banks should focus on where they can differentiate themselves.",
    "fullText": "AI is no longer optional at banks. The road map, and showing how it pays off, is the hard part.\n\nAlexandra Mousavizadeh, the cofounder and co-CEO of Evident, which tracks AI use in the financial industry, said some AI capabilities are \"table stakes\" for banks at this point — think back-office functions like reviewing legal documents and routine onboarding tasks. Beyond that, though, Mousavizadeh banks need to double down on their \"competitive edge.\"\n\n\"If you've got a big chunk of your business in a certain area, the banks will double down on AI there,\" she said. For firms with a big wealth management business, that might mean helping advisors better analyze client data; for banks more focused on retail, it might mean prioritizing chatbots and customer engagement.\n\nBanks are pouring billions into AI, and the technology is expected to redefine 44% of the work done there by 2030, according to consulting firm ThoughtLinks. JPMorgan, which has snagged the top spot in Evident's ranking of AI maturity, has invested at least $2 billion into the technology and is rolling out tools across its more than 300,000-person workforce.\n\nSome investors and analysts are starting to wonder about the returns, though. On their latest earnings calls, executives at several bulge-bracket banks fielded questions about when AI-driven productivity and revenue gains will start showing up on balance sheets. Banks are under pressure to show that AI is helping them gain an edge.\n\nMousavizadeh said banks that have taken a \"centralized\" approach to technology decisions are often able to move faster and embed AI more seamlessly.\n\nHer comments on focusing on building AI into core areas of the business echo those of Dan Priest, the chief AI officer at consultancy PwC, who previously told Business Insider that companies that took a \"crowdsourcing\" approach to AI adoption had a \"fairly disappointing\" return on investment.\n\nPriest said a shift to a \"top-down\" approach has been more effective, allowing clients to focus on fewer tools and achieve deeper mastery of a smaller set of tasks.\n\nAI agents are top of mind as banks race to prove that their AI spend is worthwhile, but Mousavizadeh said the uptake is still in its early stages, particularly in externally facing roles, like bankers and traders. In those cases, agents will likely be combined with humans for the foreseeable future, as banks, some of the most highly regulated companies, work through what guardrails to install.\n\nFor the past six months, Goldman Sachs has been working with Anthropic on co-autonomous AI agents that can automate tasks in the firm, including accounting for trades and transactions, and client onboarding. The bank's tech chief anticipates that the agents will launch \"soon,\" and that it's too early to think they'll lead to job losses, CNBC reported.\n\nOver the past year, banks have shifted how they measure AI success, Mousavizadeh said, moving away from tracking specific use cases toward scaling capabilities. They're thinking about how to apply capabilities in one line of business to others, and build an internal \"architecture\" that allows AI to reconfigure workflows companywide.\n\nAchieving that scale requires a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches. Banks need to get technology into every employee's hands, Mousavizadeh said, and mandatory training often yields better results.\n\nBut mandates alone likely aren't enough.\n\n\"AI is a funny thing. You do need a culture where there's a lot of creativity,\" Mousavizadeh added.\n\nLooking ahead to the AI-integrated future, Mousavizadeh said that banks have a new \"North Star\": what does a fully AI-integrated bank look like a few years from now?\n\n\"You need to be able to work back from that,\" she said.\n\nMore than applying AI to preexisting products, that means creating new systems in the image of the bank of the future — and doing it faster than your competitors.",

    "fullText": "Some Wall Street banks are betting the US economy is going to run hot in the months and years ahead, predicting a stretch of high growth and hot inflation.\n\nBut David Kelly, the chief global strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, thinks things will be a little chillier than most are expecting.\n\nIn an interview with Business Insider this week, Kelly said that by the fourth quarter of this year, he expects to see both GDP growth and inflation under 2%. Given that the economy grew 4.3% in the third quarter last year and inflation was 2.7% in December, that might sound surprising.\n\nKelly's reasoning? Immigration numbers are falling, and that will eventually weigh on the labor pool and consumer demand.\n\n\"We're getting stimulus right now from income tax refunds, we may get some stimulus from tariff rebate checks, but all that's gonna fade in the fourth quarter of this year, and the economy really can't grow more than about 1.5% per year without some change in immigration numbers,\" Kelly said. \"I think that could allow for some more rate cuts in 2027 in a sort of soggier economy.\"\n\nHe pointed to January Census Bureau data that the agency said showed a \"historic decline in net international migration.\"\n\n\"I think a report that didn't get enough prominence last week was the Census Bureau report, which showed not so much what immigration did over the last year or the year that ended in July of 2025, but what they think is going on right now,\" Kelly said.\n\n\"Right now, they think that annual immigration to the United States is down to 321,000. If that's right, the working age population age 18 to 64, is falling by 20,000 people per month.\"\n\nGiven these numbers, Kelly said he's leaning away from parts of the market that could be sensitive to population declines, such as consumer staples and housing.\n\n\"I'd be a little cautious about consumer staples here,\" he said. \"I saw a large consumer staples company blaming some poor results on consumer worries or consumer income. It's not consumer worries or consumer income, it's a lack of consumers.\"\n\nKelly said investors are best off increasing their exposure to international stocks right now. While ex-US stocks have outperformed in the last year, they still have have cheap valuations relative to US stocks, he said. Plus, US investors are still historically under-indexed on international due to the long-run outperformance of US stocks in recent decades.\n\n\"Ask yourself one question: Where is there an embedded prejudice within markets?\" Kelly said. \"Where is there something where people almost irrationally hate something or irrationally love something?\"\n\n\"We saw this, after the tech meltdown after the dot com bubble burst. We saw that with financials in 2009,\" he continued. \"Well, today, what do people really hate? People hate international. US investors hate international.\"\n\nKelly said that it didn't necessarily matter which regions or countries outside the US to invest in, but to simply add exposure. Examples of funds that offer exposure to international stocks include the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF (VEU) and the iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF (IXUS).\n\nOutside of stocks, Kelly said he prefers municipal bonds over corporate credit because of the relative tax savings. In alternative assets, which are historically uncorrelated to stock movements, Kelly prefers the real estate, infrastructure, and global transportation themes.",

    "description": "As tech sells off, Wall Street is in the midst of a rotation that Piper Sandler analysts say should favor stocks in \"old economy\" sectors of the market.",
    "fullText": "Investors looking for refuge from the tech sell-off slamming Wall Street should look to the \"old economy.\"\n\nAnalysts at Piper Sandler offered a handful of ideas for weary investors weathering the tech sell-off this week. The latest rout, which started in a small corner of the software space, eventually spread to bigger names like Microsoft after an agentic AI update from Anthropic sparked AI replacement fears. The new bearish AI sentiment has bled into the wider tech sector, with a risk-off shift gripping investors in the last few days.\n\nWhile some commentators argue the software crash is overblown, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, others frame it as a healthy rotation away from tech.\n\nPiper Sandler analysts are in the \"rotation nation\" camp, seeing the tech sell-off as a shift to \"old economy\" plays in cyclical and value shares.\n\n\"The bull market is intact; however, it's not being led by the popular Tech and Growth favorites of investors. Instead, new momentum and leadership are emerging in cyclical and value sectors—Energy, Industrials, Materials, Staples, and Banks,\" they said.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 information technology sector is the worst performer in the index in 2026, down more than 6% year to date. The losses have been particularly pronounced in software this week, with the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF falling 17% in the last week.\n\n\"After years of focus on identifying stocks with the greatest potential AI exposure, concerns about disruption have pushed investors back toward 'real economy' industries, including those leveraged to recent signs of accelerating economic growth,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote this week.\n\nThe analysts examined industry exposure to AI automation compared to labor costs and sales to determine which spaces are most insulated. Some of Piper Sandler's \"old economy\" sectors, specifically energy, industrials, and consumer staples, were part of the same group Goldman flagged.\n\nGoldman analysts added that the sell-off has only sped up an existing market rotation into cyclical stocks.\n\n\"The investor search for insulation from AI disruption risk has accelerated the ongoing cyclical rally,\" they wrote.\n\nBeyond clear flight from stocks exposed to AI risks, BNY Investment researchers credit the rotation, in part, to a cyclical recovery in the US economy.\n\n\"The prevailing narrative in US equity markets is one of market broadening and leadership rotation, consistent with our view of a cyclical recovery in the US economy,\" the BNY analysts wrote.",

    "fullText": "US stock futures turned higher early Friday, pointing cautiously to a rebound from a tech bruising as Wall Street reassessed worries about the impact of AI disruption and the risks of hefty Big Tech spending.\n\nS&P 500 futures (ES=F) rose 0.5%, while Nasdaq 100 futures (NQ=F) added 0.7%, retracing earlier premarket losses. Contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F) also switched course, moving up 0.4%, on the heels of sharp closing losses on Wall Street on Thursday.\n\nThe tentative risk-on tone extended beyond stocks, as bitcoin (BTC-USD) climbed back above $65,000, having touched a 16-month low overnight. But the biggest cryptocurrency is still on track for its worst weekly performance since 2022 after wiping out all of its post-Trump gains this week.\n\nStrategy (MSTR) revealed a loss for the quarter that was precipitated by that steep sell-off, which initially weighed on shares. But the stock was up almost 6% before the bell as bitcoin revived and Strategy's CEO played down concerns about debt-servicing risks.\n\nSome tech gloom persisted, as Amazon's (AMZN) shares tumbled 8%. In its earnings, the major cloud provider outlined plans for a massive 2026 jump in spending to least $200 billion, even as its forecast for operating income fell short.\n\nElsewhere, Stellantis (STLA, STLAM.MI) warned it will take a charge of over €22 billion ($26 billion) in a plan to scale back its EV push. Shares in the Jeep maker tanked over 20% on Wall Street and in Milan, adding to a picture of EV malaise painted by this week's $60 billion wipeout for Chinese carmaker BYD (BYDDF, 1211.HK).\n\nIn commodities, silver (SI=F) whipsawed but broadly resumed its decline as Chinese selling continued ahead of a national holiday.\n\nLooking ahead, the release of the closely watched January jobs report, originally scheduled for Friday, has been pushed to Wednesday next week. Fresh signs of trouble in the labor market emerged this week, as job openings sank to their lowest level since 2020 and layoff announcements surged.\n\nJeep maker Stellantis (STLA, STLAM.MI) warned on Friday that it will book a €22.2 billion ($26 billion) charge as it scales back its EV push.\n\nShares plummeted over 20% in premarket on Wall Street and in Milan, where trading was halted briefly. They plunged as much as 24% in Italy, the biggest drop on record for the Peugeot and Fiat automaker, to erase over €5 billion off its market cap.\n\nReddit (RDDT) stock jumped 7% before the bell on Friday after posting better-than-expected fourth quarter results and issuing positive guidance, helped by AI tools to bring more marketers to the platform.",

    "description": "On the earnings call, analysts pushed CEO Andy Jassy for assurances on future returns from this capex boom.",
    "fullText": "Amazon said Thursday it plans a staggering $200 billion in capital expenditures this year, sparking concern that the AI spending boom has entered an even more bubbly stage.\n\nThe company's capex forecast was more than $50 billion above Wall Street expectations. That left some analysts uneasy about whether these huge investments will pay off.\n\n\"The strong long-term return on investing capital — I think that's the debate in the market today,\" Mark Mahaney, a tech analyst at Evercore ISI, said during a conference call with Amazon executives following the results. \"So could you give us a little bit more insight into how you think investors will be able to see that?\"\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said new AI capacity is being monetized as quickly as it is deployed, calling it \"a very unusual opportunity,\" and argued that AI adoption is accelerating customers' shift to the cloud. He added that AWS' experience forecasting demand helps limit wasted capacity.\n\n\"This isn't some sort of quixotic top-line grab,\" Jassy said during the call. \"We have confidence that these investments will yield strong returns on invested capital.\"\n\nJassy's comments did little to calm investors. Amazon shares fell more than 10% in extended trading after the company detailed its outsized spending plans. A profit forecast also missed Wall Street expectations, adding to ROI concerns.\n\nBig Tech's AI infrastructure buildout has entered a new, breathtaking phase in recent days. On Wednesday, Google said it expects capex of $175 billion to $185 billion in 2026, well ahead of Wall Street estimates. Meta and Microsoft also raised capex.\n\nDuring Thursday's Amazon earnings call, other analysts pressed for assurances around returns on investment. JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth asked Jassy whether the company had \"financial guardrails\" in place for the spending plan.\n\nJassy said AI represents an \"extraordinarily unusual opportunity\" that could reshape the scale of AWS and Amazon. He said the company's in-house chips, Trainium and Graviton, are on track to generate more than $10 billion in revenue this year and added that its partnership with Anthropic has gone \"very well.\"\n\n\"We see this as an unusual opportunity, and we are going to invest aggressively here to be the leaders like we've been the last number of years,\" Jassy said.\n\nJassy described the AI market as \"barbelled,\" with heavy spending by leading AI labs on one end and productivity-focused enterprise uses on the other.\n\nHe said the middle — enterprise production workloads and new AI-native businesses — remains early but could become \"the largest and the most durable\" source of demand as costs fall and adoption broadens.\n\n\"The lion's share of that demand is still yet to come in the middle of that barbell, and that will come over time,\" he said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) dropped to $67,000 per token on Thursday, falling to its lowest level since 2024 as selling pressure intensified.\n\nThe token extended losses from the prior session after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signaled that the US government would not step in to support the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIn a heated back-and-forth during a House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, Bessent was asked if the US Treasury had the authority to buy bitcoin or other cryptos.\n\n\"I do not have the authority to do that, and as chair of FSOC, I do not have that authority,\" Bessent stated.\n\nBitcoin fell to as low as $67,073 apiece early Thursday, continuing Wednesday's slump that followed Bessent's comments.\n\nThe decline was also fueled by the broader selling pressure in markets and a warning from notable investor Michael Burry that a sustained decline in bitcoin's price could \"set in motion a death spiral leading to massive value destruction.\"\n\nWhat are analysts saying about Bitcoin's support levels?\n\nWhy did Bitcoin drop to $67,000 Thursday?\n\nHow has Bitcoin performed year-to-date in 2024?\n\nWhat did Treasury Secretary Bessent say about crypto?\n\n\"Bitcoin has been exposed as a purely speculative asset, and is not near the debasement trade hedge that gold and other precious metals are,\" Burry, who rose to prominence after predicting the 2008 financial crisis, wrote in his Substack.\n\nThe move lower on Thursday only added to bitcoin's recent rout. The world's largest cryptocurrency is down nearly 20% year-to-date.\n\nBitcoin dropped sharply last weekend to notch its fourth straight month of losses.\n\nThe move lower coincided with President Trump's announcement last Friday selecting Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve when Jerome Powell's term ends in May, a nomination markets view as hawkish.\n\nEther (ETH-USD) and other digital tokens also slid.\n\nAfter bitcoin earlier broke through the key support level at $73,000, 10X Research strategists wrote that \"current flows suggest sentiment has shifted meaningfully.\"\n\nThe firm's strategists pointed to flow and positioning data, which indicated \"investors are not yet positioned to buy the dip.\"\n\n\"While sentiment and technical indicators are approaching extreme levels, the broader downtrend remains intact,\" the researchers wrote. \"In the absence of a clear catalyst, there is little urgency to step in.\"\n\nThe firm noted that traders remain focused on deleveraging and unwinding their positions rather than on preparing for a typical snapback rally.\n\nPressure on digital assets reflected the broader fragility across the crypto market. Aside from a brief bounce last month, bitcoin has struggled since October, when whale selling and forced liquidations swept through the industry.",

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) have now slipped into negative territory for 2026.\n\nAnd after the bell, Amazon (AMZN) added to the gloom. Shares plunged over 10% in after-hours trading after the company posted earnings per share that missed Wall Street estimates and projected capital expenditures of $200 billion for the year, raising concerns about the extent of AI spend.\n\nThe risk-off tone extended beyond equities. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued sliding, touching levels not seen since 2024, while silver (SI=F) resumed its decline after a recent surge fueled by retail investor interest. Strategy (MSTR) revealed a loss for the quarter that was precipitated by bitcoin's sell-off, sending shares down.\n\nEarnings also drove Reddit (RDDT) upward after reporting a quarterly earnings beat, issuing upbeat guidance, and announcing a stock buyback program. Roblox (RBLX) shares also surged. Looking ahead, investors will focus on earnings from Toyota (TM) and Philip Morris (PM), due before Friday’s opening bell.\n\nMeanwhile, the closely watched nonfarm payrolls report, originally scheduled for Friday, has been pushed to Wednesday next week following the resolution of the federal government shutdown. But other data this week has shown fresh signs of trouble for the labor market, as job openings sank to their lowest level since 2020 and layoff announcements surged.",

    "description": "Wall Street is looking to Amazon with high hopes after a rough week in tech, as silver plunges again and bitcoin drops near $65,000.",
    "fullText": "US stocks took sizable hits again on Thursday in a fruitless search for a reprieve from a building tech sell-off as investors awaited Amazon earnings, assessed Alphabet's big AI spending plans, and digested jobs data that signaled fresh weakness in the labor market.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved roughly 1.2% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost over 1.1%, or more than 500 points.\n\nThe market is in the midst of a full-on tech wipeout, as investors weigh whether some software stocks took too big a beating. The losses have been spurred by worries about AI disruption to established software players — a risk that had been overlooked by investors focused on the fallout from massive AI spending until recently.\n\nWall Street is still digesting the latest batch of corporate earnings, with Big Tech's AI build-out and demand in high focus. Alphabet (GOOG) shares slid, but pared losses, after the Google parent outlined a significant ramp-up in AI investment — to as high as $185 billion — in its quarterly results late Wednesday.\n\nThe countdown is now on to Amazon's (AMZN) report, set for release after Thursday's market close. Eyes are on the all-important AWS cloud unit, expected to deliver a 21% jump in sales.\n\nMeanwhile, the labor market flashed fresh signals of weakness: Weekly jobless claims rose more than expected, and job openings sank to their lowest level since 2020, while a new report found that last month marked the worst January for layoff announcements since 2009. The government's monthly jobs report is due next Wednesday.\n\nElsewhere, silver (SI=F) plunged as much as 17%, erasing all of its two-day recovery as Chinese buyers dumped holdings. Wall Street is debating whether the recent record rally in silver and gold (GC=F) ran too high, too fast — and if a further slump awaits.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) also plunged to its lowest level since 2024, wiping out all of the gains accumulated during President Trump's second term. The token broke below $63,000 — amid a crisis of confidence.\n\nYahoo Finance's Francisco Velasquez reports:\n\nSilver (SI=F) prices tumbled 14% on Thursday to hover above $75 per ounce, erasing gains from the past two days. Gold (GC=F) futures also slipped to $4,900 per ounce after both metals had risen for a second consecutive day following last Friday’s sell-off.\n\nAnalysts warned that silver’s short-term rebound remains volatile, though they remain bullish on bullion prices over the medium term, despite last week’s dramatic pullback that interrupted a blistering rally over the past year.\n\n\"The widening divergence between gold and silver performance reinforces a recurring theme: silver behaves less like a monetary metal during periods of stress and more like a high-beta hybrid, amplifying both optimism and fear,\" Ole Hansen, Saxo Bank's commodity strategy head, wrote on Thursday.\n\n\"History suggests that silver tends to stabilise only once realised volatility falls and speculative positioning is reset — conditions that are not yet fully in place,\" he added.\n\nYahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports:\n\nMortgage rates barely budged this week: The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage edged higher to 6.11% from 6.10%, while the 15-year fixed averaged 5.50% ticked up to 5.5% from 5.49% last week.\n\nYahoo Finance's Hal Bundrick and Laura Grace Tarpley note that the 10-year Treasury note, a pricing indicator for 30-year fixed mortgage rates, has hovered above 4.2% since mid-January. However, the spread between Treasurys and mortgage rates has narrowed recently, and the 30-year has resisted a substantial move higher.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nCheck out frequently asked questions about mortgage rates and our mortgage calculator here.\n\nYahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports:\n\nYahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi writes:\n\nCheck out the top takeaways from Sozzi and Schwab's conversation here.\n\nIt hasn't been a great day for jobs data, with the delayed JOLTS report serving as the final piece in a trifecta of negative news about layoffs, hiring, and unemployment claims.\n\nYahoo Finance's Emma Ockerman reports:\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) tumbled below $64,000 on Thursday, its lowest level since October 2024.\n\nThe token is down nearly 50% from its all-time high last year, erasing all the gains made during President Trump's second term. Investors had been optimistic that the administration's crypto-friendly policies would lift digital-asset prices.\n\n\"Bitcoin remains in a larger bear-market structure,\" read a 10X Research note on Thursday. \"In the absence of a strong catalyst and with positioning still stretched, downside risks remain elevated.\"\n\nNotably, the firm points to a significant overhang — overexposed bitcoin ETF holders who are underwater, with an estimated average acquisition price near $90,000.\n\nA similar dynamic is playing out with ether (ETH), which tumbled 13% on Thursday. Investors holding Ethereum ETFs are down approximately 31% from their average cost basis, according to 10X Research data.\n\n\"Under these conditions, attracting incremental allocations from Wall Street investors becomes increasingly difficult, particularly when many existing holders likely regret not reducing exposure at significantly higher levels,\" the note said.\n\nAbsent a significant catalyst, the firm doesn't see a bottom to crypto's bear market until possibly the summer.\n\n\"As we have previously outlined, a cycle low around the FIFA World Cup this summer could mark a more compelling long-term buying opportunity,\" 10X Research analysts said.\n\nPeloton (PTON) shares fell more than 20% after the company reported its fiscal second quarter earnings and announced its CFO will be exiting.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports:\n\nHims & Hers (HIMS) shares soared as much as 9% as the company said it will begin selling compounded copies of Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Wegovy pill. The pill from Hims & Hers would cost about $100 less than Novo's, Reuters reported.\n\nNovo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY) both saw shares tumble about 7% on the news.\n\nSoftware stocks have been hammered in the past few days, accelerating a months-long decline as investors become more fearful of disruption risks posed by new artificial intelligence tools — particularly those from Anthropic.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai was asked about the market belief that software stocks are losing ground during a call with analysts following the Google parent's earnings report Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe CEO said: \"Look, at least from my vantage point, I definitely see we have very, very good SaaS (software as a service) customers who are leaders in their respective categories.\"\n\nThose customers include Intuit (INTU), ServiceNow (NOW), and Salesforce (CRM), per Bloomberg data.\n\nPichai continued: \"And what I see the successful companies doing is they are definitely incorporating Gemini deeply in critical workflows, be it on improving their product experience and driving growth or using it to drive efficiency within their organizations.\"\n\n\"[J]ust like it has been an enabling tool for us across our products and services.. I think the [software] companies who are seizing the moment, I think, have the same opportunity ahead.\"\n\nHis comments echo those of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang this week.\n\nRead more about what's driving fears over AI eating into the competitive moats of SaaS leaders here.\n\nThe performance of Amazon's (AMZN) cloud business, AWS, will be keenly examined when its earnings report lands later, after Microsoft (MSFT) stock plunged last week, in part due to a slowdown in cloud growth.\n\nThis was not an issue for Amazon’s October earnings, as its shares jumped almost 10% following better than expected revenue from Amazon Web Services, also known as AWS. Now, however, fear is rippling through the tech sector, and Amazon investors are increasingly concerned that the slowdown at Microsoft’s Azure indicates broader weakness for cloud providers.\n\n“It isn’t clear how much of Microsoft’s disappointment might be due to company-specific issues and how much might reflect an overall slowing in the cloud space,” said David Miller, chief investment officer at Catalyst Funds, which holds Amazon shares in several portfolios. “If it’s the latter, that could carry over.”\n\n... Amazon’s results come against a backdrop of anti-software sentiment that’s weighing on the entire tech sector as investors try to sort the winners and losers from the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent to develop artificial intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft’s aggressive AI-related capital expenditures, alongside the slowing Azure growth, invited new questions about when these investments will pay off more substantially.\n\n“It’s really about what’s already priced into the stock, and I think what was starting to price in for [Microsoft] was a higher growth rate, which is always a little dangerous,” said Melissa Otto, head of technology, media and telecommunications research at Visible Alpha. “We haven’t really seen Amazon moving up in the same way.”\n\nAt the market open, US stocks plunged for a third day as a broad sell-off in tech names continued.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way lower, sinking 1.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) shed 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which includes fewer tech stocks, fell 0.5%.\n\nUS weekly applications for unemployment benefits increased by more than expected last week, as snowstorms across much of the country may have led more people to file for assistance.\n\nJobless claims for the week ending Jan. 31 increased by 22,000 to 231,000 claims, exceeding economists' forecasts, the Labor Department reported Thursday.\n\nContinuing claims, a proxy for the total number of people receiving state unemployment benefits, increased to 1.84 million.\n\nDistortions from winter weather notwithstanding, the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits suggests the labor market remains broadly stable if not cooling gradually.\n\nThough in a sign of cracks appearing in the \"low hire, low fire\" trend that has characterized the labor market for over a year, layoffs jumped in January to their highest level for that month in 17 years, according to Challenger data (scroll down for more on this).\n\nYahoo Finance's Emma Ockerman reports:\n\nYahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban reports:\n\nJeff Bezos came, he saw, he conquered.\n\nMaybe not in the way you'd expect from a onetime financial savior of an iconic newspaper. There are now two Bezos eras at the Washington Post: The first started when he rescued it in 2013. The second began when he saw it gutted, blessing mass layoffs the company executed on Wednesday.\n\n... On social media and in news coverage in the aftermath, Post employees, the labor union, and alumni (myself included) strongly criticized the decision.\n\nOthers have pointed to more recent moves by Bezos.\n\nLeading up to the Post's deep cuts, several media observers highlighted Amazon's enormous budget to produce and market the new documentary \"Melania,\" about first lady Melania Trump.\n\nAmazon's extraordinary spending prompted questions about the movie working as a kind of bribe from Bezos to the White House. (Amazon says they licensed the movie because they think people will love it. The film's Rotten Tomatoes scores and box office numbers have inspired a news cycle of their own.)\n\nBut the splashy Melania rollout provided an ugly contrast to the austerity Bezos was serving down to the Post's newsroom. In the worst light, critics said Bezos was willing to burn money to please the president but was now unwilling to do so for journalism in the public interest.\n\nRead more here in the takeaway from today's Morning Brief.\n\nChinese EV maker Nio (NIO) sent its shareholders a profit alert on Thursday morning, letting them know that the company expects to post its first-ever profit in the fourth quarter.\n\nNio said it will see an adjusted profit from operations of 200 million Chinese yuan (approximately $29 million) to 700 million yuan (approximately $100 million).\n\nThe company attributed the profit to sustained sales growth, improved margins from its product mix, and ongoing cost-cutting measures.\n\nNio stock popped 6% in premarket trading.\n\nEstee Lauder (EL) shares slumped 10% before the bell on Thursday, despite beating analysts' estimates on earnings per share and revenue, as tariff woes sent the beauty group's shares tumbling.\n\nStrategy (MSTR) stock fell over 5% during premarket hours on Thursday after bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell below 70,000. Strategy is one of the largest corporate holders of cryptocurrency.\n\nTapestry (TPR) stock rose 5% before the bell. Coach's parent company beat analysts' estimates on revenue and raised its full-year guidance.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) US-listed shares rose 5% before the bell on Thursday after announcing plans to issue its first dividend to shareholders, along with a three-year stock buyback program worth $5 billion.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) tumbled, falling $71,000 per token on Thursday after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the US government would not bail out the cryptocurrency.\n\nBut the leading cryptocurrency was paring deeper overnight losses in the wake of Bessent's comments, after entering the key mid-$70,000 support region.\n\nYahoo Finance's Ines Ferré and Grace O'Donnell report:\n\nSnap (SNAP) stock galloped higher after a strong holiday quarter for advertising lifted earnings above Wall Street's estimates.\n\nSnap stock rose 6% before the bell on Thursday.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, the video messaging app reported revenue of $1.71 billion and earnings per share of $0.03. That beat Wall Street estimates of $1.7 billion in revenue and a $0.03 loss per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (ELF) demonstrated resilience in the fourth quarter following a difficult 2025, with a strong earnings beat and guidance raise.\n\nThe affordable cosmetics manufacturer lifted its full-year 2026 sales outlook to a range of $1.6 billion to $1.61 billion from its previous range of $1.55 billion to $1.57 billion. The company also sees greater earnings per share of $3.05-$3.10, an increase from the previous range of $2.80-$2.85.\n\nThe stock soared by as much as 8% in premarket trading on Thursdayas the company looks to regain its footing after higher tariffs and other challenges led the stock to lose 40% in 2025. However, the stock pared some of those gains, perhaps due to lower gross margins amid ongoing tariff costs.\n\nLast year, the company also acquired Hailey Bieber's Rhode brand.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, e.l.f. reported better-than-expected earnings per share of $0.65 versus $0.55 expected by Wall Street analysts. Net sales jumped 38% to $489.5 million, topping estimates of $461 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\n\"Our value proposition, powerhouse innovation and disruptive marketing engine continue to fuel our brands,\" CEO Tarang Amin said in a statement. \"We remain confident in our ability to grow market share and deliver best-in-class growth in beauty, as reflected by our raised fiscal 2026 outlook.\"\n\nRead more about e.l.f.'s quarter from Reuters.\n\nArm Holdings shares fall as licensing sales miss estimates.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) stock rose 5% before the bell on Thursday following Alphabet's (GOOG) capital expenditure plans, which surpassed analysts' expectations.\n\nGoogle's parent company forecast 2026 capital expenditures of $180 billion, news that is a potential boon to Broadcom, which partners with Alphabet on custom chips.\n\n“That is an incredible number. We are laughing because that number is so good for the Google cohort,” Ben Reitzes, Melius Research head of technology research, told CNBC.\n\nGoogle is not the only company increasing its capex spend to build AI data centers: Oracle (ORCL) is doing the same and raised its forecast to around $50 billion.\n\nGoogle's AI software doesn't just use Nvidia (NVDA) chips, but it also uses its own tensor processing units (TPUs). For Gemini 3, Google used TPUs, which Broadcom helped to make.\n\nSilver (SI=F) fell sharply, wiping out a two-day recovery, as the white metal struggled to find a floor following a historic market rout. Gold (GC=F) also declined.\n\nSpot silver plunged as much as 17% on Thursday, having flickered briefly above $90 an ounce in early Asian trading. After a record-breaking rally that appeared to run too far, too fast, the metal has retreated by more than a third from an all-time high hit on Jan. 29.\n\n“Sentiment seems to have turned soggy across most asset classes, including regional equities and metals,” said Christopher Wong, a strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. This has created “a feedback loop amid thin market liquidity,” he said.\n\nThe sudden and sharp decline in precious metals also weighed on sentiment in base metals markets, with copper falling more than 1% to slip below $13,000 a ton. Meanwhile, spot gold dropped as much as 3.5% in choppy trading.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) stock fell around 11% in premarket trading on Thursday after the chip designer's results beat on the top and bottom lines but its forecast was lighter than expected. A memory chip shortage stemming from data center developers scooping up chips and chipmakers shifting production to cater to AI demand added pressure to the company's outlook.\n\nIn the fiscal first quarter, the company said revenue increased 5% year over year to $12.3 billion, while earnings per share rose to $2.78. Qualcomm beat analyst estimates on the top and bottom lines, with consensus estimates forecasting $12.1 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $2.75, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nHowever, the outlook for the fiscal second quarter dimmed as a supply crunch in memory chips weighs on margins and the smartphone market.\n\nSecond quarter revenue is expected in the range of $10.2 billion to $11 billion (analysts were looking for $11 billion at the midpoint). Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 (the Street was hoping for $2.87).\n\n\"While our near-term handsets outlook is impacted by industry-wide memory supply constraints, we are encouraged by end-consumer demand for premium and high tier smartphones, and remain on track to achieve our fiscal 2029 revenue goals,” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said in the earnings release.",

    "fullText": "CryptoBy Vildana HajricSaveMany of the bullish Bitcoin narratives are suddenly breaking down all at once. Momentum signals are deeply oversold but aren’t triggering a bounce after a 40% plunge from the token’s peak; the much-hyped wave of demand from exchange-traded funds has given way to choppy flows; and it’s failing to behave like a hedge in times of geopolitical stress.",

    "description": "Jensen Huang called the sell-off \"the most illogical thing in the world.\" He's not the only one who has qualms with Wall Street's reaction.",
    "fullText": "Not everyone in finance and tech is sold on the idea that AI is going to kill the software business.\n\nWall Street's fears of AI-related disruption has been driving a sell-off of software stocks after the release of Anthropic's new industry-specific plug-in.\n\nFrom Nvidia's CEO dismissing the concerns, to Zoho's founder acknolweding the industry is \"ripe for consolidation,\" here's what leaders in tech and finance are saying:\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said software is a tool for AI to use, rather than replace.\n\n\"There's this notion that the tool industry is in decline and will be replaced by AI,\" Huang said during a recent Cisco AI event. \"You could tell because there's a whole bunch of software companies whose stock prices are under a lot of pressure because somehow AI is going to replace them. It is the most illogical thing in the world and time will prove itself.\"\n\nHuang named ServiceNow, SAP, Cadence, and Synopsis, as bright spots in the industry.\n\nSridhar Vembu, founder of Zoho, a cloud-based software company, said SaaS was \"ripe for consolidation\" long before the rise of AI.\n\n\"An industry that spends vastly more on sales and marketing than on engineering and product development was always vulnerable,\" he wrote on X. \"The venture capital bubble and then the stock market bubble funded a fundamentally flawed, unsustainable model for too long. AI is the pin that is popping this inflated balloon.\"\n\nVembu said he asks his employees to consider the possibility of the company's death.\n\n\"When we accept that possibility, we become more fearless and that is when we can calmly chart our course.\"\n\nSteven Sinofsky, who helped lead the development of Windows 7 and 8, said AI may change \"what we built and who builds it,\" but tales of software's demise are just \"nonsense.\"\n\n\"Wall Street is filled with investors of all types. There's also a community, and they tend to run in herds. The past couple of weeks have definitely seen the herd collectively conclude that somehow software is dead. That the idea of a software pure play will just vanish into some language model,\" Sinofsky wrote in a lengthy post on X. \"Nonsense.\"\n\nSinofsky said it is true some companies will fail. He also noted that such cycles have happened in retail and media.\n\n\"Strap in,\" he wrote. \"This is the most exciting time for business and technology, ever.\"\n\nArm CEO Rene Haas isn't panicking.\n\n\"As I look at enterprise AI deployment, we aren't anywhere close to where it can be,\" Haas told the Financial Times.\n\nHaas, who leads the SoftBank-owned semiconductor company, said the current market reaction is \"micro-hysteria.\"\n\nJPMorgan analyst Stephen Parker said investors shouldn't be too worried by the sell-off.\n\n\"We're seeing a rotation,\" Parker told CNBC. \"It's about a broadening of the recovery story. Cyclicals are picking up the slack, and it's not just the AI infrastructure plays and the hyperscalers that are driving markets higher.\"\n\nParker, the co-head of global investment strategy at JPMorgan Private Bank, said AI developments are likely to continue to cause disruption in the software industry.",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly dipped below $70,000 per token on Thursday after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the US government would not bail out the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn a heated back-and-forth during a House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, Bessent was asked if the US Treasury had the authority to buy bitcoin or other cryptos.\n\n\"I do not have the authority to do that, and as chair of FSOC, I do not have that authority,\" Bessent stated.\n\nBitcoin fell to as low as $69,936 apiece early Thursday, continuing the slump on Wednesday that followed Bessent's comments.\n\nThe decline was also fueled by the broader selling pressure in markets and a warning from notable investor Michael Burry that a sustained decline in bitcoin's price could \"set in motion a death spiral leading to massive value destruction.\"\n\nHow has Bitcoin performed in recent months?\n\nWhy did Bitcoin drop below $70,000 on Thursday?\n\nWhat did Treasury Secretary Bessent say about cryptocurrency?\n\nWhat technical factors are driving current crypto market weakness?\n\n\"Bitcoin has been exposed as a purely speculative asset, and is not near the debasement trade hedge that gold and other precious metals are,\" Burry, who rose to prominence after predicting the 2008 financial crisis, wrote in his Substack.\n\nThe move lower on Thursday only added to bitcoin's recent rout. The world's largest cryptocurrency is down nearly 20% year-to-date.\n\nBitcoin dropped sharply last weekend to notch its fourth straight month of losses.\n\nThe move lower coincided with President Trump's announcement last Friday selecting Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve when Jerome Powell's term ends in May, a nomination markets view as hawkish.\n\nEther (ETH-USD) and other digital tokens also slid.\n\nAfter bitcoin earlier broke through the key support level at $73,000, 10X Research strategists wrote that \"current flows suggest sentiment has shifted meaningfully.\"\n\nThe firm's strategists pointed to flow and positioning data, which indicated \"investors are not yet positioned to buy the dip.\"\n\n\"While sentiment and technical indicators are approaching extreme levels, the broader downtrend remains intact,\" the researchers wrote. \"In the absence of a clear catalyst, there is little urgency to step in.\"\n\nThe firm noted that traders remain focused on deleveraging and unwinding their positions rather than on preparing for a typical snapback rally.\n\nPressure on digital assets reflected the broader fragility across the crypto market. Aside from a brief bounce last month, bitcoin has struggled since October, when whale selling and forced liquidations swept through the industry.",

    "fullText": "Alphabet reports $34.5bn profit and revenue soars 48% in recent quarter as it plans a sharp increase in AI spending\n\nGoogle’s parent company, Alphabet, beat Wall Street expectations on Wednesday, and is planning a sharp increase in capital spending in 2026 as it continues to invest deeply in AI infrastructure.\n\nAlphabet on Wednesday reported profit of $34.5bn in the recently ended quarter, as revenue from cloud computing soared 48%.\n\nThe company also forecast spending between $175bn and $185bn this year, a figure much higher than analysts’ expectations of roughly $115bn.\n\nIn an earnings call, investors pressed Alphabet’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, on the significant increase. “We’ve been supply constrained, even as we’ve been ramping up our capacity. Obviously, our CapEx spend this year is an eye towards the future,” Pichai said, in response. “We are constantly planning for the long-term.” Pichai added that he expects Google to “go through the year in a supply-constrained way”.\n\nAlphabet’s chief financial officer, Anat Ashkenazi, elaborated on the ways Google is trying to free up capital. According to Ashkenazi, that includes constructing its own data centers “to ensure that we do it in the most efficient way”, having an AI-powered tool known as a “coding agent” write about half the company’s codes (before being reviewed by engineers), and using AI across departments, even for smaller tasks such as handling invoices.\n\n“We’re seeing our AI investments and infrastructure drive revenue and growth across the board, Pichai said.\n\nAlphabet’s annual revenue exceeded $400bn for the first time, Pichai added.\n\nThe company reported $113.83bn in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2025 – surpassing Wall Street estimates of $111.43bn. Earnings per share (EPS) also beat Wall Street expectations: the company reported $2.82 in EPS, compared with estimates of $2.63.\n\nThe report comes after several months of good news for the company in the AI race.\n\nThe newest version of Gemini, released by Google in November, is considered to be at the forefront of the generative AI industry, a development that has prompted panic at competitor OpenAI. Alphabet’s stock jumped 3% when Google debuted the model.\n\nThen in January, Google and Apple announced the company will start using Gemini to power AI features like Siri; the Apple assistant has previously faced criticism for not being as advanced and accurate as its competitors. Google’s valuation shot up to $4tn after the deal, making it the second-most-valuable company in the world.\n\nAnalysts viewed the multi-year agreement as a huge win for Google: the tech giant beat out competitors like OpenAI, and got access to Apple’s user base of 2.5bn active devices.\n\n“Gemini is becoming the AI engine for the world’s most successful software companies,” Pichai said on Wednesday.\n\nAlphabet’s projected spending on AI infrastructure means its capital expenditure could as much as double this year. Shares were volatile in after-hours trading, with investors weighing the swell in spending against surging revenue and profit.\n\nLike larger rivals Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure, Google Cloud has been grappling with capacity constraints, and Pichai said the expenditures were necessary “to meet customer demand and capitalize on the growing opportunities we have ahead of us”.\n\nBut investors have increasingly grown concerned about payoffs from AI investments, as the big cloud companies collectively spend massive amounts building out their infrastructure. Meta last week hiked capital investment for AI development this year by 73%.\n\nAs the AI arms race heats up, Google’s Gemini AI assistant app exceeded 750 million users per month, Pichai said, up by 100 million compared with November.\n\nThe driverless car division Waymo is working to integrate the AI model, and Google announced that its Chrome browser will adapt more Gemini AI features, too.\n\nGoogle is still dealing with scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators; the company has faced years of legal battles with US antitrust regulators over allegations it built an illegal monopoly over online search and advertising. That fight resurged this week when the Department of Justice and several states filed an appeal to a landmark antitrust ruling last year, in which a judge imposed only modest limits on the company’s contracts. The federal government wanted tougher restrictions. Google executives did not discuss the legal proceedings on the earnings call.",

    "description": "Business Insider was on the scene at a WSJ conference that brought together leaders from Blackstone, Lazard, and Citi.",
    "fullText": "Most people flock to Palm Beach for sunshine and an escape. But on Tuesday, Wall Street's elite got 40-degree weather and nonstop talk about one company: Anthropic.\n\nAs the morning session of The Wall Street Journal's Invest Live event kicked off, the AI startup announced its new \"Claude Cowork\" legal plugins, a tool designed to automate contract triage and NDAs. The news unnerved investors, dragging down indexes like the Nasdaq and tech stocks from Palantir to Oracle. Thomson Reuters had dipped 20% by mid-afternoon, experiencing one of its worst single-day drops as investors panicked that software investments deemed cutting-edge a few years ago could soon be rendered passé.\n\nPeter Orszag, CEO of the investment bank Lazard and a former Obama administration official, offered a sobering macro view. \"The US economy and the equity market at this point are highly levered bets with regard to AI taking off,\" he said. \"What I think you're seeing is when people get nervous about whether that'll happen.\"\n\nThat said, he didn't contest the tech's future — just that some key players might not be around in a few years. \"You can bet on the technology paying off,\" he said, \"but that the firms making the investments today are not necessarily the ones that benefit.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Jon Gray, president of Blackstone, which manages over $1.3 trillion, emphasized the lucrative effects of the mini-economy that's sprung up to meet the physical and infrastructural demands of the artificial intelligence boom.\n\n\"To us, you don't necessarily have to know who the winners and losers are going to be,\" Gray said. \"You know that the data centers, the autonomous vehicles, the robots, they're all going to plug into the wall, and there's going to be a lot of need for digital infrastructure.\"\n\nSeveral attendees had recently returned from last month's World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alps and were likely hoping to leave the chill behind. But alas, one woman I spotted was bundled up in fur, and I personally had to fish out a 10-year-old coat from the back of my closet to make it from my Uber to the event's entrance.\n\nAt lunchtime, we decamped to the courtyard for a salmon salad and sweet iced tea, and the conversation drifted between the rise of South Florida in the post-pandemic era and the outlook for financial sponsors' spending this year. But as we shuffled back to our seats for the afternoon's lineup of speakers, the chill returned as we caught up with the market's increasingly dour reaction to Anthropic's news.\n\nSteven Tananbaum, founder of GoldenTree Asset Management, saw an opportunity in the rout. For a credit specialist, \"indiscriminate selling\" is a chance to find value where others see only collapse. \"The idea that all software is the same is what's exciting,\" he said about the broad sell-off. \"There's just indiscriminate selling regardless of what the prospects are.\"\n\nThe day ended with a reminder that while the markets might be sweating over incremental news, the C-suite is playing a longer game.\n\nAs it happened, I got to ask the final question of the day's concluding speaker, Mark Mason, Citi's chief financial officer, who's stepping down from his role this spring. He pointed to the cost-saving potential of AI, which would free up more money for Citi to devote to advancing CEO Jane Fraser's mission: putting the bank's multiyear overhaul behind it. The bank is applying the tech to its most critical processes, he said.\n\n\"What will it take to actually drive greater efficiency in that process? And I think that's a much better approach than the way others have thought about use cases,\" he added, referring to other banks.\n\nEarlier in the day, Hemant Taneja, the CEO of General Catalyst, a major VC backer of Anthropic, conceded that the economy will shed jobs due to AI, urging attendees to focus on education to retrain workers. \"Never ever was there a case that every skill in any job can be better done by AI and robotics,\" he said, \"which is, I think, where we are headed in the next, not five, but 20 to 30 years.\"\n\nStill, some speakers, like billionaire activist Nelson Peltz, brought some levity to the proceedings. Peltz — famous for his high-profile corporate showdowns with executives like Disney's Bob Iger — expressed enthusiasm for technology that could pump out faster, simpler answers to his legal questions.\n\n\"Not being a lawyer, I'm sort of happy,\" he said, as anxious laughter coursed through the room.",

    "title": "Why Wall Street analysts see the tech-sell-off as overblown, and fueled by 'fear, not fundamentals'",
    "description": "Tech stocks are trading lower as investors assess whether AI could upend current software leadership. Analysts say the market reaction is overblown.",
    "fullText": "Bank of America analysts say Wall Street is blowing the latest AI fears out of proportion as the tech sell-off drags on.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is down about 2% on Wednesday, extending losses from Tuesday's session. Analysts say recent losses, fueled by AI disruption worries and some poorly received earnings, are overblown and don't justify the broad sell-off.\n\nThe sell-off kicked off in the software sector after AI start-up Anthropic introduced a new plugin for its Claude Cowork AI agent. The new tool is said to be more automatic in completing clerical tasks than conversational chatbots, fueling worries that AI will replace software and dethrone existing market leaders.\n\nWilliam Blair analysts say these fears are overstated, calling the new AI tool the latest \"boogeyman in software.\"\n\nThe analysts say that while there will be some AI disruption in store for software makers, it will be how companies adapt to the AI era that sets apart the winners and losers.\n\n\"There will naturally be some disruption, especially for point solutions, nice to have tools (as opposed to mission-critical systems), and vendors that are not able or willing to adapt to the new tech paradigm,\" they wrote, noting, \"This does not justify the broad-based indiscriminate selling we are seeing across the sector.\"\n\nBank of America compared the recent tech sector nosedive to the January 2025 sell-off fueled by Chinese AI DeepSeek, which spurred major short-term losses for Wall Street and erased $1 trillion in market capitalization in one day.\n\n\"In several respects, the current indiscriminate selloff resembles the DeepSeek-driven decline of Jan'25, which ultimately proved unfounded and was followed by higher capex and accelerating AI token growth.\"\n\nDespite investors' panic that DeepSeek marked a turning point in the AI arms race, major indexes not only recovered but ended 2025 up by double digits, fueled in large part by AI momentum. The analysts also noted that global cloud capital spending grew 69% in 2025 from the year-ago period, above previous forecasts in spite of worries.\n\nSoftware's dramatic downturn reflects negative investor sentiment around the sector, not a change in fundamentals.\n\nIn fact, Bank of America underlined the incongruence of Wall Street's thinking, which is driving \"inconsistency in AI stock moves.\"\n\n\"Price action implies AI capex is deteriorating to the point of weak ROI and unsustainable growth, while simultaneously suggesting AI adoption will be so pervasive and productivity-enhancing that long-standing software workflows and business models become obsolete. Both outcomes cannot occur at once.\"\n\nWilliam Blair analysts echoed a view calling software weakness a \"sentiment problem.\" They highlighted the post-earnings price declines in Microsoft and ServiceNow stocks, despite the companies' fundamentally strong prints. AMD saw a similar drop after its stock fell over 17% on Wednesday, despite earnings beating on the top and bottom lines.",

    "description": "Amazon stock has been a laggard among its Magnificent Seven peers, but Wall Street is bullish that the latest results will show AI-driven strength.",
    "fullText": "Amazon will be the latest Magnificent Seven company to report earnings this week, with the e-commerce giant's results due on Thursday after the closing bell.\n\nAs analysts noted in their pre-earnings takes, Amazon has lagged behind most of its mega-cap tech peers for much of the past year. Yet, despite the lackluster performance, many investment banks are optimistic that the company will reveal fresh growth from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and provide key AI updates.\n\nWall Street expects Amazon tp post earnings-per-share of $1.96 for the quarter and revenue of $211.2 billion to $211.56 billion. Analysts anticipate that Amazon's earnings before interest and taxes will be $24.6 billion.\n\nHere's what analysts say they will be listening for on Amazon's earnings call.\n\nBofA analyst Justin Post expects Amazon to come in slightly above Wall Street estimates on key metrics, predicting revenue of $213 billion and EBIT of $26 billion. He also thinks that AWS growth will accelerate in 2026, helping Amazon regain some momentum.\n\n\"We expect 22% y/y AWS growth (above Street at 21% and an accel from 20% in 3Q) as greater capacity drives incremental sales, and we think investors could also be around 22% y/y,\" he said.\n\nWhile JPMorgan analysts remain bullish on Amazon heading into earnings, they do note some concerns regarding Amazon's position and strategy when it comes to AI. They find the recent AWS price increases encouraging, though, as they indicate strong demand.\n\n\"We remain bullish on AWS growth acceleration driven by core cloud growth & ramping AI contribution led by Project Rainier, Trn ramp, & new partnerships,\" they wrote.\n\nThe analysts added, though, that despite some concern, AWS' growth and the company's cost discipline should support strong free cash flow growth in the coming year, even as Amazon ramps up AI capex.\n\nDeutsche Bank analysts aren't expecting Amazon's Q4 earnings report to quickly juice the stock's performance, but they do anticipate a positive quarter overall, particularly in e-commerce demand and AWS-driven revenue growth.\n\n\"While we don't expect 4Q earnings to be the magic bullet that changes these fortunes, we do expect another positive earnings outcome to continue to chip away at this underperformance and believe Amazon can be one of the largest outperformers in our coverage in 2026,\" stated analyst Lee Horowitz.\n\nUBS analyst Stephen Ju and his team increased their estimates for both AWS growth and Amazon's capex, citing the company's plans to double capacity by 2027.\n\n\"As 4Q25 results marks the second quarter of AWS acceleration, we expect investor conviction to continue to rise and drive outperformance as capital continues to rotate into AMZN shares,\" Ju stated in a note to investors.\n\nHe added that his team expects Amazon to benefit from its investments in areas such as gross merchandise volume, advertising, and data, which are expected to help increase its free cash flow.\n\nAmazon remains a top pick for Mizuho, who sees it as a winner of the online advertising boom. Analyst Lloyd Walmsley also thinks it stands to benefit from ongoing demand both for its AI services and its e-commerce business.\n\n\"As GenAI compute demand increasingly shifts to inference this plays to Amazon's strength and should help further boost revenues at AWS,\" he noted. \"On retail, we see ongoing cost-to-serve improvements from more automation in fulfillment centers and continued improvement in logistics architecture, aided by rapid growth in advertising driving improving retail margins.\"\n\nCorrection: February 4, 2026 — An earlier version of this story misstated the date of Amazon earnings as Wednesday. The report is on Thursday.",

    "description": "Bitcoin sank after Treasury Secretary Bessent said banks would not bail out crypto.",
    "fullText": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell 2% on Wednesday to around $73,000 per token after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the US government would not bail out the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn a heated back-and-forth during a House Financial Services Committee hearing, Bessent was asked if the US Treasury had the authority to buy bitcoin or other cryptos.\n\n\"I do not have the authority to do that, and as chair of FSOC, I do not have that authority,\" Bessent stated.\n\nThe decline on Wednesday was also fueled by the broader selling pressure in markets and a warning from notable investor Michael Burry that a sustained decline in bitcoin's price could \"set in motion a death spiral leading to massive value destruction.\"\n\n\"Bitcoin has been exposed as a purely speculative asset, and is not near the debasement trade hedge that gold and other precious metals are,\" Burry, who rose to prominence after predicting the 2008 financial crisis, wrote in his Substack.\n\nThe move lower only added to bitcoin's recent rout. The world's largest cryptocurrency is down 13% over the past five days.\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency dropped sharply last weekend, touching its lowest levels since last April and notching a fourth straight month of losses.\n\nThe move lower coincided with President Trump's announcement on Friday selecting Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve when Jerome Powell's term ends in May, a nomination markets view as hawkish.\n\nWhat are analysts saying about Bitcoin's support levels?\n\nHow has Bitcoin performed over recent months?\n\nWhat is Michael Burry's warning about Bitcoin's decline?\n\nWhy did Bitcoin drop after Treasury Secretary Bessent's comments?\n\nEther (ETH-USD) and other digital tokens also slid.\n\nWith bitcoin's next support level at $73,000, \"current flows suggest sentiment has shifted meaningfully,\" 10X Research strategists wrote in a recent note.\n\nThe firm's strategists pointed to flow and positioning data, which indicated \"investors are not yet positioned to buy the dip.\"\n\n\"While sentiment and technical indicators are approaching extreme levels, the broader downtrend remains intact,\" the researchers wrote. \"In the absence of a clear catalyst, there is little urgency to step in.\"\n\nThe firm noted that traders remain focused on deleveraging and unwinding their positions rather than on preparing for a typical snapback rally.\n\nPressure on digital assets reflected the broader fragility across the crypto market. Aside from a brief bounce last month, bitcoin has struggled since October, when whale selling and forced liquidations swept through the industry.",

    "description": "Google's Q4 earnings focus on AI spending, Cloud gains, and a major Apple deal. Wall Street eyes search dominance amid AI competition.",
    "fullText": "Google has been on a monumental tear as of late. Can it keep the good times rolling?\n\nWhen Alphabet reports its fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, investors will focus on AI spending, cloud wins, and a big Apple deal.\n\nWith Meta projecting its capex for this year to nearly double that of 2025, how high will Google go? The company said in October that it expected capex for 2025 to land between $91 and $93 billion. Investors will track if it sticks to those goals. Google's finance chief, Anat Ashkenazi, also said the company expected a \"significant\" increase in that number for 2026 and promised we'd hear more on Google's Q4 call this week.\n\nAs my colleague Joe Ciolli has observed this earnings season, investors are more willing to forgive big capital spending on AI as long as fundamentals remain chugging along.\n\nThat leads to the question of how Google's search advertising business, its core engine, is doing. Are OpenAI and other AI rivals chipping away at its dominance, or is Alphabet's money-printing machine whirring as proudly as ever?\n\nAnalysts at Bernstein appeared optimistic in a note this week, writing that they expect Google to have seen an increase in query volume in Q4.\n\n\"For Tinuiti's advertisers, Google's US paid click growth was the highest it has been since early 2021,\" Bernstein analysts wrote, referring to the US marketing agency.\n\nGoogle's cloud business has also become top billing, as it furiously competes with Amazon and Microsoft to build infrastructure and win crucial AI deals. In Q3, Google said the number of new cloud customers increased by about 34% year over year.\n\nBernstein analysts predicted big business for cloud off the back of AI sales, its big Anthropic deal, and the ramp-up of its AI chip business, known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).\n\n\"We also note that the new deal between Anthropic and Google for 'tens of billions of dollars' worth of compute represents upside to Google Cloud growth, regardless of whether the money flows through Cloud deals or outright TPU sales,\" they wrote.\n\nSpeaking of deals, this marks the first earnings report since Google and Apple announced that the iPhone giant will use Google's Gemini AI models for its revamped Siri assistant.\n\nThere are still a lot of unanswered questions there. How much does Google get out of the deal? Can Google use query data to train Gemini? Will Apple use Google's data centers and TPU chips?\n\nHopefully, we'll get a clearer picture of the inner workings of that deal on Wednesday's earnings call.",

    "description": "Florida football defensive tackle Caleb Banks lands with the Chargers in ESPN's latest NFL mock draft after a strong Senior Bowl showing.",
    "fullText": "Former Florida football defensive tackle Caleb Banks is projected to be selected by the Los Angeles Chargers with the No. 22 pick, according to ESPN's latest 2026 NFL mock draft.\n\nAccording to analyst Matt Miller, his reasoning is pretty straightforward: the Chargers need more of a true anchor on the defensive line, and Banks fits the mold as a nose tackle who can hold ground against the run while still bringing some juice as a power rusher.\n\nBanks is listed at 6-feet-6-inches and 339 pounds, and Miller describes him as an \"aggressive bull rusher\" with rare first-step quickness for a guy built like that.\n\nBanks' most recent season with the Gators didn't look normal on paper because he was limited to two games due to a foot injury. That's the type of thing that can quietly stall a prospect's momentum, especially when draft cycles move as fast as they do. But that's also where the Senior Bowl comes in.\n\nHis week in Mobile, Alabama, was well-received by scouts, and it sounds like the practices helped reintroduce him as a disruptor instead of \"the injured guy who missed time.\"\n\nBanks still has plenty of runway left in the pre-draft process, and his medicals and testing will matter a ton. But getting slotted in the first round, even in a mock, is the kind of headline that sticks. It puts Banks firmly in the \"name to know\" tier as draft talk heats up.\n\n\"The run on edge rushers before this pick leaves the Chargers with some interesting decisions. Do they add to an offensive line that was marred by injury in 2025 or try to fix a D-line that still needs a true anchor to help defend the run?\n\n\"With the talent that's left on the board, Banks would be very enticing as the nose tackle Los Angeles is missing. The 6-foot-6, 339-pounder is an aggressive bull rusher with rare first-step quickness for his size. Think Vita Vea, but with better length. Banks missed all but two games last season due to a foot injury, but his Senior Bowl performance was well-received by scouts, who saw the explosive play in the trenches that excited them entering the 2025 season.\"\n\nFollow us@GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well asBluesky, and like our page onFacebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nIf you purchase through our links, the USA Today Network may earn a commission.

    "description": "Palantir's stock has been stuck in low gear since late last year, but its latest blockbuster results have stunned Wall Street analysts this week.",
    "fullText": "It's been a rough few months for Palantir, but the AI software company looks like it's getting its groove back.\n\nExhibit A is the big stock surge Palantir saw on Tuesday, with shares popping as much as 12% as investors cheered its best quarter ever. Revenue came in at a record $1.4 billion, a 70% increase from the prior year. It also gave strong guidance for 2026, predicting $7.18 billion in revenue, ahead of expectations of $6.2 billion.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC on Monday, CEO Alex Karp said he believed the firm's financials marked \"the best results\" he was aware of in the tech sector over the last 10 years.\n\nIt's the kind of good news Palantir investors have been waiting for. The stock has been in the doldrums, sliding at the end of 2025 as the company attracted interest from short sellers and faced institutional selling pressure amid concerns about bloated tech valuations.\n\nWhile the stock is still up nearly 100% in the last year, shares were down 28% from their peak in early November through Monday, before the company reported earnings.\n\nAnd Wall Street has been floored by the latest results.\n\nPalantir's earnings mark the 10th straight quarter that revenue has accelerated, Morgan Stanley said on Tuesday. The bank lifted its revenue forecast for the stock for the next two years and reiterated its price target of $205, implying about 30% upside from the stock's current levels.\n\n\"PLTR is on course to reach $10B in revenue at the fastest growth rate and highest margins perhaps in sw history, underscoring its status as a clear AI winner,\" analysts wrote.\n\nBank of America concurred, reiterating its \"buy\" rating and $255 price target on the stock. Palantir's earnings could be a warning to other firms in the AI space that artificial intelligence endeavours need \"to come with real results,\" the analysts said.\n\n\"While the market's relationship with AI companies continues to be volatile, we see these results cementing PLTR's place as one which will survive and thrive in the chaos,\" BofA wrote.\n\nTruist called Palantir a \"Conclusive AI Pure-Play Victor\" in a note after the earnings.\n\n\"We view this momentum as further evidence PLTR is enabling AI adoption at scale for its customers, leading to discernible results,\" analysts wrote, adding that strong growth in Palantir's backlog gave them confidence about the firm's long-term trajectory.\n\nThe firm also reiterated its \"buy\" rating on Palantir and $223 price target, implying 39% upside from current levels.\n\nWedbush Securities' Dan Ives said Palantir's fourth-quarter results ended \"Another Robust Year from Messi of AI.\"\n\n\"Palantir is helping lead the AI Revolution into the use case phase as its AIP product moat is unmatched in our view,\" he said in a note. The firm called Palantir one of its top tech stocks to own in 2026 and reiterated its \"outperform\" rating and $230 price target, implying 44% upside.\n\nSome on Wall Street still see risks ahead for the AI darling, given Palantir's lofty valuation. Analysts at Jefferies said they saw potential downside given the stock's elevated forward earnings multiple.\n\n\"We view execution as strong, though at 39x CY27E rev, multiple downside outweighs fundamental upside, with more attractive stocks in our coverage,\" analysts wrote, reiterating their \"underperform rating\" and $70 price target, a drop of 56% from current levels.",

    "fullText": "CEO Alex Karp hails ‘iconic’ financial results despite criticism over contracts with ICE and homeland security\n\nPalantir celebrated its latest financial results on Monday, as the tech company blew past Wall Street expectations and continues to prop up the Trump administration’s push to deport immigrants.\n\nPalantir has secured millions of dollars in federal contracts amid Trump’s crackdown on immigrants. The multibillion-dollar Denver-based firm creates tech focused on surveillance and analytics, to be used by the government agencies and private companies.\n\nPalantir’s biggest US customer is the Department of Defense; it also works with the Department of Homeland Security, and the majority of its revenue comes from deals with the federal government. Palantir reported 66% year-over-year growth in revenue from government contracts, to $570m.\n\nPalantir has drawn further criticism over its role in the government’s immigration agenda, since federal immigration officers killed two protesters in Minneapolis last month.\n\nPalantir chief executive Alex Karp told CNBC in an interview Monday that Palantir helps protect sensitive data. “If you are critical of ICE, you should be out there protesting for more Palantir,” he said. “Our product, actually, in its core, requires people to conform with fourth amendment data protection.”\n\nThe company beat Wall Street expectations of $1.33bn with $1.41bn in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2025. It reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.25 – which also surpassed Wall Street expectations of $0.23 in EPS. The company’s stocks jumped about 8% in after-hours trading after the release.\n\nKarp described the company’s growth on an earnings call as “one of the truly iconic performances in the history of corporate performance”. He wrote in a letter accompanying the earnings report that the $1.4bn in revenue generated in last year’s fourth quarter marks a new record – a 70% growth rate over the same period the year before.\n\n“We did this while supporting, in critical manner, some of the most interesting intricate, unusual, operations that the US government has been involved in – many of which we can’t comment on – but were the highlight of last year and highly motivating to all of us at Palantir,” Karp said.\n\nKarp doubled down on his data protection claim on the call, arguing that Palantir’s work with the US government, including intelligence agencies, aligns with the fourth amendment and makes sure “every institution that uses (Palantir’s) products is doing it within conformity of the law and ethics of America”.\n\nData privacy advocates are not convinced. “Palantir tools are ICE’s digital henchmen,” said Will Owen, communications director at the non-profit, Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, in a statement to the Guardian. “Their revenue may be up thanks to Trump, but no one is buying that they hold ICE accountable.”\n\nLast year, ICE awarded Palantir a nearly $30m contract to build ImmigrationOS, which makes it easier to pull information about immigrants from across government databases – regardless of the accuracy of those records. 404 Media recently reported on the existence of another tool created by Palantir for the federal government: Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement (Elite).\n\nElite “populates a map with potential deportation targets, brings up a dossier on each person, and provides a ‘confidence score’ on the person’s current address”, according to 404 Media. The program reportedly relies on address data from the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes Medicaid.\n\nWired reported last week that the federal government has been using Palantir’s AI tools to process immigration enforcement tips. Wired also reported that the health department has been using other Palantir AI tools to screen grants and job descriptions for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), and “gender ideology”.\n\nPalantir has said there is no malicious intent in its work with the federal government.\n\n“To be absolutely clear, Palantir is not working on any master database project to unify databases across federal agencies,” read a company blogpost last week. “Palantir has not proposed the US government build a ‘master list’ for the surveillance of citizens, nor have we been asked to consider building such a system for any customer.”\n\nPalantir has described 404 Media’s claims about the Elite tool as misleading; the company says it is “used for prioritized enforcement to surface the likely addresses of specific individuals, such as those with final orders of removal or with high severity criminal charges”.\n\nTrump’s “big, beautiful bill” awarded DHS and ICE huge budgets to pursue the administration’s anti-immigrant policies, including $45bn for ICE to expand its detention capabilities.\n\nIn 2025, Palantir’s federal contracts almost doubled – and increased to more than $970m; this amount was distributed across the government, mostly to the defense department, but it also includes the DHS.",

    "fullText": "A newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch delivered a sharp warning to President Donald Trump after a high-profile Republican loss.\n\nIn a new editorial, The Wall Street Journal warned Trump that a hardline immigration strategy promoted by top aide Stephen Miller is fueling voter backlash.\n\nIt comes after a Trump-endorsed candidate for the Texas state senate lost to a Democrat over the weekend.\n\n“How does a Republican lose by 14 points in a safe conservative Texas state Senate seat that President Trump carried by 17 points in 2024? Answer: When there’s a voter backlash against the Trump Administration, notably its mass deportation debacles,” the Journal wrote, describing the special election in Tarrant County.\n\nDemocrat Taylor Rehmet, a labor union leader and veteran, easily defeated Republican Leigh Wambsganss, who had Trump’s endorsement on Truth Social and vastly outspent her opponent.\n\nRehment is the first Democrat to hold the seat in decades.\n\nThe paper noted the timing was disastrous for Republicans, coming after the high-profile Minneapolis killings by federal immigration agents. “The 31-point vote swing in a little more than 14 months can only be explained as part of a rising tide of opposition to Mr. Trump’s first year and a sour public mood,” the Journal observed.\n\nThe White House has faced mounting national backlash after federal immigration agents fatally shot two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis—Renee Good in early January and Alex Pretti later that month—as part of aggressive enforcement operations in the state.\n\nBoth cases sparked controversy over conflicting official narratives. In Pretti’s case, Homeland Security officials and White House aides initially claimed he approached agents with a gun and posed a threat, while bystander videos show him holding only a cellphone before being pinned down and shot.\n\nSimilarly, authorities initially suggested that Good tried to ram agents with her vehicle before she was fatally shot, a claim contradicted by eyewitness footage and reporting. Critics argue these early statements painted both victims as dangerous to justify the shootings, fueling accusations that the administration misrepresented the events.\n\nThe killings came after Trump deployed thousands of federal immigration agents to Minneapolis as part of an aggressive immigration strategy masterminded by Miller.\n\nMiller’s immigration strategy under Trump has pushed aggressive mass arrests and deportations, with ICE agents pressured to meet high daily quotas, even targeting non-criminal undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal critiqued Miller’s hardline tactics, including a daily quota of 3,000 migrant arrests that it says “was bound to result in agent intrusions into homes and businesses.”\n\nWhile immigration has historically been a winning issue for Republicans, the Journal cautioned that enforcement “that turns ugly in the streets is turning off the swing voters who will determine who wins the race for Congress this year.”\n\nPolls have recently shown Americans turning on Trump and his immigration strategy ahead of the 2026 Midterms. A YouGov poll conducted on January 25 showed that about half (48 percent) of respondents do not think the shooting of Pretti in Minneapolis was justified.\n\nAnother YouGov poll showed that 52 percent of Americans think the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict immigration to the U.S. have gone too far.\n\nAs a result, the paper concluded that even as Trump signals a desire to “dial back the confrontations on the street,” he must also reconsider Miller’s influence. “The Miller strategy isn’t likely to fare better this year,” the editorial warned.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal is not the first Murdoch-owned newspaper to publicly condemn Trump’s immigration strategy.\n\nIn an op-ed published last week, the New York Post argued that the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement in Minneapolis is backfiring politically.\n\n“These enforcement tactics won’t turn the tide, instead they are backfiring,” the Post wrote.",

    "description": "A bifurcated picture of tech earnings is emerging during this season of quarterly reports.",
    "fullText": "Big Tech's post-earnings stock performance diverged this week, with clear winners and laggards emerging as Wall Street looks for clear signs of returns on AI investments to determine market leaders.\n\nMeta stock (META) jumped over 10% in one day as investors cheered productivity gains and the integration of AI across the company’s social media apps, advertising and shopping tools, and internal workflows.\n\nWhy did Big Tech earnings performance diverge this week?\n\nWhat's driving the memory and storage demand surge?\n\nHow are AI investments affecting software company valuations?\n\nWhich sectors are outperforming tech stocks currently?\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla (TSLA) shares rebounded on Friday after selling off as investors weighed a massive spending forecast after Elon Musk underscored the company's transition from an electric vehicle maker to autonomous driving and robotics.\n\nAnd tech giant Microsoft's stock (MSFT) was hammered following its results amid concerns over slowing cloud growth and massive AI-related spending. Shares in cloud software leaders Salesforce (CRM) and ServiceNow (NOW) also tumbled on worries that AI could disrupt the software-as-a-service model.\n\n“It comes down to monetization. That’s what the Street wants to see here,” Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance on Friday.\n\n\"I think what you're seeing is really a bifurcation in tech. It's kind of the haves and the have nots, and that's really what's playing out across tech earnings,\" he added.\n\nThe market has been wary of an AI bubble in recent quarters and wants to see that companies' billions of dollars in investments in the technology are paying off in their results.\n\n\"Investors are voting with their feet, and they're going into sectors where the growth is more obvious to see and they feel like there is durability,\" said Wolfe Research managing director and head of software research Alex Zukin.\n\nStill, Wall Street views the recent sell-off in software stocks as overdone, arguing that the benefits of AI will take longer to materialize.\n\n\"There's a lot more complexity associated with enterprise, data, governance, security, compliance, risk, and we think that some of these trends and themes can play out over a longer period of time,\" he said, adding, \"We're still in phase zero of adoption.\"\n\nThe analyst sees buying opportunities in data platform companies such as MongoDB (MDB), data warehouse providers like Snowflake (SNOW), observability vendors such as Datadog (DDOG), and communications platform companies like Twilio (TWLO), all of which have declined in sympathy with broader weakness across software stocks.\n\nOne clear theme is on track — strong demand for memory and storage for AI.",

(NASDAQ:PLTR) ahead of its fiscal Q4 2025 results, expected to be announced on February 2.\n\n​Recently, on January 27, Mariana Perez Mora from Bank of America Securities reiterated a Buy rating on the stock without disclosing any price targets. However, earlier, on January 26, Rishi Jaluria from RBC Capital reiterated a Sell Rating on the stock with a $50 price target.\n\nManagement expects Q4 2025 revenue to be in the range of $1.327 billion and $1.331 billion, with income from operations around $695 million to $699 million. Wall Street expects revenue around $1.34 billion, along with a GAAP EPS of $0.18.\n\n​Analysts at RBC Capital noted that the conservative outlook on Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) is based on the government data tracker, which suggests a decline in qualified contract value and also a decline in annual contract value. However, RBC capital acknowledged that the uncertainty in geopolitics is anticipated to add long-term demand for the company. Moreover, the firm also highlighted that after talking with some customers of Palantir, they find customers reassessing their contracts with the company or moving away from the solutions. Overall, RBC Capital finds the company’s risk/reward situation inclined towards the negative side, hence a Sell rating.\n\n​Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) builds and deploys software platforms for the intelligence community to help in counterterrorism investigations and operations.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of PLTR as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

    "description": "Jordan Blake Banks, an American who moved to Finland, said the pay is lower but healthcare education, and childcare are much more accessible.",
    "fullText": "This is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with Jordan Blake Banks, an American and Finnish citizen who moved to Finland in 2019 for school and stayed to work. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was born and raised in St. Louis, then moved to Urbana-Champaign to study my bachelor's in agricultural and biological engineering at the University of Illinois. I graduated in May 2019 and moved to Finland about a month and a half later.\n\nI studied abroad in Spain, and really loved it there. It opened my world and gave me more perspective, so I knew I wanted to go abroad after I graduated. I was interested in bioenergy, and that industry isn't very developed in the US. After doing some research, I landed on Finland, which has a huge forestry and bioenergy industry. The Nordics, in general, also have a lot of English-language master's degree programs. Through a Fulbright scholarship, I moved to Finland to pursue my master's degree.\n\nI basically moved from one university environment to another, so in that sense, it was pretty similar. During my second year, I completed a research traineeship while I worked in a lab and wrote my thesis. After school, I eventually got a job in sustainability consulting at Deloitte, one of the Big Four consulting firms.\n\nIn Finland, you will most likely get a much lower salary than what you would make in the United States, but at least in my experience, it has balanced out. A lot of the things that are more expensive in the United States, like health insurance, education, and childcare, cost way less in Finland.\n\nFinland has a really good work-life balance in general. There isn't a huge culture of grinding, staying up late, and working long hours to get ahead in your career. The general idea is that the company and your colleagues respect you as a person and your personal time.\n\nIt's very common for people to set clear boundaries around work. A parent might leave in the middle of the day to take care of their child or have strict start and stop times because of family responsibilities. I really don't think that's seen as anything bad in Finland. Most people also take a month of holiday in the summer and time off in the winter. Even in consulting, the expectation to constantly work overtime just isn't the norm.\n\nFinnish is a very different language and probably the biggest challenge. Even though many international companies operate in English, in consulting, some projects are done in Finnish, and colleagues who speak the language are more likely to get those assignments.\n\nI eventually participated in an integration program where I spent months learning Finnish full-time. That experience really accelerated my language learning. Learning the language helped me feel more integrated in everyday life. I also don't think I would have passed the national Finnish language exam without it, which I took to become a citizen after meeting and marrying my wife here.\n\nOne of the biggest pluses is that I feel very safe here as a woman. Walking alone at night is something I would probably be very anxious about in many places in the United States, but in Finland, I feel pretty comfortable.\n\nAs a Black American living in a small Finnish town, that can be a shock if you're not used to it. In the smaller university town where I started, I did feel maybe a little bit more othered, but since moving to Helsinki, I noticed there was a lot more diversity.\n\nThere are also all of these different Facebook groups like \"Americans in Finland\" or \"Americans in Helsinki.\" I think it's actually pretty easy to connect if you're looking for a specific cultural group.\n\nPeople in Finland are not as open initially. In the US, it's very common to make eye contact, smile, or say hi to people you pass on the street. In Finland, it can feel like people are actively avoiding contact. I've heard many stories of people about to leave their apartment who hear their neighbor open their door to also leave, so they rush back inside so they don't have to make contact with anyone.\n\nThat can be a shock at first. At the same time, once you do get to know people, you can make good connections and real friendships. You just have to be willing to put yourself out there and be the brave American who asks for what you want.\n\nYou can also use it to your advantage, and I think it helped me land my first paid research job at the university. I was willing to make contact and be the \"brave American\" who asks for things.\n\nDo you have a story to share about moving abroad? Contact this reporter at kvlamis@businessinsider.com.",
