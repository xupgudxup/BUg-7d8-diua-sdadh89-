    "description": "Appetite for loans tied to Oracle's data center partnership with OpenAI has diminished, reflecting concerns over credit risk and AI investment scale.",
    "fullText": "Oracle and OpenAI have aimed to build $500 billion of data centers by the end of the decade to power their artificial intelligence ambitions.\n\nBut the massive initiative, called Stargate, may be exhausting the supply of available capital.\n\nJPMorgan Chase, the bank that recently led a pack of lenders to extend roughly $38 billion of debt for the construction of two planned Stargate data center campuses in Texas and Wisconsin, has encountered diminished interest as it has sold off pieces of the loan to other financial players, a person familiar with the situation said.\n\nThe person said that the two projects are fully financed, the syndication effort by JPMorgan had been successful overall, and that the slowdown in new participants hadn't alarmed bankers given that it was at the tail end of such a large debt offering.\n\nBut the person acknowledged that banks and institutional investors had also grown wary in recent months of taking on too much exposure to Oracle, a tech giant whose credit rating sits below some of its peers in the AI race, including Microsoft and Google.\n\nThe reticence among lenders and investors to continue bankrolling Stargate raises questions about whether the mega-project will meet its lofty objectives.\n\n\"We are hearing from market participants that in some cases, there may be banks that could be approaching the exposure levels they're comfortable with when it comes to certain data center projects,\" said Dhaval Shah, a director at S&P Global Infrastructure Ratings.\n\nThe current unprecedented data center development cycle has been dominated by just a handful of leading players, testing whether lenders and investors will remain willing to continue to accrue heavy exposure to borrowers like Oracle. Oracle declined to comment.\n\nIn November, credit default swaps that insure against losses on Oracle's corporate debt rose in cost, a reflection of the concerns around the company's enormous spending on AI.\n\nOpenAI, the AI chatbot maker that will anchor the Stargate facilities, meanwhile, produces revenue that is just a fraction of the tens of billions of dollars annually that would be necessary to justify the cost of its infrastructure.\n\n\"Oracle has become a proxy for OpenAI's ability to raise significant amounts of capital,\" said Gil Luria, an analyst at DA Davidson. \"It's a very precarious position.\"\n\nOpenAI announced Stargate a year ago, stating that it would partner with Oracle and others, to build a total of 10 gigawatts of data center capacity by 2029 — roughly the equivalent power footprint of New York City on a day of peak electrical consumption.\n\nIn October, OpenAI announced that it had arranged for the construction of six Stargate sites with a total planned capacity of roughly 7 gigawatts, stating that the pipeline \"puts us on a clear path to securing the full $500 billion,10-gigawatt commitment\" it had announced at the beginning of 2025.\n\nMuch of the financing for the project, so far, has been provided by major financial institutions that have banded together to share its immense costs — as well as its risks — in what are known as syndication deals. JPMorgan Chase and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group led the syndication effort for the two Stargate projects in Shackelford, Texas, and Port Washington, Wisconsin. Both banks declined to comment.\n\nBank of America is leading a syndication to finance another Stargate data center campus in Michigan. A person familiar with that effort said that it has attracted interest from syndication takers.\n\nAnother group of lenders provided about $18 billion of financing for another Stargate facility in New Mexico, according to Bloomberg.\n\nInitial players in large syndication deals often seek to sell off portions of their loan commitments to other players, including other banks and institutional investors.\n\nBut the sale of these positions, which is done to reap quick profits and lower exposure, has become trickier in the case of Stargate.\n\nTwo bankers and a financing executive who are familiar with the syndication market said that the rising perception of risk around Stargate meant that lenders now wanted higher yields to lend to it. That has placed recent Stargate syndicators in a position where they can no longer profitably sell off debt that was arranged at tighter spreads just a few months ago.\n\nStargate borrowing rates may not come down any time soon.\n\nIn September, S&P Global Ratings affirmed Oracle's rating at BBB but said it was considering a cut due to the company's enormous planned spending on AI infrastructure. A downgrade below BBB minus would place a junk rating on Oracle debt, raising its borrowing costs significantly.\n\n\"I am very surprised these loans were even underwritten at the time,\" Luria said. \"The market has indicated this is not investment-grade debt.\"\n\nHowever, Luria said one scenario in particular could make the loans less risky. OpenAI is now in the process of trying to raise as much as $100 billion, according to reports, giving the Stargate venture a potential cushion of equity and making its debt easier to sell, he said.\n\n\"If that happens,\" he said, \"everybody's dreams come true.\"\n\nOther bankers who spoke with Business Insider said the slowdown did not indicate acute trouble in the syndication market, but acknowledged that the pool of investors who still have an appetite for the Stargate debt has shrunk.\n\n\"Do we have enough digestive capacity\" in the market for investors to buy all of the debt that will be required, said David Tawil, a partner at transaction insurance advisory firm Castle Harbour. \"That's the market's real concern: the size of this whole movement.\"",

    "description": "Can it become the next biotech leader?",
    "fullText": "Viking Therapeutics' price target implies a juicy upside from its current levels.\n\nThe stock's most important catalysts will likely have to wait until next year.\n\nThe drugmaker is somewhat risky, but it could deliver massive returns.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Viking Therapeutics ›\n\nLast year was a challenging one for Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX), a mid-cap biotech. The company made little clinical progress and, in fact, one of the major data readouts it released was not well received by the market, leading to a sell-off. Over the trailing 12-month period, Viking Therapeutics' shares have lagged the S&P 500. But could Viking perform much better this year?\n\nPlenty of analysts on Wall Street think so. The company boasts an average price target of $93.39 (according to Yahoo! Finance), implying an upside of 175% from its current levels. Can Viking Therapeutics soar by that much in 2026?\n\nViking Therapeutics' leading candidate is VK2735, an investigational GLP-1 medicine it is developing for weight management. A subcutaneous version of this therapy is currently in a 78-week phase 3 study. Viking's phase 3 results for VK2735 will be the most significant event for the company in a long time, potentially leading to its share price soaring overnight, provided the results are strong.\n\nHowever, considering the trial completed enrollment in late 2025, we are unlikely to see full results anytime soon. The biotech will likely reveal those in 2027. Could we see an interim analysis in 2026? Maybe, but it's not clear. Viking Therapeutics is also running a phase 1 maintenance study for VK2735, testing daily oral, weekly oral, and monthly injection regimens in a small number of patients who have already achieved weight loss with VK2735.\n\nWhy is this important? Losing weight and keeping it off are two different things. Many GLP-1 patients regain much of what they lose, and drugmakers are increasingly developing strategies to help with that. If Viking can show that continuing VK2735, in a different formulation (oral) or at different intervals (monthly versus weekly), can help keep the weight off, that would be an interesting differentiator for the medicine.\n\nIt would take a lot for Viking Therapeutics' shares to jump by 175% this year. The maintenance study is unlikely to get it there, since phase 1 studies tend to prioritize safety and tolerability (things that won't significantly jolt the stock price even if they are strong) over efficacy. So, even if this maintenance study goes well, it won't help Viking's shares more than double this year.",

    "fullText": "In the third quarter, hedge fund billionaires Philippe Laffont and Steven Schonfeld sold Amazon stock and added to their positions in the iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\nWall Street expects Amazon’s earnings to grow at 19% annually over the next three years, which makes the current valuation of 34 times earnings look fair.\n\nMore companies and institutional investors are buying Bitcoin (or spot Bitcoin ETFs), and that is likely to continue because it is the more popular and most liquid cryptocurrency.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nIn the third quarter, two hedge fund billionaires sold Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and added to positions in the iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) managed by BlackRock that tracks the spot price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC).\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management sold 1.4 million shares of Amazon, trimming the position 14%. He also purchased 76,100 shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust, more than doubling his stake.\n\nSteven Schonfeld of Schonfeld Strategic Advisors sold 253,700 shares of Amazon, reducing the position 72%. He also added 1.1 million shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust, increasing his stake 20%.\n\nThe trades are noteworthy because Laffont and Schonfeld outperformed the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) by 94 percentage points and 22 percentage points, respectively, in the last three years. That makes both hedge fund managers good sources of inspiration.\n\nSeveral Wall Street analysts expect Bitcoin to be far more valuable in the future. Tom Lee at Fundstrat Global Advisors says its price could hit $3 trillion in the long run, which implies more than 3,000% upside from where it currently trades at $95,000. Michael Saylor of Strategy says its price could hit $13 million by 2045, implying more than 13,500% upside.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nAmazon has a strong presence in e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing. Building on that advantage, the company has integrated artificial intelligence (AI) products and features across all three business segments to drive revenue growth and improve profit margins.\n\nIn e-commerce, Amazon has developed hundreds of generative AI applications to improve operational efficiency. They automate customer service, optimize demand forecasting, improve inventory placement, and expedite last-mile delivery. Amazon has also developed an AI model called DeepFleet that helps robots navigate warehouses more quickly.\n\nIn cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has launched new foundational models and services, such as Bedrock for generative AI application development. AWS has also introduced AI agents for coding, security, and incident monitoring, and a business intelligence platform called Quick Suite, which leans on generative AI to analyze data, surface insights, and automate workflows.",

    "title": "Vinod Khosla is looking at this metric to gauge if we're in an AI bubble",
    "description": "\"What Wall Street tends to do with it, I don't really care,\" Khosla said.",
    "fullText": "Vinod Khosla has his eye on one AI metric, and it's not stock prices.\n\nOn an episode of OpenAI's podcast released on Monday, the famed venture capitalist shared how he's gauging whether we're in an AI bubble — or not.\n\n\"People equate bubble to stock prices, which has nothing to do with anything other than fear and greed among investors,\" he said. \"So I always look at, bubbles should be measured by the number of API calls.\"\n\nAPI, or Application Programming Interface calls, refer to the process in which one software application sends a message to another application to request data or to trigger an action. They are a common indicator of digital tools' use, especially with the rise of AI agents. High API calls can also be a mark of a poor or inefficient product.\n\nKhosla said the bubble shouldn't be called \"by what happened to stock prices because somebody got overexcited or underexcited and in one day they can go from loving Nvidia to hating Nvidia because it's overvalued.\"\n\nThe 70-year-old VC, whose notable investments include OpenAI, DoorDash, and Block, compared the AI bubble to the dot-com bubble. He said he looked out for internet traffic as a metric during the 1990s, and with AI bubble concerns, that benchmark is now API calls.\n\n\"If that's your fundamental metric of what's the real use of your AI, usefulness of AI, demand for AI, you're not going to see a bubble in API calls,\" he said. \"What Wall Street tends to do with it, I don't really care. I think it's mostly irrelevant.\"\n\nConcerns that the AI industry is overvalued because of massive investments became one of the buzziest themes in the second half of 2025. The phrase \"AI bubble\" appeared in 42 earnings calls and investor conference transcripts between October and December — a 740% increase from the previous quarter, according to an AlphaSense analysis.\n\nTop business leaders remain split about whether the bubble is about to burst.\n\nMicrosoft cofounder Bill Gates said AI has extremely high value, but it's still in a bubble.\n\n\"But you have a frenzy,\" Gates told CNBC in late October. \"And some of these companies will be glad they spent all this money. Some of them, you know, they'll commit to data centers whose electricity is too expensive.\"\n\nEarlier this month, \"Big Short\" investor Michael Burry raised the alarm on an AI bubble in a Substack exchange.\n\nBurry wrote that companies, including Microsoft and Alphabet, are wasting trillions on microchips and data centers that will quickly become obsolete. He added that their spending has \"no clear path to utilization by the real economy.\"\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has dismissed concerns of a bubble. His company became the world's first $5 trillion market cap company in October on the back of the AI boom.\n\nIn an October Bloomberg TV appearance, Huang said that instead of overspeculation, AI is part of a transition from an old way of computing.\n\n\"We also know that AI has become good enough because of reasoning capability, and research capability, its ability to think — it's now generating tokens and intelligence that is worth paying for,\" Huang said.",

    "title": "Wall Street's $7.8 Trillion Warning Has Reached a Deafening Tone -- but Are Investors Paying Attention?",
    "description": "The actions of investors speak louder than words, pointing to growing skepticism about the current bull-market rally.",
    "fullText": "The third year of Wall Street's bull market rally delivered for investors, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite, respectively, rising by double digits.\n\nInvestors are opting for ultra-safe assets, potentially throwing cold water on a red-hot but expensive stock market.\n\nHistorical trends continue to favor long-term, optimistic investors.\n\n10 stocks we like better than S&P 500 Index ›\n\nThe third year of Wall Street's bull market rally didn't disappoint investors. When the closing bell tolled for 2025, the mature stock-driven Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), benchmark S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and growth-propelled Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) had risen by 13%, 16%, and 20%, respectively. It marked only the third time in the nearly century-long history of the S&P 500 that it's gained at least 15% for three consecutive years.\n\nWhile long-term appreciation for Wall Street's major stock indexes has become the expectation for investors, short-term directional movements aren't as consistently predictable. When things seem almost too good to be true for the stock market, this often turns out to be the case.\n\nNewly released data from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve points to a $7.8 trillion (and growing) warning for Wall Street that's reached a deafening tone. The only question is: Are investors paying attention?\n\nAt any given time, there are one or more headwinds that threaten to upend the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite. Though there's no way to predict short-term directional moves on Wall Street with guaranteed accuracy, select data points and correlated events do have exceptional track records of forecasting the future.\n\nOne such data point, which is reported quarterly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, should give professional and everyday investors alike reason for pause.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2025, the total financial assets held in money market funds rose to an all-time high of $7.774 trillion. Money market funds are a type of mutual fund that invests in ultra-safe, higher-quality assets, such as short-term Treasury bills, municipal bonds, corporate debt, and certificates of deposit.\n\nMoney market funds are primarily designed for stability and income but are dependent on fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Higher interest rates yield more income, while rate-easing cycles (like the one we're in now) reduce interest-earning potential.",

    "fullText": "Investor enthusiasm over the prospects of artificial intelligence are expected to drive Big Tech stocks in particular this year — but Wall Street also expects gains in other sectors.\n\nOver the past two weeks, Industrials (XLI), Materials (XLB), Energy (XLE), and Consumer Staples (XLP) have outperformed the broader market, with all of those sectors up 5.5% or more.\n\nEven the small-cap Russell 2000 (^RUT) index has risen 8% since the start of the year, outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC), which is up more than 1% during the same period.\n\n\"It's a broadening playbook,\" Oppenheimer chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus told Yahoo Finance on Friday.\n\nStoltzfus' price target for the S&P 500 this year is the most bullish on Wall Street at 8,100, with other analysts expecting double-digit percentage gains taking the benchmark index toward 7,500 or 7,600.\n\n\"What we're seeing is a rotation, and it's not necessarily away from technology, as we would think,\" he added. \"It's some profit taking to broaden one's exposure and diversification.\"\n\nKeith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services, agrees. His firm's strategy has been to go Overweight on industrials, while also upgrading healthcare and energy stocks.\n\n\"I wouldn't get rid of the tech at this point. I think there are more opportunities beyond tech, is the way I would think about it,\" Lerner said.\n\nStrategists are optimistic given what they've seen with earnings, which kicked off last week.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) showed one of the strongest years for the investment banking business since the pandemic, sending shares of those firms higher.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s (TSM) strong results also gave a lift to semiconductor stocks and fueled optimism that the AI cycle is only accelerating\n\nShares of memory chipmaker Micron (MU) and equipment makers ASML (ASML) and Applied Materials (AMAT) are all up at least 25% year-to-date.\n\nPerformance in the AI chip space so far underscores that artificial intelligence and tech are expected to lead the market again this year as wider adoption across enterprises takes hold.\n\n\"As we wait for that to unfold, I think tech, especially big tech and AI as a theme, is the core of this market,\" Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna said. \"Our core conviction is that it'll sustain this year, even though the level of scrutiny around that [AI] has decidedly increased.\"\n\nThe test will be whether software stocks, facing disruption from artificial intelligence, can find their footing. Names like Microsoft (MSFT), Salesforce (CRM), and ServiceNow (NOW) have all fallen since the start of the year as investors weigh AI's impact.",

    "description": "Despite midterm elections in November, Wall Street expects the S&P 500 to deliver double-digit returns over the next year.",
    "fullText": "The S&P 500 has usually performs poorly during midterm election years, declining by an average 18% at some point before November.\n\nThe stock market usually performs well after midterm elections (as policy uncertainty dissipates), returning an average of 14% during the next six months.\n\nWall Street's consensus estimate puts the S&P 500 at 8,085 by January 2027, which implies more than 16% upside from its current level of 6,940.\n\n10 stocks we like better than S&P 500 Index ›\n\nThe S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), the most popular benchmark for the U.S. stock market, has delivered double-digit returns in three consecutive years. Wall Street expects the index to extend its streak in 2026, but midterm election years typically involve sharp declines.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nThe S&P 500 has consistently performed poorly during midterm election years since it was created in 1957. Here are two facts investors should know.\n\nThe S&P 500 has returned an average of 1% during midterm election years, but the index has declined by an average of 7% during those years when a new president sits in the White House.\n\nThe S&P 500 has suffered an average intra-year drawdown of 18% during midterm election years, meaning history says the index will drop 18% at some point in 2026.\n\nWhat explains that trend? Midterm elections create uncertainty, especially because the political party in power tends to lose seats in Congress. Investors are unsure where to put money because they are unsure whether the president will retain enough congressional votes to maintain the status quo. Uncertainty is poison to the stock market.\n\nHowever, policy uncertainty dissipates quickly after the midterm election results are finalized, and the stock market tends to deliver strong returns. In fact, Carson Research says the six-month period following a midterm election (i.e., November through April) is the strongest of the four-year presidential cycle. The S&P 500 has added an average of 14% in those six months.\n\nDoes that mean you should sell your stocks today and buy them back in November? Nope. Attempts to time the market often backfire. Famous fund manager Peter Lynch once said, \"Far more money has been lost by investors trying to anticipate corrections, or trying to time the market, than has been lost in corrections themselves.\"\n\nIndeed, the S&P 500 has done quite well during some midterm election years. The index's return has ranged from up 38% to down 30%, and its largest intra-year decline has ranged from 4% to 38%. Most Wall Street analysts expect 2026 to be one of the better midterm election years.",

    "description": "Bitcoin likely already reached its post-halving peak at $126,000 last year, Jefferies' global head of equity strategy wrote in a note.",
    "fullText": "A longtime crypto bull is ditching bitcoin for gold.\n\nChristopher Wood, the global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, said he just cut bitcoin out of his firm's long-term model portfolio, where the token has accounted for around 5%-10% of the portfolio's allocation for the last five years.\n\nThat's because the price of the crypto has likely peaked, but also because there's an existential threat he sees jeopardizing the bitcoin ecosystem: quantum computing.\n\nIn a recent note to clients, Wood pointed specifically to CRQCs, or cryptographically relevant quantum computers — supercomputers that could potentially \"steal\" bitcoin from circulation, he said.\n\nBitcoin transactions are secured with cryptography, a coding system where transactions are encrypted with public keys, and access to the bitcoin itself is controlled by a private key. It would take supercomputers today \"trillions of years\" to derive a private key from a public one, given how complex the computations are, Wood said. But CRQCs could potentially reduce that time to something like several hours to several days, he speculated.\n\nCRQCs don't yet exist, but chatter about the potential risks is already spreading across the bitcoin community, Wood said, pointing to a report from ChainCode Labs that estimated as much as 10 million tokens, or 50% of all bitcoin in circulation, could be accessed by a CRQC.\n\nSome in the crypto community are arguing that the risk from CRQCs means \"vulnerable coins\" in the bitcoin ecosystem should be burned, Wood bited.\n\n\"While GREED & fear does not believe that the quantum issue is about to hit the Bitcoin price dramatically in the near term, the store of value concept is clearly on less solid foundation from the standpoint of a long-term pension portfolio,\" Wood said of his recent portfolio change. He added that he believed bitcoin reached its peak in the post-halving cycle at $126,000 last year.\n\nWood's team has replaced the allocation to bitcoin in the model portfolio with a 10% allocation to gold and gold mining stocks. The portfolio now has a total 45% allocation to physical gold, a 25% allocation to gold mining stocks, and a 30% allocation to Asian equities, excluding Japan.\n\n\"Meanwhile, the existential issue raised by quantum as regards Bitcoin can only be long-term positive for gold since it remains the historically stress tested store of value. Meanwhile, gold is also the best hedge, if not the only one, on the ever-rising geopolitical risks,\" Wood said.\n\nIt's been a rough few months for bitcoin, with the crypto tumbling into a bear market in late 2025 amid a broader risk-off move that was exacerbated by weak liquidity and concerns about the yen-carry trade.\n\nMeanwhile, the case for owning gold has only grown stronger since its stunning rally in 2025. The metal saw its best performance since 1979 and continues to hover near a record high as investors seek protection from geopolitical conflict and inflationary pressures.",

    "title": "Here's what Wall Street bank CEOs are saying about head count in the age of AI",
    "description": "From JPMorgan to Citi, here's what industry leaders at are saying about how AI may impact jobs.",
    "fullText": "As banks reported earnings this week, CEOs dropped more insight into how generative AI could boost productivity, replace some roles, and keep head count from growing.\n\nBanks, many of which became bloated during the frenzied deal boom of the pandemic, have been slimming down their ranks over the last few years. It's becoming clearer that, despite dealmaking making a comeback, executives are signaling they want to do more with fewer people, leaning on AI to boost productivity and absorb additional work.\n\nWe've highlighted some of the most revealing comments from bank CEOs and CFOs on head count and AI.\n\nJamie Dimon has stuck to his trademark bluntness when talking about AI and jobs.\n\n\"It will eliminate jobs,\" Dimon said at a Fortune conference in December. \"People should stop sticking their heads in the sand.\"\n\nIn the near term, Dimon said in an interview with CNN that JPMorgan's head count remains steady, or even rises, as AI continues to roll out — if the bank does a \"good job.\"\n\nThe bigger promise is efficiency. \"It will affect every job,\" Dimon said at a 2024 Alliance Bernstein conference, describing a future where AI handles tasks like note-taking and summarization at the push of a button.\n\nThat efficiency could still mean more hiring in areas like cybersecurity, where Dimon says banks will need AI to counter increasingly sophisticated fraud.\n\nCFO Jeremy Barnum said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call on Tuesday that the bank is allowing for some additional hiring in technology \"at the margin.\"\n\nOn that same call, however, Barnum said that, generally speaking, they \"want to make sure that when someone needs to get something done, whether it's in technology or elsewhere, their first reaction is not, 'Hire more people.'\" \n\nHe has previously said JPMorgan is asking people to \"resist head count growth where possible\" and focus instead on efficiency.\n\nThe head of JPMorgan's consumer business, Marianne Lake, has said operations staff could be 40% to 50% more productive over the next five years — a shift she said would lead to slower net head count growth, as each employee can handle far more work through automation, digital assistants, and self-service tools.\n\nDavid Solomon's most definitive statement about how AI will affect Goldman came in a memo he released in 2025 alongside the firm's president, John Waldron, and CFO Denis Coleman.\n\nThe memo, announcing the third iteration of the bank's cross-bank initiative OneGS, said that AI will drive efficiency at the firm, which will mean slowing hiring and reducing roles. (Goldman, with its yearly culling of some employees, is no stranger to job cuts.)\n\n\"We will constrain head count growth through the end of the year, in addition to a limited reduction in roles across the firm,\" the memo read. \"These targeted steps are consistent with our priorities of gaining more agility and creating the right team structures in order to implement effective AI solutions.\"\n\nDuring the bank's fourth-quarter earnings call Thursday, Solomon said that the firm plans to use AI to both cut costs and \"free up capacity to invest in other areas.\"\n\nSlowing hiring and increasing head count don't need to be contradictory; instead, Solomon has said the firm is focusing its hiring on the right talent.\n\n\"We need more high-value people,\" he told Axios in October. \"We can afford more high-value people to expand our footprint and continue to grow and broaden our business.\"\n\nHe has said he continues to believe that AI will grow the firm's head count over the next 10 years.\n\n\"There are obviously things where we're going to have a lot fewer people — but I'd love to have the capacity to go get more people to spend time with clients,\" Solomon said at a conference in 2025, noting that AI will have its most immediate impact on software development.\n\nCiti is in the midst of a multi-year turnaround led by the bank's CEO, Jane Fraser, to save roughly $2.5 billion and cut around 20,000 jobs.\n\nIn a memo sent to Citi's more than 200,000 employees on Wednesday, Fraser said she will \"expect to see the last vestiges of old, bad habits fall away, and a more disciplined, more confident, winning Citi fully emerge in 2026.\"\n\nFraser said in the memo that, with AI and automation, some jobs will change, some will emerge, and \"others will no longer be required.\"\n\nDuring a media briefing ahead of the firm's fourth-quarter earnings call, Mark Mason, the outgoing CFO, said he expects head count to continue trending down \"as we continue to improve productivity and tools like AI.\"\n\nFraser has previously explained how AI was already increasing productivity.\n\n\"AI-driven automated code reviews have exceeded 1 million so far this year and are dramatically improving our developers' productivity,\" she said during the bank's 2025 third-quarter earnings call. \"This innovation alone saves considerable time and creates around 100,000 hours of weekly capacity.\"\n\nThe CEO also highlighted how AI is helping Citi's customer service teams resolve client inquiries faster, its wealth advisors provide more personalized advice, and the firm's plan to launch an agent-based AI pilot to tackle more complex tasks.\n\nWells Fargo has already shrunk its head count more than 25% since the second quarter of 2020, CEO Charles Scharf said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call on Wednesday. He said that efficiency remains an \"ongoing focus\" for Wells Fargo.\n\nIn November, he told Reuters that the bank will likely \"have less head count as we look forward.\" He said the lower head count is an \"outcome\" of the firm's focus on areas where it's \"way too inefficient\" and \"way too bureaucratic.\" From 2018 to June of this year, the firm had an asset cap of $1.95 trillion, hindering its ability to grow.\n\nIn the same interview, Scharf called out those who are saying that AI won't reduce jobs.\n\n\"The opportunities that exist in AI are very significant, and anyone who sits here today and says that they don't think they'll have less head count because of AI either doesn't know what they're talking about or is just not being totally honest about it,\" he said.\n\nFollowing up on those comments in early December, Scharf clarified that most people know head count will dip, \"but they're afraid to say it, because no one wants to stand up and say that we should have — we're going to have lower head count in the future. It's a difficult thing to say.\"\n\nHe said that generative AI tools have already made Wells Fargo's engineers 30% to 35% more productive. While the bank hasn't cut coding jobs yet, the technology will eventually allow it to do more with fewer people across various functions, including compliance and legal, as well as call centers and even banking teams.\n\nBank of America has set a new industry standard, with a minimum wage of $25 an hour across the company. And while CEO Brian Moynihan conceded on a September 2025 Bloomberg TV interview that generative AI adoption has shrunk the size of some departments, the bank is focusing on training employees to do what LLMs cannot.\n\n\"The key to that is really redeploying people and re-skilling them,\" he said. \"We have to be more mindful about training them along multiple dimensions than we might have been two or three years ago.\"\n\nOn the company's fourth-quarter earnings call in January, Moynihan teased how AI might make some tasks obsolete, though, saying that the bank has 18,000 people on the payroll who code.\n\n\"Using the AI techniques, we've taken 30% out of the coding part of the stream of introducing a new product,\" he said. \"That saves us about 2,000 people. So that's how we're applying it.\"\n\nAt the Goldman financial services conference in 2025, Moynihan said the bank is managing flat overall staffing levels by redeploying employees rather than hiring more, with AI playing a central role in absorbing the additional workload. He pointed to Erica, Bank of America's consumer-facing AI assistant, as a clear example of how that is playing out in practice.\n\nIn November, Moynihan said that the bank had 1.4 billion digital connections with its customers: \"We think it saves, today, about 11,000 FT equivalents.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick didn't explicitly address how AI is impacting head count during the bank's fourth-quarter earnings call, but said \"there is no more time to waste\" when it comes to the technology.\n\nThe firm's CFO, Sharon Yeshaya, mentioned a specific operations example where the firm has outsourced some work to AI: \"We used to have two teams necessarily checking each other on different documentation to make sure things are right. We now have one human team and one AI team.\"",

    "description": "While major banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Citi, warned that a 10% credit card cap would reduce access to credit, some CEOs applaud the plan.",
    "fullText": "Business leaders have mixed reviews of President Donald Trump's new plan for credit cards.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump said on Friday he would call for a one-year cap of 10% on credit card interest rates, arguing that consumers are being \"ripped off\" by rates that he said can be as high as 20% or 30%. Congress, not the president, has the power to implement such a cap. Similar proposals have previously stalled on Capitol Hill.\n\nMajor banks, including JPMorgan Chase, UBS, and Citi, warned that a 10% cap could reduce access to credit; others in the financial sector applauded the plan.\n\nHere is how business leaders have responded so far\n\nKlarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski backs Trump's plan.\n\nSiemiatkowski told CNBC in an interview on Monday that traditional credit cards are built to encourage consumers to put most of their spending on credit, and then carry big balances at steep interest rates. That dynamic, he said, pushes people to borrow more than they should and results in higher losses, especially among lower-income borrowers.\n\n\"I think Trump is wise here and is proposing something that makes a lot of sense,\" Siemiatkowski told CNBC on Monday.\n\n\"Capitalism is great, but anarchy is not,\" Siemiatkowski added regarding consumer protection.\n\nIn another interview with CNN, Siemiatkowski also said that credit card rewards like cash back and airline miles largely benefit wealthier consumers while lower-income cardholders shoulder more of the costs.\n\nJPMorgan's CFO said that Trump's plan could upend the company's business model.\n\n\"It's a very competitive business, but we wouldn't be in it if it weren't a good business for us,\" said Jeremy Barnum during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. \"And in a world where price controls make it no longer a good business, that would present a significant challenge.\"\n\nJPMorgan said on its fourth-quarter earnings call that debit and credit card sales volume rose roughly 7% year over year and described the business as central to its retail-focused offerings.\n\nThe CEO of JPMorgan also weighed in on Trump's credit card proposal.\n\nJamie Dimon told investors on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call that reducing card interest rates could adversely affect customers with lower credit scores by limiting access to credit.\n\n\"If it happened the way it was described, it would be dramatic,\" Dimon said.\n\n\"This is a mistake, President,\" Bill Ackman, the billionaire CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, wrote on Friday on X in a now-deleted post.\n\n\"Without being able to charge rates adequate enough to cover losses and to earn an adequate return on equity, credit card lenders will cancel cards for millions of consumers who will have to turn to loan sharks for credit at rates higher than and on terms inferior to what they previously paid,\" Ackman added.\n\nAckman said in another post on Saturday that although Trump's goal is one that's \"worthy and important,\" the rate cap is not the way to achieve it.\n\n\"The best way to bring down rates would be to make it more competitive by making the regulatory regime more conducive to new entrants and new technologies,\" Ackman wrote.\n\nThe SoFi CEO believes that his business and consumers could stand to benefit from Trump's credit card rate cap.\n\n\"If this is enacted — and that's a big if, though part of me hopes it is — we would likely see a significant contraction in industry credit card lending,\" Anthony Noto wrote in a post on X. \"Credit card issuers simply won't be able to sustain profitability at a 10% rate cap.\"\n\n\"Consumers, however, will still need access to credit. That creates a large void — one that @SoFi personal loans are well positioned to fill,\" Noto added.\n\nNoto also said that personal loans could be an alternative to addressing debt, though that would make underwriting discipline and borrower education \"even more important.\"",

    "fullText": "The hottest fashion item for women in finance right now isn't a flashy accessory like a scarf or a watch, or an expensive pair of shoes. It's a good old pair of pants.\n\nThis week, I did some boots-on-the-ground reporting in Midtown Manhattan, visiting stores to ask about their best-selling women's business attire items. Time and again, pants kept coming up.\n\nBut we're not talking about any ordinary pants — in most cases, they're made with comfortable, high-quality fabric and fall on the pricier side, ranging from around $60 to $350 a pair.\n\nOften, they're also a bit baggy.\n\n\"I think wide-cut, high-waist is the trend,\" said Cassie Henry, a trader at Gresham Investment Management.\n\nHere are five of the big hitters in the Wall Street women's pants battle:\n\nPants name: The Effortless Pant\n\nAritzia has crushed earnings lately, pushing its share price up 119% over the last year.\n\nOne of the drivers of that growth? Its $148, TikTok-famous Effortless Pant.\n\nPants name: Daydrift High-Rise Trouser\n\nLululemon probably started the expensive pants craze, albeit with their athleisure wear. It was therefore no surprise that the brand launched its Daydrift pants in 2025.\n\n\"At some points it's completely sold out,\" a sales associate said. \"I\"d say it's most women's go-to whenever they come in looking for anything.\"\n\nPants name: Sloane Tailored Pant\n\nFor millennials, it's hard not to associate Abercrombie with jeans. However, the brand has made a strategic shift towards fancier attire.\n\n\"That's where everybody gets their pants from,\" said Nyla Legemah, a customer success manager for benchmarks and indices at London Stock Exchange Group in New York.\n\nPants name: Veilance Khara Pant\n\nArc'teryx is predominantly an outerwear brand — think an even more intense version of Patagonia. But the brand has gotten in on the pants gold rush, too.\n\n\"We have a lot more die-hards for the menswear stuff,\" a sales associate said. \"But they are obviously branching out into the women's line, so I think it's gaining momentum and we're seeing a lot more women coming in.\"\n\nPants name: High-Rise Fluid Crepe Trouser\n\nClub Monaco goes for the old-money vibe, and they're priced like it, too. A sales associate said their high-rise fluid crepe trouser was probably their most popular item.\n\n\"I know my friends like Club Monaco,\" Henry, the trader, said.",

    "description": "The Fed Chair sent a letter to the Senate Banking Committee in July that extensively responded to their inquiries on the Fed building renovation.",
    "fullText": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell sent a letter dated July 14, 2025, to key senators on the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, following his testimony before Congress about renovations to the central bank buildings.\n\nIn it, the Fed chair gave lawmakers a detailed and expansive response to inquiries about the renovations.\n\nPowell's letter to the Senate Banking Committee, obtained by Business Insider, was sent 10 days before giving President Donald Trump and other White House officials a tour of the renovation site on July 24, 2025.\n\nPowell announced via video message on January 11 that the Department of Justice served grand jury subpoenas to the Federal Reserve. He said the probe is into his June testimony about renovations at historic Fed office buildings, but warned that it was a pressure tactic over interest rates.\n\n\"This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions — or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.\"\n\nRep. Anna Paulina Luna accused Powell of misleading Congress and sent a criminal referral to the Justice Department, though it's unclear whether that prompted the DOJ investigation.\n\nThe letter to Sen. Tim Scott, chairman of the committee, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member, outlines the history of the Fed's Washington, DC, buildings, offers details about the repairs and working conditions, and provides information about the cost of the project's budget.\n\nThe letter was first reported by the Financial Times.\n\nPowell wrote that the Federal Reserve Board \"believes it is of the utmost importance to provide transparency for our decisions and to be accountable to the public through the Congress for our work.\"\n\nDuring Powell's testimony in June, Scott said the Fed's more than $2 billion renovation of its headquarters was excessive and likened it to the \"Palace of Versailles.\" Powell responded that many features Scott mentioned no longer exist, such as beehives, a VIP elevator, and water features, but added that the Marriner S. Eccles Building urgently needed safety upgrades and hadn't been meaningfully renovated before work began in 2022.\n\nThe White House and the Federal Reserve Board did not immediately respond to a request for comments.",

    "fullText": "If you handed Mark Cuban $100,000, he wouldn't run to Wall Street or some hot tech startup. He'd grab a shopping cart.\n\nIn a 2010 Forbes interview, the billionaire was asked what he'd do with a lump sum of $100,000. His response wasn't flashy. It wasn't cryptic. And it didn't involve crypto. It involved…toothpaste.\n\n\"First I pay off all my credit card debt and evaluate paying off any other debt I have. What I have left I put in the bank,\" he said. But he didn't stop there.\n\nThe ‘ChatGPT of Marketing' Just Opened a $0.85/Share Round — 10,000+ Investors Are Already In\n\nMissed the AI Boom's Biggest IPOs? This Platform Lets Everyday Investors Access Private Tech Early\n\nThen comes the part that sounds less like a billionaire's financial strategy and more like a Costco coupon haul: \"I try to create as much transactional value as possible from that cash. I look at my annual budgets for everything and anything, and I look to see where I can save the most money on those items. Saving 30% to 50% buying in bulk—replenishable items from toothpaste to soup, or whatever I use a lot of—is the best guaranteed return on investment you can get anywhere.\"\n\nLet's break that down. Cuban isn't saying go hoard hand sanitizer like it's 2020 again. He's saying if you already use toothpaste, toilet paper, canned soup, shampoo—things you're going to buy anyway—you might as well stock up when prices are lower. That's the ROI: buying stuff now to avoid paying more later. His version of \"investing\" isn't tied up in risk—it's about locked-in savings.\n\nLet's say you usually buy a four-pack of toilet paper for $6, but a bulk box of 30 rolls goes on sale for $20. That's about 67 cents a roll vs. $1.50 a roll. Over the year, you're not just wiping away inconvenience—you're saving real cash. Multiply that across your grocery staples and, like Cuban says, you're looking at a \"guaranteed\" ROI no stock or bond can promise.\n\nTrending: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nAnd what about the rest of that $100,000? Don't expect a fancy ETF recommendation from Cuban.\n\n\"Whatever I have left I keep in the bank and let it earn nothing,\" he said in the interview.\n\nYes—\"let it earn nothing.\" Why? Because then it's ready. Cuban's not parking money in the bank out of laziness—he's waiting for the moment he can pounce. In his world, flexibility beats short-term yield.",

    "fullText": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon defended the bank's significant spending, especially on AI and tech, during its Tuesday morning earnings call, noting that he's not only competing with other banking behemoths, but also fintech companies.\n\n\"We are going to stay out front, so help us God,\" Dimon said about the expenditures, capping off a somewhat fiery response to a question on the bank's spending from Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo. He said that the firm's not only competing against its traditional Wall Street rivals, but also fintechs like Stripe, SoFi, and Revolut, which \"are good players.\"\n\nHe added, \"We're not going to try to meet some expense target, and then 10 years from now, you'd be asking us a question, how did JPMorgan get left behind?\"\n\nIn its fourth-quarter earnings presentation, JPMorgan projected spending around $9.7 billion \n\nDimon didn't give specifics on the upcoming AI spending — he said that he's already \"been quite blunt,\" but wouldn't provide information that risk putting him at \"a competitive disadvantage\" — but said he sees huge opportunities, including in AI. While he acknowledged concerns about big spending, he said that it's the right thing to do to grow the company.\n\n\"Part of it is to trust me, I'm sorry,\" Dimon said on the anticipated returns.\n\nThe CEO said that the bank will be spending more on AI, \"but it is not a big driver\" of increased expenditures. The technology will, however, likely drive future efficiency, he said.\n\nDimon said that the bank is investing across initiatives, but that tech spending can be harder to measure or evaluate.\n\n\"We need to have the best tech in the world,\" he continued. \"That drives investment, it drives margin, it drives competition.\"\n\nLast week, JPMorgan announced plans to discontinue its use of external proxy advisors for shareholder voting in the US. In place of external human advisors, the firm is launching an in-house AI platform, called Proxy IQ, to support shareholder decisions, according to the memo.\n\nJPMorgan has implemented training programs and internal courses to teach tens of thousands of employees how to use AI tools effectively in their day-to-day work, executives have previously said.\n\nThe bank's top officials have said that junior staffers are likely to get their first experiences in management by overseeing the activities of agentic bots.\n\nArtificial intelligence specialists and technologists are among Wall Street's most sought-after minds, pitting banks against hedge funds and Big Tech in a race to claim the top talent in the space.\n\nExperts have told Business Insider in recent days to expect 2026 to be a landmark year for AI in banking, as its adoption becomes more widespread and roles experience material changes.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has reportedly been souring on Attorney General Pam Bondi over a host of issues.\n\nThe president has griped to aides in the past few weeks that Bondi isn’t doing enough to prosecute his perceived political enemies, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing administration officials and others familiar with his grousing.\n\nTrump, 79, has also complained that the government’s handling of files on dead sex predator Jeffrey Epstein has been insufficient, as have her efforts to try to prove his false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n\nSome administration officials said Trump has ramped up his criticisms of Bondi, 60, to get the Justice Department to move more quickly. Sources in touch with Bondi told the Journal that she was growing increasingly concerned about Trump’s complaints.\n\nThe Justice Department has brought charges against several Trump antagonists, but prosecutors have faced substantial setbacks.\n\nThe government is appealing November’s dismissals of its cases against New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey after a judge ruled that Trump had illegally appointed Lindsey Halligan, the attorney who obtained those indictments.\n\nSince that ruling, the Trump administration has tried and failed on two separate occasions to persuade a grand jury to indict James.\n\nMeanwhile, John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser, was indicted in October for allegedly mishandling classified documents. A trial date has yet to be determined.\n\nYet another investigation was revealed on Sunday. The Justice Department is now probing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell over comments he made to Congress about the bank’s building renovation.\n\nAccording to Trump, Bondi is also coming up short when it comes to the Epstein files, which have long cast a shadow over his presidency. That the government has produced less than 1 percent of its files, despite a law requiring their release last month, has only intensified scrutiny over the Trump-Epstein relationship and the president’s handling of it.\n\nThe Journal cites two officials who said that Trump agreed with Chief of Staff Susie Wiles’ assessment to Vanity Fair that Bondi “whiffed” on the issue.\n\nTrump’s obsession with the 2020 election has also led him to demand more from the Justice Department, according to the report.\n\nLast month, Trump resorted to issuing a symbolic pardon of Tina Peters, the former Colorado county elections clerk convicted of seven state charges, including tampering with voting machines. Peters remains in prison serving a nine-year sentence.\n\nTrump has occasionally confronted Bondi directly about his list of grievances, officials told the Journal.\n\nWhen reached for comment, the White House provided statements from Trump, Wiles, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt—all praising Bondi.\n\n“Pam is doing an excellent job,” said Trump.\n\n“She has been my friend for many years,” he added. “Tremendous progress is being made against radical left lunatics who are good at only one thing, cheating in elections and the crimes they commit.”\n\nThe Justice Department, in a brief statement, did not address the substance of the Journal’s report, telling the Daily Beast merely that Bondi “is focused on executing President Trump’s directive to Make America Safe Again.”",

Now, nearly two decades later, she sees fresh trouble brewing — this time, in the U.S. housing market.\n\n“The housing market is gummed up with existing home sales on track in 2025 to be their slowest in more than 25 years,” Whitney wrote in a piece for the Financial Times (1). “The next few years may not be much better.”\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nGet early access to privately-held AI companies with Fundrise Venture Capital for as little as $10. Join 350,000+ investors today\n\nThe problem is tied to demographic shifts. Whitney reports that over 54% of homes in the U.S. are owned by seniors — 10% more than in 2008. Most of them own their homes outright, meaning they’re mortgage-free. According to property brokerage platform Redfin, 78% of seniors want to remain in their current home rather than downsize (2).\n\nIn an interview with Marketwatch earlier this year, Whitney said, “Either these folks have no mortgage, or a small mortgage, and the capital gains that they have to take and the costs that are required to move are prohibitive (3).”\n\nHere’s how this is affecting boomers and America’s housing supply.\n\nWhitney added that the potential tax bite from selling your home means baby boomers may not be as wealthy as they think.\n\nAfter selling your primary residence, the IRS allows you to deduct up to $250,000 from the home’s selling price (or $500,000 for joint filers) to reduce your capital gains liability (4). Given that this threshold was set in 1997, it’s not nearly as helpful now as it was when home prices were far lower.\n\nWhitney is not the only one raising red flags.\n\nLast September, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said that the housing market is “in part frozen” with many homeowners reluctant to sell because they’re locked in at lower mortgage rates (5). These rates date back to the pandemic, which were between 0% and 0.25% according to Brookings (6).\n\nThe result? Persistently high prices combined with elevated interest rates, which can render homeownership harder than ever to achieve.\n\nAccording to Realtor.com, the typical U.S. household earned roughly 46% less than what’s recommended to afford a $439,950 home, which was the median list price for an American home as of July (7). In December, the median price of a home had dropped to $415,000, meaning that prices had improved — but not by much (8).",

    "fullText": "The world's most senior central bankers are rallying around Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell after he said the US government was attempting to pressure the central bank on monetary policy.\n\nOn Tuesday, a letter cosigned by the heads of 10 global central banking institutions defended Powell's integrity, calling him a \"respected colleague held in the highest regard by all who have worked with him.\"\n\n\"We stand in full solidarity with the Federal Reserve System and its Chair Jerome H. Powell,\" the letter read.\n\n\"The independence of central banks is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability in the interest of the citizens that we serve. It is therefore critical to preserve that independence, with full respect for the rule of law and democratic accountability. Chair Powell has served with integrity, focused on his mandate and an unwavering commitment to the public interest,\" the letter read.\n\nThe statement was signed by Christine Lagarde, head of the European Central Bank, and Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England chief, as well as central bank bosses from Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, South Korea, and Brazil, alongside the chair and general managers of the Bank for International Settlements.\n\nThe letter comes after Powell revealed on Sunday that the Federal Reserve had been served grand jury subpoenas by the Department of Justice, which was widely viewed as the latest escalation in an ongoing dispute between the central bank and the Trump administration over the path of interest rates.\n\n\"No one — certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve — is above the law,\" Powell said in a video statement on Sunday. \"But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"\n\nOn Monday, a group of senior figures in US economics and monetary policy, including all three living former heads of the Fed, and five former Treasury secretaries, rallied behind Powell.\n\nThat statement called the investigation \"an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine\" the independence of the Fed.\n\n\"It has no place in the United States whose greatest strength is the rule of law, which is at the foundation of our economic success,\" the statement added.",

    "fullText": "Duolingo operates the world's largest digital language-education platform, with 135 million monthly active users.\n\nThe company is using artificial intelligence to enhance the learning experience and create new revenue streams.\n\nDuolingo stock is currently trading near the cheapest level since it went public in 2021, as measured by one popular valuation metric.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Duolingo ›\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index entered 2026 near an all-time high, driven by spectacular gains in some of America's largest artificial intelligence (AI) stocks throughout last year. However, investors can still find attractive opportunities in the AI space if they're willing to venture off the beaten path.\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ: DUOL) operates the world's largest digital language-education platform and is using AI to enhance the learning experience, which is creating new opportunities to generate revenue. The company is growing rapidly, but its stock was trading at a sky-high valuation in mid-2025, so it was very hard to make the case for investing back then.\n\nHowever, Duolingo stock is now down 67% from its record high and near the cheapest level it has ever been since going public in 2021. In fact, Wall Street is forecasting solid upside from here, with most of the analysts tracked by The Wall Street Journal assigning a bullish rating to the stock. Here's why investors might regret not buying the recent dip.\n\nDuolingo takes a mobile-first approach to learning, which places advanced digital lessons at the fingertips of anyone with a smartphone. Its app also gamifies the entire experience and rewards consistent effort, which keeps users engaged. During the third quarter of 2025 (ended Sept. 30), the platform had 135.3 million monthly active users, which was a 20% increase from the year-ago period.\n\nThe company makes money in two ways: It shows ads to its free users and offers a series of paid subscription options to users who want to accelerate their learning by unlocking additional features. At the end of the third quarter, the platform's paying subscriber base soared by 34% year over year to a record 11.5 million users.\n\nDuolingo's most expensive subscription tier is called Max and offers an expanding list of AI-powered features. There's Roleplay, which uses a chatbot-style interface to help users practice their conversational skills, and also Explain My Answer, which provides users with personalized advice based on their mistakes in each lesson.",

If so, you're in for a treat.\n\nEarnings season is back, and the big banks kick things off. JPMorgan leads the way on Tuesday, followed by Bank of America and Citi on Wednesday. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley bring us home on Thursday.\n\nBI's Reed Alexander previews the four biggest things to watch from Wall Street this earnings season. From dealmaking's rebound to credit risks to AI (of course), there's a lot to unpack this week.\n\nBanks are a valuable group to open with. Their lending and dealmaking capabilities, coupled with their deep ties to consumers, put them at the epicenter of the business world. Their earnings reports are as much about themselves as the wider economy.\n\nJanuary earnings are also unique since they include a year-end recap. And what a year 2025 was …\n\nA volatile first half was followed by stocks (including banks) hitting record highs by year-end despite ongoing talk of an AI bubble. Bank executives are likely to discuss maintaining that strong momentum in 2026.\n\nThere's also a wild card to consider this earnings season.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has made it clear he's on a mission to address affordability, and sometimes that includes targeting specific companies.\n\nLast week, Trump issued warnings against the defense sector and institutional investors in the residential housing market. While the threats lacked specific details, they were strong enough to catch investors' attention.\n\nTrump also said he'd be talking more about affordability in the coming weeks, including during his speech next week at Davos.\n\nThat could be a net positive for banks. A healthy consumer is typically good for them. But with no clarity on how Trump might approach improving affordability, it's tough to say.\n\nMeanwhile, other industries will need to remain on their toes in case they're the next target on Trump's affordability crusade. And even if they feel like the problem Trump is addressing isn't necessarily applicable to them, the market might not care anyway.",

    "title": "Competition is heating up on Wall Street. Here are 4 things to watch as they report earnings.",
    "description": "From credit risks to AI, here's what experts are watching as banks, including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, prepare to report fourth-quarter earnings.",
    "fullText": "As Wall Street's biggest banks prepare to report fourth-quarter earnings next week, competition is intensifying across nearly every part of the business — from dealmaking and talent to technology. JPMorgan Chase kicks things off Tuesday, followed by Bank of America and Citi reporting on Wednesday, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley on Thursday.\n\nThat competitive pressure is shaping how investors, analysts, and executives are thinking about the coming year. In an interview, Mike Mayo, a longtime Wells Fargo analyst known for his pointed questions on earnings calls, said banks are waging the toughest fight they've faced against rivals in years to capture new business.\n\n\"The animal spirits have been unleashed,\" Mayo said, adding that competition is now \"at its most intense level since before the global financial crisis,\" with banks across the industry playing offense across sectors ranging from financial advisory to investment management to consumer banking. Even before earnings get underway, some hopeful signals are already emerging — particularly around pay.\n\nAlan Johnson, the founder of compensation consultancy Johnson Associates, said initial readouts from industry insiders at firms that have already communicated compensation are pointing to a strong year. \"Banking and trading, the big winners for bonuses this year is sort of what I'm detecting,\" Johnson said. Investment banking advisory bonuses, he added, are tracking higher than he predicted, up as much as 20% from the year prior.\n\nAs earnings season gets underway, experts say there are four key things to watch.\n\nAfter a rocky start marked by tariff worries and market volatility, dealmakers finished 2025 in the green. Worldwide M&A value rose about 45% year over year, according to LSEG data, even as the total number of deals declined slightly.\n\nIn a 2026 forecast, Goldman Sachs analysts said they expect that momentum to carry forward, projecting growth in investment banking fees and a pickup in spending by financial sponsors.\n\nMatthew Toole, LSEG's director of deals intelligence, said some private equity firms are approaching a traditional exit window for companies they bought during the pandemic, setting the stage for more sponsor-driven sales.\n\n\"Coming off of the year that we've had from an investment banking perspective — the second-largest year on record for announced M&A, the largest year on record for global debt, and also a record year for syndicated lending — I think you're going to see pretty significant growth in the investment banking fee pool,\" Toole said.\n\nThat resurgence is intensifying hiring competition. Speaking at a financials conference Goldman hosted in December, Denis Coleman, the firm's chief financial officer, acknowledged the pretty penny that it was spending to hang onto its top performers.\n\n\"We want to make sure that we're in a position to pay very competitively, particularly for our very best people,\" he said.\n\nJeanne Branthover, vice chairman of DHR International and global head of the firm's financial services and fintech practice, told Business Insider that deal momentum is translating directly into hiring pressures. \"What happens is the best talent is always going to be recruited,\" she said. \"That is always the case when a market is good.\"\n\n\"Credit is still fine, certainly we're on a cockroach alert,\" Mayo said, referencing a comment made by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon in October. The collapse of subprime auto-lenders Tricolor Holdings and auto-parts company First Brands last fall raised questions about the health of the credit market, and during his firm's third-quarter earnings call, Dimon said, \"When you see one cockroach, there's probably more.\"\n\nMayo added that a major surprise at large banks would be unlikely, but cautioned that credit cycles often begin with isolated problems, particularly at midsize firms. Leaders in the private credit industry have pushed back on claims that private lending is behind rising credit stress, saying some recent high-profile bankruptcies reflect risks tied to loans originated and syndicated by banks rather than held by private lenders.\n\nStill, Mayo offered a note of caution: \"When you're bullish, this is the time when bad loans are made.\"\n\nAt Goldman Sachs, attention is trained on OneGS 3.0, the latest iteration of the company's cross-bank initiative to maximize returns across business lines.\n\nMayo pointed to Goldman Sachs 3.0 as one of the most interesting new data points this earnings season.\n\nThe program, announced last fall, is designed as a multi-year effort to boost profitability and productivity by leveraging AI. Goldman has said the initiative includes head count discipline and limited role reductions.\n\nIf the past few years represented AI's Wild West — marked by widespread experimentation and spending — this year is about formalizing what works.\n\nSumeet Chabria, CEO of advisory firm ThoughtLinks and a former senior Wall Street technology executive, said AI has moved from isolated pilots to a core priority. He anticipates more detail from banking chiefs on how their firms are deploying AI to enhance results.\n\n\"Every line of business' strategic plan will have clarity on how they're using AI and how they're going to drive value, for sure,\" he said. \"The focus has moved from projects and programs or pilots to enterprise — to AI being a strategic priority for all the top banks.\"",

    "fullText": "US stock futures dropped Sunday night as Wall Street reacted to the Trump administration opening a criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) and futures on the S&P 500 (ES=F) fell 0.5%. Contracts tied to the Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) slumped 0.8%.\n\nInvestors were rattled late Sunday evening after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell released a statement revealing that the Department of Justice had subpoenaed the US central bank.\n\nIn an uncharacteristic video address, Powell stated \"the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June.\"\n\nPowell claimed that the move was a direct attack for the setting of interest rates that \"serve the public\" rather than \"following the preferences of the President.\"\n\nThe tumultuous start follows a strong finish to last week, when stocks climbed to fresh record highs. Both the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Dow (^DJI) closed Friday at new peaks, extending a rally that pushed the S&P 500 up more than 1% for the week. The Dow and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) posted even stronger gains, rising 2.3% and 1.9%, respectively.\n\nThe significant escalation in Trump’s feud with the Fed chair comes as markets are bracing for the latest consumer inflation report, due Tuesday. The release comes on the heels of Friday’s December jobs report, which showed continued cooling in the labor market without signaling a sharp economic slowdown.\n\nTaken together, the data has reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will remain on hold for now, with CME FedWatch offering a 95% probability of rates staying the same.\n\nBeyond the economic calendar, geopolitical developments remain a wildcard. President Trump is reportedly weighing potential action involving Iran, while also escalating pressure on Cuba over Venezuelan oil shipments. Late last week, Trump also renewed controversial comments about Greenland, saying the US could pursue control of the Danish territory “whether they like it or not.”\n\nInvestors are now turning their attention to the first major catalysts of 2026: earnings season and key inflation data. Several of Wall Street’s biggest banks are set to report in the coming days, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS).\n\nVISHNU VARATHAN, HEAD OF ⁠MACRO RESEARCH, ASIA EX-JAPAN, ‌MIZUHO, SINGAPORE\n\n\"The Fed independence question is now well and alive and maybe subject to re-evaluation every few meetings.\n\n\"I think ‍I'm still not sure how sustained and adversarial the attack on the Fed might be. There could be a scenario where Trump could still appoint someone with ​some credibility and allow this person to run the show - so ‌that's probably why markets aren't panicking as yet.\"\n\nANDREW LILLEY, CHIEF RATES STRATEGIST AT BARRENJOEY, SYDNEY\n\n\"Trump is pulling at the loose threads of central bank independence. I don't even believe that he expects that Chair Powell will be charged... The only reason that he's taking these steps is that ⁠he knows that he's not going to ​take control of the Fed, so he ​wants to exert as much undue pressure as he can.\n\n\"It is not good. Don't get me wrong, but I think ‍it will amount to ⁠nothing. Investors won't be happy about it, but it shows actually Trump has no other levers to pull. The cash rate ⁠will stay what the majority of the FOMC wants them to be.\"",

    "description": "They sit at the top of one of Wall Street's most prestigious banks at a pivotal moment in its history. Inside Padi and Neema Raphael's rise.",
    "fullText": "One recent afternoon at 200 West Street, Goldman Sachs partner Padi Raphael was walking a client toward the elevator at the bank's New York headquarters when the doors opened. Out stepped Goldman's chief data officer.\n\nThe timing couldn't have been better. The client had been asking for the chance to meet him.\n\nIt also meant Padi was coming face-to-face with the coworker she calls her \"best friend\": her brother.\n\nWhat makes the moment at the elevator so unusual isn't just that Padi and Neema Raphael are siblings. It's that both have risen to become partners at Goldman, placing them among roughly 500 people at a firm of roughly 49,000.\n\nThey now steer parts of the firm that are essential to its future.\n\nPadi, 47, is the global cohead of the third-party wealth business at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, having built her career in markets and client-facing roles across Europe and Asia. She's center ring in a hot sector for the firm, working with broker-dealers, private banks, and investment advisors to attract more wealthy clients.\n\nNeema, 44, rose through the tech business and now leads hundreds of engineers who work on the bank's data and AI systems. His role is central to Goldman's push into artificial intelligence, a priority for CEO David Solomon.\n\n\"Our clients have a huge appetite for hearing his insights on all things data-related,\" Padi told Business Insider in a joint interview with her brother. For years, she joked, Neema was known internally as Padi's younger brother. Now, the shorthand has flipped.\n\nThe elevator encounter captured the unusual convergence of two careers that had spent decades running in parallel — for most of their time at Goldman, the siblings worked in different divisions and on different continents. Only recently did they begin showing up to the same office.\n\nThey shared with Business Insider an intimate look at how they navigated their rise.\n\nThe Raphael siblings grew up in Los Angeles, the children of Iranian immigrants who emphasized the importance of education. Their parents collectively hold three master's degrees and a Ph.D.\n\n\"We made education and learning a priority, and encouraged curiosity, reasoning, and discourse,\" their parents, Nora Ghodsian and Bijan Raphael, said via email.\n\nGrowing up, neither imagined a career in financial services. Padi studied neuroscience at UCLA. Neema went on to study computer science at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nPadi arrived at Goldman first, almost by accident. A mentor encouraged her to talk to the firm, telling her it would teach her things she had yet to learn. She joined in 1999 as an analyst, after a hiring process she still remembers as grueling.\n\n\"I'd fly in, do 12 interviews, and then fly back home,\" Padi, who was still living on the West Coast at the time, said. The firm did this three times — more than 30 interviews in total — a process she later suspected was a test of endurance.\n\nShe spent her first year in New York in asset management before relocating to London in 2000, where she moved into equity derivatives sales on the trading floor and built a career there.\n\nA few years later, her brother called.\n\nAfter college, Neema was keen to apply his tech training to a real-world business like Goldman. He asked his sister if she could help him get a foot in the door.\n\nPadi couldn't promise more than introductions, but agreed to circulate his résumé. She also offered advice: \"Be yourself and be thoughtful and show them your work,\" Neema recalled her telling him. He got the job, joining the technology division as an analyst in 2003.\n\nFive years later, at the height of the financial crisis, Neema's team helped Goldman assess its exposure quickly because his team had helped digitize key systems. The effort earned an internal award typically reserved for dealmakers — and cemented his focus on the intersection of data and finance.\n\nEarly in his career, his manager asked if he would consider moving to Tokyo. Unsure what the request meant for his prospects at the bank, Neema called his sister. Her reaction was swift and definitive.\n\n\"You have to do that,\" she told him. \"That's a no-brainer.\"\n\nPadi encouraged him, she said, because she believed that \"any adventure, any opportunity to broaden your perspective about the world, about people, about the business\" was worth taking.\n\nWhile the siblings' careers unfolded in very different parts of the firm, they continued comparing notes. Making partner was the next milestone.\n\nPadi was named a partner in 2016. Her career had taken her from the equities trading floor during the Dot-com bust to returning from maternity leave during the recession, to navigating the European financial crisis in London, and to experiencing the coronavirus pandemic in Hong Kong.\n\nFour years later, it was Neema's turn. He became a partner in 2020, which Padi said marked the first year he was under consideration. The role brought a shift: greater visibility inside a firm where data and technology had become increasingly central.\n\nIn 2022, Padi moved back to New York after nearly a decade in Hong Kong.\n\n\"Coming back home to the US was a natural choice for our growing family,\" she said. And it came as Solomon and his deputy, President and COO John Waldron, were combining Goldman's asset and wealth management businesses. The two leaders were \"seeking to reinforce our asset management business' client leadership group with seasoned partners from around the firm,\" she added.\n\nFor a stretch, Padi and her family stayed with Neema and his family. They often headed to the office together.\n\nOutside work, the siblings' closeness is unmistakable. Padi has three children — two teenagers and a kindergartener — while Neema is raising a young family, including a four-year-old and a newborn. Their kids are best friends, they said, and Friday nights are reserved for Shabbat dinners, with both families gathering to mark the end of the week together.\n\nThat dynamic was on display at Goldman's annual winter gathering in Miami for its global partners, where the firm fills a wall with the names of every partner it has ever named. Like everyone else in attendance, the Raphael siblings went in search of theirs. A stylistic break in the display left Neema's name at the end of one section, and Padi's at the beginning of another.\n\nThey tracked both down and snapped selfies in front of each — a quiet marker of two careers that ran in parallel for two decades before converging at the top.",

    "title": "Everything we know about how Wall Street's biggest firms, from JPMorgan to Blackstone, are adopting AI",
    "description": "Finance's biggest firms are considering how AI might impact jobs, how it could cut costs, and reduce \"grunt work.\"",
    "fullText": "Welcome to Wall Street's AI era.\n\nBanks, private equity firms, hedge funds, and asset managers have been eager to use generative AI to boost productivity and reduce grunt work for workers.\n\nBusiness Insider has been reporting on how some of finance's biggest players are approaching artificial intelligence, from its potential impact on jobs and the creation of new ones, to the various ways firms are cutting costs and ramping up efficiencies.\n\nBut first — if you work at a Wall Street firm and are using AI, we want to hear from you. How is AI really showing up in your day-to-day? Is it living up to the hype?\n\nAI is set to reshape roughly 44% of banking work by 2030, according to consulting firm ThoughtLinks — and Wall Street's biggest firms are racing to get there first.\n\nJPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank by assets, is spending $18 billion a year on technology, with AI a central focus. CEO Jamie Dimon is a \"tremendous\" user of the bank's generative AI tools, which have now been rolled out to more than 200,000 employees.\n\nThe bank is also replacing long-standing human processes with AI. Its asset-management arm announced plans to stop using external proxy advisers for US shareholder voting, instead launching an in-house AI platform, Proxy IQ, which will analyze data from more than 3,000 annual company meetings. Executives have said the bank is training employees to use AI in ways that deliver measurable productivity gains.\n\nGoldman Sachs is spending $6 billion on technology this year — a figure CEO David Solomon has said he wishes were higher. In an October memo outlining the latest phase of its OneGS initiative, the bank said AI would drive efficiency, slow hiring, and lead to a \"limited reduction\" in roles. Goldman has since rolled out internal AI tools, including an assistant now available to employees across the firm.\n\nMorgan Stanley, an early OpenAI partner, has focused on turning employee ideas into working AI products. One internally built tool, called DevGen.AI has already saved engineers more than 280,000 hours this year. Among interns, AI adoption is especially strong: 72% say they use ChatGPT daily or several times a week.\n\nCitigroup has also accelerated its push. Nearly 180,000 employees across 83 countries now have access to Citi's proprietary AI tools, which have been used almost 7 million times this year. CEO Jane Fraser said the bank's generative AI tools are saving about 100,000 developer hours a week through automated code reviews. Citi also began piloting agentic AI with 5,000 employees in September.\n\nIn the ultracompetitive world of hedge funds, being ahead on the latest technology is always a priority.\n\nIn December, Citadel said its stockpickers are using an internal chatbot to speed up their processes and find new info at his $71 billion hedge fund.\n\nAt the 2025 Global Milken conference, Andreas Kreuz, WorldQuant's deputy CIO, said the firm was using AI to expand the data it can bring into its models since it can restructure data from images and audio.\n\nPoint72's CTO Ilya Gaysinskiy told BI about his big plans to ramp up Point72's tech organization and how AI will play into that expansion.\n\nBridgewater launched a fund driven by AI in 2024. The fund's AIA Labs worked to replicate every stage of the investment process with machine learning. The firm's co-chief investment officer and chief scientist outlined the plans of the world's largest hedge fund.\n\n$29 billion hedge fund Balyasny has built an AI bot that it believes will be able to do the grunt work that typically falls to senior analysts — a potential huge timesaver for investment teams. The manager told Business Insider in 2024 that roughly 80% of the firm's staff use its AI tools, which include the internal chatbot BAMChatGPT, and recently hired Matthew Henderey, one of the CIA's AI developers, as a data science executive. Man Group and Viking Global have also developed their own internal offerings.\n\nLucia Soares — Carlyle's chief information officer and head of technology transformation — talked to BI about taking on a new challenge: Bringing AI to the investment giant's 2,300 global employees.\n\nPrivate equity firms are no strangers to managing and analyzing copious amounts of data — but data is only helpful if you can find it. Blackstone has invested in improving its enterprise search and is also betting AI will give it a leg up in its pursuit to capture more of the insurance market.\n\nSwedish PE giant EQT built an AI engine called Motherbrain that has changed how its investors source deals. ChatGPT enables the investing giant to take the next step with its AI ambitions.\n\nAs private equity firms turn to AI for a competitive edge, Thomas H. Lee says its engineers are up to 30% more productive with help from AI coding assistants.\n\nAI tools are changing how stock-pickers do their job. AllianceBernstein, BlackRock, and JPMorgan opened up on how their tools are speeding up portfolio manager workflows.\n\nBlackRock has introduced Asimov, the agentic AI platform for the firm's fundamental equity business. Business Insider talked to Kirsty Craig, head of research, data, and AI strategy for portfolio management tech, who helped develop the tool.\n\nThe multi-billion-dollar investment manager VanEck invested in a Toronto-based startup and is onboarding its technology to boost its ETF business. An executive and the fintech's CEO walked us through how AI will change the jobs of analysts and salespeople.\n\nKraken's $1.5 billion acquisition of a retail trading startup made headlines last March. Less noticed was how the crypto exchange used generative AI to run due diligence on the target — a process its head of M&A now considers core to his team's work.\n\nAt Block, Jack Dorsey's fintech behind Square, Afterpay, and Cash App, engineers built an AI agent that can write code faster — and in some cases better — than senior developers. The company ultimately decided to open-source the tool, even as it gives competitors a look under the hood.\n\nChime has taken a similar in-house approach. In 2023, the neobank built a private, ChatGPT-style assistant to help engineers ship products more quickly and at lower cost. The company's CTO shared how the tool has become a key part of Chime's product-development playbook.",

    "description": "Industry insiders say Trump's call to ban big investors is out of sync with how those players actually buy homes.",
    "fullText": "Trump's pledge to upend Wall Street's 15-year push into the market for single-family American homes raised alarms across the real estate investment industry — and skepticism.\n\n\"I'm not concerned about it,\" said Todd Henderson, the head of real estate for the Americas at DWS, an investment firm that has purchased single-family rental homes.\n\nWhile details of Trump's proposal are unknown, Henderson expects that it will eventually exclude institutional buyers who have purchased newly built homes, which have become the focus of much of the single-family rental (SFR) industry.\n\n\"The fear is that large investors are buying single-family homes and that it's taking out of the sales pool and driving up the cost of housing — that's what is driving this discussion,\" Henderson said. \"We're building this stuff and adding it to supply.\"\n\nIn a message on his social media platform Truth Social on Wednesday, Trump said that he was \"immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes.\"\n\n\"People live in homes, not corporations,\" Trump wrote.\n\nSome analysts, however, suggested that that view was out of step with the institutional SFR industry's contemporary business model, which has shifted away from the inefficient — and politically sensitive practice — of competing against everyday homebuyers to scoop up properties one by one.\n\nInvitation Homes, a public company that is one of the largest owners of SFR homes, \"has almost exclusively moved to acquiring homes from homebuilders rather than on the MLS,\" according to a research note from RBC.\n\n\"AMH's external growth comes from development rather than acquisitions,\" Barclays wrote in a report, referring to American Homes 4 Rent, another large SFR owner.\n\nTrump's announcement caused shares of Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent to fall by about 7% and 9% respectively, according to KBW.\n\nOther major investors, including Blackstone, also saw an impact on share prices. Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, a non-trade REIT managed by the firm, holds about $11 billion worth of SFR investments totaling about 9% of its portfolio.\n\nJade Rahmani, an analyst at KBW, wrote that the market reaction \"seems excessive and could present a buying opportunity\" in a Wednesday report on the potential ban.\n\nDetails were scant about how Trump's prohibition on Wall Street homebuying would work.\n\nTrump said that he would be \"calling on Congress to codify it\" and that he would \"discuss this topic\" during \"my speech in Davos in two weeks.\"\n\nTrump has walked back policies, such as his tariffs, due to disruptions to the economy and investor concerns.\n\nThe likely need for congressional approval could insert more complexity — and uncertainty — over the process of formalizing an SFR ban.\n\nA Mizuho report said that Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno had proposed a bill to codify Trump's SFR ban, but that it \"doesn't believe\" it will progress \"anytime soon.\"\n\nHenderson said he believes that any rules imposed on the SFR industry would exempt both builders and buyers of new SFR homes and would allow major investors to sell existing portfolios freely. Such caveats would leave the SFR industry basically unchanged.\n\n\"I think it will increase the value of the purpose-built SFR homes and make that strategy even more valuable,\" Henderson said.\n\nThe SFR industry has pointed out that its investors own a comparatively small share of the roughly 80 million single-family homes in the country.\n\nIn October 2023, Parcl Labs found that investors who own 10 residential units or more held about 3.4% of all single-family homes, and that larger investors with at least 1,000 units controlled just 0.73% of the inventory.\n\n\"Professional single-family housing providers represent a small segment of the overall housing market, and the single-family rental industry remains focused on supporting renters while also supporting pathways to homeownership,\" said a spokeswoman for National Rental Home Council, an industry group that represents SFR owners.",

    "description": "Recession fears have cooled, but a labor market chart flagged by one bearish strategist might give bullish investors pause.",
    "fullText": "Recession fears have cooled off in recent months as the US economy continues to prove resilient (did you see that GDP number?) and the Federal Reserve slashes interest rates.\n\nBut a labor market chart flagged by one bearish strategist on Tuesday might give investors pause.\n\nThe chart, shared in a client note from Société Générale's Albert Edwards, shows the US unemployment rate (in red) alongside its three-year moving average (dotted line). Since 1950, in eight instances where the unemployment rate has begun an uptrend and broken through its three-year moving average, a recession has followed.\n\n\"Recession is the biggest threat to equities, although in recent downturns financial problems have preceded (or caused) recessions,\" Edwards wrote in the note. \"I don't think any guru is forecasting a recession in 2026. Yet the simple correlation shown below has a 100% track record of success.\"\n\nThe chart mirrors the concept of the Sahm Rule Recession Indicator, which says that the US economy is in a recession when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate increases by more than 0.5% from its lows over the previous 12 months. In other words, if unemployment rises too quickly, it signals that things are about to get worse.\n\nAlthough it had been hailed for its back-tested accuracy since its release in 2019, the gauge produced its first false reading in August 2024.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the labor market weakens materially, as Edwards' chart suggests could happen. Hiring rates and job openings remain sluggish. But other important measures of the economy's health — like consumer spending and GDP growth — remain strong.\n\nAnother signal that a recession could be on the way, according to Edwards, is a steepening of the Treasury yield curve following its inversion. However, while falling short-term rates following an inversion are usually accompanied by a floundering job market and consumer, today's economy seems to be in a stronger starting place.",

    "fullText": "New Year's Eve is behind us, but if you hear the sound of bottles popping — it might be coming from the halls of Morgan Stanley's headquarters.\n\nThe Wall Street bank on Wednesday announced the appointment of 184 new managing directors — a roughly 6% increase from last year's class of 173 MDs.\n\nAt Morgan Stanley, managing director is the firm's highest designation. The announcement comes amid the annual promotion season on Wall Street and follows Goldman Sachs' November elevation of more than 600 managing directors, part of a biennial process at the rival firm.\n\nThe size of each of Morgan Stanley's annual MD classes has fluctuated. In 2024, the bank named 155 managing directors. In 2023, it also appointed 184; and in 2022, it elevated 199.\n\nSeventy percent of the newly appointed execs work in a revenue-generating capacity, interacting with clients and making the bank money, while 30% work in middle- and back-office or corporate functions.\n\nThe promotions come after a strong year for the firm's dealmaking business. Morgan Stanley finished third on the worldwide M&A financial advisory league tables, according to LSEG, trailing only Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan.\n\nIt ended the year advising on more than $1 trillion in deal value across more than 400 transactions, LSEG's December data show. That marked a significant jump from the prior year, when the bank advised on roughly $707 billion in deals across 368 mergers or acquisitions.\n\nAcross Wall Street, headhunters and investment bankers have told Business Insider in recent weeks that they expect 2026 to generate robust activity in mergers and the capital markets. That backdrop may help explain why 48% of Morgan Stanley's new managing directors came from its Institutional Securities Group, which advises corporate clients on IPOs, buyouts, and sales.\n\nThe bank informed the newly elevated executives on Wednesday and is expected to release the full list of names publicly in the coming days. The firm has also communicated bonuses to its employees, one of the first on Wall Street to inform workers how their contributions from last year resulted in their incentive compensation.\n\nBelow is a look at the statistics Morgan Stanley shared about the composition of its 2026 managing director class.\n\n70% in Revenue, 30% in Infrastructure, the firm's middle- and back-office or corporate functions.\n\nRegionally, Americas 67%, EMEA 18%, Asia 14%\n\nOf US-based MD promotes, 31% of the class are ethnically diverse and 69% are White.",

    "description": "We compiled a list of books that top Wall Streeters have recommended over the years that have helped them get ahead.",
    "fullText": "\"I recently read 'The Master, ' the biography of Roger Federer, who some would argue is one of the best (tennis) players, if not the best player, of all time. Every time I read one of the tennis biographies, you're reminded that it's a very all-consuming commitment to be one of the greatest. At least in the case of tennis, it's a very lonely existence. You're the only person out there. You in your mind battling it out. The key is making sure you surround yourself with the right team.\n\n\"Every player, at least in the major tournaments, has a player's box. You'll have the family, the coach, and some friends in the player's box.\n\n\"The lesson I think is who's in my player's box?  How do they help me keep going? And, similarly, at least in the investing world, am I in the player's box for others? How do I be the best person on the sidelines supporting?\"\n\n- Vinay Trivedi, General Atlantic\n\n\"This book explores sleep's impact on your body and mind.\"\n\n\"Before the coronavirus pandemic, I was a daily 4:30 A.M. workout warrior and advocate for holistic nutrition, but I certainly was not prioritizing sleep in my health equation. This was an eye-opening and convincing read that has helped me to get significantly more shut-eye.\"\n\n- Lacey Vigmostad Giliberto, JP Morgan\n\n\"I'm a bad sleeper. This book puts in layman's terms why you need to sleep and why it's important for so many reasons.\"\n\n\"It was a really interesting dichotomy. It's about a young African-American man who grew up in a rougher neighborhood in Newark but went to Yale and ended up being really successful in his academic work. But he struggled at times to mesh the two worlds together.\"\n\n\"It shows that the path to equality isn't always as easy and seamless. Going to Yale on a scholarship, it can still be really hard for people. People often don't get that.\"\n\n-Mir Subjally, Compass Rose Asset Management\n\n\"I am a little biased because I started my career at Citigroup, which is formerly Salomon Brothers. I also recommend 'Panic!' by Michael Lewis, and I generally like all the 'Market Wizards' series, which are helpful in knowing what fits your trading style and what doesn't.\"\n\n\"It shows that it's not just about you. In the grand scheme of things, it's how you help others along the way. How you can grow the pie for everyone.\"\n\n\"It's about striving to be somebody who gives to others and then expects nothing in return,\" she said, \"and how ironically fruitful that can be for your own life and career.\"\n\n- Lacey Vigmostad Giliberto, JP Morgan\n\nThe book holds insights into \"all the wrong reasons why you can go into finance.\"\n\n- Daniel Costanza, previously a head of data analytics at Yieldstreet\n\n\"It taught me that all decision-making should be driven by the gap between expected value and market price, and expected value is calculated by weighing each outcome by its probability of occurring.\n\n\"Second-level thinking is all about finding value that others don't appreciate yet. It's risk/reward times the coefficient of likelihood for being right.\"\n\n\"It's pretty technical, but a must-read for any quant.\"\n\n-Robert Lam, Man Group's Man Numeric\n\n\"I spend a lot of time with founder-led companies within the tech world. I like working with them because they're very focused on disrupting the status quo, not just in the businesses they're building but in anything they do, and that includes working with bankers and advisors writ large.\"\n\n\"They really force their advisors to think outside the box and challenge the traditional way of doing things. Part of Adam Grant's book is talking about what makes founders founders, and it's been incredible watching them ask a question that might be perceived as basic, but there's really sort of that double layer of, 'Why is it being done this way, and why can't we do it in a better, more efficient way?'\"\n\n\"He wrote this book that really shares some tips about how to have a happier life and ways that you can streamline things in your work; how to find a better work-life balance; and how to think about where you'd like to spend your time and how you're spending your time and the types of things you're investing in.\"\n\n\"I've picked up so many helpful tips and tricks from there. I feel like it's a must-read for people — financial-related or not, I think it applies to all different industries — on really how to take a step back and identify what is meaningful to you. And are you spending the right amount of time on things that you deeply care about versus things that are just, you know, background noise?\"\n\n\"I always thought a lot about what motivates people, how humans work, and what motivates them. I really appreciated his research and his take on that.\"\n\n\"It's one of the best management books. I think what's unique about the book is when I first looked at the title, I was a little bit intimidated by it — like, this is just for executive positions.\n\n\"But he looks at everyone being an executive in their role, and he provides some extremely practical advice on how to become more effective in anything we do in our everyday life. Some are well-known — such as time management, focusing on strengths.\n\n\"Even those obvious things that he brings up, he makes it so simple to apply in your everyday life. For example, on time management, there are just two questions you need to ask yourself on a regular basis: What would happen if I don't do certain things? And can these things be done by somebody else?\n\n\"That helps you to eliminate a lot of time-wasters and use time more wisely. Super simple, but at the same time, quite practical.\"\n\n- Mikhail Krayzler, Allianz Global Investors\n\n\"It's a book framed through the teaching of Marcus Aurelius, who was also a Roman emperor, and it covers how to optimize situations and make the best out of everything. The book does a great job of translating philosophy into modern context.\"\n\n\"As for how that translates to me: Clients expect a trusted advisor to maintain poise and equanimity in situations that are stressful to them. So this has been helpful in taking a teaching that is 2,000-plus years old and transferring it to the 21st century.\"\n\n- Christopher Oglesby, Bank of America\n\n\"Everything in the investing business is relationship-based, and Henry and George, the KKR founders, often talk about doing business with people you like and trust. This is a book I've read three or four times and is really a staple.\"\n\n\"What the author is trying to do is to help the reader look at the world and analyze global trends in a more objective way. In a very engaging and comical way, he shows you that human beings tend to think that the world is more dramatic than it really is. So people's brains are systematically misinterpreting the state of the world.\n\n\"Something that really hits on that point is the beginning of the book. He presents the reader with a set of 13 questions. Each question has three multiple-choice answers. The bottom line is that most people actually score lower than the theoretical chimpanzee would have on these questions.\n\n\"He tries to walk you through a formula to avoid looking at the world in this overly dramatized way. I think he's not talking specifically about the financial markets, but I think it's so relevant to investing because this is part of the way you can capitalize on opportunities.\"\n\n- Unoma Okolo,  Artisan Partners\n\n\"It's a great book about monetary policy in the Depression era that has major implications for how monetary policy and currencies have evolved.\"\n\n- Phil Salinger, former Bridgewater Associates\n\nThe book emphasizes \"how a growth mindset — or the belief that talents can be developed with hard work and good strategies and input from others — can enable much better outcomes than people with a fixed mindset, which is believing that talents are just innate gifts.\"\n\n\"The reason that a growth mindset matters so much is that it fosters an emphasis on learning and intellectual curiosity instead of trying to seem like the smartest person in the room, and that's something that I often reflect on for my own personal development as well, as a quality to look for as we bring on really amazing management teams.\"\n\n- Lexie Bartlett, General Atlantic\n\n\"For me, it's a game plan of how to actually seek solutions to the biggest existential threat that we actually face as a species and as a planet. Whenever I introduce people to the book, you see people get obsessed with the kinds of things that we can be doing, whether that's regenerative agriculture, renewable energy, or reducing food waste.\"\n\n\"Being a Fidelity person, I had to pick a Peter Lynch book. Beating the Street has been one of my favorites, such a classic. It's about how Peter ran Magellan day-to-day. And so I've just found it to be an excellent guide to investment processes for new fund managers.\"\n\n- Jennifer Fo Cardillo, Fidelity\n\n\"Much has been said about 'Margin of Safety' over the years, but in my opinion nothing quite compares to the original \"Security Analysis\" by Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd. They epitomized the concept through their careful approach, still relevant to this day.\"\n\n- Paul Kamenski, Man Group's Man Numeric\n\n\"I recently read 'Shoe Dog,' which is Phil Knight's autobiography and the story of how he founded Nike. I chose it because our firm is, in some respects, a startup, as we are launching new lines of business and building upon others, and I wanted to learn about an entrepreneur's success story.\n\nNike certainly had some difficult and existential issues in its early years, and the book was a good reminder about the importance of perseverance and believing in the value of one's work.\"\n\n- Jackie Klaber, Rockefeller Capital Management\n\n\"It is an interesting read, and I enjoy how David Einhorn seems so relentless when he believes in something.\"\n\n- Tanaka Maswoswe, Carlyle Group\n\nBob Iger, a former CEO at Disney, \"early on saw the need to create digital channels for his customers and understood the virtuous cycle he could create around the right types of content, which informed his M&A strategy. Some of the M&A moves that he did in the preceding 10 years were really prescient.\"\n\n\"Reading the stories of great investors is both fun and informative. What's most interesting is the commonalities you see between the two investors despite radically different approaches and asset classes.\"\n\n- Philip Dobrin, Bridgewater Associates\n\n\"There's a lot of game theory involved, analyzing big data to predict outcomes. The concepts in that book and trilogy are very relevant today.\"\n\n\"Looks at the benefits of late specialization and a diversity of experience, and how knowledge in a variety of arenas can pay off, especially when solving complex problems that require creative solutions.\"\n\nWe read it as part of an Asian-American affinity group at TPG. It's a very tactical book on how Asian Americans can advance in the workplace, and it's written in a style that gives stories of actual people but gives very tangible advice. I enjoyed it quite a bit.\n\n\"Compared with what has now often become fairly complex and evolved, his works as an early adopter of the approach were simple, intuitive, and persuasive, establishing clear roots for what it means to use a systematic approach.\"\n\n- Paul Kamenski, Man Group's Man Numeric\n\nA \"must-read\" for any aspiring tech investors.\n\n\"The book best represents how I think about investing and also articulates the success stories and habits of the best CEOs of the 20th century.\"\n\n- Sims Lansing, Lansing Management\n\n\"'Flash Boys' was a prime example of how technological innovation and forward-thinkers can reshape an entire industry. In 'Flash Boys,' novel computer algorithms and communications networks caused both market structure and behavioral changes to the trading industry.\n\n\"Similarly, today we're experiencing the confluence of cryptography, blockchain technology, and distributed systems, which are meaningfully challenging preconceived notions of not just the financial industry but what constitutes money.\"\n\n- Michael Sonnenshein, Securitize\n\n\"We have all this data and information on our laptops and on our phones, but it's not organized. So is it really serving us, is it really useful for us?\n\n\"The book talks about knowledge management systems and how to organize the data in such a way that works for the individual, and ultimately, getting to a point where we can share that with others.\"",

Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he wanted a lighter workload so that he could use his time more “efficiently,” not because of his advanced age. Unfortunately for the president, his staff has not yet pared down his schedule.",

    "description": "Microsoft is leading Wedbush's AI stock list as its favorite large-cap tech company to own in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Wall Street's loudest tech bull has given his five top AI stock picks for next year, and Nvidia isn't one of them.\n\nThat's a bit of a surprise for Dan Ives, the Wedbush Securities analyst known for his vocal cheerleading for the stock as it climbed to records throughout the year.\n\nHe's instead focused on a handful of other mega-cap names heading into 2026, and sees AI approaching an \"inflection point\" next year, he write in a new note to clients.\n\n\"While Nvidia remains in our top tech names into 2026, there are 5 AI-focused names that we believe will be front and center heading into 2026,\" Ives said.\n\nWedbush's price target: $625 (+28% upside)\n\nRationale: Wall Street looks like it's underestimating the growth Microsoft could see with Azure. The company also looks poised to make an \"AI driven shift\" next year, Wedbush said, adding that Microsoft was its favorite large-cap tech stock to own in 2026.\n\n\"While AI use cases built markedly in FY25, its clear FY26 for Microsoft remains the true inflection year of AI growth as CIO lines build for deployments.\"\n\nWedbush's price target: $350 (+28% upside)\n\nRationale: Wedbush said it believed Apple would begin monetizing its AI products over the next few years. That could add $75 to $100 of value per share of company stock, Ives estimated.\n\n\"The elephant in the room remains the invisible AI strategy, with the biggest consumer installed base in the world of 2.4 billion iOS devices and 1.5 billion iPhones, the time is now for Apple to accelerate its AI efforts,\" he wrote.\n\nWedbush's price target: $600 (+32% upside)\n\nRationale: 2026 could be a \"monster year\" for Tesla as the EV company makes more ground on its AI and robotics initiatives, Ives suggested. He pointed to the company's ongoing development of its full self-driving technology and its Cybercab, which is expected to begin production in April next year.\n\n\"We believe Tesla could reach a $2 trillion market cap over the coming year and in a bull case scenario $3 trillion by the end of 2026,\" Wedbush said.\n\nWedbush's price target: $230 (+27% upside)\n\nRationale: Demand for Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform remains \"unprecedented,\" Ives said.\n\n\"With the company making strategic moves to remain at the forefront of AI, we believe that PLTR has a golden path to become a trillion-dollar market cap company and will grow into its valuation as Karp and Co. remain one of the largest players in the AI Revolution.\"\n\nWedbush's price target: $600 (+26% upside)\n\nRationale: CrowdStrike is gaining momentum in its AI deals. It also appears to be gaining market share as it expands its product suite.\n\n\"CrowdStrike remains one of our favorite tech names,\" Ives said. \"We believe the Street is underestimating the growth potential for CrowdStrike with cybersecurity remaining a second/third derivative beneficiary of the AI Revolution which speaks to our bullishness.\"",

    "fullText": "Tesla had a surprise Christmas present for investors this year: more bad news about its EV business.\n\nElon Musk's automaker published a press release on Monday with a consensus of analyst predictions for the company's latest quarterly sales, the first time it has publicly given Wall Street such a heads-up.\n\nThe delivery consensus, which is a compilation of predictions from analysts selected by Tesla, estimated that the EV giant sold 422,850 vehicles in the last three months of 2025, around 14.6% fewer than the same period last year.\n\nThat's lower than Wall Street's wider expectations. Analysts were expecting Tesla to sell 440,907 EVs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nIt's also a surprising move from Tesla, which typically does not issue public communications ahead of critical sales announcements.\n\nTesla, which is expected to report its latest quarterly sales as soon as Friday, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"This is highly unusual for Tesla to send out a press release with quarterly consensus delivery estimates,\" said Gary Black, managing partner at Future Fund, which sold its Tesla holdings in May.\n\nBlack wrote in the Tuesday post on X that the release suggested Tesla's Q4 sales were lower than the Bloomberg consensus and were, in his view, likely closer to 420,000.\n\nTesla's stock price hit a record high this month amid investor optimism over the company's robotaxi push, but the Cybertruck maker's core EV business has had a difficult year.\n\nTesla was hit hard by the collapse in electric car sales after the $7,500 federal tax credit expired in September.\n\nThe company's US sales reportedly fell to their lowest level since 2022 in November, despite the launch of cheaper versions of Tesla's bestselling Model 3 and Y EVs.\n\nThings haven't gone much better outside the US. Tesla has been buffeted by fierce competition from local rivals in China, where an army of EV startups has rolled out high-tech electric vehicles at rock-bottom prices.\n\nIn Europe, meanwhile, the US automaker's sales have collapsed nearly 30% so far this year amid backlash over Musk's political interventions.\n\nThe slump has left Tesla facing a race against time to avoid its second consecutive annual sales decline.\n\nTesla has rolled out a range of incentives in the US and is pushing to introduce its Full Self-Driving tech in China and Europe, but the surprise delivery consensus estimated that Tesla will end the year having sold over 100,000 fewer EVs than in 2024.",

    "fullText": "MarketsBy Alexandra Semenova and Sagarika JaisinghaniSaveAt the big banks and the boutique investment shops, an optimistic consensus has taken hold: the US stock market will rally in 2026 for a fourth straight year, marking the longest winning streak in nearly two decades.There’s plenty of angst about the risks to the bull run that’s pushed the S&P 500 Index up some 90% since its October 2022 low. The artificial-intelligence boom could turn to bust. The economy — and the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate decisions — could defy expectations. And President Donald Trump’s second year could bring even more unanticipated shocks than his first.",

    "description": "For Wall Streeters, finding the time to shop for presents can be tough.",
    "fullText": "Work schedules don't always have much sympathy for holiday plans — especially the notoriously grueling hours of the finance industry.\n\nWhen it comes to carving out time for gifting, some Wall Streeters opt to outsource the task, while others shop at convenient stores close to, or even within, their offices.\n\n\"This time of year, time seems to move a little bit faster,\" said Elisabeth Brown, the director of US membership at luxury travel and lifestyle concierge company Knightsbridge Circle.\n\nBrown said that gift help is a popular service among members, and that Knightsbridge Circle will suggest, buy, and even deliver items. Members devote time to talking about their preferences, and later to approving purchases, but otherwise pass off the responsibility.\n\nOther finance employees turn to personal shoppers for help. David Thielebuele, the fashion director of ready-to-wear at Bloomingdale's, said in an email that people turn to personal shoppers for a mix of \"convenience and expertise,\" especially during the end-of-year crunch. The personal shopping team can refine lists, buy items, and build event wardrobes.\n\n\"The real challenge is decision fatigue,\" Thielebuele said. Many clients can only devote fragmented chunks of time to gifting, he added, compounding the issue.\n\nFor those who do handle the shopping on their own, though, stores near the office can offer an easy solution. Jeremy Balrup, who covers sales and analytics for Bloomberg's enterprise data business and has worked in finance for around a decade, said he often stops by department stores near his office in Midtown Manhattan to buy gifts. If he's buying a sweater, he said he'll visit the J. Press store in Grand Central.\n\nThose who work at Goldman Sachs might not even have to leave the office to pick up gifts. The firm hosts a holiday market in New York, London, and Dallas offices, featuring graduates of its 10,000 Small Businesses program. Around 80 vendors sold their items between the fairs, and Goldman's global head of corporate engagement, Asahi Pompey, called it \"one of the most joyful days on our calendar.\"\n\nFor some, the holiday commitment goes beyond shopping alongside colleagues.\n\nIn a Business Insider survey about Wall Street gifting, about 40% of the respondents who said they work in finance said they were considering buying their colleagues presents. The most popular items to get them were wine or liquor, according to the unscientific survey, and Balrup said that a nice bottle is always a hit in his office's white elephant game.\n\nEileen Rizzo, the CEO of Zachys Wine and Liquor, said that her company's analytics show that people with interests in banking and investment are among the most active audience segments, and that New York is the most active market. Champagne is always hugely popular around the holidays, and Italian and Bordeaux wines are also highly requested, she said. Zachys' top customers tend to spend around $900 per order.\n\nAnd when it comes to what Wall Streeters want for themselves? Watches seem to be all the rage.",

    "description": "As the S&P 500 hovers near record highs, strategists shrug off concerns of an AI bubble, for now.",
    "fullText": "As stocks sit near all-time highs, strategists are brushing off concerns of an AI bubble.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) is on pace to close out the year with a gain of over 17%, powered by a 26% jump in technology stocks (XLK).\n\n“I don't see a bubble at all. However, I do believe we're going to be going into a bubble,” Sanctuary Wealth chief investment strategist Mary Ann Bartels told Yahoo Finance last week.\n\nBatels compared the current market to prior bubbles, including the late 1920s and the dot-com bubble.\n\n“We're tracking pretty similarly. In fact, it's kind of eerie how we're actually tracking that pattern,” she said. “I see a bubble occurring but not out until maybe ’29 into ’30.”\n\nBut for the time being, Sanctuary strategists forecast that tech will continue leading the market higher out into the end of the decade. They place the S&P 500 anywhere between 10,000 and 13,000 by 2030.\n\n“That's why we're calling 2026, you know, to be fearless, that there's still significant upside in this market, particularly for technology,” she said.\n\nPart of the upside comes from semiconductor stocks. Once treated as commodity plays, they become growth stocks, with Nvidia (NVDA) “basically rewriting the path for semiconductor chips.”\n\nThe AI chip powerhouse has surged over 40% so far this year, pushing its market cap to $4.6 trillion and making it the most valuable publicly traded company. On Friday, Nvidia shares rose after the company announced a $20 billion licensing deal with specialized chipmaker Groq (GROQ.PVT).\n\nThe deal was announced as the chip space has heated up, with Alphabet's Google (GOOG) making headlines with its specialized customer chips called TPUs.\n\nAlphabet stock has soared some 65% year to date.\n\nUBS strategists also expect the AI boom and robust profit growth to underpin market gains in 2026.\n\n“We note that forward price-to-earnings multiples are only marginally higher than at the start of the year, reinforcing the fact that earnings growth and not valuation bubbles have driven market gains,” wrote the strategists last week.\n\nUBS forecasts S&P 500 earnings per share to grow about 10% year over year, pushing the index to 7,700 by the end of next year.\n\nVeteran strategist Ed Yardeni also sees the index reaching 7,700 next year, with the probability of his \"Roaring 2020s\" scenario at 60%. He cited, among other reasons, tax benefits from the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" that passed this year and the AI boom.\n\nIn October, Goldman Sachs analysts argued the stock market isn’t in a bubble because tech stocks have risen mostly due to actual growth, not speculative bets. The firm noted that top-performing companies have strong balance sheets and the AI sector is still mostly led by a few big players, while most bubbles occur when many new entrants rush into a hot sector.",

    "description": "Unpaid wages nearly tripled in October from a year ago to more than $27 million.",
    "fullText": "Russia’s financial system is reportedly coming under more strain as Moscow’s war on Ukraine nears the end of its fourth full year.\n\nThe White House is seeking to revive peace talks this weekend with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky due to meet President Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday. Russian forces stepped up their bombardment of Ukraine ahead of the meeting, but prolonged fighting presents risks for the economy.\n\n“A banking crisis is possible,” a Russian official told the Washington Post recently on condition of anonymity. “A nonpayments crisis is possible. I don’t want to think about a continuation of the war or an escalation.”\n\nRussia’s economy was surprisingly resilient in the face of severe Western sanctions after President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. That’s as China and India were eager to snap up cheap Russian oil, keeping the Kremlin’s coffers full and providing revenue for its military.\n\nBut more recently, energy prices have slumped while Europe and the U.S. have tightened sanctions. Oil and gas revenue has tumbled 22% in the first 11 months of the year, and Reuters estimated that December proceeds are on pace to sink nearly 50%.\n\nTo cover the shortfall in energy revenue, Moscow has tapped its sovereign wealth fund. But that is running out now too, so the government has resorted to raising more revenue via tax hikes.\n\nMeanwhile, a tight labor market and high inflation have forced the central bank to keep interest rates high, and recent easing has failed to prevent spending declines in several consumer categories.\n\nWith companies feeling the squeeze of high rates and weaker consumption, Russian data show unpaid wages nearly tripled in October from a year ago to more than $27 million, with the Post adding that furloughs and shorter workweeks are also becoming more common.\n\nAs a result, more consumers are having trouble servicing their loans. Given the headwinds, the Russian official warning of a banking or nonpayment crisis isn’t the first of its kind.\n\nIn June, Russian banks raised red flags on a potential debt crisis as high interest rates weigh on borrowers’ ability to service loans. Also that month, the head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs warned many companies were in “a pre-default situation.”\n\nAnd in September, Sberbank CEO German Gref, one of Russia’s top banking chiefs, said the economy was in “technical stagnation,” following his warnings in July and August that growth was close to zero.",

    "fullText": "In banking, telecom, and payments, reliability is not a nice to have. It is table stakes. The most reliable systems I have worked on reduce entire classes of bugs before the code even runs. Functional programming and Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) let you push correctness into the type system, so illegal states cannot be constructed in the first place.\n\nMost production incidents are not due to complex algorithms. They are due to the code entering a state that should never have been possible. If you have been on call, you have seen variants of these:\n\nFunctional programming helps by modeling the domain with types that make invalid states unrepresentable. Pure functions and immutability keep behavior predictable and testable.\n\nProduct types combine fields, think \"and\". Sum types choose one of several cases, think \"or\". Together they model your domain rules.\n\nWith this shape, \"paypal\" cannot exist as a Payment. The compiler refuses the value.\n\nWhen you pattern match on a sum type, the compiler can force you to handle every variant. If you later add a new case, every non exhaustive match becomes a compilation error or warning. This is how refactors become safe by default.\n\nAdd a new Crypto method and both code bases will point out every place you must update.\n\nIncident story\n\nA payout worker retries on network timeouts and calls settle() twice. The table allows pending = false and settled = true twice with the same ledger id. Reconciliation finds duplicates and accounting needs a manual fix.\n\nWhy it happened\n\nState is spread across booleans and strings. The database does not express the lifecycle. The application code does, but only by convention and tests.\n\nTransitions become total functions. You can return a Result when a transition is not allowed.\n\nNow the illegal transitions are blocked by construction. Test coverage still matters, but the shape of the model prevents a class of bugs.\n\nRefactor safety\n\nWhen product adds Chargeback, the compiler highlights every match that ignores it. You cannot ship with a half handled lifecycle.\n\nEvery switch on TxnState now requires a chargeback branch. This is free guidance from the compiler.\n\nIncident story\n\nThe call detail record pipeline generates billing events whenever it sees a Connected event. Under jitter and retries, some sessions never receive Completed. The billing system charges based on the wrong boundary and customers complain.\n\nWhy it happened\n\nThe call lifecycle is implicit across many services. A connected session with no end was still billable because there was no type that separated non billable states from billable ones.\n\nNow a connected but never completed call cannot produce a billable duration. The shape forbids the bug.\n\nIncident story\n\nA cache TTL is stored in an environment variable. Someone sets CACHE_TTL_SECS=30s. In JavaScript, Number(\"30s\") yields NaN and your code treats it as zero, disabling caching in production.\n\nThe ambiguity disappears. The code must handle absence and parse errors explicitly.\n\nDo not use null to mean \"maybe\". Do not throw exceptions for expected errors.\n\nThese types make the happy path and the error path equally explicit.\n\nMutable shared state is a common source of heisenbugs under concurrency. Prefer immutable data and pure functions. When you need to update, create a new value.\n\nYour tests become simple. Given the same inputs, the function returns the same output.\n\nNumbers are not self describing. Create types that carry meaning.\n\nYou stop mixing milliseconds with seconds or dollars with cents by accident.\n\nKeep the domain logic pure and push IO to the edges. This makes unit tests cheap and fast.\n\nStart small and make continuous progress. Here is a practical order for a team new to these ideas.\n\nReplace pairs of booleans with a sum type\n\nReplace string enums with discriminated unions\n\nReplace nullable fields with Option\n\nReplace thrown control flow with Result\n\nIntroduce newtypes or branded types for units and ids\n\nPattern matching compiles to simple branches. Discriminated unions in TypeScript are just plain objects. The main cost you will feel is validation at the boundaries in smart constructors. This is a trade worth making. The compiler then protects the interior of the system.\n\nReliability is designed. With Algebraic Data Types, pattern matching, Option and Result, immutability, and smart constructors, you encode domain rules directly in your types. Illegal states cannot compile. This is why industries that cannot afford failure, such as banking and telecom, gravitate to functional ideas.\n\nIf you work on code that touches money, minutes, or public availability, adopt these patterns now.\n\nYour on call shifts will be quieter, and your users will notice the difference.",

The strategy is aimed at increasing adoption and interest in the XRP Ledger (XRPL).\n\nThis week, Asia Web3 Alliance Japan and Web3 Salon launched the Japan Financial Infrastructure Innovation Program. The initiative is designed to support Japanese startups developing next-generation, compliant digital financial solutions on the XRP Ledger.\n\nThe program opened applications on December 19 and is offering a $10,000 grant per startup. It is narrowly focused on three high-value verticals, including stablecoins, real-world asset tokenization, and credit infrastructure.\n\n\"Japan offers an overwhelming opportunity for blockchain innovation, supported by a forward-thinking regulatory framework and deep talent pool. This program represents Ripple's commitment to fostering a vibrant ecosystem where startups can leverage the speed, low cost, and reliability of the XRP Ledger to create real-world benefits and transform financial infrastructure,\" Christina Chan, Senior Director of Developer Growth at RippleX, said.\n\nAnalysts view it as a low-cost funnel for identifying candidates for Ripple’s significantly larger capital pool, including the 1 billion XRP fund dedicated to developers in Japan and Korea.\n\nThe program has secured backing from a formidable roster of establishment players, including Mizuho Bank, SMBC Nikko Securities, and Securitize Japan.\n\nDespite the initiative's high-profile corporate backing, it comes at a precarious moment for the network.

The bank has rolled out its proprietary genAI platform to over 200,000 employees. And with about 100 more tools in the pipeline, JPMorgan is seeking to reengineer workflows for everyone from coders to portfolio managers.\n\nJPMorgan has reportedly given employees the option to use its in-house AI tools to assist in writing year-end performance reviews.\n\nExecutives at America's largest bank gave an inside look at how it's training employees to use its tools and how they're using them to deliver measurable results.\n\nDimon has previously said he's out to win the AI arms race, and he thinks JPMorgan's $2 billion AI investment has already matched its cost in savings.\n\nCitigroup has also been aggressively accelerating its AI plans. Over the summer, the bank doubled down on its AI ambitions with new leadership at the helm of its tech transformation.\n\nIn mid-October, Citi CEO Jane Fraser said that nearly 180,000 employees in 83 countries have access to the bank's proprietary AI tools and have used them almost 7 million times this year.\n\nIts generative AI tools have saved 100,000 developer hours a week with automated code reviews — \"a very meaningful productivity uplift,\" she said during the firm's third-quarter earnings call.\n\nThe bank launched the pilot of agentic AI for 5,000 colleagues in September.\n\n\"It allows complex, multi-step tasks to be completed with a single prompt, and the early results are very promising, and we'll expand access to this in the months ahead,\" said Fraser. \"Finally, we have launched a firm-wide effort to systematically embed AI in our processes end-to-end to drive further efficiencies, reduce risk, and improve client experience.\"\n\nShe also highlighted several tools to help its wealth management advisors. Citi hired an AI leader from Morgan Stanley earlier this year to help revamp its wealth technology.\n\nLike JPMorgan, Citi is also telling employees to use AI for performance reviews, Fraser recently told Bloomberg in an interview.\n\nOne of Citi's top tech executives, Shadman Zafar, outlined the bank's four-phased AI strategy and how it will \"change how we work for decades to come.\"\n\nGoldman put $6 billion behind its technology spend this year, but David Solomon, the bank's CEO, said he wished it were more.\n\nHe said he would like to be at least $8 billion, but \"I can't afford it because I've got to deliver returns,\" he said at a conference in early October.\n\nA definitive statement about how AI will affect Goldman came from a memo to employees in October announcing the third iteration of the bank's cross-bank initiative OneGS. The memo said the plan would leverage AI will drive efficiency at the firm, slow hiring, and result in a \"limited reduction\" of roles.\n\nGoldman, like its peers, has been rolling out tools, including an internal AI assistant to all employees this summer.\n\nBusiness Insider talked to employees about how they were using AI.\n\nGoldman's top partners and Solomon are eager to see AI rev up their businesses. From realizing internal productivity gains to capturing more business as clients look to raise money in anticipation of AI development and acquisitions, here's what the top echelon is expecting.\n\nThere is no AI without data, and there is no data strategy at Goldman without its chief data officer, Neema Raphael. Raphael gave Business Insider an inside look at how his roughly 500-person team melds with the rest of the bank to get the most out of its data.\n\nMorgan Stanley's CFO, Sharon Yeshaya, lifted the curtain on some of the firm's progress on AI during its earnings call last month.\n\nShe highlighted DevGen.AI, a tool that, from January to June, Business Insider previously reported, had saved developers more than 280,000 hours, or 11,666 days they would have previously dedicated to deciphering outdated code.\n\nParable, an interactive tool that analyzes and summarizes data, and LeadIQ, an AI-powered lead distribution platform that matches users of its workplace and self-directed platforms to the bank's financial advisors, were also spotlighted in the call.\n\nA survey of Morgan Stanley's interns also gave a peek into just how popular and useful AI has been for the industry's youngest cohort. ChatGPT is their favorite tool by far — with 72% of Morgan Stanley's interns said they use it daily or several times a week. The bank was early to have a partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.\n\nMorgan Stanley also spoke with Business Insider about bringing employees' AI ideas to life. Here's a look at that process.\n\nBank of America's AI rollout is also well underway.\n\nThe bank's CEO Brian Moynihan says its use of AI is already embedded across the firm, from consumer banking to institutional clients. Its virtual assistant, Erica, handled 2 million customer interactions in a single day and can now answer 700 types of questions — up from 210 a year ago. Executives said they'll share more details on the bank's AI strategy at its investor day on November 5.\n\nRob Pascal, the bank's chief experience officer, previously detailed how the bank's internal-facing AI assistant helps bankers collect, record, and review client data.",

    "description": "Jeffrey Epstein's wills named figures like Larry Summers and Jes Staley as possible executors, DOJ files show.",
    "fullText": "As he planned for his death, Jeffrey Epstein listed powerful friends and associates from Wall Street as the people who would take care of his affairs.\n\nVersions of Epstein's will released Tuesday by the Justice Department featured former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, former Barclays CEO Jes Staley, and former Bear Stearns CEO Jimmy Cayne as potential executors of his estate.\n\nThe final version of Epstein's will — which was signed in August of 2019, while he was in jail awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges in Manhattan, and shortly before he killed himself — listed his longtime personal lawyer, Darren Indyke, and accountant Richard Kahn as his estate executors.\n\nThe older versions of Epstein's will were released following the passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which required the Justice Department to make its Epstein-related files public. In addition to Epstein's 2019 indictment, his associate Ghislaine Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2021 for trafficking girls to him, and in 2008, he pleaded guilty to a crime involving sexual misconduct with a minor.\n\nThe files include references to many of Epstein's powerful associates, including President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton. Inclusion in the documents isn't an indication of wrongdoing.\n\nCayne, who died in 2021, was listed as a co-executor for Epstein's estate in versions of Epstein's will signed in 2003 and 2004. Epstein worked at Bear Stearns in the 1980s, before becoming a financial advisor to billionaires Les Wexner and Leon Black.\n\nCayne's daughter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn 2012, Epstein listed Staley — who was then an executive at JPMorgan Chase — as a backup executor to his will. In 2013, Staley was promoted to co-executor status, alongside Indyke.\n\nStaley kept the position as co-executor of Epstein's will in the 2014 version as well. By then, Epstein had listed Summers as a backup executor.\n\nAn attorney for Staley didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Staley said in a 2019 letter to a UK regulator that he did not have a close relationship with Epstein.\n\nStaley stepped down as the CEO of Barclays in 2021 following an investigation into his ties with Epstein from the British bank regulator, which banned him from working in the financial industry. A UK court earlier this year upheld Staley's ban, finding that he lied about having a \"purely professional\" relationship with Epstein.\n\nSummers stepped down from his teaching post at Harvard and from his board seat at OpenAI following the release of numerous emails between him and Epstein by the House Oversight Committee last month.\n\nSteven Goldberg, a spokesperson for Summers, said in a statement that the economist was not involved in Epstein's financial life.\n\n\"Mr. Summers had absolutely no knowledge that he was included in an early version of Epstein's will and had no involvement in his financial matters or the administration of his estate,\" Goldberg said in a statement to Business Insider.\n\nEpstein also included another prominent figure in the penultimate version of his will. A draft of the will, released by the House Oversight Committee earlier this year, listed top Goldman Sachs lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler as the backup estate executor.\n\nRuemmler, through JPMorgan, declined to comment when the will was released by the House Oversight Committee earlier this month.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG/NEW YORK, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Global investors are increasing their wagers on Chinese artificial intelligence companies, betting on the next DeepSeek and seeking to diversify, with concerns growing about a speculative bubble in the sector on Wall Street.\n\nDemand for China's AI companies is also being stimulated by ​Beijing's push for tech independence. China has fast-tracked blockbuster listings of chipmakers, notably Moore Threads (688795.SS), dubbed \"China's Nvidia\", and MetaX (688802.SS), which both debuted this month.\n\nForeigners see China closing ‌the tech gap with the U.S. as Beijing steps up support for AI chipmakers, spurring bets on Chinese companies just as worries grow over lofty valuations on U.S.-listed AI stocks.\n\nU.K.-based asset manager Ruffer, for example, said it has \"deliberately limited ‌exposure\" to the Magnificent Seven - the U.S. tech giants - and is looking to add positions in Alibaba (BABA, 9988.HK) for a bigger exposure to China's AI theme.\n\n\"While the U.S. remains the leader in frontier AI, China is rapidly narrowing the gap,\" said Gemma Cairns-Smith, Investment Specialist at Ruffer. \"The moat may not be as wide, or as deep, as many think ... The competitive landscape is shifting.\"\n\nRuffer is gaining exposure to the AI theme through Chinese tech giants such as Alibaba, which operates an AI chip unit, owns large language model Qwen, and is ploughing money into cloud infrastructure.\n\nGlobal asset managers are increasingly eyeing Chinese AI firms ⁠as a wave of startups lists on the mainland and in ‌Hong Kong, seeking to tap into surging investor appetite following the meteoric rise of DeepSeek, China’s answer to ChatGPT.\n\nUBS Global Wealth Management in a report this month rated China tech as \"most attractive\", citing investors' search for geographical diversification and China's \"strong policy backing, technological self-reliance, and rapid ‍AI monetization\".\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) currently trades at 31 times earnings, compared with a multiple of 24 for Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech (HSTECH.HK), which enables AI bets via stocks including Alibaba (BABA, 9988.HK), Baidu (BIDU, 9888.HK), Tencent (0700.HK, TCEHY) and chip foundry SMIC (0981.HK).\n\nRiding the momentum, U.S. investment adviser Rayliant helped launch a Nasdaq-listed fund in September that gives investors access to \"China's versions of stocks like Google, Meta, Tesla, Apple, and OpenAI\".\n\nKraneShares Chief Investment Officer Brendan Ahern said the ​rapid ascent of Chinese AI chipmakers such as Cambricon speaks to the scale and speed of innovation across China's AI and semiconductor industries.",

    "description": "Tuesday's flurry of delayed data releases could fill in gaps in Wall Street's picture of the economy.",
    "fullText": "US stocks tipped higher on Tuesday after fresh data showed surprisingly strong growth in the US economy over the summer, leading investors to trim bets on near-term interest-rate cuts.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) both rose around 0.4%, with the benchmark index vying for a fresh record close. The blue-chip benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained around 0.2%. The turn higher came after the major gauges on Monday notched their third win in a row.\n\nGold (GC=F) and silver (SI=F) continued to pick up steam through Tuesday morning, adding to a stunning rally that has the precious metals on pace for their best year in more than four decades. At the same time, copper (HG=F) crested a fresh record above $12,000 per ton.\n\nTuesday brought a last gasp of data ahead of the Christmas holiday. Wall Street got a first look at third quarter GDP, which showed the US economy grew at a 4.3% annualized rate in the quarter. That was much higher than the 3.3% expected, a potential sign of continued economic resilience. The shutdown-delayed report also found that consumer spending remained strong over the summer.\n\nAfter the release, traders pared bets on a rate cut in January. Markets now price in over 85% odds of the Federal Reserve standing pat, up from 80% a day ago and 75% last week. That said, a plurality of wagers remain on two cuts by the end of next year.\n\nBut Tuesday morning's read on December consumer confidence from the Conference Board showed the measure declining for a fifth consecutive month, as consumers' poor economic vibes persist.\n\nWall Street stocks have rallied back in recent days, after last week's data — including a surprise drop in inflation and lukewarm look at labor market — left bets on 2026 interest-rate cuts mostly intact.\n\nOn the corporate front, Novo Nordisk's (NVO) US-listed stock jumped in premarket after the Danish drugmaker got official US approval to market its Wegovy weight-loss pill.\n\nLooking ahead, US stock markets will wrap up trading early on Wednesday and be closed all day Thursday for the Christmas holiday.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Monday that he sees room to revise the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target and move to a range-based system instead.\n\nSpeaking on the \"All-In Podcast\" on Monday, Bessent said, “Once we are back to [2%] — which I think will be in sight — then we can have a discussion: Is it much smarter to have a range?”\n\nThe US inflation target, set in 2012 at 2%, constitutes one-half of the Fed's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability, driven by maintaining a long-term stable inflation mark.\n\n10-year Treasurys (^TNX) ticked up by roughly 0.2% through the first half of Tuesday, while the Intercontinental Exchange's US Dollar index (DX-Y.NYB) moved down by the same amount.\n\nBessent's comments come after a delayed release of the November Consumer Price Index showed that prices increased by 2.7% over the year prior, compared to consensus estimates of 3.1%. So-called core\" CPI — which strips out the more volatile food and energy categories — rose by 2.6% against economist estimates of 3%.\n\nShares in US mining companies with copper (HG=F) operations are rising after the metal crested $12,000 per ton for the first time ever on Tuesday morning, setting an all-time high as President Trump's tariff policies and a string of mine accidents have roiled supply chains.\n\nFreeport-McMoRan (FCX), whose Grasberg copper mine in Indonesia was taken nearly completely offline earlier in the year after a deadly mudslide that left several workers dead, traded up by 1.4% in the first minutes after the opening bell. Fellow mining giants BHP Group (BHP) and Teck Resources (TECK) gained 0.4% and 2.5%, respectively.\n\nShares in Southern Copper (SCCO), one of the US's major copper operators, moved in the opposite direction, falling by roughly 0.4%.\n\nThe year has been strong for metals across the board. Prices on copper itself are up more than 37% year to date, while hot-rolled coil steel (HRC=F) and aluminum (ALI=F) have climbed by 32% and 17%, respectively, according to data from Trading Economics.\n\nWhile geopolitics have played a role, Trump's tariff regime has also sent copper and other metals prices soaring, dragging mining stocks along with it.\n\nWhen Trump announced plans in July to impose tariffs on copper, traders rushed to move physical copper stores out of warehouses overseas and back into the US to avoid these duties, which sent prices soaring. When the administration clarified that these tariffs would not apply to raw copper ore, prices came back down.\n\nUnder current policy, semi-finished products and copper-intensive goods, such as wiring or tubes, are covered under an identical 50% tariff, although raw copper ores are excluded. Imports of both steel and aluminum are currently subject to a 50% tariff.\n\nUS consumers remained pessimistic about the current state of the economy at the start of December, according to data from the Conference Board.\n\nThe Conference Board's consumer confidence reading dropped 3.8 points to 89.1 in December from November's upwardly revised reading of 92.9, marking the fifth month in a row that consumer confidence weakened.\n\nConsumers' views on current business conditions were negative for the first time since September 2024, the report said. Survey respondents cited ongoing concerns, such as inflation, tariffs, and politics, although other topics, including immigration, war, and personal finance, also became more salient.\n\nAt the same time, consumers' expectations for inflation 12 months from now retreated after increasing in November. Consumers also had the most positive view of where stock prices are headed a year from now since January.\n\nOverall, households reported feeling mildly negative about their family's current financial situation, but turned slightly more optimistic about future conditions. Many reported putting off big-ticket purchases, as Americans reported spending more on necessities and cheap thrills than on expensive discretionary items.\n\nCloud software maker ServiceNow (NOW) has reached an agreement to acquire the cybersecurity company Armis in a $7.75 billion deal, the company announced Tuesday morning.\n\nThe transaction, an all-cash deal that ServiceNow said it will finance with both cash on hand and debt, will be ServiceNow's largest acquisition to date, according to Bloomberg. Shares in ServiceNow fell by roughly 2.6% after the announcement.\n\nThe acquisition is intended to broaden ServiceNow's cybersecurity offerings in its cloud products, the company said in its press release. Armis' security offerings will allow enterprise customers in industries with \"cyber-physical\" assets, such as healthcare and manufacturing, to get a more real-time assessment of potential threats, ServiceNow said.\n\n\"In the agentic AI era, intelligent trust and governance that span any cloud, any asset, any AI system, and any device are non-negotiable if companies want to scale AI for the long-term,\" ServiceNow president, COO, and chief product officer Amit Zavery said.\n\n\"Together with Armis, we will deliver an industry-defining strategic cybersecurity shield for real-time, end-to-end proactive protection across all technology estates.\"\n\nUS stocks opened Tuesday's trading on unstable footing after GDP data showed stronger-than-expected growth in the US economy through the summer, leading investors to pull back from bets on near-term cuts from the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell by roughly 0.2% in the most volatile move of the morning, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ticked up by less than 0.1% each following the third win in a row for US stocks to start the week.\n\nCopper (HG=F) set a fresh record on Tuesday morning, crossing $12,000 per ton for the first time, while gold (GC=F) and silver (SI=F) continued to pick up steam, adding onto a stunning rally that has the precious metals on pace for their best year in more than four decades.\n\nBefore the opening bell on Tuesday, investors got a reading on third quarter GDP, which showed the US economy grew at a 4.3% annualized rate in the quarter, above the expected 3.3% growth. Predictions of a rate cut at the January Federal Reserve meeting fell in the aftermath, with traders pricing in only a 13% chance.\n\nUS gross domestic product (GDP) unexpectedly accelerated in the third quarter, coming in at an annualized pace of 4.3%, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported on Tuesday.\n\nEconomists had expected the initial reading of annualized growth to slow to a 3% pace from last quarter's 3.8% reading, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nThe reading showed resilience in consumer spending and exports, though investments decreased, the BEA said. Imports, which are subtracted from the calculation of GDP, also declined.\n\nEconomists have noted that the economy has looked increasingly K-shaped, with higher-income households propping up spending while lower-income households become more financially stressed.\n\nThe advance GDP reading was originally scheduled to be released on Oct. 30, with a second estimate scheduled for Nov. 26, but the data was delayed due to the government shutdown.\n\nTom Hale, the CEO of Oura, which makes the popular health tracking ring, doesn't think a new hardware device from OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) will make the Apple (AAPL) iPhone obsolete, he told Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi. Hale said it would have a long way to go to drive mass appeal.\n\n\"We've all had [Amazon] Alexa devices in our lives, and they're fascinating, ... but it's also kind of latent in the sort of bandwidth for information,\" Hale said in a new episode of Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast. \"I'm fascinated by conversations that you have with OpenAI or any of the models like Gemini. ... At the same time, it's not the perfect user interface for every kind of computing activity you might consult.\"\n\nHale added that he doesn't think the iPhone will go away, just as the iPhone didn't fully replace laptops or desktops.\n\n\"It's just another form factor for computing,\" he said. \"I think that's where the device goes, and I think that we'll have a cloud of wearables that'll be tuned to whatever your use case is.\"\n\nThe US dollar is on track to hit its weakest annual performance since 2017, according to the Bloomberg Dollar Index.\n\nAST SpaceMobile (ASTS) stock fell 3% before the bell on Tuesday, following a surge on Monday. The Starlink rival's stock closed 14% up on Monday. AST's gains follow President Trump's signing of an executive order last week to secure America's \"space superiority.\"\n\nCACI (CACI) stock edged higher on Tuesday, rising 1% during premarket trading, following the announcement on Monday that the US defense contractor will acquire space technology provider ​ARKA Group from funds managed by ‌Blackstone Tactical Opportunities for $2.6 billion.\n\nCarnival Corporation (CCL) stock rose 1% before the bell on Tuesday, following the cruise liner posting positive Q4 earnings results on Friday, beating Wall Street expectations and resuming dividend payments.\n\nMilitary shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) saw its stock rise 4% during premarket trading on Tuesday and closed 5% up in the prior day's trading after the US Navy announced it had selected Huntington to design and build a new class of warship.\n\n“We look forward to supporting the Navy on this critical program,” said Chris Kastner, HII president and CEO.\n\nPresident Trump also said on Monday that he had approved a plan for the US Navy to construct new \"Trump-class\" warships to serve as flagships for the nation's naval fleet.\n\nRivals to Huntington saw their stock close higher yesterday, such as General Dynamics (GD), which saw its shares rise almost 2% on Monday, and Australian company Austal (ASB.AX), which has a major presence in the US, saw its shares close 6% higher on Tuesday.\n\nShares of Novo Nordisk jumped before the bell on Tuesday after the FDA approved its weight-loss pill on Monday.\n\nThe green light for oral Wegovy gives the Danish drugmaker a boost as looks to claw back ground lost to US rival Eli Lilly (LLY). Novo has seen a rocky 2025 of sliding shares, profit warnings, and slowing sales of its injectable Wegovy amid intensifying competition, including from compounded versions.",

    "fullText": "Before he ever worked in finance, Cardinez thought he'd play professional football. When that didn't happen, he found a way to remain close to the action — interning at Madison Square Garden, joining the 2014 Super Bowl host committee, and completing the NFL's rotational program across media, business development, and strategy.\n\nHe thought he'd stay there and ascend the ranks. But he decided on a different path that seemed to align more with his interests: finance.\n\nAfter earning his MBA and working in investment banking, he joined Blue Owl's HomeCourt Partners, a fund established with the NBA to buy minority stakes in teams.\n\nCardinez has since worked on multiple franchise deals, including the Phoenix Suns' $4 billion sale and a 2024 transaction involving the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nKress' path to high finance began in academic research, studying anthropology and psychology at Notre Dame and conducting fieldwork in Sierra Leone before pursuing graduate work on Angola's energy sector at the University of Oxford. She later worked at political research and consultancy firm, Eurasia Group, training investors to integrate geopolitical risk into decision-making.\n\nKress came to BlackRock first as an advisor to Tom Donilon, the former US national security advisor, a post she called a \"dream job.\" She helped Donilon elevate the firm's geopolitics function into a permanent part of the BlackRock Investment Institute.\n\nBut she didn't stop there. This year, Kress was named the chief of staff to Larry Fink, the firm's powerful CEO. She told Business Insider that this new job was the \"culmination\" of her career, offering \"unparalleled exposure\" to global policymakers and business leaders.\n\nJack Levendoski, JPMorgan Chase\n\nLevendoski grew up all over the world — from Louisiana to London, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Australia — before beginning his career as a facilities engineering project manager at Chevron.\n\nIn that role, he supported offshore oil and gas work in the Gulf of Mexico. Levendoski later moved into investment banking and is now an executive director in JPMorgan's M&A group, advising on high-profile technology and software transactions.\n\nMenasche admits he didn't always feel like a natural fit for the finance industry — he didn't grow up in a household of bankers, he said, and he studied chemistry and math at Cambridge. But after trying academic research, he found the lab's pace too slow. That realization led him to roles that blended analytical work with more day-to-day momentum, eventually steering him into secondaries.\n\nToday, Menasche is a managing director and global cohead of Goldman Sachs' private capital and liquidity solutions group, working across real estate, infrastructure, private equity, and venture capital transactions.\n\nJackie Shepherd, Morgan Stanley\n\nBefore joining the ranks of Wall Street, Shepherd spent years competing in Division I golf, earning a full-ride scholarship and captaining the University of Minnesota's team. She began her career in accounting at EY's international tax practice, where she first encountered investment banking.\n\n\"I didn't realize that there was an intersection between the two,\" she told Business Insider. \"I wanted to be the person coming up with more of the cool ideas.\" So she made the pivot to Wall Street.\n\nAfter holding roles at Goldman Sachs and Citi, she joined Morgan Stanley's separations and structured solutions group. Shepherd has worked on roughly $250 billion in transactions, including Comcast's pending carve-out of its cable networks.\n\nGolf, she said, remains a key part of her life, adding that aspires to play on all seven continents.",

    "fullText": "I missed Hanukkah, and I'm cutting it close on Christmas, but I've finally got my holiday wish list in order.\n\nI'm not looking for new sneakers or some cool electronics. This year's requests focus on the business world. (Santa Claus is a BI Today subscriber, obviously.)\n\nROI for AI. I'm legally required to start every 2025 recap or 2026 look-ahead by mentioning artificial intelligence. This isn't about bashing or praising AI, though. I just want to see some noticeable returns on all these massive AI projects. I'm not screaming about an AI bubble, but my palms get a little sweaty thinking about the ever-growing tech budgets. So, give us all some relief by showing that these AI tools are going to generate revenue.\n\nA solution to Wall Street's recruiting cycle. The worst thing that could happen to a junior banker is finding out their favorite Murray Hill brunch spot has shut down. The second-worst thing happened this year when big banks fought back against PE's early recruitment of them. The result upended a Wall Street tradition aspiring financiers had spent years preparing for. I was never a fan of the process, but the change left us in a weird no-man's land where none of the rules are apparent.\n\nPrediction markets predict their future. With a string of recent media partnerships, we're going to see a lot more data from prediction markets in 2026. Meanwhile, some state regulators aren't so pleased with their rise. So let's settle the debate. I'd like prediction markets to set a market speculating on their own future. Let the people decide!\n\nNo more media blackouts, please. I can't go through another two weeks of no sports because of carriage disputes. I know how this story ends (the customer paying more), and I also know there's nothing I can do about it. So just rip the bandage off, and let's avoid the grandstanding going forward.\n\nProtein, chill out. No food group is on a hotter run than the muscle-building nutrient. But it's flying too close to the sun. We've got protein in hot cocoa now?? I'm a self-admitted gym bro, and I know my whey around a protein shake (I hate myself for that joke), but even I need to put my foot down. Besides, overconsumption of protein could have a painful conclusion for some of us: kidney stones.\n\nThe New York Knicks to reach the NBA finals. I'm not even asking for a title!\n\nThe New York Jets to play a meaningful game in December. Even Santa has his limits",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame said the US needs to shift away from \"power-hungry\" chips, but Nvidia has a \"death grip\" on the sector.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry says Nvidia is pushing the idea that building graphics chips that consume more and more power is the best path to advancing AI — and the result could be the US losing the AI race to China.\n\n\"Exactly and sadly,\" Burry wrote on X late Saturday, responding to another user's comment that called Nvidia the \"gangster of the AI neighborhood\" as it has \"shut down any narrative that even hints at reducing GPU demand.\"\n\nIn another post over the weekend, Burry shared a chart showing China has more than double America's electric generation capacity, and is expanding its energy infrastructure at a much faster rate.\n\nWhy China will win AI in one chart. \n\nPower hungry Nvidia chips are not the way forward for the U.S. \n\nIt is not just the total power advantage. It is the slope. pic.twitter.com/qNXh1e4lZj\n\nNvidia has framed AI innovation as \"just figuring out how to power and to cool bigger, hotter silicon,\" Burry said. But China's huge lead in building out power sources means companies in the US are \"plowing capital into a race it is structurally positioned to lose.\"\n\nBurry said the US needs to shift its focus from developing more and more \"power hungry\" chips toward advancing \"AI-tuned ASICs\" — application-specific integrated circuits that are designed to do a particular task quickly and efficiently.\n\nBut he said Nvidia has a \"death grip on development\" thanks to its deals with many key players in the AI industry.\n\nNvidia did not immediately reply to a request for comment from Business Insider about Burry's posts.\n\nNvidia stock has surged more than 12-fold since the start of 2023, making it the world's most valuable public company, with a market capitalization of $4.4 trillion.\n\nThe chipmaker raked in about $148 billion of revenue and $77 billion of net income in the first nine months of this year. \"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in the third-quarter earnings release.\n\nBurry, whose contrarian bet against the US housing bubble was chronicled in the book and movie \"The Big Short,\" recently pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack.\n\nHe has made the case to his readers that Nvidia and other AI companies are inflating a historic tech bubble. He has said that Nvidia's customers have exaggerated the lifespan of its chips to drag out depreciation and boost short-term earnings.\n\nBurry has also called out the \"give-and-take\" deals between Nvidia and chip buyers such as OpenAI and Oracle, and criticized Nvidia's stock-based compensation as excessive.\n\nNvidia previously responded to his critiques in a memo to Wall Street analysts that was quickly leaked. Burry fired back that the document featured \"one straw man after another\" and he stood by his analysis.\n\nReplying to a subsequent comment on his Substack, Burry wrote that Nvidia had \"become too much of a focus.\" While the company's response did make him \"think to look a little deeper,\" he said it was a \"relatively small short\" for him.\n\n\"I believe it will fall, and is a pure play on my overall thesis, but it is not the worst out there.\"",

Investors have just become choosier about which players might emerge as winners heading into 2026.\n\nTech (XLK) stocks have been on a rollercoaster recently as concerns over funding for Oracle (ORCL) data centers and construction delays from CoreWeave (CRWV) rattled AI plays.\n\n\"I do believe these are all hyper-valid concerns for the theme, and with the market now breaking out the 'scrutiny scalpel' we are finally seeing appropriate 'winners and losers' dispersion, and that's a good thing,\" Nomura Securities equity derivatives analyst Charlie McElligott wrote in a note on Thursday.\n\nHowever, Micron Technology's (MU) blockbuster results sparked a rebound in AI trades. The memory chipmaker beat Wall Street estimates on Q1 revenue and EPS, helped by AI-fueled demand.\n\nMcElligott compared Micron's earnings' \"upside shock\" to Nvidia's (NVDA) results in May 2023, which acted as a catalyst for the broader AI boom.\n\n\"Point-being, there is still blood left in this AI stone,\" McElligott wrote.\n\nInvestors have been watching for potential funding risks within the AI trade after Oracle stock fell following a Financial Times report that Blue Owl Capital would not support Oracle's $10 billion data center project.\n\nThe concerns are particularly notable given the market concentration among the largest tech companies in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts forecast S&P 500 earnings growth of over 12% in 2026, largely driven by the top seven stocks in the index. Those include Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Broadcom (AVGO), and Meta (META). Together, they account for roughly a quarter of the index's earnings.\n\nMeanwhile, the \"Magnificent 7\" tech players are up an average of 21% this year, compared with a 16% gain for the S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\nSevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye told Yahoo Finance he expects to see winners and losers within the group heading into next year.\n\n\"I think we're going to see some pretty massive bifurcation,\" Essaye said.\" The next evolution of this trade, where there are going to be winners and losers within the Mag 7.\"\n\nHe said that his favorite stock is Alphabet because of the growth prospects for Google's Gemini artificial intelligence product.\n\n\"I think companies like Oracle that are not overextended financially, but are sort of raising eyebrows with a lot of the spending that AI, I think that companies like that could struggle,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "Palantir (PLTR) trades at 552 times trailing earnings and 175 times forward earnings. Bank of America set a $255 price target.\n\nMichael Burry bought $9.2 million in Palantir put options at a $50 strike price expiring in 2027.\n\nPalantir maintains a 50% free cash flow margin with full-year FCF estimated at $2.1 billion.\n\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nMichael Burry has been butting heads with the bulls on Wall Street, specifically regarding Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR). The bulls have won big so far, and the price targets have gotten even bolder. On the other hand, most analysts are sitting on the fence with a \"Hold\" rating, with three analysts having \"Sell\" ratings on the stock. There are four \"Strong Buy\" ratings, with the highest price target at $255, from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).\n\nBurry believes PLTR stock may be on the cusp of an implosion, with his bearish thesis focusing on the sky-high valuation of the stock. PLTR stock trades at 156 times trailing sales and at 552 times trailing earnings. It still trades at 175 times next year's expected earnings, which is an unprecedented valuation that no other big tech stock has seen since the Dot Com era.\n\nThis may be old news by now, but it's worth a refresher before we get to the meat.\n\nBurry holds put options on approximately 5 million Palantir shares, with a notional value of around $912 million. This is the largest bearish bet in his portfolio and constitutes 66% of his reported holdings. The true amount involved is much lower. Burry himself posted on X, saying that he spent $9.2 million buying 50,000 put options on Palantir.\n\nThese options expire in 2027 at a strike price of $50. Burry is betting that PLTR stock will decline well below $50, allowing him to sell higher at the strike price when it expires.\n\nRegardless, this is a drop in the bucket compared to how much Burry's spending power. The notional value did lead to dramatic headlines and lured in comments from Palantir CEO Alex Karp, who called Burry \"batshit crazy\" during an interview.\n\nThe bulls' argument is essentially that Palantir is an extraordinary company that deserves an extraordinary valuation. It has managed to grow significantly after getting its foot in the door at any company/agency. What truly makes this growth special is that the company has a free cash flow margin of nearly 50%. For a company believed to be early on in its growth cycle, Palantir is truly exceptional.",

    "fullText": "MarketsBy Srinivasan SivabalanSaveEmerging markets are poised to start 2026 as a favored trade on Wall Street, with money managers betting a multi-year cycle of investment inflows is underway.This year’s capital rush into the sector — the best since 2009 across all emerging-market securities — is a sign more investors are allocating to a sector that’s been out of favor after years of lackluster performance. For the first time since 2017, emerging stocks are outperforming US peers, the gap between its bond yields and those of US Treasuries have shrunk to the lowest in 11 years and carry trade strategies — which largely consist of borrowing in a lower-yielding asset to fund purchases in higher-yielding ones — have reaped the best profits since 2009.",

    "fullText": "We're in the thick of the holiday season, and that can only mean one thing on Wall Street: Blackstone's annual holiday video is out.\n\nThe tongue-in-cheek video leans into the private equity shop's 40th anniversary with a mocking tribute to its 1980s origins. It riffs on everything from Ken Burns-style narration, including an abrupt firing of Burns himself in favor of some \"pizzazz,\" to execs dancing their way through \"Dirty Dancing\"-style choreography.\n\nExecutives portraying the firm's mid-life crisis include one who wears a nose ring and others who want to buy sports teams or Ferrari (the company). Cameos include actor Danny DeVito pitching jargon-filled investment products, as well as Goldman Sachs CEO (and side-hustling DJ) David Solomon.\n\nThe seven-and-a-half-minute video concludes with Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman and President Jon Gray in a parody of the \"Back to the Future\" movie.\n\nBlackstone is no stranger to quirky holiday videos. In fact, this was their 8th in a row (see where this year's video lands in BI's power ranking).\n\nYou might be wondering: Why does Blackstone spend so much time, effort, and money on such a thing, especially when few other financial firms do? Apollo produced its own holiday video in 2022, but this year the private-equity firm appears to have pivoted to publishing.\n\nBlackstone produced its first holiday video in 2018 as a replacement for its New York holiday party, as the firm had grown too large. Earlier this month, at a conference, Gray said the video was a way for the world's largest private investor to \"make fun of ourselves.\"\n\nBlackstone's video ends on a poignant note in memory of Wesley LePatner, a Blackstone executive who was killed in the tragic summer shooting at the firm's NYC headquarters. The video said she \"always made us smile.\"",

    "description": "Sergio Avedian started his career as a Wall Street trader before becoming a rideshare driver. Now, he makes videos for The Rideshare Guy on YouTube.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sergio Avedian, a 58-year-old ride-hailing driver for Uber and Lyft in Southern California. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was born in Istanbul, Turkey, to Armenian parents. I went to high school in Germany and later came to the US for college.\n\nI was always interested in finance, so I ended up becoming a trader at a boutique Wall Street firm. I saw the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. After I retired from my day job in 2005, I was looking for things to keep myself occupied. Algorithms fascinated me because I had seen widespread automation in the world of finance.\n\nIn 2016, I was getting lunch with a friend who was telling me about this app called Uber. My friend said, \"I think they use algorithms.\" Curiosity got the better of me, and I started reading about it and meeting drivers to learn more. Eventually, I signed up as a driver myself in the Los Angeles area.\n\nBack then, Uber was offering $1,000 bonuses to sign up as a driver. I also earned up to $80 an hour.\n\nBut what really intrigued me were the parallels with trading. On Wall Street, we used to say that \"a trend is your friend\" because you could make money if you caught one early enough.\n\nPicking ride-share trips was like that. You had to know when and where trip prices would surge. That meant, for example, I had to position myself in Santa Monica between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., because prices would usually be higher there at that time.\n\nI've also spent the last several years writing articles for and making videos with Harry Campbell, who has a YouTube channel called The Rideshare Guy. I've been working with Harry since about 2018, with a break during COVID when demand for rides went down.\n\nI think Uber, Lyft, and the other gig work apps are wonderful. They've created massive opportunities for people. But I also don't want the people who make these services work each day to get left behind. The people who do this work need to start saving for their future.\n\nThat's why my latest project is a personal finance website and YouTube channel. It's not just for gig workers, but they're a big part of the audience. They don't have access to the same benefits that employees do, such as retirement benefits.\n\nOne piece of advice I've been giving drivers: At the end of your shift, do one extra trip, then put the money from that trip in an account and don't touch it. You can even put it in an index fund or another investment that will appreciate over time.\n\nDrivers need to think about investing more than ever, given how self-driving cars are expanding.\n\nI'm exploring the creation of an investment trust to own some of these cars — similar to a REIT that owns malls — that drivers can also invest in. I want them to have skin in the game and earn some passive income.\n\nI also put together a petition asking Uber and Lyft to pay their drivers a one-time \"Thank you\" bonus.\n\nBoth companies have made lots of money, especially over the last few years. Uber became profitable thanks to efforts such as upfront pricing, and Lyft has made a turnaround. Uber announced a $20 billion stock buyback program this year. Why can't we make drivers' lives better and create a sense of loyalty with a one-time payment like this?\n\nI've spoken to the CEOs of these companies because of my work for The Rideshare Guy, so I know they'll listen. Will they actually do it?\n\nOne thing I've learned in my time in the rideshare community is that the companies can do the right thing. In 2023, I worked with Pablo Gomez, another driver in Los Angeles, to get California's treasurer to update some of the reimbursement rates under Prop 22 — the state's pay law for gig workers — which led Uber to pay millions of dollars to drivers.\n\nIf Pablo hadn't mentioned that issue to me, I'd have had no clue about it, and we might have never gotten it fixed.\n\nI want to open the door for some different ideas about how we can benefit drivers.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "Palm Beach is buzzing with Wall Street energy this winter. Here's our insider guide to the hotspots.",
    "description": "Wall Street arrived in Palm Beach early this winter. From Milos to Mary Lou's, these restaurants and nightlife spots are leading the scene.",
    "fullText": "Ask me about the ZIP code 33480, and I'll have plenty to say.\n\nIt's Palm Beach, a place I know well. I grew up in South Florida, and even now, I spend a good amount of time here, watching how the island continues to evolve. It also happens to overlap with my job: as a Wall Street reporter, many of the firms we cover — from Goldman Sachs to Citadel — have built out significant \"Wall Street South\" operations in and around Palm Beach County over the past few years.\n\nThis winter, locals tell me the island feels especially busy — noticeably earlier than usual. Restaurants are filling up weeks ahead of the holidays, reservations are disappearing quickly, and the finance crowd is playing a noticeable role, restaurant insiders say.\n\n\"We've never seen the island this full this early in the season,\" Alex Melillo, a partner at Mary Lou's, one of West Palm's newest and hottest nightlife venues, told me.\n\nTo get a broader sense of where people are actually going, I asked around. In addition to speaking with restaurant operators and longtime denizens of \"the Island,\" I checked in with some local contacts in finance: a money manager who works for a large bank and a trusted friend who works in private asset management.\n\nIn my conversations, the same names kept coming up — places where Wall Streeters, finance professionals, and winter visitors congregate when they're here.\n\nI recently had a meal at Buccan and wasn't disappointed. Unlike many popular Palm Beach hot spots that lean old-world, the space feels particularly modern, matching the restaurant's more cosmopolitan approach to dining.\n\nThe menu is built around avant-garde plates meant for sharing, with dishes that change seasonally but often include standouts like hamachi tiradito, inventive crudos, and rich pastas.\n\nWhen I went with a friend, we split the sweet corn agnolotti — and it's an absolute must. The room draws a lively mix of locals and visiting professionals, and it's the kind of place where dinners tend to stretch. Next door is Imoto, Buccan's sister restaurant, a sleek sushi spot if you're craving Japanese.\n\nCucina is often the first stop when my friends and I are looking for a fun night out.\n\nIt's Palm Beach's playground, an island favorite for seeing and being seen — and a place that tends to extend a simple dinner into a much longer affair when the music comes on. Specialized lights illuminate the ceiling in keeping with the DJ's beat. Tables feel like prime real estate, and the room gets even more packed as the evening goes on.\n\nOn busy nights, it's clear this is where a large cross-section of Palm Beach society — including professionals from out of town — has descended. The door can be selective, but once you're inside, the expectation is that you'll stay awhile and dance. I recommend stopping by Lola 41 around the corner for a drink first.\n\nEstiatorio Milos opened earlier this year on the West Palm Beach waterfront, bringing one of the most respected names in Mediterranean seafood to South Florida. The restaurant has the same bright, luminous aesthetic found at other Milos locations — including Hudson Yards — with fresh fish displayed on ice and a glowing bar that makes an ideal backdrop for conversation on a buzzy night.\n\nAside from Avra in Sunny Isles, this may be the best Greek restaurant in South Florida right now. A must-order for the table is the Milos chips — paper-thin zucchini and eggplant, lightly fried and genuinely impossible to resist — alongside simply prepared whole fish grilled with lemon and olive oil.\n\nIf you're craving a taste of Manhattan — or Paris — in Palm Beach, La Goulue has become one of the island's most popular destinations. The South Florida offshoot of the classic Upper East Side French restaurant serves familiar staples like cheese soufflé, lobster bisque, and rich French onion soup, drawing a steady mix of locals and winter visitors.\n\nIt's rarely quiet. \"I was passing by La Goulue the other day, and there wasn't an empty seat,\" said Daphne Nikolopoulos, editor in chief of Palm Beach Illustrated, a popular glossy title in the area. The restaurant has become a dependable choice for everything from long family dinners to client meals — the kind of place finance and business guests return to repeatedly once they're settled in town for the season.\n\nAn Upper East Side mainstay that opened in Palm Beach in 2021, Le Bilboquet has become a dependable stop for winter visitors looking for a taste of home. The French bistro serves its signature dishes — including cajun chicken, tuna tartare, and Dover sole — in a setting that works just as well for long lunches as for leisurely dinners.\n\nThe restaurant has been especially busy this season. \"We're certainly seeing a strong presence from the finance and business community this winter,\" a spokesperson for the restaurant told me. They said they've also seen an increase in group meals and celebrations, \"including more corporate and business dinners, often with groups of eight to 10 guests,\" tied to end-of-year and holiday gatherings.\n\nIf you're interested in a memorable night out, Mary Lou's, which opened this year to much fanfare, is arguably the area's hottest ticket. Inside, you'll find a space that's dark and sultry, anchored by a dramatic chandelier over the bar and a massive disco ball overhead. Visiting celebrities often pass through, tucked into the discrete banquettes along the wall.\n\nMelillo, one of Mary Lou's three partners, said the season has ramped up earlier than usual, driven in large part by visiting finance and corporate guests who are spending longer stretches in Palm Beach and going out more frequently. For Wall Streeters and the local professional crowd, the environment feels inviting but still upscale. Expect to see well-dressed partiers in sport jackets and toasting with free-flowing libations.\n\nJoe Cervasio, the partner who oversees programming, said the venue has leaned into booking touring DJs and festival-level talent as demand has grown.\n\n\"I cannot hold enough champagne — it's literally falling through our fingertips,\" Melillo said.\n\nReservations are strongly recommended.\n\nOne of the most talked-about openings on Palm Beach Island this season is The Polo Room, the new restaurant led by internationally known polo player Nacho Figueras. The menu is inspired by the legendary polo star's Argentinian roots.\n\nNot to be mistaken for an offshoot of a separate restaurant — Ralph Lauren's Polo Bar on 55th Street in Midtown — the space opened in early December and has quickly drawn attention from locals and winter visitors. It features an equestrian aesthetic throughout.\n\n\"Without question, The Polo Room is fantastic,\" said Nikolopoulos, who was one of the new restaurant's first customers. \"Figueras doesn't do anything halfway — he's meticulous and very professional with all his endeavors.\"\n\nShe said the food stood out, pointing to the empanadas and steaks in particular, and noted that Figueras has incorporated family recipes into the menu — like his mom's signature chocolate mousse for dessert.",
