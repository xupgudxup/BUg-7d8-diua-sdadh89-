    "fullText": "MarketsBy Jeran WittensteinSaveIt’s been three years since OpenAI set off euphoria over artificial intelligence with the release of ChatGPT. And while the money is still pouring in, so are the doubts about whether the good times can last.From a recent selloff in the shares of Nvidia Corp., to Oracle Corp.’s plunge after reporting mounting spending on AI, to souring sentiment around a network of companies exposed to OpenAI, signs of skepticism are increasing. Looking to 2026, the debate among investors is whether to rein in AI exposure ahead of a potential bubble popping or double down to capitalize on the game-changing technology.",

    "fullText": "Canada is coming up with ways to put its stockpiled American liquor to good use.\n\nSeveral provinces in the country halted imports of US booze and removed it from store shelves in March in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nNow, at least four provinces are planning to sell the remaining inventory and donate proceeds to food banks.\n\nCanada's far eastern province, Prince Edward Island, told Business Insider that its government will put its stock of American booze, which it had pulled off the shelves, back in stores starting on December 11.\n\nA representative for the province's finance department said the government anticipates profits of $600,000 Canadian dollars, or about $434,000, from the sale. The proceeds will be distributed to food banks across the island. The province says it does not intend to place any further orders for American alcohol.\n\nThe finance office of Newfoundland and Labrador told Business Insider it had made an upfront payment of $500,000 on Tuesday to 60 provincial food banks before the sales of any liquors, a move that will help more than 15,400 people. After the liquor is sold, more donations will go to the food banks for a total sum of up to $1 million.\n\nManitoba and Nova Scotia have similar plans.\n\nManitoba said it will sell its inventory through private retailers and restaurants, with the estimated $500,000 in net revenue going to food banks, holiday charities, children's organizations, and an advocacy group for First Nations.\n\nAs for Nova Scotia, the province is making a $4 million upfront payment to groups that provide food access, and the money will be recouped when the $14 million worth of liquor is eventually sold.\n\n\"We will not be ordering any more from the United States once this inventory is gone,\" the province's premier, Tim Houston, said in a statement. \"But Nova Scotians have already paid for this product.\"\n\nHe added, \"We don't want it to go to waste. That's why we're selling it and using the proceeds to help those in need.\"\n\nIn Canada, the sale of alcohol is mainly controlled by provincial governments, each of which establishes a board to oversee the matter. Only Alberta has a completely privatized alcohol retail system, while Saskatchewan has a partially privatized system.\n\nCanada mainly imports whiskey and bourbon, alongside beer and other spirits, from the US.\n\nA spokesperson for Ontario's finance ministry told Business Insider that the province had no plans to put the booze on store shelves soon.\n\n\"US alcohol will remain off shelves and is being held in storage until further notice,\" said the spokesperson. \"We are currently exploring options for the products.\"\n\nOntario did not disclose how much inventory it still has, but the province said the inventory it had pulled off the shelves in March was worth around C$80 million.\n\nA government representative from the Northwest Territories and a spokesperson of the British Columbia Liquor Distribution Branch both told Business Insider that they ceased US liquor imports in March, but will continue selling the stockpiled products until they are depleted.\n\nA Yukon government cabinet representative said Yukon has the same plan.\n\nHowever, the mountainous province of Alberta continues to import and sell American booze.\n\n\"In June this year, Alberta lifted restrictions on the purchase of US alcohol from American companies, signalling a renewed commitment to open and fair trade with our largest partner,\" a spokesperson of Service Alberta and Red Tape Reduction told Business Insider.\n\nThe matter of US booze has been fueling the trade tension between the two neighbors.\n\nThe animosity started when Trump imposed a 25% tariff on Canada in March and commented that Canada should become a state of the US.\n\nDespite later walking back some of his broader tariffs and upholding a previous agreement that ensured most goods remain tariff-free, Trump's moves have drawn the ire of Canadians, who have canceled travel plans and boycotted American goods in stores.\n\nAccording to the Distilled Spirits Council, US spirits exports to Canada plummeted 85% in the second quarter of 2025, falling below $10 million in export value.\n\n\"We hope both the US and Canada can address their respective concerns,\" said Chris Swonger, the CEO of the council. \"And that our products can return to Canadian retail shelves as soon as possible.\"\n\nIn March, Kentucky's bourbon makers said Canada's ban on American alcohol would hurt them.\n\nEric Gregory, the president of the Kentucky Distillers' Association, said in March that retaliatory tariffs would have \"far-reaching consequences across Kentucky, home to 95% of the world's bourbon.\"",

    "description": "Bloated valuations and an aging bull market are two things that could hold back the S&P 500 for the next decade, forecasters say.",
    "fullText": "A dark thought is starting to circulate around Wall Street. What if, after years of stellar gains, the US stock market is basically flat for the next decade?\n\nThat feels like an unbelievable idea given the current bull run for the stock market, which is just the latest in a larger secular rally that's been going on for almost 15 years.\n\nThe gains continued to pile up on Thursday. As investors fled tech amid worries about Oracle's earnings, they pumped the benchmark S&P 500 and the Dow to fresh record highs.\n\nBut the possibility of the party soon coming to an end is being floated by a growing number of forecasters, who see two main reasons the market could be held back:\n\nNow, more analysts see what could be a lost decade coming for stocks — a 10-year period where the US market sees near-zero returns or severely lags other markets around the world.\n\nIn a note this week, Bank of America said its team of equity strategists saw the S&P 500 shedding 0.1% over the next decade. Historically, that's a terrible performance, given that the S&P 500 has gained an average 10.5% a year since the 1950s.\n\nStrategists pointed to high valuations and back-to-back years of double-digit growth in the benchmark index.\n\n\"Even for next year, the math of history is tough: average returns for the S&P 500 after 3 years of >15% growth are 2.3ppt lower than the average annual return. Investors may need GDP & EPS surprises to avoid a seventh 'lost decade,'\" BofA wrote in a client note.\n\nTorsten Sløk, the chief economist at Apollo, also said he expects the S&P 500 to remain relatively flat for the next 10 years. That projection is based on where the forward price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 currently resides, he said on Thursday.\n\n\"The historical relationship between the S&P 500 forward P/E ratio and subsequent 10-year annualized returns shows that investors should expect to get zero in return in the S&P 500 over the coming decade,\" Sløk said.\n\nIn November, Goldman Sachs analysts said they saw the US market coming in last place for returns in the coming 10-year stretch. The S&P 500 is on track to gain around 6.5% a year for the next 10 years, the bank estimated, falling short of estimated returns in Europe, Japan, Asia, and emerging markets.\n\nThe bank said it expected earnings growth to be stronger in other markets. Valuations in the US are also high and on track to decline around 1% annually over the next decade, per Goldman's analysis.\n\n\"If the profitability and/or valuations of the largest companies falter, unless another cohort of 'superstars' emerges, returns for the broad market will likely be hampered as today's largest stocks fall back to earth,\" analysts wrote of their bearish scenario for the US market.",

    "description": "Michael Burry pointed to the Fed's plan to start purchasing short-term Treasurys as a sign of weakness in the banking system.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry thinks he's spotted another sign of trouble in the US financial system.\n\nThe famed investor of \"The Big Short\" said he was eyeing one comment in particular that came out the Fed's meeting on Wednesday. That's the mention that the FOMC believes the Fed's reserve balances had declined to \"ample levels\" — and that the central bank would start making \"reserve management purchases.\"\n\nIt's a jargony way of saying the Fed will start purchasing short-term US Treasurys \"on an ongoing basis,\" per the committee's statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\nPurchasing short-term T-bills — which the Fed will start doing on December 12 and total around $40 billion a month — is one way the central bank can boost liquidity in markets and the banking sector. It's slightly different from quantitative easing, which is when the Fed purchases long-term Treasurys to stimulate the economy by keeping a lid on borrowing costs. However, in the short term, it has a similar effect of boosting the amount of money circulating through the financial system, making it easier for banks to meet their reserve requirements.\n\nBut the fact that the Fed has to provide that support at all is a worrying sign, in Burry's view. The Fed's reserve balances currently hover around $2.8 trillion, according to the latest weekly data from the central bank.\n\n\"I would add if the US banking system can't function without $3+ trillion in reserves/life support from the Fed, that is not a sign of strength but a sign of fragility,\" Burry wrote in a post on X Wednesday evening. \"So I'd say US Banks are getting weaker way too fast.\"\n\nStocks surged after the Fed's policy meeting, largely fueled by optimism about the central bank's plan to purchase short-term Treasury bills, JPMorgan's market intelligence team wrote in a note.\n\nThe purchase of short-term Treasurys marks the first time the Fed has meaningfully expanded its balance sheet since it ended its quantitative easing prgram in 2022, analysts at Deutsche Bank said.\n\n\"Seems that after every crisis now the Fed needs to expand its balance sheet permanently or guarantee a bank funding crisis. No wonder stocks are doing well,\" Burry said, adding that he was avoiding bank stocks and choosings to keep his money in cash accounts or Treasury money market funds.\n\n\"Rip QT; long live 'reserve management purchases,'\" he added.\n\nBurry, who correctly called the subprime mortgage crisis, has cemented his reputation as a permabear in recent years. Since returning to social media this year, he has repeatedly sounded the alarm on a stock market bubble, unveiled fresh bets against AI titans like Nvidia, and warned about the huge amounts of spending by the biggest tech companies.",
