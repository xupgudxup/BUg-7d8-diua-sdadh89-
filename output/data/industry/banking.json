    "title": "'Big Short' investor Michael Burry warns the US will lose the AI race to China if it banks on Nvidia's 'power hungry' chips",
    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame said the US needs to shift away from \"power-hungry\" chips, but Nvidia has a \"death grip\" on the sector.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry says Nvidia is pushing the idea that building graphics chips that consume more and more power is the best path to advancing AI — and the result could be the US losing the AI race to China.\n\n\"Exactly and sadly,\" Burry wrote on X late Saturday, responding to another user's comment that called Nvidia the \"gangster of the AI neighborhood\" as it has \"shut down any narrative that even hints at reducing GPU demand.\"\n\nIn another post over the weekend, Burry shared a chart showing China has more than double America's electric generation capacity, and is expanding its energy infrastructure at a much faster rate.\n\nWhy China will win AI in one chart. \n\nPower hungry Nvidia chips are not the way forward for the U.S. \n\nIt is not just the total power advantage. It is the slope. pic.twitter.com/qNXh1e4lZj\n\nNvidia has framed AI innovation as \"just figuring out how to power and to cool bigger, hotter silicon,\" Burry said. But China's huge lead in building out power sources means companies in the US are \"plowing capital into a race it is structurally positioned to lose.\"\n\nBurry said the US needs to shift its focus from developing more and more \"power hungry\" chips toward advancing \"AI-tuned ASICs\" — application-specific integrated circuits that are designed to do a particular task quickly and efficiently.\n\nBut he said Nvidia has a \"death grip on development\" thanks to its deals with many key players in the AI industry.\n\nNvidia did not immediately reply to a request for comment from Business Insider about Burry's posts.\n\nNvidia stock has surged more than 12-fold since the start of 2023, making it the world's most valuable public company, with a market capitalization of $4.4 trillion.\n\nThe chipmaker raked in about $148 billion of revenue and $77 billion of net income in the first nine months of this year. \"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in the third-quarter earnings release.\n\nBurry, whose contrarian bet against the US housing bubble was chronicled in the book and movie \"The Big Short,\" recently pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack.\n\nHe has made the case to his readers that Nvidia and other AI companies are inflating a historic tech bubble. He has said that Nvidia's customers have exaggerated the lifespan of its chips to drag out depreciation and boost short-term earnings.\n\nBurry has also called out the \"give-and-take\" deals between Nvidia and chip buyers such as OpenAI and Oracle, and criticized Nvidia's stock-based compensation as excessive.\n\nNvidia previously responded to his critiques in a memo to Wall Street analysts that was quickly leaked. Burry fired back that the document featured \"one straw man after another\" and he stood by his analysis.\n\nReplying to a subsequent comment on his Substack, Burry wrote that Nvidia had \"become too much of a focus.\" While the company's response did make him \"think to look a little deeper,\" he said it was a \"relatively small short\" for him.\n\n\"I believe it will fall, and is a pure play on my overall thesis, but it is not the worst out there.\"",

    "fullText": "The AI tech trade isn't over. Investors have just become choosier about which players might emerge as winners heading into 2026.\n\nTech (XLK) stocks have been on a rollercoaster recently as concerns over funding for Oracle (ORCL) data centers and construction delays from CoreWeave (CRWV) rattled AI plays.\n\n\"I do believe these are all hyper-valid concerns for the theme, and with the market now breaking out the 'scrutiny scalpel' we are finally seeing appropriate 'winners and losers' dispersion, and that's a good thing,\" Nomura Securities equity derivatives analyst Charlie McElligott wrote in a note on Thursday.\n\nHowever, Micron Technology's (MU) blockbuster results sparked a rebound in AI trades. The memory chipmaker beat Wall Street estimates on Q1 revenue and EPS, helped by AI-fueled demand.\n\nMcElligott compared Micron's earnings' \"upside shock\" to Nvidia's (NVDA) results in May 2023, which acted as a catalyst for the broader AI boom.\n\n\"Point-being, there is still blood left in this AI stone,\" McElligott wrote.\n\nInvestors have been watching for potential funding risks within the AI trade after Oracle stock fell following a Financial Times report that Blue Owl Capital would not support Oracle's $10 billion data center project.\n\nThe concerns are particularly notable given the market concentration among the largest tech companies in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts forecast S&P 500 earnings growth of over 12% in 2026, largely driven by the top seven stocks in the index. Those include Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Broadcom (AVGO), and Meta (META). Together, they account for roughly a quarter of the index's earnings.\n\nMeanwhile, the \"Magnificent 7\" tech players are up an average of 21% this year, compared with a 16% gain for the S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\nSevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye told Yahoo Finance he expects to see winners and losers within the group heading into next year.\n\n\"I think we're going to see some pretty massive bifurcation,\" Essaye said.\" The next evolution of this trade, where there are going to be winners and losers within the Mag 7.\"\n\nHe said that his favorite stock is Alphabet because of the growth prospects for Google's Gemini artificial intelligence product.\n\n\"I think companies like Oracle that are not overextended financially, but are sort of raising eyebrows with a lot of the spending that AI, I think that companies like that could struggle,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "Palantir (PLTR) trades at 552 times trailing earnings and 175 times forward earnings. Bank of America set a $255 price target.\n\nMichael Burry bought $9.2 million in Palantir put options at a $50 strike price expiring in 2027.\n\nPalantir maintains a 50% free cash flow margin with full-year FCF estimated at $2.1 billion.\n\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nMichael Burry has been butting heads with the bulls on Wall Street, specifically regarding Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR). The bulls have won big so far, and the price targets have gotten even bolder. On the other hand, most analysts are sitting on the fence with a \"Hold\" rating, with three analysts having \"Sell\" ratings on the stock. There are four \"Strong Buy\" ratings, with the highest price target at $255, from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).\n\nBurry believes PLTR stock may be on the cusp of an implosion, with his bearish thesis focusing on the sky-high valuation of the stock. PLTR stock trades at 156 times trailing sales and at 552 times trailing earnings. It still trades at 175 times next year's expected earnings, which is an unprecedented valuation that no other big tech stock has seen since the Dot Com era.\n\nThis may be old news by now, but it's worth a refresher before we get to the meat.\n\nBurry holds put options on approximately 5 million Palantir shares, with a notional value of around $912 million. This is the largest bearish bet in his portfolio and constitutes 66% of his reported holdings. The true amount involved is much lower. Burry himself posted on X, saying that he spent $9.2 million buying 50,000 put options on Palantir.\n\nThese options expire in 2027 at a strike price of $50. Burry is betting that PLTR stock will decline well below $50, allowing him to sell higher at the strike price when it expires.\n\nRegardless, this is a drop in the bucket compared to how much Burry's spending power. The notional value did lead to dramatic headlines and lured in comments from Palantir CEO Alex Karp, who called Burry \"batshit crazy\" during an interview.\n\nThe bulls' argument is essentially that Palantir is an extraordinary company that deserves an extraordinary valuation. It has managed to grow significantly after getting its foot in the door at any company/agency. What truly makes this growth special is that the company has a free cash flow margin of nearly 50%. For a company believed to be early on in its growth cycle, Palantir is truly exceptional.",

It riffs on everything from Ken Burns-style narration, including an abrupt firing of Burns himself in favor of some \"pizzazz,\" to execs dancing their way through \"Dirty Dancing\"-style choreography.\n\nExecutives portraying the firm's mid-life crisis include one who wears a nose ring and others who want to buy sports teams or Ferrari (the company).

In fact, this was their 8th in a row (see where this year's video lands in BI's power ranking).\n\nYou might be wondering: Why does Blackstone spend so much time, effort, and money on such a thing, especially when few other financial firms do? Apollo produced its own holiday video in 2022, but this year the private-equity firm appears to have pivoted to publishing.\n\nBlackstone produced its first holiday video in 2018 as a replacement for its New York holiday party, as the firm had grown too large. Earlier this month, at a conference, Gray said the video was a way for the world's largest private investor to \"make fun of ourselves.\"\n\nBlackstone's video ends on a poignant note in memory of Wesley LePatner, a Blackstone executive who was killed in the tragic summer shooting at the firm's NYC headquarters.

    "description": "Sergio Avedian started his career as a Wall Street trader before becoming a rideshare driver. Now, he makes videos for The Rideshare Guy on YouTube.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sergio Avedian, a 58-year-old ride-hailing driver for Uber and Lyft in Southern California. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was born in Istanbul, Turkey, to Armenian parents. I went to high school in Germany and later came to the US for college.\n\nI was always interested in finance, so I ended up becoming a trader at a boutique Wall Street firm. I saw the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. After I retired from my day job in 2005, I was looking for things to keep myself occupied. Algorithms fascinated me because I had seen widespread automation in the world of finance.\n\nIn 2016, I was getting lunch with a friend who was telling me about this app called Uber. My friend said, \"I think they use algorithms.\" Curiosity got the better of me, and I started reading about it and meeting drivers to learn more. Eventually, I signed up as a driver myself in the Los Angeles area.\n\nBack then, Uber was offering $1,000 bonuses to sign up as a driver. I also earned up to $80 an hour.\n\nBut what really intrigued me were the parallels with trading. On Wall Street, we used to say that \"a trend is your friend\" because you could make money if you caught one early enough.\n\nPicking ride-share trips was like that. You had to know when and where trip prices would surge. That meant, for example, I had to position myself in Santa Monica between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., because prices would usually be higher there at that time.\n\nI've also spent the last several years writing articles for and making videos with Harry Campbell, who has a YouTube channel called The Rideshare Guy. I've been working with Harry since about 2018, with a break during COVID when demand for rides went down.\n\nI think Uber, Lyft, and the other gig work apps are wonderful. They've created massive opportunities for people. But I also don't want the people who make these services work each day to get left behind. The people who do this work need to start saving for their future.\n\nThat's why my latest project is a personal finance website and YouTube channel. It's not just for gig workers, but they're a big part of the audience. They don't have access to the same benefits that employees do, such as retirement benefits.\n\nOne piece of advice I've been giving drivers: At the end of your shift, do one extra trip, then put the money from that trip in an account and don't touch it. You can even put it in an index fund or another investment that will appreciate over time.\n\nDrivers need to think about investing more than ever, given how self-driving cars are expanding.\n\nI'm exploring the creation of an investment trust to own some of these cars — similar to a REIT that owns malls — that drivers can also invest in. I want them to have skin in the game and earn some passive income.\n\nI also put together a petition asking Uber and Lyft to pay their drivers a one-time \"Thank you\" bonus.\n\nBoth companies have made lots of money, especially over the last few years. Uber became profitable thanks to efforts such as upfront pricing, and Lyft has made a turnaround. Uber announced a $20 billion stock buyback program this year. Why can't we make drivers' lives better and create a sense of loyalty with a one-time payment like this?\n\nI've spoken to the CEOs of these companies because of my work for The Rideshare Guy, so I know they'll listen. Will they actually do it?\n\nOne thing I've learned in my time in the rideshare community is that the companies can do the right thing. In 2023, I worked with Pablo Gomez, another driver in Los Angeles, to get California's treasurer to update some of the reimbursement rates under Prop 22 — the state's pay law for gig workers — which led Uber to pay millions of dollars to drivers.\n\nIf Pablo hadn't mentioned that issue to me, I'd have had no clue about it, and we might have never gotten it fixed.\n\nI want to open the door for some different ideas about how we can benefit drivers.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "Palm Beach is buzzing with Wall Street energy this winter. Here's our insider guide to the hotspots.",
    "description": "Wall Street arrived in Palm Beach early this winter. From Milos to Mary Lou's, these restaurants and nightlife spots are leading the scene.",
    "fullText": "Ask me about the ZIP code 33480, and I'll have plenty to say.\n\nIt's Palm Beach, a place I know well. I grew up in South Florida, and even now, I spend a good amount of time here, watching how the island continues to evolve. It also happens to overlap with my job: as a Wall Street reporter, many of the firms we cover — from Goldman Sachs to Citadel — have built out significant \"Wall Street South\" operations in and around Palm Beach County over the past few years.\n\nThis winter, locals tell me the island feels especially busy — noticeably earlier than usual. Restaurants are filling up weeks ahead of the holidays, reservations are disappearing quickly, and the finance crowd is playing a noticeable role, restaurant insiders say.\n\n\"We've never seen the island this full this early in the season,\" Alex Melillo, a partner at Mary Lou's, one of West Palm's newest and hottest nightlife venues, told me.\n\nTo get a broader sense of where people are actually going, I asked around. In addition to speaking with restaurant operators and longtime denizens of \"the Island,\" I checked in with some local contacts in finance: a money manager who works for a large bank and a trusted friend who works in private asset management.\n\nIn my conversations, the same names kept coming up — places where Wall Streeters, finance professionals, and winter visitors congregate when they're here.\n\nI recently had a meal at Buccan and wasn't disappointed. Unlike many popular Palm Beach hot spots that lean old-world, the space feels particularly modern, matching the restaurant's more cosmopolitan approach to dining.\n\nThe menu is built around avant-garde plates meant for sharing, with dishes that change seasonally but often include standouts like hamachi tiradito, inventive crudos, and rich pastas.\n\nWhen I went with a friend, we split the sweet corn agnolotti — and it's an absolute must. The room draws a lively mix of locals and visiting professionals, and it's the kind of place where dinners tend to stretch. Next door is Imoto, Buccan's sister restaurant, a sleek sushi spot if you're craving Japanese.\n\nCucina is often the first stop when my friends and I are looking for a fun night out.\n\nIt's Palm Beach's playground, an island favorite for seeing and being seen — and a place that tends to extend a simple dinner into a much longer affair when the music comes on. Specialized lights illuminate the ceiling in keeping with the DJ's beat. Tables feel like prime real estate, and the room gets even more packed as the evening goes on.\n\nOn busy nights, it's clear this is where a large cross-section of Palm Beach society — including professionals from out of town — has descended. The door can be selective, but once you're inside, the expectation is that you'll stay awhile and dance. I recommend stopping by Lola 41 around the corner for a drink first.\n\nEstiatorio Milos opened earlier this year on the West Palm Beach waterfront, bringing one of the most respected names in Mediterranean seafood to South Florida. The restaurant has the same bright, luminous aesthetic found at other Milos locations — including Hudson Yards — with fresh fish displayed on ice and a glowing bar that makes an ideal backdrop for conversation on a buzzy night.\n\nAside from Avra in Sunny Isles, this may be the best Greek restaurant in South Florida right now. A must-order for the table is the Milos chips — paper-thin zucchini and eggplant, lightly fried and genuinely impossible to resist — alongside simply prepared whole fish grilled with lemon and olive oil.\n\nIf you're craving a taste of Manhattan — or Paris — in Palm Beach, La Goulue has become one of the island's most popular destinations. The South Florida offshoot of the classic Upper East Side French restaurant serves familiar staples like cheese soufflé, lobster bisque, and rich French onion soup, drawing a steady mix of locals and winter visitors.\n\nIt's rarely quiet. \"I was passing by La Goulue the other day, and there wasn't an empty seat,\" said Daphne Nikolopoulos, editor in chief of Palm Beach Illustrated, a popular glossy title in the area. The restaurant has become a dependable choice for everything from long family dinners to client meals — the kind of place finance and business guests return to repeatedly once they're settled in town for the season.\n\nAn Upper East Side mainstay that opened in Palm Beach in 2021, Le Bilboquet has become a dependable stop for winter visitors looking for a taste of home. The French bistro serves its signature dishes — including cajun chicken, tuna tartare, and Dover sole — in a setting that works just as well for long lunches as for leisurely dinners.\n\nThe restaurant has been especially busy this season. \"We're certainly seeing a strong presence from the finance and business community this winter,\" a spokesperson for the restaurant told me. They said they've also seen an increase in group meals and celebrations, \"including more corporate and business dinners, often with groups of eight to 10 guests,\" tied to end-of-year and holiday gatherings.\n\nIf you're interested in a memorable night out, Mary Lou's, which opened this year to much fanfare, is arguably the area's hottest ticket. Inside, you'll find a space that's dark and sultry, anchored by a dramatic chandelier over the bar and a massive disco ball overhead. Visiting celebrities often pass through, tucked into the discrete banquettes along the wall.\n\nMelillo, one of Mary Lou's three partners, said the season has ramped up earlier than usual, driven in large part by visiting finance and corporate guests who are spending longer stretches in Palm Beach and going out more frequently. For Wall Streeters and the local professional crowd, the environment feels inviting but still upscale. Expect to see well-dressed partiers in sport jackets and toasting with free-flowing libations.\n\nJoe Cervasio, the partner who oversees programming, said the venue has leaned into booking touring DJs and festival-level talent as demand has grown.\n\n\"I cannot hold enough champagne — it's literally falling through our fingertips,\" Melillo said.\n\nReservations are strongly recommended.\n\nOne of the most talked-about openings on Palm Beach Island this season is The Polo Room, the new restaurant led by internationally known polo player Nacho Figueras. The menu is inspired by the legendary polo star's Argentinian roots.\n\nNot to be mistaken for an offshoot of a separate restaurant — Ralph Lauren's Polo Bar on 55th Street in Midtown — the space opened in early December and has quickly drawn attention from locals and winter visitors. It features an equestrian aesthetic throughout.\n\n\"Without question, The Polo Room is fantastic,\" said Nikolopoulos, who was one of the new restaurant's first customers. \"Figueras doesn't do anything halfway — he's meticulous and very professional with all his endeavors.\"\n\nShe said the food stood out, pointing to the empanadas and steaks in particular, and noted that Figueras has incorporated family recipes into the menu — like his mom's signature chocolate mousse for dessert.",

    "title": "Airlines are cracking down on power banks. Here's how you can avoid adding to the growing number of lithium battery accidents on planes.",
    "description": "Incidents involving lithium batteries are getting more common, so airlines are getting stricter about power banks due to the fire risk.",
    "fullText": "In late January, an Airbus A321 was running 20 minutes behind schedule as it prepared to taxi at Gimhae International Airport in Busan, South Korea.\n\nThen, a fire broke out in an overhead bin.\n\nThe inflatable slides were deployed as all 176 people evacuated the Air Busan plane, although 27 of them were injured. The aircraft was destroyed by the flames.\n\nAuthorities later said the fire was likely caused by a power bank after its insulation broke down.\n\nSince then, 2025 has seen such devices come under sharp focus for aviation safety.\n\nPower banks, laptops, and phones are all powered by lithium batteries. They pose a fire risk due to a process called thermal runaway: If the battery is damaged or overcharged, it can spark a chain reaction and a rapid rise in temperature.\n\nTwo weeks after the incident in Busan, South Korea's transport ministry announced a ban on storing power banks and e-cigarettes in the overhead bins. It also said they could no longer be charged using a plane's USB ports.\n\nSeveral airlines around the world have also introduced similar rules this year.\n\nThat includes Southwest Airlines, which did so in late May. One day later, a smoking battery charger caused a Southwest flight to divert an hour into its journey from Baltimore to Tampa.\n\nBut while the Air Busan fire appears to have prompted the wider crackdown, incidents involving lithium batteries had already become more common.\n\nAs of mid-December, the Federal Aviation Administration has recorded 80 verified incidents this year, and 89 in 2024. Before the pandemic, there were no more than 50 in any year.\n\nThat means it's gone from happening less than once a week to around every four days on average.\n\nOne reason such incidents have become more common is simply that more people own more electronic devices.\n\nHowever, airlines appear to be particularly concerned about power banks.\n\nThe growing market means that many of them are cheaply made and not properly certified. They may also lack the advanced circuitry that helps stop laptops and phones from overcharging.\n\nRising incident numbers prompted the FAA to issue a safety alert in early September. It recommended that airlines review their firefighting processes and their safety messages to passengers.\n\nThat includes educating travelers and ensuring their devices are kept visible and accessible.\n\nThis means that smoke or a fire can be spotted more quickly than if the device were in an overhead bin.\n\nEven if you're flying with an airline that hasn't mandated it, it's safer to make sure your device is visible while in use, so flight attendants can react if anything goes wrong.\n\nAirline crews are well-trained in dealing with fires. Incidents recorded by the FAA this year have seen flight attendants handle smoking power banks with specialized containment bags, fire extinguishers, and by submerging them in water.\n\nIf you notice your power bank swelling, hissing, or smelling like chemicals, stop using it immediately.\n\nAustralian airlines are the latest to introduce new rules, taking effect in mid-December.\n\nIt follows a July incident where a power bank caught fire in the overhead bin of a Virgin Australia flight. The plane landed safely, though one person was treated for smoke inhalation.\n\nAnd in November, around 150 people were evacuated from a Qantas lounge at Melbourne Airport when a man was burned by a power bank that caught fire in his pocket.\n\nWhile Southwest Airlines is so far the only major US carrier to tighten its power bank rules, other incidents indicate a heightened awareness.\n\nThis fall, two transatlantic United Airlines flights U-turned after a passenger dropped their laptop down the side of their seat and into the cargo hold.\n\nSince the devices were inaccessible, crews might not have known if they had caught fire until it was too late. That's especially risky while flying over an ocean with nowhere to land, so they diverted out of an excess of caution to retrieve the laptops.\n\nTraveling by air has only become the safest form of transport since regulators have learned from different incidents over the years.\n\nUPS Airlines suffered its first fatal crash in 2010, when a fire broke out on board a Boeing 747 shortly after departing Dubai.\n\nFlight 6 was carrying more than 80,000 lithium batteries, which ignited. Thick smoke entered the flight deck, obscuring the pilots' vision, and the captain passed out. With fire-damaged controls, the first officer was unable to direct the plane back to the airport.\n\nIn their final report, investigators made 36 safety recommendations. Regulators imposed stricter rules on how lithium batteries could be packaged and shipped, and banned them as cargo on passenger flights.\n\nIn 2012, the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization reinforced its existing ban on spare lithium batteries from checked baggage. The following year, it made clear that power banks also fall under this category.\n\nAs power banks continue to start smoking on flights, and since the FAA's safety alert, it's likely that more airlines will tighten their rules.",

    "fullText": "A storied Wall Street law firm that hemorrhaged talent after bending the knee to President Donald Trump has announced plans to merge with a much larger firm in a bid to save its practice.\n\nCadwalader, Wickersham & Taft had been actively looking for a merger partner after many of its top attorneys left over the firm’s decision to pledge $100 million in pro bono work to support the president’s priorities, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nLast spring, the president signed a series of executive orders stripping attorneys from certain firms of their security clearances, limiting their access to government buildings, and terminating government contracts with the firms.\n\nWhile some firms like Cadwalader made deals with the administration to avoid a similar punishment, others fought the orders and won big in court, adding to the humiliation of the capitulating firms.\n\nIn the wake of the firm’s deal with Trump, key partner groups at Cadwalader, which was founded in 1792 and is Wall Street’s oldest firm, quickly began making lateral moves to other practices, Above the Law reported.\n\nThe firm, which brings in about $638 million in annual revenue, is now merging with Hogan Lovells, which brought in nearly $3 billion last year, more than quadruple the size of Cadwalader, according to Above the Law.\n\nHogan Lovells’ chief executive, Miguel Zaldivar Jr., will lead the combined firm, according to the Journal. Cadwalader’s current co-managing partners will be relegated to the new firm’s management committee.\n\nPartners at both firms still need to vote to finalize the merger next year.\n\nThe deal is being described as the legal industry’s largest-ever merger, creating a $3.6 billion megafirm with more than 3,000 lawyers, according to the Journal.\n\nHogan Lovells is headquartered in London and Washington, D.C.\n\nCommenting on the merger, Zaldivar said Wall Street had long been the firm’s “missing piece,” telling the Journal, “We felt that we needed to consolidate our position with a strong finance practice in New York.”\n\n“It’s a deal that makes perfect sense,” he added.\n\nDespite being burned by its prior dealings with Trump, Cadwalader co-managing partner Pat Quinn reaffirmed the company’s commitment to pro bono legal work in a statement shared by Reuters.\n\nHowever, he declined to say whether the firm’s previous deal with the administration would apply to the merged firm.\n\nLast year, another famous Wall Street firm, Shearman & Sterling, merged with Allen & Overy to create a $3.4 billion business. Chicago-based firm Winston & Strawn also announced plans on Monday to merge with U.K. practice Taylor Wessing in 2026.",

    "description": "Bank of America was among the first to flag a \"run-it-hot\" scenario for the US economy, defined by robust growth and above-target inflation.",
    "fullText": "The US economy will keep burning hot in 2026, extending a yearslong run of dodging a recession.\n\nThat's a view that is increasingly being woven into consensus forecasts on Wall Street, where top researchers have generally brushed off the risks of a near-term recession and are anticipating another year of stable economic growth and hot inflation.\n\nBank of America dubbed this the \"run-it-hot\" scenario for the US economy back in September, and others have since adopted the phrase.\n\nIn its year-ahead economic outlook, BofA said it believes growth will remain strong and inflation will stay above target next year, pointing to tailwinds such as the Fed's rate cuts, AI investment, more supportive trade policy, and stimulus in President Donald Trump's Big Beautiful Bill.\n\n\"Tariff cuts, tax cuts, rate cuts…'run-it-hot' US policy, implicit guarantee economy & stocks 'too big to fail,'\" a team of analysts led by Michael Hartnett wrote in a separate client note this fall.\n\nMorgan Stanley strategists also unveiled their \"run it hot\" investment thesis heading into 2026, pointing to the Fed's rate-cutting cycle and the central bank's recent announcement that it would begin reserve management purchases.\n\nGoldman Sachs said it also saw economic growth remaining robust in 2026, thanks to the Fed cutting rates in a non-recessionary macro environment.\n\n\"Despite stagnant job growth, we expect policy rate cuts to limit labour market weakness and help extend the economic cycle further,\" Goldman said, though it noted that valuations in the stock market are already \"hot.\"\n\nHere's how the forecasters think investors should position themselves in a \"run it hot\" market.\n\nCommodities are the top run-it-hot trade heading into next year, Bank of America strategists wrote in a note in December.\n\nOil and energy are also favorable investments under the run-it-hot regime, they added.\n\n\"Trump runs it hot, oil bounces post Russia-Ukraine fix, China keeps yuan cheap, soon all the commodity charts will look like gold,\" strategists wrote. \"We say long commodities the best 'run it hot' trade in '26, and long despised oil/energy without question the best 'run-it-hot' contrarian trade.\"\n\nCyclical assets — which, by definition, tend to do well when the economy is expanding — are likely to benefit from the macro picture next year, Goldman Sachs said.\n\nThe bank pointed to areas like housing and consumer-facing sides of the market, which include consumer discretionary and retail stocks.\n\n\"After a patch of worry in November, cyclical assets—including cyclical equities and copper—have been rallying again. But even after these recent moves, we think our more optimistic growth views are not fully reflected in markets,\" the bank wrote.\n\nMorgan Stanley thinks consumer discretionary goods investments fall into the \"run it hot\" investing playbook. The bank noted that firms generally have higher pricing power today, which should boost revenue growth.\n\nThat dynamic is already playing out in the discretionary goods sector, strategists said. The rate for top-line earnings beats in the sector for the third quarter clocked in at 6%, above the 2% rate for the overall S&P 500, per Morgan Stanley's analysis.\n\nSmall-cap stocks also look attractive, with earnings and pricing power in the sector poised to accelerate heading into next year, Morgan Stanley added.\n\n\"On the earnings front, the two most important aspects of our constructive call are the return of (1) positive operating leverage and (2) pricing power. This combination is especially impactful for the small cap earnings recovery we foresee into 2026,\" the bank's strategists added.\n\nForecasters at Bank of America and Goldman Sachs have also issued bullish calls on small-cap stocks heading into 2026, largely because valuations in the sector are more attractive than in areas such as mega-cap tech stocks.",

    "title": "All 8 Blackstone holiday videos ranked",
    "description": "Blackstone's holiday video has become a cringe-inducing tradition on Wall Street for eight years. Here are the ones worth watching.",
    "fullText": "Blackstone released its 2025 holiday video on Thursday — the latest installment in a tradition that began in 2018 as a way to liven up employees' spirits in lieu of the holiday party, which was canceled because the firm had grown too large.\n\nSince then, the video has become a viral sensation. Eight million people viewed 2023's video showing Blackstone's executives fumbling in their efforts to be more like Taylor Swift — the same year the Daily Mail wondered whether it might be \"the most cringeworthy corporate video ever.\"\n\nWatching — and poking fun at — the video is now a Wall Street tradition, making Jay Gillespie, Blackstone's head of video, a hot commodity at 345 Park Avenue.\n\n\"People come up to me throughout the year, and they're like, 'My daughter is helping me rehearse so I might get a line next year,'\" Gillespie told Business Insider in 2024. \"People are really into lobbying to be in it.\"\n\nIf you don't get it, don't worry. We decided to help readers save time by watching and reviewing all of the firm's videos going back to 2018.\n\nThis video was released in December 2020, during the peak of the pandemic. It stuck to the theme it launched in 2018 of depicting Blackstone as a version of the NBC sitcom \"The Office,\" but executives wore face masks and pandemic jokes featured prominently. In an early scene, one Blackstone executive struggles to recognize a colleague with unmanageably long hair. (Remember when all the barber shops were closed?)\n\nWhile it was a bleak time, the video ends on an upbeat note, with Blackstone employees cutting loose to \"I'm Walking on Sunshine,\" kicking off a tradition of holiday video songs that has featured prominently since. Still, it's somewhat stuck in the pandemic era, hence its placement at No. 7.\n\nThe conceit of this holiday season is a fake news station, \"BX TV News,\" prompting Jon Gray to search for Blackstone's secret sauce. (It was a roundabout way for the firm to tout its plan to hit $1 trillion assets under management, which it has since achieved.)\n\nSchwarzman returns to a role he often plays in these videos, that of the sincere elder statesman, to explain that the firm's true secret sauce is its employees. However, he notes that a secret is hidden in the basement, setting two executives on an Indiana Jones-style quest to find the scroll containing the firm's secret. This weird twist is the highlight of the video.\n\nThe video effectively makes several self-deprecating jokes about Blackstone's love of acronyms (BCRED, anyone?) and Wall Street's notorious work hours. By 2022, however, the company had been going with \"The Office\" theme for four years, hence its ranking.\n\nThe budget for the holiday video clearly increased this year, with a storyline about the birth of BX TV, the firm's weekly video call that Gray is incredibly enthusiastic about (and employees, less so). There are animals, special effects, and a Reese Witherspoon cameo.\n\nThe key joke is a fake award ceremony where Gray receives \"Best Weekly Internal Zoom Call at an Alternative Asset Management firm.\" The hope is that it will convince the firm's president and chief operating officer that it's time to move on with John Finley, chief legal officer, saying, \"I make one call to the FCC, and they'll cancel this clown car.\"\n\nEmployees chant \"end it\" and celebrate, thinking Gray has decided to cancel the show after winning the award. It quickly becomes clear that the 2022 BX TV season is already being planned, and the internal video call remains a weekly requirement at the firm.\n\nScranton, Pennsylvania, is a long way from Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, and Dunder Mifflin would be among its smallest portfolio companies, yet Blackstone successfully riffed off the NBC sitcom \"The Office\" for its first annual holiday video. The video begins with the theme music from the television show, and like \"The Office,\" there is hand-held camera work and plenty of \"candid\" interviews with executives. There's also a Michael Scott look-alike. As with all the holiday videos that follow, this one starts with Jon Gray calling his executive assistant, Laurie Carlson.\n\nThis video started it all and set the tone for Blackstone's trademark style of mixing the firm's reality with jokes. The premise of the video is that Blackstone canceled its holiday party and replaced it with a video, which actually happened. And Jon Gray really does, sometimes, act a bit like Michael Scott in his enthusiasm for wild ideas, according to people who know him. There are fewer visual gags and no Hollywood cameos, but it's a classic.\n\n2023's holiday video marked the first time Blackstone moved away from being a parallel version of \"The Office\" (only the title card remains). Instead, it's an homage to Taylor Swift and the Eras tour, with Blackstone trying to replicate her success with its own song about alternative investments.\n\nThis is the video that broke into the wider world, spawning mocking tabloid headlines. But for a video series whose main goal is to help the firm laugh at itself, that's a measure of success. Add that this immortal line: \"Just this once, I do hope people confuse us with BlackRock.\" Also, you get to see Steve Schwarzman dancing while wearing a glittery fringe top.\n\nThis year, Blackstone turned 40 years old, so it was only right that the firm lived out its midlife crisis in front of all of us. The birthday celebration begins with a Ken Burns documentary about the firm's origins, before Jon Gray asks for Burns to be fired in favor of some \"pizzaz.\"\n\nBlackstone's execs are all dealing with their age in different ways: wearing nose rings and buying sports teams or Ferrari (the company). Steve Schwarzman's ambition to become a DJ leads to a cameo by actual DJ and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon.\n\nAnother cameo from Jersey Mike's spokesperson Danny DeVito is a highlight, with his contract apparently requiring him to take on the challenging job of advertising \"non-listed, semi-liquid, institutional-quality perpetual products.\"\n\nThe video ends with a musical number, this time an age-appropriate 80s theme, alongside a dizzying array of 80s references and an executive pulling off the iconic Dirty Dancing lift. After a challenging year for the firm's employees, this year the firm leaned into embarrassing itself and having fun.\n\nThe 2019 holiday video revolves around Blackstone's absurd search for a company mascot, which turns out to be Mr. Stone, a mascot that looks like a cross of Hulk and Jon Gray. The international offices of Blackstone get cameos in this one, as does a plug for Steve Schwarzman's book, \"What It Takes: Lessons in the Pursuit of Excellence.\"\n\nGray told BI that this was his favorite in the series because of the mascot. The firm not only hired a company to build the mascot suit, but also made dozens of bobbleheads, which still show up in holiday videos and on some people's desks. We agree that the mascot joke is a highlight.\n\nThis video also ends with one of the best Steve Schwarzman gags of the series, when it's revealed that Schwarzman has been the mysterious person inside Mr. Stone the whole time.\n\nIn 2024, the firm leaned into the cringe with a metaverse-like exploration of Blackstone executives as reality television stars, culminating in a country song-and-dance routine.\n\nIt features appearances from famous friends. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, which was originally part of Blackstone before spinning out in the 1990s, makes a joke about how the two firms are often confused for each other.\n\nGray last year told Business Insider that the turn to country was inspired by Beyonce's own embrace of the genre on \"Cowboy Carter.\"And just like Beyonce, some of the firm's best work comes when they don't let the critics stop them.\n\nJeffrey Cane contributed to previous year's rankings.",

    "fullText": "LONDON, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Major banks including JPMorgan, UBS and Citigroup on Thursday won their bid to block a 2.7 billion-pound ($3.6 billion) mass ​lawsuit over alleged foreign exchange rigging.\n\nPhillip Evans, a former inquiry chair at ‌Britain's Competition Markets Authority, was leading the case on behalf of thousands of asset managers, pension funds ‌and financial institutions.\n\nThe lawsuit, which was also brought against Barclays, MUFG and NatWest, was based on findings made by the European Commission, which fined banks more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in 2019.\n\nSome of the world's biggest investment banks have paid more than ⁠a combined $11 billion in fines ‌to settle U.S., British and European regulatory allegations that traders manipulated currency rates for years.\n\nEvans' case was initially blocked in 2022 ‍by the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), which refused to certify it on an opt-out basis, meaning members of the claimant class would be part of the case unless they decided otherwise.\n\nThe CAT said ​the case could be brought on an opt-in basis, though it accepted that ‌would effectively end the litigation.\n\nEvans' case was revived by the Court of Appeal in 2023, but the banks' appeal was upheld by the United Kingdom's Supreme Court on Thursday.\n\nJudge Vivien Rose said the Competition Appeal Tribunal \"was right to assess the merits of the claim as weak\".\n\nShe added that some members of the claimant class may ⁠have a viable claim, but they had shown ​no interest in pursuing it and represented \"a tiny ​fraction\" of the case's value.\n\nUBS and MUFG welcomed the ruling. JPMorgan and Barclays declined to comment. Citi and NatWest did not immediately ‍respond to a request ⁠for comment.\n\nEvans said in a statement that he would consider \"what options remain available to pursue justice for those affected\".\n\n\"The practical reality is that opt-in proceedings ⁠are unlikely to deliver meaningful redress for the tens of thousands of ordinary individuals and businesses ‌affected by the banks' unlawful conduct,\" he said.",

    "description": "Manhattan federal prosecutors have charged Tricolor execs Daniel Chu and David Goodgame of scheming to defraud banks and private credit lenders.",
    "fullText": "Founder Daniel Chu and the company's Chief Operating Officer David Goodgame, who were arrested and charged with bank fraud and wire fraud on Wednesday, planned to frighten at least one lender into a favorable deal, prosecutors allege. According to the indictment, the executives discussed telling a lender that the company might otherwise implode, much like the energy trading firm Enron in 2001, if a deal wasn't reached. This would be bad for the lender because it would put them at risk of losing everything.\n\n\"Enron obviously has a nice ring to it, right?\" Chu said when discussing with other Tricolor executives how to deal with one particular lender who had figured out the double-pledging issue.\n\n\"I mean, Enron, Enron raises the blood pressure of the lender when they see that. It, it has to, right?\" Chu said while laughing, documents show.\n\nIt's just one of several recorded conversations that emerged as part of a newly unsealed indictment against Chu and Goodgame. The indictment accused the men of orchestrating a years-long scheme to defraud banks and other private credit providers.\n\nChu is expected to be presented in a Florida court on Wednesday. Goodgame should be presented in a Texas court on Thursday. The men could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nTricolor rocked the banking industry when it filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September, leaving lenders like JPMorgan, Fifth Third Bank, and Jefferies exposed.\n\nAt the time of the company's September 10 bankruptcy, its largest lenders were owed more than $900 million \"as a result of the fraudulent double-pledging and collateral manipulation schemes\" orchestrated by Chu and supported by Goodgame, the feds said.\n\nBut that didn't stop Chu from using company money to enrich himself, according to prosecutors. They said Chu directed another executive to pay him the final installments of a $15 million bonus as the company approached bankruptcy, resulting in two payments from Tricolor totaling $6.25 million. Chu then used some of this money to purchase a multimillion-dollar property in Beverly Hills, California — weeks before Tricolor filed for Chapter 7, the feds said.\n\nThe back-to-back bankruptcies of Tricolor and auto parts company First Brands have raised questions about the health of the credit market, prompting JPMorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon to tell investors that he has his \"antenna\" up.\n\n\"When you see one cockroach, there's probably more,\" Dimon said on the bank's third-quarter earnings call with analysts.",

    "fullText": "Howard \"Howie\" Rubin, a once-prominent Salomon Brothers investment banker featured in the 1985 Wall Street expose \"Liar's Poker,\" must remain in a federal jail in Brooklyn indefinitely as he fights sex-trafficking charges, a judge ruled on Wednesday.\n\nIt was the third bail denial for Rubin, accused of paying women, many of them former Playboy models, $5,000 to engage in \"fetish play,\" then constraining and torturing them, including by electrocuting them against their will.\n\nMagistrate Judge Peggy Kuo said her main concern is the risk that the wealthy financier, who has a $70 million account based in the Cayman Islands, would flee the country.\n\n\"The thing that is troubling me is I don't know if I can trust Mr. Rubin,\" Kuo said in denying bail. She said she has no way of knowing for certain if Rubin is mulling, \"What does my life look like if I flee, and what does it look like if I stay?\"\n\nRubin's 10-count indictment alleges a series of attacks against 10 Jane Does between 2009 and 2019 in luxury hotels and a soundproofed bedroom \"sex dungeon\" at his Manhattan penthouse apartment.\n\nRubin, 70, of Fairfield, Connecticut, pleaded not guilty and has been held without bail since his arrest in September. Rubin was once considered one of Wall Street's most skilled and aggressive traders of complex mortgage securities, earning him roles at influential firms like Merrill Lynch and Soros Fund Management.\n\nIn his latest bid for freedom, his lawyers had offered a $70 million bond, co-signed by family members. They include his wife, who has been divorcing him since 2021, and who wrote a letter to the judge extolling his devotion to three young grandchildren, who call him \"Pops.\"\n\n\"There is no allegation that Mr. Rubin engaged in any BDSM activity since 2019,\" his lawyers wrote in bail arguments filed Tuesday. \"He has been living in Connecticut for years, devoted to the care of his grandchildren,\" they wrote.\n\nFederal prosecutors countered that no amount of bail or electronic monitoring could guarantee Rubin's return to court; they also say that he has used threats and coercion to silence his accusers, allegations Rubin denies.\n\nRubin's former personal assistant, Jennifer Powers, has been charged with pocketing millions of dollars to arrange the encounters; she has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking charges and is free on $850,000 bail.\n\nHer husband, Stephen Powers, is free on $250,000, according to court records. Both Powers have pleaded not guilty to bank and tax fraud in connection with the encounters.\n\nThree attorneys for Rubin did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. A Department of Justice spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nRubin is due back in court on January 15. If convicted of the top sex trafficking charge, he faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years and as much as life in prison.",

    "description": "JPMorgan's mid-cap chief explains how investment banking works beyond Wall Street, and why the middle market has become a billion-dollar opportunity.",
    "fullText": "JPMorgan took a bet to build an investment banking machine outside Wall Street, and it tapped John Richert to do it.\n\nUnder Richert's watch, the business that serves founder-run companies with deep ties to their local economies has grown from four people to nearly 300 bankers, collectively generating more than $1 billion annually. After completing their junior analyst years — most often in New York — bankers on his team can relocate to any of the 13 offices the group operates across the country.\n\nIt's a model that challenges the traditional idea of investment banking as a strictly New York endeavor. What's far less visible is what it looks like to build and run a franchise in places like Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago, or across the Southeast.\n\nMid-cap investment banking deals generally fall within the range of roughly $2 billion and below, with the group's sweet spot for deal transaction value of about $500 million to $1.5 billion. Under Richert, who serves as the team's head, coverage sectors have expanded to encompass industrials, consumer retail, healthcare, media and communications, and more.\n\nWall Street rivals have taken note. Goldman Sachs launched its Cross Markets Group in 2019 to target founder-led and mid-sized companies, and UBS stood up a middle-market effort during the pandemic, dispatching bankers to the same cities where its wealth managers operate. What's more, the pipeline between capital markets teams and wealth advisers is become more intertwined, creating lucrative referral opportunities as founders seek to invest the wealth created from major IB transactions.\n\nRichert spoke to Business Insider from his office in Atlanta about what it's like to build a national investment-banking operation far from New York — and why he's optimistic about where the middle market is headed in the coming year. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nHow are you feeling about the mid-cap M&A environment heading into next year?\n\nI think we're pretty optimistic on 2026. We have our highest backlog sell-sides that we've ever had.\n\nWe have a lot of private equity funds that need to return capital to their LPs. They need to sell assets. You have a lot of funds that aren't going to be able to raise another fund but have a bunch of portfolio companies that they're going to need to sell. You've got aging baby boomers and founder-owned businesses that children are not wanting to take over the business.\n\nWhy does being local matter so much in your business, and how does that shape the way your team is built across the country?\n\nA dinner, bumping into a CEO on a Saturday on the soccer field or at kids' events. Like being in the communities, commercial banking is a local business. You've got to be in front of your clients. I once had a CEO tell me, \"The reason we like having you local is we like bumping into you and seeing you in the community. When you come and visit us, you're just paying a visit. You're not flying in from New York.\"\n\nWe don't chase fees or transactions, we chase relationships. Over time, if you do that, when that client decides that he has a transaction he needs you to work on, you've built that relationship over months and years. Local matters in our opinion.\n\nWhat's the allure of working outside of New York, and how can bankers who do stay plugged in with clients?\n\nI do think that analysts and associates should start out in New York to be in the center and the nexus of where it's happening. But then when you're tired of Manhattan or tired of commuting in from the tri-state area, there's a lot of great places you can work.\n\nCome to New York or LA, the two big concentrations for us. Do your two years there, and then once you get promoted to associate, if you're from the Southeast or the Midwest or Texas or the West Coast, we have these offices you can go work in.\n\nTake us back to the beginning. How did JPMorgan's mid-cap banking group start, and why was it created?\n\nI was at Barclays when I got a call from Doug Petno, now our CEO of JPMorgan's corporate investment bank. The firm asked me to move to Atlanta when we started this business about 12 years ago. Doug's first question was: What's our investment banking market share? And it was a low single digits compared to high single digits for the overall investment bank at JPMorgan. His first question was, 'Why is that?'\n\nI'm originally from Tennessee, so they said, \"You're the southerner. Would you like to go to Atlanta?\" We started in New York, Dallas, Chicago, and Atlanta.\n\nWhat challenges did you face as you built the business from the ground up?\n\nWe needed to find the right mix of talent who were both highly skilled and, critically, excited to help build something new and enduring in the industry — and that isn't easy. Hiring is a full time job.\n\nWe looked for individuals who saw the opportunity to innovate and grow, and who were willing to take a leap of faith with us. This endeavor was and continues to be very entrepreneurial. We are here building something brand new within JPMorgan, which is incredibly exciting but also incredibly hard work.\n\nHow is AI changing the work your bankers do today and do you think it will change who gets into banking or affect the number of jobs?\n\nWe have an internal LLM that summarizes information and makes us smarter when we talk to clients. Tasks that used to take a day to do, you can now do in an hour using AI.\n\nBut we are not doing anywhere near as much as we should be. Drafting S-1s, drafting confidential information memoranda, drafting communications — all of that we should be using AI to create efficiencies for the analysts' and associates' work.\n\nAI will allow us to cover more clients, which requires more people. Nobody likes staying up all night writing an S1. But if you can do an S1 in six or seven hours by using AI and leave the office at 8, that's not eliminating people. It's just making it a better lifestyle business.\n\nWhat part of running this business keeps you up at night?\n\nMy focus is always on ensuring our team is set up for success and that we maintain our drive for excellence.\n\nThere are myriad macro factors causing uncertainty across the market, and we are of course monitoring them all closely. Our priority is to stay agile and proactive so we can continue delivering outstanding results for our clients, no matter the environment.\n\nHow would you describe your leadership style and the culture you've built?\n\nLead by example. There's nothing I would ask anybody on my team to do that I have not done or would not do myself.\n\nI tell everyone, 'This is just a job. Family comes first. Treat everyone you meet with respect.'\n\nI'm trying to make this team the best it can be. Everyone from the top to the bottom matters. The MDs can't be successful without the analyst, and the analyst can't be successful without the MDs. Culture is not transferred over Zoom.\n\nIt's pretty easy. Just go give good advice to your clients. The rest of it will work out.",

    "title": "Wall Street eyes AI bubble as skepticism grows over trillion-dollar bets",
    "description": "Wall Street sees AI bubble coming and is betting on what pops it.",
    "fullText": "It’s been three years since OpenAI set off euphoria over artificial intelligence with the release of ChatGPT. And while the money is still pouring in, so are the doubts about whether the good times can last.\n\nA recent sell-off in the shares of Nvidia Corp., Oracle Corp.’s plunge after reporting mounting spending on AI, souring sentiment around a network of companies exposed to OpenAI — signs of skepticism are increasing. Looking to 2026, the debate among investors is whether to rein in AI exposure ahead of a potential bubble popping or double down to capitalize on the game-changing technology.\n\n“We’re in the phase of the cycle where the rubber meets the road,” said Jim Morrow, chief executive of Callodine Capital Management. “It’s been a good story, but we’re sort of anteing up at this point to see whether the returns on investment are going to be good.”\n\nThe queasiness about the AI trade involves its uses, the enormous cost of developing it, and whether consumers ultimately will pay for the services. Those answers will have major implications for the stock market’s future.\n\nThe Standard & Poor’s 500 index’s three-year, $30-trillion bull run has largely been driven by the world’s biggest tech companies such as Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp., as well as firms benefiting from spending on AI infrastructure such as chipmakers Nvidia and Broadcom Inc. and electricity providers such as Constellation Energy Corp. If they stop rising, the equities indexes will follow.\n\n“These stocks don’t correct because the growth rate goes down,” said Sameer Bhasin, principal at Value Point Capital. “These stocks correct when the growth rate doesn’t accelerate any further.”\n\nOf course, there are still plenty of reasons for optimism. The tech giants that account for much of the AI spending have vast resources and have pledged to keep pumping in cash in the years ahead. Plus, developers of AI services, such as Alphabet’s Google, continue to make strides with new models. Hence the debate.\n\nHere’s a look at the key trends to watch while navigating through these choppy waters.\n\nOpenAI alone plans to spend $1.4 trillion in the coming years. But the Sam Altman-led company, which became the world’s most valuable startup in October, is generating far less revenue than its operating costs. It expects to burn $115 billion through 2029 before generating cash in 2030, the Information reported in September.\n\nThe company has had no problem with fundraising, collecting $40 billion from Softbank Group Corp. and other investors earlier this year. Nvidia pledged to invest as much as $100 billion in September, one of a series of deals the chipmaker has made that funnel cash to its customers, which is causing fears of circular financing in the AI industry.\n\nOpenAI could run into trouble if investors start to balk at committing more capital. And the consequences would spiral to the companies in its orbit, such as computing services provider CoreWeave Inc.\n\n“If you think about how much money — it’s in the trillions now — is crowded into a small group of themes and names, when there’s the first hint of that theme even having short-term issues or just valuations get so stretched they can’t possibly continue to grow like that, they’re all leaving at once,” said Eric Clark, portfolio manager at the Rational Dynamic Brands Fund.\n\nPlenty of other companies are reliant on external funding to pursue AI ambitions. Oracle shares soared as it racked up bookings for cloud computing services, but building those data centers will require massive amounts of cash, which the company has secured by selling tens of billions of dollars in bonds. Using debt puts pressure on a company because bondholders need to be paid in cash on a schedule, unlike equity investors, who mostly profit as share prices rise.\n\nOracle’s stock got pounded on Thursday after the company reported significantly higher capital expenditures than expected in its fiscal second quarter and cloud sales growth missed the average analyst estimate. On Friday, a report that some data center projects it’s developing for OpenAI have been delayed sent Oracle’s shares down further and weighed on other stocks exposed to AI infrastructure. Meanwhile, a gauge of Oracle’s credit risk hit the highest level since 2009.\n\nAn Oracle spokesperson said in a statement that the company remained confident in its ability to meet its obligations and future expansion plans.\n\n“The credit people are smarter than the equity people, or at least they’re worried about the right thing — getting their money back,” said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.\n\nAlphabet, Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are projected to spend more than $400 billion on capital expenditures in the next 12 months, most of it for data centers. Although those companies are seeing AI-related revenue growth from cloud-computing and advertising businesses, it’s nowhere near the costs they’re incurring.\n\n“Any plateauing of growth projections or decelerations, we’re going to wind up in a situation where the market says, ‘OK, there’s an issue here,’” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading.\n\nEarnings growth for the Magnificent Seven tech giants, which also includes Apple Inc., Nvidia and Tesla Inc., is projected to be 18% in 2026, the slowest in four years and slightly better than the S&P 500, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nRising depreciation expenses from the data center binge is a major worry. Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta combined for about $10 billion in depreciation costs in the final quarter of 2023. The figure rose to nearly $22 billion in the quarter that just ended in September. And it’s expected to be about $30 billion by this time next year.\n\nAll of this could put pressure on buybacks and dividends, which return cash to stockholders. In 2026, Meta and Microsoft are expected to have negative free cash flow after accounting for shareholder returns, while Alphabet is seen roughly breaking even, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nPerhaps the biggest concern about all the spending is the strategy shift it represents. Big Tech’s value has long been premised on the companies’ ability to generate rapid revenue growth at low costs, which resulted in immense free cash flows. But their plans for AI have turned that upside down.\n\n“If we continue down the track of lever up our company to build out for the hopes that we can monetize this, multiples are going to contract,” O’Rourke said. “If things don’t come together for you, this whole pivot would have been a drastic mistake.”\n\nWhile Big Tech’s valuations are high, they’re nowhere near excessive compared with past periods of market euphoria. Comparisons with the dot-com bust are common, but the magnitude of the gains from AI are nothing like what happened during the development of the internet. For example, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index is priced at 26 times projected profits, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That figure exceeded 80 times at the height of the dot-com bubble.\n\nValuations during the dot-com era were far in excess of where they are now partly because of how far the stocks had run, but also because the companies were younger and less profitable — if they had profits at all.\n\n“These aren’t dot-com multiples,” said Tony DeSpirito, global chief investment officer and portfolio manager of fundamental equities at BlackRock. “This isn’t to say there aren’t pockets of speculation or irrational exuberance, because there are, but I don’t think that exuberance is in the AI-related names of the Mag 7.”\n\nPalantir Technologies Inc., which trades at a multiple of more than 180 times estimated profits, is among the AI stocks with nosebleed valuations. Snowflake Inc. is another, with a multiple of almost 140 times projected earnings. But Nvidia, Alphabet and Microsoft are all below 30 times, which is relatively tame considering all the euphoria surrounding them.\n\nAll of which leaves investors in a quandary. Yes, the risks are right on the surface even as investors keep pouring into AI stocks. But for now, most companies aren’t priced at panic-inducing levels. The question is which direction the AI trade goes from here.\n\n“This kind of group thinking is going to crack,” Value Point’s Bhasin said. “It probably won’t crash like it did in 2000. But we’ll see a rotation.”\n\nWittenstein writes for Bloomberg.",

    "description": "The Jeffrey Epstein victims'  lawsuits resembled two others, against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, which settled for hundreds of millions.",
    "fullText": "A federal judge expressed skepticism about a pair of lawsuits that victims of Jeffrey Epstein had filed against two banks, suggesting he may dismiss them before they have a chance to go to trial.\n\nAt the outset of a Monday afternoon hearing in Manhattan federal court, US District Judge Jed Rakoff unfavorably compared the lawsuits against Bank of America and BNY Mellon to two similar lawsuits he had previously overseen, against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank. JPMorgan agreed to settle the case for $290 million. Deutsche Bank agreed to settle for $75 million.\n\nRakoff said the language in the lawsuits against Bank of America and BNY Mellon — which were brought by the same attorneys and filed in October — was \"frequently conclusory\" and appeared to lack sufficient detail to demonstrate what the banks did wrong. He called the lawsuits \"a model of high-pitched rhetoric.\"\n\n\"'Knows' without saying by whom is vague. 'Affiliated' without saying what that means is vague,\" Rakoff told David Boies, an attorney who brought the case. \"A lot of that language is in the complaint.\"\n\nAt the end of the hearing, Rakoff gave the lawyers who brought the lawsuits on behalf of Epstein victims — David Boies, Sigrid McCawley, Brad Edwards, and Brittany Henderson — two weeks to revise their cases with more specific details about their allegations.\n\nThe judge said they would be permitted to use material they had already gathered as part of the discovery process in the case, but should put a hold on additional depositions and subpoenas until he issued a ruling, which he said could come at the end of January.\n\nThe lawsuits allege that Bank of America and BNY Mellon aided in Epstein's sex-trafficking operation by providing him with banking services and then ignoring red flags tied to his transactions.\n\nEpstein, a well-connected financier, killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on criminal sex-trafficking charges. One of his associates, Ghislaine Maxwell, is serving a 20-year prison sentence for trafficking girls to him.\n\nMonday's hearing was scheduled for the judge to weigh motions to dismiss the two lawsuits outright.\n\nCharlotte Taylor, an attorney at the law firm Jones Day representing Bank of America, argued the lawsuits consisted of \"recycled boilerplate allegations\" and that they could not prove the bank provided anything other than \"routine banking services\" to Epstein and his associates. Felicia Ellsworth, an attorney at WilmerHale, said the plaintiffs couldn't prove anyone at BNY Mellon had the \"state of mind\" to be found liable.\n\nBoies told Rakoff that the banks should have noticed enough smoke around the transactions from bank accounts belonging to Epstein and his associates to know there was a fire. Aside from Epstein's 2008 criminal conviction in Florida, he had been dogged by civil litigation for years, Boies said.\n\nRakoff expressed skepticism that the pattern of facts alleged in the lawsuit would be enough.\n\n\"Last I checked, that's not enough to survive a motion to dismiss,\" Rakoff said. \"You need to have enough allegations as to specific facts.\"\n\nFollowing the hearing, lawyers for the Epstein victims appeared eager to revise their lawsuits and include the information they obtained through the discovery process. Rakoff said that material may be redacted on the public docket.\n\n\"I think he's giving us a chance,\" Sigrid McCawley, an attorney at Boies Schiller Flexner, told Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Canada is coming up with ways to put its stockpiled American liquor to good use.\n\nSeveral provinces in the country halted imports of US booze and removed it from store shelves in March in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nNow, at least four provinces are planning to sell the remaining inventory and donate proceeds to food banks.\n\nCanada's far eastern province, Prince Edward Island, told Business Insider that its government will put its stock of American booze, which it had pulled off the shelves, back in stores starting on December 11.\n\nA representative for the province's finance department said the government anticipates profits of $600,000 Canadian dollars, or about $434,000, from the sale. The proceeds will be distributed to food banks across the island. The province says it does not intend to place any further orders for American alcohol.\n\nThe finance office of Newfoundland and Labrador told Business Insider it had made an upfront payment of $500,000 on Tuesday to 60 provincial food banks before the sales of any liquors, a move that will help more than 15,400 people. After the liquor is sold, more donations will go to the food banks for a total sum of up to $1 million.\n\nManitoba and Nova Scotia have similar plans.\n\nManitoba said it will sell its inventory through private retailers and restaurants, with the estimated $500,000 in net revenue going to food banks, holiday charities, children's organizations, and an advocacy group for First Nations.\n\nAs for Nova Scotia, the province is making a $4 million upfront payment to groups that provide food access, and the money will be recouped when the $14 million worth of liquor is eventually sold.\n\n\"We will not be ordering any more from the United States once this inventory is gone,\" the province's premier, Tim Houston, said in a statement. \"But Nova Scotians have already paid for this product.\"\n\nHe added, \"We don't want it to go to waste. That's why we're selling it and using the proceeds to help those in need.\"\n\nIn Canada, the sale of alcohol is mainly controlled by provincial governments, each of which establishes a board to oversee the matter. Only Alberta has a completely privatized alcohol retail system, while Saskatchewan has a partially privatized system.\n\nCanada mainly imports whiskey and bourbon, alongside beer and other spirits, from the US.\n\nA spokesperson for Ontario's finance ministry told Business Insider that the province had no plans to put the booze on store shelves soon.\n\n\"US alcohol will remain off shelves and is being held in storage until further notice,\" said the spokesperson. \"We are currently exploring options for the products.\"\n\nOntario did not disclose how much inventory it still has, but the province said the inventory it had pulled off the shelves in March was worth around C$80 million.\n\nA government representative from the Northwest Territories and a spokesperson of the British Columbia Liquor Distribution Branch both told Business Insider that they ceased US liquor imports in March, but will continue selling the stockpiled products until they are depleted.\n\nA Yukon government cabinet representative said Yukon has the same plan.\n\nHowever, the mountainous province of Alberta continues to import and sell American booze.\n\n\"In June this year, Alberta lifted restrictions on the purchase of US alcohol from American companies, signalling a renewed commitment to open and fair trade with our largest partner,\" a spokesperson of Service Alberta and Red Tape Reduction told Business Insider.\n\nThe matter of US booze has been fueling the trade tension between the two neighbors.\n\nThe animosity started when Trump imposed a 25% tariff on Canada in March and commented that Canada should become a state of the US.\n\nDespite later walking back some of his broader tariffs and upholding a previous agreement that ensured most goods remain tariff-free, Trump's moves have drawn the ire of Canadians, who have canceled travel plans and boycotted American goods in stores.\n\nAccording to the Distilled Spirits Council, US spirits exports to Canada plummeted 85% in the second quarter of 2025, falling below $10 million in export value.\n\n\"We hope both the US and Canada can address their respective concerns,\" said Chris Swonger, the CEO of the council. \"And that our products can return to Canadian retail shelves as soon as possible.\"\n\nIn March, Kentucky's bourbon makers said Canada's ban on American alcohol would hurt them.\n\nEric Gregory, the president of the Kentucky Distillers' Association, said in March that retaliatory tariffs would have \"far-reaching consequences across Kentucky, home to 95% of the world's bourbon.\"",

    "description": "Bloated valuations and an aging bull market are two things that could hold back the S&P 500 for the next decade, forecasters say.",
    "fullText": "A dark thought is starting to circulate around Wall Street. What if, after years of stellar gains, the US stock market is basically flat for the next decade?\n\nThat feels like an unbelievable idea given the current bull run for the stock market, which is just the latest in a larger secular rally that's been going on for almost 15 years.\n\nThe gains continued to pile up on Thursday. As investors fled tech amid worries about Oracle's earnings, they pumped the benchmark S&P 500 and the Dow to fresh record highs.\n\nBut the possibility of the party soon coming to an end is being floated by a growing number of forecasters, who see two main reasons the market could be held back:\n\nNow, more analysts see what could be a lost decade coming for stocks — a 10-year period where the US market sees near-zero returns or severely lags other markets around the world.\n\nIn a note this week, Bank of America said its team of equity strategists saw the S&P 500 shedding 0.1% over the next decade. Historically, that's a terrible performance, given that the S&P 500 has gained an average 10.5% a year since the 1950s.\n\nStrategists pointed to high valuations and back-to-back years of double-digit growth in the benchmark index.\n\n\"Even for next year, the math of history is tough: average returns for the S&P 500 after 3 years of >15% growth are 2.3ppt lower than the average annual return. Investors may need GDP & EPS surprises to avoid a seventh 'lost decade,'\" BofA wrote in a client note.\n\nTorsten Sløk, the chief economist at Apollo, also said he expects the S&P 500 to remain relatively flat for the next 10 years. That projection is based on where the forward price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 currently resides, he said on Thursday.\n\n\"The historical relationship between the S&P 500 forward P/E ratio and subsequent 10-year annualized returns shows that investors should expect to get zero in return in the S&P 500 over the coming decade,\" Sløk said.\n\nIn November, Goldman Sachs analysts said they saw the US market coming in last place for returns in the coming 10-year stretch. The S&P 500 is on track to gain around 6.5% a year for the next 10 years, the bank estimated, falling short of estimated returns in Europe, Japan, Asia, and emerging markets.\n\nThe bank said it expected earnings growth to be stronger in other markets. Valuations in the US are also high and on track to decline around 1% annually over the next decade, per Goldman's analysis.\n\n\"If the profitability and/or valuations of the largest companies falter, unless another cohort of 'superstars' emerges, returns for the broad market will likely be hampered as today's largest stocks fall back to earth,\" analysts wrote of their bearish scenario for the US market.",

    "description": "Michael Burry pointed to the Fed's plan to start purchasing short-term Treasurys as a sign of weakness in the banking system.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry thinks he's spotted another sign of trouble in the US financial system.\n\nThe famed investor of \"The Big Short\" said he was eyeing one comment in particular that came out the Fed's meeting on Wednesday. That's the mention that the FOMC believes the Fed's reserve balances had declined to \"ample levels\" — and that the central bank would start making \"reserve management purchases.\"\n\nIt's a jargony way of saying the Fed will start purchasing short-term US Treasurys \"on an ongoing basis,\" per the committee's statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\nPurchasing short-term T-bills — which the Fed will start doing on December 12 and total around $40 billion a month — is one way the central bank can boost liquidity in markets and the banking sector. It's slightly different from quantitative easing, which is when the Fed purchases long-term Treasurys to stimulate the economy by keeping a lid on borrowing costs. However, in the short term, it has a similar effect of boosting the amount of money circulating through the financial system, making it easier for banks to meet their reserve requirements.\n\nBut the fact that the Fed has to provide that support at all is a worrying sign, in Burry's view. The Fed's reserve balances currently hover around $2.8 trillion, according to the latest weekly data from the central bank.\n\n\"I would add if the US banking system can't function without $3+ trillion in reserves/life support from the Fed, that is not a sign of strength but a sign of fragility,\" Burry wrote in a post on X Wednesday evening. \"So I'd say US Banks are getting weaker way too fast.\"\n\nStocks surged after the Fed's policy meeting, largely fueled by optimism about the central bank's plan to purchase short-term Treasury bills, JPMorgan's market intelligence team wrote in a note.\n\nThe purchase of short-term Treasurys marks the first time the Fed has meaningfully expanded its balance sheet since it ended its quantitative easing prgram in 2022, analysts at Deutsche Bank said.\n\n\"Seems that after every crisis now the Fed needs to expand its balance sheet permanently or guarantee a bank funding crisis. No wonder stocks are doing well,\" Burry said, adding that he was avoiding bank stocks and choosings to keep his money in cash accounts or Treasury money market funds.\n\n\"Rip QT; long live 'reserve management purchases,'\" he added.\n\nBurry, who correctly called the subprime mortgage crisis, has cemented his reputation as a permabear in recent years. Since returning to social media this year, he has repeatedly sounded the alarm on a stock market bubble, unveiled fresh bets against AI titans like Nvidia, and warned about the huge amounts of spending by the biggest tech companies.",
