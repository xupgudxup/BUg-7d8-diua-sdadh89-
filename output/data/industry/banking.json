    "fullText": "A dark thought is starting to circulate around Wall Street. What if, after years of stellar gains, the US stock market is basically flat for the next decade?\n\nThat feels like an unbelievable idea given the current bull run for the stock market, which is just the latest in a larger secular rally that's been going on for almost 15 years.\n\nThe gains continued to pile up on Thursday. As investors fled tech amid worries about Oracle's earnings, they pumped the benchmark S&P 500 and the Dow to fresh record highs.\n\nBut the possibility of the party soon coming to an end is being floated by a growing number of forecasters, who see two main reasons the market could be held back:\n\nNow, more analysts see what could be a lost decade coming for stocks — a 10-year period where the US market sees near-zero returns or severely lags other markets around the world.\n\nIn a note this week, Bank of America said its team of equity strategists saw the S&P 500 shedding 0.1% over the next decade. Historically, that's a terrible performance, given that the S&P 500 has gained an average 10.5% a year since the 1950s.\n\nStrategists pointed to high valuations and back-to-back years of double-digit growth in the benchmark index.\n\n\"Even for next year, the math of history is tough: average returns for the S&P 500 after 3 years of >15% growth are 2.3ppt lower than the average annual return. Investors may need GDP & EPS surprises to avoid a seventh 'lost decade,'\" BofA wrote in a client note.\n\nTorsten Sløk, the chief economist at Apollo, also said he expects the S&P 500 to remain relatively flat for the next 10 years. That projection is based on where the forward price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 currently resides, he said on Thursday.\n\n\"The historical relationship between the S&P 500 forward P/E ratio and subsequent 10-year annualized returns shows that investors should expect to get zero in return in the S&P 500 over the coming decade,\" Sløk said.\n\nIn November, Goldman Sachs analysts said they saw the US market coming in last place for returns in the coming 10-year stretch. The S&P 500 is on track to gain around 6.5% a year for the next 10 years, the bank estimated, falling short of estimated returns in Europe, Japan, Asia, and emerging markets.\n\nThe bank said it expected earnings growth to be stronger in other markets. Valuations in the US are also high and on track to decline around 1% annually over the next decade, per Goldman's analysis.\n\n\"If the profitability and/or valuations of the largest companies falter, unless another cohort of 'superstars' emerges, returns for the broad market will likely be hampered as today's largest stocks fall back to earth,\" analysts wrote of their bearish scenario for the US market.",

    "title": "'Big Short' investor Michael Burry says the latest Fed meeting points to trouble in the banking system",
    "description": "Michael Burry pointed to the Fed's plan to start purchasing short-term Treasurys as a sign of weakness in the banking system.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry thinks he's spotted another sign of trouble in the US financial system.\n\nThe famed investor of \"The Big Short\" said he was eyeing one comment in particular that came out the Fed's meeting on Wednesday. That's the mention that the FOMC believes the Fed's reserve balances had declined to \"ample levels\" — and that the central bank would start making \"reserve management purchases.\"\n\nIt's a jargony way of saying the Fed will start purchasing short-term US Treasurys \"on an ongoing basis,\" per the committee's statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\nPurchasing short-term T-bills — which the Fed will start doing on December 12 and total around $40 billion a month — is one way the central bank can boost liquidity in markets and the banking sector. It's slightly different from quantitative easing, which is when the Fed purchases long-term Treasurys to stimulate the economy by keeping a lid on borrowing costs. However, in the short term, it has a similar effect of boosting the amount of money circulating through the financial system, making it easier for banks to meet their reserve requirements.\n\nBut the fact that the Fed has to provide that support at all is a worrying sign, in Burry's view. The Fed's reserve balances currently hover around $2.8 trillion, according to the latest weekly data from the central bank.\n\n\"I would add if the US banking system can't function without $3+ trillion in reserves/life support from the Fed, that is not a sign of strength but a sign of fragility,\" Burry wrote in a post on X Wednesday evening. \"So I'd say US Banks are getting weaker way too fast.\"\n\nStocks surged after the Fed's policy meeting, largely fueled by optimism about the central bank's plan to purchase short-term Treasury bills, JPMorgan's market intelligence team wrote in a note.\n\nThe purchase of short-term Treasurys marks the first time the Fed has meaningfully expanded its balance sheet since it ended its quantitative easing prgram in 2022, analysts at Deutsche Bank said.\n\n\"Seems that after every crisis now the Fed needs to expand its balance sheet permanently or guarantee a bank funding crisis. No wonder stocks are doing well,\" Burry said, adding that he was avoiding bank stocks and choosings to keep his money in cash accounts or Treasury money market funds.\n\n\"Rip QT; long live 'reserve management purchases,'\" he added.\n\nBurry, who correctly called the subprime mortgage crisis, has cemented his reputation as a permabear in recent years. Since returning to social media this year, he has repeatedly sounded the alarm on a stock market bubble, unveiled fresh bets against AI titans like Nvidia, and warned about the huge amounts of spending by the biggest tech companies.",
