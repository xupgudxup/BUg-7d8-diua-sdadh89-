    "title": "Trump calls to ban Wall Street from buying homes, but industry insiders say the business model has already moved on",
    "description": "Industry insiders say Trump's call to ban big investors is out of sync with how those players actually buy homes.",
    "fullText": "Trump's pledge to upend Wall Street's 15-year push into the market for single-family American homes raised alarms across the real estate investment industry — and skepticism.\n\n\"I'm not concerned about it,\" said Todd Henderson, the head of real estate for the Americas at DWS, an investment firm that has purchased single-family rental homes.\n\nWhile details of Trump's proposal are unknown, Henderson expects that it will eventually exclude institutional buyers who have purchased newly built homes, which have become the focus of much of the single-family rental (SFR) industry.\n\n\"The fear is that large investors are buying single-family homes and that it's taking out of the sales pool and driving up the cost of housing — that's what is driving this discussion,\" Henderson said. \"We're building this stuff and adding it to supply.\"\n\nIn a message on his social media platform Truth Social on Wednesday, Trump said that he was \"immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes.\"\n\n\"People live in homes, not corporations,\" Trump wrote.\n\nSome analysts, however, suggested that that view was out of step with the institutional SFR industry's contemporary business model, which has shifted away from the inefficient — and politically sensitive practice — of competing against everyday homebuyers to scoop up properties one by one.\n\nInvitation Homes, a public company that is one of the largest owners of SFR homes, \"has almost exclusively moved to acquiring homes from homebuilders rather than on the MLS,\" according to a research note from RBC.\n\n\"AMH's external growth comes from development rather than acquisitions,\" Barclays wrote in a report, referring to American Homes 4 Rent, another large SFR owner.\n\nTrump's announcement caused shares of Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent to fall by about 7% and 9% respectively, according to KBW.\n\nOther major investors, including Blackstone, also saw an impact on share prices. Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, a non-trade REIT managed by the firm, holds about $11 billion worth of SFR investments totaling about 9% of its portfolio.\n\nJade Rahmani, an analyst at KBW, wrote that the market reaction \"seems excessive and could present a buying opportunity\" in a Wednesday report on the potential ban.\n\nDetails were scant about how Trump's prohibition on Wall Street homebuying would work.\n\nTrump said that he would be \"calling on Congress to codify it\" and that he would \"discuss this topic\" during \"my speech in Davos in two weeks.\"\n\nTrump has walked back policies, such as his tariffs, due to disruptions to the economy and investor concerns.\n\nThe likely need for congressional approval could insert more complexity — and uncertainty — over the process of formalizing an SFR ban.\n\nA Mizuho report said that Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno had proposed a bill to codify Trump's SFR ban, but that it \"doesn't believe\" it will progress \"anytime soon.\"\n\nHenderson said he believes that any rules imposed on the SFR industry would exempt both builders and buyers of new SFR homes and would allow major investors to sell existing portfolios freely. Such caveats would leave the SFR industry basically unchanged.\n\n\"I think it will increase the value of the purpose-built SFR homes and make that strategy even more valuable,\" Henderson said.\n\nThe SFR industry has pointed out that its investors own a comparatively small share of the roughly 80 million single-family homes in the country.\n\nIn October 2023, Parcl Labs found that investors who own 10 residential units or more held about 3.4% of all single-family homes, and that larger investors with at least 1,000 units controlled just 0.73% of the inventory.\n\n\"Professional single-family housing providers represent a small segment of the overall housing market, and the single-family rental industry remains focused on supporting renters while also supporting pathways to homeownership,\" said a spokeswoman for National Rental Home Council, an industry group that represents SFR owners.",

    "description": "Recession fears have cooled, but a labor market chart flagged by one bearish strategist might give bullish investors pause.",
    "fullText": "Recession fears have cooled off in recent months as the US economy continues to prove resilient (did you see that GDP number?) and the Federal Reserve slashes interest rates.\n\nBut a labor market chart flagged by one bearish strategist on Tuesday might give investors pause.\n\nThe chart, shared in a client note from Société Générale's Albert Edwards, shows the US unemployment rate (in red) alongside its three-year moving average (dotted line). Since 1950, in eight instances where the unemployment rate has begun an uptrend and broken through its three-year moving average, a recession has followed.\n\n\"Recession is the biggest threat to equities, although in recent downturns financial problems have preceded (or caused) recessions,\" Edwards wrote in the note. \"I don't think any guru is forecasting a recession in 2026. Yet the simple correlation shown below has a 100% track record of success.\"\n\nThe chart mirrors the concept of the Sahm Rule Recession Indicator, which says that the US economy is in a recession when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate increases by more than 0.5% from its lows over the previous 12 months. In other words, if unemployment rises too quickly, it signals that things are about to get worse.\n\nAlthough it had been hailed for its back-tested accuracy since its release in 2019, the gauge produced its first false reading in August 2024.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the labor market weakens materially, as Edwards' chart suggests could happen. Hiring rates and job openings remain sluggish. But other important measures of the economy's health — like consumer spending and GDP growth — remain strong.\n\nAnother signal that a recession could be on the way, according to Edwards, is a steepening of the Treasury yield curve following its inversion. However, while falling short-term rates following an inversion are usually accompanied by a floundering job market and consumer, today's economy seems to be in a stronger starting place.",

    "description": "The new MDs hail from groups including investment banking and investing, as the bank rides renewed dealmaking momentum heading into the new year.",
    "fullText": "New Year's Eve is behind us, but if you hear the sound of bottles popping — it might be coming from the halls of Morgan Stanley's headquarters.\n\nThe Wall Street bank on Wednesday announced the appointment of 184 new managing directors — a roughly 6% increase from last year's class of 173 MDs.\n\nAt Morgan Stanley, managing director is the firm's highest designation. The announcement comes amid the annual promotion season on Wall Street and follows Goldman Sachs' November elevation of more than 600 managing directors, part of a biennial process at the rival firm.\n\nThe size of each of Morgan Stanley's annual MD classes has fluctuated. In 2024, the bank named 155 managing directors. In 2023, it also appointed 184; and in 2022, it elevated 199.\n\nSeventy percent of the newly appointed execs work in a revenue-generating capacity, interacting with clients and making the bank money, while 30% work in middle- and back-office or corporate functions.\n\nThe promotions come after a strong year for the firm's dealmaking business. Morgan Stanley finished third on the worldwide M&A financial advisory league tables, according to LSEG, trailing only Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan.\n\nIt ended the year advising on more than $1 trillion in deal value across more than 400 transactions, LSEG's December data show. That marked a significant jump from the prior year, when the bank advised on roughly $707 billion in deals across 368 mergers or acquisitions.\n\nAcross Wall Street, headhunters and investment bankers have told Business Insider in recent weeks that they expect 2026 to generate robust activity in mergers and the capital markets. That backdrop may help explain why 48% of Morgan Stanley's new managing directors came from its Institutional Securities Group, which advises corporate clients on IPOs, buyouts, and sales.\n\nThe bank informed the newly elevated executives on Wednesday and is expected to release the full list of names publicly in the coming days. The firm has also communicated bonuses to its employees, one of the first on Wall Street to inform workers how their contributions from last year resulted in their incentive compensation.\n\nBelow is a look at the statistics Morgan Stanley shared about the composition of its 2026 managing director class.\n\n70% in Revenue, 30% in Infrastructure, the firm's middle- and back-office or corporate functions.\n\nRegionally, Americas 67%, EMEA 18%, Asia 14%\n\nOf US-based MD promotes, 31% of the class are ethnically diverse and 69% are White.",

    "description": "We compiled a list of books that top Wall Streeters have recommended over the years that have helped them get ahead.",
    "fullText": "\"I recently read 'The Master, ' the biography of Roger Federer, who some would argue is one of the best (tennis) players, if not the best player, of all time. Every time I read one of the tennis biographies, you're reminded that it's a very all-consuming commitment to be one of the greatest. At least in the case of tennis, it's a very lonely existence. You're the only person out there. You in your mind battling it out. The key is making sure you surround yourself with the right team.\n\n\"Every player, at least in the major tournaments, has a player's box. You'll have the family, the coach, and some friends in the player's box.\n\n\"The lesson I think is who's in my player's box?  How do they help me keep going? And, similarly, at least in the investing world, am I in the player's box for others? How do I be the best person on the sidelines supporting?\"\n\n- Vinay Trivedi, General Atlantic\n\n\"This book explores sleep's impact on your body and mind.\"\n\n\"Before the coronavirus pandemic, I was a daily 4:30 A.M. workout warrior and advocate for holistic nutrition, but I certainly was not prioritizing sleep in my health equation. This was an eye-opening and convincing read that has helped me to get significantly more shut-eye.\"\n\n- Lacey Vigmostad Giliberto, JP Morgan\n\n\"I'm a bad sleeper. This book puts in layman's terms why you need to sleep and why it's important for so many reasons.\"\n\n\"It was a really interesting dichotomy. It's about a young African-American man who grew up in a rougher neighborhood in Newark but went to Yale and ended up being really successful in his academic work. But he struggled at times to mesh the two worlds together.\"\n\n\"It shows that the path to equality isn't always as easy and seamless. Going to Yale on a scholarship, it can still be really hard for people. People often don't get that.\"\n\n-Mir Subjally, Compass Rose Asset Management\n\n\"I am a little biased because I started my career at Citigroup, which is formerly Salomon Brothers. I also recommend 'Panic!' by Michael Lewis, and I generally like all the 'Market Wizards' series, which are helpful in knowing what fits your trading style and what doesn't.\"\n\n\"It shows that it's not just about you. In the grand scheme of things, it's how you help others along the way. How you can grow the pie for everyone.\"\n\n\"It's about striving to be somebody who gives to others and then expects nothing in return,\" she said, \"and how ironically fruitful that can be for your own life and career.\"\n\n- Lacey Vigmostad Giliberto, JP Morgan\n\nThe book holds insights into \"all the wrong reasons why you can go into finance.\"\n\n- Daniel Costanza, previously a head of data analytics at Yieldstreet\n\n\"It taught me that all decision-making should be driven by the gap between expected value and market price, and expected value is calculated by weighing each outcome by its probability of occurring.\n\n\"Second-level thinking is all about finding value that others don't appreciate yet. It's risk/reward times the coefficient of likelihood for being right.\"\n\n\"It's pretty technical, but a must-read for any quant.\"\n\n-Robert Lam, Man Group's Man Numeric\n\n\"I spend a lot of time with founder-led companies within the tech world. I like working with them because they're very focused on disrupting the status quo, not just in the businesses they're building but in anything they do, and that includes working with bankers and advisors writ large.\"\n\n\"They really force their advisors to think outside the box and challenge the traditional way of doing things. Part of Adam Grant's book is talking about what makes founders founders, and it's been incredible watching them ask a question that might be perceived as basic, but there's really sort of that double layer of, 'Why is it being done this way, and why can't we do it in a better, more efficient way?'\"\n\n\"He wrote this book that really shares some tips about how to have a happier life and ways that you can streamline things in your work; how to find a better work-life balance; and how to think about where you'd like to spend your time and how you're spending your time and the types of things you're investing in.\"\n\n\"I've picked up so many helpful tips and tricks from there. I feel like it's a must-read for people — financial-related or not, I think it applies to all different industries — on really how to take a step back and identify what is meaningful to you. And are you spending the right amount of time on things that you deeply care about versus things that are just, you know, background noise?\"\n\n\"I always thought a lot about what motivates people, how humans work, and what motivates them. I really appreciated his research and his take on that.\"\n\n\"It's one of the best management books. I think what's unique about the book is when I first looked at the title, I was a little bit intimidated by it — like, this is just for executive positions.\n\n\"But he looks at everyone being an executive in their role, and he provides some extremely practical advice on how to become more effective in anything we do in our everyday life. Some are well-known — such as time management, focusing on strengths.\n\n\"Even those obvious things that he brings up, he makes it so simple to apply in your everyday life. For example, on time management, there are just two questions you need to ask yourself on a regular basis: What would happen if I don't do certain things? And can these things be done by somebody else?\n\n\"That helps you to eliminate a lot of time-wasters and use time more wisely. Super simple, but at the same time, quite practical.\"\n\n- Mikhail Krayzler, Allianz Global Investors\n\n\"It's a book framed through the teaching of Marcus Aurelius, who was also a Roman emperor, and it covers how to optimize situations and make the best out of everything. The book does a great job of translating philosophy into modern context.\"\n\n\"As for how that translates to me: Clients expect a trusted advisor to maintain poise and equanimity in situations that are stressful to them. So this has been helpful in taking a teaching that is 2,000-plus years old and transferring it to the 21st century.\"\n\n- Christopher Oglesby, Bank of America\n\n\"Everything in the investing business is relationship-based, and Henry and George, the KKR founders, often talk about doing business with people you like and trust. This is a book I've read three or four times and is really a staple.\"\n\n\"What the author is trying to do is to help the reader look at the world and analyze global trends in a more objective way. In a very engaging and comical way, he shows you that human beings tend to think that the world is more dramatic than it really is. So people's brains are systematically misinterpreting the state of the world.\n\n\"Something that really hits on that point is the beginning of the book. He presents the reader with a set of 13 questions. Each question has three multiple-choice answers. The bottom line is that most people actually score lower than the theoretical chimpanzee would have on these questions.\n\n\"He tries to walk you through a formula to avoid looking at the world in this overly dramatized way. I think he's not talking specifically about the financial markets, but I think it's so relevant to investing because this is part of the way you can capitalize on opportunities.\"\n\n- Unoma Okolo,  Artisan Partners\n\n\"It's a great book about monetary policy in the Depression era that has major implications for how monetary policy and currencies have evolved.\"\n\n- Phil Salinger, former Bridgewater Associates\n\nThe book emphasizes \"how a growth mindset — or the belief that talents can be developed with hard work and good strategies and input from others — can enable much better outcomes than people with a fixed mindset, which is believing that talents are just innate gifts.\"\n\n\"The reason that a growth mindset matters so much is that it fosters an emphasis on learning and intellectual curiosity instead of trying to seem like the smartest person in the room, and that's something that I often reflect on for my own personal development as well, as a quality to look for as we bring on really amazing management teams.\"\n\n- Lexie Bartlett, General Atlantic\n\n\"For me, it's a game plan of how to actually seek solutions to the biggest existential threat that we actually face as a species and as a planet. Whenever I introduce people to the book, you see people get obsessed with the kinds of things that we can be doing, whether that's regenerative agriculture, renewable energy, or reducing food waste.\"\n\n\"Being a Fidelity person, I had to pick a Peter Lynch book. Beating the Street has been one of my favorites, such a classic. It's about how Peter ran Magellan day-to-day. And so I've just found it to be an excellent guide to investment processes for new fund managers.\"\n\n- Jennifer Fo Cardillo, Fidelity\n\n\"Much has been said about 'Margin of Safety' over the years, but in my opinion nothing quite compares to the original \"Security Analysis\" by Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd. They epitomized the concept through their careful approach, still relevant to this day.\"\n\n- Paul Kamenski, Man Group's Man Numeric\n\n\"I recently read 'Shoe Dog,' which is Phil Knight's autobiography and the story of how he founded Nike. I chose it because our firm is, in some respects, a startup, as we are launching new lines of business and building upon others, and I wanted to learn about an entrepreneur's success story.\n\nNike certainly had some difficult and existential issues in its early years, and the book was a good reminder about the importance of perseverance and believing in the value of one's work.\"\n\n- Jackie Klaber, Rockefeller Capital Management\n\n\"It is an interesting read, and I enjoy how David Einhorn seems so relentless when he believes in something.\"\n\n- Tanaka Maswoswe, Carlyle Group\n\nBob Iger, a former CEO at Disney, \"early on saw the need to create digital channels for his customers and understood the virtuous cycle he could create around the right types of content, which informed his M&A strategy. Some of the M&A moves that he did in the preceding 10 years were really prescient.\"\n\n\"Reading the stories of great investors is both fun and informative. What's most interesting is the commonalities you see between the two investors despite radically different approaches and asset classes.\"\n\n- Philip Dobrin, Bridgewater Associates\n\n\"There's a lot of game theory involved, analyzing big data to predict outcomes. The concepts in that book and trilogy are very relevant today.\"\n\n\"Looks at the benefits of late specialization and a diversity of experience, and how knowledge in a variety of arenas can pay off, especially when solving complex problems that require creative solutions.\"\n\nWe read it as part of an Asian-American affinity group at TPG. It's a very tactical book on how Asian Americans can advance in the workplace, and it's written in a style that gives stories of actual people but gives very tangible advice. I enjoyed it quite a bit.\n\n\"Compared with what has now often become fairly complex and evolved, his works as an early adopter of the approach were simple, intuitive, and persuasive, establishing clear roots for what it means to use a systematic approach.\"\n\n- Paul Kamenski, Man Group's Man Numeric\n\nA \"must-read\" for any aspiring tech investors.\n\n\"The book best represents how I think about investing and also articulates the success stories and habits of the best CEOs of the 20th century.\"\n\n- Sims Lansing, Lansing Management\n\n\"'Flash Boys' was a prime example of how technological innovation and forward-thinkers can reshape an entire industry. In 'Flash Boys,' novel computer algorithms and communications networks caused both market structure and behavioral changes to the trading industry.\n\n\"Similarly, today we're experiencing the confluence of cryptography, blockchain technology, and distributed systems, which are meaningfully challenging preconceived notions of not just the financial industry but what constitutes money.\"\n\n- Michael Sonnenshein, Securitize\n\n\"We have all this data and information on our laptops and on our phones, but it's not organized. So is it really serving us, is it really useful for us?\n\n\"The book talks about knowledge management systems and how to organize the data in such a way that works for the individual, and ultimately, getting to a point where we can share that with others.\"",

    "description": "Microsoft is leading Wedbush's AI stock list as its favorite large-cap tech company to own in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Wall Street's loudest tech bull has given his five top AI stock picks for next year, and Nvidia isn't one of them.\n\nThat's a bit of a surprise for Dan Ives, the Wedbush Securities analyst known for his vocal cheerleading for the stock as it climbed to records throughout the year.\n\nHe's instead focused on a handful of other mega-cap names heading into 2026, and sees AI approaching an \"inflection point\" next year, he write in a new note to clients.\n\n\"While Nvidia remains in our top tech names into 2026, there are 5 AI-focused names that we believe will be front and center heading into 2026,\" Ives said.\n\nWedbush's price target: $625 (+28% upside)\n\nRationale: Wall Street looks like it's underestimating the growth Microsoft could see with Azure. The company also looks poised to make an \"AI driven shift\" next year, Wedbush said, adding that Microsoft was its favorite large-cap tech stock to own in 2026.\n\n\"While AI use cases built markedly in FY25, its clear FY26 for Microsoft remains the true inflection year of AI growth as CIO lines build for deployments.\"\n\nWedbush's price target: $350 (+28% upside)\n\nRationale: Wedbush said it believed Apple would begin monetizing its AI products over the next few years. That could add $75 to $100 of value per share of company stock, Ives estimated.\n\n\"The elephant in the room remains the invisible AI strategy, with the biggest consumer installed base in the world of 2.4 billion iOS devices and 1.5 billion iPhones, the time is now for Apple to accelerate its AI efforts,\" he wrote.\n\nWedbush's price target: $600 (+32% upside)\n\nRationale: 2026 could be a \"monster year\" for Tesla as the EV company makes more ground on its AI and robotics initiatives, Ives suggested. He pointed to the company's ongoing development of its full self-driving technology and its Cybercab, which is expected to begin production in April next year.\n\n\"We believe Tesla could reach a $2 trillion market cap over the coming year and in a bull case scenario $3 trillion by the end of 2026,\" Wedbush said.\n\nWedbush's price target: $230 (+27% upside)\n\nRationale: Demand for Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform remains \"unprecedented,\" Ives said.\n\n\"With the company making strategic moves to remain at the forefront of AI, we believe that PLTR has a golden path to become a trillion-dollar market cap company and will grow into its valuation as Karp and Co. remain one of the largest players in the AI Revolution.\"\n\nWedbush's price target: $600 (+26% upside)\n\nRationale: CrowdStrike is gaining momentum in its AI deals. It also appears to be gaining market share as it expands its product suite.\n\n\"CrowdStrike remains one of our favorite tech names,\" Ives said. \"We believe the Street is underestimating the growth potential for CrowdStrike with cybersecurity remaining a second/third derivative beneficiary of the AI Revolution which speaks to our bullishness.\"",

    "fullText": "Tesla had a surprise Christmas present for investors this year: more bad news about its EV business.\n\nElon Musk's automaker published a press release on Monday with a consensus of analyst predictions for the company's latest quarterly sales, the first time it has publicly given Wall Street such a heads-up.\n\nThe delivery consensus, which is a compilation of predictions from analysts selected by Tesla, estimated that the EV giant sold 422,850 vehicles in the last three months of 2025, around 14.6% fewer than the same period last year.\n\nThat's lower than Wall Street's wider expectations. Analysts were expecting Tesla to sell 440,907 EVs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nIt's also a surprising move from Tesla, which typically does not issue public communications ahead of critical sales announcements.\n\nTesla, which is expected to report its latest quarterly sales as soon as Friday, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"This is highly unusual for Tesla to send out a press release with quarterly consensus delivery estimates,\" said Gary Black, managing partner at Future Fund, which sold its Tesla holdings in May.\n\nBlack wrote in the Tuesday post on X that the release suggested Tesla's Q4 sales were lower than the Bloomberg consensus and were, in his view, likely closer to 420,000.\n\nTesla's stock price hit a record high this month amid investor optimism over the company's robotaxi push, but the Cybertruck maker's core EV business has had a difficult year.\n\nTesla was hit hard by the collapse in electric car sales after the $7,500 federal tax credit expired in September.\n\nThe company's US sales reportedly fell to their lowest level since 2022 in November, despite the launch of cheaper versions of Tesla's bestselling Model 3 and Y EVs.\n\nThings haven't gone much better outside the US. Tesla has been buffeted by fierce competition from local rivals in China, where an army of EV startups has rolled out high-tech electric vehicles at rock-bottom prices.\n\nIn Europe, meanwhile, the US automaker's sales have collapsed nearly 30% so far this year amid backlash over Musk's political interventions.\n\nThe slump has left Tesla facing a race against time to avoid its second consecutive annual sales decline.\n\nTesla has rolled out a range of incentives in the US and is pushing to introduce its Full Self-Driving tech in China and Europe, but the surprise delivery consensus estimated that Tesla will end the year having sold over 100,000 fewer EVs than in 2024.",

    "description": "For Wall Streeters, finding the time to shop for presents can be tough.",
    "fullText": "Work schedules don't always have much sympathy for holiday plans — especially the notoriously grueling hours of the finance industry.\n\nWhen it comes to carving out time for gifting, some Wall Streeters opt to outsource the task, while others shop at convenient stores close to, or even within, their offices.\n\n\"This time of year, time seems to move a little bit faster,\" said Elisabeth Brown, the director of US membership at luxury travel and lifestyle concierge company Knightsbridge Circle.\n\nBrown said that gift help is a popular service among members, and that Knightsbridge Circle will suggest, buy, and even deliver items. Members devote time to talking about their preferences, and later to approving purchases, but otherwise pass off the responsibility.\n\nOther finance employees turn to personal shoppers for help. David Thielebuele, the fashion director of ready-to-wear at Bloomingdale's, said in an email that people turn to personal shoppers for a mix of \"convenience and expertise,\" especially during the end-of-year crunch. The personal shopping team can refine lists, buy items, and build event wardrobes.\n\n\"The real challenge is decision fatigue,\" Thielebuele said. Many clients can only devote fragmented chunks of time to gifting, he added, compounding the issue.\n\nFor those who do handle the shopping on their own, though, stores near the office can offer an easy solution. Jeremy Balrup, who covers sales and analytics for Bloomberg's enterprise data business and has worked in finance for around a decade, said he often stops by department stores near his office in Midtown Manhattan to buy gifts. If he's buying a sweater, he said he'll visit the J. Press store in Grand Central.\n\nThose who work at Goldman Sachs might not even have to leave the office to pick up gifts. The firm hosts a holiday market in New York, London, and Dallas offices, featuring graduates of its 10,000 Small Businesses program. Around 80 vendors sold their items between the fairs, and Goldman's global head of corporate engagement, Asahi Pompey, called it \"one of the most joyful days on our calendar.\"\n\nFor some, the holiday commitment goes beyond shopping alongside colleagues.\n\nIn a Business Insider survey about Wall Street gifting, about 40% of the respondents who said they work in finance said they were considering buying their colleagues presents. The most popular items to get them were wine or liquor, according to the unscientific survey, and Balrup said that a nice bottle is always a hit in his office's white elephant game.\n\nEileen Rizzo, the CEO of Zachys Wine and Liquor, said that her company's analytics show that people with interests in banking and investment are among the most active audience segments, and that New York is the most active market. Champagne is always hugely popular around the holidays, and Italian and Bordeaux wines are also highly requested, she said. Zachys' top customers tend to spend around $900 per order.\n\nAnd when it comes to what Wall Streeters want for themselves? Watches seem to be all the rage.",

    "description": "As the S&P 500 hovers near record highs, strategists shrug off concerns of an AI bubble, for now.",
    "fullText": "As stocks sit near all-time highs, strategists are brushing off concerns of an AI bubble.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) is on pace to close out the year with a gain of over 17%, powered by a 26% jump in technology stocks (XLK).\n\n“I don't see a bubble at all. However, I do believe we're going to be going into a bubble,” Sanctuary Wealth chief investment strategist Mary Ann Bartels told Yahoo Finance last week.\n\nBatels compared the current market to prior bubbles, including the late 1920s and the dot-com bubble.\n\n“We're tracking pretty similarly. In fact, it's kind of eerie how we're actually tracking that pattern,” she said. “I see a bubble occurring but not out until maybe ’29 into ’30.”\n\nBut for the time being, Sanctuary strategists forecast that tech will continue leading the market higher out into the end of the decade. They place the S&P 500 anywhere between 10,000 and 13,000 by 2030.\n\n“That's why we're calling 2026, you know, to be fearless, that there's still significant upside in this market, particularly for technology,” she said.\n\nPart of the upside comes from semiconductor stocks. Once treated as commodity plays, they become growth stocks, with Nvidia (NVDA) “basically rewriting the path for semiconductor chips.”\n\nThe AI chip powerhouse has surged over 40% so far this year, pushing its market cap to $4.6 trillion and making it the most valuable publicly traded company. On Friday, Nvidia shares rose after the company announced a $20 billion licensing deal with specialized chipmaker Groq (GROQ.PVT).\n\nThe deal was announced as the chip space has heated up, with Alphabet's Google (GOOG) making headlines with its specialized customer chips called TPUs.\n\nAlphabet stock has soared some 65% year to date.\n\nUBS strategists also expect the AI boom and robust profit growth to underpin market gains in 2026.\n\n“We note that forward price-to-earnings multiples are only marginally higher than at the start of the year, reinforcing the fact that earnings growth and not valuation bubbles have driven market gains,” wrote the strategists last week.\n\nUBS forecasts S&P 500 earnings per share to grow about 10% year over year, pushing the index to 7,700 by the end of next year.\n\nVeteran strategist Ed Yardeni also sees the index reaching 7,700 next year, with the probability of his \"Roaring 2020s\" scenario at 60%. He cited, among other reasons, tax benefits from the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" that passed this year and the AI boom.\n\nIn October, Goldman Sachs analysts argued the stock market isn’t in a bubble because tech stocks have risen mostly due to actual growth, not speculative bets. The firm noted that top-performing companies have strong balance sheets and the AI sector is still mostly led by a few big players, while most bubbles occur when many new entrants rush into a hot sector.",

    "fullText": "Russia’s financial system is reportedly coming under more strain as Moscow’s war on Ukraine nears the end of its fourth full year.\n\nThe White House is seeking to revive peace talks this weekend with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky due to meet President Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday. Russian forces stepped up their bombardment of Ukraine ahead of the meeting, but prolonged fighting presents risks for the economy.\n\n“A banking crisis is possible,” a Russian official told the Washington Post recently on condition of anonymity. “A nonpayments crisis is possible. I don’t want to think about a continuation of the war or an escalation.”\n\nRussia’s economy was surprisingly resilient in the face of severe Western sanctions after President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. That’s as China and India were eager to snap up cheap Russian oil, keeping the Kremlin’s coffers full and providing revenue for its military.\n\nBut more recently, energy prices have slumped while Europe and the U.S. have tightened sanctions. Oil and gas revenue has tumbled 22% in the first 11 months of the year, and Reuters estimated that December proceeds are on pace to sink nearly 50%.\n\nTo cover the shortfall in energy revenue, Moscow has tapped its sovereign wealth fund. But that is running out now too, so the government has resorted to raising more revenue via tax hikes.\n\nMeanwhile, a tight labor market and high inflation have forced the central bank to keep interest rates high, and recent easing has failed to prevent spending declines in several consumer categories.\n\nWith companies feeling the squeeze of high rates and weaker consumption, Russian data show unpaid wages nearly tripled in October from a year ago to more than $27 million, with the Post adding that furloughs and shorter workweeks are also becoming more common.\n\nAs a result, more consumers are having trouble servicing their loans. Given the headwinds, the Russian official warning of a banking or nonpayment crisis isn’t the first of its kind.\n\nIn June, Russian banks raised red flags on a potential debt crisis as high interest rates weigh on borrowers’ ability to service loans. Also that month, the head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs warned many companies were in “a pre-default situation.”\n\nAnd in September, Sberbank CEO German Gref, one of Russia’s top banking chiefs, said the economy was in “technical stagnation,” following his warnings in July and August that growth was close to zero.",

    "fullText": "In banking, telecom, and payments, reliability is not a nice to have. It is table stakes. The most reliable systems I have worked on reduce entire classes of bugs before the code even runs. Functional programming and Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) let you push correctness into the type system, so illegal states cannot be constructed in the first place.\n\nMost production incidents are not due to complex algorithms. They are due to the code entering a state that should never have been possible. If you have been on call, you have seen variants of these:\n\nFunctional programming helps by modeling the domain with types that make invalid states unrepresentable. Pure functions and immutability keep behavior predictable and testable.\n\nProduct types combine fields, think \"and\". Sum types choose one of several cases, think \"or\". Together they model your domain rules.\n\nWith this shape, \"paypal\" cannot exist as a Payment. The compiler refuses the value.\n\nWhen you pattern match on a sum type, the compiler can force you to handle every variant. If you later add a new case, every non exhaustive match becomes a compilation error or warning. This is how refactors become safe by default.\n\nAdd a new Crypto method and both code bases will point out every place you must update.\n\nIncident story\n\nA payout worker retries on network timeouts and calls settle() twice. The table allows pending = false and settled = true twice with the same ledger id. Reconciliation finds duplicates and accounting needs a manual fix.\n\nWhy it happened\n\nState is spread across booleans and strings. The database does not express the lifecycle. The application code does, but only by convention and tests.\n\nTransitions become total functions. You can return a Result when a transition is not allowed.\n\nNow the illegal transitions are blocked by construction. Test coverage still matters, but the shape of the model prevents a class of bugs.\n\nRefactor safety\n\nWhen product adds Chargeback, the compiler highlights every match that ignores it. You cannot ship with a half handled lifecycle.\n\nEvery switch on TxnState now requires a chargeback branch. This is free guidance from the compiler.\n\nIncident story\n\nThe call detail record pipeline generates billing events whenever it sees a Connected event. Under jitter and retries, some sessions never receive Completed. The billing system charges based on the wrong boundary and customers complain.\n\nWhy it happened\n\nThe call lifecycle is implicit across many services. A connected session with no end was still billable because there was no type that separated non billable states from billable ones.\n\nNow a connected but never completed call cannot produce a billable duration. The shape forbids the bug.\n\nIncident story\n\nA cache TTL is stored in an environment variable. Someone sets CACHE_TTL_SECS=30s. In JavaScript, Number(\"30s\") yields NaN and your code treats it as zero, disabling caching in production.\n\nThe ambiguity disappears. The code must handle absence and parse errors explicitly.\n\nDo not use null to mean \"maybe\". Do not throw exceptions for expected errors.\n\nThese types make the happy path and the error path equally explicit.\n\nMutable shared state is a common source of heisenbugs under concurrency. Prefer immutable data and pure functions. When you need to update, create a new value.\n\nYour tests become simple. Given the same inputs, the function returns the same output.\n\nNumbers are not self describing. Create types that carry meaning.\n\nYou stop mixing milliseconds with seconds or dollars with cents by accident.\n\nKeep the domain logic pure and push IO to the edges. This makes unit tests cheap and fast.\n\nStart small and make continuous progress. Here is a practical order for a team new to these ideas.\n\nReplace pairs of booleans with a sum type\n\nReplace string enums with discriminated unions\n\nReplace nullable fields with Option\n\nReplace thrown control flow with Result\n\nIntroduce newtypes or branded types for units and ids\n\nPattern matching compiles to simple branches. Discriminated unions in TypeScript are just plain objects. The main cost you will feel is validation at the boundaries in smart constructors. This is a trade worth making. The compiler then protects the interior of the system.\n\nReliability is designed. With Algebraic Data Types, pattern matching, Option and Result, immutability, and smart constructors, you encode domain rules directly in your types. Illegal states cannot compile. This is why industries that cannot afford failure, such as banking and telecom, gravitate to functional ideas.\n\nIf you work on code that touches money, minutes, or public availability, adopt these patterns now.\n\nYour on call shifts will be quieter, and your users will notice the difference.",

    "fullText": "Ripple Labs is doubling down on its presence in Japan, drawing on longstanding relationships with the country’s traditional financial institutions. The strategy is aimed at increasing adoption and interest in the XRP Ledger (XRPL).\n\nThis week, Asia Web3 Alliance Japan and Web3 Salon launched the Japan Financial Infrastructure Innovation Program. The initiative is designed to support Japanese startups developing next-generation, compliant digital financial solutions on the XRP Ledger.\n\nThe program opened applications on December 19 and is offering a $10,000 grant per startup. It is narrowly focused on three high-value verticals, including stablecoins, real-world asset tokenization, and credit infrastructure.\n\n\"Japan offers an overwhelming opportunity for blockchain innovation, supported by a forward-thinking regulatory framework and deep talent pool. This program represents Ripple's commitment to fostering a vibrant ecosystem where startups can leverage the speed, low cost, and reliability of the XRP Ledger to create real-world benefits and transform financial infrastructure,\" Christina Chan, Senior Director of Developer Growth at RippleX, said.\n\nAnalysts view it as a low-cost funnel for identifying candidates for Ripple’s significantly larger capital pool, including the 1 billion XRP fund dedicated to developers in Japan and Korea.\n\nThe program has secured backing from a formidable roster of establishment players, including Mizuho Bank, SMBC Nikko Securities, and Securitize Japan.\n\nDespite the initiative's high-profile corporate backing, it comes at a precarious moment for the network. While Ripple touts institutional adoption, the underlying usage of the XRPL tells a conflicting story of contraction.",

    "description": "JPMorgan, Citi, and Goldman Sachs are investing heavily in AI technology to transform operations, enhance productivity, and stay competitive.",
    "fullText": "JPMorgan Chase has a technology budget of $18 billion, with much of it going toward making sure it's a leader and early mover in AI.\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is a \"tremendous\" user of the bank's generative AI suite. The bank has rolled out its proprietary genAI platform to over 200,000 employees. And with about 100 more tools in the pipeline, JPMorgan is seeking to reengineer workflows for everyone from coders to portfolio managers.\n\nJPMorgan has reportedly given employees the option to use its in-house AI tools to assist in writing year-end performance reviews.\n\nExecutives at America's largest bank gave an inside look at how it's training employees to use its tools and how they're using them to deliver measurable results.\n\nDimon has previously said he's out to win the AI arms race, and he thinks JPMorgan's $2 billion AI investment has already matched its cost in savings.\n\nCitigroup has also been aggressively accelerating its AI plans. Over the summer, the bank doubled down on its AI ambitions with new leadership at the helm of its tech transformation.\n\nIn mid-October, Citi CEO Jane Fraser said that nearly 180,000 employees in 83 countries have access to the bank's proprietary AI tools and have used them almost 7 million times this year.\n\nIts generative AI tools have saved 100,000 developer hours a week with automated code reviews — \"a very meaningful productivity uplift,\" she said during the firm's third-quarter earnings call.\n\nThe bank launched the pilot of agentic AI for 5,000 colleagues in September.\n\n\"It allows complex, multi-step tasks to be completed with a single prompt, and the early results are very promising, and we'll expand access to this in the months ahead,\" said Fraser. \"Finally, we have launched a firm-wide effort to systematically embed AI in our processes end-to-end to drive further efficiencies, reduce risk, and improve client experience.\"\n\nShe also highlighted several tools to help its wealth management advisors. Citi hired an AI leader from Morgan Stanley earlier this year to help revamp its wealth technology.\n\nLike JPMorgan, Citi is also telling employees to use AI for performance reviews, Fraser recently told Bloomberg in an interview.\n\nOne of Citi's top tech executives, Shadman Zafar, outlined the bank's four-phased AI strategy and how it will \"change how we work for decades to come.\"\n\nGoldman put $6 billion behind its technology spend this year, but David Solomon, the bank's CEO, said he wished it were more.\n\nHe said he would like to be at least $8 billion, but \"I can't afford it because I've got to deliver returns,\" he said at a conference in early October.\n\nA definitive statement about how AI will affect Goldman came from a memo to employees in October announcing the third iteration of the bank's cross-bank initiative OneGS. The memo said the plan would leverage AI will drive efficiency at the firm, slow hiring, and result in a \"limited reduction\" of roles.\n\nGoldman, like its peers, has been rolling out tools, including an internal AI assistant to all employees this summer.\n\nBusiness Insider talked to employees about how they were using AI.\n\nGoldman's top partners and Solomon are eager to see AI rev up their businesses. From realizing internal productivity gains to capturing more business as clients look to raise money in anticipation of AI development and acquisitions, here's what the top echelon is expecting.\n\nThere is no AI without data, and there is no data strategy at Goldman without its chief data officer, Neema Raphael. Raphael gave Business Insider an inside look at how his roughly 500-person team melds with the rest of the bank to get the most out of its data.\n\nMorgan Stanley's CFO, Sharon Yeshaya, lifted the curtain on some of the firm's progress on AI during its earnings call last month.\n\nShe highlighted DevGen.AI, a tool that, from January to June, Business Insider previously reported, had saved developers more than 280,000 hours, or 11,666 days they would have previously dedicated to deciphering outdated code.\n\nParable, an interactive tool that analyzes and summarizes data, and LeadIQ, an AI-powered lead distribution platform that matches users of its workplace and self-directed platforms to the bank's financial advisors, were also spotlighted in the call.\n\nA survey of Morgan Stanley's interns also gave a peek into just how popular and useful AI has been for the industry's youngest cohort. ChatGPT is their favorite tool by far — with 72% of Morgan Stanley's interns said they use it daily or several times a week. The bank was early to have a partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.\n\nMorgan Stanley also spoke with Business Insider about bringing employees' AI ideas to life. Here's a look at that process.\n\nBank of America's AI rollout is also well underway.\n\nThe bank's CEO Brian Moynihan says its use of AI is already embedded across the firm, from consumer banking to institutional clients. Its virtual assistant, Erica, handled 2 million customer interactions in a single day and can now answer 700 types of questions — up from 210 a year ago. Executives said they'll share more details on the bank's AI strategy at its investor day on November 5.\n\nRob Pascal, the bank's chief experience officer, previously detailed how the bank's internal-facing AI assistant helps bankers collect, record, and review client data.",

    "description": "Jeffrey Epstein's wills named figures like Larry Summers and Jes Staley as possible executors, DOJ files show.",
    "fullText": "As he planned for his death, Jeffrey Epstein listed powerful friends and associates from Wall Street as the people who would take care of his affairs.\n\nVersions of Epstein's will released Tuesday by the Justice Department featured former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, former Barclays CEO Jes Staley, and former Bear Stearns CEO Jimmy Cayne as potential executors of his estate.\n\nThe final version of Epstein's will — which was signed in August of 2019, while he was in jail awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges in Manhattan, and shortly before he killed himself — listed his longtime personal lawyer, Darren Indyke, and accountant Richard Kahn as his estate executors.\n\nThe older versions of Epstein's will were released following the passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which required the Justice Department to make its Epstein-related files public. In addition to Epstein's 2019 indictment, his associate Ghislaine Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2021 for trafficking girls to him, and in 2008, he pleaded guilty to a crime involving sexual misconduct with a minor.\n\nThe files include references to many of Epstein's powerful associates, including President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton. Inclusion in the documents isn't an indication of wrongdoing.\n\nCayne, who died in 2021, was listed as a co-executor for Epstein's estate in versions of Epstein's will signed in 2003 and 2004. Epstein worked at Bear Stearns in the 1980s, before becoming a financial advisor to billionaires Les Wexner and Leon Black.\n\nCayne's daughter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn 2012, Epstein listed Staley — who was then an executive at JPMorgan Chase — as a backup executor to his will. In 2013, Staley was promoted to co-executor status, alongside Indyke.\n\nStaley kept the position as co-executor of Epstein's will in the 2014 version as well. By then, Epstein had listed Summers as a backup executor.\n\nAn attorney for Staley didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Staley said in a 2019 letter to a UK regulator that he did not have a close relationship with Epstein.\n\nStaley stepped down as the CEO of Barclays in 2021 following an investigation into his ties with Epstein from the British bank regulator, which banned him from working in the financial industry. A UK court earlier this year upheld Staley's ban, finding that he lied about having a \"purely professional\" relationship with Epstein.\n\nSummers stepped down from his teaching post at Harvard and from his board seat at OpenAI following the release of numerous emails between him and Epstein by the House Oversight Committee last month.\n\nSteven Goldberg, a spokesperson for Summers, said in a statement that the economist was not involved in Epstein's financial life.\n\n\"Mr. Summers had absolutely no knowledge that he was included in an early version of Epstein's will and had no involvement in his financial matters or the administration of his estate,\" Goldberg said in a statement to Business Insider.\n\nEpstein also included another prominent figure in the penultimate version of his will. A draft of the will, released by the House Oversight Committee earlier this year, listed top Goldman Sachs lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler as the backup estate executor.\n\nRuemmler, through JPMorgan, declined to comment when the will was released by the House Oversight Committee earlier this month.",

    "description": "Global investors are increasing their wagers on Chinese artificial intelligence companies, betting on the next DeepSeek and seeking to diversify, with concerns growing about a speculative bubble in the sector on Wall Street.",
    "fullText": "HONG KONG/NEW YORK, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Global investors are increasing their wagers on Chinese artificial intelligence companies, betting on the next DeepSeek and seeking to diversify, with concerns growing about a speculative bubble in the sector on Wall Street.\n\nDemand for China's AI companies is also being stimulated by ​Beijing's push for tech independence. China has fast-tracked blockbuster listings of chipmakers, notably Moore Threads (688795.SS), dubbed \"China's Nvidia\", and MetaX (688802.SS), which both debuted this month.\n\nForeigners see China closing ‌the tech gap with the U.S. as Beijing steps up support for AI chipmakers, spurring bets on Chinese companies just as worries grow over lofty valuations on U.S.-listed AI stocks.\n\nU.K.-based asset manager Ruffer, for example, said it has \"deliberately limited ‌exposure\" to the Magnificent Seven - the U.S. tech giants - and is looking to add positions in Alibaba (BABA, 9988.HK) for a bigger exposure to China's AI theme.\n\n\"While the U.S. remains the leader in frontier AI, China is rapidly narrowing the gap,\" said Gemma Cairns-Smith, Investment Specialist at Ruffer. \"The moat may not be as wide, or as deep, as many think ... The competitive landscape is shifting.\"\n\nRuffer is gaining exposure to the AI theme through Chinese tech giants such as Alibaba, which operates an AI chip unit, owns large language model Qwen, and is ploughing money into cloud infrastructure.\n\nGlobal asset managers are increasingly eyeing Chinese AI firms ⁠as a wave of startups lists on the mainland and in ‌Hong Kong, seeking to tap into surging investor appetite following the meteoric rise of DeepSeek, China’s answer to ChatGPT.\n\nUBS Global Wealth Management in a report this month rated China tech as \"most attractive\", citing investors' search for geographical diversification and China's \"strong policy backing, technological self-reliance, and rapid ‍AI monetization\".\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) currently trades at 31 times earnings, compared with a multiple of 24 for Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech (HSTECH.HK), which enables AI bets via stocks including Alibaba (BABA, 9988.HK), Baidu (BIDU, 9888.HK), Tencent (0700.HK, TCEHY) and chip foundry SMIC (0981.HK).\n\nRiding the momentum, U.S. investment adviser Rayliant helped launch a Nasdaq-listed fund in September that gives investors access to \"China's versions of stocks like Google, Meta, Tesla, Apple, and OpenAI\".\n\nKraneShares Chief Investment Officer Brendan Ahern said the ​rapid ascent of Chinese AI chipmakers such as Cambricon speaks to the scale and speed of innovation across China's AI and semiconductor industries.",

    "description": "Tuesday's flurry of delayed data releases could fill in gaps in Wall Street's picture of the economy.",
    "fullText": "US stocks tipped higher on Tuesday after fresh data showed surprisingly strong growth in the US economy over the summer, leading investors to trim bets on near-term interest-rate cuts.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) both rose around 0.4%, with the benchmark index vying for a fresh record close. The blue-chip benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained around 0.2%. The turn higher came after the major gauges on Monday notched their third win in a row.\n\nGold (GC=F) and silver (SI=F) continued to pick up steam through Tuesday morning, adding to a stunning rally that has the precious metals on pace for their best year in more than four decades. At the same time, copper (HG=F) crested a fresh record above $12,000 per ton.\n\nTuesday brought a last gasp of data ahead of the Christmas holiday. Wall Street got a first look at third quarter GDP, which showed the US economy grew at a 4.3% annualized rate in the quarter. That was much higher than the 3.3% expected, a potential sign of continued economic resilience. The shutdown-delayed report also found that consumer spending remained strong over the summer.\n\nAfter the release, traders pared bets on a rate cut in January. Markets now price in over 85% odds of the Federal Reserve standing pat, up from 80% a day ago and 75% last week. That said, a plurality of wagers remain on two cuts by the end of next year.\n\nBut Tuesday morning's read on December consumer confidence from the Conference Board showed the measure declining for a fifth consecutive month, as consumers' poor economic vibes persist.\n\nWall Street stocks have rallied back in recent days, after last week's data — including a surprise drop in inflation and lukewarm look at labor market — left bets on 2026 interest-rate cuts mostly intact.\n\nOn the corporate front, Novo Nordisk's (NVO) US-listed stock jumped in premarket after the Danish drugmaker got official US approval to market its Wegovy weight-loss pill.\n\nLooking ahead, US stock markets will wrap up trading early on Wednesday and be closed all day Thursday for the Christmas holiday.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Monday that he sees room to revise the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target and move to a range-based system instead.\n\nSpeaking on the \"All-In Podcast\" on Monday, Bessent said, “Once we are back to [2%] — which I think will be in sight — then we can have a discussion: Is it much smarter to have a range?”\n\nThe US inflation target, set in 2012 at 2%, constitutes one-half of the Fed's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability, driven by maintaining a long-term stable inflation mark.\n\n10-year Treasurys (^TNX) ticked up by roughly 0.2% through the first half of Tuesday, while the Intercontinental Exchange's US Dollar index (DX-Y.NYB) moved down by the same amount.\n\nBessent's comments come after a delayed release of the November Consumer Price Index showed that prices increased by 2.7% over the year prior, compared to consensus estimates of 3.1%. So-called core\" CPI — which strips out the more volatile food and energy categories — rose by 2.6% against economist estimates of 3%.\n\nShares in US mining companies with copper (HG=F) operations are rising after the metal crested $12,000 per ton for the first time ever on Tuesday morning, setting an all-time high as President Trump's tariff policies and a string of mine accidents have roiled supply chains.\n\nFreeport-McMoRan (FCX), whose Grasberg copper mine in Indonesia was taken nearly completely offline earlier in the year after a deadly mudslide that left several workers dead, traded up by 1.4% in the first minutes after the opening bell. Fellow mining giants BHP Group (BHP) and Teck Resources (TECK) gained 0.4% and 2.5%, respectively.\n\nShares in Southern Copper (SCCO), one of the US's major copper operators, moved in the opposite direction, falling by roughly 0.4%.\n\nThe year has been strong for metals across the board. Prices on copper itself are up more than 37% year to date, while hot-rolled coil steel (HRC=F) and aluminum (ALI=F) have climbed by 32% and 17%, respectively, according to data from Trading Economics.\n\nWhile geopolitics have played a role, Trump's tariff regime has also sent copper and other metals prices soaring, dragging mining stocks along with it.\n\nWhen Trump announced plans in July to impose tariffs on copper, traders rushed to move physical copper stores out of warehouses overseas and back into the US to avoid these duties, which sent prices soaring. When the administration clarified that these tariffs would not apply to raw copper ore, prices came back down.\n\nUnder current policy, semi-finished products and copper-intensive goods, such as wiring or tubes, are covered under an identical 50% tariff, although raw copper ores are excluded. Imports of both steel and aluminum are currently subject to a 50% tariff.\n\nUS consumers remained pessimistic about the current state of the economy at the start of December, according to data from the Conference Board.\n\nThe Conference Board's consumer confidence reading dropped 3.8 points to 89.1 in December from November's upwardly revised reading of 92.9, marking the fifth month in a row that consumer confidence weakened.\n\nConsumers' views on current business conditions were negative for the first time since September 2024, the report said. Survey respondents cited ongoing concerns, such as inflation, tariffs, and politics, although other topics, including immigration, war, and personal finance, also became more salient.\n\nAt the same time, consumers' expectations for inflation 12 months from now retreated after increasing in November. Consumers also had the most positive view of where stock prices are headed a year from now since January.\n\nOverall, households reported feeling mildly negative about their family's current financial situation, but turned slightly more optimistic about future conditions. Many reported putting off big-ticket purchases, as Americans reported spending more on necessities and cheap thrills than on expensive discretionary items.\n\nCloud software maker ServiceNow (NOW) has reached an agreement to acquire the cybersecurity company Armis in a $7.75 billion deal, the company announced Tuesday morning.\n\nThe transaction, an all-cash deal that ServiceNow said it will finance with both cash on hand and debt, will be ServiceNow's largest acquisition to date, according to Bloomberg. Shares in ServiceNow fell by roughly 2.6% after the announcement.\n\nThe acquisition is intended to broaden ServiceNow's cybersecurity offerings in its cloud products, the company said in its press release. Armis' security offerings will allow enterprise customers in industries with \"cyber-physical\" assets, such as healthcare and manufacturing, to get a more real-time assessment of potential threats, ServiceNow said.\n\n\"In the agentic AI era, intelligent trust and governance that span any cloud, any asset, any AI system, and any device are non-negotiable if companies want to scale AI for the long-term,\" ServiceNow president, COO, and chief product officer Amit Zavery said.\n\n\"Together with Armis, we will deliver an industry-defining strategic cybersecurity shield for real-time, end-to-end proactive protection across all technology estates.\"\n\nUS stocks opened Tuesday's trading on unstable footing after GDP data showed stronger-than-expected growth in the US economy through the summer, leading investors to pull back from bets on near-term cuts from the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell by roughly 0.2% in the most volatile move of the morning, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ticked up by less than 0.1% each following the third win in a row for US stocks to start the week.\n\nCopper (HG=F) set a fresh record on Tuesday morning, crossing $12,000 per ton for the first time, while gold (GC=F) and silver (SI=F) continued to pick up steam, adding onto a stunning rally that has the precious metals on pace for their best year in more than four decades.\n\nBefore the opening bell on Tuesday, investors got a reading on third quarter GDP, which showed the US economy grew at a 4.3% annualized rate in the quarter, above the expected 3.3% growth. Predictions of a rate cut at the January Federal Reserve meeting fell in the aftermath, with traders pricing in only a 13% chance.\n\nUS gross domestic product (GDP) unexpectedly accelerated in the third quarter, coming in at an annualized pace of 4.3%, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported on Tuesday.\n\nEconomists had expected the initial reading of annualized growth to slow to a 3% pace from last quarter's 3.8% reading, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nThe reading showed resilience in consumer spending and exports, though investments decreased, the BEA said. Imports, which are subtracted from the calculation of GDP, also declined.\n\nEconomists have noted that the economy has looked increasingly K-shaped, with higher-income households propping up spending while lower-income households become more financially stressed.\n\nThe advance GDP reading was originally scheduled to be released on Oct. 30, with a second estimate scheduled for Nov. 26, but the data was delayed due to the government shutdown.\n\nTom Hale, the CEO of Oura, which makes the popular health tracking ring, doesn't think a new hardware device from OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) will make the Apple (AAPL) iPhone obsolete, he told Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi. Hale said it would have a long way to go to drive mass appeal.\n\n\"We've all had [Amazon] Alexa devices in our lives, and they're fascinating, ... but it's also kind of latent in the sort of bandwidth for information,\" Hale said in a new episode of Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast. \"I'm fascinated by conversations that you have with OpenAI or any of the models like Gemini. ... At the same time, it's not the perfect user interface for every kind of computing activity you might consult.\"\n\nHale added that he doesn't think the iPhone will go away, just as the iPhone didn't fully replace laptops or desktops.\n\n\"It's just another form factor for computing,\" he said. \"I think that's where the device goes, and I think that we'll have a cloud of wearables that'll be tuned to whatever your use case is.\"\n\nThe US dollar is on track to hit its weakest annual performance since 2017, according to the Bloomberg Dollar Index.\n\nAST SpaceMobile (ASTS) stock fell 3% before the bell on Tuesday, following a surge on Monday. The Starlink rival's stock closed 14% up on Monday. AST's gains follow President Trump's signing of an executive order last week to secure America's \"space superiority.\"\n\nCACI (CACI) stock edged higher on Tuesday, rising 1% during premarket trading, following the announcement on Monday that the US defense contractor will acquire space technology provider ​ARKA Group from funds managed by ‌Blackstone Tactical Opportunities for $2.6 billion.\n\nCarnival Corporation (CCL) stock rose 1% before the bell on Tuesday, following the cruise liner posting positive Q4 earnings results on Friday, beating Wall Street expectations and resuming dividend payments.\n\nMilitary shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) saw its stock rise 4% during premarket trading on Tuesday and closed 5% up in the prior day's trading after the US Navy announced it had selected Huntington to design and build a new class of warship.\n\n“We look forward to supporting the Navy on this critical program,” said Chris Kastner, HII president and CEO.\n\nPresident Trump also said on Monday that he had approved a plan for the US Navy to construct new \"Trump-class\" warships to serve as flagships for the nation's naval fleet.\n\nRivals to Huntington saw their stock close higher yesterday, such as General Dynamics (GD), which saw its shares rise almost 2% on Monday, and Australian company Austal (ASB.AX), which has a major presence in the US, saw its shares close 6% higher on Tuesday.\n\nShares of Novo Nordisk jumped before the bell on Tuesday after the FDA approved its weight-loss pill on Monday.\n\nThe green light for oral Wegovy gives the Danish drugmaker a boost as looks to claw back ground lost to US rival Eli Lilly (LLY). Novo has seen a rocky 2025 of sliding shares, profit warnings, and slowing sales of its injectable Wegovy amid intensifying competition, including from compounded versions.",

    "fullText": "Before he ever worked in finance, Cardinez thought he'd play professional football. When that didn't happen, he found a way to remain close to the action — interning at Madison Square Garden, joining the 2014 Super Bowl host committee, and completing the NFL's rotational program across media, business development, and strategy.\n\nHe thought he'd stay there and ascend the ranks. But he decided on a different path that seemed to align more with his interests: finance.\n\nAfter earning his MBA and working in investment banking, he joined Blue Owl's HomeCourt Partners, a fund established with the NBA to buy minority stakes in teams.\n\nCardinez has since worked on multiple franchise deals, including the Phoenix Suns' $4 billion sale and a 2024 transaction involving the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nKress' path to high finance began in academic research, studying anthropology and psychology at Notre Dame and conducting fieldwork in Sierra Leone before pursuing graduate work on Angola's energy sector at the University of Oxford. She later worked at political research and consultancy firm, Eurasia Group, training investors to integrate geopolitical risk into decision-making.\n\nKress came to BlackRock first as an advisor to Tom Donilon, the former US national security advisor, a post she called a \"dream job.\" She helped Donilon elevate the firm's geopolitics function into a permanent part of the BlackRock Investment Institute.\n\nBut she didn't stop there. This year, Kress was named the chief of staff to Larry Fink, the firm's powerful CEO. She told Business Insider that this new job was the \"culmination\" of her career, offering \"unparalleled exposure\" to global policymakers and business leaders.\n\nJack Levendoski, JPMorgan Chase\n\nLevendoski grew up all over the world — from Louisiana to London, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Australia — before beginning his career as a facilities engineering project manager at Chevron.\n\nIn that role, he supported offshore oil and gas work in the Gulf of Mexico. Levendoski later moved into investment banking and is now an executive director in JPMorgan's M&A group, advising on high-profile technology and software transactions.\n\nMenasche admits he didn't always feel like a natural fit for the finance industry — he didn't grow up in a household of bankers, he said, and he studied chemistry and math at Cambridge. But after trying academic research, he found the lab's pace too slow. That realization led him to roles that blended analytical work with more day-to-day momentum, eventually steering him into secondaries.\n\nToday, Menasche is a managing director and global cohead of Goldman Sachs' private capital and liquidity solutions group, working across real estate, infrastructure, private equity, and venture capital transactions.\n\nJackie Shepherd, Morgan Stanley\n\nBefore joining the ranks of Wall Street, Shepherd spent years competing in Division I golf, earning a full-ride scholarship and captaining the University of Minnesota's team. She began her career in accounting at EY's international tax practice, where she first encountered investment banking.\n\n\"I didn't realize that there was an intersection between the two,\" she told Business Insider. \"I wanted to be the person coming up with more of the cool ideas.\" So she made the pivot to Wall Street.\n\nAfter holding roles at Goldman Sachs and Citi, she joined Morgan Stanley's separations and structured solutions group. Shepherd has worked on roughly $250 billion in transactions, including Comcast's pending carve-out of its cable networks.\n\nGolf, she said, remains a key part of her life, adding that aspires to play on all seven continents.",

I just want to see some noticeable returns on all these massive AI projects. I'm not screaming about an AI bubble, but my palms get a little sweaty thinking about the ever-growing tech budgets. So, give us all some relief by showing that these AI tools are going to generate revenue.\n\nA solution to Wall Street's recruiting cycle. The worst thing that could happen to a junior banker is finding out their favorite Murray Hill brunch spot has shut down. The second-worst thing happened this year when big banks fought back against PE's early recruitment of them. The result upended a Wall Street tradition aspiring financiers had spent years preparing for. I was never a fan of the process, but the change left us in a weird no-man's land where none of the rules are apparent.\n\nPrediction markets predict their future. With a string of recent media partnerships, we're going to see a lot more data from prediction markets in 2026. Meanwhile, some state regulators aren't so pleased with their rise. So let's settle the debate. I'd like prediction markets to set a market speculating on their own future. Let the people decide!\n\nNo more media blackouts, please. I can't go through another two weeks of no sports because of carriage disputes. I know how this story ends (the customer paying more), and I also know there's nothing I can do about it. So just rip the bandage off, and let's avoid the grandstanding going forward.\n\nProtein, chill out. No food group is on a hotter run than the muscle-building nutrient. But it's flying too close to the sun. We've got protein in hot cocoa now?? I'm a self-admitted gym bro, and I know my whey around a protein shake (I hate myself for that joke), but even I need to put my foot down. Besides, overconsumption of protein could have a painful conclusion for some of us: kidney stones.\n\nThe New York Knicks to reach the NBA finals. I'm not even asking for a title!\n\nThe New York Jets to play a meaningful game in December. Even Santa has his limits",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame said the US needs to shift away from \"power-hungry\" chips, but Nvidia has a \"death grip\" on the sector.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry says Nvidia is pushing the idea that building graphics chips that consume more and more power is the best path to advancing AI — and the result could be the US losing the AI race to China.\n\n\"Exactly and sadly,\" Burry wrote on X late Saturday, responding to another user's comment that called Nvidia the \"gangster of the AI neighborhood\" as it has \"shut down any narrative that even hints at reducing GPU demand.\"\n\nIn another post over the weekend, Burry shared a chart showing China has more than double America's electric generation capacity, and is expanding its energy infrastructure at a much faster rate.\n\nWhy China will win AI in one chart. \n\nPower hungry Nvidia chips are not the way forward for the U.S. \n\nIt is not just the total power advantage. It is the slope. pic.twitter.com/qNXh1e4lZj\n\nNvidia has framed AI innovation as \"just figuring out how to power and to cool bigger, hotter silicon,\" Burry said. But China's huge lead in building out power sources means companies in the US are \"plowing capital into a race it is structurally positioned to lose.\"\n\nBurry said the US needs to shift its focus from developing more and more \"power hungry\" chips toward advancing \"AI-tuned ASICs\" — application-specific integrated circuits that are designed to do a particular task quickly and efficiently.\n\nBut he said Nvidia has a \"death grip on development\" thanks to its deals with many key players in the AI industry.\n\nNvidia did not immediately reply to a request for comment from Business Insider about Burry's posts.\n\nNvidia stock has surged more than 12-fold since the start of 2023, making it the world's most valuable public company, with a market capitalization of $4.4 trillion.\n\nThe chipmaker raked in about $148 billion of revenue and $77 billion of net income in the first nine months of this year. \"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in the third-quarter earnings release.\n\nBurry, whose contrarian bet against the US housing bubble was chronicled in the book and movie \"The Big Short,\" recently pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack.\n\nHe has made the case to his readers that Nvidia and other AI companies are inflating a historic tech bubble. He has said that Nvidia's customers have exaggerated the lifespan of its chips to drag out depreciation and boost short-term earnings.\n\nBurry has also called out the \"give-and-take\" deals between Nvidia and chip buyers such as OpenAI and Oracle, and criticized Nvidia's stock-based compensation as excessive.\n\nNvidia previously responded to his critiques in a memo to Wall Street analysts that was quickly leaked. Burry fired back that the document featured \"one straw man after another\" and he stood by his analysis.\n\nReplying to a subsequent comment on his Substack, Burry wrote that Nvidia had \"become too much of a focus.\" While the company's response did make him \"think to look a little deeper,\" he said it was a \"relatively small short\" for him.\n\n\"I believe it will fall, and is a pure play on my overall thesis, but it is not the worst out there.\"",

    "fullText": "The AI tech trade isn't over. Investors have just become choosier about which players might emerge as winners heading into 2026.\n\nTech (XLK) stocks have been on a rollercoaster recently as concerns over funding for Oracle (ORCL) data centers and construction delays from CoreWeave (CRWV) rattled AI plays.\n\n\"I do believe these are all hyper-valid concerns for the theme, and with the market now breaking out the 'scrutiny scalpel' we are finally seeing appropriate 'winners and losers' dispersion, and that's a good thing,\" Nomura Securities equity derivatives analyst Charlie McElligott wrote in a note on Thursday.\n\nHowever, Micron Technology's (MU) blockbuster results sparked a rebound in AI trades. The memory chipmaker beat Wall Street estimates on Q1 revenue and EPS, helped by AI-fueled demand.\n\nMcElligott compared Micron's earnings' \"upside shock\" to Nvidia's (NVDA) results in May 2023, which acted as a catalyst for the broader AI boom.\n\n\"Point-being, there is still blood left in this AI stone,\" McElligott wrote.\n\nInvestors have been watching for potential funding risks within the AI trade after Oracle stock fell following a Financial Times report that Blue Owl Capital would not support Oracle's $10 billion data center project.\n\nThe concerns are particularly notable given the market concentration among the largest tech companies in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts forecast S&P 500 earnings growth of over 12% in 2026, largely driven by the top seven stocks in the index. Those include Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Broadcom (AVGO), and Meta (META). Together, they account for roughly a quarter of the index's earnings.\n\nMeanwhile, the \"Magnificent 7\" tech players are up an average of 21% this year, compared with a 16% gain for the S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\nSevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye told Yahoo Finance he expects to see winners and losers within the group heading into next year.\n\n\"I think we're going to see some pretty massive bifurcation,\" Essaye said.\" The next evolution of this trade, where there are going to be winners and losers within the Mag 7.\"\n\nHe said that his favorite stock is Alphabet because of the growth prospects for Google's Gemini artificial intelligence product.\n\n\"I think companies like Oracle that are not overextended financially, but are sort of raising eyebrows with a lot of the spending that AI, I think that companies like that could struggle,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "Palantir (PLTR) trades at 552 times trailing earnings and 175 times forward earnings. Bank of America set a $255 price target.\n\nMichael Burry bought $9.2 million in Palantir put options at a $50 strike price expiring in 2027.\n\nPalantir maintains a 50% free cash flow margin with full-year FCF estimated at $2.1 billion.\n\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nMichael Burry has been butting heads with the bulls on Wall Street, specifically regarding Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR). The bulls have won big so far, and the price targets have gotten even bolder. On the other hand, most analysts are sitting on the fence with a \"Hold\" rating, with three analysts having \"Sell\" ratings on the stock. There are four \"Strong Buy\" ratings, with the highest price target at $255, from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).\n\nBurry believes PLTR stock may be on the cusp of an implosion, with his bearish thesis focusing on the sky-high valuation of the stock. PLTR stock trades at 156 times trailing sales and at 552 times trailing earnings. It still trades at 175 times next year's expected earnings, which is an unprecedented valuation that no other big tech stock has seen since the Dot Com era.\n\nThis may be old news by now, but it's worth a refresher before we get to the meat.\n\nBurry holds put options on approximately 5 million Palantir shares, with a notional value of around $912 million. This is the largest bearish bet in his portfolio and constitutes 66% of his reported holdings. The true amount involved is much lower. Burry himself posted on X, saying that he spent $9.2 million buying 50,000 put options on Palantir.\n\nThese options expire in 2027 at a strike price of $50. Burry is betting that PLTR stock will decline well below $50, allowing him to sell higher at the strike price when it expires.\n\nRegardless, this is a drop in the bucket compared to how much Burry's spending power. The notional value did lead to dramatic headlines and lured in comments from Palantir CEO Alex Karp, who called Burry \"batshit crazy\" during an interview.\n\nThe bulls' argument is essentially that Palantir is an extraordinary company that deserves an extraordinary valuation. It has managed to grow significantly after getting its foot in the door at any company/agency. What truly makes this growth special is that the company has a free cash flow margin of nearly 50%. For a company believed to be early on in its growth cycle, Palantir is truly exceptional.",

    "description": "Sergio Avedian started his career as a Wall Street trader before becoming a rideshare driver. Now, he makes videos for The Rideshare Guy on YouTube.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sergio Avedian, a 58-year-old ride-hailing driver for Uber and Lyft in Southern California. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was born in Istanbul, Turkey, to Armenian parents. I went to high school in Germany and later came to the US for college.\n\nI was always interested in finance, so I ended up becoming a trader at a boutique Wall Street firm. I saw the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. After I retired from my day job in 2005, I was looking for things to keep myself occupied. Algorithms fascinated me because I had seen widespread automation in the world of finance.\n\nIn 2016, I was getting lunch with a friend who was telling me about this app called Uber. My friend said, \"I think they use algorithms.\" Curiosity got the better of me, and I started reading about it and meeting drivers to learn more. Eventually, I signed up as a driver myself in the Los Angeles area.\n\nBack then, Uber was offering $1,000 bonuses to sign up as a driver. I also earned up to $80 an hour.\n\nBut what really intrigued me were the parallels with trading. On Wall Street, we used to say that \"a trend is your friend\" because you could make money if you caught one early enough.\n\nPicking ride-share trips was like that. You had to know when and where trip prices would surge. That meant, for example, I had to position myself in Santa Monica between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., because prices would usually be higher there at that time.\n\nI've also spent the last several years writing articles for and making videos with Harry Campbell, who has a YouTube channel called The Rideshare Guy. I've been working with Harry since about 2018, with a break during COVID when demand for rides went down.\n\nI think Uber, Lyft, and the other gig work apps are wonderful. They've created massive opportunities for people. But I also don't want the people who make these services work each day to get left behind. The people who do this work need to start saving for their future.\n\nThat's why my latest project is a personal finance website and YouTube channel. It's not just for gig workers, but they're a big part of the audience. They don't have access to the same benefits that employees do, such as retirement benefits.\n\nOne piece of advice I've been giving drivers: At the end of your shift, do one extra trip, then put the money from that trip in an account and don't touch it. You can even put it in an index fund or another investment that will appreciate over time.\n\nDrivers need to think about investing more than ever, given how self-driving cars are expanding.\n\nI'm exploring the creation of an investment trust to own some of these cars — similar to a REIT that owns malls — that drivers can also invest in. I want them to have skin in the game and earn some passive income.\n\nI also put together a petition asking Uber and Lyft to pay their drivers a one-time \"Thank you\" bonus.\n\nBoth companies have made lots of money, especially over the last few years. Uber became profitable thanks to efforts such as upfront pricing, and Lyft has made a turnaround. Uber announced a $20 billion stock buyback program this year. Why can't we make drivers' lives better and create a sense of loyalty with a one-time payment like this?\n\nI've spoken to the CEOs of these companies because of my work for The Rideshare Guy, so I know they'll listen. Will they actually do it?\n\nOne thing I've learned in my time in the rideshare community is that the companies can do the right thing. In 2023, I worked with Pablo Gomez, another driver in Los Angeles, to get California's treasurer to update some of the reimbursement rates under Prop 22 — the state's pay law for gig workers — which led Uber to pay millions of dollars to drivers.\n\nIf Pablo hadn't mentioned that issue to me, I'd have had no clue about it, and we might have never gotten it fixed.\n\nI want to open the door for some different ideas about how we can benefit drivers.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "Palm Beach is buzzing with Wall Street energy this winter. Here's our insider guide to the hotspots.",
    "description": "Wall Street arrived in Palm Beach early this winter. From Milos to Mary Lou's, these restaurants and nightlife spots are leading the scene.",
    "fullText": "Ask me about the ZIP code 33480, and I'll have plenty to say.\n\nIt's Palm Beach, a place I know well. I grew up in South Florida, and even now, I spend a good amount of time here, watching how the island continues to evolve. It also happens to overlap with my job: as a Wall Street reporter, many of the firms we cover — from Goldman Sachs to Citadel — have built out significant \"Wall Street South\" operations in and around Palm Beach County over the past few years.\n\nThis winter, locals tell me the island feels especially busy — noticeably earlier than usual. Restaurants are filling up weeks ahead of the holidays, reservations are disappearing quickly, and the finance crowd is playing a noticeable role, restaurant insiders say.\n\n\"We've never seen the island this full this early in the season,\" Alex Melillo, a partner at Mary Lou's, one of West Palm's newest and hottest nightlife venues, told me.\n\nTo get a broader sense of where people are actually going, I asked around. In addition to speaking with restaurant operators and longtime denizens of \"the Island,\" I checked in with some local contacts in finance: a money manager who works for a large bank and a trusted friend who works in private asset management.\n\nIn my conversations, the same names kept coming up — places where Wall Streeters, finance professionals, and winter visitors congregate when they're here.\n\nI recently had a meal at Buccan and wasn't disappointed. Unlike many popular Palm Beach hot spots that lean old-world, the space feels particularly modern, matching the restaurant's more cosmopolitan approach to dining.\n\nThe menu is built around avant-garde plates meant for sharing, with dishes that change seasonally but often include standouts like hamachi tiradito, inventive crudos, and rich pastas.\n\nWhen I went with a friend, we split the sweet corn agnolotti — and it's an absolute must. The room draws a lively mix of locals and visiting professionals, and it's the kind of place where dinners tend to stretch. Next door is Imoto, Buccan's sister restaurant, a sleek sushi spot if you're craving Japanese.\n\nCucina is often the first stop when my friends and I are looking for a fun night out.\n\nIt's Palm Beach's playground, an island favorite for seeing and being seen — and a place that tends to extend a simple dinner into a much longer affair when the music comes on. Specialized lights illuminate the ceiling in keeping with the DJ's beat. Tables feel like prime real estate, and the room gets even more packed as the evening goes on.\n\nOn busy nights, it's clear this is where a large cross-section of Palm Beach society — including professionals from out of town — has descended. The door can be selective, but once you're inside, the expectation is that you'll stay awhile and dance. I recommend stopping by Lola 41 around the corner for a drink first.\n\nEstiatorio Milos opened earlier this year on the West Palm Beach waterfront, bringing one of the most respected names in Mediterranean seafood to South Florida. The restaurant has the same bright, luminous aesthetic found at other Milos locations — including Hudson Yards — with fresh fish displayed on ice and a glowing bar that makes an ideal backdrop for conversation on a buzzy night.\n\nAside from Avra in Sunny Isles, this may be the best Greek restaurant in South Florida right now. A must-order for the table is the Milos chips — paper-thin zucchini and eggplant, lightly fried and genuinely impossible to resist — alongside simply prepared whole fish grilled with lemon and olive oil.\n\nIf you're craving a taste of Manhattan — or Paris — in Palm Beach, La Goulue has become one of the island's most popular destinations. The South Florida offshoot of the classic Upper East Side French restaurant serves familiar staples like cheese soufflé, lobster bisque, and rich French onion soup, drawing a steady mix of locals and winter visitors.\n\nIt's rarely quiet. \"I was passing by La Goulue the other day, and there wasn't an empty seat,\" said Daphne Nikolopoulos, editor in chief of Palm Beach Illustrated, a popular glossy title in the area. The restaurant has become a dependable choice for everything from long family dinners to client meals — the kind of place finance and business guests return to repeatedly once they're settled in town for the season.\n\nAn Upper East Side mainstay that opened in Palm Beach in 2021, Le Bilboquet has become a dependable stop for winter visitors looking for a taste of home. The French bistro serves its signature dishes — including cajun chicken, tuna tartare, and Dover sole — in a setting that works just as well for long lunches as for leisurely dinners.\n\nThe restaurant has been especially busy this season. \"We're certainly seeing a strong presence from the finance and business community this winter,\" a spokesperson for the restaurant told me. They said they've also seen an increase in group meals and celebrations, \"including more corporate and business dinners, often with groups of eight to 10 guests,\" tied to end-of-year and holiday gatherings.\n\nIf you're interested in a memorable night out, Mary Lou's, which opened this year to much fanfare, is arguably the area's hottest ticket. Inside, you'll find a space that's dark and sultry, anchored by a dramatic chandelier over the bar and a massive disco ball overhead. Visiting celebrities often pass through, tucked into the discrete banquettes along the wall.\n\nMelillo, one of Mary Lou's three partners, said the season has ramped up earlier than usual, driven in large part by visiting finance and corporate guests who are spending longer stretches in Palm Beach and going out more frequently. For Wall Streeters and the local professional crowd, the environment feels inviting but still upscale. Expect to see well-dressed partiers in sport jackets and toasting with free-flowing libations.\n\nJoe Cervasio, the partner who oversees programming, said the venue has leaned into booking touring DJs and festival-level talent as demand has grown.\n\n\"I cannot hold enough champagne — it's literally falling through our fingertips,\" Melillo said.\n\nReservations are strongly recommended.\n\nOne of the most talked-about openings on Palm Beach Island this season is The Polo Room, the new restaurant led by internationally known polo player Nacho Figueras. The menu is inspired by the legendary polo star's Argentinian roots.\n\nNot to be mistaken for an offshoot of a separate restaurant — Ralph Lauren's Polo Bar on 55th Street in Midtown — the space opened in early December and has quickly drawn attention from locals and winter visitors. It features an equestrian aesthetic throughout.\n\n\"Without question, The Polo Room is fantastic,\" said Nikolopoulos, who was one of the new restaurant's first customers. \"Figueras doesn't do anything halfway — he's meticulous and very professional with all his endeavors.\"\n\nShe said the food stood out, pointing to the empanadas and steaks in particular, and noted that Figueras has incorporated family recipes into the menu — like his mom's signature chocolate mousse for dessert.",

    "title": "Airlines are cracking down on power banks. Here's how you can avoid adding to the growing number of lithium battery accidents on planes.",
    "description": "Incidents involving lithium batteries are getting more common, so airlines are getting stricter about power banks due to the fire risk.",
    "fullText": "In late January, an Airbus A321 was running 20 minutes behind schedule as it prepared to taxi at Gimhae International Airport in Busan, South Korea.\n\nThen, a fire broke out in an overhead bin.\n\nThe inflatable slides were deployed as all 176 people evacuated the Air Busan plane, although 27 of them were injured. The aircraft was destroyed by the flames.\n\nAuthorities later said the fire was likely caused by a power bank after its insulation broke down.\n\nSince then, 2025 has seen such devices come under sharp focus for aviation safety.\n\nPower banks, laptops, and phones are all powered by lithium batteries. They pose a fire risk due to a process called thermal runaway: If the battery is damaged or overcharged, it can spark a chain reaction and a rapid rise in temperature.\n\nTwo weeks after the incident in Busan, South Korea's transport ministry announced a ban on storing power banks and e-cigarettes in the overhead bins. It also said they could no longer be charged using a plane's USB ports.\n\nSeveral airlines around the world have also introduced similar rules this year.\n\nThat includes Southwest Airlines, which did so in late May. One day later, a smoking battery charger caused a Southwest flight to divert an hour into its journey from Baltimore to Tampa.\n\nBut while the Air Busan fire appears to have prompted the wider crackdown, incidents involving lithium batteries had already become more common.\n\nAs of mid-December, the Federal Aviation Administration has recorded 80 verified incidents this year, and 89 in 2024. Before the pandemic, there were no more than 50 in any year.\n\nThat means it's gone from happening less than once a week to around every four days on average.\n\nOne reason such incidents have become more common is simply that more people own more electronic devices.\n\nHowever, airlines appear to be particularly concerned about power banks.\n\nThe growing market means that many of them are cheaply made and not properly certified. They may also lack the advanced circuitry that helps stop laptops and phones from overcharging.\n\nRising incident numbers prompted the FAA to issue a safety alert in early September. It recommended that airlines review their firefighting processes and their safety messages to passengers.\n\nThat includes educating travelers and ensuring their devices are kept visible and accessible.\n\nThis means that smoke or a fire can be spotted more quickly than if the device were in an overhead bin.\n\nEven if you're flying with an airline that hasn't mandated it, it's safer to make sure your device is visible while in use, so flight attendants can react if anything goes wrong.\n\nAirline crews are well-trained in dealing with fires. Incidents recorded by the FAA this year have seen flight attendants handle smoking power banks with specialized containment bags, fire extinguishers, and by submerging them in water.\n\nIf you notice your power bank swelling, hissing, or smelling like chemicals, stop using it immediately.\n\nAustralian airlines are the latest to introduce new rules, taking effect in mid-December.\n\nIt follows a July incident where a power bank caught fire in the overhead bin of a Virgin Australia flight. The plane landed safely, though one person was treated for smoke inhalation.\n\nAnd in November, around 150 people were evacuated from a Qantas lounge at Melbourne Airport when a man was burned by a power bank that caught fire in his pocket.\n\nWhile Southwest Airlines is so far the only major US carrier to tighten its power bank rules, other incidents indicate a heightened awareness.\n\nThis fall, two transatlantic United Airlines flights U-turned after a passenger dropped their laptop down the side of their seat and into the cargo hold.\n\nSince the devices were inaccessible, crews might not have known if they had caught fire until it was too late. That's especially risky while flying over an ocean with nowhere to land, so they diverted out of an excess of caution to retrieve the laptops.\n\nTraveling by air has only become the safest form of transport since regulators have learned from different incidents over the years.\n\nUPS Airlines suffered its first fatal crash in 2010, when a fire broke out on board a Boeing 747 shortly after departing Dubai.\n\nFlight 6 was carrying more than 80,000 lithium batteries, which ignited. Thick smoke entered the flight deck, obscuring the pilots' vision, and the captain passed out. With fire-damaged controls, the first officer was unable to direct the plane back to the airport.\n\nIn their final report, investigators made 36 safety recommendations. Regulators imposed stricter rules on how lithium batteries could be packaged and shipped, and banned them as cargo on passenger flights.\n\nIn 2012, the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization reinforced its existing ban on spare lithium batteries from checked baggage. The following year, it made clear that power banks also fall under this category.\n\nAs power banks continue to start smoking on flights, and since the FAA's safety alert, it's likely that more airlines will tighten their rules.",

    "fullText": "A storied Wall Street law firm that hemorrhaged talent after bending the knee to President Donald Trump has announced plans to merge with a much larger firm in a bid to save its practice.\n\nCadwalader, Wickersham & Taft had been actively looking for a merger partner after many of its top attorneys left over the firm’s decision to pledge $100 million in pro bono work to support the president’s priorities, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nLast spring, the president signed a series of executive orders stripping attorneys from certain firms of their security clearances, limiting their access to government buildings, and terminating government contracts with the firms.\n\nWhile some firms like Cadwalader made deals with the administration to avoid a similar punishment, others fought the orders and won big in court, adding to the humiliation of the capitulating firms.\n\nIn the wake of the firm’s deal with Trump, key partner groups at Cadwalader, which was founded in 1792 and is Wall Street’s oldest firm, quickly began making lateral moves to other practices, Above the Law reported.\n\nThe firm, which brings in about $638 million in annual revenue, is now merging with Hogan Lovells, which brought in nearly $3 billion last year, more than quadruple the size of Cadwalader, according to Above the Law.\n\nHogan Lovells’ chief executive, Miguel Zaldivar Jr., will lead the combined firm, according to the Journal. Cadwalader’s current co-managing partners will be relegated to the new firm’s management committee.\n\nPartners at both firms still need to vote to finalize the merger next year.\n\nThe deal is being described as the legal industry’s largest-ever merger, creating a $3.6 billion megafirm with more than 3,000 lawyers, according to the Journal.\n\nHogan Lovells is headquartered in London and Washington, D.C.\n\nCommenting on the merger, Zaldivar said Wall Street had long been the firm’s “missing piece,” telling the Journal, “We felt that we needed to consolidate our position with a strong finance practice in New York.”\n\n“It’s a deal that makes perfect sense,” he added.\n\nDespite being burned by its prior dealings with Trump, Cadwalader co-managing partner Pat Quinn reaffirmed the company’s commitment to pro bono legal work in a statement shared by Reuters.\n\nHowever, he declined to say whether the firm’s previous deal with the administration would apply to the merged firm.\n\nLast year, another famous Wall Street firm, Shearman & Sterling, merged with Allen & Overy to create a $3.4 billion business. Chicago-based firm Winston & Strawn also announced plans on Monday to merge with U.K. practice Taylor Wessing in 2026.",

    "description": "Bank of America was among the first to flag a \"run-it-hot\" scenario for the US economy, defined by robust growth and above-target inflation.",
    "fullText": "The US economy will keep burning hot in 2026, extending a yearslong run of dodging a recession.\n\nThat's a view that is increasingly being woven into consensus forecasts on Wall Street, where top researchers have generally brushed off the risks of a near-term recession and are anticipating another year of stable economic growth and hot inflation.\n\nBank of America dubbed this the \"run-it-hot\" scenario for the US economy back in September, and others have since adopted the phrase.\n\nIn its year-ahead economic outlook, BofA said it believes growth will remain strong and inflation will stay above target next year, pointing to tailwinds such as the Fed's rate cuts, AI investment, more supportive trade policy, and stimulus in President Donald Trump's Big Beautiful Bill.\n\n\"Tariff cuts, tax cuts, rate cuts…'run-it-hot' US policy, implicit guarantee economy & stocks 'too big to fail,'\" a team of analysts led by Michael Hartnett wrote in a separate client note this fall.\n\nMorgan Stanley strategists also unveiled their \"run it hot\" investment thesis heading into 2026, pointing to the Fed's rate-cutting cycle and the central bank's recent announcement that it would begin reserve management purchases.\n\nGoldman Sachs said it also saw economic growth remaining robust in 2026, thanks to the Fed cutting rates in a non-recessionary macro environment.\n\n\"Despite stagnant job growth, we expect policy rate cuts to limit labour market weakness and help extend the economic cycle further,\" Goldman said, though it noted that valuations in the stock market are already \"hot.\"\n\nHere's how the forecasters think investors should position themselves in a \"run it hot\" market.\n\nCommodities are the top run-it-hot trade heading into next year, Bank of America strategists wrote in a note in December.\n\nOil and energy are also favorable investments under the run-it-hot regime, they added.\n\n\"Trump runs it hot, oil bounces post Russia-Ukraine fix, China keeps yuan cheap, soon all the commodity charts will look like gold,\" strategists wrote. \"We say long commodities the best 'run it hot' trade in '26, and long despised oil/energy without question the best 'run-it-hot' contrarian trade.\"\n\nCyclical assets — which, by definition, tend to do well when the economy is expanding — are likely to benefit from the macro picture next year, Goldman Sachs said.\n\nThe bank pointed to areas like housing and consumer-facing sides of the market, which include consumer discretionary and retail stocks.\n\n\"After a patch of worry in November, cyclical assets—including cyclical equities and copper—have been rallying again. But even after these recent moves, we think our more optimistic growth views are not fully reflected in markets,\" the bank wrote.\n\nMorgan Stanley thinks consumer discretionary goods investments fall into the \"run it hot\" investing playbook. The bank noted that firms generally have higher pricing power today, which should boost revenue growth.\n\nThat dynamic is already playing out in the discretionary goods sector, strategists said. The rate for top-line earnings beats in the sector for the third quarter clocked in at 6%, above the 2% rate for the overall S&P 500, per Morgan Stanley's analysis.\n\nSmall-cap stocks also look attractive, with earnings and pricing power in the sector poised to accelerate heading into next year, Morgan Stanley added.\n\n\"On the earnings front, the two most important aspects of our constructive call are the return of (1) positive operating leverage and (2) pricing power. This combination is especially impactful for the small cap earnings recovery we foresee into 2026,\" the bank's strategists added.\n\nForecasters at Bank of America and Goldman Sachs have also issued bullish calls on small-cap stocks heading into 2026, largely because valuations in the sector are more attractive than in areas such as mega-cap tech stocks.",

    "title": "All 8 Blackstone holiday videos ranked",
    "description": "Blackstone's holiday video has become a cringe-inducing tradition on Wall Street for eight years. Here are the ones worth watching.",
    "fullText": "Blackstone released its 2025 holiday video on Thursday — the latest installment in a tradition that began in 2018 as a way to liven up employees' spirits in lieu of the holiday party, which was canceled because the firm had grown too large.\n\nSince then, the video has become a viral sensation. Eight million people viewed 2023's video showing Blackstone's executives fumbling in their efforts to be more like Taylor Swift — the same year the Daily Mail wondered whether it might be \"the most cringeworthy corporate video ever.\"\n\nWatching — and poking fun at — the video is now a Wall Street tradition, making Jay Gillespie, Blackstone's head of video, a hot commodity at 345 Park Avenue.\n\n\"People come up to me throughout the year, and they're like, 'My daughter is helping me rehearse so I might get a line next year,'\" Gillespie told Business Insider in 2024. \"People are really into lobbying to be in it.\"\n\nIf you don't get it, don't worry. We decided to help readers save time by watching and reviewing all of the firm's videos going back to 2018.\n\nThis video was released in December 2020, during the peak of the pandemic. It stuck to the theme it launched in 2018 of depicting Blackstone as a version of the NBC sitcom \"The Office,\" but executives wore face masks and pandemic jokes featured prominently. In an early scene, one Blackstone executive struggles to recognize a colleague with unmanageably long hair. (Remember when all the barber shops were closed?)\n\nWhile it was a bleak time, the video ends on an upbeat note, with Blackstone employees cutting loose to \"I'm Walking on Sunshine,\" kicking off a tradition of holiday video songs that has featured prominently since. Still, it's somewhat stuck in the pandemic era, hence its placement at No. 7.\n\nThe conceit of this holiday season is a fake news station, \"BX TV News,\" prompting Jon Gray to search for Blackstone's secret sauce. (It was a roundabout way for the firm to tout its plan to hit $1 trillion assets under management, which it has since achieved.)\n\nSchwarzman returns to a role he often plays in these videos, that of the sincere elder statesman, to explain that the firm's true secret sauce is its employees. However, he notes that a secret is hidden in the basement, setting two executives on an Indiana Jones-style quest to find the scroll containing the firm's secret. This weird twist is the highlight of the video.\n\nThe video effectively makes several self-deprecating jokes about Blackstone's love of acronyms (BCRED, anyone?) and Wall Street's notorious work hours. By 2022, however, the company had been going with \"The Office\" theme for four years, hence its ranking.\n\nThe budget for the holiday video clearly increased this year, with a storyline about the birth of BX TV, the firm's weekly video call that Gray is incredibly enthusiastic about (and employees, less so). There are animals, special effects, and a Reese Witherspoon cameo.\n\nThe key joke is a fake award ceremony where Gray receives \"Best Weekly Internal Zoom Call at an Alternative Asset Management firm.\" The hope is that it will convince the firm's president and chief operating officer that it's time to move on with John Finley, chief legal officer, saying, \"I make one call to the FCC, and they'll cancel this clown car.\"\n\nEmployees chant \"end it\" and celebrate, thinking Gray has decided to cancel the show after winning the award. It quickly becomes clear that the 2022 BX TV season is already being planned, and the internal video call remains a weekly requirement at the firm.\n\nScranton, Pennsylvania, is a long way from Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, and Dunder Mifflin would be among its smallest portfolio companies, yet Blackstone successfully riffed off the NBC sitcom \"The Office\" for its first annual holiday video. The video begins with the theme music from the television show, and like \"The Office,\" there is hand-held camera work and plenty of \"candid\" interviews with executives. There's also a Michael Scott look-alike. As with all the holiday videos that follow, this one starts with Jon Gray calling his executive assistant, Laurie Carlson.\n\nThis video started it all and set the tone for Blackstone's trademark style of mixing the firm's reality with jokes. The premise of the video is that Blackstone canceled its holiday party and replaced it with a video, which actually happened. And Jon Gray really does, sometimes, act a bit like Michael Scott in his enthusiasm for wild ideas, according to people who know him. There are fewer visual gags and no Hollywood cameos, but it's a classic.\n\n2023's holiday video marked the first time Blackstone moved away from being a parallel version of \"The Office\" (only the title card remains). Instead, it's an homage to Taylor Swift and the Eras tour, with Blackstone trying to replicate her success with its own song about alternative investments.\n\nThis is the video that broke into the wider world, spawning mocking tabloid headlines. But for a video series whose main goal is to help the firm laugh at itself, that's a measure of success. Add that this immortal line: \"Just this once, I do hope people confuse us with BlackRock.\" Also, you get to see Steve Schwarzman dancing while wearing a glittery fringe top.\n\nThis year, Blackstone turned 40 years old, so it was only right that the firm lived out its midlife crisis in front of all of us. The birthday celebration begins with a Ken Burns documentary about the firm's origins, before Jon Gray asks for Burns to be fired in favor of some \"pizzaz.\"\n\nBlackstone's execs are all dealing with their age in different ways: wearing nose rings and buying sports teams or Ferrari (the company). Steve Schwarzman's ambition to become a DJ leads to a cameo by actual DJ and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon.\n\nAnother cameo from Jersey Mike's spokesperson Danny DeVito is a highlight, with his contract apparently requiring him to take on the challenging job of advertising \"non-listed, semi-liquid, institutional-quality perpetual products.\"\n\nThe video ends with a musical number, this time an age-appropriate 80s theme, alongside a dizzying array of 80s references and an executive pulling off the iconic Dirty Dancing lift. After a challenging year for the firm's employees, this year the firm leaned into embarrassing itself and having fun.\n\nThe 2019 holiday video revolves around Blackstone's absurd search for a company mascot, which turns out to be Mr. Stone, a mascot that looks like a cross of Hulk and Jon Gray. The international offices of Blackstone get cameos in this one, as does a plug for Steve Schwarzman's book, \"What It Takes: Lessons in the Pursuit of Excellence.\"\n\nGray told BI that this was his favorite in the series because of the mascot. The firm not only hired a company to build the mascot suit, but also made dozens of bobbleheads, which still show up in holiday videos and on some people's desks.

    "fullText": "LONDON, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Major banks including JPMorgan, UBS and Citigroup on Thursday won their bid to block a 2.7 billion-pound ($3.6 billion) mass ​lawsuit over alleged foreign exchange rigging.\n\nPhillip Evans, a former inquiry chair at ‌Britain's Competition Markets Authority, was leading the case on behalf of thousands of asset managers, pension funds ‌and financial institutions.\n\nThe lawsuit, which was also brought against Barclays, MUFG and NatWest, was based on findings made by the European Commission, which fined banks more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in 2019.\n\nSome of the world's biggest investment banks have paid more than ⁠a combined $11 billion in fines ‌to settle U.S., British and European regulatory allegations that traders manipulated currency rates for years.\n\nEvans' case was initially blocked in 2022 ‍by the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), which refused to certify it on an opt-out basis, meaning members of the claimant class would be part of the case unless they decided otherwise.\n\nThe CAT said ​the case could be brought on an opt-in basis, though it accepted that ‌would effectively end the litigation.\n\nEvans' case was revived by the Court of Appeal in 2023, but the banks' appeal was upheld by the United Kingdom's Supreme Court on Thursday.\n\nJudge Vivien Rose said the Competition Appeal Tribunal \"was right to assess the merits of the claim as weak\".\n\nShe added that some members of the claimant class may ⁠have a viable claim, but they had shown ​no interest in pursuing it and represented \"a tiny ​fraction\" of the case's value.\n\nUBS and MUFG welcomed the ruling. JPMorgan and Barclays declined to comment. Citi and NatWest did not immediately ‍respond to a request ⁠for comment.\n\nEvans said in a statement that he would consider \"what options remain available to pursue justice for those affected\".\n\n\"The practical reality is that opt-in proceedings ⁠are unlikely to deliver meaningful redress for the tens of thousands of ordinary individuals and businesses ‌affected by the banks' unlawful conduct,\" he said.",

    "description": "Manhattan federal prosecutors have charged Tricolor execs Daniel Chu and David Goodgame of scheming to defraud banks and private credit lenders.",
    "fullText": "Founder Daniel Chu and the company's Chief Operating Officer David Goodgame, who were arrested and charged with bank fraud and wire fraud on Wednesday, planned to frighten at least one lender into a favorable deal, prosecutors allege. According to the indictment, the executives discussed telling a lender that the company might otherwise implode, much like the energy trading firm Enron in 2001, if a deal wasn't reached. This would be bad for the lender because it would put them at risk of losing everything.\n\n\"Enron obviously has a nice ring to it, right?\" Chu said when discussing with other Tricolor executives how to deal with one particular lender who had figured out the double-pledging issue.\n\n\"I mean, Enron, Enron raises the blood pressure of the lender when they see that. It, it has to, right?\" Chu said while laughing, documents show.\n\nIt's just one of several recorded conversations that emerged as part of a newly unsealed indictment against Chu and Goodgame. The indictment accused the men of orchestrating a years-long scheme to defraud banks and other private credit providers.\n\nChu is expected to be presented in a Florida court on Wednesday. Goodgame should be presented in a Texas court on Thursday. The men could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nTricolor rocked the banking industry when it filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September, leaving lenders like JPMorgan, Fifth Third Bank, and Jefferies exposed.\n\nAt the time of the company's September 10 bankruptcy, its largest lenders were owed more than $900 million \"as a result of the fraudulent double-pledging and collateral manipulation schemes\" orchestrated by Chu and supported by Goodgame, the feds said.\n\nBut that didn't stop Chu from using company money to enrich himself, according to prosecutors. They said Chu directed another executive to pay him the final installments of a $15 million bonus as the company approached bankruptcy, resulting in two payments from Tricolor totaling $6.25 million. Chu then used some of this money to purchase a multimillion-dollar property in Beverly Hills, California — weeks before Tricolor filed for Chapter 7, the feds said.\n\nThe back-to-back bankruptcies of Tricolor and auto parts company First Brands have raised questions about the health of the credit market, prompting JPMorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon to tell investors that he has his \"antenna\" up.\n\n\"When you see one cockroach, there's probably more,\" Dimon said on the bank's third-quarter earnings call with analysts.",

    "fullText": "Howard \"Howie\" Rubin, a once-prominent Salomon Brothers investment banker featured in the 1985 Wall Street expose \"Liar's Poker,\" must remain in a federal jail in Brooklyn indefinitely as he fights sex-trafficking charges, a judge ruled on Wednesday.\n\nIt was the third bail denial for Rubin, accused of paying women, many of them former Playboy models, $5,000 to engage in \"fetish play,\" then constraining and torturing them, including by electrocuting them against their will.\n\nMagistrate Judge Peggy Kuo said her main concern is the risk that the wealthy financier, who has a $70 million account based in the Cayman Islands, would flee the country.\n\n\"The thing that is troubling me is I don't know if I can trust Mr. Rubin,\" Kuo said in denying bail. She said she has no way of knowing for certain if Rubin is mulling, \"What does my life look like if I flee, and what does it look like if I stay?\"\n\nRubin's 10-count indictment alleges a series of attacks against 10 Jane Does between 2009 and 2019 in luxury hotels and a soundproofed bedroom \"sex dungeon\" at his Manhattan penthouse apartment.\n\nRubin, 70, of Fairfield, Connecticut, pleaded not guilty and has been held without bail since his arrest in September. Rubin was once considered one of Wall Street's most skilled and aggressive traders of complex mortgage securities, earning him roles at influential firms like Merrill Lynch and Soros Fund Management.\n\nIn his latest bid for freedom, his lawyers had offered a $70 million bond, co-signed by family members. They include his wife, who has been divorcing him since 2021, and who wrote a letter to the judge extolling his devotion to three young grandchildren, who call him \"Pops.\"\n\n\"There is no allegation that Mr. Rubin engaged in any BDSM activity since 2019,\" his lawyers wrote in bail arguments filed Tuesday. \"He has been living in Connecticut for years, devoted to the care of his grandchildren,\" they wrote.\n\nFederal prosecutors countered that no amount of bail or electronic monitoring could guarantee Rubin's return to court; they also say that he has used threats and coercion to silence his accusers, allegations Rubin denies.\n\nRubin's former personal assistant, Jennifer Powers, has been charged with pocketing millions of dollars to arrange the encounters; she has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking charges and is free on $850,000 bail.\n\nHer husband, Stephen Powers, is free on $250,000, according to court records. Both Powers have pleaded not guilty to bank and tax fraud in connection with the encounters.\n\nThree attorneys for Rubin did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. A Department of Justice spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nRubin is due back in court on January 15. If convicted of the top sex trafficking charge, he faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years and as much as life in prison.",

    "description": "JPMorgan's mid-cap chief explains how investment banking works beyond Wall Street, and why the middle market has become a billion-dollar opportunity.",
    "fullText": "JPMorgan took a bet to build an investment banking machine outside Wall Street, and it tapped John Richert to do it.\n\nUnder Richert's watch, the business that serves founder-run companies with deep ties to their local economies has grown from four people to nearly 300 bankers, collectively generating more than $1 billion annually. After completing their junior analyst years — most often in New York — bankers on his team can relocate to any of the 13 offices the group operates across the country.\n\nIt's a model that challenges the traditional idea of investment banking as a strictly New York endeavor. What's far less visible is what it looks like to build and run a franchise in places like Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago, or across the Southeast.\n\nMid-cap investment banking deals generally fall within the range of roughly $2 billion and below, with the group's sweet spot for deal transaction value of about $500 million to $1.5 billion. Under Richert, who serves as the team's head, coverage sectors have expanded to encompass industrials, consumer retail, healthcare, media and communications, and more.\n\nWall Street rivals have taken note. Goldman Sachs launched its Cross Markets Group in 2019 to target founder-led and mid-sized companies, and UBS stood up a middle-market effort during the pandemic, dispatching bankers to the same cities where its wealth managers operate. What's more, the pipeline between capital markets teams and wealth advisers is become more intertwined, creating lucrative referral opportunities as founders seek to invest the wealth created from major IB transactions.\n\nRichert spoke to Business Insider from his office in Atlanta about what it's like to build a national investment-banking operation far from New York — and why he's optimistic about where the middle market is headed in the coming year. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nHow are you feeling about the mid-cap M&A environment heading into next year?\n\nI think we're pretty optimistic on 2026. We have our highest backlog sell-sides that we've ever had.\n\nWe have a lot of private equity funds that need to return capital to their LPs. They need to sell assets. You have a lot of funds that aren't going to be able to raise another fund but have a bunch of portfolio companies that they're going to need to sell. You've got aging baby boomers and founder-owned businesses that children are not wanting to take over the business.\n\nWhy does being local matter so much in your business, and how does that shape the way your team is built across the country?\n\nA dinner, bumping into a CEO on a Saturday on the soccer field or at kids' events. Like being in the communities, commercial banking is a local business. You've got to be in front of your clients. I once had a CEO tell me, \"The reason we like having you local is we like bumping into you and seeing you in the community. When you come and visit us, you're just paying a visit. You're not flying in from New York.\"\n\nWe don't chase fees or transactions, we chase relationships. Over time, if you do that, when that client decides that he has a transaction he needs you to work on, you've built that relationship over months and years. Local matters in our opinion.\n\nWhat's the allure of working outside of New York, and how can bankers who do stay plugged in with clients?\n\nI do think that analysts and associates should start out in New York to be in the center and the nexus of where it's happening. But then when you're tired of Manhattan or tired of commuting in from the tri-state area, there's a lot of great places you can work.\n\nCome to New York or LA, the two big concentrations for us. Do your two years there, and then once you get promoted to associate, if you're from the Southeast or the Midwest or Texas or the West Coast, we have these offices you can go work in.\n\nTake us back to the beginning. How did JPMorgan's mid-cap banking group start, and why was it created?\n\nI was at Barclays when I got a call from Doug Petno, now our CEO of JPMorgan's corporate investment bank. The firm asked me to move to Atlanta when we started this business about 12 years ago. Doug's first question was: What's our investment banking market share? And it was a low single digits compared to high single digits for the overall investment bank at JPMorgan. His first question was, 'Why is that?'\n\nI'm originally from Tennessee, so they said, \"You're the southerner. Would you like to go to Atlanta?\" We started in New York, Dallas, Chicago, and Atlanta.\n\nWhat challenges did you face as you built the business from the ground up?\n\nWe needed to find the right mix of talent who were both highly skilled and, critically, excited to help build something new and enduring in the industry — and that isn't easy. Hiring is a full time job.\n\nWe looked for individuals who saw the opportunity to innovate and grow, and who were willing to take a leap of faith with us. This endeavor was and continues to be very entrepreneurial. We are here building something brand new within JPMorgan, which is incredibly exciting but also incredibly hard work.\n\nHow is AI changing the work your bankers do today and do you think it will change who gets into banking or affect the number of jobs?\n\nWe have an internal LLM that summarizes information and makes us smarter when we talk to clients. Tasks that used to take a day to do, you can now do in an hour using AI.\n\nBut we are not doing anywhere near as much as we should be. Drafting S-1s, drafting confidential information memoranda, drafting communications — all of that we should be using AI to create efficiencies for the analysts' and associates' work.\n\nAI will allow us to cover more clients, which requires more people. Nobody likes staying up all night writing an S1. But if you can do an S1 in six or seven hours by using AI and leave the office at 8, that's not eliminating people. It's just making it a better lifestyle business.\n\nWhat part of running this business keeps you up at night?\n\nMy focus is always on ensuring our team is set up for success and that we maintain our drive for excellence.\n\nThere are myriad macro factors causing uncertainty across the market, and we are of course monitoring them all closely. Our priority is to stay agile and proactive so we can continue delivering outstanding results for our clients, no matter the environment.\n\nHow would you describe your leadership style and the culture you've built?\n\nLead by example. There's nothing I would ask anybody on my team to do that I have not done or would not do myself.\n\nI tell everyone, 'This is just a job. Family comes first. Treat everyone you meet with respect.'\n\nI'm trying to make this team the best it can be. Everyone from the top to the bottom matters. The MDs can't be successful without the analyst, and the analyst can't be successful without the MDs. Culture is not transferred over Zoom.\n\nIt's pretty easy. Just go give good advice to your clients. The rest of it will work out.",

    "fullText": "It’s been three years since OpenAI set off euphoria over artificial intelligence with the release of ChatGPT. And while the money is still pouring in, so are the doubts about whether the good times can last.\n\nA recent sell-off in the shares of Nvidia Corp., Oracle Corp.’s plunge after reporting mounting spending on AI, souring sentiment around a network of companies exposed to OpenAI — signs of skepticism are increasing. Looking to 2026, the debate among investors is whether to rein in AI exposure ahead of a potential bubble popping or double down to capitalize on the game-changing technology.\n\n“We’re in the phase of the cycle where the rubber meets the road,” said Jim Morrow, chief executive of Callodine Capital Management. “It’s been a good story, but we’re sort of anteing up at this point to see whether the returns on investment are going to be good.”\n\nThe queasiness about the AI trade involves its uses, the enormous cost of developing it, and whether consumers ultimately will pay for the services. Those answers will have major implications for the stock market’s future.\n\nThe Standard & Poor’s 500 index’s three-year, $30-trillion bull run has largely been driven by the world’s biggest tech companies such as Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp., as well as firms benefiting from spending on AI infrastructure such as chipmakers Nvidia and Broadcom Inc. and electricity providers such as Constellation Energy Corp. If they stop rising, the equities indexes will follow.\n\n“These stocks don’t correct because the growth rate goes down,” said Sameer Bhasin, principal at Value Point Capital. “These stocks correct when the growth rate doesn’t accelerate any further.”\n\nOf course, there are still plenty of reasons for optimism. The tech giants that account for much of the AI spending have vast resources and have pledged to keep pumping in cash in the years ahead. Plus, developers of AI services, such as Alphabet’s Google, continue to make strides with new models. Hence the debate.\n\nHere’s a look at the key trends to watch while navigating through these choppy waters.\n\nOpenAI alone plans to spend $1.4 trillion in the coming years. But the Sam Altman-led company, which became the world’s most valuable startup in October, is generating far less revenue than its operating costs. It expects to burn $115 billion through 2029 before generating cash in 2030, the Information reported in September.\n\nThe company has had no problem with fundraising, collecting $40 billion from Softbank Group Corp. and other investors earlier this year. Nvidia pledged to invest as much as $100 billion in September, one of a series of deals the chipmaker has made that funnel cash to its customers, which is causing fears of circular financing in the AI industry.\n\nOpenAI could run into trouble if investors start to balk at committing more capital. And the consequences would spiral to the companies in its orbit, such as computing services provider CoreWeave Inc.\n\n“If you think about how much money — it’s in the trillions now — is crowded into a small group of themes and names, when there’s the first hint of that theme even having short-term issues or just valuations get so stretched they can’t possibly continue to grow like that, they’re all leaving at once,” said Eric Clark, portfolio manager at the Rational Dynamic Brands Fund.\n\nPlenty of other companies are reliant on external funding to pursue AI ambitions. Oracle shares soared as it racked up bookings for cloud computing services, but building those data centers will require massive amounts of cash, which the company has secured by selling tens of billions of dollars in bonds. Using debt puts pressure on a company because bondholders need to be paid in cash on a schedule, unlike equity investors, who mostly profit as share prices rise.\n\nOracle’s stock got pounded on Thursday after the company reported significantly higher capital expenditures than expected in its fiscal second quarter and cloud sales growth missed the average analyst estimate. On Friday, a report that some data center projects it’s developing for OpenAI have been delayed sent Oracle’s shares down further and weighed on other stocks exposed to AI infrastructure. Meanwhile, a gauge of Oracle’s credit risk hit the highest level since 2009.\n\nAn Oracle spokesperson said in a statement that the company remained confident in its ability to meet its obligations and future expansion plans.\n\n“The credit people are smarter than the equity people, or at least they’re worried about the right thing — getting their money back,” said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.\n\nAlphabet, Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are projected to spend more than $400 billion on capital expenditures in the next 12 months, most of it for data centers. Although those companies are seeing AI-related revenue growth from cloud-computing and advertising businesses, it’s nowhere near the costs they’re incurring.\n\n“Any plateauing of growth projections or decelerations, we’re going to wind up in a situation where the market says, ‘OK, there’s an issue here,’” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading.\n\nEarnings growth for the Magnificent Seven tech giants, which also includes Apple Inc., Nvidia and Tesla Inc., is projected to be 18% in 2026, the slowest in four years and slightly better than the S&P 500, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nRising depreciation expenses from the data center binge is a major worry. Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta combined for about $10 billion in depreciation costs in the final quarter of 2023. The figure rose to nearly $22 billion in the quarter that just ended in September. And it’s expected to be about $30 billion by this time next year.\n\nAll of this could put pressure on buybacks and dividends, which return cash to stockholders. In 2026, Meta and Microsoft are expected to have negative free cash flow after accounting for shareholder returns, while Alphabet is seen roughly breaking even, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nPerhaps the biggest concern about all the spending is the strategy shift it represents. Big Tech’s value has long been premised on the companies’ ability to generate rapid revenue growth at low costs, which resulted in immense free cash flows. But their plans for AI have turned that upside down.\n\n“If we continue down the track of lever up our company to build out for the hopes that we can monetize this, multiples are going to contract,” O’Rourke said. “If things don’t come together for you, this whole pivot would have been a drastic mistake.”\n\nWhile Big Tech’s valuations are high, they’re nowhere near excessive compared with past periods of market euphoria. Comparisons with the dot-com bust are common, but the magnitude of the gains from AI are nothing like what happened during the development of the internet. For example, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index is priced at 26 times projected profits, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That figure exceeded 80 times at the height of the dot-com bubble.\n\nValuations during the dot-com era were far in excess of where they are now partly because of how far the stocks had run, but also because the companies were younger and less profitable — if they had profits at all.\n\n“These aren’t dot-com multiples,” said Tony DeSpirito, global chief investment officer and portfolio manager of fundamental equities at BlackRock. “This isn’t to say there aren’t pockets of speculation or irrational exuberance, because there are, but I don’t think that exuberance is in the AI-related names of the Mag 7.”\n\nPalantir Technologies Inc., which trades at a multiple of more than 180 times estimated profits, is among the AI stocks with nosebleed valuations. Snowflake Inc. is another, with a multiple of almost 140 times projected earnings. But Nvidia, Alphabet and Microsoft are all below 30 times, which is relatively tame considering all the euphoria surrounding them.\n\nAll of which leaves investors in a quandary. Yes, the risks are right on the surface even as investors keep pouring into AI stocks. But for now, most companies aren’t priced at panic-inducing levels. The question is which direction the AI trade goes from here.\n\n“This kind of group thinking is going to crack,” Value Point’s Bhasin said. “It probably won’t crash like it did in 2000. But we’ll see a rotation.”\n\nWittenstein writes for Bloomberg.",

    "description": "The Jeffrey Epstein victims'  lawsuits resembled two others, against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, which settled for hundreds of millions.",
    "fullText": "A federal judge expressed skepticism about a pair of lawsuits that victims of Jeffrey Epstein had filed against two banks, suggesting he may dismiss them before they have a chance to go to trial.\n\nAt the outset of a Monday afternoon hearing in Manhattan federal court, US District Judge Jed Rakoff unfavorably compared the lawsuits against Bank of America and BNY Mellon to two similar lawsuits he had previously overseen, against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank. JPMorgan agreed to settle the case for $290 million. Deutsche Bank agreed to settle for $75 million.\n\nRakoff said the language in the lawsuits against Bank of America and BNY Mellon — which were brought by the same attorneys and filed in October — was \"frequently conclusory\" and appeared to lack sufficient detail to demonstrate what the banks did wrong. He called the lawsuits \"a model of high-pitched rhetoric.\"\n\n\"'Knows' without saying by whom is vague. 'Affiliated' without saying what that means is vague,\" Rakoff told David Boies, an attorney who brought the case. \"A lot of that language is in the complaint.\"\n\nAt the end of the hearing, Rakoff gave the lawyers who brought the lawsuits on behalf of Epstein victims — David Boies, Sigrid McCawley, Brad Edwards, and Brittany Henderson — two weeks to revise their cases with more specific details about their allegations.\n\nThe judge said they would be permitted to use material they had already gathered as part of the discovery process in the case, but should put a hold on additional depositions and subpoenas until he issued a ruling, which he said could come at the end of January.\n\nThe lawsuits allege that Bank of America and BNY Mellon aided in Epstein's sex-trafficking operation by providing him with banking services and then ignoring red flags tied to his transactions.\n\nEpstein, a well-connected financier, killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on criminal sex-trafficking charges. One of his associates, Ghislaine Maxwell, is serving a 20-year prison sentence for trafficking girls to him.\n\nMonday's hearing was scheduled for the judge to weigh motions to dismiss the two lawsuits outright.\n\nCharlotte Taylor, an attorney at the law firm Jones Day representing Bank of America, argued the lawsuits consisted of \"recycled boilerplate allegations\" and that they could not prove the bank provided anything other than \"routine banking services\" to Epstein and his associates. Felicia Ellsworth, an attorney at WilmerHale, said the plaintiffs couldn't prove anyone at BNY Mellon had the \"state of mind\" to be found liable.\n\nBoies told Rakoff that the banks should have noticed enough smoke around the transactions from bank accounts belonging to Epstein and his associates to know there was a fire. Aside from Epstein's 2008 criminal conviction in Florida, he had been dogged by civil litigation for years, Boies said.\n\nRakoff expressed skepticism that the pattern of facts alleged in the lawsuit would be enough.\n\n\"Last I checked, that's not enough to survive a motion to dismiss,\" Rakoff said. \"You need to have enough allegations as to specific facts.\"\n\nFollowing the hearing, lawyers for the Epstein victims appeared eager to revise their lawsuits and include the information they obtained through the discovery process. Rakoff said that material may be redacted on the public docket.\n\n\"I think he's giving us a chance,\" Sigrid McCawley, an attorney at Boies Schiller Flexner, told Business Insider.",
