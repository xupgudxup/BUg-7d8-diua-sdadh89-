    "fullText": "World Liberty Financial, the crypto firm cofounded and partly run by the Trump family, will tokenize loan revenue interest from a new Trump International Hotel and Resort in the Maldives.\n\nTokenization is the process of putting an asset on the blockchain to turn it into a crypto token that can be easily traded, in this case, a loan used to fund the construction of a hotel. Investors who buy tokenized pieces of the loan will be entitled to a portion of the interest payments made on it.\n\nAccording to WLF documents, DT Marks DEFI LLC, which is owned by the Trump family, reserves the right to receive 75% of the revenue generated from $WFLI token sales after expenses.\n\nThe offering won't be available to everyone. Only accredited investors, or those with at least $1 million in liquid assets and who make enough money per year, will be given access to the tokenized loan. The tokens will be offered in partnership with Securitize, Inc. and Dar Global PLC.\n\nThe Trump hotel in the Maldives is set to open in 2030 and was announced in late 2025.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is listed as \"Cofounder Emeritus\" of World Liberty Financial on its website. His three sons — Don Jr., Eric, and Baron — are listed as cofounders, as is Steve Witkoff, who is currently serving as United States special envoy to the Middle East.\n\nWorld Liberty Financial's new tokenization offering is the Trump family's latest move in the crypto space. In January 2025, Trump launched $Trump coin, a meme token that spiked to $45 shortly after launch, and currently trades at $3.40. According to Reuters, the coin made almost $100 million in fees in the first couple weeks after its launch.\n\nWLF also sold a 49% stake in January 2025 to an Emirati royal for $500 million, the Wall Street Journal reported. The firm launched a stablecoin, USD1, last March.\n\nIn addition, Trump Media and Technology Group adopted a crypto treasury strategy last year, buying billions of dollars in bitcoin. According to a Bloomberg report, crypto had boosted the Trump family's net worth by $1.4 billion as of January 2026.\n\nThe token offering from WLF comes as crypto assets endure a brutal bear market as funds flee the space. Bitcoin's price is down 45% from October's high, while ethereum has fallen 59% since August.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Death and taxes may be inevitable. A big bill for your heirs is not.\n\nThe rich have made an art of avoiding taxes and making sure their wealth passes down effortlessly to the next generation. But the tricks they use – to expedite payouts to heirs and avoid handing money to the government – can also work for people with far more modest estates.\n\nWhat estate planning strategies do wealthy families use?\n\nWhat is the step-up rule for inherited stocks?\n\nHow can trusts help non-wealthy families avoid probate?\n\nHow do beneficiary designations simplify asset transfers?\n\n“It’s a strategic game of chess played over decades,” says Mark Bosler, an estate planning attorney in Troy, Michigan, and legal adviser to Real Estate Bees. “While the average person relies on a simple will, the well-to-do utilize a different playbook.”\n\nFirst, consider the facts: Despite widespread misconceptions, only estates of the very richest Americans are generally subject to taxes. At the federal level, estates of over $15 million typically trigger taxes. At the state level, 16 states and the District of Columbia do collect estate or inheritance taxes, according to the Tax Foundation, sometimes with lower exemptions than the IRS, but still at thresholds targeting millionaires.\n\nWhile most people can pass on what they have without worrying about their heirs being caught in a web of taxes, it can require planning to escape a messy process that can hold up estates for years and cost families significantly in court fees and lawyer bills.\n\nThe solution at the center of many estate planners’ designs is a trust.\n\nThough trusts conjure images of complex arrangements utilized by the uber-rich, they are relatively simple tools that can make sense for many people. They come with expense, often costing thousands of dollars in lawyer fees to set them up. But for a retired couple with a paid-off house, 401(k)s and a portfolio of investments, they can ease the passing of assets to heirs.\n\nAmong the reasons: Even if you aren’t leaving enough behind to trigger taxes, your estate can get tied up in probate court, which typically assesses fees based on an estate's total value.\n\n“You are leaving what might have gone to your children or other loved ones to attorneys and the courts,” says Renee Fry, CEO of Gentreo, an online estate planner based in Quincy, Massachusetts. “Anywhere from 3 to 8% of an estate might be lost.”\n\nTrusts can allow an estate to sidestep court altogether and to shield it from public view by keeping details out of public records. Some people also use them to protect their savings if they someday need nursing home care and would prefer to qualify for a government-paid stay under Medicaid instead of paying themselves.\n\nImagine being an investor in a stock like Nvidia that has soared in recent years. Now imagine being able to reap the profit of selling your shares without paying tax.",

    "description": "Billionaire real estate mogul Mortimer Zuckerman's personal expenses are laid out in exacting detail in the Epstein files.",
    "fullText": "Buried deep in the millions of pages known as the Epstein files, one document offers a rare glimpse into how the 0.0001% live: a list of billionaire Mortimer Zuckerman's personal expenses for a year.\n\nThink of it as a financial diary from the uppermost stratosphere of wealth, where the ordinary rules of budgeting simply don't apply.\n\nTucked at the bottom of a portfolio performance report conducted by financial advisors at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, the accounting tracks Zuckerman's spending from 2011. It includes the everyday and inexpensive, like $140 in parking tickets, to the extravagant, a $220,000 outlay to buy and keep horses.\n\nZuckerman, who is worth $2.8 billion, according to Forbes, made his money in real estate investing; he now owns and serves as the editor in chief of US News & World Report. He's donated hundreds of millions to various causes, including six-figure sums to fund neuroscience research at Columbia University and cancer research at Memorial Sloan Kettering.\n\nAt the time of the portfolio report, he owned properties in East Hampton, Manhattan, and Aspen, as well as a yacht named the Lazy Z, a Lexus, a Mercedes, and at least one private plane.\n\nHe and Epstein worked together in the past, financing the pop culture magazine Radar in the early 2000s. The newly released Epstein files suggest other ties: They include a draft agreement in which Zuckerman would pay Epstein's Southern Trust $20 million for estate planning services in 2013. Zuckerman also appeared in a book of messages put together for Epstein's 50th birthday, released by the House Oversight Committee last year.\n\nZucker and representatives for Zuckerman-cofounded Boston Properties and US News & World Report did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Morgan Stanley report provides a fascinating snapshot of how the wealthy live — and spend — from detailed bills for commonplace expenses like clothes, home repairs, and childcare, to tallies for parties, wine, and fine art. Zuckerman's personal expenses for 2011 totaled $8.9 million, or roughly $12.8 million in today's dollars.\n\nZuckerman's federal tax bill topped $1 million. The real estate taxes on one of his oceanfront East Hampton homes, which was valued at $30.5 million at the time, came to $156,818.\n\nThe report details improvements and repairs across Zuckerman's properties, including a mold fix in East Hampton ($1,401) and a $223,769 payment for one month's repairs on his Fifth Avenue apartment, a 6,500-square-foot triplex overlooking Central Park.\n\nZuckerman paid more than $1 million for personal staff throughout the year.\n\nThe maintenance fee for Zuckerman's Fifth Avenue co-op totaled $261,187 for the year. He also rented an apartment about 10 blocks south of his primary residence for part of the year ($448,000), as well as a space in Manhattan's Kips Bay for four months ($18,232).\n\nRunning his various properties was not cheap. The landscaping bill for the year totaled $127,089 — nearly all for work at his East Hampton properties — and he also shelled out on furniture ($192,692), housekeeping ($39,322), security ($12,313), and pool work ($9,979). Groceries cost $113,946, not including wine, which had a separate $4,958 tab.\n\nZuckerman's charitable giving totaled $413,293 in 2011. At the time, his charitable trust was worth $167 million.\n\nThe breakdown includes travel for him and his family, his staff ($2,148), and the cost of his helicopter use ($5,458). There was no line item marked for his private plane.\n\nZuckerman's personal expenses ranged from clothing ($67,184 for himself, plus thousands more for his daughters) to medical ($72,526 for himself). School tuition ($59,621), camp ($5,145), and other activities, like ballet and piano, for his daughters totalled $82,128. Within clothing, cleaning was its own line item: $2,318.\n\nHorses made up the bulk of Zuckerman's recreational spending, totaling $219,074, including the cost of housing ($96,031), medical care ($37,577), and lessons ($5,564). Skiing ($50,777) and tennis ($7,717) were among other costly hobbies. His party bill totaled $22,526.\n\nMoving and storage costs were split between each of Zuckerman's properties, as well as a fee ($140,809) for his art.\n\nZuckerman paid for nearly a dozen insurance policies, including homeowners ($91,406), fine art ($86,380), and auto ($5,863).\n\nThe art bill included costs for repairs ($73,817), framing ($15,823), and conservation ($31,542), as well as moving, documentation, and appraisals.\n\nThis category includes various fees, subscriptions, loans, and bank charges, as well as petty cash. Zuckerman's Fifth Avenue and East Hampton homes each got a stash ($56,245), as did he ($15,000) and his nanny ($22,088.82).",

    "description": "A cost seg study can cost several thousand dollars, but it can also maximize ROI on a property.",
    "fullText": "Owning rental property comes with significant tax advantages. So significant that, when used strategically, they can help investors scale solely through tax savings.\n\nJill Green, a full-time physician who invests in real estate with her husband on the side, has used tax savings to grow her portfolio by roughly one property per year.\n\nOne of the strategies behind her growth: cost segregation studies, which allow her and other real estate investors to accelerate depreciation.\n\nRental property owners can deduct a wide range of expenses, including mortgage interest and insurance, as well as travel and equipment costs, thereby significantly reducing their taxable income.\n\nOne of the most powerful deductions is depreciation.\n\nDepreciation allows investors to deduct the cost of a building over its IRS-defined useful life: 27.5 years for residential properties and 39 years for commercial properties. To calculate annual depreciation, owners divide the building's value (excluding land) by the applicable timeline.\n\nFor example, if you buy a $1 million commercial building, standard depreciation allows you to deduct 1/39 of its value each year.\n\nA cost segregation study changes that math.\n\nA cost segregation study, often called a \"cost seg,\" accelerates depreciation by separating a building into components that can be depreciated more quickly than the building as a whole.\n\nEngineers analyze the property's internal and external elements — such as flooring, electrical systems, plumbing, and HVAC — and reclassify certain portions into shorter depreciation categories of five, seven, or 15 years. They may determine that an electrical outlet is not expected to last 39 years, for example, and, instead, is a three-year asset.\n\nSo, instead of depreciating the entire $1 million building over 39 years, portions of it may qualify for faster write-offs. That acceleration can dramatically increase first-year deductions.\n\nUsing the same $1 million example: rather than deducting about $25,600 in year one (1/39 of $1 million), an investor could potentially deduct hundreds of thousands of dollars upfront through accelerated and bonus depreciation.\n\nClaiming larger deductions early in ownership reduces tax liability and increases available cash.\n\n\"You can take a big chunk in those first couple of years and basically put yourself into a loss position because the deduction is so large,\" CPA Kristel Espinosa told Business Insider. \"If you don't need all of the loss in the current year, that loss carries over into subsequent years, so those losses could shelter the rental income from this property for years to come.\"\n\nNote that, in most cases, depreciation can offset passive income — such as rental income — but not active income like W-2 wages. However, investors who qualify as real estate professionals under IRS rules can use rental losses to offset active income. Green's spouse qualifies for real estate professional status, or REPS, which makes their cost segregation studies especially powerful: the accelerated depreciation deductions can offset active income, delivering significant and immediate tax savings that wouldn't otherwise be available.\n\nA cost seg study typically costs several thousand dollars and can take one to two months to complete. Whether it makes sense depends on the property's size, purchase price, and the investor's tax situation.\n\nEspinosa said the strategy often works best for higher-income investors who own commercial properties or large portfolios.\n\nAs a general rule, \"a cost segregation study typically allows 20% to 40% of a building's cost to be reclassified into shorter depreciation periods,\" she said. \"This can generate first-year tax savings of $50,000 to $150,000+ per $1 million in building cost, depending on the study results and your tax situation.\"\n\nShe gave the example of a $15 million commercial building. If $5 million is reclassified into shorter-life assets and qualifies for bonus depreciation, that could generate $3 million in deductions. At a 37% federal tax rate, that's roughly $1.11 million in federal tax savings, before accounting for state taxes.\n\nIn one case, Espinosa said a client saved about $1.8 million in taxes after paying roughly $10,000 for the study. That wasn't an extreme case for her client base, which includes high-income earners in top tax brackets who typically own large portfolios and commercial buildings, she said.\n\nStill, cost seg studies don't make sense for every property. They're generally more valuable for commercial buildings, which have more components to reclassify, and for higher purchase prices.\n\nGreen said she consults her CPA before ordering a study. When she bought a $123,000 property, it didn't make financial sense, especially since she planned to sell it quickly.\n\nEspinosa advises investors to work closely with experienced CPAs and cost segregation specialists and to retain detailed engineering reports in case of an audit.\n\n\"Cost segregation is powerful,\" she said, \"but it requires careful execution.\"",

It started with software last week, with the most dramatic repricing in the space in nearly 30 years, erasing $2 trillion in market cap.\n\nIn a development seemingly out of left field on Thursday, a company that used to make karaoke machines sent trucking stocks tumbling after it published a paper boasting its AI technology could improve shipping logistics.\n\nMarkets have been aware of AI risks, but fear of how the technology could disrupt the business world appears to be reaching a fever pitch amid a constant barrage of updates and new tools.\n\nMajor indexes wavered on Friday after a cooler-than-expected inflation report, on track for another losing week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was on track to end the week 1% lower.\n\nHere's where AI panic is being felt in the stock market.\n\nA historic sell-off in software kicked off the market's weeklong AI freakout.

    "title": "Zillow just dealt a big blow to Compass — but it may be too little too late",
    "description": "The home-search giant can continue banning some real estate listings from its site, a judge ruled. Homebuyers still face a messy search process.",
    "fullText": "Search for a home on Compass.com, the website of America's largest real estate brokerage, and you'll find a familiar layout: a map of available homes, a bunch of price tags, a lineup of shimmering kitchens and golden-hour facades. It all looks a lot like Zillow, the near-ubiquitous home search site.\n\nThere is one key difference between Compass' site and Zillow, though: a prominently displayed black box.\n\nBehind the black box sits a heap of listings beyond Zillow's reach, so-called \"Private Exclusives\" that can only be seen with the help of a Compass agent. The intrigue is undeniable: \"Unlock 347 (8%) more homes you won't find anywhere else,\" the box urges when I search in the Austin area. In Los Angeles, there are apparently 366 homes that can only be unearthed by contacting Compass. New York City boasts nearly 450 homes you can't find on Zillow, Realtor.com, or any other home-search portal.\n\nEach of these homes is technically in violation of Zillow's hotly debated \"Listing Access Standards,\" rules the search giant unveiled last April to crack down on agents — many of them at Compass — sharing homes in some places but not others. The country's most popular home-search portal has gone so far as to ban some listings from its vaunted website, which Zillow says is necessary to stem the rising tide of exclusive listings and preserve a fair and open marketplace: \"If a listing is online, it should be online everywhere,\" begins one of the company's blog posts.\n\nThe ban prompted a swift legal response from Compass, which sued Zillow in federal court, claiming the search site was using its monopoly power to quash competition. Compass may not want its listings on Zillow right away, but it does want them there eventually: CEO Robert Reffkin has likened the \"private exclusive\" phase to a movie trailer that drums up hype before a wider release. If Zillow bans listings, that wide release loses its luster.\n\nOn Friday, Zillow scored an early victory in the legal battle: A judge denied Compass's request for a preliminary injunction, which would have forced Zillow to stop enforcing its new rules. Compass' lawyers failed to show that Zillow is actually a monopoly, the judge concluded, so the so-called \"Zillow Ban\" lives — for now.\n\nThe judge's ruling is a big step in the real estate listing war, but the future of home search still looks murky.\n\nFor one thing, it's not even clear that Zillow really wants to enforce its own rules. Under the company's Listing Access Standards, agents who market a home publicly — posting a sign in the front yard, advertising the listing on their brokerage's website, or merely teasing its existence via Compass' black box — have one business day to share the home with everyone or risk having it blacklisted from Zillow. During the injunction hearing, though, the company revealed that it had sent about 1,200 warnings and banned just 50 homes from its site over a roughly four-month period last year. Internal documents also showed executives fretting over the risks of turning away agents and their listings. It's not a great look for the biggest name in home search to openly admit that it can't — or won't — show you every home for sale. Zillow may keep up its tepid enforcement of the ban, and it may very well deter some agents, especially those reliant on Zillow's reach, from following Compass' lead. But it won't stop these \"exclusive listings\" from proliferating.\n\n\"Zillow's not going to go out and ban thousands of listings,\" says Mike DelPrete, a tech strategist and scholar-in-residence at the University of Colorado Boulder. \"They'd be shooting themselves in the foot.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Compass just keeps getting more powerful. Since the courtroom proceedings in November, the company has sidestepped regulatory scrutiny (thanks to some savvy politicking) to close on its acquisition of the second-largest brokerage in the US, Anywhere Real Estate, which owns household names like Corcoran, Century 21, and Coldwell Banker, among others. The combined company, including franchisees, would account for almost a quarter of nationwide home sales volume based on last year's figures, according to an analysis by T3 Sixty, a real estate management consulting firm. More agents mean more listings, which makes Compass' stockpile of exclusive homes all the more valuable. If Compass continues to advertise listings only on its own platforms — in internal databases or simply on the public-facing side of its website — it could attract even more agents and clients by promising them an edge in home search. \"Come here,\" the pitch goes, \"and you'll get access to a VIP room filled with the area's hottest listings.\" As one longtime real estate executive told me last year, \"Listings are fuel.\"\n\nThe legal setback doesn't amount to a total loss for Compass. Its antitrust case against Zillow will continue to wind its way through the courts, and the company could still prevail in a jury trial. Or Compass could simply decide to pursue its vision regardless of the courtroom result. \"We'll never give up,\" Reffkin, Compass' CEO, told me at company headquarters late last year, when I pressed him on the possibility that the legal battle doesn't go his way. Even if Zillow blocks some listings from its platform, Compass may plow ahead under the assumption that buyers and their agents will gravitate toward any place that offers them a leg up in their home search. And while Zillow may come out on top in the courtroom, the underlying state of play probably won't change. Compass still maintains thousands of home listings that are unavailable on other search portals. Other big brokerages are following suit, building up their own stockpiles of exclusive inventory in preparation for a world in which listings are more closely guarded rather than shared broadly from the get-go.\n\nIf you're looking to buy a house, this reality could make choosing an agent all the more fraught. Not only will you have to gauge their grasp on the local market or their negotiating chops, but you'll also have to consider how many listings you could gain early access to by choosing their brokerage. Some agents have always been able to unlock more inventory than others, via \"private listing networks\" or chummy relationships with potential sellers in the area. But if brokerages encourage more of their agents to share homes internally before making their broader debut, bigger companies like Compass could gain a decisive advantage, particularly in markets where they control a significant share of listings. This shift could make it more difficult to shrug off an agent and go it alone, or weaken your negotiating position if you want to bargain down your agent's fees. It also raises the real possibility of house-hunting FOMO: Even if the vast majority of these listings are eventually shared everywhere, you may have already missed the chance to be first in line for your dream home.\n\nFor now, these are still mostly hypothetical — the judge's ruling on a Friday morning didn't alter the status quo. It did, however, offer a preview of the messiness to come: more legal barbs, more blog posts, and, most importantly, more listings squirreled away in private databases or posted beyond Zillow's reach. Homebuyers, take note: The old way of searching for homes is fading fast.\n\nJames Rodriguez is a correspondent on Business Insider's Discourse team.",

    "description": "Former high-end real estate brokers Tal and Oren, plus Oren's twin, Alon Alexander, face up to life behind bars if convicted.",
    "fullText": "Former top ultra-luxury real estate broker brothers Oren and Tal Alexander, along with a third sibling, are sexual predators who together raped dozens of women and girls and then \"celebrated their crimes,\" a federal prosecutor told jurors on Tuesday.\n\nOver more than a decade, Tal, Oren, and Oren's twin, Alon Alexander, \"used whatever means necessary\" — including drugging victims and using \"brute force\" — to carry out the attacks, Assistant US Attorney Madison Reddick Smyser said in her opening statement at the brothers' Manhattan sex-trafficking trial.\n\nThe Alexander brothers face a dozen felony counts, including conspiracy to commit sex trafficking, sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion, and the sexual exploitation of a minor. They have vehemently denied the sex crimes charges against them, as well as all other allegations.\n\nIf convicted at trial, Tal Alexander, 39, and the twins, 38, could face up to life behind bars. It would mark a dramatic fall for the real estate agent brothers who built their careers on high-end luxury deals with notable clients, including Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, financier Leon Black, and Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.\n\nSmyser told the six-man, six-woman jury on Tuesday, that the Alexanders used \"power, wealth, and access to lure women and girls to them\" at swanky locales like the Hamptons, Miami, and Manhattan.\n\n\"They physically held victims down\" and put drugs like GHB and Xanax in their drinks, getting the women so intoxicated that, in one instance, their victim could not stand up, Smyser said.\n\n\"You'll hear from a woman who Tal held down, while Alon and two others raped that woman,\" said Smyser said, adding that the woman was 16 years old at the time.\n\n\"You will also learn that the defendants celebrated their crimes,\" said the prosecutor. \"For example, after Oren and Alon sexually assaulted three high school girls in a hotel room, Oren texted a friend that he took down a 17-year-old.\"\n\nThe brothers told each other in text messages that \"the only thing that could bring them down is if some 'hoe' complained,\" Smyser told the jurors.\n\nAn accuser using the pseudonym \"Katie Moore,\" was the first government witness to testify on Tuesday. She broke down in tears as she told the jury she was drugged and raped by Alon Alexander in 2012 when she was 20 years old.\n\nMoore said that she woke up naked with Alon Alexander standing over her, also naked, at the Manhattan apartment he shared with Tal Alexander, in the hours after an NBA Finals viewing party at the nearby penthouse of actor Zac Efron.\n\nShe described screaming \"no\" as she said she was assaulted.\n\nDefense attorneys for the brothers painted a starkly different portrayal of the sibling trio for the jury, saying that the Alexanders led a party-fueled lifestyle that involved lots and lots of consensual sex.\n\nThe brothers may be \"arrogant\" \"womanizers,\" but they are no sex traffickers, the lawyers said in their remarks, alleging that the accusers in the case are out for money.\n\n\"This case is about shame, opportunity, and money,\" Oren Alexander's attorney, Teny Geragos — who represented Sean \"Diddy\" Combs at his sex-trafficking trial last year — said in her opening statement.\n\nThe Alexanders, each wearing a suit jacket with a white dress shirt, listened intently while lawyers for Oren and Tal Alexander delivered separate opening statements, sometimes leaning forward in their seats at the defense table.\n\nGeragos described the Alexanders as successful and ambitious \"single men who liked to pursue women, at nightclubs, at bars, at restaurants, on apps — in other words, everywhere that single men in their 20s and 30s pursued women.\"\n\nThe women were attracted to the brothers and their lifestyle, and the brothers engaged in consensual sex with women who typically and amicably stayed in touch with them, she said.\n\nOren and Tal Alexander began their real estate careers at Douglas Elliman before launching their own brokerage, Official, in 2022. Alon Alexander was an executive at his family's private security firm.\n\n\"Remember, two things can be true at the same time,\" Gergaos told the jury. \"You may not approve of his lifestyle, but you can still find him not guilty of sex trafficking.\"\n\nGergaos argued that the Alexanders' accusers took drugs voluntarily and that no toxicology reports back up their accounts.\n\n\"Many of the accusers were ashamed after they had a one-night stand with one or more of the brothers,\" she said.\n\nTal Alexander's defense attorney, Deanna Paul, told the jury that the brothers were \"party boys\" and \"womanizers\" in their early 20s — but that this is not a crime.\n\n\"They slept with many, many women,\" Paul said, adding that the way the siblings talked about their sexual encounters was \"crude\" and \"arrogant,\" but it wasn't sex trafficking.\n\nThere was no \"commercial sex operation\" and no evidence that anyone was drugged involuntarily, Paul said. \"There are no contemporaneous reports to law enforcement,\" she added.\n\nThe judge overseeing the brothers' trial, US District Judge Valerie Caproni, has said that the trial is expected to last about a month, running through the end of February.",

    "description": "Former high-end real estate brokers, Tal and Oren, are accused of sexually assaulting dozens of women with their brother, Alon Alexander.",
    "fullText": "Are Tal and Oren Alexander — once among the nation's top luxury real estate brokers — serial predators who, together with a third brother, drugged and sexually assaulted dozens of women and girls over more than a decade?\n\nOr are they simply womanizers whose party-fueled lifestyle involved lots of consensual sex?\n\nThat's a pivotal question a six-man, six-woman jury will have to consider over the course of Tal, Oren, and Oren's twin, Alon Alexander's sex-trafficking trial that's unfolding over the next several weeks in a Manhattan federal courtroom.\n\nOpening arguments in the criminal case began on January 27, with the Alexanders' defense team and the US government presenting dramatically different, dueling portrayals of the sibling trio.\n\nA conviction could send Tal Alexander, 39, and his 38-year-old twin brothers to prison for life and mark an extraordinary downfall for the real estate agent siblings whose high-profile clients included Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, financier Leon Black, and Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.\n\nHere are some of the most striking moments from the Alexander brothers' trial so far:\n\nAn accuser using the pseudonym \"Katie Moore,\" who was the first government witness to testify, broke down in tears as she told the jury she was drugged and raped by Alon Alexander in 2012 when she was 20 years old.\n\nMoore said that she woke up naked with Alon Alexander standing over her, also naked, at the Manhattan apartment he shared with Tal Alexander, in the hours after an NBA Finals viewing party at the nearby penthouse of actor Zac Efron.\n\n\"I was shocked, and I had no idea how I got there,\" Moore testified, adding that she tried two or three times to get out of the bed, but \"Alon kept pushing me back down.\"\n\n\"I don't want to have sex with you!\" she recalled telling Alon Alexander, who she said laughed and told her, \"But you already did.\"\n\nHe continued to assault her as she desperately screamed out \"no\" over and over, Moore said.\n\nAt some point, Moore testified, Tal Alexander walked in, and as the two brothers were talking, Alon Alexander \"was raping\" her.\n\nShe said she left while Alon Alexander was asleep. Within hours, she discovered she was bruised on the right side of her body, including \"a hand print.\"\n\nDuring opening statements, Assistant US Attorney Madison Reddick Smyser told the jury that the Alexander brothers \"celebrated their crimes.\"\n\n\"For example,\" the prosecutor said, \"after Oren and Alon sexually assaulted three high school girls in a hotel room, Oren texted a friend that he took down a 17-year-old.\"\n\nSmyser said the Alexander brothers used \"power, wealth, and access to lure women and girls to them\" at upscale locales like the Hamptons, Miami, and Manhattan.\n\nSmyser, the Manhattan federal prosecutor, told jurors that the Alexander brothers texted each other about their conquests, at one point saying that \"the only thing that could bring them down is if some 'hoe' complained.\"\n\nThe prosecutor said the Alexander brothers \"used whatever means necessary\" — including drugging victims and using \"brute force\" — to carry out sex attacks.\n\nThey \"carried out their rapes in different ways,\" said Smyser. \"They physically held victims down\" and put drugs like GHB and Xanax in their drinks, getting the women so intoxicated that, in one instance, their victim could not stand up, she said.",

    "fullText": "The Trump administration’s plan for a New Gaza has nothing to do with peace and rebuilding, and everything to do with erasure.\n\nFor those of us who have mourned the loss of countless loved ones killed by the Israeli military over the past 27 months and watched our family homes reduced to rubble, the “New Gaza” vision unveiled by President Donald Trump and Jared Kushner in Davos is an outrageous moral affront. To see AI-generated renderings of luxury high-rises and “coastal tourism zones” atop the literal ruins of our lives is not a vision of peace. It is a blueprint for erasure.\n\nThe plan presented by Kushner—who has deep family ties to Benjamin Netanyahu and a history of funding illegal Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian land in the West Bank—imagines a “New Gaza.” This Gaza is portrayed as a futuristic dreamscape of gleaming apartment blocks, data centers, and luxury towers lining the Mediterranean shore in place of the cities and towns Israel has systematically destroyed—and in fact continues to destroy despite the supposed ceasefire. During his presentation, Kushner praised the value of Gaza’s “waterfront property,” and spoke of planning for “catastrophic success,” effectively recasting mass killing and genocide into an investment opportunity.\n\nThis plan will not achieve peace. It is designed to perpetuate and further entrench a system of Israeli apartheid that has oppressed Palestinians for eight decades, which is the root cause of all the violence between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nEven in a best-case scenario, this plan will likely make Gaza unaffordable for most Palestinians and separate them into “technocratic” camps under the oversight of an “Executive Board” of foreign CEOs run by Trump. Of even greater concern, by prioritizing “industrial zones” and “tech-driven governance” while ignoring Palestinian human rights and Israel’s ongoing campaign to make Gaza unlivable—such that Palestinians have no choice but to leave—this vision amounts to soft ethnic cleansing. Indeed, just a day before revealing this plan, news reports revealed that the Israeli government had been discussing a proposal to reopen the Rafah crossing only on the condition that outbound traffic is prioritized over entry, setting a ratio to ensure that more Palestinians leave the Strip than are allowed to return. This plan is designed to replace our indigenous people and society with a capitalist dystopia where we are merely a cheap labor force behind militarized walls.\n\nTrump and Kushner speak of a “New Gaza” without ever reckoning with Israel’s destruction of the old one. Under this administration’s direction, Gaza is being treated as a distressed asset or a failed start-up awaiting new management, rather than a homeland and the site of a crime scene, with thousands of bodies still missing underneath the rubble.\n\nI owned a home on Gaza’s beach. Israel flattened it last year, as it did tens of thousands of others, damaging or destroying more than 90 percent of all homes in Gaza. No Trump-backed panel of CEOs, autocrats, and leaders of governments complicit in Israel’s genocidal campaign can restore what was stolen by force. Yet, from a conference stage in Davos, they claim the authority to decide what comes next for a people they refuse to even look in the eye.\n\nIf the United States and the international community are serious about moving toward a true and lasting peace, they must abandon these neocolonial plans and pivot toward a solution rooted in freedom, justice, and Palestinian agency.\n\nFor starters, the process must be rooted in Palestinian self-determination; the governance of Gaza must be led by Palestinians, for Palestinians, under a unified national framework—not a “management contract” overseen by foreign trustees. Second, instead of attempting to replace the United Nations system with “free-market principles,” the United States must fully restore funding to UNRWA, ensure unobstructed aid through all crossings, and compel Israel to reverse its ongoing attempts to ban UNRWA and other aid groups from carrying out their critical work. Third, there must be absolute accountability for reconstruction: It must be treated as a legal right and a remedy for the destruction leveled by Israel with US-made weapons, not an ATM for well-connected investors. Finally, there must be a firm political horizon for when the international community recognizes a sovereign, viable Palestinian state within the 1967 borders. Without a clear path to ending Israel’s brutal occupation, any “investment” is simply a way to fund a more comfortable cage.\n\nBut before any of this can happen, Israel must be compelled to finally end its campaign of genocide in Gaza, which, as noted by Amnesty International and others, is ongoing despite the supposed ceasefire announced in October. To achieve this, the international community must move beyond rhetoric and fulfill its legal obligations under the Genocide Convention to prevent further atrocities. This requires the immediate imposition of a comprehensive arms embargo and targeted sanctions on Israel—measures that are not merely political choices but legal imperatives for every signatory committed to halting the destruction of a people.\n\nWhile Israel’s government was consulted in the drafting of Trump’s plan, the Palestinian people—the very subjects of these grand designs—have been deliberately shut out. Decisions about our land, governance, and lives are being finalized in a perversely named “Board of Peace” run by Trump.\n\nTrue peace and rebuilding acknowledge responsibility for the destruction of our homes and lives, and prioritize Palestinian agency. We do not need a “Master Plan” imposed on us by people who do not have our rights or well-being at heart. We need our homeland preserved and rebuilt, and our rights and aspirations centered.",

    "fullText": "The lifestyles of the rich and famous sometimes seem so far out of reach.\n\nWith homes selling for upward of $50 million and billionaires building compounds to disallow regular folks from taking a glance at luxury, one end of the real estate market seems to be growing exponentially.\n\nThose enormous price tags can be jarring when looking for a home, but in reality, the median price of a luxury home is far lower. The entry point of luxury, which is defined as the 90th percentile of listing prices, was $1.19 million in December, according to Realtor.com. That price was about three times the national median home listing price of $399,950.\n\nBut there are some places where luxury, mega-luxury, and standard homes exist side-by-side. While that may seem concerning for those who are looking for affordable homes, these different markets don't always impact each other.\n\n\"Big gaps between luxury and typical home prices aren't automatically a warning sign,\" Realtor.com senior economist Anthony Smith said. \"They often point to markets that are highly segmented, where luxury behaves differently from the rest of the housing market. In those places, even small shifts at the high end can create noticeable changes in luxury pricing without spilling over to the median home price.\"\n\nFlorida, for example, has five metros that ranked in the top 10 on Realtor.com's list of places with the widest luxury gaps in real estate, partially fueled by high-net-worth individuals moving to Florida recently. Miami specifically dethroned the New York City metro area as the city with the most $1 million-plus listings in the country. The influx of high net worth individuals into Miami is also significantly linked to an exodus from the New York metro area: Realtor noted that 26.3% of the Miami metro's demand originates from the New York metro.\n\nThere will always be gaps in the housing market separating one sector from the next. But some luxury markets differ greatly from the sector below.\n\nHere are the top 10 metros where the luxury sector is the most disconnected from the typical market, according to Realtor.com.",

    "fullText": "The robotaxi takeover — assuming they take over — will also be a real estate story.\n\nAs Waymo, Uber, Tesla, and other competitors race to flood the streets with fully autonomous cars, robotaxi operators will need to find places to park, charge, and maintain their vehicles.\n\nVoltera, a charging infrastructure company based in Palo Alto that has partnered with Alphabet-backed Waymo, is buying up real estate now to prep for the AV boom.\n\n\"We need to get shovel-ready assets in the ground,\" Brett Hauser, CEO of Voltera, told Business Insider in an interview. \"You need to buy property in advance of customers.\"\n\nThe hard part isn't finding an empty parcel of land. Robotaxis serve dense, highly populated regions and are all-electric, which means depots need to be close to customers and near a power grid.\n\nOnce the depots are running, there's no guarantee they'll peacefully co-exist with their neighbors.\n\nSan Francisco residents previously reported Waymo's incessant nighttime honking at a charging depot, which the robotaxi company had to fix. In December, the city of Santa Monica filed a lawsuit demanding Waymo halt nighttime charging operations after residents complained about the noise and light pollution. Voltera, which manages Waymo's Santa Monica depot, was also included in the suit.\n\n\"I fully believe that's going to have a favorable outcome,\" Hauser said of the legal battle.\n\nA spokesperson for Waymo did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHauser spoke to Business Insider on how his company is preparing for a rapid influx of robotaxi operations, the challenges behind getting a depot ready for service, and whether the United States' infrastructure is ready for the robotaxi revolution.\n\nThe interview was edited for length and clarity.\n\nTell the readers a little bit about Voltera\n\nVoltera is a developer and operator of charging depots for electric fleets. We've been focusing on the light-duty segment and AVs in particular for the last 12 to 14 months. To date, we have 10 sites operational, mostly geared toward robotaxis — about 400 charging stalls and about 37 megawatts of power. We've got about double that in development right now.\n\nOur approach is to go in and, first of all, buy the real estate. If you control the real estate, you control the timelines. Owning it — and getting the power in a timeline with certainty — is what our customers and the industry need.\n\nI think that is kind of the trickiest part of this.\n\nYou've said building charging depots can feel like \"hand-to-hand combat.\" Why is that?\n\nIt'd be great if there were a national framework for identifying a site, ensuring the zoning is correct, ensuring power is available, and then bringing your construction team in behind it. But every city has its own zoning codes, and what's permissible is going to be different. Every utility has its own process for figuring out where power is available, and what the timeline is to get power, and who pays for it is very different.\n\nIt's not only different city to city, but within a city, it can be very different. In Los Angeles, for example, one side of a street could be Department of Water and Power territory, and the other could be Southern California Edison.\n\nThe other piece of this is we don't have the luxury of always going to where the power is. Data centers can generally look to where power is available and build there. We have to be in and around urban infill areas because you don't want \"deadhead miles,\" where vehicles aren't carrying a passenger and have to go back to base to charge. The depots need to be in and around where the drop-offs and pickups are happening, and that is not easy to find at the right price point.\n\nSo it's really about the orchestration. Any one of those things — finding the real estate, dealing with utility companies — can cause you a problem, so you have to be good at all of it. What works in Los Angeles may not work in Phoenix or Atlanta. The biggest risk is the timeline for getting the power. That's the biggest risk factor in getting these sites out and running.\n\nIf we're talking about hundreds of thousands of robotaxis in the next five years, is the US ready for that?\n\nI don't know that we have that capacity today. If companies like Voltera are out there buying properties and entitling them now — and can give a customer a site within 12 months — then it becomes possible. But for a lot of people, perfecting the ability to find sites and bring power takes much longer. Some people can take 36 to 48 months, but depending on power availability and whether substation upgrades are needed, it can take longer.\n\nSo I think it's aspirational. We can knock a big piece of that out, but I don't know that you can have purpose-built depots at that scale in that timeframe.\n\nSanta Monica has become a high-profile example of community friction with robotaxi and robotaxi depots. Was that something Voltera anticipated? And does it change Voltera's definition of the right location?\n\nI think that's a very fair question. Let me start by saying that everything was done properly — zoning, permitting, above board, and by the book at this site. A couple of neighbors are frustrated and might remain so, no matter what gets done. I can't get into their head and discuss that.\n\nCommunity outreach and engagement are important, and we did do that in this case. I think people are, for the first time, experiencing robotaxis: the joys, the benefits, and sometimes some of the challenges.\n\nWith Santa Monica, I think we've built a very good site — to code and to spec —and you've got partners willing to do the right things on behalf of the city and residents. I fully believe that's going to have a favorable outcome.",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nGiven how much real estate prices have soared in America, many homeowners may be feeling richer than ever. But real estate mogul Grant Cardone says your house isn’t a smart investment — far from it.\n\nIn a January interview with podcaster Sean Kelly, Cardone said, “a house is not something that people should be buying. They should rent (1).”\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nGet early access to privately-held AI companies with Fundrise Venture Capital for as little as $10. Join 350,000+ investors today\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nThat may seem ironic coming from someone known for investing in residential real estate. But it’s not the first time Cardone has tackled this issue, saying in a separate video on TikTok that buying a home “is a terrible investment (2).”\n\nHe was quick to explain why: “[A home] doesn’t [give] cash flow. You don't get big tax write-offs because of it. You have no leverage. You're living in it. You're paying for it. You never own it. Even when the loan is paid, you don't own it. You still got to pay property taxes, still got to insure, still got to maintain it.”\n\nWhen you buy a home to live in, it’s true that it won’t necessarily generate any cash flow. And even once the mortgage is paid off, there are still ongoing costs: property taxes, insurance premiums, repairs and maintenance. And they can add up fast.\n\nThe median monthly ownership costs for U.S. homeowners with a mortgage increased by around 4% from 2024 to 2025, based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau (3). In a related press release, census data revealed that homeowners with a mortgage are spending more than 20% of their income on additional homeownership costs.\n\nCardone suggests a simple reason that these costs are ignored, alongside the downsides of homeownership.\n\n“People get emotional about their house — ‘It’s my house!’” he said. “It ain’t your house. You're a partner in this house with the state.”\n\nCardone’s suggestion is simple: “Never buy a house, rent where you live.”\n\nBut that doesn’t mean he’s against real estate entirely.\n\n“I'm not saying ‘don't own real estate,’” he clarified. “I'm saying live in a house and pay rent. Take all the money that you would have spent on that house and invest in real estate that [has] cash flows — that pays you every month.”",

    "description": "Real estate investor Grant Cardone said that talks with administration insiders hint at a few things Trump could do next to boost the market.",
    "fullText": "Grant Cardone thinks the Trump administration is gearing up to do more to stimulate the US housing market.\n\nThe longtime real estate investor says he's bullish on housing as the market enters a new year, even as home prices remain high and mortgage rates are elevated.\n\nCardone told Business Insider that he recently spoke with administration insiders about what he thinks can still be done to open up the market to more Americans.\n\nPresident Trump has made affordability a primary focus in 2026 ahead of the midterm elections. In his address at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, he discussed high housing costs as well as interest rates, stating that the goal of homeownership is out of reach for many Americans.\n\nTrump so far has focused on mortgage rates and housing availability, pitching plans to have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac load up on mortgage bonds while also banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes.\n\nNext, Cardone thinks Trump could address issues in the tax code to make the market easier to navigate.\n\nHe predicts that the White House will adjust capital gains taxes for home sales to make it less prohibitive to sell a property that has appreciated in value.\n\nCurrently, homeowners can exclude $500,000 in capital gains for married filers or $250,000 for single filers when they sell their home. Cardone expects the caps to be raised, which would make the tax bill much less burdensome and potentially bring more homes to market.\n\nOther commentators have flagged this as a simple fix to the market that can be done with relative ease. Mark Zandi, the top economist at Moody's Analytics, said last year that the caps should be raised to $500,000 for single filers and $1,000,000 for joint filers.\n\nThe other potential change Trump could make would allow more people to invest in real estate.\n\n\"I think he's going to come out and say, 'hey, I want to extend that bonus depreciation that was approved in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA),\" Cardone said. \"He's going to extend it to single-family homes.\"\n\n\"Bonus depreciation\" is a mechanism that allows investors to deduct the cost of a property from their taxes. The landmark tax and spending bill signed into law last year allows investors to deduct 100% of qualifying investment properties immediately.\n\n\"When I buy these big assets, I get to write them off basically in year one,\" Cardone explained. \"And when you buy a single-family home, you write it off over 27 years, you get a tax loss spread over that period.\"\n\nCardone thinks this would be significant, as it has never been done in the US and could stimulate more housing market activity by extending buying power to those seeking income-producing properties.\n\nWhile Cardone said his predictions have been informed by talks with administration insiders, a spokesperson denied that any specific policy moves were under discussion.\n\n\"President Trump pledged to put an end to Joe Biden's inflation and affordability crisis, and the Administration is constantly exploring new policy actions to do just that, \"White House spokesperson Davis Ingle told Business Insider. \"Until policy announcements are officially made by the Administration, however, any reporting about potential action is pure speculation.\"",

    "description": "Real estate developer, Sam Slater, has paid the millionaire tax in Massachusetts since 2023. He plans on staying, but has considered moving.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sam Slater, a 41-year-old real estate developer based in Boston. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was born in South Florida, where my parents and uncle currently live, and I moved to Massachusetts when I was 10 years old.\n\nI run our family office, which is based in both Boston and Palm Beach, Florida. We have business ventures across multiple industries, but my focus is on our real estate portfolio. From light industrial to agricultural to multifamily real estate, we're well-diversified across many states in the US, as well as Canada.\n\nIt's been interesting to see an increase in national interest in the Massachusetts millionaire's tax as some initiatives in other states come up. I have friends in other markets who have been asking about it. Since its implementation in 2023, the obvious question to me is, why wouldn't I move back to Florida?\n\nThe truth is, I often think about moving, but I feel strongly about why I'm staying. It's all for my kids.\n\nIn addition to my focus on real estate, I also work in the sports and entertainment industry. I hold a minority ownership stake in the Seattle Kraken, an NHL team, and last year, I joined the ownership group of the Memphis Grizzlies. I'm very active in the world of sport, and it's been a really enjoyable and successful venture. Over the past 15 years, I've also produced over 40 feature films.\n\nWith the progression of state taxes in the last few years, particularly the millionaire tax, I've seen many people, including friends in the hedge fund, private equity, and finance spaces, move or confirm their plans to do so. However, I'm in a slightly different situation.\n\nI have two younger children, a 7 and 10-year-old, and I would prefer them to grow up here with all that Massachusetts has to offer.\n\nWe live in a town with a wonderful public school system, and I don't want to take that away from them. More broadly, eastern Massachusetts and Boston, in particular, are highly accessible areas and offer a lot. We've got everything from sports to culture, and all four seasons. I don't want to pull my kids from that for my desire to pay less in taxes.\n\nIf my children weren't young, maybe my answer would be different.\n\nIt's difficult to say if any changes I've seen in Massachusetts are a direct result of this particular tax. The broader market conditions in the economy are, in certain areas, quite strong, while in other areas, they are not.\n\nIf you take condominium sales in downtown Boston, we're at extraordinarily low points both for pricing and velocity, especially if we're looking back on a 10 or 15-year horizon. I think it would probably be a stretch to say it's solely because of this tax, but high earners leaving Massachusetts removes potential high-end condominium buyers from the market.\n\nFortunately, I haven't had to make any lifestyle changes because of the wealth tax, but I'm certainly aware of the taxes I pay in general, specifically as a result of this tax. My question is, what will come next after this?\n\nWhat remains to be seen is how the additional revenue brought in to Massachusetts from this tax will trickle back to everyone in the Commonwealth.\n\nIf taxes continue to increase and no one can point to any substantial changes being made in the state, I think that's when we'll see a more meaningful exodus of people, even potentially myself, from Massachusetts.\n\nThe Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, our public transit system, has struggled for a long time, and it needs huge investments in its infrastructure and operations. Will we see a boost there? I don't know.\n\nThere are two bridges that connect mainland Massachusetts to Cape Cod, and they're nearly 100 years old. They were going to be replaced at a multi-billion-dollar cost, but some of the funding was cut due to the Trump Administration. Will we see some help for those projects?\n\nI'm wondering if there's anything that will be done to truly help move us forward, rather than just keep us afloat with the existing programs we have at the state budget level. I think more people who are paying the millionaire's tax would be on board if there were a more complete message about how the tax dollars would be used.\n\nIt's certainly something that people are watching and aware of, with good reason.\n\nDo you have a story to share about paying a wealth tax? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "“The dreaded mortgage rate ‘lock-in’ effect is fading,” said real estate investor and Reventure CEO Nick Gerli.",
    "fullText": "During the pandemic-era housing market, homebuyers enjoyed sub-3% rates, ushering in a wave of homebuying among younger generations. But in the following few years, the American Dream came crashing down as mortgage rates and home prices rose, and inflation and wage stagnation set in.\n\nThat meant more homeowners in the U.S. had sub-3% mortgage rates compared with today’s 6%-range rates, creating a lock-in effect in which current homeowners refused to let go of their low mortgage rates and sell their homes only to turn around and face a much higher mortgage rate.\n\nBut now there’s a crack in the lock-in effect: Real estate investor and Reventure CEO Nick Gerli recently said that as of the end of 2025, there are actually now more homeowners with mortgage rates higher than 6% than borrowers locked into sub-3% rates, ending one of the most generous eras for home financing in modern history.\n\n“Something big just happened in the U.S. Housing Market,” Gerli wrote in a Jan. 3 X post, referring to the change in share of homeowners with sub-3% mortgage rates. That means the “the dreaded Mortgage Rate ‘Lock-In’ Effect is fading.”\n\nDuring the lock-in effect period, millions of existing homeowners with ultra-low rates have been financially disincentivized to move or “trade up,” i.e., buy a more expensive or larger home, which made the number of homes for sale scarce for would-be homebuyers. This led to younger-generation bidding wars for a limited pool of starter homes and kept many locked out of the market. In fact, the average first-time homebuyer age skyrocketed to 40 in 2025, according to the National Association of Realtors, and the share of first-time home buyers plummeted to a record low of 21%.\n\n“The historically low share of first-time buyers underscores the real-world consequences of a housing market starved for affordable inventory,” Jessica Lautz, NAR deputy chief economist and vice president of research, said in a statement. “The share of first-time buyers in the market has contracted by 50% since 2007—right before the Great Recession.”\n\nBut that all could change, Gerli said, since fewer homeowners have the attractive sub-3% mortgage rate.\n\n“Since more existing owners have a higher rate, that means more have a payment and rate closer to ‘market,’” he explained, “which means there will be more incentive to sell – which is actually good news.” Gerli analyzed Q3 2025 data from Fannie Mae’s mortgage database .\n\nGerli’s analysis shows the share of mortgages with rates of 6% or higher has surged from about 7% in 2022 to roughly 20% by late 2025, overtaking the once‑dominant pool of pandemic‑era borrowers with sub-3 % rates. Those pandemic-era loans peaked at nearly 25% of all outstanding loans in 2021, the analysis shows, but that share has been steadily shrinking as new buyers take out higher‑cost loans and older-generation buyers move or refinance.​",

    "fullText": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nMost lottery winners make a beeline for luxury real estate, buying up seven-bedroom mansions with koi ponds, glass walls, and garages that look like car museums. But one lucky Virginian with $155.6 million in their pocket decided to celebrate differently—with a lawn mower. Not just any lawn mower, either. A zero-turn riding mower. Call it humble. Call it hilarious. Either way, it's a far cry from the Hollywood Hills.\n\nThe anonymous winner of Virginia's largest-ever jackpot—a $348 million Mega Millions haul—walked into the state lottery office, cashed out with the lump sum, and made one wish known: they planned to mow their lawn in style. That's not exactly the plotline My Lottery Dream Home was built around. In fact, the entire HGTV show banks on winners going house-hunting for multimillion-dollar properties—mountaintop estates in Colorado, beachfront retreats in Florida, or swanky Texas compounds. Not pushin' a mower down the driveway.\n\nFor context, Edwin Castro, who won a record $2.04 billion Powerball jackpot in California in 2022, spent a chunk of his cash on three mansions: a $25.5 million glass-box home in Hollywood Hills, a $4 million Zen-inspired retreat in Altadena, and a $47 million Bel Air estate complete with koi pond, naturally. That was all before he started stockpiling vintage Porsches. He may never touch a weed-whacker again.\n\nThe ‘ChatGPT of Marketing' just opened a $0.85/share round — 10,000+ investors are already in.\n\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.\n\nBut this Virginia winner? They're bucking the cliché. And ironically, that low-key decision might be a smarter financial move than buying a $40 million mega-mansion with upkeep costs that chew through millions annually. Real estate is still a top-tier wealth-building tool—but owning it and living in it are two very different games.\n\nBut here's the twist: skipping the mansion might actually be the more financially sound move.\n\nHomeownership remains one of the most powerful ways to build wealth. According to the Federal Reserve's latest data, the median homeowner has 43 times more net worth than the median renter. That wealth gap isn't just about property value—it's also about stability, appreciation, and the ability to leverage equity.\n\nUnfortunately, homeownership has become a high-barrier dream for many. Mortgage rates are high, starter homes are scarce, and even modest properties come with hefty down payments, bidding wars, and monthly payments that rival luxury rents.",

    "description": "Find out why Louisville real estate investors Mike Gorius and Kevin Hart are moving from flipping in 2026 and leaning into the BRRRR method.",
    "fullText": "After completing more than 50 deals last year, real estate investors Mike Gorius and Kevin Hart aren't slowing down — but they are changing strategy.\n\nIn 2025, the pair closed about the same number of deals as the year before, while nearly doubling their revenue by going bigger.\n\n\"We probably only did a couple more deals than in 2024, but our deal size almost doubled,\" Gorius told Business Insider. \"We did about 52 deals last year and grossed around $500,000. This year, we did 54 deals and grossed just over a million.\"\n\nIn 2026, the business partners, who primarily invest in Louisville, say they are moving away from the strategy that helped them get their start in real estate: flipping.\n\n\"In 2026, we expect to do fewer flips,\" Gorius said. \"Unless it's an absolute home run, it just doesn't make as much sense in this market.\"\n\nHart and Gorius said that their market has cooled significantly, making quick flip exits harder to count on.\n\n\"Since around September, the market has dropped pretty significantly,\" Hart said. \"In Louisville, we've gone from about 2,500 homes on the market to nearly 3,900. Days on market have tripled — now it's over a month, sometimes even two.\"\n\nThe slowdown makes it even more imperative that they land a good deal on the front end, he added: \"If you overpay for a property, you're not getting like 10 offers in the first 24 hours. It may sit on market for a month because you overpriced it, and then the price just continues to drop. So you really have to make sure you're buying at the right price.\"\n\nInstead of relying on flips, Gorius and Hart plan to lean more heavily into BRRRR projects in 2026.\n\nShort for buy, rehab, rent, refinance, repeat, the BRRRR strategy involves renovating a property, renting it out, and then refinancing to pull out capital — ideally recouping most or all of the initial investment while retaining ownership of the asset.\n\nThe approach isn't risk-free. You still have to make sure your numbers work and you can hit the value you're expecting, Hart pointed out: \"From the get-go, you still have the risk of rehab and the risk of running correct costs to make sure that you can actually get a good appraisal.\"\n\nBut compared to flipping, BRRRR offers a more predictable exit.\n\n\"You're taking out the risk of the market,\" explained Hart. Instead of worrying about a flip sitting for months while you're paying interest, \"you know that at the end of the rehab you can get a tenant in there and you can immediately refinance with the bank.\"\n\nIt may not result in quick cash like a successful flip can, but they're playing the long game anyways.\n\nEven if a BRRRR doesn't pencil out perfectly in the short term, holding onto the asset can still pay off over time, said Gorius: \"The truth is, in real estate, time does heal all.\"\n\nIf you have to bring $10,000 to the table to refinance and pay off a private lender, at least you still own the asset, he added: \"You can put tenants in there, and maybe you lose $100 a month at first — not saying Kevin and I do this — but over time, rent will go up and eventually, you'll get that $10,000 back. Eventually, you won't lose $100 a month — you'll make $100.\"",

    "description": "Fed up with rent, café owner Isreal Adeyanju and a friend bought the building. He shared his tips on co-investing in real estate.",
    "fullText": "Isreal Adeyanju co-owns Kọ Café, a West African coffee shop in New Jersey that attracts locals for its food and community events, including open mic nights, live podcast recordings, and workshops on homeownership and career development.\n\nWhen the café opened in 2023, Adeyanju was renting the space for $1,400 a month. But when the 3,600-square-foot building, which includes two upstairs apartments, went up for sale, Adeyanju and one of the café's co-owners, Samuel Osei-Afriyie, moved to buy the entire property.\n\nWith the help of investors, Adeyanju and Osei-Afriyie bought the building for $740,000. They own 85% of it, and their investors own the remaining 15%.\n\n\"Part of the reason we bought the building was so our café wouldn't face a sudden rent hike,\" Adeyanju told Business Insider. \"There are several cafés in Jersey that have closed because their rent doubled.\"\n\nSince 2024, the two apartments above the café — both three-bedroom, two-bath units — have been rented short-term, bringing in more than $100,000 through Airbnb. The earnings have helped pay down the building's mortgage.\n\n\"The money we make from Airbnb helps keep our business alive,\" Adeyanju said. \"It's not about getting rich quick; it's about being able to sustain ourselves, this building, and build wealth.\"\n\nHere are some things people should keep in mind when investing in real estate with a friend, according to Adeyanju.\n\nPurchasing a property that combines a business and residential space can be more complicated than buying a traditional home. It often involves more money, more red tape, and, at times, bigger headaches.\n\nAdeyanju said that buying the mixed-use building with a friend made the whole process feel much less stressful.\n\n\"I do think that it feels better when you're investing in real estate with somebody else,\" he said. \"You're willing to take on more of a risk because you know that if something goes wrong, somebody is going to be there with you.\"\n\nWhen Adeyanju and Osei-Afriyie purchased the property, they opened a zero-interest credit card, which they used to cover their initial renovation costs and continue to use for maintenance expenses.\n\n\"As time goes on, we rely on our reserves to cover ongoing costs, so we haven't had to pay out of pocket for any expenses,\" Adeyanju said.\n\nHe said that the entire setup would collapse if there wasn't already a strong foundation of trust between him and Osei-Afriyie.\n\n\"When buying a property with a friend, I think the first and most important thing is trust,\" he said. \"It was critical for us — especially in the beginning — because a lot of capital was being pooled into a shared account.\"\n\nInitially, the apartments above the home were listed for short-term Airbnb stays, but they later transitioned to long-term rentals. Their bookings now typically last 28 to 30 days and average between $140 and $175 per night.\n\nAt first, Adeyanju and Osei-Afriyie shared management duties, but about six months in, Adeyanju took on most of the day-to-day work because his schedule was more flexible.\n\n\"With the management mostly falling on me, we agreed to negotiate a management fee or a fee structure that compensates for that sweat equity,\" Adeyanju said.\n\nAdeyanju said that setting clear expectations around labor and management helps keep things running smoothly and makes sure everyone feels fairly treated.\n\nAdeyanju said that sharing the same vision for the property is one of the most critical aspects of co-buying — without it, things can become complicated quickly.\n\n\"We had to understand each other's individual goals,\" he said. \"Sam and I both recognized that this was a key investment, not just for our future portfolios, but also to ensure the long-term security of our café.\"\n\nHe and Osei-Afriyie planned carefully before purchasing the building, considering every detail, from how they would divide costs to how they would manage repairs and a potential sale.\n\nThey do not expect to sell the building anytime soon, but if they ever do, they already have a contingency plan in place.\n\nAxel Springer, Insider Inc.'s parent company, is an investor in Airbnb.",

Realtor.com reported that the third mansion, where he and his wife Lauren Sánchez Bezos currently live, is a temporary residence while the other property is being finished.\n\nThe Amazon founder purchased a $68 million mansion and an adjacent property for $79 million in 2023, then made a third purchase in 2024 for $90 million. In November 2023, Bezos announced that he would be moving to Miami after living in Seattle for 29 years.\n\nThe lot that sold next door to Bezos' adjoining properties originally had an asking price of $200 million. That listing first went live in December 2024. By April of the following year, the price had dropped to $130 million.\n\nIlya Reznik, who represented the sellers, told Business Insider in 2024 that the high price was due to the unique location — and the arrival of Bezos.\n\nBezos \"did pay the numbers, which are really high,\" Reznik said. \"But now those prices are there and the market is there and higher.\"\n\nMiami-Dade property records show Reznik's clients, who did not want to be identified, bought the property for $27,500,000 in 2018. While the previous owners never built anything on the property, the listing notes that predesigns for a 25,000-square-foot estate on the property would be available to the buyer.\n\nThe buyer used a trust managed by Miami attorney Joseph Hernandez, according to records, but the buyer's identity remains unknown.\n\nIndian Creek is about 15 miles from Miami. The highly secure island is accessible only by a single bridge connecting it to the mainland. It has about 40 homes over 300 acres and an ultra-exclusive country club. The island's police department monitors the area's only entrance and patrols the perimeter around the clock.",

    "description": "Blackstone valued its real estate portfolio, which includes vacation destinations across the globe, at $611 billion.",
    "fullText": "A vacation destination nestled off the coast of Australia will soon be owned by Blackstone, the US-based investment firm.\n\nBlackstone announced on December 23 that it entered an agreement to acquire Hamilton Island. Outlets, including the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, said the deal is worth $1.2 billion.\n\n\"This investment, which is subject to customary regulatory approvals, builds on Blackstone's leading global position in leisure and hospitality, including in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region, where it has made significant investments across Australia, Japan, and India,\" Blackstone said in a press release.\n\nBlackstone valued its real estate portfolio, which includes numerous vacation destinations worldwide, at $611 billion as of September 2025.\n\nHere is what Blackstone is getting with its latest purchase.\n\nHamilton Island is part of the Whitsunday Islands chain in Queensland, located off the northeast coast of Australia. The Ngaro people originally lived on the Whitsunday Islands, which are near the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nTourists from Australia's outback and southern region began vacationing at Hamilton Island in the 1920s, according to the Hamilton Island tourism website.\n\nHamilton Island transformed into a resort destination in the 1980s under Keith Williams, who owned and operated the island for two decades, according to the tourism website.\n\nDuring that time, he built Hamilton Island's marina and a resort. The island was later acquired by the family of Bob Oatley, a famous Australian winemaker.\n\nThe Hamilton Island tourism website said the Oatley family spends millions of dollars each year on upgrading the infrastructure, accommodations, and services.\n\nHamilton Island measures 2,800 acres across two islands. There are five hotels, 20 retailers, over 20 restaurants and bars, a marina, a golf course, and a commercial airport.\n\nAbout 70% of the area remains undeveloped, Blackstone said.\n\nHamilton Island is located near the Great Barrier Reef, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. As a result, significant efforts are made to preserve the area.\n\nIn addition to sustainable waste disposal, the tourism site said the island has nature-based experiences to educate guests, island-wide erosion and sediment control measures, water treatment plans, liquid composters, and more.\n\nHamilton Island has a range of activities for guests, including ATV riding for children, snorkeling, mountain biking, a golf club, a yacht club, and more.\n\nHamilton Island's position near the Coral Sea makes it an ideal destination for sailing, a popular activity among visitors. In addition to the marina and local yacht club, Hamilton Island has hosted an annual sailing race week for four decades.\n\nThe next race week is scheduled for August 2026.\n\nNearly two decades ago, Queensland's tourism office launched a campaign encouraging people to apply for the \"Best Job in the World\": a six-month stint as a caretaker on Hamilton Island.\n\nQueensland's tourism website said the winner, Ben Southall, beat out over 34,000 applicants from over 200 countries. The BBC reported that the position came with a $150,000 salary and a luxury villa for accommodation.",

    "description": "GDP growth isn't helping young Americans.",
    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nAs a co-founder of PayPal and the first outside investor in Facebook, Peter Thiel is widely recognized for his expertise in tech. But now, the billionaire venture capitalist is sounding the alarm on an entirely different sector: real estate.\n\nDuring an interview with Commonwealth Canada, Thiel drew upon the insights of 19th-century economist Henry George to underscore the gravity of America’s real estate crisis (1).\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\n“The basic Georgist obsession was real estate, and it was if you weren't really careful, you would get runaway real estate prices, and the people who owned the real estate would make all the gains in a society,” Thiel said.\n\nThe core of the issue, Thiel explained, lies in the “extremely inelastic” nature of real estate, especially in regions with strict zoning laws.\n\n“The dynamic ends up being that you add 10% to the population in a city, and maybe the house prices go up 50%, and maybe people's salaries go up, but they don't go up by 50%,” he said. “So the GDP grows, but it's a giant windfall to the boomer homeowners and to the landlords, and it's a massive hit to the lower-middle class and to young people who can never get on the housing ladder.”\n\nThiel warned that this “Georgist real estate catastrophe” is playing out across many “Anglosphere countries,” including the U.S., Britain and Canada.\n\nThe surge in U.S. home prices has been nothing short of alarming for non-homeowners. Over the past five years, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index has climbed by 45% (2). This indicates that, on average, the value of a single-family home in the U.S. has nearly doubled in that five-year period.\n\nThough there is reason to believe that growth could be slowing down. A Reuters poll of property experts suggests that U.S. home prices will rise just 1.4% in 2026 (3). While that increase would be relatively minimal compared to the last few years, it’s nevertheless an increase.\n\nThiel connected growing prices to inflation, stating, “There's a way you could talk about inflation in terms of the prices of eggs or groceries, but that's not that big a cost item, even for lower-middle-class people. The really big cost item is the rent.”",

    "description": "A trio of traders who rose to fame betting against the US housing market told Business Insider they see a continuation of debasement trade in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry gets a lot of attention these days, but there were a handful of other traders who also saw the collapse of US housing market coming from a mile away.\n\nThree of them told Business Insider recently that they're all betting on the same macro development in 2026.\n\nAmong the traders who rose to fame during the subprime mortgage crisis were the members of a small investing firm called FrontPoint Partners. They included Danny Moses, Vinny Daniel, and Porter Collins. All three have left the company and now collaborate on a Substack and podcast titled What Are We Doing?, on which they discuss contrarian investment takes.\n\nBusiness Insider recently asked all three traders about their highest conviction calls heading into 2026, and each had a similar answer.\n\nIn short, the trio highlighted a slow-burning macro shift that they see putting pressure on the US dollar.\n\nThe stock market has enjoyed a year of mostly upward momentum in 2025, primarily benefitting from the AI trade, an area Moses has expressed some skepticism about. But the three traders are maintaining a fairly cautious outlook as they prepare for the coming year.\n\nMoses told Business Insider that if he had to express his high conviction macro view for 2026 through one trade, it would be betting on gold, a cornerstone of his investing strategy for several years.\n\nHe believes that even after gold's breakout year, the precious metal is poised for more growth as the dollar's standing as the world's reserve currency wanes. He noted that he doesn't see anything ahead that could derail gold's rally.\n\n\"Between the geopolitics and the sovereign debt levels, I think it just continues to move higher,\" he said. \"To me, gold is the thing that people should watch as an indication for economic stability or macroeconomic stability, including the US dollar.\"\n\nMoses highlighted a weakened US dollar, noting that a decline in the US currency tends to coincide with strong gold prices.\n\nVincent Daniel, now the co-founder of investment firm Seawolf Capital, also saw a continuation of the debasement trade in 2026. \n\n\"Even though it's been an incredible trade, we think it's going to continue, albeit maybe with a little bit more fits and starts, but we think it'll outperform the S&P,\" he stated.\n\nDaniel said that his firm sees significant growth potential in emerging markets, specifically China and Brazil. He added that while many business-friendly governments have come to power in Latin America recently, Brazil has high interest rates and real rates of return, in addition to attractively priced stocks.\n\nCollins, a portfolio manager at Seawolf Capital, initially hesitated to express one high-conviction macro trade for 2026. However, like Moses, he pointed to the US dollar's ongoing decline, adding that he sees it losing its value against precious metals, naming gold as a key example.\n\n\"I don't know if I have a high conviction around it, but I have a general view that's going to occur,\" he said.\n\nThat said, Collins added that gold prices look stretched and he isn't ruling out a pullback in early 2026.",

    "description": "This isn’t the first time Zuckerberg has clashed with neighbors over real estate projects.",
    "fullText": "Billionaire Mark Zuckerberg has been rankling his neighbors in Palo Alto as he works on expanding and modifying the 11 homes that he has purchased in the area. To smooth over tensions, The New York Times says Zuckerberg gifted his next-door neighbors noise-canceling headphones as a peace offering.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, the billionaire cofounder of Facebook and CEO of Meta, reportedly gave noise-canceling headphones to his neighbors in the Crescent Park neighborhood of Palo Alto in an effort to address years of frustration over ongoing construction and disruption surrounding his expanding residential compound, according to The New York Times.\n\nZuckerberg has spent more than $110 million purchasing at least 11 homes on Edgewood Drive and Hamilton Avenue over the past 14 years, transforming this once-idyllic neighborhood of lawyers, business executives, and Stanford University professors into a zone dominated by construction equipment, surveillance, and frequent lavish parties.\n\nSome of these properties that were recently purchased sit unoccupied, despite being in a region known for its acute housing shortage, while others have been converted into guest homes, lush gardens, a pickleball court, a pool with a hydrofloor, and—at least for a time—a private school for Zuckerberg’s children and several others (a use that appears not to comply with local zoning ordinances).\n\nUnderneath the compound, Zuckerberg added 7,000 square feet of space described as “basements,” which to area residents are more akin to “bunkers” or a “billionaire’s bat cave.” Zuckerberg similarly added a 5,000-square-foot underground structure to his compound in Hawaii, which he insists is not a “doomsday bunker.”\n\nMuch of the discontent centers on the nearly eight years of continual construction. Several neighbors cited street blockages, debris, and relentless noise as ongoing issues.\n\nA spokesperson for Mark Zuckerberg provided the following statement to Fortune:\n\n“Mark, Priscilla and their children have made Palo Alto their home for more than a decade. They value being members of the community and have taken a number of steps above and beyond any local requirements to avoid disruption in the neighborhood.”\n\nThe noise-canceling headphones were among several gifts extended by Zuckerberg’s staff to appease neighbors during particularly loud periods, along with bottles of sparkling wine and boxes of Krispy Kreme doughnuts. These gestures, however, have not always been effective. Some of his neighbors say their community has been transformed—and not in a good way—by absentee ownership, strict privacy barriers, and heavy security presence, including cameras overlooking adjacent properties and frequent patrols by private security guards.\n\nMeta didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis is not Zuckerberg’s first clash with neighbors over real estate projects. In 2016, Palo Alto officials rejected a proposal to demolish four homes and replace them with smaller houses and large basements as part of a wider compound. While the city denied the specific application, Zuckerberg ultimately proceeded gradually, undertaking similar work in a piecemeal fashion to avoid further regulatory hurdles. The Palo Alto City Council and some residents have since criticized what they describe as the exploitation of zoning loopholes and the city’s regulatory inaction.\n\nZuckerberg’s residential portfolio extends far beyond Palo Alto. He owns a 2,300-acre estate in Kauai, Hawaii, where his land acquisitions and building plans have at times provoked local controversy as well. He also owns homes at Lake Tahoe and a mansion in Washington, D.C.\n\nA version of this story was published at Fortune.com on Aug. 26, 2025.\n\nZuckerberg defends Meta’s spending spree, says ‘the risk is higher on the other side’\n\n‘The Social Network’ nailed Mark Zuckerberg’s wardrobe, Facebook founder admits\n\nWhy Mark Zuckerberg says the ‘most important thing’ he built at Harvard was a prank website\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "description": "\"It's always a good time to be deal hunting during a distracted market,\" says real-estate agent and investor Dana Bull.",
    "fullText": "The holiday season might not seem like a big window of opportunity for prospective homebuyers to get their bids seen by sellers, but one real estate agent argues it's actually an ideal time to score a deal.\n\nIf real-estate investor and agent Dana Bull was looking to expand her portfolio, she'd be putting in offers in late December — specifically, two days before Christmas.\n\nDecember 23 is her \"favorite day of the year to submit an offer,\" she told Business Insider. \"I find that sellers are very interested in getting a deal done going into the holidays or going into this year.\"\n\nBull works in real estate in a variety of capacities: She's a licensed agent, does real-estate consulting and coaching, and is a seasoned investor who owns multi-family and single-family homes throughout Massachusetts.\n\nShe's learned that if you want to land a good deal on a property, timing matters.\n\n\"It's always a good time to be deal hunting during a distracted market,\" Bull said — and people tend to be distracted over the holidays. \"Most people are just in coast mode, but if you're not in coast mode or if you can take yourself out of coast mode, this is such a great time.\"\n\nStarting a negotiation a few days before Christmas is a good time for several reasons.\n\n\"In general, people are in good spirits, and sellers tend to feel a sense of relief if they receive an offer because they usually aren't expecting one,\" she said. \"Christmas Eve puts a deadline to get things wrapped up with the negotiating and creates a sense of urgency.\"\n\nShe says she would avoid submitting an offer on actual holidays — \"it's a bit rude and unrealistic to get a response\" — but the days following Christmas are fair game. \"I almost always submit an offer that week. It's a time of great reflection, and sellers are generally motivated to put a deal together so they can enter the new year with a plan in place.\"\n\nThe holiday window of opportunity is small. A couple of weeks into January, \"it's like a light switch comes back on,\" she said, noting that mid-January is one of her busiest times of the year for consultations. \"What I've noticed is this herd mentality where everybody just ebbs and flows at the same time, so if you can be flowing when everybody else is ebbing, this is when you can negotiate.\"\n\nThat said, \"You don't want to make a bad purchase just because it's a good time of year,\" Bull added, but if you can carve out time to look for deals when most other investors aren't, you could be rewarded.\n\n\"There are always these pockets, like the Fourth of July is another great time where people have signed off, and I'm almost always working with somebody that weekend to try to scrounge something up.\"\n\nSeasonal swings aren't a myth, and they can be significant. In her market, for example, \"Massachusetts has huge seasonal swings in average pricing by like $100,000.\"\n\nIn the markets where Bull is active, in the winter, \"prices always come down,\" she added. \"And then they're going to start to climb. Then, in the summer they come back down again and they climb again in the fall. Every year it's the same quarterly trend, so if you are looking to buy a house, right now is one of the best times.\"\n\nThis story was originally published on December 9, 2024.",

    "fullText": "Analysts see ‘global construction frenzy that shows no signs of slowing’ amid surge in demand from AI boom\n\nA new report finds that investment in the worldwide data center market reached $61bn this year, setting a new record atop the wave of the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nThe analysis by S&P Global, first reported by CNBC, documented what the market intelligence firm called a “global construction frenzy that shows no signs of slowing”, to build out the massive real estate, hardware, and energy requirements driven by insatiable demand from AI companies. S&P pegged 2024’s investment in the data center market at $60.8bn, just below the 2025 number.\n\n“Unable to buy, many investors are turning to new builds,” wrote Iuri Struta, an analyst for S&P Global.\n\nThere are approximately 500 data centers in the United Kingdom, compared with about 4,000 in the United States, according to Data Center Map, which tracks the facilities globally.\n\nStruta, the S&P Global analyst, said he does not see the demand for data centers slowing.\n\n“The global data center footprint is projected to expand at a faster rate over the next five years than it did in the previous five, spurred by demand for energy- and computer-intensive AI workloads,” said Struta.\n\nS&P Global’s report comes at a time when some investors worry that the entire artificial intelligence sector may be in the midst of huge overspending for unproven ongoing returns.\n\nLast week, Oracle’s shares dropped 11% after it reported lower quarterly earnings than analysts had expected, which in turn dragged the stock prices on some other major companies in AI. Some companies such as Oracle, along with Nvidia and OpenAI, have been criticized recently for making deals with one another that seem circular to many investors.\n\nEarlier this year, the International Energy Agency noted in a lengthy report that, globally, “electricity demand for data centres more than doubles by 2030”, reaching 945 terawatt hours (TWh), or just more than “Japan’s total electricity consumption today”.\n\nThis month, a trio of analysts from Deutsche Bank put out a staggering chart indicating that OpenAI alone will burn through $143bn between 2024 and 2029, the year before the company claims it will turn a profit. That chart shows how much more the ChatGPT maker, seen as a bellwether of the AI industry, plans to spend relative to other tech giants of the last two decades, including Amazon, Tesla and Uber, reached profitability.\n\n“Of course, OpenAI may continue to attract significant funding and could ultimately develop products that generate substantial profits and revolutionise the world,” Jim Reid, managing director, global head of macro research and thematic strategy at Deutsche Bank, wrote.\n\n“But at present, no startup in history has operated with losses on anything approaching this scale. We are firmly in uncharted territory.”",

    "description": "While big players such as Blackstone, KKR and Bain Capital are buying in, Fernando de Leon, founder of Leon Capital Group, said he is sitting out.",
    "fullText": "A version of this article first appeared in the CNBC Property Play newsletter with Diana Olick. Property Play covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, from individuals to venture capitalists, private equity funds, family offices, institutional investors and large public companies. \n\nFernando de Leon, founder of Leon Capital Group, started a small lot development company in 2004 with $100,000 and turned it into a $10 billion business, focused mainly on commercial real estate. He did that, he says, by predicting distress, watching the source of capital and leaning on his Harvard degree in evolutionary biology.\n\nWhile others lost their shirts in the great financial crisis, De Leon began to make his fortune. He left a job at Goldman Sachs to start his own business and was doing some deals in residential lot development. A year in, he said, he saw some of the early indications from subprime mortgages and overbuilding that this was going to be \"a difficult cycle change.\"\n\n\"We basically said, look, we see things here that are fundamentally unsound. We're going to take these property positions and sell them, and then kind of wait and see what happens,\" De Leon told Property Play.\n\n\"We divested, we brought back some liquidity, and then we sort of waited, and then in 2008 to 2012 we became fixers. We became people that were able to talk to banks, to life insurance companies, to businesses that had loan exposure, and we were able to solve problems for them,\" he said.\n\nDe Leon said he turned around projects that had stalled and become problematic for lenders, experience he now says informed his thinking in the early years of the pandemic.\n\n\"In 2021, we sold a great deal, several billion dollars of real estate because prices were high, and that was a function of low interest rates and euphoria and bad incentives in the market,\" he said. \"Part of it is understanding where the capital is coming from. You begin to see participants in the market that shouldn't be there ... and when they match up and that funnels through the supply chain, you begin to see distortion and pricing.\"\n\nNow, De Leon said, he's seeing the same red flags flying over data centers.\n\nWhile big players like Blackstone, KKR and Bain Capital are buying in, De Leon said he is sitting out.\n\n\"The thing that I can't quite square is the data center play. I look at a data center that's $10 billion, right? First of all, there haven't been any exits above, you know, $4 billion or $5 billion, you haven't seen comps, so that worries me quite a bit,\" he said.\n\n\"Then I see large technology companies, the largest companies on the planet, with $4 trillion market cap, saying, 'I don't want to own this asset. I don't want to have this on my balance sheet.' So I ask, Why? Why doesn't the largest company in the world want to own its own asset?\" De Leon said. \"The AI business is everything for them today, for the large hyperscalers, and so they're saying, 'No, you build it, you finance it.'\"\n\nDe Leon surmises that what is inside these data centers, the technology of artificial intelligence, will quickly become obsolete. AI, after all, is designed to make everything more efficient, including itself. And the value of the centers is not the four walls, but what's inside.\n\nThese 15- and 20-year leases that developers are relying on, he suspects, are \"Swiss cheese\" leases — as in, full of holes in the agreement over time.\n\nDe Leon said his biggest concern is that big private capital investors are getting the money they manage from things like pension funds for teachers, police and firefighters.\n\n\"When they say, 'I'm going to own this asset and lease it back to one of the hyperscalers,' they're putting other people's money at risk,\" he said.\n\nDe Leon started in the real estate business as a teenager, working as a translator for a local Texas developer. Instead of getting a salary, he asked for equity in a project. And rather than getting a degree in business, he chose evolutionary biology, because understanding people is good business, he says.\n\n\"It was prescient. I mean, it turned out to help me make decisions about organizing companies and leadership, building businesses,\" De Leon said. \"I think some of these things are about incentives, right? Basic commercial interaction between human beings is about incentives.\"\n\nHe said that's particularly true in industries where there are well-established players.\n\n\"You always find a status quo group of incumbents that are set up, and they have certain advantages,\" he said. \"Understanding them from a sociological standpoint, that gave us some insight into saying, 'OK, this business should compete on this basis. This is where we can win,' kind of seeing around the corners.\"\n\nDe Leon said he's excited about how much more capital is coming in to commercial real estate — from wealth firms, family offices, sovereign wealth funds and pensions.\n\n\"When the allocations to real estate go from 3% to 6%, that number means that there's like $4 trillion more of capital that is chasing a finite number of real estate assets,\" he said. \"When that happens, you see an oversupply of capital, you'll see price appreciation for fundamentally sound real estate assets. And so I think the story of the next 10 years will be that the real estate capital markets will grow tenfold.\"",

    "description": "2026 should kick off a long-term process of housing market normalization, with small improvements in affordability.",
    "fullText": "For more than three years, it’s been dismal to be a homebuyer. But in 2026, things might get just a little easier.\n\nHousing affordability is poised to improve next year as mortgage rates decrease slightly and home price appreciation slows down. Those conditions — provided they hold — could bring more buyers and sellers off the sidelines and into the market during the traditional busy spring homebuying season, and help home sales notch their first significant gain since they plunged in 2023 to levels not seen since the mid-1990s.\n\nUltimately, affordability improvements next year are likely to be the first step in a longer period of market normalization, economists and experts who spoke to Yahoo Finance say. Given just how aggressively prices and mortgage rates have risen in recent years, many buyers will remain shut out of the market.\n\n“It’s really only the start of a long process,” said Chen Zhao, head of economics research at the brokerage Redfin. “For a lot of people, they’re still not necessarily going to be able to get into the housing market.”\n\nWhen many people think of scenarios that would make homes more affordable, what often comes to mind is events like the global financial crisis, which sent US home prices down an average of 27% between 2006 and 2012.\n\nWhile it’s possible that home prices fall slightly on average next year, few housing experts expect a crash because the country still has a shortage of homes.\n\nInstead, most affordability gains will likely come via slightly lower mortgage rates and a pace of home price appreciation that drops below average wage growth.\n\nMany economists forecast only modest home price gains of 1% to 3% next year. That gives incomes, which have been rising in the 3% to 4% range annually, a chance at outpacing home price appreciation for the first time in years. Home prices are also falling in some markets, particularly in parts of the Southeast and the Mountain West.\n\nLower mortgage rates would also help affordability, and are a real possibility. Rates have been hovering around 6.2% in recent months, and many economists expect them to average somewhere in the low 6% range next year. That’s down from this year’s average of about 6.6%.\n\n“Across the year, there will be an improvement,” said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. “We expect monthly payments to be a little bit lower for the first time in five years.”\n\nEven relatively small drops in mortgage rates can translate to meaningful changes in monthly payments. A homeowner with a $320,000 mortgage at 6.8% — where rates were at the beginning of the year — would pay about $2,086 toward their loan each month. At 6.2% — where rates are now — they’d pay $1,960.",

    "fullText": "Brick-and-mortar business has long been the foundation of real estate — figuratively and literally. But as the industry adapts to new technologies and rapidly changing market conditions, new leaders are stepping in to meet unique new challenges.\n\nEach year, Business Insider highlights up-and-coming agents, architects, founders, and other figures making an outsize impact in real estate. The process starts with nominations from CEOs, company presidents, and managing partners. To be considered, nominees must be US-based, under 40, and stand out from their peers. Business Insider's editors make the final selections.\n\nThis year's class of rising stars comes from a wide array of backgrounds, with prior expertise in everything from construction and marketing to private equity. From making real estate investing more attainable to developing 500-square-foot homes to fit in your backyard, they're addressing some of the industry's biggest challenges head-on.\n\nMeet Business Insider's 18 Rising Stars of Real Estate for 2025.\n\nTarek Afifi said his secret to success is his deep belief in the American dream.\n\nThe 28-year-old, who serves as the corporate finance and investor relations manager at Better Home & Finance, said he gets satisfaction from shaping investors' perception of the online mortgage lender — and helping the company's hard work get reflected in its stock price.\n\nHe attributes his success to how deeply he believes in Better's mission, and said the idea of helping Americans buy a home brings him satisfaction.\n\n\"Everyone wants to own equity in a home that they can live in, but also, build wealth off of,\" he said. \"What really attracted me to it, I think, is the fact that it really is applicable to all walks of life,\" he said of buying a home.\n\nBetter shares have soared more than 400% since April of last year, around the time Afifi joined the company. That's due to investor optimism on the company's future earnings growth, as well as a surge of interest in the stock after the hedge funder Eric Jackson made a high-profile bet on the company.\n\nBetter reported a net loss of $27 million in the second quarter, down from a $40 million net loss in the first quarter. Its funded loan volume for the quarter also rose to $1.2 billion, up 38% for the quarter.\n\nAfifi is optimistic about the direction of the residential real estate market over the next year. He expects refinance and mortgage activity to bloom in 2026 as the Fed continues to cut interest rates.\n\n\"Everyone's kind of positioning themselves for the refi rally,\" he said. \"So it's a symbiotic relationship and I think that it's something we're all looking forward to seeing.\"\n\nThe rate of Hispanic homeownership rose to a record 49.5% in 2023. Maria Barrios wants to make that statistic even higher.\n\nAs the executive director of operations and chief financial officer of the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals (NAHREP), Barrios is central to the nonprofit's mission to promote homeownership and expand access to credit in the Hispanic community through education and advocacy. As of 2025, the organization has 85 chapters nationwide, with an additional 30 in development and nearly 58,000 active members.\n\n\"While our mission is to promote sustainable Hispanic homeownership, we're about much more than that,\" Barrios told Business Insider. \"We understand that homeownership isn't the end goal for Hispanics; it's just the beginning of their financial journey.\"\n\nBarrios has played a key role in expanding the organization's reach, assisting with the launch of the AVANCE Global Conference, a business and media platform, and expanding internationally with AVANCE España in January 2026. She also supported the launch of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance (NHCA) and AVANCE Sports.\n\nOverall, Barrios has driven consistent 30% year-over-year revenue growth for the organization and helped launch an average of 10 new NAHREP chapters annually.\n\n\"The real estate industry faced a challenging market this year, but our biggest accomplishment was growing despite these difficulties,\" Barrios said.\n\nDerek Fitzgerald is the poster child for company loyalty. He's been at McCarthy, a national commercial construction company, since he left college 12 years ago, climbing the ranks to become the senior vice president of operations for the builder's San Francisco office.\n\nIt's a career he came to after finding a passion for the \"built environment\" while studying civil and environmental engineering at UC Berkeley.\n\nSince then, Fitzgerald has been part of a wide range of projects, from the renovation of a 350,000-square-foot naval hangar to the construction of a lab that produced the antiviral drug Remdesivir. The work is varied, and marries his varied set of skills.\n\n\"I didn't necessarily want to focus on the design part of it,\" Fitzgerald said. \"But I found this commercial real estate and construction environment that allowed me to merge my technical background with this passion that I have for people and bringing people together.\"\n\nFor most founders, selling their company marks the end of a journey. For Nick Friedman, it was the beginning of another chapter.\n\nFriedman's first chapter began at 19, when he dropped out of Williams College and set out to start a company that would \"change the world.\" After joining the famed Y Combinator program with Adam Pollack, the two launched lending startup Accept.inc in 2019. In 2022, they sold the company to the real estate technology company HomeLight.\n\nA lot of founders would've ridden into the sunset. Friedman stayed on board.\n\n\"I think that I told the CEO of HomeLight, 'I'm probably going to be your worst employee of all time,'\" Friedman told Business Insider. \"I am not going to listen to you. I'm going to want to do my own thing. I'm going to want to figure out how to grow this thing on my own. That's just who I am. And I don't think I'm going to last very long.\"\n\nThree years later, he's HomeLight's president of home equity, overseeing sales, operations, products, and compliance with everything associated with HomeLight's core lending product, Buy Before You Sell, which allows users to purchase their next home before selling their existing one.\n\nFriedman describes himself as an old soul, and said his willingness to get out and talk to people — instead of relying on social media or sending emails — has helped him connect with the right people and grow his career.\n\n\"We're not shy,\" he said. \"I think the reason a lot of younger founders today don't make it is because they are very shy.\"\n\nReal estate investment is often considered the easiest way to gain wealth in the US. But high barriers to entry prevent unseasoned investors or people with less capital from getting started.\n\nFractional real-estate investing, which allows people to invest in a portion of property instead of buying it outright, makes it easier for non-accredited investors to get started — a fact Mogul Club cofounder Joey Gumataotao recognized early on.\n\n\"My partner and I actually purchased our home right out of college with what very, very little savings we had from jobs that we worked in college and ended up renting out two of our bedrooms to two of my colleagues at Goldman,\" Gumataotao told BI. \"This is a real way to build wealth that wasn't there before.\"\n\nGumataotao started Mogul Club in 2022 alongside his cofounder Alex Blackwood, who he met while they were both working at Goldman Sachs. Blackwood was on the investment banking side, and Gumataotao was in real-estate investing on the private equity side.\n\nThey both wanted to make real-estate investing more accessible to everyone.\n\n\"Even as someone who was working for a large institution, I actually didn't have a ton of opportunity to invest in these lucrative multifamily, large multimillion-dollar investments myself,\" Gumataotao said.\n\nMogul Club allows investors from all financial backgrounds to invest as little as $250 toward a property in markets like Mesa, Arizona, or Ramsey, New Jersey.\n\nAs COO, Gumataotao still handles people management and fundraising responsibilities — Mogul Club is still in its seed-extension round — but he also gets his hands dirty working on the acquisition and supply side of the business.\n\n\"No matter how much we grow, I'll always prefer to be hands-on,\" he said. \"Real estate's my passion.\"\n\nZoe Heyman's role at Basis defies a simple job description. As vice president of investor relations at Basis, a commercial real estate investment firm, the 31-year-old oversees all marketing and investor communications, leads the publication of the company's annual Corporate Responsibility Report, and recently spearheaded the implementation of new technology to better track deals and streamline operations across the company.\n\nHer efforts aren't solely focused on the company's bottom line. As a leader on the People, Planet, Policy Committee, Heyman also organizes environmental-justice fundraisers and community cleanup activities for the firm's employees. Through her involvement in Basis' Capital Connect Initiative, Heyman also works to promote minority-led institutions and direct capital to underserved communities.\n\n\"Zoe Heyman brings a fresh perspective, a modern approach, and an unparalleled level of resourcefulness and initiative to her leadership role,\" said Leigh Roumila, head of investor relations at Basis.\n\nOnly two-and-a-half years into working in residential real estate, Jed Miciak knows it's his calling.\n\nMiciak is the senior vice president of marketing and revenue at Landing, a company that provides a collection of furnished apartments for shorter-term rentals. It's a job with some similarities to the decade he spent working at Hilton, where he helped grow the data analytics team and worked in global pricing.\n\nThis year, Miciak has helped grow Landing's portfolio of properties to about 500 nationally, up from 100 last year. He's also built AI models that use machine learning to identify potential problems, launched Landing's rebrand, and grown the company's online travel agency business while working with companies like Airbnb and Marriott.\n\nOver the next year, Miciak hopes to continue to grow supply and drive marketing efficiency higher — in addition to working toward an IPO down the line. He's motivated by all he's learned from being in the room with longtime real estate pros.\n\n\"I was able to be in these rooms with executives who have been in the space for a long time,\" Miciak said. \"I sat there and provided data at the time; it didn't really seem that valuable for my career. Now, looking back, seeing how these executives face the tough problems solves a lot of the issues running this global powerhouse. It's super helpful.\"\n\nJames Murray is tackling one of architecture's most challenging tasks: designing small spaces that are functional and stylish.\n\nMurray is the director of design at Samara, a modular startup spun out of Airbnb's research and development team. The California-based company's first product, Backyard, is an accessory dwelling unit, or ADU — a compact backyard home that can serve as an in-law suite, home office, or short-term rental.\n\nSamara is growing at a pivotal moment in real estate, as high housing costs prompt many homeowners across the country to stay put and find creative ways to expand their living space.\n\n\"ADU is an acronym that's been spreading across the US for some time, but in California specifically, it's become a very common type of home, one that's now almost ubiquitous as a solution for many people,\" Murray told Business Insider.\n\nSamara offers a suite of backyard ADUs, ranging from compact studios to XL models, measuring between 420 and 950 square feet. For each design, Murray applies a philosophy he calls \"empathetic affordances\" — the idea of creating spaces that respond to how people actually live and move through them.\n\n\"We're always aware of how we engage in a space,\" Murray said. \"Think about the size of a dining table or a bed in a bedroom. It's also about the right balance of space in that perfect kitchen triangle, where you can cook a meal while staying close to the refrigerator, stovetop, and sink.\"\n\nMurray's thoughtful designs have been integral to the company's success, helping Samara book more than $100 million in project value in California over the past year.\n\nWith the abundance of TikToks and Instagram Reels showcasing listings and giving homeownership advice, it's not hard to see the connection between real estate professionals and content creators today.\n\nBut when Griffin O'Brien launched his real-estate media company Estate Media in 2023, it took some time to convince others it was a good idea for a business.\n\n\"There was absolutely a challenge from day one,\" O'Brien told Business Insider of convincing major realtors and talent that being featured in Estate's content would be good for their brands and businesses.\n\nO'Brien, whose background in media spans consulting for Snapchat and working in content acquisition at Roku and Amazon's Prime Video, founded Estate Media with Andrew Shanfeld and \"Million Dollar Listing\" star Josh Flagg as a consulting firm, talent agency, and content-creation machine with a talent-focused approach to creating original content for the real estate industry.\n\nO'Brien said that Estate Media reaches close to 35 million people through its podcasts, newsletters, and shows on a number of social media platforms.\n\n\"We really did see an opportunity between the traditional publications — largely news-based publications — covering real estate and reality television to create content right around these leading voices,\" O'Brien said.\n\nMichael O'Connor has worked nonstop in real estate since he was 21. He has no intentions of changing that.\n\nO'Connor started in luxury real estate with Douglas Elliman, where he's been for nearly a decade. Now a sales associate for The Exclusive Group, a boutique real estate advisory group under Douglas Elliman, O'Connor specializes in South Florida luxury real estate, selling over $1 billion in properties alongside his business partner Nicholas Malinosky. The group was ranked number one in Florida and number two in the country for sales volume for medium-sized teams by The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\"That right there goes to show how hard we work for our clients and production,\" O'Connor said. \"That's definitely the greatest accomplishment over any one particular sale.\"\n\nOne of O'Connor's proudest transactions was for two contiguous oceanfront lots in Delray Beach that sold for a combined $44 million. He and Malinosky have done about 30 transactions a year, though they prioritize sales volume.\n\nBecause many of the buyers and sellers O'Connor works with are \"extremely sophisticated\" and \"typically the best at what they do,\" they want someone who will go above and beyond in guiding them through the process.\n\n\"T​​he phone is always going and you're always getting emails, so it starts early and it goes late,\" O'Connor said.\n\nThere was a time when Alex Redfearn thought things wouldn't work out.\n\nIn 2014, at the age of 25, he launched Redfearn Capital, a private equity firm specializing in commercial real estate, based in South Florida. At the time, he had no experience beyond a college case study he completed at his alma mater, the University of Miami.\n\nRedfearn told Business Insider that during the early years of building his business, he often considered walking away and starting over.\n\n\"I almost quit after the third year,\" he said. \"I tried to, but my wife wouldn't let me. I wanted to get a cabin and move to New York, but we stuck it out.\"\n\nTurns out, his wife was right. Since founding the company, Redfearn has built a portfolio exceeding $800 million in assets under management, spanning industrial real estate including small-bay, manufacturing, and logistics warehouses. Despite challenging economic conditions, such as tighter lending standards and higher interest rates, his firm continues to grow. In 2024, the company acquired 13 properties, generating a total revenue of $125 million.\n\nReflecting on his career, Redfearn said his company's success comes down to persistence — a quality he believes is essential for every young real estate entrepreneur.\n\n\"Do what you say you're going to do,\" Redfearn said. \"I think in my line of business, people often commit to something but don't always follow through. Success really comes down to doing what you said you were going to do.\"\n\nAlexis Rivas believed traditional homebuilding methods were outdated and sought to build homes with the same precision, speed, and cost efficiency as vehicles.\n\nSo in 2014, while still in school, Rivas and his fellow Cooper Union classmate Jemuel Joseph co-founded Cover, a prefab homebuilding company. In 2018, they designed and constructed their first accessory dwelling unit (ADU) — a compact, 500-square-foot, customizable backyard home.\n\n\"There's a huge housing shortage in the United States, and the problem is getting worse,\" Rivas told Business Insider. \"Our approach to solving this is by building homes in a factory with the same repeatability, quality, and scale as cars.\"\n\nLos Angeles-based Cover handles the permitting, design, and engineering process for its customers. Like automobile manufacturing, the company produces every component — from framing to doors and windows — on automotive-style production lines in its factory before assembling the home on-site. The production and installation process of their steel homes, which range from 150 to 1,200 square feet, typically takes 1-2 months, depending on size. ​​\n\nIn 2025, Cover expanded into full-size custom homes, and in October, it announced it was nearing completion of a rebuild of a house destroyed in the Pacific Palisades fires.\n\n\"Cover was always more than a backyard home company,\" Rivas said. \"Expanding to full homes feels like our original ambition becoming visible.\"\n\nA rural farm town in Northwest New Jersey might not be where you'd expect to find the architect responsible for some of the most exciting projects on the East Coast. But in Gensler's case, that's where they found JJ Rivers.\n\nRivers, who has already notched 10 years at global architecture firm Gensler at age 34, had an early appreciation for how things are built.\n\n\"I come from a pretty blue-collar family, so I've got a lot of aunts and uncles in different trades,\" Rivers told Business Insider. \"Growing up, I always had my hands on building things, whether it was at my childhood home or at my relative's home.\"\n\nToday, he's a principal and studio director in Gensler's DC office, and he also runs mixed-use development for the Southeast region. He manages a team of about 60 people, so his fingerprints are all over a number of projects on the East Coast, like Under Armour's new global headquarters in Baltimore.\n\nBecause of the diverse differences in architecture up and down the coast, Rivers is always encountering new challenges. Not that he minds.\n\n\"It just provides you different opportunities,\" he said.\n\nA lot has changed since Luke Robinson joined WeWork more than a decade ago, when the coworking firm was in startup mode and had only a handful of buildings.\n\nOverseeing the firm's sales, Robinson helped launch and scale WeWork's enterprise business, a major component of its growth over the years. Later, when COVID-19 and the work-from-home trend upended the commercial real estate market, he also led the charge to help its businesses bounce back in New York.\n\nRobinson told Business Insider that being as transparent as possible with clients during difficult times has been key.\n\n\"We saw all the extremes. We saw people come back immediately. We saw people fully go remote,\" he said of the pandemic. \"We were able to, number one, hopefully provide solutions, but also provide some perspective.\"\n\nRobinson, who is now WeWork's regional president of North America, said the firm's recent restructuring to slash its $4 billion debt has been challenging.\n\n\"Everything, to a degree, is challenging about that process. I really made a huge effort to be extremely transparent with our landlords and our members throughout the whole process.\"\n\nRobinson said he expects the commercial real estate market to pick up steam next year as the RTO push continues, and he's focused on continuing the company's efforts to refresh its properties and widen its offerings to customers.\n\n\"We've talked about return to office for five years at this point,\" he said. \"I feel very confident in saying that this phase over the past year has been by far the strongest.\"\n\nLaunching a small business at 27 during the pandemic would have been a risk for anyone, but Amy Rossetti was confident that the strong relationships she built wouldn't fail her. Now, after celebrating her company's fifth anniversary, she's planning for many more years of success.\n\nRossetti's company, R[AR]E Public Relations, is a boutique agency with a five-person staff that handles the public relations needs of 22 real estate clients. Since launching in Beverly Hills in 2020, the company has opened a New York office, and Rossetti plans to establish a bigger presence in South Florida and potentially international markets in 2026.\n\nThough Rossetti's clientele is mainly focused around the luxury real estate market, R[AR]E has opened its services to all who need them — from architects to investors to startups.\n\n\"I'm really adamant that I think R[AR]E can be and will be, if it's not too bold to say, the No. 1 real estate PR firm in the country within the next five years,\" she said. \"That's what I'm gunning for.\"\n\nErik Rutter cofounded the real estate development firm Oak Row Equities with every intention of dividing his efforts between Miami and his hometown of New York City. Almost eight years after the 2018 launch, though, he and his firm remain laser-focused on South Florida.\n\nThat choice has proven to be a winning strategy. With Rutter and his cofounder, David Weitz, at the helm, the company has amassed a $3.9 billion portfolio of office, retail, and multifamily space, luring big-name tenants such as Spotify and Amazon along the way.\n\nRutter, 33, started the company with the firm belief that South Florida's quality of life would eventually draw a wave of top employers, who in turn would demand top-tier office space and ample housing for their workers. The COVID-19 pandemic \"certainly accelerated our thesis,\" Rutter said, but he still sees plenty of runway.\n\n\"We're continuing to see great firms take large swaths of space in the Miami market,\" Rutter said. \"And that's not really slowing down.\"\n\nErica Sachse was on a founding spree early in her career.\n\nAfter spending five years in Australia, Sachse noticed that the US real estate market was lagging in its adoption of technology. She set out to fix that.\n\n\"Australia is very far ahead in the utilization of technology and 21st-century marketing techniques for real estate,\" she said. \"I learned how to harness the data being created in the digital space for high-quality lead generation, ultra-targeted campaigns, lead nurture, really strong automation, and data profiling for prospective buyers and renters.\"\n\nShe founded the property marketing company Snaplistings at the end of 2019, then started her own marketing and sales brokerage, Powered by DMT, in 2021.\n\nBeing ahead of the curve has its benefits.\n\n\"Our clients are just so happy to finally be able to make data-driven decisions,\" Sachse said. \"That's really what our focus is and what my passion is.\"\n\nRaised in Paraguay, Sofia Zavala developed an early passion for art and design, as well as a clear sense of their socioecological impact on daily life. This perspective now guides her architectural work.\n\nZavala specializes in large-scale urban projects, and her portfolio encompasses a range of interior corporate work in New York, as well as mixed-use, corporate, and commercial developments across San Francisco and Texas.\n\n\"Large-scale projects have a big impact on the cities they're in,\" Zavala told Business Insider. \"I'm involved in a couple of projects in San Francisco and in Texas, and they're all meant to make a meaningful difference in communities and create beautiful spaces for people to engage.\"\n\nZavala is currently a senior associate at Connecticut-based Pickard Chilton. She's the architectural firm's youngest employee at that rank and the youngest woman on its senior leadership team.\n\n\"I'm very proud of that and grateful for the confidence that the firm has placed in me,\" Zavala said. \"Being in this role motivates me to keep raising the bar and to support younger designers as they grow into leadership roles and find their own voice.\"\n\nZavala has plenty to be proud of. In 2024, she was a project designer on 530 Howard, an 840-foot luxury residential tower in San Francisco — the city's largest residential building. In 2025, she will also serve as the design team leader for the recently announced Ritz-Carlton Houston, which is projected to be the downtown area's second-tallest building at more than 600 feet.\n\n\"The most rewarding part of my job is knowing that the projects we do at Pickard Chilton aren't just buildings — they're future landmarks that help shape the skyline,\" Zavala said. \"That's the really exciting part of what I do here.\"",
