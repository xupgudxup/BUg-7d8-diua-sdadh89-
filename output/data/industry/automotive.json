    "fullText": "The car market can often defy logic. As we are aware, buying used saves money in general, as new cars lose a potential 30% of their value within two years. Yet, this isn't always the case: some used models often sell for above the MSRP of their newer rivals.\n\nIt doesn't make sense, but there are reasons for this. For instance, inventory may have been disrupted by market events, such as the 2022 semiconductor shortage. Moreover, when demand outstrips supply, certain vehicles become more desirable, which only drives wider interest.\n\nWhich cars make the grade for this unique selection? Using the latest iSeeCars listings data, among other sources, we have compiled this fleet of stalwarts. As you can probably guess, Toyota is quite the overperformer.\n\nIf you're looking for a new car to get you from point A to B and back, these might be worth considering.\n\nThe Ford Maverick boasts a hybrid powertrain option that can deliver strong fuel economy and a modest tow rating that still handles everyday tasks. As a selling point, it is one of the few pickups appealing broadly from daily commute to weekend jobs. This used car has an astonishingly high price difference over a new model: around 12.3% and an average $4,038 increase.\n\nMoreover, its smaller footprint makes city parking easier, and standard features like smartphone integration and a comfortable cabin extend its value on the used market. It is clearly a very popular used car choice. According to Drew Dorian at Car and Driver, the Maverick is \"a simple, honest truck with enough capability for casual truck drivers who don't need something the size of an F-150.\"\n\nToyota's Corolla Hybrid has quietly become one of the most efficient compact sedans/SUV alternatives on the road. Of course, it is just one reason why used examples can fetch prices well above their new counterparts in recent listings.\n\nIn its 2026 review, Car and Driver observed that the Corolla Hybrid can deliver fuel economy into the 50+ mpg range. Such an irresistible economy makes it stand out among compact vehicles, where efficiency and cost rule the roost. That blend of everyday thrift and strong reliability has translated into strong demand for lightly used units. It goes without saying that Toyota's hybrid technology has decades of consistent performance under its belt, which translates to trust in the used market.\n\nLike its Japanese rival, Toyota, Mercedes has already convinced us how much we can trust them. The company's reputation for durability means buying used comes with few doubts. The Mercedes-Benz G-Class is no exception and arguably the premier example of a luxury SUV whose used pricing often exceeds new MSRP on dealership listings.\n\nThis outcome is particularly true for low-mileage AMG variants. The G-Class blends classic design with formidable off-road capability and premium amenities that appeal to enthusiasts and luxury buyers alike. According to Edmunds' appraisal data, a 2024/2025 G-Class can still command dealer retail values well into the high five figures and beyond.\n\nMinivans usually depreciate faster than SUVs, so the Toyota Sienna is in a league of its own, and not just for this unique trait. For starters, it's one of the few modern minivans that never got replaced by SUVs, instead evolving into a hybrid-only platform that's both fuel-thrifty and family-friendly.\n\nThat reputation for practicality, combined with strong reliability, has led to very tight used-car inventories, keeping prices close to or above new MSRP in many markets.\n\nIn its 2025 coverage, MotorTrend's Bob Hernandez called the Sienna \"one of the most enduring people movers in North America,\" noting its efficient hybrid powertrain, generous interior space, and thoughtful tech upgrades, including larger infotainment screens and refined connectivity features.\n\nThe Toyota RAV4 Prime is the plug-in hybrid version of America's perennial SUV bestseller. This trusty little SUV is one of the models that still shows used pricing above new MSRP in the latest iSeeCars research. It's a reflection of the RAV4 Prime's demand among buyers who want both electric range and SUV utility.\n\nDrew Hardesty of the YouTube channel Car Confections cites the 2024 Prime as his all-around favorite SUV. He says it \"builds upon the already excellent formula of the Rav 4 hybrid and gives you that pure electric range and more performance without compromising really anything.\" The video estimates that a used 2024 RAV4 Prime retains a nice 65% of its resale value after five years, which is why these SUVs are hard to find.\n\nWhile often underrated against bigger siblings, the Toyota Corolla Cross has quietly boomed in popularity. The TCC is a small SUV with a big following and a solid performer in a small package, much like Prince before he departed the stage for good.\n\nIt has held its own so well that used prices have edged above new MSRP in national iSeeCars listings. Built on Toyota's reliable foundation, the Corolla Cross delivers comfortable seating, good visibility, and efficient performance: traits that buyers prize in a small SUV. There is a clear Toyota-shaped pattern emerging here.\n\nOfficially, Toyota's RAV4 is America's favorite SUV, according to AutoBlog's Jacob Oliva. It means that demand is at an all-time high, and inventory is tight. Added to this fact, RAV4s will go hybrid, pushing used demand even further.\n\nNot all used RAV4 Hybrid pricing comes from electrified variants: the standard RAV4 Hybrid also appears above new MSRP in some used listings. Owners can appreciate its smooth ride quality, good fuel economy, and adaptability from suburban roads to light off-road trails: a balance that can appeal to many buyers.\n\nWhile Japan's Toyota is unmatched for long-term auto investment, South Korea is never far behind. Kia's success has been palpable over the past two decades in the USA, and the Carnival's utilitarian design makes it one of the more popular models. With minivans less common than SUVs, buyers seeking maximum space without jumping to larger three-row SUVs have helped keep Carnival prices firm. Furthermore, it has the handling, feature content, and usability rather than sheer economy to promote resilience.\n\nJerry Seiner of Kia South Jordan in Utah reminds us why they are so popular. \"Kia vehicles are built to last, with high-quality materials and engineering designed for longevity,\" he writes. \"This focus on durability means that even older Kia models can perform well and maintain their aesthetic appeal over time.\"\n\nThis off-road icon with huge cult appeal has seen a revival this decade, making it one of Ford's recent success stories. Built on a rugged ladder frame, the Bronco offers multiple trim levels, powerful turbocharged engines, and authentic off-road capability with selectable drive modes designed to conquer terrain from sand to mud.\n\nFor an idea of which models will retain value best, perhaps this Everything Bronco Aftermarket review will enlighten. \"Models such as the Bronco Raptor with the top-spec V6 and the limited edition Ford Bronco Heritage Edition are likely to retain value the best,\" it reads.\n\nIf there's one vehicle that has turned depreciation into something of a practical joke, it's the Toyota Tacoma. This iconic midsize pickup has become America's go-to for reliability and longevity, rugged enough for weekend hauling but compact enough for daily use.\n\nThat reputation for durability and desirability means light-mileage used Tacomas are sometimes priced as high as or higher than new ones: a rare exception to the usual depreciation curve.\n\nKelley Blue Book's (KBB's) \"Best Resale Value Awards\" make clear that the 2025 Toyota Tacoma has a strong 64% resale value. This credential makes it highly in demand across the used car markets.",

    "fullText": "Lando Norris has admitted he described the new Formula 1 cars as \"a lot of fun\" last week to \"see what the reaction was of everyone\".\n\nThe world champion also suggested Max Verstappen, who had said the cars were \"just not F1\", could \"go and find something else to do\" if he did not like them.\n\nOn Thursday, at the second pre-season test, Norris said: \"I just didn't want to come out into the media and complain to everyone on the first weekend back.\n\n\"I just wanted to say that and see what the reaction was of everyone.\n\n\"It's been quite an amusing week, and it certainly made a lot of people comment and say a lot of things.\"\n\n'Just not F1' or 'a lot of fun'? New cars split drivers\n\nHamilton finds new F1 cars 'more fun' to drive\n\nThe McLaren driver also admitted the cars were \"certainly not the purest form of racing\", and he shared Verstappen's views in many ways.\n\n\"I agree with Max on a lot of comments,\" Norris said. \"Probably most of the comments I agree with, but it's not that I don't have fun out there. So there's two sides.\n\n\"I do agree with basically every other driver, because I think every other driver has made their comments pretty clear. I just didn't want to come out into the media and complain to everyone on the first weekend back. I want to still enjoy my time and just say what I feel.\n\n\"I had fun last week. I've still been having fun out there now. And I think we know as a championship with FIA and with Formula 1, we're trying to improve the car that we have now, because it's certainly not the purest form of racing, and that's what Formula 1 should be.\n\n\"A lot of the driving is focused on just trying to get the battery to work properly and less focused on how can you as a driver get everything out of the car.\"\n\nVerstappen's criticisms centred on the amount of energy management that is required with the new cars.\n\nThe combination of the power provided by the electrical part of the engine being increased three-fold, to about half of the total output, and the batteries being more or less the same size, has led to drivers doing tasks they have described as counter-intuitive.\n\nThese include not coming out of the corner before a qualifying lap as fast as possible, lifting and coasting on the straights on qualifying laps, and backing off before the end of a qualifying lap, all strategies aimed at the optimum use of energy and best overall lap time.\n\nThis has led to continuing discussions behind the scenes about tweaks to the rules before or after the start of the season, when the regulations governing engines are already complicated as a consequence of the way the engines perform.\n\nA number of drivers have also expressed concern about the potential difficulty of overtaking as the former DRS overtaking aid has been replaced by a \"boost\" button giving a burst of extra electrical energy, which is proving less effective so far.\n\nWilliams driver Carlos Sainz, a director of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association, said: \"My message to [commercial rights holder] FOM and FIA is [at] the start of the year we need to stay a bit open-minded in case the regulations that we've come up with are maybe a bit exaggerated on the amount of harvesting or deployment that we have to do through a lap.\n\n\"It might make some circuits OK, like potentially here, even though I still think here is not fully OK with what we're seeing so far.\n\n\"But tracks like Melbourne or potentially Jeddah, tracks that might be more energy-demanding, we might need to adjust a bit the regulations.\n\n\"It is not easy because it's such a big change that I don't think anyone knew how to predict how much downforce/drag the car was going to have and what level of deployment the teams would come up with. We should stay flexible rather than committed to a certain level of energy management.\"\n\nOn the penultimate day of pre-season testing, Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli set the fastest time by 0.058 seconds from the McLaren of Oscar Piastri.\n\nFerrari turned heads by trying out a rear wing that had its upper element turn upside down when the car's straight-line mode was activated.\n\nStraight-line mode is a new feature this year in which both front and rear wings open on the straights to increase speed and increase energy recovery possibilities.\n\nNormally the rear wing flap simply moves to open a gap between it and the wing mainplane. Ferrari's is an innovation never seen before.\n\nThe team described the wing as a test item and it was seen only briefly before what Ferrari said was an unrelated \"banal\" technical problem stopped the car.\n\nHamilton managed only five laps before the lunch break, and returned to the track in the second four-hour session to complete 78 laps for the day - compared to Verstappen's 139 as one of the few other drivers who took part in both sessions - and set the fourth-fastest time.\n\nHeadline lap times in testing are unreliable indicators of form and the general opinion is the top four teams - Mercedes, Ferrari, Red Bull and McLaren - are clear of the rest, with Mercedes viewed by most as in the best shape at this stage.\n\nAston Martin were another team to have reliability problems. Fernando Alonso stopped on track with a problem with his Honda engine and did not get out again for the final two hours or so of the day.\n\nThe team are struggling with an uncompetitive, overweight car and an underpowered engine and Alonso was 4.669secs off the pace.\n\nPractice starts performed at the end of each session to assuage concerns about the difficulty of preparing the new engines for launching off the line seemed to show Ferrari-engined cars may have a significant advantage at the start of the race.\n\nFastest times, day two, final pre-season test, Bahrain\n\n1 Kimi Antonelli (Ita) Mercedes one minute 32.803 seconds\n\n2 Oscar Piastri (Aus) McLaren +0.058\n\n3 Max Verstappen (Ned) Red Bull +0.359\n\n4 Lewis Hamilton (GB) Ferrari +0.605\n\n5 Lando Norris (GB) McLaren +0.650\n\n6 Franco Colapinto (Arg) Alpine +1.015\n\n7 Nico Hülkenberg (Ger) Audi +1.184\n\n8 George Russell (GB) Mercedes +1.308\n\n9 Esteban Ocon (Fra) Haas +1.398\n\n10 Liam Lawson (NZ) Racing Bulls +1.729\n\n11 Alex Albon (Tha) Williams +1.752\n\n12 Gabriel Bortoleto (Brz) Audi +2.460\n\n13 Oliver Bearman (GB) Haas +2.476\n\n14 Sergio Pérez (Mex) Cadillac +2.566\n\n15 Fernando Alonso (Spa) +4.699\n\n16 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Cadillac +7.390",

    "fullText": "Liam Lawson has been cautioned that the new 2026 Formula 1 cars might bring to light a weakness in his game this season.\n\nThe Racing Bulls haven’t had a standout pre-season so far, but Arvid Lindblad did manage to put in more laps than anyone else during Wednesday’s morning session.\n\nHe handed over driving duties to Liam Lawson for the afternoon as both drivers get ready for the season opener in Australia.\n\nJack Doohan, watching from trackside in Bahrain, noticed something in the Racing Bulls setup that could be an issue going forward. Still, team principal Alan Permane will hope there’s enough time to address any problems with the VCARB 03 before racing gets underway.\n\nMeanwhile, commentator and journalist Nelson Valkenburg believes a familiar problem could return for Lawson. He suggested that issues from his short spell at Red Bull might reappear this year with the new regulations:\n\nValkenburg spoke about Racing Bulls’ performance during an appearance on the Nailing the Apex Podcast and said: “Yes, it felt very uninterested in headline lap times, but they had some performance niggles and some engine problems and hydraulics.\n\n“I don’t know, where the foundation of the Red Bull feels incredibly strong and stable, less so for the Racing Bulls team, but we can put them in this similar category [to Audi]. Could be fifth, could be eighth.\n\n“I’m becoming a fan of Lindblad. When I spoke to him, he didn’t look shell-shocked, and that’s a good place to be after your first few test days.\n\n“For Lawson, I worry a bit simply because we’ve learned over these days that there is a way of going fast into corners that makes the car a little tail happy.\n\n“Which is probably a nightmare scenario for Liam Lawson, considering what we saw at Red Bull last year.\n\n“You go through the gears, your weight transfers to the front, you do a lot of engine braking and the car. You have to hang on to the rear as you turn into the corner; basically Max’s dream right?”\n\nWhile there are certainly areas for concern when it comes to Racing Bulls’ chances this season based on what has been seen during pre-season testing so far in Bahrain. However they’ll hope that they still have time before things get going for real against McLaren in Australia next month.\n\nWhile the early feedback on the new regulations hasn’t been overwhelmingly positive for Lawson, he’s still young enough to develop the skills needed to thrive under these conditions.\n\nRacing Bulls clearly believe in his potential – they wouldn’t have chosen him over Yuki Tsunoda if they didn’t think he could be a strong partner for Lindblad.\n\nOn the first day of Bahrain’s second week of testing, Lawson finished 12th, seven places ahead of Lindblad.\n\nThe times don’t hold much weight at this point in the season, but it’s still a small boost for Lawson as he heads into the final stretch of pre-season preparations.\n\nFerrari’s F1 car struggles with Verstappen’s high-revs downshift trick during Bahrain test\n\nCarlos Alcaraz says what he thinks about Formula 1 after watching Bahrain test\n\nAnthony Davidson accuses Fernando Alonso of ‘burning up’ tyres in Aston Martin during F1 testing",

    "title": "5 Brands That Make The Worst Cars, According To Consumer Reports",
    "description": "If you are in the market for a new car, there are a few car brands that are best avoided. Here are some of them according to Consumer Reports rankings.",
    "fullText": "Every year, it's good to learn which brands make the best cars, the cream of the crop, if you will, so you have a better idea of what to shop for. You can also reasonably discern which brands or models got better from the years prior, and consider which pre-owned models might be worth shopping for in a year or so — given they're getting great scores. Some of those brands include Subaru, BMW, Porsche, Honda, Toyota, Lexus, and Lincoln. But it's also good to know the opposite end of the spectrum: which cars were the worst of the worst.\n\nSituated dead last on the Consumer Reports \"Brands That Make the Best Cars\" list, the 2026 Jeep models are some of the least recommended from the auto experts. With Consumer Reports citing problems with poor fuel economy, lots of in-cabin wind noise, and uncomfortable interiors, they're not as driver and passenger-friendly as one would expect. But what truly takes them down a notch is that the 2026 Jeep models feature poor user reliability scores. That is a collective grade across all models, but it's worth noting if you're thinking about getting one.\n\nOf course, that doesn't mean they're not popular. Jeeps are still some of the best-selling vehicles on the market today. It's a company well-known for its rugged and off-grid models like the Wrangler and Compass. Those who want to take a classier trip can opt for the Wagoneer and Grand Cherokee models. However, don't expect to be as ultra-comfortable as you would when riding in competing models according to CR. It's probably a good time to note Jeep is one of the last in CR's owner satisfaction ratings, as well.\n\nLand Rover earns a spot on the list but may seem like an oddball at first. That's because the brand is known for its luxury vehicles, and Consumer Reports praises its comfortable and spacious interiors, powerful engines, and executive styling that punches up. The problem, it seems, is that the brand has also long been known for frequent breakdowns and costly repairs, and the 2026 models don't do anything to assuage those concerns.\n\nLand Rovers are considered more expensive to maintain and repair because they rely on specialized labor and parts. Moreover, Consumer Affairs reviews list common problems like engine failures or transmission problems, which, as far as vehicle issues go, are some of the more expensive concerns to deal with on both new and used vehicles. That certainly decreases the perceived value of pre-owned Land Rovers — no one wants to buy a like-new vehicle that ends up with serious engine problems.\n\nConsumer Reports does give some praise to GMC's lineup of SUVs and trucks, but also points out that they're basically restyled versions of Chevrolet models with slightly different badges and upgrades. Then again, Chevrolet scored a bit higher in the list, while GMC takes a hit because of its \"below average\" reliability ratings. Another GM brand, Buick, ranks even higher, which makes GMC's ranking all the more unfortunate. GM is one of the best-selling car makers overall, as well, though Chevy was responsible for a lot of that performance.\n\nThat probably won't take the wind out of GMC's sails, however. The GMC Sierra is one of the best-selling American trucks for 2026, and that's despite the brand being consistently listed in the bottom five automakers. For 2026, the brand's crossovers appear to be the biggest reliability offenders, with the Terrain, Acadia, and Canyon receiving lower than average scores. Despite GMC's lower scores, it does have decent owner satisfaction ratings. It may all come down to whether or not the 2026 model features are ideal for your family and lifestyle. GMC only has a handful of exclusive reviews on Consumer Affairs, but they're less than stellar.\n\nOne brand that you might be surprised to see lower on the list is Dodge. Known for its muscular, powerful cars like the Charger and Challenger, in recent years the brand has been siphoning that energy into its cars and SUVs, like the Durango.\n\nAs for why it hasn't earned a higher placement, Consumer Reports cites the brand's consistently low reliability scores, pointing out poor performance in crash tests and road tests and lagging user satisfaction ratings. The Dodge Hornet scores are particularly low, dragging down the brand overall, but there aren't really any other standouts in terms of positive scores, either.\n\nNotably, the Dodge Durango ended 2025 with one of its best quarters in the previous year. It could signal a disconnect between what Consumer Reports says is a bad value vehicle — which aggregates user satisfaction ratings — and what people are willing to spend money on. We'll have to wait until this year's sales numbers are tallied up to see if the Durango is still selling well and if it makes it to the top-selling cars of the year, along with Dodge's additional offerings.\n\nAlfa Romeo seems to follow the same pattern as the other low-scoring brands on the list. Its vehicles are agile, powerful, and fun to drive, according to CR, but also have some lower reliability ratings, which make them a tough recommend for most.\n\nAlfa Romeo is quintessentially an Italian luxury automaker based in Europe. Because of that, the company employs \"unusual details\" that manifest in features and controls which aren't as convenient for modern drivers. Like a B-pillar on the Giulia that gets in the way — the side vertical support pillar protecting the center of the cabin.\n\nThe Tonale and Giulia have lower reliability and user satisfaction scores from the brand. On the flip side, about 95% of reviewers on Kelley Blue Book recommend the Alfa Romeo Stelvio. Many of those reviewers cite loving the vehicle for its unique feel while driving, one-of-a-kind styling, and fun driving experience. That said, there are still plenty of lower scores that question and comment on the brand's reliability.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "fullText": "State regulators walk back suspension threat and say Tesla has stopped misleading drivers about the safety of its cars\n\nTesla will avoid a 30-day suspension of its dealer and manufacturer licenses in California, its biggest market, after the US electric vehicle maker stopped using the term “autopilot” in the marketing of its vehicles in the state.\n\nTesla now uses the term “supervised” in references to its full self-driving technology and has stopped using “autopilot” entirely in its marketing in the state.\n\nState regulators said Tuesday that Tesla had stopped misleading drivers about the safety of its cars, and so the state will not suspend its state sales license for 30 days, as had been threatened.\n\nThe decision by the California department of motor vehicles comes after CEO Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company was found by an administrative law judge last year to have misled drivers about the ability of Tesla cars to drive themselves in its use of the terms “autopilot” and “full self-driving”. In 2022, the DMV had accused Tesla of misleading consumers by using “autopilot” and “full self-driving” for its advanced driver-assistance features.\n\nThe DMV narrowed its focus in December to the term “autopilot” as Tesla revised its use of the term “full self-driving” to clarify that driver supervision is required. “Autopilot” enables Tesla vehicles to accelerate, brake and remain within their lanes on highways. “Full self-driving” allows vehicles to change lanes and respond to traffic signals on city streets.\n\nThe judge had recommended that regulators suspend Tesla’s license to sell cars for 30 days, but the regulators gave the company a 90-day window to make changes. They decided it had done that sufficiently to fix the deceptive marketing.\n\nThe reprieve from the California DMV comes as Tesla and other electric vehicle makers grapple with a plunge in demand after the expiration of key tax credits that had boosted sales. Musk has switched the company’s focus toward robotaxis equipped with self-driving technology, as well as humanoid robots.",

    "fullText": "Lewis Hamilton says he finds this year's Formula 1 cars \"more fun\" to drive - in contrast to Max Verstappen and Fernando Alonso's assessment of the impact of the new rules.\n\nF1 has made the biggest rule change in its history and introduced new regulations for chassis, engines, tyres and fuel.\n\nVerstappen has criticised the amount of energy management required from the new hybrid engines, but Hamilton said he was enjoying the reduced grip of the cars and different aerodynamic philosophy.\n\n\"We just have a less downforce,\" the Ferrari driver said. \"But you still have to discover the grip. There's still so many elements completely under our control.\n\n\"So, it's just different, and new, and I still find it quite fun.\n\n\"The cars are more fun to drive. They're easier to correct. So you have snaps and keep them on track. The previous year's cars were a bit too on edge.\"\n\n'Just not F1' or 'a lot of fun'? New cars split drivers\n\nHiding pace? Too slow? What pre-season testing told us\n\nBut Alonso said that a driver's skill was not as important as before, because optimum energy management meant some corners were taken slower than they could be because doing so gained more lap time from having extra energy to deploy on straights than was lost through the bends.\n\nAlonso said: \"You're always on the limit on the grip. It depends on the corners. You're always on the limit on the grip in a rental car if you push to the limit.\n\n\"But the high-speed corners, especially, I think it's less challenging. You have to say that. There's nothing wrong to say [that].\n\n\"In Turn 12 in Bahrain, and some of the corners maybe in Barcelona, you decide to save energy and go through the corner at a slower speed so you have more energy for the straight.\n\n\"From a driver's point of view the skills matter less because you can go as fast as the energy choice you make before that corner, so it's a different Formula 1.\"\n\nFollowing Verstappen's criticism of the new engines last week, in which he said the new cars were like \"Formula E on steroids\" and \"just not Formula 1\", he said: \"You're fighting the grip. You're on the limit of what you have, for sure. It's just not as much now.\n\n\"Of course, I also know that this probably is one of the worst [circuits], in terms of the grip feeling that you get from a car, because of the tarmac being so aggressive.\n\n\"A lot less downforce but at the same time, you also don't get a lot of combined grip [in the braking and turning phase] at the moment. It's a bit hard to manage.\"\n\nHamilton said he did not yet have a clear picture on how the new rules would affect racing, and said: \"I don't know if it's going to be better.\"\n\nListen to Back at Base on BBC Sounds\n\nOn the first day of the final three-day pre-season test, Mercedes driver George Russell ended up fastest by 0.01 seconds from McLaren's Oscar Piastri.\n\nHeadline times in pre-season testing are notoriously unreliable indicators of actual competitive form, but the word in the paddock at this stage is that Mercedes are still leading the way in the lead-up to the season, with Red Bull, McLaren and Ferrari in close company.\n\nHowever, there is still time for that picture to change over the final two days of the test.\n\nThe troubled Aston Martin team improved after their dire first test last week, with Lance Stroll ending the day 2.5secs off the pace.\n\nHowever, both the car and engine are recognised as being off the pace. But their lead driver Fernando Alonso admitted the team faced a difficult time in the first part of the season.\n\n\"Everything can be fixed, for sure,\" he said, \"short and medium term. I don't think there is anything that is impossible to fix.\n\n\"We will try to fix everything that we can before Australia and after that we try to fix as many things as possible in the first couple of races. Because it's too late in the championship. But I'm optimistic. I think there is a solution in place.\"\n\nThe season starts with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on 6-8 March.\n\nFirst day, final pre-season test, Bahrain\n\n1 George Russell (GB) Mercedes one minute 33.459 seconds\n\n2 Oscar Piastri (Aus) McLaren +0.010\n\n3 Charles Leclerc (Mon) Ferrari +0.280\n\n4 Lando Norris (GB) McLaren +0.593\n\n5 Kimi Antonelli (Ita) Mercedes +0.699\n\n6 Isack Hadjar (Fra) Red Bull +0.801\n\n7 Lewis Hamilton (GB) Ferrari +0.840\n\n8 Carlos Sainz (Spa) Williams +1.654\n\n9 Franco Colapinto (Arg) Alpine +1.795\n\n10 Gabriel Bortoleto (Brz) Audi +1.804\n\n11 Alex Albon (Tha) Williams +2.231\n\n12 Liam Lawson (NZ) Racing Bulls +2.294\n\n13 Pierre Gasly (Fra) Alpine +2.439\n\n14 Lance Stroll (Can) Aston Martin +2.515\n\n15 Esteban Ocon (Fra) Alpine +2.959\n\n16 Fernando Alonso (Spa) Aston Martin +3.077\n\n17 Nico Hülkenberg (Ger) Audi +3.282\n\n18 Arvid Lindblad (GB) Racing Bulls +3.310\n\n19 Oliver Bearman (GB) Haas +3.311\n\n20 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Cadillac +3.787\n\n21 Sergio Pérez (Mex) Cadillac +4.732\n\n*Red Bull's Max Verstappen in the car all day on Thursday",

    "description": "The four-time world champion previously claimed the new F1 regulations are like \"Formula E on steroids\", revealing that he doesn't like driving the 2026 cars",
    "fullText": "Max Verstappen has doubled down on his criticism of the 2026 Formula 1 regulations, stating the championship must “stay away” from becoming Formula E.\n\nThe four-time world champion caused a huge stir during last week’s Bahrain pre-season test, when he labelled the new F1 rule set as “anti-racing” and “Formula E on steroids”.\n\nThis comes as the F1 power unit is now more reliant on electrical energy with a near 50-50 split against the internal combustion engine, meaning battery harvesting will play a greater role at grands prix.\n\nIt may include drivers downshifting on straights to preserve energy, and this is similar to Formula E, where racers often deliberately drop back to save battery before launching late attacks.\n\nVerstappen is against all of this and, when asked on Wednesday if more Formula E drivers may enter F1 because of their experience with battery management, or if the all-electric championship could even become a feeder series, the Red Bull racer said: “Well, let's hope not.\n\n“I mean, not about the drivers, because there are a lot of good drivers that would be able to perform also really well here. But I don't want us to be close to Formula E.\n\n“I want us to actually stay away from that and be Formula 1. So don't increase the battery. Actually, get rid of that and focus on a nice engine and have Formula E as Formula E, because that's what they are about.\n\n“I'm sure that with the new car [Gen4] from what I've seen and talked to some of my friends in there, that's going to be also a really cool car. But let them be Formula E and we should stay Formula 1, and let's try not to mix that.”\n\nVerstappen’s comments are just an example of how the 2026 regulations have divided opinion, as reigning world champion Lando Norris claimed that the new cars are “a lot of fun”.\n\n“I'm just sharing my opinion,” added the Dutchman, when asked if he received any pushback from the authorities over his criticism.\n\n“We live in a free world, free speech and yeah, that's what I felt. Not everyone needs to feel like that, but that's how I felt and it also doesn't matter, of course, what other people have to say about that. It's just I got a question and I shared my opinion.\n\n“I think that I'm allowed to do [that]. So it's not about receiving pushback or whatever.”\n\nRed Bull: Can't make Verstappen happier about 2026 F1 cars, but can build him a winning one\n\nWhat Verstappen means by warning of F1 2026 \"disaster\" to come\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "Jake Paul said that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who he bonded with over \"fast cars,\" taught him to be \"hella productive\" with meetings.",
    "fullText": "Jake Paul was a firebrand YouTuber. Then he was an NFT merchant, and a betting site operator. Now, Paul is a professional boxer — and venture capitalist. And he's learning from one of the biggest names in tech.\n\nOn \"Sourcery,\" Paul said that he met OpenAI CEO Sam Altman while sitting next to each other at President Donald Trump's inauguration.\n\n\"Sam likes fast cars, and so do I,\" Paul said. \"So, we just started talking about cars, and then we got along, and that was really it.\"\n\nPaul's Anti Fund — which is also led by his brother Logan and longtime founder Geoffrey Woo — invested in OpenAI in 2025. The biggest lesson he's learned from Altman is efficiency, Paul said.\n\nHe described the quick-and-tidy meetings that Altman runs. The OpenAI CEO \"walks into the room, sits down, let's get right into the conversation, boom boom boom,\" he said.\n\nIn 15 minutes alone, Altman was \"hella productive,\" Paul said. Then, Altman can go on to his next meeting and do it all over again.\n\n\"We'll do hourlong meetings or calls and just waste time,\" Paul said. \"I think that was inspiring because time is the most valuable thing, and it's the only reason you can't accomplish more.\"\n\nIndeed, Altman has long opted for the 15-minute meeting. In a 2018 blog post, he wrote that the ideal meeting time is either around 15 to 20 minutes or 2 hours, but \"the default of 1 hour is usually wrong.\"\n\nPaul has worked closely with OpenAI in the last year, beyond participating in fundraising.\n\nRemember all of those strange Paul memes running around the internet during the Sora 2 launch? They were by design. Paul said he helped consult on the project and was one of the first to sign over his name, image, and likeness.\n\nWoo also appeared on the podcast, and spelled out the thinking behind those far-out memes (such as an AI Paul declaring he was gay). \"It was not something that was like, 'Hey, Jake Paul is now gay.' Jake was thoughtful in terms of why we were part of that launch.\"\n\nWoo also said that he had formed a good friendship with Altman and Mark Chen, OpenAI's chief research officer.\n\nFor the Sora 2 launch, Paul said that he had \"regular calls\" with OpenAI and offered \"super detailed consulting.\"\n\n\"Me and my brother have however many years combined of social media experience since the beginning,\" Paul said. \"We were there when the term 'influencer' was even made up.\"\n\nThis background, Paul said, helped him give good advice on what OpenAI's social media-like interface should look like. He advised on both what creators and audiences wanted, he said.\n\nAnti Fund closed its $30 million fund in September. Other investments include defense tech startup Anduril and prediction market Polymarket.\n\nWoo said their ties to OpenAI remain strong. \"We were just at OpenAI for three hours looking for other ways to collaborate,\" he said. \"Things might be cooking.\"",

These hidden locations often held ordnance or fuel stockpiles, and Cosmos' fiber-optic drone was armed with explosives to destroy them.\n\nYet inside, the drone rotated its camera to reveal what looked more like a farmer's garage: Four civilian cars, a pair of motorcycles, and two bridled horses.\n\n\"We had not expected to see this. It was unusual,\" Cosmos told Business Insider, speaking on condition that he be identified only by his call sign.\n\n\"We were expecting to find some armored vehicles,\" he added.\n\nVideo of the discovery went viral last week in Ukraine, as the war has increasingly seen Russian soldiers using unconventional transport tools, such as pack animals and bicycles, to conduct assaults or logistics missions. Cosmos said his drone mission was conducted in early February.\n\nThe smaller profile of a horse or civilian car might be harder for a drone to spot, though Russia's repeated use of them has also raised questions about the viability of its tactics and whether it's been producing enough military equipment to sustain its invasion.\n\nCosmos' squad mates and officers at the Wild Division, a first-person-view drone company in the 82nd Air Assault Brigade, had seen clips of Russian soldiers riding on horses to attack Ukrainian positions before.\n\nOne famous example they remember was in Zaporizhzhia, when a Ukrainian drone crew attacked Russian infantry crossing the front lines on horseback last month.\n\nCosmos, who's been piloting drones for a year, said it was the first time he'd personally seen the animals on the front lines.\n\nHe flew his explosive-laden drone straight into the back of one of the cars, and said his crew later struck several other vehicles inside. When Russian troops moved their transport assets, the Wild Division found the next warehouse and attacked that one, too, Cosmos said.\n\n\"The enemy usually lives in hiding close to these places,\" Cosmos said of the warehouse. \"It's common for us to check all targets. Sometimes we can see the enemy infantry, or you can see their vehicles.\"\n\nThe Wild Division declined to say where exactly the warehouse was located, but its brigade is generally deployed in the Donbas.\n\nThe commander of Cosmos' battalion told Business Insider that the discovery of the horses surprised him, too.\n\n\"I thought it had been a location for transport vehicles, sort of a transfer hub,\" said the major, whose call sign is Fizruk.\n\nFizruk said the appearance of horses and cars in his area of the front line could be a sign that Russian forces are running low on standard resources, but also reflects Moscow's attritional nature of fighting.\n\nThe cars discovered by Cosmos appear to be Nivas, inexpensive civilian off-road vehicles from the Russian Lada car brand.\n\n\"They treat these like they will be losses anyway, that they will be destroyed anyway,\" he said. \"Look, a Niva costs, let's say, $2,000. A Hummer, which the Armed Forces of Ukraine uses in many places, costs $20,000, maybe more.\"\n\n\"Since they lose their equipment in assaults, from that point of view, why pay $20,000 for one vehicle if you can buy 10 Nivas for $20,000?\" Fizruk added.\n\nThe Kremlin is known to pressure the front line with repeated ground assaults, sending small groups of infantry to approach Ukrainian positions on foot or in cheap vehicles. The strategy has been costly, with NATO now saying that up to 25,000 Russian troops are dying each month.\n\nSustaining that style of war has pushed Moscow to informal means of recruitment and weapons procurement, including hiring troops from overseas and receiving ammunition from North Korea.",

Sometimes we can see the enemy infantry, or you can see their vehicles.\"\n\nThe Wild Division declined to say where exactly the warehouse was located, but its brigade is generally deployed in the Donbas.\n\nThe commander of Cosmos' battalion told Business Insider that the discovery of the horses surprised him, too.\n\n\"I thought it had been a location for transport vehicles, sort of a transfer hub,\" said the major, whose call sign is Fizruk.\n\nFizruk said the appearance of horses and cars in his area of the front line could be a sign that Russian forces are running low on standard resources, but also reflects Moscow's attritional nature of fighting.\n\nThe cars discovered by Cosmos appear to be Nivas, inexpensive civilian off-road vehicles from the Russian Lada car brand.\n\n\"They treat these like they will be losses anyway, that they will be destroyed anyway,\" he said. \"Look, a Niva costs, let's say, $2,000. A Hummer, which the Armed Forces of Ukraine uses in many places, costs $20,000, maybe more.\"\n\n\"Since they lose their equipment in assaults, from that point of view, why pay $20,000 for one vehicle if you can buy 10 Nivas for $20,000?\" Fizruk added.\n\nThe Kremlin is known to pressure the front line with repeated ground assaults, sending small groups of infantry to approach Ukrainian positions on foot or in cheap vehicles. The strategy has been costly, with NATO now saying that up to 25,000 Russian troops are dying each month.\n\nSustaining that style of war has pushed Moscow to informal means of recruitment and weapons procurement, including hiring troops from overseas and receiving ammunition from North Korea.",

    "fullText": "CAIRO (AP) — The Iranian security agents came at 2 a.m., pulling up in a half-dozen cars outside the home of the Nakhii family. They woke up the sleeping sisters, Nyusha and Mona, and forced them to give the passwords for their phones. Then they took the two away.\n\nThe women were accused of participating in the nationwide protests that shook Iran a week earlier, a friend of the pair told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity for her security as she described the Jan. 16 arrests.\n\nSuch arrests have been happening for weeks following the government crackdown last month that crushed the protests calling for the end of the country’s theocratic rule. Reports of raids on homes and workplaces have come from major cities and rural towns alike, revealing a dragnet that has touched large swaths of Iranian society. University students, doctors, lawyers, teachers, actors, business owners, athletes and filmmakers have been swept up, as well as reformist figures close to President Masoud Pezeshkian.\n\nThey are often held incommunicado for days or weeks and prevented from contacting family members or lawyers, according to activists monitoring the arrests. That has left desperate relatives searching for their loved ones.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has put the number of arrests at more than 50,000. The AP has been unable to verify the figure. Tracking the detainees has been difficult since Iranian authorities imposed an internet blackout, and reports leak out only with difficulty.\n\nOther activist groups outside Iran have also been working to document the sweeps.\n\n“Authorities continue to identify people and detain them,” said Shiva Nazarahari, an organizer with one of those groups, the Committee for Monitoring the Status of Detained Protesters.\n\nSo far, the committee has verified the names of more than 2,200 people who were arrested, using direct reports from families and a network of contacts on the ground. The arrestees include 107 university students, 82 children as young as 13, as well as 19 lawyers and 106 doctors.\n\nNazarahari said authorities have been reviewing municipal street cameras, store surveillance cameras and drone footage to track people who participated in the protests to their homes or places of work, where they are arrested.\n\nThe protests began in late December, triggered by anger over spiraling prices, and quickly spread across the country. They peaked on Jan. 8 and 9, when hundreds of thousands of people in more than 190 cities and towns across the country took to the streets.\n\nSecurity forces responded by unleashing unprecedented violence. The Human Rights Activists News Agency has so far counted more than 7,000 dead and says the true number is far higher. Iran’s government offered its only death toll on Jan. 21, saying 3,117 people were killed. The theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.\n\nGholamhossein Mohseni Ejehi, a hard-line cleric who heads Iran’s judiciary, became the face of the crackdown, labeling protesters “terrorists” and calling for fast-tracked punishments.\n\nSince then, “detentions have been very widespread because it’s like a whole suffocation of society,” said one protester, reached by the AP in Gohardasht, a middle-class area outside the Iranian capital. He said two of his relatives and three of his brother’s friends were killed in the first days of the crackdown, as well as several neighbors. The protester spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by authorities.\n\nThe Nakhii sisters, 25-year-old Nyusha and 37-year-old Mona, were first taken to Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, where they were allowed to contact their parents, their friend said. Later, she said, they were moved to Qarchak, a women’s prison on the outskirts of Tehran where rights groups reported conditions that included overcrowding and lack of hygiene even before the crackdown.\n\nOther people whose arrests were documented by the detainees committee have disappeared into the prisons. The family of Abolfazl Jazbi has not heard from him since his Jan. 15 arrest at a factory in the southern city of Isfahan. Jazbi suffers from a severe blood disorder that requires medication, according to the committee.\n\nAtila Sultanpour, 45, has not been heard from since he was taken from his home in Tehran on Jan. 29 by security agents who beat him severely, according to Dadban, a group of Iranian lawyers based abroad who are also documenting detentions.\n\nAuthorities have also moved to suspend bank accounts, block SIM cards and confiscate the property of protesters' relatives or people who publicly express support for them, said Musa Barzin, an attorney with Dadban, citing reports from families.\n\nIn past crackdowns on protests, authorities sometimes adhered to a veneer of due process and rule of law, but not this time, Barzin said. Authorities are increasingly denying detainees access to legal counsel and often holding them for days or weeks before allowing any phone calls to family. Lawyers representing arrested protesters also have faced court summons and detention, according to Dadban.\n\n“The following of the law is in the worst situation it has ever been,” Barzin said.\n\nDespite the crackdown, many civic groups continue to issue defiant statements.\n\nThe Writers’ Association of Iran, an independent group with a long tradition of dissent, issued a statement describing the protests as an uprising against “47 years of systemic corruption and discrimination.”\n\nIt also announced that two of its members had been detained, including a member of its secretariat.\n\nA national council representing schoolteachers urged families to speak out about detained children and students. “Do not fear the threats of security forces. Refer to independent counsel. Make your children’s names public,” it said in a statement.\n\nA spokesman for the council said Sunday that it has documented the deaths of at least 200 minors who were killed in the crackdown. That figure is up several dozen from the count just days before.\n\n“Every day we tell ourselves this is the last list,” Mohammad Habibi wrote on X. “But the next morning, new names arrive again.”\n\nBar associations and medical groups have also spoken out, including Iran’s state-sanctioned doctors council, which called on authorities to stop harassing medical staff.\n\nAnger over the bloodshed now adds to the bitterness over the economy, which has been hollowed out by decades of sanctions, corruption and mismanagement. The value of the currency has plunged, and inflation has climbed to record levels.\n\nThe Iranian government has announced gestures such as launching a new coupon program for essential goods. Labor and trade groups, including a national retirees syndicate, have issued statements condemning the economic and political crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has moved an aircraft carrier and other military assets to the Persian Gulf and suggested the U.S. could attack Iran over the killing of peaceful demonstrators or if Tehran launches mass executions over the protests. A second American aircraft carrier is on its way to the Mideast.\n\nIran’s theocracy has faced down protests and U.S. threats in the past, and the crackdown showed the iron grip it holds over the country. This week, authorities organized pro-government rallies with hundreds of thousands of people to mark the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nStill, Barzin said, he sees the ferocity of the crackdown as a sign that Iran’s leadership “for the first time is afraid of being overthrown.”\n\nThis story corrects ages for Nyusha and Mona.",

    "fullText": "Four-time world champion Max Verstappen says the new cars in Formula 1 this year are \"not a lot of fun\" and \"like Formula E on steroids\".\n\nThe Red Bull driver says the increased demands for energy management with new hybrid engines are \"just not Formula 1\".\n\nThe new engines are energy starved because of the way the rules have been structured and require several kinds of recovery to ensure the battery has sufficient levels of charge for optimum lap times.\n\nThis is leading to unusual forms of driving, such as not accelerating out of the final corner before a qualifying lap, lifting and coasting to save energy when trying for ultimate performance, and changing down to lower gears in corners for optimum energy harvesting.\n\nAston Martin 'look four seconds off top teams'\n\nVerstappen, whose team have built their own engine for the first time this season, said: \"The right word is management. But on the other hand, I also know how much work has been going on in the background. Also from the engine side, for the guys. So it's not always the nicest thing to say.\n\n\"But I also want to be realistic. As a driver, the feeling is not very Formula 1-like. It feels a bit more like Formula E on steroids.\n\n\"As a pure driver, I enjoy driving flat out. And at the moment, you cannot drive like that. There's a lot going on.\n\n\"A lot of what you do as a driver, in terms of inputs, has a massive effect on the energy side of things.\n\n\"For me, that's just not Formula 1. Maybe it's better to drive Formula E, right? Because that's all about energy efficiency and management. That's what they stand for. Driving-wise, it's not so fun.\"\n\nHe added: \"All the good drivers will be able to adapt to it. That's not the problem, but it's just the whole way of racing is changing, and I would say less pure.\n\n\"I just want normal driving, just how it should be, without having to, 'oh, if I brake a bit longer or less or more, or one gear up or down', you know, stuff like that, that it so heavily impacts the performance on the straights.\"\n\nThe all-electric Formula E series has become known for featuring heavy energy management to ensure cars can get to the end of the races without running out of charge.\n\nF1 is not in the same situation. Rather than a single amount of charge that depletes from maximum to empty from the beginning of the race to the end as in Formula E, the batteries in F1 will go from full charge to very low and back again several times a lap.\n\nBut Verstappen's point is that a lack of energy to run flat out all the time is taking the sport away from its traditional form of driving.\n\nSenior figures in F1 have cautioned against jumping to conclusions about the new rules at such an early stage when everything about the cars is new.\n\nThe biggest regulation change in F1 history has this year seen new rules for chassis, engines, tyres and the introduction of sustainable fuels.\n\nThe engines have a near 50-50 split between the internal combustion and electrical parts and have three times as much electrical power as last year with a battery of more or less the same size.\n\nThere are ways the rules could have been constructed to ensure energy management was not such a feature, for example by slightly reducing the power of the hybrid element and allowing the engines to use more fuel, or even by allowing recovery of energy from the front axle as well as the rear. But none of those have so far been allowed.\n\nOn the chassis side, a straight-line mode has been introduced which reduces drag from the front and rear wings specifically to aid energy recovery. The tyres have been made narrower for the same reasons. And the cars are smaller and lighter and have less grip and downforce.\n\nThe cars recover energy in four ways:\n\nRunning the engine at high revs in corners\n\nLifting off early and coasting at the end of straights\n\nRunning the electrical motor against the engine at 100% throttle\n\nVerstappen is considering competing in the Nurburgring 24 Hours at the famous 14-mile long Nordschleife circuit this year in a GT car - a modified road car.\n\nVerstappen said: \"Looking at it now, at least maybe I can drive flat out there, without looking after my battery. I mean, I want to do it, we are working on it to make it happen, but I cannot confirm it yet.\"\n\nF1 2026 cars in pictures at Bahrain testing\n\nActive aero and overtake mode - F1's new terminology\n\nCadillac unveil split livery in Super Bowl advert\n\nRussell 'wants to go head-to-head' with Verstappen\n\nBarcelona 'shakedown' offers first hints of F1 2026\n\nBiggest rule change ever and Brit teen - what's new in F1 in 2026?",

    "description": "Ford CEO Jim Farley told salaried workers in a town hall meeting that they would be receiving bigger bonuses as initial quality of cars has improved.",
    "fullText": "Ford Motor Co.'s salaried workforce will see their biggest bonuses in years when the company pays them out next month.\n\nFord's white-collar workers will see bigger checks because the Dearborn-based company made substantial strides in meeting key metrics in 2025, especially on improving vehicle initial quality, meaning how good the car performs in the first 90 days of ownership.\n\nThis news comes a day after Ford reported its fourth-quarter and full-year adjusted earnings before interest and taxes plunged compared with the year-ago period, largely due to a fire at its key supplier of aluminum in New York, which disrupted Ford production of profitable pickups and SUVs. Also, Ford paid $2 billion added costs due to President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nOn Feb. 11, during a global town hall, CEO Jim Farley told the salaried workforce that the company surpassed key goals in 2025. Therefore, bonuses for last year, which will be paid at the end of March, will be based on a multiplier of 130%, Ford spokesman David Tovar told the Detroit Free Press.\n\nIt's a substantial bump from recent years. For 2024, for example, the multiplier was just 69% and for 2023 it was 84%, Tovar said.\n\nFord has a global salaried workforce of about 75,000 people. Its salaried bonuses are based on a set of specific metrics in key areas it must meet each year. Tovar listed a few as: adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, quality improvement, global electric vehicle sales and connected services sales.\n\nIf the company meets the metrics, the multiplier is 100%, if it exceeds them it is above 100% and if it falls short it is below 100%.\n\n“This year is above target,” Tovar said. “The quality metric was one of the biggest factors in achieving it because it’s initial quality. We’ve been saying our initial quality scores have been improving.”\n\nFord has struggled with recalls and set an industry record last year with 153 recalls, but those are for older vehicles already on the road and as Farley told the Detroit Free Press last October, initial quality is a better indicator that quality is improving.\n\nIn June, the J.D. Power 2025 U.S. Initial Quality Study, which looks at customers in their first 90 days of ownership, named Ford F-150, F-Series Super Duty, Mustang and Escape best in their segments for initial quality.\n\nFord CFO Sherry House told reporters on Feb. 10 last year the automaker had zero production losses during its vehicle launches due to defects.\n\nThe improvement will likely yield handsome rewards to Farley, too. His compensation is largely based on how well Ford performs and he hits company metrics set by the board of directors. For 2024, he saw his overall compensation drop to $25 million compared with $27 million in 2023, largely due to failing to meet quality improvement goals. Ford will reveal Farley's 2025 compensation in a government filing due out next month.",

He was initially transported to Portsmouth Regional Hospital but has since been flown to a Boston area hospital due to the extent of his injuries, police said in a late-afternoon update.\n\nA passerby in a car called police at 12:22 p.m. to report seeing a bleeding man lying on the ground on the property, according to Deputy Police Chief Michael Maloney.\n\nCrime scene tape was posted around the 1070 Lafayette Road property as city authorities investigated the scene.\n\nPolice did not disclose the man's condition.\n\nLt. Brian Houde stated previously there is no danger to the public associated with the incident. No further information was expected to be released Feb. 11, according to Maloney.\n\nPortsmouth Fire Chief Bill McQuillen deferred comment to city police.\n\nPortsmouth police are continuing to probe the incident.

    "fullText": "(Removes 'downtown' from paragraph 2)\n\nWASHINGTON, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Becky Ringstrom was heading home after following federal immigration officers in her gray Kia SUV in suburban Minneapolis when she was suddenly boxed in by unmarked vehicles. At least a half-dozen masked agents jumped out to arrest her, one knocking on her windshield with a metal object as if threatening to use it to break her window.\n\nAfter the arrest, captured on bystander video verified by Reuters, the 42-year-old mother of seven later said she was transported to Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis where an officer gave her a citation charging her under a ​federal law that criminalizes impeding law enforcement. The official said her name and photo would be added to a government database.\n\nThe arrest of Ringstrom became the latest detention of one of thousands of local activists for violating Title 18, Section 111 of the U.S. Code, a catch-all charge for anyone who “forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes” ‌with a federal officer conducting official duties. The statute can be charged as a felony or misdemeanor. As a felony, it carries up to 20 years in prison, but penalties beyond eight years are reserved for people who use “a deadly or dangerous weapon” or cause an injury.\n\nA Reuters review of federal court records found that the Trump administration has prosecuted at least 655 people under that charge across the U.S. since a series of city-focused immigration crackdowns began last summer. ‌That’s more than double the prosecutions during the same period in 2024-2025, according to a review of publicly available criminal filings in Westlaw, a legal research database owned by Thomson Reuters.\n\nThe charges are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to clamp down on ICE opponents, who they portray as rioters who pose threats to officers and undermine their efforts to arrest immigrants with criminal records.\n\n\"Assaulting and obstructing law enforcement is a felony,\" said U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin. She said federal immigration officers \"used the minimum amount of force necessary to protect themselves, the public, and federal property.\"\n\nICE has been tracking the names of protesters in an internal database for several months, according to two U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss operations.\n\nThe government database contains names, photos, actions that provoked suspicion, locations and license plates, the officials said, adding that the effort was intended to spot patterns that could lead to charges.\n\nDHS said ⁠it does not maintain a database of U.S. “domestic terrorists,” but does track threats. “We do of course monitor and investigate and refer all ‌threats, assaults and obstruction of our officers to the appropriate law enforcement,” McLaughlin said.\n\nOne of the officials said ICE was referring several people per day in Minnesota alone to federal prosecutors for potential charges under the same law for interfering with police operations.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said the Trump administration was committed to protecting First Amendment freedoms, but that people impeding law enforcement \"will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nRingstrom had watched federal immigration officers for about 45 minutes as they sat in a parked car in her neighborhood on Thursday, January 29. When they started to ‍move, she decided to follow along in her SUV, keeping a distance of multiple car lengths behind, she said.\n\nAt a roundabout, a Border Patrol agent approached her car and said, \"Last time I'm going to warn you,\" according to video Ringstrom recorded on her phone.\n\nThe officers went right at a stop sign and she went left, she said. Several minutes later as she started to head back toward her house, multiple vehicles with federal officers stopped and arrested her, she said.\n\n\"I know what I'm doing is not wrong,\" Ringstrom said later in an interview with Reuters.\n\nStill, she said she was terrified when federal officers approached her car. “There was a moment where I thought I could be Renee Good,\" she said, referring to one of the two U.S. citizen protesters fatally shot by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis in January.\n\nAfter her arrest, she was issued a citation, reviewed by Reuters, ​which said the court date was “TBD” - to be determined.\n\nMcLaughlin said Ringstrom \"stalked law enforcement and attempted to obstruct law enforcement from performing their sworn duties.”\n\nSeth Stoughton, a professor focused on policing at University of South Carolina School of Law, said the law in the past mostly has been used to charge assaults on officers and specifically states that the alleged crime must be committed \"forcibly.”\n\n\"Without ‌any physical contact, just following an agent in a car, it's not clear to me that that's resistance or impeding in the first place, and it certainly seems like a stretch to establish that as forcible,\" Stoughton said.\n\nA federal judge in Minneapolis said in a mid-January order that a vehicle following ICE at “an appropriate distance” did not justify a traffic stop or arrest, but that order was paused by an appeals court 10 days later.\n\nThe judge’s now-paused order did not say what exact distance would be deemed safe.\n\nDeborah Fleischaker, a top ICE official under former President Joe Biden, said it was “inappropriate and unconstitutional” to intimidate and arrest people peacefully following immigration officers in their cars.\n\n“Observing ICE activities is not a crime and should not be treated as such,” she said.\n\nMcLaughlin said U.S. Border Patrol agents at the scene gave Ringstrom \"lawful commands and warnings\" but that she continued to obstruct operations, leading to her arrest.\n\n\"When agitators willingly involve themselves and inject themselves in law enforcement operations, they are risking arrest as well as jeopardizing the safety of themselves and those around them,\" McLaughlin said.\n\nVIDEOS SHOW ICE OFFICERS DRAWING WEAPONS\n\nWhile new internal ICE guidance, reported by Reuters in late January, instructed officers not to engage with protesters, the encounters have not stopped.\n\nTwo videos in recent weeks verified by Reuters showed ICE officers drawing their weapons as they approached vehicles that allegedly had been following them.\n\nSouth of Minneapolis on January 29, the same day Ringstrom was arrested, federal immigration officers abruptly swerved, stopped their vehicle and approached a woman driving behind them with guns drawn, according to dashcam footage ⁠from her vehicle first reported by Minnesota Public Radio and verified by Reuters.\n\nMcLaughlin said ICE officers were attempting to arrest a criminal offender when the woman began “stalking and obstructing” them, leading the officers to try to arrest ​her.\n\n“Law enforcement officers attempted to pull her over using their emergency lights to issue her a warning,” McLaughlin said. “Ignoring law enforcement commands, the agitator refused to pull over and began driving recklessly including running stop signs, nearly colliding with ​multiple vehicles, and driving directly at law enforcement in an attempt to ram their vehicle.”\n\nIn a separate incident on February 3, two ICE officers approached a car that had been following them, again, with guns drawn, according to video verified by Reuters and a DHS statement.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the vehicle had been “stalking” and “obstructing” ICE officers.\n\n“The agitators then followed the officers as they departed and made hand motions suggestive of possessing a firearm,” DHS said.\n\nUnder Trump, numerous DHS statements after violent encounters with immigration agents have been inaccurate ⁠or incomplete.\n\nSome Minnesota residents say they believe they are becoming the subject of an intimidation campaign.\n\nIn a suburb north of St. Paul on January 22, an ICE officer led a woman who was following his vehicle back to her house, making it clear that he knew her identity and address, Reuters-verified video filmed by the husband showed.\n\nThe woman’s husband spoke to the ICE officer outside of the couple’s house. When the husband questioned the tactic, the officer said, “You raise your voice, I erase your voice,” the video showed.\n\nOne ICE officer told Reuters they have led people following them back to their houses after running their license plates “to freak them out.”\n\nMcLaughlin said ICE would review body camera ⁠footage and investigate the incident in St. Paul, but did not comment on ICE using the tactic to frighten opponents.\n\nEarlier in January, two friends - Brandon Siguenza and Patty O’Keefe - who were following an ICE vehicle in Minneapolis said officers fired pepper spray into their car, smashed their car window and detained them for eight hours.\n\nMcLaughlin said officers gave them multiple warnings “to stop impeding” operations, but that they “chose to continue to stalk law enforcement and were arrested.”\n\n“The passenger refused to roll ‌down the window and exit the vehicle,” McLaughlin said. “ICE law enforcement followed their training and used the minimum amount of force necessary to make the arrest.”\n\nMcLaughlin did not explicitly confirm that officers broke the car window or deployed pepper spray.\n\nSiguenza and O’Keefe have not been charged.",

    "title": "The guy who designed the iPhone helped craft the interior of Ferrari's first EV — and it's full of physical buttons and knobs",
    "description": "Ferrari typically designs its cars in-house. The automaker sought legendary iPhone designer Jony Ive's guidance for its first EV.",
    "fullText": "Jony Ive designed the iPhone, which famously ditched most of a phone's physical buttons for virtual ones. His take on the new Ferrari interior shows a very different approach.\n\nFerrari has spent five years working with LoveFrom, the design studio founded by Ive and fellow Apple design alum Marc Newson, to shape the interior of its first EV, the Luce.\n\nThe result is a button-heavy, screen-forward cabin that blends Ferrari's performance ethos with high-end, Apple-style minimalism.\n\nFerrari hasn't released photos of the exterior or a full list of specs, but earlier disclosures suggest the Luce will be a four-door, four-seat electric car capable of reaching 60 mph from a standing start in 2.5 seconds. It's expected to have a 330-mile range.\n\nThe Luce marks Ferrari's leap into electrification — with an interior wrapped in Ive's distinctive design language. Here's what the interior looks like.\n\nFerrari — long synonymous with grunting, high-performance racers — is moving into the near-silence of electric power.\n\nTo guide that transition, the automaker worked with LoveFrom to refine the interior's materials, shapes, and controls.\n\nThe result looks nothing like most EVs. The Luce's cabin is lined with tactile hardware — rows of machined-metal toggles and physical switches designed to be clicked, not swiped.\n\nFor any curious Apple fans, there are some familiar flourishes: brushed aluminum, slim leather surfaces, and a minimalist layout.\n\nThe slim, three-spoke steering wheel keeps things simple — starting with directional controls mounted directly on the wheel.\n\nMore buttons sit beneath the silver spokes, putting most core functions within thumb's reach.\n\nOn the left are controls for cruise, drive modes, and dash lighting. On the right are power modes, suspension settings, and wipers.\n\nVolume and track controls are tucked behind the wheel, while paddles manage torque delivery, mimicking the engagement of traditional gear changes. Even in an EV, Ferrari wants drivers to feel like they're choosing their own gears.\n\nThe center infotainment display looks a bit like an oversized Apple Watch. Ferrari's system comes complete with fan-speed settings, heated-seat controls, and a built-in circular clock.\n\nThe tablet-like screen sits on a ball-and-socket joint, allowing it to swivel toward either the driver or the passenger.\n\nFerrari also says the silver bar below the screen is a palm rest — perfect for drivers to stabilize their hand while switching Spotify playlists in a sharp corner.\n\nFerrari is leaning heavily into glass for the Luce's interior, using Corning Gorilla Glass across many hard surfaces — including the gear selector.\n\nThe company says the material is more crack-resistant than typical smartphone glass and is designed to withstand scratches from daily use.\n\nThere's also a touch of whimsy in the key fob. The square Ferrari badge is the key: slot it into the console, and the glass fob turns black, disappearing into the surrounding trim.\n\nPick it up and walk away, and it glows Ferrari's signature racing yellow.\n\nThe gauge cluster behind the steering wheel takes inspiration from helicopter cockpits.\n\nFerrari says the digital display is mounted directly to the steering column, keeping critical high-speed information locked in the driver's line of sight.\n\nThe setup is also a first for Ferrari.\n\nAt the center is a hybrid speedometer: a physical needle floating over layered digital driving data, all viewed through a curved lens. While most modern cars have abandoned analog needles entirely, Ferrari kept one — blending old-school driving cues with a fully digital display.\n\nFerrari first revealed its all-electric project in October 2025 under the working name \"Elettrica.\" Now, it has an official name: the Luce (pronounced LOO-che).\n\nIn Italian, luce translates to \"light.\"\n\nThe partnership between Ferrari and LoveFrom — first reported in 2021 — resulted in an interior designed to signal the automaker's ambition to reimagine the electric-car experience from the ground up.\n\nIt's an unusual move for Ferrari, which rarely brings in outside design firms.\n\n\"The team focused on perfecting and refining every solution to its purest form,\" the automaker said in a press release.\n\nThe rest of the car, which was developed in-house, will be revealed in May. Ferrari has not confirmed pricing or availability for the new EV yet.",

    "description": "India has scrapped a planned concession for small cars in upcoming fuel-efficiency rules after automakers including Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra",
    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 9 (Reuters) - India has scrapped a planned concession for small cars in upcoming fuel-efficiency rules after automakers including Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra argued ​it would benefit only one company, a government document shows.\n\nA September draft had proposed leniency ‌for petrol cars weighing 909 kg (2,004 lb) or less - a carve-out widely seen as favouring Maruti Suzuki, which controls 95% of ‌India's small‑car market.\n\nIndia's Power Ministry has now removed that exemption and tightened other parameters, increasing pressure on all automakers to ramp up electric and hybrid car sales, according to the latest 41-page draft reviewed by Reuters.\n\nThe new rules curb over-compensation for vehicle weight, aim to level the field between light and heavy fleet ⁠manufacturers, and are designed to deliver ‌real-world efficiency gains, the document said.\n\nThey introduce \"a substantially steeper reduction pathway\" for emissions, it added.\n\nThe power ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPROMOTING ELECTRIC, HYBRID ‍MODELS\n\nTransport accounts for about 12% of India's energy use and is a major driver of petroleum imports and carbon emissions. Passenger vehicles make up nearly 90% of transport-related emissions, the document says.\n\nCorporate Average Fuel Efficiency norms dictate permissible ​CO2 emissions across a manufacturer's fleet of passenger cars weighing less than 3,500 kg (7,716 lb). Updated ‌every five years, they push automakers towards cleaner technologies including electrification, compressed natural gas and flex-fuel.\n\nThe new rules will apply from April 2027 for five years and are central to automakers' product and powertrain investment plans. It was not immediately clear when the rules will be finalised.\n\nThe September draft would have allowed fuel-consumption targets to rise faster with vehicle weight, easing compliance for makers of heavier cars such as ⁠Mahindra, Tata and Volkswagen, while tightening demands on lighter-fleet players ​such as Maruti. That imbalance prompted the carve-out.\n\nThe revised plan ​reduces the extent to which heavier vehicles gain more relaxed targets.\n\n\"Manufacturers with heavier fleets ... are required to achieve stronger intrinsic efficiency improvements,\" the document said.\n\nA credit system will ‍reward companies that sell more ⁠EVs and plug-in hybrids, and pooling of fuel-consumption performance between companies will be allowed. Non-compliance will draw penalties of up to $550 per car.\n\nThe revised plan aims to cut average fleet emissions ⁠to about 100 grams/km over the five years to March 2032 from 114 grams/km. With credits, that could fall to ‌as low as 76 grams/km if electric models reach 11% of total car sales ‌by 2032.",

    "description": "Tesla says cars can drive themselves with only cameras just like humans drive with their eyes. A Waymo exec disagrees with the comparison.",
    "fullText": "If people can drive with their eyes, can an AI drive only with cameras?\n\nTesla leans on that analogy to defend its hotly debated cameras-only approach to autonomous cars.\n\n\"It should be solved with cameras just like how every other human or animal lives around this world,\" Ashok Elluswamy, Tesla's vice president of AI, said at the ScaledML Conference on January 29. \"Self-driving problem is thought of as a sensor problem. It's actually not a sensor problem, it's an AI problem.\"\n\nAlphabet's Waymo has a fundamentally different engineering approach to autonomy. Srikanth Thirumalai, Waymo's vice president of onboard software, pushed back on Elluswamy's comparison.\n\n\"I think the bar is higher than human driving,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nThe contrast between Waymo and Tesla goes beyond philosophy and is built into the hardware.\n\nTesla wants to reach autonomy with fewer than 10 cameras and an AI trained on billions of miles of real-world driving data. Waymo also relies on AI, but is paired with a multi-sensor system — 29 cameras, five lidars, and six radars — to give the AI driver different ways to perceive an environment. The Alphabet company has so far deployed about 2,500 robotaxis across multiple US cities.\n\nThe debate often boils down to cost and safety: More sensors could increase costs, which could be a barrier to scale. Fewer sensors could present safety challenges, some say, which is another constraint for mass robotaxi adoption.\n\nThirumalai manages a team of more than 600 people building Waymo's AI driver software. During a rare interview at Waymo's HQ, which spans multiple buildings, the vice president told Business Insider he expects the sensor suite to shrink over time as the hardware improves and gets cheaper. But he framed the lidar or no-lidar debate as a distraction from the company's safety-oriented objective.\n\n\"Given where the technology is right now, the question is what is it going to take for that product to be safe?\" he said. \"So you work backwards from that safety bar and say, 'What does it take to build a safe product?' And then keep pushing and iterating and innovating to reduce the cost of the sensors, and to improve the quality of the software and how it uses the sensors.\"\n\nThe soft-spoken Thirumalai looked to the future and explained his position.\n\n\"In three to five years, will our sensor stack look different than it is right now? Absolutely.\"\n\nWaymo has previously said it expects the next generation of robotaxis to have fewer sensors: 13 cameras, four lidars, and six radars. A Waymo spokesperson previously told Business Insider that the company expects to serve public riders by late 2026.\n\nA Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHumans can be bad drivers. They're easily distracted, swayed by emotions, and can be slow to make the right decisions. Leaders in autonomy will say they're driven by a mission to build something safer than humans. The challenge is defining what \"safer\" means in a way that regulators, riders, and engineers can measure.\n\n\"This notion of what the bar is is a very important question,\" Thirumalai said. \"And one that we have only refined over the years, and in some cases, we're still sort of discovering what the bar is.\"\n\nInstead of an arbitrary goalpost that says robots will be multiple times safer than a human driver, Thirumalai said Waymo looks at individual driving cases and assesses how often those events can occur.\n\n\"We break it down and say, 'Well, how often do those events actually occur per million miles of driving? And how serious are those events?\" he said, adding that his team can then aim for a lower incident rate.\n\nThirumalai and even Waymo's top brass aren't selling perfection. A human fatality caused by a robotaxi isn't a matter of if but when, Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana has said.\n\nReports and videos shared across social media have shown that AVs can make mistakes, whether in school zones, emergency response scenes, bad weather, or even seemingly ordinary driving scenarios.\n\n\"People might say, 'Hey, look, this is AI. We never want it to make a mistake.' That is an unachievable bar,\" Thirumalai said.",

    "title": "F1 regulation change comes at a good time for younger drivers - Andrea Kimi Antonelli",
    "description": "F1 will introduce widespread regulation changes this year and the style required to race the new cars is vastly different to anything the drivers have experienced before",
    "fullText": "Andrea Kimi Antonelli is confident that Formula 1’s more inexperienced drivers will benefit from the 2026 regulation overhaul due to the need to adapt.\n\nF1 promises to look totally different this year with changes to both the chassis, lighter by 32kg plus less downforce, and engine, more reliant on electric power, after four years of ground effect cars.\n\nThere has been vast talk about how drivers will therefore need to adapt their style due to active aerodynamics and energy management playing a bigger role, with some claiming that the 2026 cars go against everything they were taught in karting.\n\nBut the younger drivers, like those who have only been in F1 since last year, may benefit from this overhaul because they’re already used to constantly changing cars and don’t really have one distinct style of racing to fall back on.\n\nAntonelli is one of those, having been fast-tracked to F1 by never contesting more than one season of a junior championship before making his Mercedes grand prix debut at the age of 18.\n\n“For all the rookies that joined F1 last year, coming into this year with a new car is kind of good, because obviously we've been used to drive a different car every year,” said the Italian teen.\n\n“So we've been used to try and adapt as quickly as possible to a new car. So of course on that side, it's good that we have a new car this year, because it's a reset for everyone. Especially for us, that we've been used to every year to a new car, it's good because we've been used to that. Maybe it will help us out to understand the car a bit quicker than others.”\n\nThe Mercedes driver therefore thinks it levels the playing field as everybody has to start from scratch, as opposed to last season where he came in at perhaps a disadvantage to others.\n\n“This is a massive rule change and it kind of resets everything because everyone has to relearn the car,” he added. “So on that side, it's better because obviously last year was last year's, the last year of the old regulation and most of the drivers, they knew the car very, very well and they've been developing that car.\n\n“While this year is definitely completely new, so on the driving side, it's a big opportunity because whoever understands it the best way and earlier than the others can really make the difference.”\n\nThat isn’t to say, however, that the veterans will struggle and automatically get beaten by the youngsters, because being inexperienced still proved costly for Antonelli last season.\n\nAlthough he impressed on occasions with three podiums and a Miami sprint pole, he also suffered many unforced crashes in practice and sometimes struggled with the pressures of being a highly-rated rookie - his home race at Imola being an example.\n\n“The other drivers are not stupid and they're pretty good,” said the 19-year-old. “So I think they will figure it out very quickly as well.\n\n“Experience still counts. With how you approach the year, every weekend, the experience still helps and because, of course, I've done one year in F1 and I've learned a lot, but this year, definitely I will have a different approach at times, but I feel I still need to learn quite a bit.\n\n“So on the experience side, there will still be a bit of a difference, but on the driving side, I think we're all on the same level now as we have the new car. So I think that is going to be a big, big opportunity.”\n\nMercedes rivals push for intervention over F1 engine loophole - but how realistic is it?\n\nGeorge Russell predicts F1 team most likely to challenge the top four in 2026\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "Would you buy a Chinese car?",
    "fullText": "The Geely, Lynk & Co, and Zeekr cars we drove were all ready for US primetime.\n\nThe Geely, Lynk & Co, and Zeekr cars we drove were all ready for US primetime.\n\nIt only took a brief drive in a Zeekr 7X to convince me: Chinese cars are now competitive and could be sold in the US tomorrow. The compact battery-electric crossover, a bestseller in Europe, is aimed directly at the Tesla Model Y with its five seats, two rows, impressive road grip, energetic performance, and smooth ride. Its price in China is around $32,000 — about $7,000 cheaper than Elon Musk’s crossover.\n\nIf you’ve followed automotive news recently, you might come away thinking Chinese cars are destined for the US, with Geely among the best positioned to break through first. That’s certainly a possibility — especially after President Donald Trump seemingly threw open the doors to Chinese automakers in a recent speech. The quid pro quo: They must be built in the US. Geely recently confirmed it was “actively evaluating” a possible entry into the world’s second-largest auto market and would have a decision within three years.\n\nGeely may be best placed to build cars here: Volvo Cars, which it controls, has had an auto plant up and running in South Carolina since 2018, where it builds Volvo and Polestar vehicles. (Volvo stated, “We do not have any plans to produce cars on behalf of Geely there.”) If Geely does attempt to enter the US market under its own brands, it likely won’t happen before 2029.\n\nStill, climbing out of the Zeekr 7X, I wondered — even if it were built in the US — whether it could legally be sold here. Will restrictions on automotive software that originates in China keep it out indefinitely? Or will Geely find a way to convince the US government that its technology poses no threat to US national security?\n\nMost US drivers won’t have heard of Geely, if they think about Chinese cars at all. Yet last year, parent company Geely Holding sold more than 4.1 million cars, making it China’s second-largest carmaker after BYD. It offers multiple brands that include Volvo, Polestar, Lotus, Malaysia’s Proton, Geely, Lynk & Co, Zeekr, and others.\n\nDuring CES last month, I got a chance for brief track drives in three vehicles from three different Geely brands. The last time I’d driven a Chinese car was August 2020; that Xpeng P7 simply wasn’t ready for primetime. It was one of only two cars I’ve driven where I could overwhelm the anti-lock brakes. But Chinese automakers innovate so fast that a 2020 Xpeng might as well have been from the late 1990s.\n\nThe Geely cars I drove would likely generate strong demand here in the US — as they already do in Mexico. That’s terrifying Detroit and European automakers alike, with GM CEO Mary Barra recently sounding the alarm about Chinese EVs coming to North America. New Chinese brands might choose to target anything from the low end of the mass market to the premium and luxury sector.\n\nFirst up was the Geely Starray, a compact crossover from the group’s mass-market brand, powered by a 215-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter gasoline engine driving the front wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. It had a full suite of ADAS safety functions, including adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capabilities.\n\nThe Geely cars I drove would likely generate strong demand here in the US.\n\nThe contrasting black roof over silver paint suggested high-end features, and interior equipment — powered front lumbar and leg-support bolsters on the driver’s seat, heated and cooled front seats — confirmed the impression. Interior plastics were comparable to those of Korean cars a couple of generations ago. The rear doors opened only to about a 45-degree angle, which limits access for larger people, baby seats, and so forth — odd for a family car in Mexico.\n\nOn the road, the Starray was pleasant enough. It accelerated smoothly to almost highway speeds — the track layout didn’t allow for long high-speed runs — and grip and roadholding were better than expected. But it felt sluggish when driven enthusiastically, and it was hardly a rewarding driver’s car. While I wouldn’t personally buy this one, plenty of value-oriented buyers likely would — at the right price. In Mexico, the Starray’s base price is about $31,630 in US currency. Our ride-along Geely rep twice suggested it could be a $25,000 car.\n\nI switched into a Lynk & Co 09, a midsize SUV from a brand it positions in Europe and Central America as a premium offering. Described by my Geely minder as a “hybrid,” it didn’t drive like one: Hard acceleration didn’t have that instant electric-motor thrust evident in virtually any modern hybrid. A small amount of added power arrived after a significant lag.\n\nIt turned out that the 09’s 2.0-liter, four-cylinder gas engine was paired with a Volvo mild-hybrid system that uses a 48-volt electric motor between the engine and eight-speed automatic transmission for a total output of 254hp among all four wheels. With a battery of just 0.2 kilowatt-hours, it adds incremental power to the engine, recovers some energy under regenerative braking, and restarts the engine at stops. The 48-volt system improves fuel economy, but plays a minimal role in propelling this 4,660-pound vehicle—unlike a full hybrid system operating at 300 volts that could power the car alone at low speeds.\n\nSignificantly, the 09 is built on the same SPA platform as the Volvo XC90 sold in the United States from 2016 onward. Its styling is the antithesis of the traditional, reassuring Volvo look: The headlights sit almost on top of the fenders, with three lengthwise light tubes under the glass. The bluff front end’s huge grille wraps its upper corners around the fender corners to hold the rest of the lights. The rear is more conventional SUV, with a horizontal light bar like so many others. Powered door handles give the sleek look of many EVs. In Mexico, its base price is $53,750 in US dollars. In China, on the other hand, the mild-hybrid 09 starts at $33,000.\n\nThe Zeekr 7X was my final test drive, the battery-electric crossover that clearly has the Tesla Model Y in its crosshairs. The 7X is built on the Geely SEA platform that also underpins the Volvo EX30 subcompact hatchback — though its wheelbase is a significant 4 inches longer, so its rear seat will hold adult-size humans. The 100kWh battery powers either a 416hp rear motor or a pair of motors totaling 637hp. Our test EV didn’t have the strongest regenerative braking in Sport mode, and I couldn’t test other modes in my limited time. The ride quality is considerably smoother than a Model Y, however, perhaps due to its curb weight of 5,313 pounds, fully 1,000 pounds more than the Tesla.\n\nGiven recent concerns over fully electronic door handles, it’s worth noting those of the 7X slide out from a flush position. To get them to do so, you first have to locate and push an adjacent round button. I found the seats comfortable for my particular build, though the interior was more conventional and “German,” with largely black trim — versus the new Model Y’s stripped-down, almost Scandinavian approach. More than any other vehicle on the lot, the Zeekr 7X was the one reporters and Geely execs viewed as a possible US entry. The key issue would be price. In China it sells for $32,000; the price in Mexico is roughly 97,000 pesos, or about $55,000.\n\nGiovanni Lanfranchi, CEO of Zeekr Technology Europe, is based in Gothenburg, Sweden, where Volvo has been based for almost 100 years. Until a restructuring last year, Volvo owned 30 percent shares of both Zeekr and Lynk & Co. Major changes followed the September 2024 Taizhou Declaration from Geely founder and chairman Li Shufu. The single-page document demanded that all Geely R&D activities focus on developing every new vehicle from shared components, not just vehicle platforms but also software architectures and application layers.\n\nMore than any other vehicle on the lot, the Zeekr 7X was the one reporters and Geely execs viewed as a possible US entry.\n\nLanfranchi said since then, he has been “shocked” at the speed of what became “profound, radical change” in Geely’s R&D groups in Gothenburg and Frankfurt, which work side by side with their counterparts in China.\n\nJust 16 months after the declaration, each brand already has a new vehicle on an entirely common architecture. The Geely M9, Lynk & Co 900, and Zeekr 9X shown at CES are all built on the SEA-S 900V long-range plug-in hybrid platform announced in July. They share 90 percent of their components and software, Lanfranchi said — whereas earlier Zeekr models used platforms developed by its own R&D group just for its own models.\n\nGeely now plans to launch new vehicles in China and Europe simultaneously, rather than delaying up to a year while a Chinese-designed vehicle is adapted to conditions in other markets.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump dropped a bombshell. He’d be entirely fine with Chinese automakers selling in the US, he told the Detroit Economic Club — as long as they open plants to build them in this country.\n\nGeely can probably do so more easily and faster than any other Chinese maker. The plant in Ridgeville, South Carolina, presently only builds Volvo and Polestar vehicles. But with common platforms and identical underlying software architectures, and Volvo and Polestar migrating onto them, Lanfranchi sees “no reason not to” build group vehicles in the Volvo factory. He stressed that such a move was not his to make, and no decision had been announced. But in the end, he mused, “I think it may happen.”\n\nMichael Dunne, CEO of Dunne Insights and an expert on China’s auto industry, called Geely’s US entry “absolutely possible, likely, and probable.” The company has long felt, he said, that the US would be “its destiny.”\n\nDunne noted that Chinese EVs in the UK, led by BYD and MG, are roughly 15 percent cheaper than Japanese and Korean models. “The Chinese don’t have to be scary cheap,” he said. “They just need to be priced low enough to make you pause — then take a closer look.”\n\nThat’s exactly how German, Japanese, and then Korean makers built their businesses, along with features domestic cars didn’t offer, from smaller cars to bulletproof reliability to long warranties. Those countries, of course, are allies of the US — China is not.",

    "fullText": "A routine fuel stop turned into a national political flashpoint after a gas station employee refused service to federal immigration agents, igniting a debate that now reaches far beyond politics and squarely into the automotive and fuel retail space.\n\nThe incident unfolded at a Speedway gas station in Minneapolis when Border Patrol agents attempted to refuel government vehicles during official operations.\n\nAccording to video footage that quickly spread online, a man identifying himself as the store’s manager denied service and stated bluntly that he did not support ICE, adding that no one at the store did either. The agents were told to leave without being allowed to purchase fuel.\n\nWithin hours, the encounter became a lightning rod. Critics accused the business of politicizing a basic commercial service, while supporters framed the refusal as a form of protest.\n\nBut for the automotive and fuel industries, the episode raises deeper questions about neutrality, safety, and the evolving role of gas stations in an increasingly polarized environment.\n\nFuel stations occupy a unique position in American infrastructure for the simple fact that they aren’t simply retail outlets. They are essential service points relied upon by private motorists, commercial fleets, emergency responders, and, yes, government agencies like ICE.\n\nDenying fuel is not equivalent to refusing a cup of coffee or retail merchandise. Vehicles without fuel do not operate, and in the case of law enforcement or emergency services, that reality carries serious implications.\n\nIndustry experts note that while private businesses generally retain the right to refuse service, gas stations historically operate under an expectation of political neutrality. Fleet contracts, fuel cards, and government supply agreements are built on reliability, not ideology.\n\nOnce a station is perceived as selectively serving customers based on political or occupational identity, that reliability comes into question.\n\nThe fallout for Speedway and its parent companies has been swift. Calls for boycotts surfaced almost immediately, with critics warning that the brand risks alienating everyday drivers who view fuel access as nonpartisan.\n\nOthers warned of reputational damage that could ripple across franchise networks, where individual store decisions can reflect on national brands regardless of corporate policy.\n\nThere is also a safety dimension that automotive analysts are watching closely. Federal agents often refuel during active operations or long-distance deployments. Forcing vehicles to reroute in search of fuel introduces delays and unpredictability.",

    "description": "Senate lawmakers questioned executives from Tesla and Waymo, and grilled Waymo's chief safety officer over Chinese cars and foreign workers.",
    "fullText": "What started as a policy hearing on self-driving cars turned tense for Waymo.\n\nLawmakers on Wednesday accused the robotaxi company of relying too heavily on Chinese vehicles and offshore labor, leading to a tense back-and-forth during a two-hour Senate hearing.\n\nAfter autonomous vehicle executives said earlier in the hearing that US companies risk falling behind Chinese rivals, senators flipped that back on Waymo's chief safety officer, Mauricio Peña.\n\n\"You said in your testimony that we're locked in a race with China, but it seems like you're getting in bed with China,\" Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio said, pointing to Waymo's plans to use vehicles made by a subsidiary of Geely, a Chinese automaker.\n\nPeña said the Alphabet-owned company uses a mix of platforms, but Moreno pushed back, questioning if Waymo was using a \"backdoor\" to sidestep the federal \"connected vehicle\" rule, which restricts foreign-linked technology in sensitive systems.\n\nUnder US rules finalized last year, vehicles with certain autonomous or connected software tied to China will face import restrictions, though key provisions are not yet fully in effect.\n\nWaymo first partnered with Zeekr, a Chinese automaker owned by Geely, in 2021. Since then, the company has spent several years adapting and testing a minivan-style vehicle built by Zeekr for its robotaxi program.\n\nA Waymo spokesperson told TechCrunch last month that it will rename the Zeekr robotaxi to Ojai, citing concerns that the US public may be unfamiliar with the Zeekr brand.\n\nPeña said the Chinese-made cars have \"no connectivity\" and that the driving system is installed in the US. He added that tapping a broader global supply chain helps the company scale faster and remain resilient.\n\nMoreno wasn't buying it. \"Giving a natural market to a Chinese company to ship us cars is making us better and creating more jobs for Americans? That's completely ridiculous,\" he said.\n\nOn overseas labor, Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts called Waymo's use of remote human operators in countries outside the US \"completely unacceptable.\"\n\nPeña said that while some operators are located in the US, others work abroad, including in the Philippines. These operators typically step in when robotaxis encounter unusual situations.\n\n\"Having people overseas influencing American vehicles is a safety issue,\" Markey said. He warned that these workers may need to react \"in a split second\" during dangerous scenarios, yet are located overseas.\n\nMarkey also tied the issue to jobs, saying that Waymo is moving some roles overseas while developing technology that could replace US taxi and ride-hailing drivers.\n\nEarlier in the hearing, Waymo and Tesla executives framed autonomous vehicles as a race the US cannot afford to lose.\n\nWaymo warned that Chinese companies could set global standards for self-driving technology if Washington fails to act by setting regulations that could help companies move fast.\n\n\"We are locked in a race with Chinese companies for the future of autonomous vehicles,\" Peña told lawmakers, adding that without a clear national framework, the US risks a \"fragmented landscape of state regulations\" that slows investment and limits access.\n\n\"For America to lead in AV technology, we must modernize regulations that inhibit the industry's ability to innovate,\" said Lars Moravy, Tesla's vice president of vehicle engineering, referring to autonomous vehicle technology.\n\n\"Federal regulations for vehicles have not kept up with the pace of the rapid evolution of technology. Many standards were implemented decades ago and do not adequately address modern advancements,\" he added.\n\nIndustry leaders have repeatedly warned about China's lead in the EV market.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley said in an episode of The Verge's \"Decoder\" podcast that \"the Chinese are the 700-pound gorilla in the EV industry.\"\n\n\"There's no real competition from Tesla, GM, or Ford with what we've seen from China. It is completely dominating the EV landscape globally and more and more outside of China,\" he said in September.",

Automakers such as Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Toyota (TM) (the hybrid leader) are looking to offer more hybrid options in the future.\n\nHere are the top 10 new vehicles on Consumer Reports' 2026 list:\n\n(New addition to the list.) Consumer Reports said the Honda (HMC) Civic is an overall excellent sedan, but the hybrid is the best version. \"It possesses all the qualities Consumer Reports' automotive experts love about the gas-only sedan, including quick and responsive steering, a comfortable ride, and a spacious interior.\"\n\nConsumer Reports noted that the Toyota Camry is now sold exclusively as a hybrid, powered by a 2.5L four-cylinder engine that got 48 mpg overall in CR's testing. \"The latest iteration strikes a pleasing balance between ride comfort and capable handling, offers practical interior space, and features user-friendly controls that effectively utilize physical knobs and switches.\"\n\nConsumer Reports said the Subaru (FUJHY) Crosstrek returned to the list due to positive additions like the new, more powerful hybrid powertrain with an EPA-estimated 36 mpg combined. \"The Crosstrek handles well, with quick steering and minimal roll through turns, but it's the ride quality that's most noteworthy.\"\n\nAlso returning is the Forester, which Consumer Reports said benefits from a new fuel-efficient hybrid powertrain, a 2.5L four-cylinder engine boosted by hybrid tech sourced from partner Toyota — good for five more miles per gallon compared to the gas version. \"Unlike most other small hybrid SUVs, which only offer limited all-wheel drive, the Forester Hybrid has a mechanical, full-time AWD system.\"",

    "fullText": "Toyota's luxury brand Lexus routinely ranks among the world's most reliable auto brands; plenty of owners say their Lexus vehicles have lasted beyond 100,000 miles. According to iSeeCars, some of those Lexus owners might still have plenty of life left in their cars and SUVs. The outlet looked at year-to-year odometer readings from hundreds of thousands of vehicles to predict how likely each model was to stay running past the 250,000 mile mark. Four of the top 25 vehicles most likely to reach a quarter of a million miles wear Lexus badges; The only automakers with more models on the list are parent company Toyota with 10 and Honda with five.\n\niSeeCars previously named the Toyota Tundra as the longest-lasting light-duty pickup truck, and it came in fourth among all vehicles in the latest study while the Tacoma placed sixth overall. Lexus doesn't make pickup trucks, but it placed at least one model among the top five SUVs and passenger cars most likely to hit 250,000 miles. Lexus offers certain models with the buyer's choice of a conventional or hybrid powertrain, and iSeeCars ranks those variants separately. In those cases we ordered our list according to the more favorable performer of the pair with additional notation of where the other version fell in the rankings.\n\nSlashgear's hands-on review of the 2021 Lexus IS300 found the compact sedan in its all-wheel drive(AWD) form to be \"unexpectedly punchy,\" and the 2025 IS came in fifth among all vehicles in the iSeeCars study and first among all passenger car models with a 27.5% chance of making it to 250K miles. This makes it more than 10 times as likely to last that long as the average vehicle and more than twice as likely as the Toyota Prius, which was 15th overall and third among passenger cars. The IS was outpaced in the iSeeCars 250,000-mile study only by four Toyota models: the Tundra pickup and the Sequoia, Highlander Hybrid and 4Runner SUVs.\n\nThe IS300 is gone for the current model year, replaced by the IS350 F Sport and F Sport Design. All variants share a 3.5-liter V6 that produces 311 horsepower and come with an automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive variants have eight gears, and all-wheel drive IS350s have six speeds.\n\nCar and Driver clocked the rear-drive version at 5.6 seconds from 0-60 and the AWD variant at 5.5 ticks, and 0-100 mpg and quarter-mile times were identical for both at 14.2 seconds. The IS350 took 326 feet to come to a stop from 100 mph and pulled .89g on a 300-foot wide skidpad.\n\nEnty point for the model is the IS 350 F Sport Design RWD version which starts at $46,795 with destination fees and before tax, title, and options. Opting for all-wheel drive adds another $2,000 to that cost, and the range-topping IS350 F Sport with the special appearance package starts at $61,385 with destination charges.\n\nWe found that the 2023 Lexus GX is a serious SUV with big capability, and iSeeCars ranked it as the eighth most likely vehicle overall to make it to 250,000 miles. It registered an 18.3% likelihood of reaching that mark, which placed it fourth among all SUVs behind its three Toyota cousins. A total of 21 SUVs were more likely than the average vehicle to last past 250K miles, and nine of those are Toyota or Lexus products.\n\nThe five variants of the 2026 Lexus GX550 are all powered by a 3.4-liter twin-turbo V6 that puts 349 horsepower to all four wheels via a 10-speed automatic transmission. All but the off-road focused Overtrail version seat up to seven passengers in three rows; the Overtrail seats five in a traditional 2+3 configuration. It's also the most capable variant for towing with a maximum capacity of 9,096 pounds, and the electronic locking rear differential keeps it sure-footed in slippery conditions. Starting price for the 2026 Lexus GX sits at $66,935 with destination charges for the entry-level Premium trim and goes up to $83,400 for the well-appointed Luxury+ variant. Opting for that version gets you a Mark Levinson surround sound system with 21 speakers and 1,800 watts of power, a panoramic glass roof, and motorized fold-away running boards.\n\nThe Lexus RX model designation stands for 'Radiant Crossover,' and the hybrid version of the mid-sized SUV came in at ninth overall in the iSeeCars study and fifth among SUVs with a 17% chance of lasting 250,000 miles. The RX with a conventional drivetrain had a 10.7% chance of lasting that long, which placed it 19th among all vehicles and at No. 9 among SUVs. Among hybrid vehicles it trailed only its Toyota Highlander Hybrid cousin, and the Lexus RX Hybrid finished ahead of other Toyota hybrids like the Prius, Camry, and RAV4.\n\nThere are actually three Lexus RX hybrids to choose from. The RX350h has a 2.4-liter inline-four plus three electric motors that combine for 246 horsepower, the RX450h plug-in hybrid has 304 horses and an all-electric range of up to 38 miles, and the turbocharged RX500h has a bigger battery that helps enable output of 366 net combined horsepower. The non-hybrid RX350 has the turbocharged 2.4-liter engine set up for 275 horsepower but is only 2.2 times as likely as the average vehicle to last more than 250,000 miles.\n\nPricing for the hybrid versions starts with the 2026 RX 350h AWD at $52,025 plus $1,450 delivery, totaling $53,475. The RX non-hybrid starts at $49,725 plus options, tax, title, and that same $1,450 destination charge for a total of $51,175. Adding all-wheel drive to the gas-powered RX 350 costs just an extra $1,000, but the top-trim RX500h Sport Performance variant starts at $66,850 with destination charges.\n\nThe 2025 Lexus ES hybrid didn't make ISeeCars overall top 25 list of vehicles likely to last 250,000 miles, but it came in 10th among all passenger cars tested with a 7.5% chance of going that far. A 2026 redesign of the ES made it six inches longer for more interior space, and a bigger infotainment screen and updated climate control knobs make that space more useful. Our review of the 2024 Lexus ES found it capable and comfortable, and the non-hybrid 2025 Lexus ES ranked as the 12th-most likely passenger car to hit 250,000 miles in ISeeCars' study.\n\nThe 2026 Lexus ES was introduced as an all-electric model so you'll have to check dealerships for leftover 2025 examples if you want the mild hybrid version. We found a black 2025 ES300h in greater Los Angeles for $44,835 with the $1,250 destination charge included but before tax, title, and license fees.\n\nIt's loaded with features like paddle shifters for the eight-speed automatic gearbox, all-wheel drive with Lexus' Dynamic Torque Control system, and Lexus Safety System+ version 2.5. That includes collision avoidance with automatic braking, active cruise control, lane keeping and departure warning, and road sign recognition systems.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "description": "After a severe storm, you may stumble upon old pieces of cars in Misquamicut Beach. Read the quirky story behind how they ended up buried in the sand",
    "fullText": "Some years ago, The Andrea, a seasonal seafood restaurant on the west end of Misquamicut Beach in Westerly, posted a black-and-white photo on Facebook showing a line of cars buried in the sand.\n\nThe cars, about 20 of them, had their windows smashed and looked as though they were made in the 1940s or 1950s.\n\n“Tell me what you think you know about the cars. Free drink to whoever comes close to the truth behind the cars. ... Good luck!” the post said.\n\nThe post generated more than 300 guesses. Some of them were submitted by people just having fun.\n\n“These cars were all impounded for parking illegally in front of the Ocean House,” joked one person.\n\n“People trying to avoid the 20.00 parking fee at the state beach?” asked another.\n\n“Used car dealer that went under so to speak,” punned a third.\n\nSome, however, were closer to the mark.\n\n“There was a flood, I think back in 54, the cars got buried,” went one guess. “The cars were left there covered with sand as a blockade/barrier in front of the Andrea hotel. I believe after Hurricane Sandy, you could see some of the cars again.”\n\nRebecca Colucci, whose family owns The Andrea, remembers the story of the buried cars.\n\n“The year was 1954,” she told The Providence Journal. “Hurricane Carol came first and then we were hit by Hurricane Edna. It may be the only time in history that New England was hit with two category 3 hurricanes in one year.”\n\nThe storm left many cars with water damage. Ralph Colucci, Rebecca’s grandfather, offered to pick them up and dispose of them.\n\n“His idea was to bury them as deep as he could and create a barrier against coastal storms. He lined the cars up, smashed the windows and put heavy chains around the cars linking them together,” Colucci said.\n\nRalph Colucci apparently buried cars twice, once in 1954 and again in the 1960s, according to Nina Wright, who oversees special collections and reference at the Westerly Library.\n\nA news clip from 1967 seems to confirm this account.\n\n“For many years Ralph Colucci, owner of a beach-front hotel on Misquamicut Beach, had the problem of beach erosion causing damage to his hotel when the ocean would [wash] away the sand bank in front of his hotel,” the clip reads. “Two years ago Colucci had a row of junk cars buried in a long ditch and covered with sand. So far the cars have prevented the sand bank from being washed away”\n\nSince then, storms have unearthed pieces of the cars. Thomas Gulluscio, president of the Westerly Historical Society, said locals used to gauge the severity of storms by whether they exhumed Colucci’s buried cars.\n\n“I do remember as a kid saying, ‘Oh boy, the storm last night was so bad you could see the cars at the end here,’” Gulluscio said.\n\nOther locals, in comments on Facebook, reminisce playing as children along the sand and seeing the exposed vehicles after storms.\n\nHurricane Sandy in 2012 was one of the most severe storms to hit Misquamicut Beach. It caused severe damage to The Andrea, which until then had been a hotel. The Colucci family tore down the building, preserving the hotel’s old historic fireplace, and built a restaurant in its place.\n\nRebecca Colucci remembers after Hurricane Sandy finding a car part under the patio area close to the main building.\n\n“We have always removed them and disposed of them properly, but there might be a few more,” she said.\n\nAs for who got a free drink for correctly guessing the story of the cars, she is not sure.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Providence Journal: Section of Misquamicut Beach has cars buried in it to reduce erosion",

    "description": "From the Datsun 240Z and BMW 2002 to the Porsche 914 and Alfa Romeo GTV, these classics offer real style, character, and driving fun without the sky-high price tags. They’re smart picks for enthusiasts who want collectibility on a budget.",
    "fullText": "The classic car market can be a puzzling place. While some vehicles command astronomical prices that seem disconnected from reality, others remain surprisingly affordable despite having all the right ingredients for collectibility.\n\nThese special gems offer genuine performance, striking looks, or fascinating backstories that should make them far more valuable than their current market prices suggest. But hey, we're not complaining!\n\nThe 240Z helped redefine the affordable sports car formula that many manufacturers still chase today. With its long hood, short deck proportions, and genuinely capable inline six engine, period road tests showed performance quick enough to worry entry-level European sports cars, at a fraction of the price.\n\nClean examples still trade for reasonable money compared to their European contemporaries, despite the Z-car's massive influence on automotive design and its role in establishing Japan as a serious player in the sports car world.\n\nAmerican Motors' answer to the Camaro and Mustang had arguably the cleanest design of any pony car from the era. The Javelin's distinctive fastback profile and well-balanced proportions put it ahead of its more popular rivals in the styling department.\n\nYet these cars remain overlooked by collectors who gravitate toward the Big Three offerings, making the Javelin one of the best bargains in the muscle car space.\n\nFew cars blend Italian passion with practical usability quite like the GTV. Its Bertone-designed coupe body wrapped around Alfa's sweet-revving twin-cam four-cylinder engine, creating a driving experience that was both spirited and refined.\n\nWhile other Italian exotics from the period command serious money, the GTV continues to fly under the radar despite offering genuine Alfa character at accessible prices.\n\nThe mid-engine 914 was ahead of its time, offering balanced handling and Porsche engineering in a package that purists initially rejected for not being a \"real\" Porsche. Decades later, the automotive world has embraced mid-engine sports cars, yet the 914 remains the affordable entry point into vintage Porsche ownership.\n\nIts unique targa top design and nimble chassis make it a joy to drive, especially the later 2.0-liter models.\n\nBefore the 3 Series became the benchmark for compact sport sedans, there was the 2002. This boxy little BMW practically created the template for European sport sedans with its rear-wheel drive layout, responsive handling, and just enough power to be entertaining.\n\nDespite its historical significance and the rabid following that modern BMW enthusiasts have developed, clean 2002s remain surprisingly attainable compared to other foundational sports cars.\n\nRally fans know the Fulvia HF for its works competition history, including helping Lancia win the 1972 International Championship for Manufacturers, but the road-going versions remain undervalued. The narrow-angle V4 engine and front-wheel drive layout created a unique character that was both sophisticated and engaging to drive.\n\nThese cars combined Italian craftsmanship with genuine performance credentials, yet they trade for a fraction of what other European sports cars from the period command.\n\nThe Europa's wedge-shaped fiberglass body wrapped around Lotus's trademark lightweight philosophy, creating one of the purest driving experiences of the era. While it required some mechanical sympathy and wasn't the most practical choice, the Europa offered a lightweight mid-engine driving experience with sharp handling, but not supercar straight-line performance.\n\nToday's values still reflect that accessibility, even though the car's innovative mid-engine design and lightweight philosophy have made it far more influential than its prices suggest.\n\nSaab's quirky sports car combined Scandinavian design sensibilities with a surprisingly capable chassis and a Ford Taunus-sourced V4 engine that Saab used widely in that era. The Sonett's distinctive styling and unconventional engineering approach made it unlike anything else on American roads during its brief production run.\n\nIts rarity and unique character should make it a collector favorite, yet these distinctive coupes remain one of the most affordable ways to own a piece of Swedish automotive history.\n\nGeneral Motors' European division created what many consider a baby Corvette with the GT's dramatic styling and pop-up headlights. The car's Coke-bottle proportions and distinctive profile turned heads everywhere, while the available 1.9-liter engine provided adequate performance for the era.\n\nDespite its connection to GM design trends of the era and a Coke bottle shape that also showed up on contemporary Corvettes, the Opel GT remains surprisingly affordable for such a visually striking car.\n\nThese nine cars represent excellent opportunities for enthusiasts who want to own a piece of automotive history without paying premium prices. Each offers something special, whether it's innovative engineering, timeless design, or cultural significance that shaped the industry. The classic car market has a way of eventually recognizing quality, so these undervalued gems might not stay affordable forever.\n\nFor now, they represent some of the best values in the collector car world for those willing to look beyond the obvious choices.",

    "description": "2026 F1 cars may not provide easier overtaking than their predecessors, the Haas drivers fear",
    "fullText": "Both Esteban Ocon and Oliver Bearman are pessimistic about overtaking with Formula 1’s 2026 machinery following the Barcelona pre-season test.\n\nThe Haas drivers were on track for three days – as many as allowed – in F1’s ‘shakedown’ last week and completed nearly 400 laps according to unofficial data.\n\nThat was enough to get a taste of the new VF-26, which meets F1’s revamped chassis and engine regulations for the upcoming season, featuring stripped-down aerodynamics as downforce is reduced by 15-30% and drag is cut by up to 40%.\n\nYet, overtaking may prove even trickier than in the past, based on early impressions from the Catalan running – even with the new Overtake Mode replacing DRS, which is a power boost for drivers within one second of a rival.\n\n“I've been following a few cars,” Ocon said. “You seem to lose quite a lot of front load, a bit more maybe than before, but we need to see. And the Overtake [Mode], yes, I played with it.\n\n“I don't want to give too early conclusions on how it's going to be because obviously, you know, it needs to be adjusted, optimised, etc., for that to work in a perfect way. But so far, it looks to be difficult to pass. That's my first thought about it, but I hope it's going to get on the easier side.”\n\nSophomore team-mate Bearman concurred, pointing out ‘quite a big shift in car balance’ in dirty air right behind another car.\n\n“In terms of following and overtaking and everything, I didn't really get a massive feeling on that of course, it's not a priority,” the 20-year-old Briton commented. “I managed to do a few laps in and around other cars.\n\n“I must say that it was a bit more challenging to follow, just given my relatively few laps I did. It picked up quite a big shift in balance compared to clean air, which seemed a bit more so than the previous generation of cars. But again, it's very early days.\n\n“No, I didn't really get to use the overtake mode, but I was still able to try it just in clean air. We need to obviously see the difference in cooling and all of those things. So I was able to try it, but I wasn't able to use it to overtake someone, if that makes sense.”\n\nLewis Hamilton: ‘New F1 cars more fun to drive’ than previous eras\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "title": "11 Performance Cars From the 1970s That Were Misunderstood at the Time",
    "description": "The 1970s strangled horsepower with emissions rules, fuel shocks, and insurance pressure—yet a handful of clever performance cars slipped through. Here are 11 machines once dismissed as weird or weak, now praised for lightness, handling, turbo tech, and real-world charm.",
    "fullText": "The 1970s weren't kind to performance cars. Between stricter emissions regulations, the oil crisis, and insurance companies declaring war on horsepower, the decade seemed intent on killing off the muscle car era entirely. But while enthusiasts mourned the loss of their big-block monsters, they missed something important: several manufacturers were quietly figuring out how to make fast cars work in this new reality.\n\nThese 11 performance machines were dismissed, ridiculed, or simply ignored when they were new, but history has been far more generous in its assessment.\n\nAMC's oddball compact looked like it was designed by someone who gave up halfway through, but a Gremlin ordered with the available 304 cubic inch V8 was genuinely punchy for the era. The 304 was rated around 150 horsepower (SAE net) when it arrived for 1972. In a small car, performance could be lively, but published 0 to 60 times varied by test and spec.\n\nPeople laughed at the styling, but AMC understood that lighter cars with smaller V8s were the future of affordable performance.\n\nEnthusiasts accused the 914 of not being a \"real Porsche\" because it had a Volkswagen engine and a reasonable price tag. Its unique looks stand out from Porsche's familiar shape, and the mid-engine layout gave it handling that embarrassed more expensive sports cars, and the 914/6 version with the Porsche flat-six was legitimately fast.\n\nToday, clean examples sell for serious money as collectors finally appreciate what they dismissed as a parts-bin special.\n\nAmerican car magazines initially treated Nissan's sports car like a curiosity rather than a legitimate performance machine. The 240Z delivered 150 horsepower, a 125 mph top speed, and handling that could run with Porsches for about half the price.\n\nIt took a few years for people to realize that Datsun had essentially built a better E-Type Jaguar without the electrical gremlins.\n\nYes, the Vega had exaggerated reliability issues that would make a British Leyland engineer blush, but the GT version with the optional handling package was surprisingly fun to drive. The aluminum four-cylinder’s output depended heavily on year and rating method. Early gross ratings could be quoted as high as 110 hp for certain versions, but early 1970s net ratings were typically lower. The suspension tuning could still be genuinely competent, even if the power numbers were not always as impressive as the brochure era suggests.\n\nIf GM had solved the Vega’s early durability issues, the Vega GT might be remembered as an American sporty coupe instead of a punchline.\n\nIt made 139 horsepower, which sounds pathetic until you remember that a 1980 Corvette’s base engine was rated at 190 horsepower, while the optional higher-output version was rated higher depending on specification.\n\nThe handling was surprisingly good thanks to the compact dimensions, and today's collectors are starting to appreciate these as the last affordable classic Mustangs.\n\nEveryone remembers the Trans Am, but the Formula could be a close cousin depending on the year and options. Both shared the same basic platform, and many performance parts were available across the range, but engines and suspension packages varied by model year and configuration, and some high-performance pieces were not universal.\n\nPontiac sold and produced far fewer Formulas because people wanted the Trans Am's image, but smart buyers got the same experience without paying for the billboard.\n\nBMW built Europe's first turbocharged production car in 1973, and the automotive press responded with confusion and concern about turbo lag. The 2002 Turbo made 170 horsepower and could hit 130 mph, making it one of the fastest sedans available.\n\nOnly 1,672 were built before the oil crisis killed it, and those that survive are worth a small fortune today.\n\nThe Stratos was too weird, too impractical, and too purpose-built for rallying to make sense as a road car. With a Ferrari Dino V6 mounted behind the seats and a wheelbase shorter than a modern Mini Cooper, it drove like a go-kart designed by someone on espresso.\n\nLancia built about 492 Stratos road cars for homologation purposes, and now they're six-figure collectibles that dominated top-level rally results in the mid-1970s.\n\nMopar fans obsessed over Cudas and Challengers while the humble Duster delivered similar performance for thousands less. The 340 cubic inch V8 made 275 horsepower in 1970 and could run mid-14-second quarter miles right off the showroom floor. It was essentially a cheap body on Plymouth's excellent\n\nAn A-body platform, but people dismissed it as a secretary's car with a bigger engine.\n\nRotary engines seemed like a gimmick to most Americans, and the RX-3's tinny build quality didn't help its case. Mazda RX-3 power and engine details varied by market and year. Some early RX-3 road tests cite about 110 bhp from the smaller 10A rotary, while later versions used larger rotary engines, and US emissions-era net ratings could be lower. Weight also varied by body style and equipment, but the car was generally light for its class.\n\nThe RX-3 was very successful in SCCA competition in the mid-1970s, even while some buyers and readers remained skeptical of rotary engines and fuel economy.\n\nWhen the Esprit debuted in late 1975 and entered production in 1976, critics complained it was underpowered with about 160 horsepower in European trim from its 2.0-liter four-cylinder, with lower ratings in some US versions. What they missed was that Lotus had built a mid-engine exotic that weighed about 2,116 pounds and handled like it was on rails.\n\nThe wedge styling looked like it came from a science fiction movie, and while early cars had quality issues, the Esprit established Lotus as a legitimate supercar manufacturer for the next three decades.\n\nThe 1970s forced the automotive industry to rethink everything it knew about performance, and these twelve cars represent different approaches to the same problem. Some went lighter, some went turbo, and some just ignored convention entirely. What they share is that contemporary audiences didn't quite know what to make of them, whether due to unfamiliar technology, unconventional packaging, or simply showing up at the wrong moment in history.\n\nToday, these misunderstood machines are finally getting the recognition they deserved all along, proving that sometimes the automotive press and buying public need a few decades of perspective to separate the genuinely interesting cars from the merely loud ones.",

    "fullText": "The 2026 Mustang GT is no slouch, reaching 60 mph in roughly the low 4-second range depending on configuration, and its top speed is typically governed to about 155 mph. We are talking about the standard GT here, which is still impressive. But here's the thing: some classic cars from the golden age of automotive engineering can still give it a run for its money.\n\nThese vintage speed machines prove that raw performance isn't just a modern invention; it's been around since the days of carburetors and cassette players.\n\nThis German supercar was so advanced it basically invented the blueprint for modern performance vehicles.\n\nWith a 0-60 time of 3.6 seconds and a top speed of 197 mph, the 959's twin-turbo flat-six and all-wheel-drive system delivered performance that still holds up nearly 40 years later.\n\nEnzo Ferrari's last approved project was built to celebrate the company's 40th anniversary, and it didn't mess around.\n\nThe F40 is often quoted at about 201 mph at the top end and around the high 3-second range to 60 mph, and it is widely cited as one of the first production cars to cross the 200 mph mark. Published tests and definitions vary, though, and some outlets also credited the Ruf CTR with an even higher top speed around the same era.\n\nThe poster car of the 1980s wasn't just about looks; its 5.2-liter V12 meant business.\n\nThis version of the Countach managed 0 to 60 mph in roughly the low 4-second range and had a top speed commonly listed around 183 mph, with a soundtrack that could wake the dead.\n\nKnown affectionately as the \"widowmaker\" for its tricky handling, the 930 Turbo packed a serious punch with its turbocharged flat-six.\n\nLater models typically reached 60 mph in roughly the mid-4 to about 5-second range depending on the year and market, and top speed was around 160 mph depending on the specification, with enough turbo lag to make every acceleration feel like an event.\n\nBuilt to qualify for Group B racing, the 288 GTO was essentially a race car with license plates.\n\nIts twin-turbo V8 delivered a 0 to 60 mph time often quoted around 5 seconds, with a top speed commonly listed around 189 mph, wrapped in one of Pininfarina's most elegant designs.\n\nThe car that defined the mid-engine supercar layout still impresses with its 4.0-liter V12.\n\nThe ultimate SV version could sprint to 60 mph in roughly the 6-second range in period testing, and its top speed is commonly listed around 180 mph.\n\nWith its iconic side strakes and flat-12 engine, the Testarossa was Miami Vice on wheels.\n\nThe 4.9-liter powerplant pushed it to 60 mph in 5.2 seconds and on to a top speed of 180 mph, making it one of the fastest cars of the 1980s.\n\nPorsche's front-engine grand tourer was meant to replace the 911, and while that didn't happen, it proved itself plenty capable.\n\nThe S4's 5.0-liter V8 delivered a 0 to 60 mph time often quoted around 5.1 to 5.5 seconds and a top speed around 165 mph for manuals, with automatics often listed slightly lower.\n\nAn Italian body wrapped around Ford's 351 Cleveland V8 created something special.\n\nThe GTS version is often quoted at roughly the mid-5-second range to 60 mph, and top speed is commonly listed around 160 mph, with some period figures higher depending on the test and specification.\n\nNamed after Ferrari's 1-2-3 finish at the 1967 Daytona 24 Hours, this front-engine V12 GT was beautifully fast.\n\nIt managed 0-60 in about 5.4 seconds and could reach 174 mph, making it one of the fastest cars of its era.\n\nOften overshadowed by its bigger siblings, the Jalpa was Lamborghini's \"entry-level\" offering with a 3.5-liter V8.\n\nIt hit 60 mph in about 6.0 seconds but made up for it with a 155 mph top speed and classic wedge styling.\n\nMaserati's first mid-engine production car featured a 4.9-liter V8 designed by Giulio Alfieri.\n\nThe Bora could reach 60 mph in roughly the low to mid 6-second range, and period top speed figures are often quoted in the low to high 160 mph range depending on engine and test, which made it a worthy competitor to any modern pony car.\n\nThese classics remind us that speed isn't just about the latest technology: it's about engineering passion and pushing boundaries with the tools available at the time. While the 2026 Mustang GT benefits from decades of advancement in materials, aerodynamics, and electronics, these vintage performers achieved similar numbers with pure mechanical ingenuity.\n\nThe fact that cars from 40 to 50 years ago can still hang with modern muscle is a testament to the golden age of automotive performance.",

    "fullText": "Criminal gangs have stolen dozens of Toyota Land Cruisers and Prados worth $8 million in just the last six weeks in Australia. The vehicles were stolen in minutes without raising any warnings, using CAN Bus hacks, and were hidden inside shipping containers behind fake walls of car parts, destined for overseas markets like the United Arab Emirates. The top model types targeted by thieves include Toyota's Hilux, Land Cruiser 300, and Prado. It’s resulted in Toyota Australia responding to the increasing number of thefts with a low-tech solution: steering locks.\n\nThieves access the Controller Area Network through the headlight or tail light wiring, the communication system connecting all electronic control units in modern vehicles. Using devices disguised as Bluetooth speakers purchased on the dark web, criminals inject false messages into the network that trick vehicles into believing a genuine key fob is present. This disables the immobilizer and unlocks doors in under two minutes without needing the actual key. Unlike older relay attacks requiring proximity to real keys, CAN injection completely bypasses smart key systems by exploiting unencrypted communication networks inside the car.\n\nJames E. Winner Jr. invented The Club in 1986, a simple metal bar that locked onto steering wheels, making vehicles impossible to steer. The devices dominated the 1990s before electronic immobilizers made them seem obsolete. Now, Toyota has released its own version, selling through Australian dealerships for about $140 USD. Constructed from automotive-grade steel with four-point contact technology, Toyota's bright red lock aims to deter thieves through visibility. The company also promises additional security enhancements, including a new immobilizer, though details remain undisclosed to avoid tipping off criminals.\n\nHigh-tech hackers armed with custom electronics designed to exploit vehicle computer networks are being countered with essentially the same technology that protected pre-computer cars. While Toyota develops proper software fixes, owners must now manually attach a physical lock each time they park. The automotive industry's rush toward connectivity has created vulnerabilities that need old-fashioned solutions to address.",

    "title": "5 Cars With Transmissions That Are Basically Unbreakable",
    "description": "If your transmission needs repairs or worse, completely replaced, you are looking at hefty bills. Here are five cars with unbreakable transmissions.",
    "fullText": "When an engine fails, the loss is immediate, and usually very apparent via smoke, noise, and a loss of some or all power. When a transmission fails, however, it's much more subtle and insidious, starting with slipping gears, a jerk here, a shudder there. The next level up would be harsh shifts, culminating in no power being given to the wheels at all. Transmission repair bills are among the highest on cars, and for older vehicles, the cost of a transmission repair can exceed the value of the car (or truck) itself. That's why vehicles that have reliable transmissions are worth their weight in gold. Given that cars that have manual transmissions have been becoming rarer in recent years, all of the ones on this list are automatic units.\n\nHowever, the transmissions we list are all extraordinarily different from one another, sharing nothing but their reliability and durability in common, really. We avoided new cars, because we didn't have reliable data to prove longevity in those cases. Readers are requested to note that, obviously, not every vehicle that has the same transmission will also last the same miles; as there could be any number of differences between two vehicles that share the same transmission. The individual upkeep, maintenance, and climate of a used car will have a lot of bearing on how its transmission will hold up. It is always prudent to do in-depth research before making a purchase decision, and thoroughly inspect any pre-owned car before buying. With all that said, here are five cars that have unbreakable transmissions.\n\nWe kick things off with the first-generation Toyota Tacoma that ran from 1995 to 2004. Though Toyota had been making pickups before, the Tacoma was the first time the company named a model. The first gen Tacomas were available with three different engine choices that included a 2.4-liter four-banger, a 2.7-liter four-cylinder, and a 3.4-liter V6, with a couple different transmission options, including both manuals and automatics.\n\nWe specifically want to talk about the Aisin A340 transmission, which could be equipped to all three of those engines. The biggest V6 powerplant made an impressive 190 hp and 220 lb-ft of torque, and the first-gen was available in three cab configurations: double, access, and regular; with bed lengths of 5, 6, and 7 feet respectively. Regular cabs could also be had with a 6-foot bed. As far as the transmission itself goes, the A340 was a four-speed automatic gearbox that was first launched in 1985.\n\nThe gearbox shares Toyota's legendary reliability, because, well, Toyota actually owns Aisin, at least in part. As far as reliability goes, the Tacoma (as a whole) has a 25.3% chance of lasting until 250,000 miles, according to iSeeCars. This is more than five times the average vehicle's chance of reaching that mileage on the odo, which is all that needs to be said about the Aisin A340. The good news for prospective buyers is that even if an A340 transmission needs work, parts are cheap, and internet help is plentiful.\n\nMany people will have heard something along the lines of \"this car is equipped with a ZF transmission,\" and that's with good reason. What people don't realize is that ZF is actually a Germany-based company that designs transmissions, and then licenses that design to carmakers across the world. We daresay that ZF, which is an acronym for the company's full name, Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen, is one of the most popular transmission manufacturers in the world. The 2019 Dodge RAM 2500 is just one of many brands that happens to use an eight-speed automatic from ZF. We specifically included the RAM 2500 because it, too, ranks well in the iSeeCars study on vehicles likely to reach 250,000 miles, with a 17.3% probability of doing so.\n\nThat number is 1.3 times the average for the pickup truck segment, which is fairly impressive. Only the units that had the 6.4-liter Hemi engine as an option could be had with this gearbox, which is a shame, since it's one of the most reliable transmissions of all time. In fact, we've also listed a ZF eight-speed — which mechanics praise a lot –before, on our list of the best transmissions ever that were fitted to production cars. As things stand, the most recent RAM 2500 models are still available with an eight-speed box from ZF, albeit an updated version. It's worth noting that the RAM 1500 has actually been using the ZF eight-speed since 2013, but the 1500 ranks lower than the 2500 in the iSeeCars study.\n\nDodge has long been obsessed with making its muscle cars the most powerful ones on the market. But, with great power, comes great torque, and Dodge (which is now one of the many brands owned by Stellantis) had to come up with a gearbox that could handle all that oomph. Its solution for the 2015 models was to simply use an existing gearbox, which ended up being the 6060, manufactured by a company called Tremec. This same six-speed, RWD gearbox is also used in other high-performance models, such the Camaro ZL1 from Chevrolet. In both the Camaro ZL1 and the Challengers that are equipped with it, the Tremec 6060 is rated to handle 650 lb-ft of torque. At the root of it, the 6060 improved durability by just making a lot of components bigger, thicker, and more load-bearing.\n\nFor instance, some items on the 6060 that got larger (versus the old non-magnum T56) include the roller bearings on the input shafts, mainshaft, the teeth on the number three and four synchros, and the gear cogs themselves, among others. Interestingly, Tremec also markets a souped-up version of the 6060 as the T56 Magnum, which is likely an ode (but largely unrelated) to the T56 transmission that was used in the legendary Dodge Viper two decades ago. Additionally, readers should also note that the Challenger is not listed on the iSeeCars study, but for all the points we mentioned above, we decided to include it in our piece.\n\nWe're back to the kings of reliability, Toyota, with this next one, as it comes in the form of the Toyota 4Runner. It is one of their five mid-size SUVs –and, contrary to popular belief, Toyota only actually makes one full-size SUV, which is the Sequoia. Back to the 4Runner though; there have only been six distinct generations of 4runner since the model was introduced back in 1984, which really brings out the brand's \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" design philosophy. We specifically want to talk about the fourth and fifth generation 4runners, that ran from 2003 to 2024 — so, just over two decades — as these used the bulletproof A750 transmission.\n\nWhat many people might not realize is the fact that this box is also made by Aisin, who made the A340 that we introduced you to above. It makes sense — a very reliable car company will be expected to have very reliable transmissions, and Aisin seems to keep on delivering, at least according to owners on forums like Toyota-4runner.org. As far as the unit itself goes, the 750 is actually branded and produced by Toyota, which is an important distinction, as variants of the 750 are also used in cars from other companies, most notably, Suzuki and Mitsubishi. The Toyota A750s come in two variants, 2WD and 4WD, designated with the suffix of \"E\" and \"F\" respectively, with the most serious problem seemingly being a solenoid failure. The design was so robust that it later gave rise to a six-speed variant, called the AB60E, albeit with modifications.\n\nIt should surprise no one that the next vehicle on our list is another utility-focused one, in the form of the Ford Super Duty. We specifically want to focus on the 2011-2019 model years, as these were when the F-250 was shipping with the 6r140 transmission, made by Ford themselves. Note that there was another six-speed Ford Transmission known as the 6r80 (that was also pretty reliable, actually), though the 6r80 was intended for lighter-duty applications, such as in Transit vans and the F-150. Further, the 6r80 (and, unfortunately, the 6r140) would eventually be phased out in favor of a 10-speed transmission down the line, which had a slew of problems.\n\nAnd yes, the 6r140 was available in most of the Super Duty range from Ford, starting with the F-250, and going all the way up to the behemoth F-550. Given that vehicles from this range are intended to be workhorses, it's no surprise that Ford engineered these to last a long time. For instance, the 6r140 can handle over 1,000 pounds of torque, and has intelligent systems that downshift earlier when going downhill with a trailer.\n\nThat rugged engineering is probably a factor in the F-450 getting a 28.5% chance of reaching the 250,000-mile mark on the odometer, at least according to the same iSeeCars findings. That score is 2.2 times the average pickup truck's chance of reaching that mileage, and, interestingly, the F-150 actually performs half below the average, with just a 5.9% chance of reaching that mark.\n\nTo begin our research, we first shortlisted several reliable car models, and then looked into the transmissions that they had, and then, to whittle the list down, we did a few things. Say that we wanted to include a transmission named \"X\" on this list. First, we identified a model that carries that transmission, and looked it up on AutoTempest. If a large number of these cars were above 100-150k miles, that's checkbox one.\n\nSecond, we looked at the iSeeCars score for \"probability of reaching 250,000 miles.\" Third was to look at online sources, mainly garages and mechanic reviews, and some editorial reviews where they were available, preferably from authors who'd been hands-on with the cars. Where a large number of models had the same transmission, we chose to go with the most famous or the most sold one, as applicable.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "description": "Automotive and AI professionals share how to be a robotaxi tourist in China, including the apps to download and the best cities to ride in.",
    "fullText": "Intrigued by automated driving? Perhaps you've already tried one of the real Waymo or Zoox robotaxis in the United States. (Tesla's \"robotaxis\" probably don't count yet.)\n\nChina is the other real global hotspot for automated driving, with some of its biggest companies eager to expand around the world. Yet many people in the West — even many experts — don't really understand what's happening on China's streets. Often, we hear people simply claim that China is either way ahead or way behind.\n\nTogether, we have more than three decades of experience working on automated driving in industry and academia. Since meeting at Stanford University, we've collectively spent countless hours riding in Chinese as well as American robotaxis.\n\nWe wrote this piece to share our experiences in China and to help you plan — or even daydream — your own.\n\nPerhaps you'll marvel as your robotaxi skillfully navigates streets filled not just with cars but with bikes going every which way. Or you might sit sheepishly as it tries to turn itself around in a crowded intersection. You'll see some passersby who are shocked you're in a car without a driver, as well as others who are just annoyed you're in their way.\n\nIn other words, you'll encounter everyday people as they — and you — try to make sense of the robotaxis coming our way fast.\n\nHere's what we've learned about robotaxis in China on our (driverless) adventures, and here's how you can ride too.\n\nChina's three largest robotaxi developers are Baidu Apollo, Pony.ai, and WeRide. Each operates in China and is also pursuing services in other parts of the world, including Europe and the Middle East.\n\nBaidu Apollo is the automated driving unit of Baidu (BIDU on Nasdaq), often compared to Alphabet, which owns both Waymo and Google. You can get the Baidu Apollo Go app by searching for 萝卜快跑 in a Chinese app store. The first part of this name intentionally sounds like \"robot,\" but it actually means \"radish.\"\n\nPony.AI (PONY on Nasdaq) is a startup based in both China and the United States. You can get the PonyPilot app by searching for 小马智行 in a Chinese app store.\n\nWeRide (WRD on Nasdaq) is a startup that operates robotaxis, as well as automated shuttles along specific routes. You can get the WeRide Go app by searching for 文远知行 in a Chinese app store.\n\nThese companies differ in their approaches. For example, unlike many of its competitors, Baidu sometimes uses remote drivers rather than mere remote assistants. Perhaps as a result, Baidu already sends its robotaxis on some freeways without safety drivers inside. (Waymo only recently expanded its service to a few US freeways.)\n\nOther companies are also developing automated vehicles in China — but, at least in our experience, they tend to be active in very limited areas or still rely heavily on safety drivers.\n\nMany Chinese cities — including some megacities you may have never heard of — have at least some automated driving activity.\n\nIf you're coming in search of robotaxis, you can't go wrong with five of the more famous: Beijing (the capital), Shanghai (the financial hub), Wuhan (China's \"Chicago\"), and Guangzhou and Shenzhen (neighbors in the tech-heavy province of Guangdong near Hong Kong).\n\nWhereas Waymo's robotaxis can pick you up almost anywhere in San Francisco or Phoenix, you'll need to go find the robotaxis in Chinese cities. Services are generally confined to pilot zones covering only portions of each city, and an individual robotaxi company might provide truly driverless service in only part of a given pilot zone.\n\nThat said, comparisons are difficult: While Beijing's primary pilot zone may appear small, it is roughly similar in geographic size and population to all of San Francisco.\n\nBecause Baidu, Pony, and WeRide are all active here, Beijing provides a good introduction to Chinese robotaxis. Most of the capital's automated driving activity takes place in the southeastern Yizhuang area. (You'll know you're there when you see numerous automated vehicles marked with a BJHAD logo in the shape of a car.)\n\nVisit Yizhuang during the day — not during rush hours when services may pause or fill up, and not at night when they generally stop. Some robotaxi companies offer connections to and from South Railway Station and Daxing Airport, but these runs can be sporadic, may require advance booking, and currently use in-vehicle safety drivers.\n\nShanghai has several areas where, at least in theory, you can take a ride in a robotaxi. Remember that Shanghai is enormous; as in Beijing, you may need to travel by subway or taxi for an hour just to reach a robotaxi.\n\nPony serves a relatively small area east of Shanghai's famous central business district. From the CBD (or from the super-fast maglev train that serves Pudong Airport), head to Yunshun Road station. Yunshun Road is not Yunshan Road!\n\nIf you're near Hongqiao Airport (or its intercity rail station) on Shanghai's far west side, explore the various services in Jiading. We recommend a bus or taxi ride to Poly International Plaza to try out Baidu and Pony. Didi Rider (滴滴出行) and SAIC (上汽集团) also have limited operations nearby.\n\nLocals like to say that Baidu chose Wuhan because the city's human drivers are notoriously bad. At this point, the city's ubiquitous Apollo robotaxis probably offer China's best example of an automated vehicle service that ordinary commuters rely on. You can even get to and from the airport without a human at the wheel.\n\nAs with all the companies, there are caveats: You might be within Apollo's service area but not near one of its designated pick-up points, and some major destinations are still just out of reach. If you're already in the center, start at Hongtu Avenue station near Jinyingtan Hospital.\n\nSome of our more exciting robotaxi experiences (other than on Wuhan's freeways) were in Shenzhen and Guangzhou.\n\nMany \"robotaxis\" in these two cities actually had human safety drivers. And some of the vehicles that were driverless perhaps should not have been.\n\nShenzhen has officially opened the entire metropolis to robotaxis, but in practice, companies still serve only limited areas.\n\nGuangzhou has integrated automated shuttles into parts of its public transport network, which shows how automated mobility is more than just robotaxis.\n\nThe apps you'll use to book your robotaxi trips are both fun and frustrating. Most are available only in Chinese, so a screen translation app compatible with the Chinese internet is essential.\n\nSome apps won't show their robotaxis until you're physically in their service area. Some require you to manually set (and, crucially, to update) your desired service area in the settings; otherwise, they may incorrectly show no availability. And some let you choose between driverless and driver-supervised rides.\n\nAlternatively, the mapping apps Baidu Maps and Amaps each show their preferred robotaxi company if you're in a service area and you've toggled the robotaxi option. (Look for the Chinese term 无人车.)\n\nOnce you request a ride, some apps indicate your queue position. But if robotaxi service has been suspended due to weather or other reasons, a perpetual queue might be your only clue that your ride isn't coming.\n\nChina has recently loosened some of its travel restrictions. This means citizens of many European countries do not need travel visas for short visits.\n\nIf you're a US citizen, you do need to get a visa in advance — unless you're spending only a few days there on your way to somewhere else.\n\nCheck with your regional Chinese consulate, or turn to a commercial visa service. It's not onerous.\n\nYou'll need a mainland Chinese phone number to register for most robotaxi services — as well as to use many other Chinese apps that are linked to physical things in the real world. A foreign number, Hong Kong number, or data-only eSIM is unlikely to suffice.\n\nFortunately, once you arrive in China (and sometimes even in the airport), you can buy or rent a prepaid Chinese phone. Remember to bring your passport — and make sure you get an actual mainland number (+86 followed by 11 digits).\n\nYou can also ask the salesperson for the best app to translate your screen from Chinese to English. Remember that the Chinese internet is quite different from the internet you know. For example, even with a VPN, you might not be able to use any Google services.\n\nThe Western app stores for Apple and Android have international versions of major apps such as WeChat (for messaging and payments), Alipay (for payments and public transport), and Didi (for taxis). Beyond these basic functions, however, many of these apps (or the miniapps within them) may still require a Chinese phone number.\n\nOnce your robotaxi trip is underway, you can change your destination — though the number of times varies by provider.\n\nAs long as the app or in-vehicle screen lets you, this is a great way to spend more time in robotaxis rather than waiting for them.\n\nThis also shows how a company handles route changes. For example, Pony will quickly undertake U-turns (or even three-point turns), which can make for interesting maneuvers on already chaotic streets.\n\nIf all this sounds complicated, don't worry: The quirks of early robotaxis are part of the experience. China is becoming more accessible to foreigners, and some of the hurdles we've described may have even fallen by the time you visit.\n\nRegardless, the people you'll meet are almost always willing to help. Even if they don't speak English, they're impressively proficient with translation apps.\n\nAs with any trip, carefully consult travel guidance from your government. But if you'd like to be a robotaxi tourist, China should be high on your list. The country's robotaxis aren't perfect, but they're ahead of most of the world — and well worth the trip.\n\nBryant Walker Smith, a professor at the University of South Carolina and a visiting professor at Renmin University of China, studies the law and policy of AI generally and automated driving specifically.

    "fullText": "A wave of affordable Chinese-made EVs is accelerating the shift away from petrol cars, challenging long‑held assumptions about how transport decarbonisation unfolds\n\nDon’t get Down to Earth delivered to your inbox? \nLast year, almost every new car sold in Norway, the nature-loving country flush with oil wealth, was fully electric. In prosperous Denmark, which was all-in on petrol and diesel cars until just before Covid, sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) reached a share of 68%. In California, the share of zero-emissions vehicles hit 20%. And at least every third new car now bought by the Dutch, Finns, Belgians and Swedes burns no fuel.\n\nThese figures, which would have felt fanciful just five years ago, show the rich world leading the shift away from cars that pump out toxic gas and planet-heating pollutants. But a more startling trend is that electric car sales are also racing ahead in many developing countries. While China is known for its embrace of electric vehicles (EVs), demand has also soared in emerging markets from South America to south-east Asia. BEV sales in Turkey have caught up with the EU’s, data published this week shows.\n\nIs the electric car revolution finally entering the fast lane? Let’s take a look – after this week’s most important reads.\n\nThe Fukushima towns frozen in time: nature has thrived since the nuclear disaster but what happens if humans return?\n\nThe UK government didn’t want you to see this report on ecosystem collapse. I’m not surprised\n\nThe 16-month battle to reveal the truth about Sydney Water’s poo balls\n\nFor decades, climate progress has largely come from cleaning up the power sector. Burn gas instead of coal, or replace power plants with wind turbines or solar panels, and you can slash the amount of planet-heating gas spewed into the atmosphere for little cost.\n\nNow, early signs suggest transportation may be on the brink of delivering similar wins. EVs have quickly gained ground in markets outside Europe and North America, avoiding a rise in fuel-burning vehicles and “leapfrogging” the development path that richer countries have taken in transport.\n\n“Five years ago you might have thought [transportation] is really going to be a bottleneck [for climate progress],” says William Lamb, a scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. “But now with the widescale adoption of EVs, it’s looking a little bit easier.”\n\nThe EV race has gone global, according to a report (pdf) published last month by Ember, a climate thinktank, which looked at BEV and plug-in hybrid sales for the first 10 months of last year. It found 39 countries around the world have an electric sales share above 10%, up from just four countries (all in Europe) in 2019. Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam have overtaken the EU in their EV uptake. India, Mexico and Brazil have overtaken Japan.\n\n“It’s good news that we’re seeing growth in the EV market in more countries now,” said Robbie Andrew, a scientist who tracks electric vehicle sales at Cicero, a research centre in Oslo, the world’s EV capital. “In developing countries, this is largely about the recent arrival of much cheaper models from China. The Chinese companies have innovated extraordinarily quickly.”\n\nHalf of the cars registered in China last year were electric, and carmakers such as BYD have driven the boom in much of the global south. The Ember report found that three of the ten largest-value markets for Chinese EV exports are outside the OECD – Brazil, the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia – while the value of its exports to non-OECD countries and Mexico has tripled in the last two years.\n\nThe countries that benefit range from Ethiopia, which in 2024 became the first nation to ban imports of combustion engine cars, to Nepal, a polluted country scarred by a blockade 11 years ago that left it with severe petrol shortages. But it is not just the Chinese driving progress. Turkey’s share of BEV sales hit 17% last year – the same as the EU’s – in a transition led by domestic carmaker Togg. It has overtaken Tesla as the country’s leading supplier, with BYD in third place.\n\nThe question of whether to buy an electric vehicle has also been complicated by a culture war surrounding some of the brands that make them. Tesla has seen sales plummet across Europe and the US in response to Elon Musk’s support for far-right parties, and promotion of racist conspiracy theories. But in Turkey, the brand is viewed somewhat more favourably.\n\n“If you have a Togg in Turkey, some people think you are a government-lover and a political Islamist,” says Berke Astarcioğlu, an engineer from Istanbul and an early adopter of EVs. “But if you have a Tesla, you are seen as secular, educated and open-minded.”\n\nA challenge for developing countries seeking to sustain the EV boom is whether they can build charging infrastructure fast enough to avoid customer frustration. About two-thirds of the growth in public chargers since 2020 has occurred in China, which now has about 65% of the global charging stock, a report by the International Energy Agency found last year. But charging infrastructure in many other markets is lagging behind EV adoption rates.\n\nThere are also fears the surge in EVs may taper out as the rich customer base in lower- and middle-income countries is exhausted. New cars are generally bought by wealthier residents, while others buy theirs second-hand.\n\nStill, in places like Turkey and Thailand (to name two of many), where falling prices and rising subsidies bring the price of EVs in line with petrol cars, Andrew says the question of whether only the rich can afford them falls away. “With price parity, people buy the cars because they’re simply better and cost less to run.”\n\nIf that trend continues to spread around the world, we may soon see electric cars leave their fume-belching rivals in the dust.\n\nPowering up: how Ethiopia is becoming an unlikely leader in the electric vehicle revolution\n\n‘My Tesla has become ordinary’: Turkey catches up with EU in electric car sales\n\nThe electric vehicle revolution is still on course – don’t let your loathing of Elon Musk stop you joining up",

    "fullText": "Mercedes were pre-season favourites for 2026 long before any of the new cars ran on track, and nothing that happened in the Formula 1 'shakedown' in Spain this week has changed that.\n\nThe new Mercedes made a strong impression on rivals. The team did the most miles, and set the fastest times while the car was on the track, albeit Lewis Hamilton posted the quickest time of the week late on the final day in the Ferrari.\n\nThe seven-time champion's lap of one minute 16.348 seconds pipped George Russell's best for Mercedes, set the previous day, by 0.097 seconds. World champion Lando Norris was second fastest on the final day, and third overall, in the McLaren, 0.246secs off Hamilton.\n\nJudging performance from pre-season testing is always fiendishly difficult because of the number of variables involved, all the more so after a week such as this.\n\nThe test was held behind closed doors, with no independent media allowed access. No official timing was released. Only very few photographs were taken, and most of those were vetted by the teams who released them.\n\nThe test was exactly how it was billed - a shakedown is motorsport terminology for giving a car a first run-out to make sure everything works.\n\nOn top of that, everything the teams were using was new - cars, engines, tyres and fuel - after the biggest regulation change in the sport's history.\n\nTesting outright pace was very much not on the agenda for anyone. So the headline lap times meant almost nothing, not that that erases the general impression that Mercedes are in the best place at this early stage.\n\nThe test was all about learning about the new cars and, particularly, the new power-units. It was held in private because teams were scared by memories of the last time new engines were introduced, in 2014, when many suffered major reliability problems.\n\nBut those fears did not come to fruition, partly because the standards in F1 are so high these days, and partly because the technology change was not as big as last time. If anything, the engine technology, at least, is simpler.\n\nThe engines now have 50% of their total power produced by the electrical part of the hybrid engine, and will require much more energy management than ever before in F1.\n\nBut there is now only one hybrid element to the engine, albeit that it produces three times as much power, following the removal of the MGU-H, which recovered energy from the turbo and exhaust. This means lots of energy recovery, and optimising that for lap time will take plenty of learning.\n\nFully sustainable fuels, made from waste biomass or synthetic industrial processes, have added a new complication, as they burn differently from fossil fuel petrol.\n\nAs for the chassis, the cars have less downforce than last year, are smaller and narrower, but faster in a straight line, that speed boosted by moveable front and rear wings.",

    "description": "Hiking subscriptions, making robots, and selling fewer cars? Tesla is acting like a tech company in more ways than one.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has long insisted Tesla isn't a car company. After its latest earnings, it looks less like one than ever.\n\nThe billionaire told investors that Tesla would scrap its Model S and X EVs and convert their production lines to build the company's Optimus humanoid robot, as it continues to shift toward AI and robotics.\n\nTesla also said it had agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI and to evaluate \"potential AI collaborations\" with Musk's AI startup.\n\nIt came as the company's financial disclosures painted a stark picture of the troubles facing its EV business, which saw sales decline for the second year in a row in 2025.\n\nTesla beat Wall Street's expectations, but reported its first-ever decline in annual revenue and said profits fell by 46% last year, while revenue from car sales fell by 11% year-over-year in the last quarter.\n\nExecutives largely shrugged off the headwinds, with Musk and other top employees reiterating in the analyst Q&A their belief that autonomous vehicles will shortly render traditional forms of transport obsolete.\n\n\"The vast majority of miles traveled will be autonomous in the future,\" said Musk, in response to an investor question asking about Tesla's plans to launch new models.\n\n\"I'm just guessing, but probably less than 5% of miles driven will be where somebody's actually driving the car themselves in the future, maybe as low as 1%,\" he added.\n\nInvestors reacted positively, with Tesla shares rising around 3% after hours following earnings.\n\nThe reaction is another sign of how, for many investors, vehicle sales have become a sidenote to Tesla's future, as the company executes an ambitious shift toward a new business model built on robotics, AI, and software services.\n\n\"They're definitely moving away from an automotive-oriented company to a tech-oriented company,\" Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, told Business Insider prior to Tesla's earnings. '\"This is a company that's looking to get away from vehicle sales as the focus of their revenue.\"\n\nElon Musk has long said that Tesla should be thought of as an AI and robotics company, not a carmaker. Investors have agreed, driving Tesla's market cap to $1.35 trillion, more than every other US carmaker combined.\n\nEven before Tesla's latest AI-focused earnings, there were signs that the company had begun to act more like the tech giant Musk dreams of.\n\nThe company overhauled its autonomy offerings in recent weeks, removing the option to buy its premium Full Self-Driving software for a one-off fee of $8,000 and making it subscription-only.\n\nTesla also killed its basic Autopilot tier, which previously came free on almost all its vehicles, instead replacing it with a more limited form of cruise control. Musk also indicated in a post on X that Tesla owners can expect FSD prices to rise beyond the $99-per-month subscription fee as the technology improves.\n\nPhasing out free features and hiking subscription prices is classic tech giant behavior, and the moves quickly sparked backlash from Tesla fans and customers on social media. Analysts told Business Insider the changes were likely aimed at driving adoption of FSD and monetizing the existing user base.\n\n\"I think it's about monetizing FSD. I think they're going to look at more ways to monetize what I view as services, autonomous, and really disruptive technology within their installments,\" Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities and a longtime Tesla Bull, told Business Insider ahead of earnings.\n\nMusk has described FSD as crucial to Tesla's future, but the company has struggled to get drivers to pay for it. In October, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja told investors that just 12% of Tesla owners have bought FSD.\n\nOn Wednesday, Taneja said that 1.1 million customers had bought FSD, but added that nearly 70% of those purchases were upfront rather than subscription.\n\nBoosting FSD subscriptions is also a key milestone for Musk's $1 trillion pay package, which requires the company to hit 10 million active FSD subscriptions by 2035 for the Tesla CEO to unlock the full payout.\n\nThe most critical part of Tesla's transition to a tech company is its robotaxi and Optimus humanoid robot initiatives, which Musk has said will eventually make Tesla the world's most valuable company.\n\nTom Narayan, lead equity analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told Business Insider that nearly 75% of his long-term valuation of the company was based on robotics and autonomous vehicles, with just 8% coming from car sales. Ives put that figure at 80-90%, adding that he viewed Tesla as an \"autonomous and robotics company\" moving forward.\n\n\"That's why this is such a key transition year for Musk and Tesla. Any delays in autonomous or robotaxis are going to be heavily scrutinized because that's the key to the valuation,\" Ives added.\n\nTesla launched its robotaxi service in Austin last June, and recently began offering some public rides without a safety driver. However, its service in the Texan city is still small, with around 50 active vehicles, according to a community tracker run by Austin-based robotaxi watcher Ethan McKenna.\n\nMusk said on Wednesday that Tesla would have robotaxis operating in \"somewhere between a quarter and half\" of the US by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval, and the company is set to begin production on its dedicated Cybercab robotaxi in April.\n\nIves added that Tesla's focus this year would be on building out its robotaxi service, noting he didn't expect the company to begin collecting \"meaningful revenue\" from autonomous ride-hailing until 2027.\n\n\"It's important that they get into what I believe will probably be roughly about 30 cities this year. 2026 is the build-out of robotaxis, 2027 is where you'll start to see more monetization,\" Ives said.\n\nOnce Tesla's robotaxi service reaches escape velocity, Narayan said he expects it to transform the company's business model from a traditional carmaker into a high-margin services business more akin to Uber.\n\n\"It dramatically transforms the current auto business, which is a capital-intensive, low-margin business, into a high-margin, much higher revenue business,\" he said. \"The market is bigger and the economics are far better.\"\n\nExecuting that transition will be expensive. Taneja, Tesla's CFO, said on Wednesday that the company expects to spend more than $20 billion this year on new production lines and AI compute infrastructure.\n\nFor Tesla's beleaguered EV business, things look unlikely to improve anytime soon.\n\nAlthough Tesla continues to dominate the electric vehicle market in the US, the end of the $7,500 tax credit in September has caused that market to slow dramatically, with rivals Ford and GM canceling electric models and taking billions of dollars in charges amid warnings of an EV winter.\n\nOutside of the US, Tesla is losing market share to Chinese carmakers such as BYD, which now dominate China's booming EV market and are growing rapidly in Europe and the rest of the world.\n\nAutoForecast Solutions' Fiorani said that Tesla ran the risk of a bumpy transition period if its carmaking business declined faster than its robotaxi and services businesses could grow. However, he added that the company may have no choice but to make the leap.\n\nHe pointed to the competition from China and declining income from the regulatory credits that Tesla sells to automakers who have failed to sell enough EVs as evidence that the company's automotive business was running out of road.\n\n\"Musk sees the future of this business as robots and autonomous vehicles,\" Fiorani said.\n\n\"The physical products themselves, the cars and the automotive side, are all legacy products,\" he added. \"We're going to see them going forward to autonomous software, autonomous hardware, things that will move them into the next generation.\"",

There were no other riders inside the car.\n\nThe driver exited the vehicle on his own following the crash, the spokesperson added.\n\nWhile Waymo's robotaxis are designed to operate without a human driver, the company still uses manual driving in certain situations, including software testing and training.\n\nIn some cases, trained specialists sit in the driver's seat to \"monitor our autonomous driving technology,\" Waymo said on its FAQ page.\n\nWaymo began operating a driverless ride-hailing service in Phoenix in 2018 and has since expanded to other cities, including Austin and Atlanta, through a partnership with Uber.\n\nThe company launched driverless vehicles in San Francisco in 2022 and began offering rides to the public through its app in 2024.\n\nThe crash comes as Waymo faces increased scrutiny over the safety of its autonomous vehicles.\n\nLast month, several Waymo robotaxis stalled in intersections and along busy streets in San Francisco during a power outage. A clip on X showed at least five driverless vehicles clustered at a junction, backing up traffic.\n\nThe California Public Utilities Commission told Business Insider in December it is \"looking into specifics\" of the outage incident.\n\nIn May, Waymo recalled software affecting more than 1,200 vehicles after some slammed into chains or gates. Business Insider reported in November that a Waymo vehicle ran over a bodega cat in San Francisco, sparking backlash from residents.",

    "fullText": "Popularity of EVs in country is part of global trend of emerging markets spurning fossil fuel cars at surprising speeds\n\nWhen Berke Astarcıoğlu bought a BMW i3 in 2016, he was one of just 44 people in a country of 80 million to buy a battery electric vehicle (BEV) that year. By the time he bought a Tesla in 2023, BEVs were no longer a complete oddity in Turkey, making up 7% of new car sales.\n\nFast-forward two years and electric cars are selling so fast that Turkey has caught up with the EU in its rate of adoption. Its market is now the fourth largest in Europe, behind Germany, the UK and France.\n\n“A premium product is a thing that makes you happy but that not everyone can have,” said Astarcıoğlu, a mechatronic engineer from Istanbul and the developer of an app to find charging stations. “My Tesla has become an ordinary car over here.”\n\nBEVs made up 16.7% of new car sales in Turkey in 2025, just behind the EU’s 17.4%, registration data published on Tuesday shows. While uptake is lower than in the Netherlands or the Nordics, where BEVs make up 35% to 96% of new cars sold, sales in Turkey have raced ahead of almost every country in southern and eastern Europe.\n\nIts electric vehicle surge is part of a global trend in which emerging markets from Uruguay to Vietnam are spurning fossil fuel-burning cars at surprising speed. The latest data comes as Turkey prepares to host the UN climate summit, and one month after the EU watered down its 2035 ban on new combustion engine cars.\n\nAnalysts attribute the boom to a disparity in Turkey’s special consumption tax, which has left electric cars only slightly more expensive than comparable petrol cars. Sales remained high even after the government raised taxes on electric vehicles in August.\n\n“Practically speaking, Turkish people don’t buy electric vehicles because it’s eco-friendly,” said Ufuk Alparslan, an analyst at the climate thinktank Ember, saying that running costs were lower for electric cars. “The motivation is purely economical.”\n\nElectrifying car fleets is seen as a crucial step to decarbonising the transport sector and reducing pollution, but efforts in many regions have run into roadblocks. In the EU, where planet-heating emissions from cars have risen by 17% since 1990, attempts to phase out combustion engines have been met with fierce resistance from the automobile industry.\n\nThe Turkish government does not have a dedicated electric vehicle strategy but has championed a domestic carmaker, Togg, which in 2024 overtook Tesla as the country’s leading EV seller. In an interview with Bloomberg HT last week, Togg’s board chair, Fuat Tosyalı, announced plans to increase production from 40,000 cars in 2025 to 60,000 in 2026.\n\nTogg’s entry into the market, which was buoyed up by tax support and zero-interest credit from state-owned banks, has helped normalise electric vehicle adoption, said Berkan Bayram, the founder of the Turkish Electric and Hybrid Vehicles Association. “It gained the heart of Turkish buyers.”\n\nForeign carmakers who must contend with import duties have benefited from the Togg-friendly tax system, with manufacturers including Tesla reducing motor power in Turkey to fall into the same favourable tax bracket. China’s BYD is also jostling for a greater share of the market and plans to build a $1bn factory in Turkey.\n\nIn addition to the environmental benefits of displacing fossil fuel vehicles, the transition to electric mobility could be a geopolitical boon for countries that do not produce oil themselves. Turkey’s car fleet is expected to quadruple in size by 2053, sending demand for oil imports soaring, according to a report by InstitutDE, a Turkish diplomatic thinktank in Brussels.\n\nWhile imports will rise in all scenarios studied, a failure to run more cars on electricity would heighten Turkey’s exposure to external shocks, price volatility and geopolitical risks, the report found.\n\nHowever, the recent increase in BEV sales may not herald a systemic shift away from fossil fuel cars. The tax incentives are “very fragile” and can change easily, said Baki Kaya, an economist and former diplomat who co-wrote the InstitutDE report.\n\n“It’s not the result of a strategic decision,” he said. “And I’m personally not that optimistic [it will continue].”\n\nAnalysis from Ember found the overall tax burden on electric cars remained high, with the total tax applied to electric cars in the lowest bracket reaching 50%, and rising to 86% in a higher bracket. Without changes, inflation and exchange rates could soon shrink the number of affordable BEVs, Alparslan said.\n\n“Although electric cars have started to become widespread in Turkey, there is still a large, untapped potential to reduce energy imports through renewable energy and electric vehicles,” he said. “Tax policies that keep electric vehicle prices at more affordable levels could accelerate this momentum.”",

    "description": "The Aircela acts like a mini direct air capture facility, sucking up carbon dioxide and then synthesizing it into real, usable gasoline for cars.",
    "fullText": "In 2022, transportation was responsible for an estimated 28 percent of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The majority of those emissions came from everyday gas-powered cars. And while electric vehicles have been heralded as a greener alternative, decades of advocacy and hundreds of billions of dollars in investment have yielded meager results.\n\nToday, electric cars make up just around 8 percent of all vehicles on U.S. roads. (Roughly 90 person of vehicles globally still run on fossil fuels.) Most EVs remain prohibitively expensive for the majority of Americans, and they require enormous amounts of critical minerals—resources that, when extracted at scale, pose their own environmental dilemmas. Most Americans also still just aren’t interested in ditching their gas guzzlers to save the planet.\n\nBut what if they didn’t have to?\n\nThat’s the alluring—if wildly ambitious—vision being presented by New York–based fuels startup Aircela. Earlier this month, the company announced it had created the world’s first functional machine capable of generating real, usable car gasoline “directly from the air.” Aircela’s new device, roughly the size of a commercial refrigerator, combines direct air capture (DAC) with on-site fuel synthesis to create gasoline using just air, water, and renewable energy. No fossil fuels, they say, are required.\n\nThe product their device produces can be poured directly into the tank of any standard gas-powered car. Aircela demonstrated the process, making gasoline directly from air, in front of a live audience in New York. Though most would describe this proof of concept as a “prototype,” company co-founder and CEO Eric Dahlgren takes some umbrage with that label.\n\n“We didn’t build a prototype. We built a working machine,” Dahlgren said in a statement. “We want people to walk away knowing this isn’t too good to be true—it actually works.”\n\nAircela’s device essentially functions as a compact, portable direct carbon capture facility (DAC) unit. Carbon capture generally refers to the practice of removing carbon dioxide from sources like smokestacks or fossil fuel power plants. Direct air capture, the approach used by Aircela, pulls CO₂ directly from the atmosphere. Europe currently has more than a dozen DAC facilities in operation, and the U.S. federal government is also investing in the technology. Some facilities, such as those run by Climeworks, use large fan-like machines to filter carbon dioxide from the air. Others, like those developed by Carbon Engineering, use chemical mists that bind with CO₂ to extract it. Some researchers are even exploring methods to capture carbon dioxide from the oceans. In most of these cases, the aim is to capture and store the harmful greenhouse gas. Aircela wants to recycle it into cars.\n\nAircela claims its device captures carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere and then converts it into gasoline. The resulting fuel doesn’t contain sulfur, ethanol, or heavy metals. Photos of the machine shared by the company show a device composed of three large blue hexagonal units—two side by side on the bottom and one stacked on top. These separate sections handle the stages of air capture and fuel synthesis. On the back of the machine is a standard-looking gasoline nozzle, similar to what you’d find at a gas station. In theory, someone could install one of these units outside their home and use it to refuel their vehicle before heading out for the day. More importantly, it suggests drivers could potentially reduce their environmental impact without needing to change their daily habits.\n\nA spokesperson from Aircela told Popular Science that their machine is designed to capture 10 kgs of CO₂ each day. From that, it can produce 1 gallon of gasoline. The machine can store up to 17 gallons of fuel in its tank. For context, a Toyota Tacoma’s fuel tank has a capacity of 21.1 gallons. In other words, at least in its current form, the device wouldn’t be capable of filling up a car’s tank with gas overnight. The spokesperson didn’t comment on the device’s precise cost but noted that “affordability is essential” to the company’s mission. Aircela is designing the device for mass production, which they believe will drive down costs over time.\n\nThe company reportedly wants to start manufacturing the machine by the fall with an interest in targeting a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial customers.\n\nThe most obvious downside to an approach like this compared to a larger, industrial-scale DAC facility, is sheer impact. A single device, on its own, won’t make a meaningful dent in reducing carbon emissions. But Aircela believes its relatively small size actually makes it less costly and faster to deploy at scale. CEO Eric Dahlgren says the compact form factor gives the technology the flexibility to scale down for individual car owners or scale up for larger clients, such as gas stations or even cargo shipping containers.\n\n“We truly believe that our approach is the fastest way to bring carbon neutral fuels to as many people as possible, to as many places as possible, as soon as possible,” Dahlgren said in a statement.\n\nOf course, that vision also depends entirely on the continued expansion and viability of renewable energy sources. If an Aircela machine uses electricity from a grid powered by natural gas, then not much has really been achieved in terms of carbon reduction. In the U.S., the trend toward renewable energy is strong, though notably less so under the current presidential administration, which has openly embraced the motto“drill baby drill.” Still, Dahlgren says it’s important to approach carbon reduction and environmentalism with a broad perspective and a sense of urgency.\n\n“We cannot wait decades,” Dahlgren added “we need to do something about it right now.”\n\nUpdate, May 28, 2025, 4:23pm ET: This story has been updated to include comments from an Aircela spokesperson.\n\nCorrection, May 29, 2025, 10:09am ET: An earlier version of this story listed the incorrect amount of CO₂ captured per day. It has been updated and we regret the error.",

India's commerce ministry and the European Commission declined to comment.\n\nPACT ALREADY DUBBED 'MOTHER OF ALL DEALS'\n\nIndia and the EU are expected to announce on Tuesday the ⁠conclusion of protracted negotiations for the free trade ‌pact, after which the two sides will finalise the details and ratify what is being called \"the mother of all deals.\n\nThe pact could expand bilateral trade and lift Indian exports of goods such as textiles and jewellery, which ‍have been hit by 50% U.S. tariffs since late August.\n\nIndia is the world's third-largest car market by sales after the U.S. and China, but its domestic auto industry has been one of the most protected. New Delhi currently levies tariffs of 70% and 110% on imported cars, a level often criticised by executives, ​including Tesla chief Elon Musk.\n\nNew Delhi has proposed slashing import duties to 40% immediately for about 200,000 combustion-engine cars a year, one ‌of the sources said, its most aggressive move yet to open up the sector. This quota could be subject to last-minute changes, the source added.\n\nBattery electric vehicles will be excluded from import duty reductions for the first five years to protect investments by domestic players like Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors in the nascent sector, the two sources said. After five years EVs will follow similar duty cuts.\n\nMARKET CURRENTLY DOMINATED BY SUZUKI AND LOCAL MAKERS\n\nLower import taxes will be a boost for European automakers such as Volkswagen, Renault and Stellantis, as well as luxury players ⁠Mercedes-Benz and BMW which locally manufacture cars in India but have struggled to grow ​beyond a point in part due to high tariffs.\n\nLower taxes will allow carmakers to ​sell imported vehicles for a cheaper price and test the market with a broader portfolio before committing to manufacturing more cars locally, said one of the two sources.",

    "fullText": "Officials in the United Kingdom have escalated a crackdown on illegal car exhaust modifications, issuing steep fines and setting a new legal precedent aimed at curbing excessively loud, polluting vehicles.\n\nAccording to Car Magazine, the latest case centers on so-called \"pop and bang\" exhaust systems. These are engine-tuning modifications designed to create explosive cracking noises that have become a frequent source of complaints in residential neighborhoods.\n\nThe ruling follows enforcement action by the U.K.'s Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency, which secured a conviction against a car tuning company for fitting an illegal exhaust and engine control unit remap.\n\nThe shop was fined about £5,800 ($7,790) after investigators found that the modified vehicle exceeded legal noise limits and failed basic roadworthiness standards.\n\nJudges ruled that tuning companies now carry a \"heavy burden\" to ensure vehicles modified for off-road use are not driven on public streets. That means cars made illegal by exhaust or emissions changes must leave a shop on a trailer and cannot be driven home.\n\nWhile the noises such engines make are annoying, that's not the only reason for this ruling. Excessive exhaust noise often goes hand in hand with increased air pollution, especially when catalytic converters or mufflers are removed.\n\n\"Everyone knows that horrific sound, when exhausts go pop and bang in the street, and cracking down on companies that fit these modifications shows our commitment to ensuring that Britain's roads remain among the safest in the world,\" U.K. Roads Minister Guy Opperman said after the ruling.\n\nDrivers themselves could also feel the impact. Authorities are testing roadside \"noise cameras\" that automatically flag vehicles exceeding legal sound limits. Police already have the power to issue on-the-spot fines, and officials say broader rollout is likely if trials prove effective.\n\nSimilar enforcement actions have taken place in the United States. In one high-profile case, COBB Tuning was hit with nearly $3 million in penalties by the Environmental Protection Agency for selling tens of thousands of illegal exhaust \"defeat devices.\"\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, those devices disabled emissions controls and caused dangerous levels of smog-forming pollution.\n\nTaken together, these crackdowns signal growing momentum to protect communities from unnecessary noise and dirty air.\n\nWould you buy a $10K car from China?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "title": "F1 cars need \"a diet\" – why the FIA will resist team demands on minimum weight",
    "description": "The minimum weight of a Formula 1 car for 2026 has been reduced by 32kg",
    "fullText": "The FIA will not comply with the demands of Formula 1 teams to increase the minimum car weight for 2026 - stressing that the championship needs a “diet”.\n\nF1 will introduce a new set of regulations for the forthcoming campaign and one area of change is the car chassis, with the minimum weight reducing from 800kg to 768kg.\n\nIt is a drastic change and thus expected to be an early development battlefield, particularly because there are concerns that many teams will not meet the requirement in early 2026 - per Williams boss James Vowles.\n\n\"Most will be overweight\" - Why drastic 2026 F1 targets still weigh on teams\n\nBut the FIA is adamant it will stick to its principles to combat years of bloat for F1 cars, as teams would search for increased performance and safety. Since 2010, for example, the minimum weight has increased by 180kg.\n\nSo, speaking to Motorsport at the Autosport Business Exchange: London, FIA single-seater director Nikolas Tombazis said: “We would like to put Formula 1 on a diet. It's going from obese to overweight and we need to push a bit more for the future.\n\n“We were quite adamant that we are not going to be tweaking the weight on team demand, we feel there's a bit of - like a diet - it needs a bit of discipline and a bit of pressure to achieve.\n\n“What has happened in previous pre-regulation cycles is that teams design systems on the car that of course improve performance - not essential for the functioning of the car, but are systems that just make the car incrementally better and there's a lot of systems.\n\n“If you look at the Formula 1 car, there's a massive plethora of such devices or designs that make a current car sort of 50 times more complicated than 20 years ago.\n\n“So, a lot of these systems crop up on the car, and then teams then say, ‘well, our car is five kilograms overweight, should we increase the weight?’\n\n“We've in the past been a bit more flexible on that and tried to comply. This year we said, ‘no, this is the limit, that's what you need to work to’ and to the best of our knowledge, there are teams who are slightly underweight, so it is entirely feasible.\n\n“Teams need to be very careful when they design a system, they need to say, ‘that system is going to gain us X amount of lap time’, it's going to weigh an extra kilo and a half, is it worth it? They need to make this decision a bit more consciously.”\n\nThe FIA is, in fact, so committed to overcoming the modern bulkiness of F1 cars that the governing body does not plan on stopping at 768kg, regardless of the challenge it presents.\n\n“Weight does contribute to the nimble car concept, we would love it to go down further in the future and I'm confident we will go a lot further,” added Tombazis.\n\n“It's been going up in the last 20 years or so, mainly because of a combination of factors: one is safety, the cars are a lot safer of course, and we certainly would never compromise and go back on that, but many kilos of the car are safe.\n\n“Then, of course all the sustainable power units, batteries and turbos, these also contribute and car dimensions contribute as well - so broadly these three factors.”\n\nWhat to expect from F1's Barcelona test – and why the first 2026 shakedown is being held in secret\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "Most people dream about winning the lottery. But for one 29-year-old man, his $15 million windfall came with a side of guilt, entitlement, and a family-sized headache.\n\nIn a post shared on Reddit, the anonymous winner explained that his financial plans were anything but reckless. He didn't run off to buy yachts or sports cars. Instead, he wanted to take business and finance courses, manage his newfound wealth responsibly, and eventually give back through charitable work. What he didn't plan for? His parents demanding a full quarter of the winnings—roughly $3.75 million—because, in their words, \"we raised you.\"\n\nThe Reddit post made clear this wasn't a close-knit family cashing in on shared joy. The man described his upbringing as \"distant white middle class,\" saying he had moved an hour away from his \"oppressive mother and distant father.\" While he described his sisters as \"nice people,\" he noted they don't have a real relationship.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nSam Altman Says AI Will Transform the Economy — This Platform Lets Investors Back Private Tech Early\n\nDespite this, when he won the lottery, he offered to pay off his parents' mortgages and provide them a cash gift. But when they learned the full scope of his winnings, that wasn't enough. \"Once they found the total amount,\" he wrote, \"they expected a quarter of it.\"\n\nThe conversation escalated. When his mother said, \"we raised you,\" he couldn't help but remember the five-year stretch—from age 15 to 20—when his parents completely cut off contact. Though he didn't directly confront them with that memory, he now questions whether he owes them anything at all.\n\nMany Redditors agreed that his parents were being unreasonable, entitled, and opportunistic. One user summed it up sharply: \"You don't owe them s**t.\"\n\nAnother commenter laid out a detailed legal and financial checklist: hire a lawyer and financial adviser, draw up a will and living trust, create powers of attorney for medical and financial decisions, and install a home security system. They ended their comment with a blunt mantra: \"People get crazy with money.\"\n\nTrending: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nAnd they weren't alone in that warning. Multiple users emphasized the need for protection—not just from scammers or strangers, but from family members who might be willing to sue, manipulate, or guilt-trip to access the prize. One even suggested freezing the winnings in a trust for a year just to let emotions cool and see how people behave.\n\nStill, not everyone was entirely unsympathetic to the family's reaction. From a devil's advocate angle, some might say parents who supported their child for nearly two decades—through diapers, meals, and housing—might feel hurt or excluded if they're only offered a slice instead of a share.\n\nBut that perspective hinges on a relationship that doesn't seem to exist in this case. The man's post didn't reveal abuse or violence, but the emotional neglect—especially during his formative years—cast a long shadow. Five years of silence from his parents left a mark. And now, with millions on the table, old wounds are reopening under the glare of entitlement.\n\n\"I feel like I've been as generous as I can be,\" he said, noting he never explicitly said so to his parents, but assumed it would be clear. What stung most was that their reaction didn't reflect pride or joy—it reeked of resentment that they didn't get more.\n\nSee Also: Private-Market Real Estate Without the Crowdfunding Risk—Direct Access to Institutional-Grade Deals Managed by a $12B+ Real Estate Firm\n\nThe original poster has since emailed his parents to reiterate his offer and state firmly that nothing more would be coming. Whether they respond, and how, remains to be seen.\n\nIn a later update, he stressed that this situation wasn't about seeking revenge or proving a point. It was about maintaining boundaries and protecting the life he's worked hard to rebuild. \"I am not looking to be told how to spend my money or how to be vindictive,\" he wrote. \"They do love me, even if it's in their own sad way.\"\n\nAnd maybe that's the hardest part. Winning the lottery can change your bank account—but it doesn't fix broken relationships. The man walked away with $15 million, but in doing so, he discovered that family ties can fray under the weight of expectation. And in his case, no amount of money seems likely to stitch them back together.\n\nRead Next: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

    "description": "Online insurance firm Lemonade said it would offer a policy designed specifically for self-driving cars, starting with Tesla.",
    "fullText": "Tesla's car sales may have struggled recently, but Morgan Stanley says a recent update in the insurance space is a positive signal for the real bull case for Tesla stock: autonomous driving.\n\nOnline insurance provider Lemonade announced the launch of a new product for self-driving cars this week. The Lemonade Autonomous Car insurance will begin with a 50% rate cut for Tesla drivers when their vehicle's autonomous driving software is in control.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts say this is a \"critical unlock\" for Tesla and the broader self-driving car market. It indicates that insurance providers may finally be gaining confidence in autonomous technology.\n\nOne of the largest hurdles to autonomous driving has been insurance providers' reluctance. High uncertainty regarding liability and risk has prompted many companies to avoid insuring vehicles with autonomous capabilities.\n\nLemonade's decision to start ensuring Tesla vehicles equipped with the tech might mark a breakthrough, Morgan Stanley said.\n\n\"This is an important shift in how insurers treat advanced driver-assistance and autonomy features,\" he said. \"Lemonade's approach suggests growing confidence in the data coming from Tesla's fleet, using real-world driving outcomes to assess safety performance rather than relying solely on theoretical or regulatory classifications.\"\n\nWhile Lemonade's announcement is specific to Tesla cars for now, the EV leader is seen as a bellwether for the autonomous driving industry. Percoco added that he expects more companies to follow Lemonade and start insuring self-driving cars.\n\n\"Lemonade's announcement points toward a future in which insurance becomes one of the clearest market-based validators of autonomous driving progress,\" he wrote.\n\nWith Tesla's electric vehicle sales down for two consecutive years, Elon Musk is betting big on autonomous driving, and investors see the technology as the primary justification for the stock's premium valuation. More accessible insurance could hasten the adoption of autonomous driving tech.\n\n\"As insurers incorporate increasingly granular driving data into pricing, technologies that demonstrably reduce risk should be rewarded faster and more transparently,\" he noted. \"For Tesla, this marks another step toward external recognition that FSD is moving from an experimental feature to an economically relevant safety system.\"",

    "description": "Enterprise Rent-A-Car is the latest company to find itself facing backlash amid anti-ICE protests in Minnesota.",
    "fullText": "Enterprise is the latest company caught in the crosshairs of anti-ICE protests.\n\nA video showing protesters lined up outside of a Minnesota Enterprise Rent-A-Car location went viral earlier this week on TikTok, part of an \"Ice out Enterprise\" protest campaign.\n\nOrganizers encouraged participants to disrupt Enterprise's operations by reserving rental cars and then canceling the bookings shortly before pickup — a tactic they say is designed to draw attention and strain vehicle availability that could be utilized by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.\n\n\"Enterprise is renting cars to ICE agents and profiting from the violence that agents are bringing to our communities,\" Minnesota organizers associated with the Sunrise Movement, a progressive climate and social justice advocacy group, posted on social media. The post asked protestors to \"please be polite to employees when you contact them.\"\n\nbrought the workers donuts too- it’s not them we’re protesting, it’s corporate policy that requires them to rent to kidnappers! hint: you can do this at your local enterprise too… #minneapolis #minnesota #ice #protest\n\nAn Enterprise employee working the counter at one of the rental car company's Saint Paul, Minnesota, locations confirmed to Business Insider on Friday that protesters had been calling the store. The employee declined to comment further, citing the company's media policy.\n\n\"I've called and told them I was disappointed that they were collaborating with ICE,\" a commenter on Instagram said.\n\n\"They answered the phone super quickly,\" another added. \"I was told a complaint would be logged right away.\"\n\nThe viral video, which was posted on Thursday, had more than 323,000 views on TikTok as of publication. It shows a line of demonstrators holding signs reading \"No cars for ICE\" and \"Cancel ICE contracts now.\"\n\nIt's unclear if Enterprise has any contract with ICE. Enterprise did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe effort is part of a \"week of actions\" in Minnesota leading up to a \"business blackout\" on Friday to protest ICE's presence in the state. The Sunrise and Sunrise Twin Cities groups didn't respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nA post shared by Sunrise Movement - Twin Cities Hub (@sunrise.twincities)\n\nThe video has also drawn reactions from conservative commentators on X.\n\n\"Anti-ICE leftists are now booking and canceling car reservations at Enterprise to protest them renting cars to ICE,\" wrote Chaya Raichik, who operates the popular Libs of TikTik account on X, in a post with more than 208,000 views.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Business Insider in a statement that \"dangerous\" protest efforts had led to a rise in violence against ICE officers. \"ICE officers act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism,\" she said.\n\nEnterprise is the latest major corporation to face consumer pressure as immigration enforcement activity in Minnesota has drawn widespread protest.\n\nEarlier this month, Hilton removed a franchisee from its portfolio after a video that purported to show a hotel employee refusing to provide immigration enforcement officers rooms.\n\nIn a statement, the hotel chain criticized the operator and said its corporate policy was to make all locations \"a welcoming place for all\" and that it does \"not discriminate against any individuals or agencies.\"\n\nMinneapolis-based Target has also faced heat from activists who accused the retailer of cooperating with immigration officials. The retailer denied those claims an internal memo obtained by Business Insider.\n\n\"Target does not have cooperative agreements with any immigration enforcement agency,\" human resources chief Melissa Kremer wrote to employees. \"We're listening and working to de-escalate where possible.\"\n\nEnterprise, which runs around two dozen locations in the Twin Cities, is still facing calls from Minnesota-based protestors.",

The livery unveiled by General Motors President Mark Reuss is a temporary testing scheme that will be used exclusively during the series shakedown later this month at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya in Spain.\n\nPeople Question Just How Authentic Cadillac Barn Find Really Is…\n\nThe shakedown is scheduled for January 26 through January 30 and serves as the team’s first official on-track activity ahead of its debut season. While the design introduces Cadillac’s visual identity to Formula 1, it is not representative of the final appearance fans will see during competition. The full-season liveries for Cadillac’s two-car entry are set to be revealed February 8 during the Super Bowl broadcast.\n\nThe unveiling took place as part of General Motors’ opening-week events at its new headquarters inside Detroit’s Hudson’s building. A full-scale replica Formula 1 car wearing the testing livery was included in the display and is scheduled to remain on public view at the Detroit Auto Show through January 25.\n\nAccording to Cadillac, the testing livery was designed to balance brand expression with the practical demands of pre-season development. In Formula 1, early-session liveries are commonly used to obscure aerodynamic details while teams gather data and refine performance. Cadillac’s design uses a restrained color palette and geometric elements intended to visually mask bodywork while still signaling the brand’s arrival on the global stage. A prominent Cadillac crest is positioned toward the rear of the car, while vertical patterning across the body adds visual depth and serves a functional purpose during testing.\n\nA notable design detail is the inclusion of the names of the team’s founding members from both the United States and the United Kingdom, which appear on the nose of the car as a nod to the international effort behind the program.\n\nCadillac will join the Formula 1 grid as the championship’s 11th team, fielding veteran drivers Sergio Perez and Valtteri Bottas. The organization has also named former Sauber racer Zhou Guanyu as its reserve driver. Former IndyCar driver Colton Herta has moved to Formula 2, positioning himself as a potential future American addition to the Cadillac Formula 1 lineup.",

    "fullText": "Even before the new cars are on the track, Mercedes and Red Bull have already stirred up controversy among their rivals ahead of the 2026 Formula One season.\n\nWith new technical regulations on the horizon, there’s plenty of speculation about how the grid will shake out. Some teams have already put components through early tests ahead of the official shakedown in Barcelona at the end of January.\n\nNobody really knows where things stand yet, but there are already whispers that a couple of teams might be a step ahead. Reports suggest that Mercedes and Red Bull may have found a “loophole” in the engine regulations for 2026.\n\nThe FIA has set a compression ratio limit of 16:1 during operation, but it’s believed Mercedes and Red Bull have managed to increase this to 18:1, giving them extra horsepower over their rivals.\n\nThis hasn’t gone down well with Ferrari, Honda and Audi – especially with talk that Mercedes may already hold an early advantage in power unit performance for 2026. While those three manufacturers might be playing catch-up now, they aren’t expected to stay behind for long.\n\nFinding gaps in the rulebook isn’t new in Formula 1. Back in 2009, Brawn GP, Williams, and Toyota all gained an edge with their double diffuser design. Rather than outlawing it straight away, the FIA made it legal, and soon enough, every team had adopted the approach.\n\nThe FIA are wary of letting one team pull too far ahead for commercial reasons. Journalist Julianne Cerasoli believes Mercedes and Red Bull’s latest advantage will eventually be closed off.\n\n“Look, I believe so,” Cerasoli said when asked if the trick would be banned on her YouTube channel. “I believe that this is the kind of solution that Formula 1 will find. Some people asked: ‘Isn’t it unfair?’ No, it’s not unfair.\n\n“It’s what happened; it’s the pure essence of Formula 1. The FIA have already given me a hint, saying: ‘Look, someone read something in the regulations that wasn’t what we wrote.’\n\nShe added: “Why do I say that the environment is such that this will be banned over time? I don’t know when they come to some kind of agreement because absolute dominance is very bad commercially for Formula 1.\n\n“Today there is this notion: ‘OK I want to win but I want everyone else to win because if everyone wins my piece of pie will get even bigger.’ Let’s increase the pie for everyone because my piece of pie will get bigger if that happens.”\n\nWith the loophole, it’s no surprise other teams are raising questions about whether Mercedes and Red Bull are playing within the rules. Their power units could end up giving their customers a real edge over the competition.\n\nThe leading theory is that Red Bull has found a way to move their piston closer to the cylinder head. Even so, technical director Ben Hodgkinson insists everything they’re doing is above board.\n\nFerrari are rumoured to be preparing a protest ahead of the season opener in Melbourne. Testing will reveal just how big – or small – that gap really is.\n\nWhat Cadillac have said to Ferrari about their 2026 F1 engine after Silverstone run\n\nRed Bull’s engine loophole raises theory as 2026 F1 legality row grows\n\nWhy One F1 Team Boss Thinks Ferrari Fans Deserve Sympathy Ahead of 2026 Season",

    "fullText": "HUDSONVILLE, Mich. (WOOD) — I-196 in the Hudsonville and Zeeland area reopened just before 6 p.m. after being closed for much of the day following a pileup of more than 100 cars, including dozens of semis, authorities say, amid heavy snow and windy conditions Monday morning.\n\nThe highway was closed for nearly eight hours between exit 62 to Hudsonville and exit 55 to Zeeland, according to the Ottawa County Sheriff’s Office. Crashes began around 10:20 a.m.\n\nArctic air, lake-effect snow to hit West Michigan\n\n“Deputies were dispatched after receiving multiple reports of numerous crashes and slide-offs in the area,” the sheriff’s office said in a release. “The incident also includes several jack-knifed semi-trucks.”\n\nAll of those injured in the crash, about nine to 12 people, had been taken to hospitals by 2 p.m., authorities said in a release. No fatalities were reported.\n\nInside woodtv.com: Live traffic conditions\n\nAuthorities used buses to take a few dozen stranded drivers to Hudsonville High School where they were able to call for rides, reconnect with family members and warm up.\n\nThe high school’s parking lot is being used as a drop-off lot for damaged vehicles while owners arrange for repairs.\n\n“Motorists are encouraged to avoid this stretch of (I-196) and avoid travel completely, unless necessary,” the sheriff’s office said.\n\nThe northbound lanes of US-131 at West Main and the US-131 Business Loop have reopened after a series of car crashes shut it down for much of the day Monday, the Kalamazoo County Sheriff’s Office reported.\n\nApproximately 15 vehicles were involved in crashes, including multiple jackknifed semi-trucks entangled in a guardrail.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Grand Rapids issued a warning to drivers, saying that “travel is not recommended” near and west of US-131 through Monday afternoon. Crashes have been reported throughout the day, closing single lanes and entire roads.\n\nWinter storm warnings and winter weather advisories are in effect through 7 a.m. Tuesday. The heaviest snow is expected to fall through Monday morning, with rates gradually lessening after that. The most persistent snow will be along and west of US-131. Winds gusting over 30 mph will create substantial blowing and drifting, leading to reduced visibility and, at times, whiteout conditions.\n\n“Numerous whiteouts are being captured on (Michigan Department of Transportation) webcams across major interstates and highways this morning,” the NWS wrote around 5:20 a.m. “Winds increase this morning and the risk for whiteouts will also be increasing.”\n\nDownload the free Storm Team 8 weather app\n\nAs temperatures hover in the teens and continue to fall, road crews have been forced to change up their strategy. Salt becomes less effective during the extreme cold, so crews are mixing in sand to provide traction.\n\n“The sand becomes the primary part of that mixture. It’s almost all sand with some liquids to cut it in,” Steve Roon, maintenance director for the Kent County Road Commission, told News 8. “We may go upwards of 1,000 pounds of sand per centerline mile, so that we’re giving that traction across that driving surface where we can.”\n\nThe Kent County Road Commission says it will keep returning to state and county primary roads Monday to make sure they’re passable. As conditions allow, crews will move into local roads.\n\nIf you’re heading out, the road commission urges you to take it slow, keep your headlights on and give plow trucks plenty of space.\n\nMost schools across West Michigan are closed Monday. Many were already closed in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, while others called a snow day. For a full list of closings, click here.\n\n— News 8’s David Horak contributed to this report.",

    "description": "Vay is rental car service startup that is fully embracing remote-driving technology in order to deliver cars to users without a human inside.",
    "fullText": "In the world of robotaxis, there's a stigma around remote driving. Are you really \"driverless\" if there's a person — even remotely — at the wheel?\n\nOne startup is fully embracing it.\n\nVay is a Berlin-based startup founded by two engineers and a former Zoox employee.\n\nThe company is taking a somewhat contrarian approach to what it calls a \"driverless car.\"\n\nInstead of automating the ride-hailing service, which can be technically challenging and costly to scale, Vay wants to rethink how we rent cars.\n\nTo do so, Vay wants to leverage remote-driving technology and, eventually, autonomy to deliver cars without humans inside to people who need a private vehicle for less than a day.\n\nThomas von der Ohe, cofounder and CEO of Vay, told Business Insider that the goal is to be cheaper than an Uber and more convenient than a traditional brick-and-mortar rental program.\n\n\"It's basically by far the most affordable A to B transport,\" von der Ohe, a former technical program manager during the early days of Zoox, said. \"It's half the price of Uber and half the price of robotaxis. How it works: We just bring the car, you then drive, and then when you're done, you don't have to park.\"\n\nVon der Ohe spent less than two years at Zoox when the company was just 60 people large and had yet to be acquired by Amazon. The Vay cofounder said he oversaw some of the first public testing of Zoox cars when there were safety drivers inside the vehicle.\n\nAt the robotaxi company, von der Ohe said he saw a goal with an ever-shifting timeline.\n\n\"It always felt like it was three years out,\" he said of autonomous driving. \"And then every year it shifted by a year. So we wanted to have self-driving cars everywhere in 2020 at Zoox. And then it was 2021 and so forth.\"\n\nVon der Ohe left Zoox in 2018. Instead of fixating on robotaxis, von der Ohe wanted to stay in mobility but work on something that could be faster to bring to market and easier to scale with less capital. Vay was born.\n\nCustomers order a car the same way they hail an Uber or Lyft through Vay's app. To rent a car, users have to upload a driver's license and a photo of themselves.\n\nVay proposes that users can get a car delivered to them without a driver within minutes, as long as they're within the service area or geofence. If you're out of the service area, then you're out of luck.\n\nOnce the car is delivered, the renter takes over.\n\nThe startup services Las Vegas, where it manages a fleet of 100 Kia Niros, a compact, all-electric SUV. Each Kia is retrofitted with four cameras. There are no other sensors, von der Ohe said.\n\nThe Vay cofounder told Business Insider that the service area is about twice the size of San Francisco.\n\nInside Vay's Vegas office, there are about eight driving stations, in which a trained human operator remotely controls Vay's vehicle fleet. The setup looks like a video game simulation with three computer screens and a disembodied driver's seat.\n\nA large red button to the left of the driver's seat activates an emergency protocol during which the car pulls over to the side of the road.\n\nVincent Reddy, an operations lead for Vay, said that there are several criteria a remote driver needs to meet, including completing about 1,000 kilometers of remote driving. Reddy remotely drove Business Insider during a demo ride.\n\n\"It's similar to kind of like a high-grade racing sim,\" Reddy said of the driving experience. \"The thing that feels the most different is not having the feedback of what it feels like driving over bumps and things on the road because the seat doesn't move. There's no G-force, or you don't get the feeling of accelerating or braking.\"\n\nTo deliver the cars, Vay only uses the remote-driving technology on local roads and stays under 25 mph. The car can go on the highway once the customer takes over the vehicle.\n\nThere were no notable incidents during a 10-minute driverless ride around the block of Vay's Vegas office.\n\nVay's value proposition to customers is that the service is cheaper and more flexible than hailing an Uber.\n\nVon der Ohe told Business Insider that the service should be about 50% cheaper than the average Uber ride.\n\nUsers are charged by the minute, with a decreased price if they are parked, in case they, for example, need to grab groceries or hit the gym.\n\nWhen Business Insider viewed the app, the pricing was at $0.35 per minute while driving and $0.05 per minute while parked. At those prices, a 30-minute drive to and from a destination, including an hour-and-a-half stop, would cost around $25.\n\nWhen asked if the pricing will change based on demand, von der Ohe said the company doesn't yet have a pricing mechanism, such as surge pricing, in place, but expects there will be changes to the structure.\n\nThe CEO said he can keep the costs low because Vay's vehicle fleet doesn't have a complex sensor suite, and the remote operators manage multiple cars.\n\nVon der Ohe said that as of January 2026, there is one remote operator for every 10 vehicles. However, that doesn't mean a remote driver is operating 10 vehicles at the same time. Instead, a remote operator can deliver one car and immediately move on to the next vehicle.\n\n\"So I have much more cars and remote drivers, and that's why we make it half the price,\" he said.\n\nVay employs about 200 people and raised more than $200 million, including a $60 million investment from Grab Holdings, the Singaporean tech company that owns Grab, the super app of Southeast Asia.\n\nWhile von der Ohe told Business Insider that building a fully autonomous ride experience like Waymo is not on Vay's road map, the CEO said his startup will gradually add autonomous driving features.\n\n\"We're not in competition with them,\" von der Ohe said of robotaxi operators.\n\nSince its founding, Vay has provided 35,000 trips, according to the CEO.\n\nHe said the service has especially seen high demand during the Consumer Electronics Show.\n\nWhen Von der Ohe opened the app, the wait time to get a car was 31 minutes.\n\n\"It's extremely busy today already,\" he said. \"It's a long way. It should be five.\"",

    "fullText": "Designing a Formula 1 engine has helped Ford gain the edge against Chinese cars, Ford's CEO Jim Farley said.\n\nFord announced in 2023 that it would supply Oracle Red Bull Racing with its engines from 2026. On Friday, Red Bull unveiled its car for the 2026 Formula 1 season, powered by the Red Bull Ford Powertrains engine.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg published on Sunday, Farley was asked how developing the engine has helped him deliver better value for his customers.\n\n\"It's a long list, but I would say the real signature for me is really the software — the control software for the hybrid system, predictive failure components,\" Farley said.\n\nAnd designing better software is a key step to beating Chinese cars, he said.\n\n\"These are the essence of the new software-defined vehicle globally to beat China, and they are really good,\" he added. \"We need these capabilities from Formula 1, and we can put them right in the Transit van.\"\n\nWorking on the F1 engine with Red Bull has helped Ford understand LLMs and predict component failures, which can benefit both Red Bull driver Max Verstappen and Ford's customers.\n\nThis is not Ford's first foray into F1. It supplied engines for the race from 1967 until 2004.\n\nFarley has, on several occasions, gushed about the tech capabilities of China's automobiles. In October 2024, he said he had been driving an EV from the Chinese tech giant Xiaomi for half a year and didn't want to give it up.\n\nAnd in July, speaking at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Farley said, \"They have far superior in-vehicle technology,\" citing Xiaomi's phone-to-car pairing capabilities.\n\nChinese automobile companies, particularly EV makers, have gone all in on smart technology in recent years. An executive of CATL, a Chinese EV battery manufacturer, said during the World Economic Forum last year that China's automakers were retiring the traditional term \"EVs\" in favor of \"EIVs,\" or electric intelligent vehicles.\n\nAnd after the Chinese AI company DeepSeek launched its R1 model last year, major automakers like BYD, Geely, and Great Wall Motor said they would integrate it into their cars.",

Amy, Cornwall\n\nSend new questions to nq@theguardian.com.\n\nIt’s high time the government put its foot down. EddieChorepost\n\nNo. People slow down when they see one. EGriff\n\nI’ve an idea – why don’t the authorities dig lots of holes in the road to encourage drivers to slow down (the encouragement being avoidance of severe and expensive damage to tyres, wheels and suspension). We could call them “potholes”. Oh – hang on … DocLobster1960\n\nSpeeding is antisocial behaviour, so why not make the people who do it pay into the coffers for the good of society?\n\nI don’t care whether cameras are hidden or not, people should just abide by the speed limits. It’s not as if speed limits are designed as a punishment. Goldgreen\n\nI got a speeding ticket in Wales on my first visit there after they introduced a 20mph limit, I opted to take the speed awareness course and found it to be invaluable. I suggest that all learner drivers take this course as you learn so much. I’ve been driving for 35 years and some of the things I learned have stuck with me today. It would be good if we were made aware before we started driving. I actually enjoyed the course. lozbags\n\nOf course there should be no warnings about fixed speed cameras. Mind you, this gives local residents an advantage. Tony Firshman, by email\n\nThe issue of whether speed cameras should be visible was decided by the Blair government (and the then transport minister John Spellar). Speeding motorists avoided them and continued speeding afterwards. This resulted in “crash migration”. Road safety has always been the Cinderella issue of policy and sadly, will continue to be, due to the moral bankruptcy of our politicians. Howard Bramwell, by email\n\nNo, cameras are there to slow drivers at dangerous places. However, the camera technology must be so cheap now that every (30mph) sign could have a camera behind it. I really struggle to do 20, though, because I have a muscle memory for driving in villages at 25-30mph. James M Bartlett, by email\n\nI don’t think there is clear evidence of what is more efficient in bringing accidents down, as the approach varies between countries. In Germany, speed cameras are usually hidden, behind bends or road signs. Mobile cameras are common. Sometimes, you have road signs warning of cameras (“Radar”), but they are usually quite a bit before the cameras. Mustbe6to20\n\nSpeed cameras don’t need to be hidden. They need to be ubiquitous. The want to be in every cat’s-eye in the country and round every bush and corner. Just get them in, save the lives instead of regretting them and force people to slow down.\n\nReally start the war on the motorist, and while you’re at it, make pedestrian crossing lights change immediately when someone presses the button. That’ll be the real signal for the war to begin. Andrew Riley, by email\n\nVisible. There’s a stretch of A road in north Norfolk which had two speed cameras. One has been removed – people still brake as they approach it. Visible still works best, even when it’s no longer visible. RosiesDad\n\nIt has always struck me that the use of average speed cameras (as opposed to so-called “safety cameras”) is much more effective at keeping vehicle speeds down to the speed limit. These use automatic numberplate recognition (ANPR) to check the time between cameras, so virtually all drivers stay at the speed limit but then speed up after passing the last camera (presumably to make up for the time they think they have lost while sticking to the speed limit). As ANPR spreads more widely (so we can catch the bad guys up to no good), it can’t be beyond the technology to use their data to better effect by catching speeders too. shropshirelasso\n\nNo need to hide them, they are meant to stand out, so if you are going too fast you can still slow down, but if you are going at a ridiculous speed that you don’t notice them, you then have no complaints. Like shooting fish in a barrel. Yes, there are some sneaky ones, but they are not necessary imho. Idiots end up getting caught out anyway. Damianleah\n\nI am all in favour of overt and covert ones. I am also all in favour of the police using roadside/bridge cameras to catch speeders. Further, I would welcome a tripling or more of the fines and points received, along with all drivers having to undertake a speed awareness course every five years in order to keep your licence – and don’t forget, holding a licence is a privilege and not a right.\n\nI am a driver who does far too many miles each year, and I have probably driven for more than 800,000 miles, and I have not been caught speeding. Oh, I’m not going to say I am some sort of saint, and I know I have exceeded the limit on many occasions, but if I had been caught, I would have deserved the penalty. Sallycycles\n\nSome people btl are claiming that hidden cameras wouldn’t work as a deterrent. But they would once you’ve been caught, fined and accumulated a few points. Insurance goes up and the risk of losing one’s licence should focus the mind pretty quickly. I’m sick of being tailgated when driving at the speed limit. Dropinjim\n\nSigns that tell you the speed you are doing (or a smiling face if you are doing the speed limit) are far more effective and for a greater distance afterwards at slowing people down than speed cameras. Having said that, average speed cameras seem to be a good direction to go, obviously better on long singular roads than towns with lots of roads leaving and joining, although it could still work. duncandavis\n\nWouldn’t a visible deterrent be better than letting people speed or get into an accident and have to deal with the aftermath? Patriiick\n\nYes, especially in school zones. A 2025 study in New York City showed that speed cameras reduced injuries by 16%, and collisions by 30%. Even better, Toronto Metropolitan University found that speed cameras reduced “the number of speeding vehicles by 45% in urban school zones”. RP Orlando, by email\n\nI have a, perhaps controversial, take on this. Hide the speed cameras, but don’t issue any fines to those who breach the limit. Just points on the licence. This would take away the argument from many that speed cameras are a cash cow and not a safety feature. Niels, by email\n\nIf you want to generate revenue, hide the cameras. If you want people to slow down, make them highly visible. I know very few people who haven’t been caught by a speed trap. I was going to go back to where my so-called offence took place but decided to take the cheap way out, a £100 speed awareness course that taught me nothing. I do know it was a dual carriageway with a barrier to stop pedestrians crossing the road – and a speed limit that dropped from 40 to 30 with no discernible reason. They have these cameras in Italy. They are the size of a wheelie bin and are bright orange. Guess what – no one speeds past them. The police also have radar guns but where it is important that people don’t speed, pedestrian crossings etc, the cameras do a perfect job. iptraveller\n\nIn Surrey, where I learned to drive, cameras were hidden, painted grey. When I started driving farther afield, I was amazed that anyone in the counties which had already adopted yellow painted cameras was ever caught speeding. They were so visible compared to the ones we had in Surrey. Now there are the warnings on GPS and satnavs. No excuses. WordChazer\n\nOften local authorities only put cameras at high accident sites. Average speed checks are located to stop street cruising, with limited effect. Previously I was a transport planner and had geographic information system access to all the locations and police metadata on the Stats19 forms. It is sobering to overlay all the slight, serious and fatal accidents, for all years. There is no discernible pattern – distribution of data points is everywhere. Zero accidents should be the aim. Not difficult to black box all new cars and stop speeding.\n\nAs a pedestrian, cyclist and driver I agree. I honestly believe drivers for their licence should walk down a dark country lane, cycle down an A road, deal with stupidly bright headlights. Driving is seen as a right but it’s not it’s a privilege. funkymentalist\n\nSpeed limit signs should be clearly visible, close enough together, and not faded, nor obscured by vegetation. They should not be contradictory, as they sometimes are when temporary signs are reached before permanent signs. When that has been achieved, speed cameras should be hidden. FromageBleu\n\nCould just make cars unable to exceed speed limit. Very easy to do. Or fit them all with black boxes. Seamusheaneyisbrown\n\nFrom July 2024 all new cars sold in the EU [and Northern Ireland] are required to have speed limiters. Wantage\n\nNo. I don’t think speed cameras should be hidden. That does not deter people speeding, it just gives them a ticket. The whole point is to slow people down.\n\nAnother aspect of road safety that bugs me a great deal is tailgating. This is a very serious offence in Florida. (I don’t know about the rest of the US.) It is up there with drink-driving, and in my opinion it should be because it is very dangerous, and causes some of the worst accidents on motorways.\n\nHopefully with AI, they can invent a camera which picks out vehicles tailgating. And I wish the police would give that issue as much attention as speeding, at least on motorways. AndyPandy1968\n\nIf [drivers] don’t know where speed cameras are (and there could be one anywhere) they’ll slow down. Currently they speed until they see a highly visible camera. TenaroG\n\nIt is better to drive for the current road conditions, not the speed limit. Speed limit signs encourage drivers to drive at that speed and cannot react to it raining or being icy – or react to rare events, like someone turning right into a seldom used road (I would argue a no-right turn sign would be better than dropping the speed limit to 50 or 40mph).\n\nMost times when you moderately exceed the speed limit, nothing happens; it is unlikely to cause an accident, unless there is a speed trap which causes sudden braking. However, it remains true that the energy of a crash is proportional to the square of the speed. There is more than double the energy crashing at 30mph over 20mph (50% speed increase).\n\nThere is no point driving at 30mph on a housing estate, a half a mile at 30mph takes 1 minute, at 20 takes 1.5 minutes. You just get to the next queue 30 seconds sooner. The average speed in London due to congestion is 7 to 20mph.\n\nOn a dual carriageway, the capacity (vehicles per hour) can be increased by reducing the speed: peak capacity 20mph for cars and 30mph for buses and lorries. Rob333\n\nNo. I see one, I slow down. I mean, ahem, I maintain that safe speed I was already doing, obviously! You could hide them and potentially make more revenue but that grapevine is waaaay bigger than anything Marvin sang about. Word spreads so quickly that people, at least locals, would know all about the secret cameras quicker than Shaw Taylor could say keep ’em peeled. catchytitle\n\nI was once cautioned for signalling to drivers that a speed camera was coming up.\n\nI thought, what’s your problem? Speed cameras are about improving road safety and I’m getting all the cars to slow down. They should have given me a medal and a gold clock, not a caution. Charismata\n\nEh? They are meant to make the roads safer. Which they don’t do if you don’t know they are there. Simply putting up a sign does not make people slow down, we know this from repeat experience. Practically, it would also be daft to hide them as you would need so many signs, eg to notify that cameras are present, then to notify that cameras are not. I’m very suspicious of the mentality that thinks they should be hidden to “catch people out”. It’s the same mentality that insists on prison for non-dangerous offences and, at its most extreme, capital punishment. Both things confer only brutality upon society and the resultant pressure on social and health services while probably not reducing crime. Believers of demonstrably ineffective punitive systems are a true menace, preferring we all suffer under such systems so they can get a sense of “vengeance”. This to me is more sociopathic than many of the criminals and certainly more so than most speeding drivers. Wyrdsister\n\nSpeed cameras are very expensive to install, maintain and operate, which is why they are only placed where deaths have occurred. If visible, then most drivers slow down at them proving that they work as intended, while drivers ignoring them correctly get fined. This is why you see many other physical methods for restricting speeds such as humps, tables, cushions and chicanes. Any road without cameras or physical controls will always see drivers that speed. swely\n\nWith an electric car there is so little feedback that I always use the speed limiter. It doesn’t require many people doing this to bring everybody into line, literally! I’ve worked in the auto industry and had to look at overall safety issues. The statistics are as clear as they are for smoking when it comes to speeding – just don’t do it. Forlornehope\n\nYes to secret cameras to reduce speeding but why stop there? Why not also introduce secret number plate recognition cameras to tackle the industrial-scale dumping of household goods all over our pavements?\n\nBritain’s cities, especially working-class communities, are being turned into public dumps where illegal fly-tipping by the middle-class and small businesses is out of control. If your vehicle is used for illegal public dumping, you should have your driving licence revoked for 12 months and then be forced to resit your driving test. Let’s take back control of our pavements! whitman100\n\nIn reply to whitman100: Most people don’t want to live in the surveillance society you describe. We know it doesn’t stop crime. It simply changes it. Wyrdsister\n\nThey seem to catch enough people anyway in their bright yellow condition. Seems fairer with that much warning. unclestinky\n\nClearly, having signs decreases the speed in any specific camera’s location. However, it also provides tacit permission to speed elsewhere.\n\nI think the obvious solution to this paradox is to require car manufacturers to begin turning off car safety features at 30mph. Start small – passenger airbags turn off at 31mph, driver ones at 50. By the time a car hits 71, an ejector seat should be ready to fire the driver into the ceiling. It would be interesting to learn how many drivers would be willing to risk their own health rather than that of others as they speed “perfectly safely”. Hugh B, by email\n\nThe recent road safety review ignored the elephant in the room, ie speed. Road traffic deaths [in Great Britain] have averaged around 1,600+ for the last several years; if that figure applied to air or rail travel, fleets would be grounded and networks shut down until the matter was investigated. Because road traffic deaths happen in small numbers per incident, they are hardly noticed, often barely making local media, marked only by sad little shrines of flowers by the side of a stretch of road.\n\nSo … my thoughts (not vote winners)\n\n1. Review all speed limits; 20mph where conditions are hazardous, 30 up to 40 on the outskirts of towns/villages (30 can go on too long)\n\n 2. Greater use of 50mph limit; it’s a big jump 40 to 60.\n\n 3. Increase the limit to 80mph on motorways.\n\nOnce that’s done, remove the requirement for cameras to be visible and allow local councils to share unpersoned mobile digital cameras and install far more average speed cameras.\n\nThen, allow some leeway (say 10%) and then prosecute everyone who speeds, increase the fines and the number of points. There will be a huge outcry which will settle down when death numbers start to fall dramatically (which they will!) As I said, not a vote winner but an effective strategy to deal with the current ludicrous situation where people think it’s OK to break the law a little bit. Phillip Tanswell, by email\n\nWhat about a road reflector containing radio-frequency identification (RFID) set to the proper (safe) speed limit? This would communicate with the vehicle passing above. The driver would be alerted and if speed is not adjusted the onboard computer does it for them. Roads are a public place … not your private racetrack. Paul Tobiason, by email",

    "fullText": "With clean energy efforts booming, a new discovery in Norway could fuel the future of the movement. A mining company has found an estimated 77 billion-ton phosphate deposit, enough to satisfy the global demand for the next 50 years, according to its discoverers.\n\nThe deposit was discovered by Norge Mining back in 2018, but it wasn't until this May that the company announced just how much phosphate it had discovered.\n\n\"Down to 400 meters, we established two world-class resources, which together allow a supply of raw materials for at least 50 years,\" Michael Wurmser, Norge Mining's founder and deputy CEO, told Euractiv.\n\nPhosphate, when processed into phosphoric acid, is a key ingredient in lithium iron phosphate batteries. These batteries are what keep many solar energy systems and electric vehicles running.\n\nIn fact, lithium iron phosphate batteries are soon expected to boom in usage. According to the International Energy Agency, by 2040, the market share of lithium iron phosphate batteries in commercial vehicles is expected to increase to 90%.\n\nAs demand for clean energy systems soars, this discovery isn't just important for its size — but also for its location. Before the discovery of this deposit, key producers of phosphate were Morocco, China, the U.S., and Russia. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the market has been massively disrupted.\n\nThe discovery of this deposit is expected to help alleviate some of that strain, which means EVs and solar panels could see a decrease in their costs.\n\n\"When you find something of that magnitude in Europe, which is larger than all the other sources we know — it is significant,\" Wurmser said. \"We believe the phosphorous that we can produce will be important to the West — it provides autonomy.\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the coolest innovations improving our lives and saving our planet.",

    "fullText": "A San Diego battery maker has an impressive sodium-ion product designed to replace long-standing lead-acid batteries in multiple settings.\n\nWith it, UNIGRID is staking a greater claim in the replaceable battery market — valued by Fortune Business Insights at nearly $50 billion annually.\n\nThe 12-volt product, dubbed Na⁺ Fleet, is designed to better start internal combustion engines in cars, trucks, forklifts, and other technology, as well as power lights and electronics in electric vehicles.\n\n\"Strategically, this is an attractive early entry market for sodium-ion; it is a large, already-existing market using an outdated technology that is primed for disruption,\" UNIGRID co-founder Darren H. S. Tan said in a press release.\n\nThe downside is that it's an investment in a product that's included in pollution-chugging transportation. In addition to reducing local air quality, tailpipe exhaust can increase cancer risks, according to the American Lung Association.\n\nHowever, the battery is also an advancement for sodium-ion chemistry, which is being developed by experts around the world as a cheaper, better-performing alternative to lithium-ion and lead-acid versions.\n\nUNIGRID said in a press release that its battery's lifetime is 10 times greater than lead-acid, which has been used for more than a century.\n\nThe breakthrough could replace these types of batteries, thereby reducing the amount of harmful waste generated by improperly disposed lead-acid packs. The Environmental Protection Agency detailed a number of problems they pose, such as lead exposure that can lead to brain, kidney, and hearing damage.\n\nNa⁺ Fleet can last for 5,000 cycles in hot or cold weather, requires no maintenance, and is lighter, UNIGRID noted among a list of perks.\n\n\"Sodium-ion … beats lead-acid in almost all metrics … including total cost,\" Tan said in the release.\n\nDo you worry about the longevity of EV batteries?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nSodium-ion packs are also being developed to power EVs, and UNIGRID's progress could be part of the path to next-generation technology for cleaner rides.\n\nEVs prevent thousands of pounds of air pollution annually when compared to gas cars, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Interesting Engineering added that Na⁺ Fleet can be used to power EV auxiliary systems, replacing lead-acid for that work, too.\n\nGlobal sales of EVs reached 18.5 million vehicles year-to-date through November, a 21% increase over 2024, according to supply chain analysts Rho Motion.\n\nOverseas markets are stronger than the stateside one, where growth has been \"subdued\" due to well-documented policy changes and the end of federal EV tax credits, the report added.\n\nBut it's still a great time to make the switch, as many states offer perks for buying and charging EVs, which provide yearly gas and service savings of up to $1,500. That's thanks to no oil changes, spark plug replacements, and other common maintenance.\n\nAdding home solar to charge the rides increases the savings. The Cool Down's Solar Explorer can help get you started with curated quotes, installer recommendations, and other tips.\n\nIn the meantime, UNIGRID continues to log sodium-ion innovations in a quickly advancing battery sector.\n\nThe latest one offers \"a substantially longer operational lifespan,\" the company said.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "DETROIT (AP) — Chinese automakers have been making inroads around the world with growing sales of their high-tech, stylish and affordable electric vehicles. That has had competitors concerned even before Canada this week agreed to cut its tariffs on Chinese EVs in exchange for concessions on Canadian farm products.\n\nExperts now say an easier path into Canada could be a big boost for Chinese carmakers looking to dominate the global market — particularly as their domestic market weakens. That poses a threat to other auto manufacturers, particularly American companies.\n\nU.S. officials acknowledged that in remarks at an assembly plant for Jeep-maker Stellantis in Toledo, Ohio on Friday. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Chinese Communist Party invests in its auto industry to “control this industry.”\n\n“Why? They want to take over the auto industry. They want to take away these jobs,” Duffy said. As far as the Canadian trade deal, he added: “They will live to regret the day they partner with China and bring in their vehicles.”\n\nOthers say the shift is inevitable.\n\n“This is telling us that Chinese automakers continue to be really popular, and are doing better and better, and not just something that’s sold in global markets that are more marginal or less important to U.S. automakers,” said Ilaria Mazzocco, deputy director and senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nWhat makes Chinese vehicles stand out?\n\nChinese-made vehicles are high-quality, stylish and inexpensive, experts say.\n\n“It’s clear that the vehicles made by Chinese brands come at a very competitive cost, but are also technologically quite desirable,” Mazzocco said. “They tend to be connected vehicles, so they have a lot of additional software capabilities that consumers seem to like. But the price point and the competitiveness are really big selling points.”\n\nThese vehicles can cost as little as $10,000 to $20,000; in the U.S., new vehicles are running close to $50,000 on average, and EVs even more so.\n\nChinese companies also have unique advantages as far as auto manufacturing and production, efficiency and making vehicles lighter, which helps extend an electrified vehicle's driving range.\n\n“They’ve found a way to make small and mid-sized cars — cars that people want — at a reasonable price,\" said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. \"These are the segments where GM and Ford and almost everybody else have abandoned.”\n\nMany automakers have discontinued smaller vehicles in favor of higher-margin, large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that are far more profitable.",

It will be driven by Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton, marking Hamilton’s second season with the team.\n\nThe Maranello-based outfit is scheduled to unveil the SF26 on January 23, 2026, just ahead of pre-season testing in Barcelona.\n\nAccording to Ferrari team principal Frederic Vasseur, the new car represents a “fresh start” for the Scuderia, fully adapted to the sweeping 2026 regulation changes that will reshape the sport’s hybrid power units and aerodynamic principles.\n\nFerrari’s focus has been on ensuring its power unit meets the new FIA guidelines, which emphasize sustainability, electrical efficiency, and reduced drag.\n\nWhile specific design features remain confidential, team sources have suggested the car is being developed with an emphasis on energy recovery performance and mechanical balance.\n\nMercedes has confirmed that its 2026 contender will be called the W17 E Performance, continuing the team’s naming convention. The car will be unveiled on January 22, 2026, one day before Ferrari’s launch.\n\nTeam principal Toto Wolff has described the upcoming season as “a fresh opportunity to innovate and redefine performance under a completely new rulebook.”\n\nThe Brackley outfit has emphasized reliability and adaptability as key priorities for the W17. Mercedes engineers have spent much of the past year developing their next-generation hybrid power unit to align with the new 50/50 internal combustion-to-electric power balance mandated by the FIA.\n\nThe team has also conducted early performance simulations, focusing on optimizing energy efficiency and aerodynamic flexibility.\n\nBoth Ferrari and Mercedes will enter the 2026 season with renewed optimism and extensive technical overhauls.\n\nFerrari’s new direction under Vasseur and Hamilton’s leadership gives the team fresh momentum, while Mercedes’ deep experience with hybrid systems may offer an early edge as the new regulations take effect.\n\nAs both cars prepare to hit the track for the first time in Barcelona, the competition between Ferrari and Mercedes could define the early stages of Formula 1’s new era.",

    "fullText": "The plan was to get on a bicycle to earn some money. It wasn’t to get hit by cars, thumped by skinheads or to see my surroundings in a whole new light\n\nGet our weekend culture and lifestyle email\n\nAt first I didn’t realise I’d been punched. I’m not sure why my brain assumed a bird had flown into me, but I suppose a magpie attack was more likely than a random bloke lashing out at my ribcage, so it took a second to realise what was happening.\n\nI was on my bike, waiting in a sidestreet for traffic to clear. The punch came from behind and by the time my mouth let fly a few expletives, the culprit was leaving. Then he caught wind of my colourful language and turned back to get in my face. He was a skinhead in a bad mood. Accusing me of being in his way, he told me I was lucky he didn’t do more damage. I paused mid-reply. This was the moment I realised he was ready to go to hell tonight, and the only thing he wanted to take with him was me.\n\nWhen you deliver for companies like Uber Eats, no two shifts are the same. I’d say 80% of my deliveries are fast food – a combination of McDonald’s, KFC, Hungry Jacks and coffee. Lots of coffee. My new workplace couldn’t be more different than the grey blur of an office, surrounded by the same walls and same people week after week. The culture shock of going from comfy chairs and morning teas to trying not to get killed in traffic was significant.\n\nAfter being made redundant four times in six years, months passed with hundreds of unsuccessful job applications. Bills needed to be paid. The big ones were still looming, but the small costs could be covered by delivering for Uber Eats. My Xbox was gathering dust so I sold it at Cash Converters and put the money towards a half-decent mountain bike.\n\nThe first thing that hits you riding is the feeling of independence. In between delivering Grey Goose vodka and KFC Zinger burgers, there’s the realisation that it’s just you out there. After four months, I haven’t talked to anyone at Uber Eats. I signed up on my phone, they sent me a fluoro thermal bag, and off I went. I don’t have to worry about anybody making me redundant because there is no anybody – there’s just me. If I want to spend hours in the park eating lunch, I will. Need more sleep? That’s between me and my doona. Granted, my wages are much lower, but what value can be placed on listening to Wu-Tang Clan with wind in my hair versus dreading another company restructure?\n\nJust to be clear, my hair is secure underneath a helmet. Which was good for when I collided with a car and ended up with a face full of road. There are lots of bike paths in Melbourne, but far too many of them are squeezed in between moving traffic and parked traffic. They’re less than a metre wide and often occupied by wavering cars, massive trucks or in this case, part of a parked Ford Fiesta. Before I could react, a driver had opened their door into the bike lane without looking. I couldn’t do anything except stop my bike dead while my body crashed into the bitumen.\n\nThings like this happen too often. I tore up my knee when my front wheel got caught in a tram track (a uniquely Melbourne problem) and my cheek laid against the road as I watched one of my earpods get crushed underneath a truck. A ute with aftermarket exhausts forced me into a gutter and my shins still haven’t recovered. It didn’t take long before I realised I could never relax on this job. My attention needs to be on 10 different things from one second to the next. My muscles are always tense, my brain always on alert. After a shift, it’s not unusual for my mind and body to immediately crash.\n\nI always knew urban planning was designed around cars but now I feel it in my bones. Not only is the amount of space dedicated to cars immense, society focuses on cars first. Shopfronts and advertisements face the road, hundreds of car parks take up thousands of metres and I avoid countless potholes in bike lanes while the cars right next to me drive on pristine asphalt.\n\nThere’s also a stark difference between people in cars and people I deliver to. When I hand over my orders, most are friendly. They’re dealing with hangovers or excited to get their comfort food. I once said “Pizza time!” to some young kids and they cheered. On the other hand, if there’s a form of life that’s lower than cyclists in the eyes of cars, it’s Uber Eats bikes.\n\nSome customers I’ve delivered to have been downright apologetic. I suppose they feel guilty for getting their Maccas order delivered when they live around the corner. No judgment from me; I still get my bonus for doing nine deliveries by 2pm. Uber Eats regularly gamifies their rewards for drivers: from week to week, they offer financial bonuses for set time periods. Let’s say you wake up on Monday and the app promotes an offer to do 30 orders before Thursday. Complete this task, and you’ll get $72 extra. It’s nice but unreliable. They’re random events based on demand and location. It can be a big bonus or a big nothing. Then it simply becomes how much effort you’re willing to put in. Another factor of being independent.\n\nUltimately, this job isn’t a long-term solution. It’s a Band-Aid on a broken leg. The jury is still out on whether it’s better than being stuck at a desk. Air-conditioning versus sizzling heat. Freedom of movement versus monitored hours. Meetings that could have been an email versus an outdoor activity that is improving my fitness but has a very real chance of causing my untimely death. The money’s not as good but I meet nice people, get to know my city and choose my own hours.",

    "fullText": "With Mecum Kissimmee in full swing, it’s a good time to take a closer look at the factory options that turned performance machines into auction record holders.\n\nWhen these cars were new, they weren’t conceived as future collectibles. They were production vehicles that you could walk into a dealership and order by checking boxes on a form. Many of these options were skipped simply because the average buyer didn’t feel they needed the extra performance for the added cost, and no one was thinking about how those decisions would matter decades later.\n\nWhat follows isn’t an exhaustive list. It’s a cross-section of factory options and vehicles, shaped in part by what we could actually find source photos for. Some of the rarest configurations simply don’t have usable images available, so they aren’t represented here.\n\nDecades later, those same choices are why these cars now sit at the very top of the collector market.\n\nAmong American muscle cars, few factory option combinations have proven more valuable than the pairing of 426 Hemi power and a convertible body, particularly at the end of the muscle car era.\n\nFor 1971, the final year of Hemi ’Cuda production, Plymouth built just 12 Hemi ’Cuda Convertibles. That exceptionally low production figure is the primary driver of the model’s value today.\n\nSurvivorship is extremely limited, and documentation is critical. Cars retaining their original matching-numbers 426/425 HP Hemi engines, factory drivetrains, and verified build data occupy the top tier of the collector market. Differences such as automatic versus manual transmission, axle packages, and production sequence can have a measurable impact on value among the small number of known examples.\n\nA documented 1971 Hemi ’Cuda Convertible currently being offered at Mecum Kissimmee 2026 illustrates how a single factory option—combining the Hemi engine with a convertible body—now places these cars among the most valuable American muscle cars ever built.\n\nLike the other vehicles featured here, the Hemi ’Cuda Convertible’s status is not the result of racing success or aftermarket modification. Its value is defined by a factory-approved option that was technically available, rarely chosen, and never repeated.\n\nIn the late 1960s, General Motors officially limited Camaro engine displacement to 400 cubic inches. Dealers found a workaround through the Central Office Production Order (COPO) system, which allowed special-purpose vehicles to bypass standard restrictions.\n\nThrough COPO, select Camaros could be ordered with 427-cubic-inch V8s. Most received iron-block engines, but just 69 were fitted with the all-aluminum ZL1, an engine derived from Chevrolet’s Can-Am racing program. The ZL1 dramatically reduced weight while delivering immense power, making it one of the most extreme factory engine options ever installed in a street car.\n\nThat simple engine choice is what elevates documented COPO ZL1 Camaros into seven-figure territory today.\n\nThe Judge was already a bold performance and appearance package, but pairing it with a convertible body style created one of the rarest factory GTO configurations Pontiac ever offered.\n\nOnly 168 GTO Judge Convertibles were built for the 1970 model year. While no exotic engine separates these cars mechanically, the Judge package itself was a defining factory option, and combining it with an open body proved unpopular when new.\n\nThat low take rate is what drives their value today.\n\nDodge produced 963 Challenger R/T Convertibles in 1970. Of those, just five were ordered with the 426 Street Hemi and a four-speed manual transmission.\n\nThe Hemi was a fully factory-approved engine option, but its high cost and demanding nature discouraged most buyers, particularly in a convertible. Survivorship is exceptionally low, and the rarity of that option combination is what pushes these cars into million-dollar territory.\n\nBuilt to homologate aerodynamic components for NASCAR competition, the Superbird was extreme even by muscle-car standards. Approximately 1,920 were produced, most equipped with the 440 Magnum V8.\n\nOnly roughly 135–170 were ordered with the optional 426 Hemi, a costly upgrade few buyers selected at the time. Today, that single factory engine option often separates six-figure Superbirds from seven-figure examples.\n\nDodge built 503 Charger Daytonas, the majority powered by the 440 Magnum. Only about 70 left the factory with the 426 Hemi, making them among the rarest American muscle cars ever produced.\n\nThe combination of radical aerodynamics and the Hemi engine created a dominant race car and one of the most valuable factory option packages of the era.\n\nAuction Prices: Multiple sales in the multi-million-dollar range\n\nWhen the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL debuted in 1954, it was already revolutionary. A small number of buyers, however, were allowed to order the Leichtmetallausführung, or Light Metal Version.\n\nThis factory option replaced the standard steel body panels with aluminum and added competition-oriented components. The option carried a substantial price premium when new, and fewer than 30 alloy-bodied Gullwings were produced.\n\nToday, documented factory alloy examples sell for millions more than standard steel-bodied cars.\n\nAuction Prices: Can exceed $3 million\n\nThe L88 was one of the most extreme factory engine options ever offered in a production Corvette. Introduced in 1967 and available through 1969, the option spanned the final year of the C2 and the early C3 generation, with the engine itself—rather than the body style—being the defining factor.\n\nOfficially rated at 430 horsepower, the aluminum-head 427-cubic-inch V-8 was intentionally underrated. Real-world output was significantly higher, but Chevrolet paired the L88 with restrictive ordering requirements that ensured only informed buyers selected it.\n\nChoosing RPO L88 automatically bundled heavy-duty suspension and cooling components while deleting common comfort features such as a radio and heater. The result was a Corvette that prioritized performance over usability, reinforcing the engine’s competition-focused intent.\n\nOriginality and documentation are critical to value, as the L88’s purpose-built nature makes correct components and factory verification especially important. Well-documented examples, whether late-C2 or early-C3, consistently reside at the top of the Corvette market.\n\nLike the other vehicles featured here, the L88 Corvette’s status is defined by a factory-approved option that was technically available, rarely chosen, and never intended for casual ownership. That single engine decision is what now places these cars firmly in multi-million-dollar territory.\n\nThe L89 was a factory option that spanned two Corvette generations, appearing in the final year of the C2 and the first year of the C3. Rather than being tied to a single body style, the option itself was the defining factor.\n\nRPO L89 paired Chevrolet’s 427-cubic-inch big-block with aluminum cylinder heads, reducing weight while preserving street usability. It could be ordered with several 427 variants, making it a flexible but rarely selected performance upgrade.\n\nIn total, fewer than 850 Corvettes are believed to have been equipped with the L89 option across both model years. While not every example commands seven figures, the most original, well-documented cars—regardless of generation—have crossed the million-dollar mark at auction.\n\nAs with the other vehicles featured here, it is the factory-approved option, not the body style alone, that defines long-term value.\n\nAuction Prices: Approaching or exceeding $1 million\n\nOffered for just one year, RPO ZR2 was a factory competition package built around the high-revving LT1 small-block V8. It bundled heavy-duty suspension, upgraded cooling, racing-focused driveline components, and deleted common comfort features.\n\nOnly 12 ZR2 Corvettes were built, making it one of the rarest factory Corvette options ever offered.\n\nNone of these cars became million-dollar collectibles by accident. In every case, the leap in value traces back to factory-approved options that were available, yet rarely chosen.\n\nThese were not dealer modifications or one-off prototypes. They were decisions made on order forms, often dismissed as unnecessary at the time. Decades later, those same decisions define the top of the collector market.\n\nSometimes, the most valuable performance upgrade isn’t horsepower alone—it’s the option almost no one ordered.",

    "description": "Tesla and legacy automakers are shifting to budget-friendly EVs amid sales declines, subsidy cuts, and mounting US consumer auto debt concerns.",
    "fullText": "On the surface, the electric-vehicle industry looks like it's heading into 2026 with a flat tire.\n\nFederal subsidies are gone, and EV sales have cooled since September. Even Tesla, America's dominant EV maker, is experiencing a sales slowdown.\n\nNow, carmakers are scrapping once-ambitious EV plans.\n\nIn December, Ford discontinued production of the all-electric F-150 and announced a $19.4 billion write-down tied to its battery investments. A week later, Volkswagen halted production of the electric ID. Buzz minivan for 2026, with plans to potentially revive it in 2027.\n\nThat trend snowballed on Thursday. General Motors said it expects to lose $6 billion as it retools its EV strategy. On the same day, Stellantis went even further, discontinuing every plug-in hybrid in its lineup — including the once-bestselling Jeep Wrangler 4xe.\n\nBut beneath the headline-grabbing cancellations, there's a quieter shift underway that could end up reviving the ailing EV market. It has everything to do with the auto industry's biggest problem: price.\n\n\"Electric vehicles are becoming more affordable as more mainstream options enter the market,\" Erin Keating, an executive analyst at Cox Automotive, told Business Insider. \"We're finally seeing automakers deliver EVs at price points beyond the luxury segment.\"\n\nThis year, legacy automakers — including several that recently pulled back EV projects — are preparing their factory floors to churn out lower-cost electric cars. Startups are jumping into the fray, too.\n\nNissan's Leaf just rebooted as a $29,000 Tesla Model Y look-alike. Subaru and Toyota are launching the Uncharted and C-HR — nearly identical crossover SUVs with $35,000 starting prices. Kia will have a $35,000 competitor with the EV3. Rivian is about to release its $45,000 R2 onto American roads. The Jeff Bezos-backed Slate anticipates its mid-$20,000 pickup will launch in the fall. Chevy's Bolt is returning with $29,000 on the sticker.\n\nThe push toward cheaper EVs is expected to roll into 2027, too, with Ford launching its $30,000 electric pickup.\n\nIt all comes as Americans struggle to keep up with every-expanding vehicle debt.\n\nThe average price of a new vehicle sold in the US hit $50,077 this week, Automotive News reported, citing Cloud Theory's average marketed price metric. That sticker shock has pushed the median buyer to put $6,579 down and take on monthly payments of $748 stretched across nearly six years, NerdWallet data shows.\n\nMeanwhile, Americans carried a record $1.66 trillion in auto loan debt in 2024, the most recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That's more than credit cards and federal student loans, and second only to mortgages. Delinquencies also crept higher that year, a sign that many consumers ran out of room to absorb ever-larger car payments.\n\n\"The reality was that new vehicle sales were being driven by well-heeled consumers,\" Keating said — a dynamic that was especially pronounced in the EV market.\n\nSince 2020, when legacy automakers started launching their first EVs to compete with Tesla, they focused heavily on top-end cars with luxury prices.\n\nThe Ford F-150 Lightning, for example, started around $50,000. Higher-end trims climbed into the high-$90,000 range. Rivian's R1S SUV started at $77,000. Lucid's Air sedan cost between $70,000 and $250,000.\n\nIn September, the federal $7,500 tax credit that helped modestly bring down those high prices largely expired.\n\nNow, as those same carmakers roll out lower-priced models, the industry appears to be course correcting, Keating said. Much of the early EV premium reflected the cost of building an entirely new ecosystem, she added.\n\nEarly buyers weren't just paying for a car. They were helping automakers finance new battery plants, retool factories, retrain workers, and pour billions into supply chains that didn't yet exist.\n\nSix years later, much of that infrastructure is already in place. As a result, new EV consumers are beginning to see those sunk costs roll off the sticker price.\n\nNow, automakers are going to see how much consumers actually want competitive EV products.\n\n\"We're entering a period where we'll see what organic demand for EVs actually looks like, without the policy thumb on the scale,\" Keating said. \"They're not going to abandon EV platforms. They've already made the investments.\"",

It called the move \"absolutely unacceptable and deeply regrettable\" and said the measures targeted only Japan and that they \"deviate significantly from international practice.\"Johnson said Japan is unlikely to respond immediately but could retaliate if restrictions intensify, adding that other countries could potentially follow suit.",

    "fullText": "A Caracas highway is choked with cars.\n\nBut far from typical rush hour traffic, Avenida Boyacá, a highway running alongside El Avila National Park in Venezuela’s capital, has ground to a halt because masked men holding Kalashnikovs are stopping drivers and demanding to search their phones and cars.\n\nThe gangs of armed men, part of pro-Maduro militias known as Colectivos, scoured vehicles at hastily erected checkpoints following a government directive to root out Venezuelans in support of the US’s brazen capture of Nicolás Maduro.\n\nDays after the sudden decapitation of the Maduro regime, Venezuelans have been left fearing what could come next as mobs of men dressed in civilian clothes with assault rifles slung over their shoulders roam the streets.\n\n“The future is uncertain, the Colectivos have weapons, the Colombian guerrilla is already here in Venezuela, so we don’t know what’s going to happen, time will tell,” Oswaldo, a 69-year-old Venezuelan shop owner, told The Telegraph.\n\nA state of emergency decree published on Monday has sought to crack down on any public celebration of the US operation. It ordered police to “immediately begin the national search and capture of everyone involved in the promotion or support for the armed attack by the United States”.\n\nOne Venezuelan, who wished to remain anonymous, said she would no longer leave the house with her phone over fears it could be scoured for anti-Maduro texts or photographs, which could lead to her imprisonment.\n\nThe paramilitaries have already arrested 14 journalists and media workers – 11 from foreign news outlets – for hours before releasing some of them. The whereabouts of other journalists are unknown.\n\nThe presence of Colectivos, armed men who ride around on motorcycles and are used as an unofficial government arm of repression, suggests that Maduro loyalists are desperately attempting to maintain their grip on the country.\n\nVideos circulating on social media shows armed men declaring they would not allow Donald Trump and US “pigs” to come in and plunder the country’s natural resources.\n\nAnother video shows interior minister Diosdado Cabello, Mr Maduro’s closest ally, posing with a crowd of the armed militia as they shouted: “Always loyal, never traitors.”\n\nMr Cabello, who has a $50m bounty on his head for drug trafficking charges, largely controls the Colectivos.\n\nAs Mr Maduro pleaded his innocence and claimed he was a “prisoner of war” during his arraignment at Manhattan Federal Court, armed supporters said his heart and soul remained in Venezuela.\n\n“There’s enough people here, there’s enough balls here to fight for this revolution, to fight for this motherland,” said a man who identified himself as Freddy Rodriguez, a member of Cupaz, a network set up by Maduro in 2019 to control protests.\n\nOn Monday morning, most shops and businesses had reopened in Caracas and the long queues of panicked Venezuelans trying to buy provisions had dissipated.\n\nPolice and intelligence officers lined the streets in the centre of Caracas, with two main avenues closed as Delcy Rodriguez, Mr Maduro’s vice president, was sworn in by her brother, National Assembly leader Jorge Rodrigue.\n\n“I come with sorrow for the suffering inflicted upon the Venezuelan people following an illegitimate military aggression against our homeland,” she said while holding up her right hand.\n\n“I come with sorrow for the kidnapping of two heroes.”\n\nHer comments struck a different tone than on Sunday when she said she had “invited the US government to work together on an agenda of co-operation” in the wake of Mr Trump’s warning that she would pay a “very big price” should she not do as instructed.\n\nIn Caracas, Venezuelans who had initially welcomed Maduro’s capture, hoping it would lead to real change in the country, were left feeling deflated by Ms Rodriguez’s ascension and the continuation of Mr Maduro’s regime.\n\nThe country’s constitution requires an election within 30 days whenever the president becomes “permanently unavailable” to serve. However, the Supreme Court declared Mr Maduro’s absence a “temporary” one.\n\nIn such a scenario, the vice president takes over for up to 90 days – a period that can be extended to six months with a vote of the National Assembly.\n\nMaría Corina Machado, the Venezuelan Opposition leader and recent winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, said the crackdown by the militia was “really alarming” and that the country’s transition to democracy needed to happen.\n\n“Delcy Rodriguez, as you know, is one of the main architects of torture, persecution, corruption, narco-trafficking,” Ms Machado told Fox News. “She’s a main ally and liaison of ‍Russia, China, Iran, certainly not an individual who could be trusted by international investors and she’s really rejected by the Venezuelan people.”\n\nThere has been no discussion of holding democratic elections and the future of the country still hangs in the balance.\n\n“I wanted a change in government because these people have done a lot of damage to the country; they forgot they were public servants, they thought they owned the country,” shopkeeper Oswaldo said.\n\n“But now we’re at the same point, he has left and another has replaced him – Delcy Rodriguez, Diosdado Cabello and Vladimir Padrino López – they’re all still here.”\n\nSpeaking to The Telegraph in Plaza Altamira while she waited for a job interview, Aurora said she had hoped for a regime change but said her main concern was putting food on the table.\n\n“Most international leaders don’t agree with what happened, but it happened.\n\n“We saw it coming, everybody saw it coming, but nobody imagined it would happen like this, so violent. Some wished for it and others not, but there is not one country in the world that can interfere in the government and say the oil is mine, no, this is a lie, this belongs to the Venezuelan people.”\n\nWhile she pushed back at Mr Trump’s suggestion he would “run” Venezuela, Aurora, a care worker from Petare, said: “We needed a change and it was necessary and now we need a transition.”\n\n“Every birth involves pain and now we have to move forward,” she added.\n\nOthers were less accepting of the current situation.\n\n“Honestly, I think this should not have happened; he [Maduro] should be in his country governing his country,” a 59-year-old sports coach, who requested to remain anonymous, said.\n\n“All I wish for Venezuela is for things to be calm, we’ve been through so much already... I know that we weren’t well, but emotionally and physically we were more at peace.”\n\nThe thought of Mr Trump deciding what comes next for Venezuelans, as opposed to holding fair elections, has left many concerned.\n\n“I don’t agree with what Trump said, he said he was coming to run our country – I want a transition, I want elections,” Oswaldo said.\n\n“If the majority of people are in favour of Delcy, fine, if it is a transparent election and we will recognise the results peacefully – if the Chavismo wins, then ok, but if the opposition wins, they will have to recognise their defeat.”\n\nJournalists in Caracas contributed to this report but asked to withhold their names for fear of reprisals from the regime\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "Business Insider is on the ground at Las Vegas CES 2026. Here's everything we learned on self-driving cars and robotaxis,",
    "fullText": "Business Insider is taking on CES 2026.\n\nI'm on the ground in Las Vegas from Tuesday to Thursday, taking in all there is to know about the latest in the driverless space.\n\nRobotaxis and self-driving cars have already had an outsize presence at the tech conference, especially in the previous hype cycle of the late 2010s and early 2020s.\n\nThings have changed since then. The industry has largely moved on from mere concepts and technology validation to: How are we going to realistically scale autonomy?\n\nIt's day one of the conference, and there's already a lot to take in.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang unveiled the Alpamayo family, which will serve as an autonomous-driving stack for OEMs to deal with those stubborn edge cases — or the \"long tail\" of self-driving.\n\nUber and Nuro showed off an early look at the Lucid Gravity SUV that the companies hope public riders will be able to take by late 2026.\n\nI'll be spending less time at keynotes and speaker events and more on real-life demonstrations and meetings with industry leaders and commentators in autonomy\n\nThink of this as my personal notebook, where I jot down everything I've learned and seen at the conference.\n\nCheck back in for more updates.\n\nThis is the first year Zoox, an Amazon-backed robotaxi company, will be giving live demonstrations of its service during CES.\n\nI got to take a ride in one on Monday night in front of Resorts World. (The company tagline that I saw from an ad at the Harry Reid International Airport was: \"Don't just do the Strip. Zoox it.\")\n\nMy immediate thoughts were that Zoox feels unlike any other robotaxi or pseudo-robotaxi on the market. It felt more like I was on a theme park ride than in an everyday car we're familiar with.\n\nUnlike Waymo's robotaxis, Zoox is not a regular car you could buy that's been retrofitted with sensors. The Zoox car is bi-directional — meaning there's no real front or back of the car — and the inside has no steering wheel, just seats.\n\nThe robotaxis were clearly a great tourist attraction from what I saw. My Uber driver wasn't too happy about them.\n\nUber, Lucid, and Nuro had a swanky cocktail hour at Fontainebleau Las Vegas, where they quite literally wined and dined a room full of reporters, analysts, and investors: endless glasses of wine and an open bar, lobster tails, jumbo shrimp, too many appetizers to count, and a giant charcuterie board — the works.\n\nMaybe understandably so? 2026 will be a big year for the three companies.\n\nUber's plan is to roll out a robotaxi service by late 2026. The first market is San Francisco, where Uber will directly compete with Waymo. These two companies are partners in other markets, like Austin.\n\n\"We've been moving very, very quickly,\" Nuro's co-CEO and cofounder Dave Ferguson said. \"We signed this partnership last July. We're already testing the production-intent vehicles on public roads. And very soon, we're going to have tens of thousands of them worldwide.\"",

    "fullText": "Officials in the Philippines recently confiscated a handful of cars that had been modified into racing cars, sharing details of the crackdown on Facebook and sparking conversation about the dangers of illegal modifications and street racing.\n\nThe Land Transportation Office in the Calabarzon region seized six Honda Civics that had been illegally modified and were allegedly being used for street racing in Batangas City.\n\nNews of the crackdown quickly spread, with the altered cars missing safety components, having \"improvised plates,\" and racing-style alterations that made them unsafe for public roads.\n\nAccording to authorities, the vehicles violated multiple traffic laws, including operating without registration, using defective or illegal accessories, and failing to meet basic safety requirements such as proper headlights, mufflers, bumpers, and mirrors.\n\n\"The illegal modification being done to these vehicles, especially if they are used for illegal racing, is not only a violation of the law but a serious danger to the lives of everyone on the road,\" LTO Chief Assistant Secretary Markus Lacanilao said in a statement, as reported by the Daily Tribune.\n\nModified cars with exposed parts, loud exhaust systems, and missing safety features have become a common sight in some areas — often celebrated online but simultaneously feared by pedestrians and everyday drivers.\n\nBeyond safety risks, illegal street racing increases noise pollution, contributes to road damage, and puts unnecessary strain on emergency services — all while endangering people who never consented to take part. On top of that, while some modifications can be beneficial — even eco-friendly — many modified vehicles burn more fuel, creating more pollution and contributing to poorer air quality and human health issues.\n\n\"We will not stop implementing strict laws — all vehicles used in such illegal activities, traffic violations, regardless of type or class, will be apprehended without bias,\" Lacanilao added. \"Road safety is the LTO's primary priority, and we are ready to take steps to prevent avoidable incidents.\"\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Jensen Huang also announces at CES new, more powerful Vera Rubin chips that will arrive later this year\n\nThe billionaire boss of the chipmaker Nvidia, Jensen Huang, has unveiled new AI technology that he says will help self-driving cars think like humans to navigate more complex situations.\n\nThe world’s most valuable company is to roll out the new technology, Alpamayo, which is designed to help self-driving cars handle tricky situations such as sudden roadworks or unusual driver behaviour on the road, rather than just reacting to previous patterns.\n\nNvidia claims Alpamayo will bring chain-of-thought reasoning to self-driving vehicles, combining what the car sees with language-like reasoning.\n\nIn a speech at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the Nvidia founder and chief executive said: “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here, when machines begin to understand, reason and act in the real world. Robotaxis are among the first to benefit.\n\n“Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments and explain their driving decision. It’s the foundation for safe, scalable autonomy.”\n\nNvidia has started producing a driverless car powered by its technology, the Mercedes-Benz CLA, in partnership with the German carmaker. It will be launched in the US in the coming months, followed by Europe and Asia. Huang showed a video of the car driving through San Francisco with a passenger sitting behind the steering wheel, their hands in their lap.\n\n“It drives so naturally because it learned directly from human demonstrators,” Huang said, “but in every single scenario … it tells you what it’s going to do, and it reasons about what it’s about to do.”\n\nHuang also said the company’s next generation of chips was in full production, and they could deliver five times the computing power of the company’s previous products when serving up chatbots and other AI apps.\n\nHe revealed new details about the chips, which will arrive later this year as Nvidia faces increasing competition from rivals as well as its own customers.\n\nThe Vera Rubin platform, made up of six separate Nvidia chips, is expected to debut later this year. The flagship server will contain 72 of the company’s graphics units and 36 of its new central processors.\n\nHuang showed how they could be strung together into “pods” with more than 1,000 Rubin chips and said they could improve the efficiency of generating what are known as “tokens” – the fundamental unit of AI systems – by 10 times.\n\nTo get the new performance results, Huang said the Rubin chips used a proprietary kind of data that the company hopes the wider industry will adopt.\n\nWhile Nvidia still dominates the market for training AI models, it faces far more competition – from traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices as well as customers such as Alphabet’s Google – in delivering the fruits of those products to hundreds of millions of users of chatbots and other technologies.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Sony's Keynote This Year Was All About Electric Cars",
    "description": "The Sony Honda Mobility Afeela 1 is finally coming out.",
    "fullText": "At last year's CES, Sony's press conference showed off products from all over its portfolio, including a first look at The Last of Us season 2. This year, it was all about the Afeela, an electric car Sony's making in collaboration with Honda that it's been teasing for years, but is now finally getting ready to release.\n\nSony has big plans for Afeela. Previews have been less about hard specs like mileage or speed and more about the company's plans to change how we look at cars. Previously, that's included demo'ing integrations with other Sony services like Crunchyroll and themes for the car's interior based on Sony brands. Just last month, the company confirmed it would support PlayStation Remote Play in the Afeela, after teasing it at CES 2024. And the first time I saw the Afeela at CES, it was driven onto stage using a PS5 controller.\n\nNow, Sony's ready to talk more than aesthetics and cute integrations, but that unique voice didn't go anywhere. Headlining the show was the promise that the company's currently working on something called Afeela Intelligent Drive. Currently, it's sitting at level 2+ driver assistance, which means it can handle tasks like merging or lane changes, but Sony's planning to take it to level 4+ \"in the future,\" meaning full self-driving within certain areas. It probably won't be ready for launch, but it does show the company's getting serious about usability.\n\nOn that note, it also showed concepts for a future where Afeela users will basically just chill while the car drives itself. Those kind of promises aren't rare at CES, but Sony specifically called out its brand of entertainment products as what riders would occupy themselves with on their rides. Combined with the Intelligent Drive news, apparently that's what all those ecosystem cross-promotions were leading towards.\n\nBut until that future arrives, Sony still isn't afraid to use Afeela to push its products, although it isn't stopping there. The company brought PlayStation on stage to quickly reaffirm Remote Play will be baked into the Afeela (while also dropping the surprising stat that apparently half of all PlayStation Remote Play sessions now happen on the PlayStation Portal streaming handheld). It also said that the Afeela will have themes for its touchscreens based on Sony properties like Astro Bot and Gran Turismo. None of that is too far off from what the company's shown before, but the idea of turning your car into a media ecosystem doesn't stop there. Sony also announced the Afeela co-creation program, which will let developers and content creators make their own custom apps or media for the car.\n\nThese include things like themes and even special Android apps, but apparently, drivers can even customize the Afeela's \"motor\" sound, and put visuals on a small \"media bar\" on the front of the car. As an example, Sony brought out Japanese music producer Tomoko Ida, who demonstrated a motor sound she created that sounded more like a THX commercial than anything else.\n\nIt's honestly a pretty clever move for a car that's been all about the ecosystem as opposed to the hard specs so far. But it does have one oddity that maybe speaks to how long this thing's been teased. Apparently, developers for the Co-Creation program will be able to get paid in crypto, which Sony says will \"accelerate open co-creation,\" although it also says the Co-Creation program will be \"open to other automakers and service providers.\" I'm not sure Toyota will want to get paid on the blockchain, but whatever.\n\nDrivers will be able to access utilities and apps made for their Afeela using an app, but that raises the question: When will you finally be able to drive this thing?\n\nThe Afeela has been teased since CES 2023, but finally Sony says the car is in production and will begin delivering to customers in California sometime this year. In fact, all the photos you've seen of the Afeela throughout this article have been of an actual pre-production model for the initial Afeela car, now called Afeela 1.\n\nThat's huge for Afeela, but there is a catch. Those deliveries might take a while to reach the rest of the country. Sony says Arizona is next on its radar, but that sales won't make it there until 2027. Japanese deliveries are also slated for 2027, but living in New York, I'll just have to keep pretending this thing doesn't exist.\n\nThat's a bit of a blow for a car that started off this press conference promising a new future for how we drive, since even once it gets on the streets, it'll probably take even longer for that to come true. Still, Sony says it will allow people who have already registered to buy a car to start doing test drives of the car sometime before deliveries begin.\n\nI'll be honest, I don't cover cars much, and that this year's Sony press conference was all about one maybe points to a quiet year across the rest of the brand. That said, for people who are into driving, I can see the Afeela's appeal. It definitely feels more like a gadget than a gas guzzler, and I'm wondering if this is what the Apple Car might have looked like if it ever came out.\n\nProbably not—despite the fancy mock-ups, I did sit inside an Afeela last year, and it was fancy but still familiar. But that's also not where Afeela is stopping. Sony ended its keynote by driving the \"Afeela Prototype 2026\" onto the stage. It didn't look that different from the outside, but the company says it will offer \"greater spatial flexibility and accessibility.\" To me, that implies a step closer towards that future where the car is essentially a hangout zone that moves you while you play PlayStation, but only time will tell. I'll see you when I actually get behind the wheel of one of these things, probably sometimes in 2040.",

    "description": "Cadillac’s arrival takes the field to 22 cars, so the FIA has adjusted the Q1 and Q2 cut line while keeping Q3 as a 10-car shootout",
    "fullText": "With Cadillac joining the grid for the 2026 Formula 1 season, there will be 22 cars on the grid, two more than we're currently used to. Because of this, qualifying will see a small change to include the extra two cars. This is what you need to know.\n\nF1's 2026 qualifying format will still have the familiar three-part knockout structure that we're all accustomed to. With a larger grid this year, slight changes have been made to ensure the fight for pole in Q3 still includes just 10 cars.\n\nUnder the FIA's 2026 sporting regulations, qualifying is still split into Q1, Q2 and Q3, with the same timed run plan.\n\nQ1 lasts 18 minutes, followed by a seven-minute break. Q2 will run for 15 minutes with another seven-minute break, and Q3 will last 12 minutes with an eight-minute break. What's different is the cut line.\n\nThe regulations explain that the “procedure detailed in this Article is based upon twenty (20) Cars being officially eligible”, but then add the scaling clause: “If twenty-two (22) Cars are eligible six (6) will be eliminated after Q1 and Q2.”\n\nSo with 22 cars, this is what the format will look like:\n\nP17–P22 (based on fastest Q1 times among eliminated)\n\nP11–P16 (based on fastest Q2 times among eliminated)\n\nP1–P10 (based on fastest Q3 times)\n\nThe sporting regulations confirm that lap times achieved by the remaining cars will then be deleted at the end of Q1, and this same rule applies to Q2 when the field is reduced once again. Just like 2025, there is no banking a better time in a previous section.\n\nSprint qualifying sees the same changes, albeit with shorter sessions.\n\nP17–P22 (based on fastest SQ1 times among eliminated)\n\nP11–P16 (based on fastest SQ2 times among eliminated)\n\nP1–P10 (based on fastest SQ3 times)\n\nWith 22 cars on the grid, we're not seeing a reinvented qualifying. While six drivers will be eliminated in Q1 and Q2, the format still funnels the top 10 cars into Q3 for a normal fight for pole.\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "London predicted to be the first UK city to go diesel-free, largely because of the ultra-low emission zone\n\nBattery electric cars are poised to overtake diesels on Great Britain’s roads by 2030, according to analysis that suggests London will be the first UK city to go diesel-free.\n\nThe number of diesel cars on Great Britain’s roads in June had fallen to 9.9m in June last year, 21% below its peak of 12.4m vehicles, according to analysis by New AutoMotive, a thinktank focused on the transition to electric cars. Electric car sales are still growing rapidly, albeit more slowly than manufacturers had expected.\n\nHowever, the transition to cleaner vans is lagging behind cars, and the number of diesel vans has continued to rise, to a record 4.4m.\n\nThe UK went through a “dash for diesel” cars in the 2000s as the government granted them cheaper tax rates. Diesel engines tend to be more efficient than petrol engines, burning less fuel and producing less carbon dioxide.\n\nHowever, they also produce more nitrous oxides, which are harmful to health. In 2015 Volkswagen was found to have created software to cheat on emissions tests, kicking off the “Dieselgate” scandal, costing it alone €30bn (£26bn) around the world in fines, compensation and legal costs. Analysis this year suggested the extra emissions from cheat devices from Volkswagen and other carmakers were responsible for thousands of deaths and cases of asthma.\n\nSales of cars with diesel engines duly plummeted, to fewer than 100,000 in the first 11 months of 2025. However, it will take some time for the share of diesel cars on the road to diminish, as many cars bought during the peak years of diesels are only now being scrapped.\n\nBattery electric cars made up only 4% of the cars on UK roads last year, compared with 32% diesels and 58% that use petrol, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), a lobby group. The other 6% were hybrids, which mostly combine a smaller battery with a petrol engine.\n\nNevertheless, the number of diesels should drop as older cars are scrapped, delivering benefits for towns and cities where particulates tend to be concentrated. That will also have a knock-on effect for filling stations, leading to many withdrawing diesel supplies.\n\nLondon is expected to be the first place in the UK where no diesel cars or vans are registered, largely because of the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), which applies charges for more polluting non-compliant cars. Diesel numbers are also dropping rapidly in the central belt of Scotland, which contains Edinburgh and Glasgow, both of which have low-emission zones.\n\n“Ending the use of diesel is essential to clean up Britain’s choking cities,” said Ben Nelmes, the chief executive of New AutoMotive. “The UK is now rolling out electric cars at a rapid pace, and this is great news for everyone that enjoys clean air, quieter streets and really cheap running costs.\n\n“The UK imports billions of pounds of diesel every year, and we have been completely reliant on other countries to feed our thirst. Thankfully, we’re switching to electric cars at a rapid rate, and that will make the country cleaner and wealthier.”\n\nHowever, the analysis found that people in cities appeared to be selling their diesels to people in more rural areas.\n\nThe report found that, while the number of diesel vans has risen over the past decade, the peak of new diesel van sales probably happened before the pandemic, meaning the numbers on roads will eventually fall.\n\nMatt Finch, an environmental policy expert who co-wrote the report, said the world was “leaving the diesel age”. He said: “No one is denying diesel hasn’t been useful, but it has had its day.”",

(AP) — Heavy rain and high tides believed to be the most severe in two decades caused flooding in parts of Northern California on Saturday, prompting road closures and rescues of people trapped in cars.\n\nRoadways through a 15-mile (24-kilometer) stretch from the Sausalito area to San Rafael were flooded after a downpour coincided with record-breaking “ King Tides,” Marin County Sheriff's Sgt.

Some people kayaked along swamped streets, while others waded through water above their knees.\n\nA flood warning was in place for the San Francisco area until 2 p.m. Saturday and an advisory until 2 p.m. Sunday, according to the National Weather Service, and repeated rounds of rain were expected throughout the state on Sunday and Monday.\n\nTo the south in Santa Barbara County, roads were closed due to flooding and a key highway was blocked near Goleta due to a series of mudslides. A man died after he was swept into a creek during the storm, the county sheriff’s office said.\n\nKing Tides occur when the sun, moon and Earth are in alignment and the moon is in its closest position to the Earth, creating a stronger gravitational pull.",

    "fullText": "When self-driving cars make headlines, it’s usually because something went wrong — a glitch, a failure, an accident.\n\nOn a dark, isolated stretch of Highway 54 in New Mexico, Clifford Lee believes he’s alive today not because of his own reflexes — but because his Tesla Cybertruck, operating in Full Self-Driving mode, made a split-second decision for him.\n\n“I almost got killed,” Lee said. “I was shaking uncontrollably for a while.”\n\nLee was traveling northbound on a two-lane highway, cruising at about 75 miles per hour, using Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system — known as FSD — during a long road trip.\n\nAhead of him, a semi-truck approached in the opposite lane. Behind it, a pickup truck attempted a dangerous pass.\n\n“All I saw were headlights,” Lee said.\n\nWith only seconds to react, Lee realized the pickup wasn’t going to make it back into its lane in time.\n\n“I think it was like five seconds out,” he said. “Around three seconds, I realized he would not make it.”\n\nLee says he tried to steer away — but the Cybertruck was already moving.\n\nThe Cybertruck recorded the entire event. In the video you can clearly see there was no room for error. An overcorrection would’ve bounced Lee’s Cybertruck off the guardrail and possibly back into oncoming traffic.\n\nSlowed down frame by frame, the video shows the Cybertruck making a precise maneuver — avoiding what could have been a deadly head-on collision.\n\n“I’m so convinced it was FSD,” Lee said.\n\nThe only damage: a shattered side window and a broken mirror.\n\nTesla’s Full Self-Driving system relies entirely on cameras — mounted in door pillars, fenders, and around the vehicle — to interpret the world in real time.\n\n“I use it every day,” said Cybertruck owner Aaron George. “I feel so much safer with FSD.”\n\nGeorge demonstrated the system for CBS Austin, starting at the station’s parking lot and setting a destination to Mount Bonnell — a route filled with tricky merges, construction zones, narrow neighborhood streets, and blind intersections.\n\nAt one busy frontage road, the Cybertruck waited for the safest window of opportunity before merging smoothly into traffic.\n\nAt stoplights, the screen displayed every surrounding vehicle — cars, trucks, vans — even those behind the truck.\n\nAs the drive continued, the system navigated tight residential roads, avoided trash cans in the street, detected pedestrians, and cautiously inched forward at blind intersections before turning.\n\n“It’s pretty blinded over there,” George noted at one intersection. “It inched up, saw there were no cars, and made the turn.”\n\nWhen we arrived at Mount Bonnell, the Cybertruck located an open parking spot and backed in— without George ever touching the wheel.\n\n“It’s amazing,” he said. “Every iteration is mind-blowing.”\n\nTesla is currently rolling out Full Self-Driving (Supervised) version 14.\n\nFor many drivers, Full Self-Driving is about convenience. For Clifford Lee, it’s something far more personal.\n\n“I realized this is my second life already,” he said.\n\nLee believes a full-speed impact — closing at a combined speed of nearly 150 miles per hour — would have been unsurvivable.\n\n“There’s no chance I would have survived that,” he said.\n\nTesla’s Full Self-Driving system still requires driver supervision, and federal regulators continue to scrutinize the technology. But for one driver on a lonely highway in New Mexico, a decision made in a fraction of a second may have made all the difference.",

    "description": "Hybrids promise fuel savings and eco-friendliness, but the full story is more complicated. From costly battery replacements to limited highway efficiency, these vehicles come with trade-offs that many buyers overlook. Their environmental impact starts with resource-heavy battery production and ends with complex recycling challenges. This article breaks down the hidden costs and realities behind the hybrid hype.",
    "fullText": "The narrative around electric vehicles has hit a few speed bumps lately. Despite years of relentless marketing and massive production ramps, the EV takeover hasn't quite materialized as some predicted. Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz have both extended the life of combustion and hybrid lineups as EV demand has grown more uneven than expected. Volkswagen has said it may keep ICE models longer and even add new ICE offerings without increasing overall investment, by offsetting spending within its existing plan. Mercedes-Benz has also said it will keep upgrading combustion models and has reported higher-than-previously-planned spending on combustion-engine technology alongside delayed electrification targets.\n\nOn the other hand, hybrids are experiencing a surge in popularity, with manufacturers competing to offer a dizzying array of options. It's easy to see the appeal: they promise that sweet spot of substantial fuel savings without the existential dread of range anxiety. For many drivers, it seems like the ultimate compromise.\n\nBefore you sign on the dotted line for that virtuous hybrid, let's yank back the curtain. Hybrids, for all their supposed eco-cred and practicality, come with their own collection of dirty little secrets.\n\nLike their fully electric counterparts, many hybrids rely on lithium-ion batteries. Extracting the necessary metals, lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and graphite, requires heavy-duty mining operations. Needless to say, these aren't exactly quaint backyard digs. The environmental impact is monumental: think open-pit mining operations that resemble lunar landscapes, carving out vast sections of pristine wilderness.\n\nConsider the thirst: Some commonly cited estimates for brine-based lithium extraction in arid regions put water losses at around ~2–2.2 million liters per tonne of lithium, but water use varies widely by site and extraction method (brine vs hard-rock; definitions of ‘water used’ also differ). In arid regions, this puts immense strain on local water supplies, impacting surrounding communities and fragile ecosystems. Beyond the H2O, the chemicals used during extraction and processing are often toxic, posing a significant risk of contaminating soil and groundwater if not meticulously managed. So, that \"green\" hybrid in your driveway might have a rather large, dirty footprint you never see.\n\nBattery warranty terms vary by brand and market. In the U.S., 8 years is common, and some manufacturers offer longer coverage (for example, Toyota extended hybrid battery coverage to 10 years/150,000 miles for 2020 model-year hybrids). While many last beyond that, there's an undeniable truth: they will eventually degrade to a point where replacement is the only viable option.\n\nAnd here’s where your wallet might go into shock. Even though hybrids pack smaller battery packs than pure EVs, they are far from cheap. Hybrid batteries are usually cheaper than full EV packs, but replacements can still be expensive. Many mainstream hybrid battery replacements are often quoted in the roughly $2,000–$8,000 range depending on the vehicle, battery type, and whether the pack is new or remanufactured. By contrast, full EV battery pack replacements are commonly cited in the $5,000–$16,000+ range because the packs are much larger.\n\nIt’s not like you’ll be swapping these out in your garage with a ratchet set; this is a specialized job, meaning you’ll also be on the hook for significant labor costs and the often-overlooked expense of proper battery disposal. That \"savings at the pump\" might just be a future mortgage payment in disguise.\n\nSure, lithium-ion batteries can be recycled at the end of their life cycle. But \"can be\" and \"is readily done\" are two entirely different things. The process is anything but simple. It requires energy-intensive pyrometallurgy or complex hydrometallurgy, far from a casual drop-off at your local recycling center.\n\nCurrently, the infrastructure for large-scale, cost-effective lithium-ion battery recycling is still in its infancy. Few companies are willing to invest heavily in a process that’s both technically challenging and not yet highly profitable. This means it will be a while before someone cracks the code on how to recycle these power packs on a scale large enough to have a significant, positive environmental impact. If you're having a shop replace your high-voltage hybrid battery, Battery handling and end-of-life pathways vary by region and program; recycling exists but can be costly and logistically complex, which can affect what a shop charges for handling.” (No citation needed; this avoids a hard factual claim you can’t universally prove).\n\nThe hybrid variant of a given car model invariably carries a higher sticker price than its gas-only counterpart. While they are generally more affordable than pure EVs, that upfront premium can put them out of reach for budget-conscious buyers.\n\nMany owners justify this extra expenditure by banking on long-term fuel savings. The harsh reality? It can take several years, or even tens of thousands of miles, to actually break even on that initial investment through fuel savings alone. This is particularly true if you're one of those who replace their car every few years; you might never recoup that premium before the next vehicle purchase.\n\nOpting for a hybrid to \"reduce your carbon footprint\" is a noble intention, but it assumes you'll be running predominantly on battery power. The inconvenient truth is that most hybrids are still fundamentally internal combustion engines with electric assistance. They do burn gasoline, and they do emit CO2 into the atmosphere.\n\nFactor in the energy-intensive battery manufacturing process and the vehicle's entire lifecycle emissions (LCA), and you might find yourself with a vehicle that, by some metrics, has a higher initial carbon footprint than a conventional ICE car. Your \"eco-friendly\" commuter still chugs gas, just perhaps with a touch more virtue-signaling.\n\nSure, some hypercars like the McLaren P1 or Ferrari LaFerrari utilize hybrid technology, but that's for mind-blowing power delivery, not just economy. Your average, everyday hybrid is meticulously engineered to maximize fuel efficiency, typically pairing a modest gas engine with electric motors.\n\nThe added weight of the battery pack and electric motor, coupled with the relentless focus on efficiency, sometimes means hybrids are slower to accelerate than their pure ICE counterparts. That extra mass also compromises handling and agility, making them feel less nimble when you try to toss them into a corner. Your hybrid's \"sport mode\" is often just louder engine noise; don't expect it to win any drag races, unless it's against a kid on a scooter.\n\nWhen everything is humming along nicely, or if your hybrid is still comfortably under warranty, maintenance costs may be comparable to those of an ICE vehicle. However, that's often still more than the bare-bones servicing requirements of a pure EV.\n\nThe real financial hit comes when that warranty expires. Hybrids feature dual powertrains, meaning they combine the complexity of a conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) with high-voltage electric motors, inverters, battery management systems, and specialized cooling systems. If a high-voltage component fails out of warranty, repairs can be astronomically expensive.\n\nFinding an affordable, independent mechanic who possesses the specialized diagnostic tools and training for hybrid systems can also be a significant challenge, often forcing you to return to the pricier dealership service bay. Another hit to your savings that may put that dream car purchase back yet again, good thing you have your hybrid, I guess.\n\nHybrids are undisputed kings in city driving. Their electric motors excel in stop-and-go traffic, enabling electric-only propulsion at low speeds and recovering energy through regenerative braking. This translates to significantly lower fuel consumption than a gas-only car in urban environments.\n\nHowever, once you hit the open highway, that advantage rapidly diminishes. A hybrid's fuel consumption often rises drastically, the opposite of what you see in an ICE vehicle. At cruising speeds, the gas engine is predominantly engaged. Because it's usually a smaller, less powerful unit lugging around extra battery weight, it has to work harder than an equivalent, lighter ICE car. Your hybrid's city MPG bragging rights tend to disappear faster than a cheap date on the interstate.\n\nWe're constantly fed the narrative that hybrids are inherently more environmentally friendly, but as we've dissected, that's not necessarily true, especially if your driving mostly consists of highway miles. Additionally, if your weekly commute is a short trip to the grocery store and back, paying a significant premium for a hybrid might never yield any financial benefits.\n\nFor a hybrid to truly deliver both environmental and economic advantages, you need to cover a substantial amount of miles, predominantly in city driving or stop-and-go traffic, where the electric assist can do its best work. Otherwise, you're just driving a heavier, more complex gas car.\n\nWhen it comes to pulling heavy loads, traditional gasoline and diesel engines are still the undisputed champions. Even some new EVs, such as the Ford F-150 Lightning, Rivian R1T, and Tesla Cybertruck, are proving their mettle in this arena.\n\nHowever, for most mainstream hybrids, towing is an afterthought, if it's even allowed. The smaller internal combustion engines are not designed for sustained heavy loads, and the hybrid systems often lack the necessary cooling capacity or robust driveline components. You're clearly not going to be towing more than a Barbie convertible with something like the Prius.\n\nThe Toyota Sequoia’s maximum tow rating is up to 9,520 lbs when properly equipped (Toyota marketing often highlights up to 9,500 lbs, with exact ratings varying by configuration). The Lexus LX Hybrid is rated up to 8,000 lbs. It's good enough for some campers, but most hybrids are coming nowhere near these numbers. Meanwhile, plenty of gas-fueled SUVs and pickups can breezily tow 10,000-plus pounds, giving you a lot more variety of choices to choose from if towing is your priority. But if the Toyota Sequoia is your dream car, you're in luck.\n\nThat shiny new hybrid typically comes with a steeper insurance bill than its traditional ICE counterpart. This makes perfect sense when you consider the higher purchase price and the increased technological complexity. Insurance companies aren't charities, after all.\n\nBecause hybrid vehicles involve more expensive, specialized components (especially the battery and high-voltage wiring) and require specialized labor for repairs, insurance claims and associated repair costs tend to be higher. Insurance costs vary heavily by model and driver, but some analyses find hybrids average around single-digit percentages higher to insure than comparable gas-only vehicles (one widely cited figure is ~7% higher on average) to insure a hybrid compared to the equivalent gas-only model. That \"eco-friendly\" car also has an \"expensive-to-fix\" price tag for the insurance company.\n\nThe sophisticated lithium-ion batteries found in hybrids (and EVs) are quite particular about their operating environment. They absolutely despise extreme temperatures. When it’s scorching hot, it accelerates battery degradation, leading to a permanent loss of capacity over time. Conversely, when the mercury plummets, the battery's chemical reactions slow down, leading to a noticeable reduction in range, power output, and less efficient regenerative braking. What are they, Goldilocks? Apparently, the temperature has to be juuuust right.\n\nCold temperatures can also significantly impact charging times for plug-in hybrids, forcing the gas engine in standard hybrids to run more frequently and for longer periods to reach optimal operating temperature, thereby directly negating the fuel-saving benefits. Your \"advanced\" battery is pickier about the weather than your aunt Mildred.\n\nToyota famously revolutionized the automotive world with the original Prius hybrid, and the technology has evolved dramatically since then. However, the regulatory landscape is shifting. The EU previously set rules aiming for effectively zero-CO₂ new car sales from 2035, which would have ruled out most hybrids. However, in December 2025 the European Commission proposed changes that would replace an effective 2035 ICE ‘ban’ with a 90% tailpipe CO₂ reduction target, potentially allowing some combustion and hybrid-type vehicles to continue under certain conditions due to their reliance on an internal combustion engine.\n\nMeanwhile, pure EVs are advancing at a breakneck pace, and other alternative technologies like e-fuels (synthetic gasoline) and hydrogen fuel cells are gaining traction. It's entirely plausible that hybrids, despite their current popularity, are merely an interim technology, a bridge to a truly fossil-fuel-free future, destined to be phased out as more efficient and advanced solutions mature. Are hybrids the Betamax of the automotive future or a viable long-term solution despite all their flaws? Only time will tell. In that time, we will be crossing our fingers for your wallet.\n\nLike our content?

    "fullText": "This has to be one of the most charged debates in the U.S. auto industry this year. Scout Motors’ decision to sell cars directly to customers triggered fierce backlash from franchise dealers, highlighting long-simmering tensions between traditional retail networks and emerging direct-to-consumer business models.\n\nThe clash sharpened in Colorado, where the state Motor Vehicle Dealer Board’s decision to grant Scout a dealer license unsettled established dealers, while raising broader questions about the future of auto retailing.\n\nScout Motors is a Volkswagen Group-backed EV brand. The company deliberately pursued a sales approach more commonly associated with Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid.\n\nUnlike conventional manufacturers that rely on independent franchise dealers to sell and service vehicles, Scout intends to manage everything from reservations to delivery through its own facilities and online platform. That model promises transparent pricing, streamlined transactions, and a more controlled experience for customers.\n\nBut dealers see a threat to the industry’s longstanding franchise system, which they argue has underpinned local economies, provided guaranteed service networks, and protected consumers.\n\nOn a recent episode of Inside Automotive, industry veteran Mike Maroone, CEO of Mike Maroone Auto and former AutoNation executive, described Colorado’s regulatory approval as a “circumvention of the traditional franchise system” that undermines dealer investments and protections established over decades.\n\nHe dismissed Scout’s claims of operating separately from its corporate parent, Volkswagen, using a familiar saying to make his point: “If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck.”\n\nMaroone’s critique reflects a fundamental dispute about corporate structure and brand identity. Scout insists that it is a distinct brand with its own business model, but dealers counter that financial backing from Volkswagen and deep operational ties make that distinction superficial. They argue that allowing a manufacturer-backed brand to bypass the dealer network sets a worrying precedent that could unravel protections franchisees rely on.\n\nThe Colorado decision is especially significant because the state boasts one of the strongest electric vehicle markets in the country, with roughly 27 percent of all vehicle sales being electric. Federal and state incentives have helped fuel demand, though shifts in incentive structures have recently moderated growth. Even in a strong market, dealers feel pressured as new direct sales approaches gain regulatory footholds.\n\nMaroone has proposed that dealers consider a multipronged response that could include litigation, negotiation, and political advocacy. He underscored the value of dealer associations in unifying opposition and leveraging political capital to defend the status quo. In his view, the threat is existential rather than theoretical, with manufacturer-owned direct sales potentially eroding the economic foundations of independent dealers.\n\nThe friction goes beyond Colorado. Dealer groups nationwide, including the National Automobile Dealers Association, have pledged to challenge Scout’s direct-to-consumer strategy in courts and statehouses across the country. These challenges echo earlier disputes over Tesla and other electric vehicle makers that have similarly eschewed franchise networks, testing state franchise laws that were drafted long before internet-based sales were possible.\n\nIn some states, dealers have already escalated their opposition into litigation. For example, in Florida, Volkswagen and Audi dealers filed a lawsuit claiming Scout’s direct sales violated state law by accepting deposits for vehicles not yet in production. They contended that taking deposits constituted sales under state definitions and sought injunctions to halt the practice. The dispute underscored how legal interpretations of sales activity vary widely across states.\n\nScout’s supporters argue that the direct model aligns with evolving consumer expectations shaped by online retail and digital services. They contend that eliminating intermediaries can reduce friction and cost while offering buyers a more transparent experience. Scout’s leadership has expressed optimism about consumer demand for its Terra pickup and Traveler SUV, even as dealer pushback grows.\n\nAt its core, the conflict encapsulates a broader industry transformation. Traditional dealers emphasize their local economic impact and service capacity. Direct-to-consumer proponents highlight efficiency and modern customer engagement. As Scout and similar brands expand, the legal, economic, and political wrangling will likely continue, shaping how Americans buy vehicles in the decades ahead.",

Some final tows were needed and some salt treatments were required on the roadway.\n\nAccording to state police, several small crashes may be the culprit rather than one large pile-up.\n\nCooper, a driver who was caught in the middle of the chain of freeway crashes, said that the snow squall created a white-out condition. His car slammed underneath a semi-truck, he said - coming away injured somehow.\n\n\"It was a whiteout with no visibility and like I said, everyone was going 25 or 30 until they weren't. My car got totaled,\" he said.\n\nThe exact number of vehicles involved, is not known at this time.  All lanes were blocked.\n\n\"Some of the semis may have struggled, some of the cars may have struggled, whatever it is this is probably going to (last) the majority of the day,\" said Diane Cross of MDOT in a phone interview with FOX 2. \"At the moment we have northbound 75 closed at McNichols. Don't be surprised if we move that back to the Davison so that traffic can move freeway to freeway.\"\n\nCross said that special towing vehicles were needed for the semi-trucks.\n\n\"We have EMS, Michigan State Police out there to determine the cause.\"\n\nAccording to MDOT, the left shoulder, left lane, right center lane, right lane and right shoulder are all blocked.\n\nThe backup stretched for miles with an early estimate of at least 20 vehicles or more.\n\nRoad conditions have been challenging all day due to an active winter weather day that began with fierce winds and continued with blinding snow squalls.\n\nWest M-10 and Woodward are possible alternate routes according to Cross.\n\nPower outages have been reported by DTE Energy while a number of flights have been delayed or canceled at Metropolitan Airport in Romulus.\n\nStay with FOX 2 \n\nInformation for this report is from MDOT and multiple sources.",

    "description": "The owner of the house and her family have four cars, so they spill slightly onto the lawn when parked—which is where the town takes issue.",
    "fullText": "Parking in a driveway is about as mundane as parking can get. It's not as fancy as in a garage. It's not as potentially dangerous as parking on a street. And yet, in this story, it's led to a six-figure fine that the Florida Supreme Court has decided to let stand after several years of litigation.\n\nWhile the state's Supreme Court didn't endorse the fine, according to CBS News, it declined to review the case of Sandy Martinez, a single mother who has spent several years fighting fines that have now ballooned to $165,000 and counting. Over $100,000 of those fines relate directly to Ms. Martinez parking her cars on her driveway and slightly onto her grass. Her home isn't home to her alone; her son, daughter, and sister all live with her. All four of them have full-time jobs, and each of them has their own car. The house itself is on a corner lot, so street parking isn't available. As such, they line their cars up across the four-car driveway.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the four cars always ends up having to park slightly onto the grass in the yard that Martinez owns. According to the city of Lantana, that's unacceptable, and as a result it has fined her $250 a day for over a year.\n\nThe Institute for Justice has stepped in, and is representing Martinez. “Six-figure fines for parking on your own property are shocking,” IJ senior attorney Ari Bargil told CBS News, following the court’s decision not to take up the case. “The court’s refusal to hear Sandy’s case is a disservice to all Floridians.”\n\nFor Martinez, options moving forward are extremely limited. CBS News says Florida's Homestead Protection Act shields her from foreclosure, but it's destroyed the equity she'd built up in her home. She can't retry the case in Florida either, and given the Supreme Court's ruling, it's unlikely that a federal court would hear the case.\n\nYou Need a Torque Wrench in Your Toolbox\n\nTested: Best Car Interior Cleaners",

    "title": "This Brand Makes The Worst Cars, According To Consumer Reports",
    "description": "When looking for a car to buy, it's important to take a look at its reliability. Before you buy, here's what Consumer Reports says is the worst brand.",
    "fullText": "To say that one particular brand or company makes the worst cars is a bold statement. After all, labeling a vehicle the best or worst can be very subjective. Some buyers, for example, might be willing to deal with less-than-stellar long-term reliability in exchange for the performance or image you get with a European luxury brand. Others might happily trade performance and excitement for the peace of mind that comes with great reliability.\n\nHowever, when it comes to objectively ranking current car brands from best to worst by using the same standards, Consumer Reports is hard to beat. CR uses a variety of its test metrics and survey results to compile a regularly updated list of the industry's best and worst brands. The latest version, which includes 31 different brands, has ranked Jeep as the worst of the bunch.\n\nThis is a bit disconcerting, given that Jeep is one of America's most storied vehicle brands, with lots of loyal fans and owners. But it's also not a surprising result, given that Jeep has had a lot of well-publicized recall and safety issues recently. The result also shows quite starkly that just because a vehicle is capable or exciting off the showroom floor, it doesn't mean it's necessarily going to be a smart purchase when it comes to long-term ownership satisfaction.\n\nConsumer Reports comes up with its best and worst brand rankings by looking at several different factors, including reliability and owner satisfaction surveys, initial road test reviews, and safety ratings. And in Jeep's defense, some of the negatives that CR considers (poor fuel economy for example) are likely already known and considered by buyers going in, and are probably accepted as a trade-off for Jeep's famous off-road capability.  However, what's harder to defend is Jeep's position at the very bottom of CR's owner satisfaction rankings, with only about half of current Jeep owners saying they would buy one again.\n\nBeyond Consumer Reports rankings, the relatively poor quality and questionable reliability of Jeep products are not a big secret. The brand has been plagued with high-profile recalls lately, especially on its 4xe hybrid models. In the last year alone, Jeep 4xes have been hit with some huge recalls, including one with a risk of complete engine failures and even worse, a fire risk from faulty 4xe battery cells. And that's a big deal because it's not just a mechanical failure, but a safety risk to both the vehicle and the house or garage where it's parked. Additionally, casual surveys of mechanics, for example, have shown Jeep to be one of the more trouble-prone brands, with other Stellantis-owned names (like Dodge and Chrysler) also joining their list of brands that 'pay the rent'.\n\nEven from a high-level view, the reliability and quality issues around Jeep are sad to see. Because Jeep isn't just another car brand trying to get its piece of the pie. Jeep is one of the American auto industry's most storied names, and one that's heavily tied into America's adventurous spirit. Increasingly, though, that adventurous spirit has as much to do with recalls and repairs as it does tackling remote trails and exploring far-off wilderness.\n\nThis is not all to say that you should completely avoid buying or leasing a new Jeep, but the sketchy track record of reliability, and the possibility of your vehicle spending a lot of time at the dealership is absolutely something to consider. Where Consumer Reports' ratings become more of a red flag warning is when it comes to buying a used Jeep. Because it's one thing to have a trouble-prone vehicle that's under factory warranty, and another thing to have an out-of-warranty vehicle where you take on significant financial risk if repairs are needed.\n\nIt should be said, though, that Jeep's less-than-great reputation for reliability is not a new thing, and that hasn't stopped many hardcore Jeep fans and otherwise happy owners from enjoying their vehicles.   On the other hand, if you are not in the mood for risk-taking and are wondering about Consumer Reports' picks for best reliability, you'll not surprisingly find a couple of long-time favorite Japanese brands topping the most recent rankings.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "description": "SUVs remain popular, but with a multitude of models, it can be hard to choose the best one. These SUVs are some of the best, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
    "fullText": "Sport utility vehicles, or SUVs, are vehicles that have the tough frame of a truck but provide enough interior room for multiple passengers and cargo. And they aren't just popular among retirees with grandchildren or people fond of bulk shopping trips to stock up on items at Costco. There were $528 billion worth of SUV transactions in 2024 across the globe, a figure that is expected to swell to just over $876 billion by 2032, per Stellar Market Research. And SUVs and trucks were the best selling vehicles of the first three quarters of 2025 in the United States, according to Car and Driver.\n\nAs a byproduct of their popularity, SUVs come in so many forms and models of varying quality that it is enough to put a car shopper into a fetal position of indecision, especially if you don't want to end up with a popular yet unreliable SUV. Fortunately, there's Kelley Blue Book, which has been a valuable source for automobile buyers since 1926. In early 2025, Kelley Blue Book came out with its Best Buy awards, which included Hyundai Kona, Honda CR-V, Kia Telluride, Ford Expedition, and Kia EV9. To give you a complete picture, we've included analyses and reviews from other online car sources in the roundup below.\n\nRated as the best subcompact SUV, the Hyundai Kona is described by Kelley Blue Book as a roomy, comfortable, fuel-efficient vehicle that can get about 31 miles for the gallon. With a starting price of about $25,900, Hyundai Kona can seat five people with just over 38 inches of leg room and can carry 25.5 cubic feet of cargo, or a maximum of 63.7 cubic feet when the second-row seats are folded down. The vehicle comes equipped with a 12.3-inch infotainment display and an optional all-wheel drive. Plus, the 2025 Kona is equipped with standard safety features such as collision warning with automatic emergency braking and blind-spot monitoring.\n\nYet according to Edmunds, the 2025 Hyundai Kona's acceleration abilities are \"underwhelming,\" while its suspension is not all that great, making it a less-than-ideal vehicle for off-roading (the model still got a 7.8 out of 10 rating). Consumer Reports, though, rated the 2025 Hyundai Kona overall reliability at 41 out of 100, about average for that model year.\n\nIn terms of costs to fix and maintain, CarEdge estimated that a Hyundai Kona will cost $8,463 over its first ten years, which is $297 more than non-luxury SUVs. As for how quickly this car can depreciate, CarEdge says it will lose 42% of its value after five years. That's better than the 53% depreciation of a Wagoneer, a popular Jeep with terrible resale value.\n\nKelley Blue Book compared the 2025 Honda CR-V — the winner of the best compact SUV category — to the brightest start in the sky for its quality, tech features, and the 76.5 cubic feet of cargo space it can provide once you fold down the rear seats. Though compact, the CR-V provides 41 inches of legroom for its rear seats along with reclining backs. And its hybrid versions can give up to 40 miles per gallon.\n\nBut where the CR-V truly excels is in its resale value, which Kelley Blue Book reports can fetch thousands of dollars more than its competitors due to the Honda brand's reputation for reliability. CarEdge agreed, putting its depreciation at just 29% over its first five years.\n\nWith a starting price of $31,495, the Honda CR-V costs $7,696 to fix and maintain in its first ten years of service, which is $530 less than the average for other popular SUV models. Also: Car and Driver called the 2025 model year a solid vehicle that's high in demand, and Edmunds gave it a 7.1 out of 10. However, this model was part of a recall ordered on Honda vehicles by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for potential fuel leaks and possibly incorrectly manufactured bad steering gearboxes.\n\nThe winner of the best midsize SUV for the sixth year in a row, the 2025 Kia Telluride has a three-row configuration that can seat eight, a Mercedez-Benz-quality dual-display infotainment touchscreen, 21 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row, and a total of 87 cubic feet with the two rear rows folded down, according to Kelley Blue Book. The model, which starts at about $37,800, also comes with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, and a host of other safety features.\n\nIn terms of reliability, Consumer Reports gives it an average with a score of 60 out of 100, although the vehicle also scored 72 out of 100 for owner satisfaction. Edmunds gives it a 7.1 out of 10 rating, while Car and Driver stated that Kia Telluride's standard features approach luxury standards. As for its resale value, the Kia Telluride will depreciate 51% in its first five years, according to CarEdge, and will cost $8,730 to maintain and fix in its first 10 years, which is $564 more than typical SUVs.\n\nThe '25 Ford Expedition took Kelley Blue Book's best full-size SUV award for its three-row spacious interior with plentiful cupholders and USB-C ports, ability to tow trailers up to 9,600 pounds, and a variety of trims, like the Expedition Tremor, that are great for transverse unpaved trails. With a starting price of $64,515, it has a mobile Wi-Fi hotspot that allows people to stream music and audiobooks as well as videos when parked. There is even a Bluetooth controller for people to play online games. The second row has tablet holders on the back of the front seat headrests, and there is a 13.2-inch infotainment touchscreen for navigation and climate control. The vehicle also comes with a safety package that includes a 360-degree camera, emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and blind-spot and lane-keeping assist functions.\n\nOn the downside, according to Consumer Reports, the 2025 Ford Expedition is less reliable than the average car, with a reliability rating of 30 out of 100. It also costs $10,226 to maintain a Ford Expedition model in its first ten years of ownership, which is $2,060 more than other popular SUV models, per CarEdge. Ford Expeditions also depreciate 59% in five years, with a ranking of 164 out of 185 models analyzed by CarEdge for resale value.\n\nLarge enough to seat seven people, the Kia EV9 won Kelley Blue Book's Best Buy spot for 3-row EVs. An electric midsized SUV with prices that start at $56,395, the Kia EV9 can seat seven people comfortably, has a maximum range of 304 miles, and can get 150 miles worth of range after charging for only 15 minutes.\n\nEdmunds gave the model 8.2 out of 10, but Consumer Reports deemed the 2025 Kia EV9 less reliable than other cars of the same model year. There were also three recalls ordered by NHTSA because of a badly welded gear shift that causes the vehicle to lose power (342 vehicles for year 2025); possible missing bolts in the second and third row seats (22,883 vehicles for years 2024 and 2025); and a failing instrument panel screen for speed and other info (14,163 vehicles for years 2024 and 2025).\n\nBut if those issues are addressed by dealerships free of charge, as expected, the Kia EV9 is projected to cost $5,237 to maintain and fix in its first 10 years, which is $2,929 better than the average SUV, per CarEdge. However, in five years it will lose 52% of its value.\n\nUnlock your financial potential. Add Money Digest to your preferred sources for smart money insights!",

    "description": "Solid-state batteries are poised to transform everything from electric cars to consumer electronics, and represent a transformational leap in energy storage.",
    "fullText": "Solid-state batteries charge in a fraction of the time, run cooler, and pack more energy into less space than traditional lithium-ion versions.\n\nA new review from the University of California, Riverside, published in Nano Energy, explains why this technology is poised to transform everything from electric cars to consumer electronics, and represents a major leap in energy storage.\n\nThese batteries replace the flammable liquid found in standard versions with a solid material that is safer and far more efficient. Where today’s batteries may take 30 to 45 minutes to reach 80% charge, solid-state models can cut that time to 12 minutes, and in some cases, as little as three.\n\nLead author Cengiz Ozkan, a professor of mechanical engineering at UCR, said the benefits come down to chemistry and engineering. “By removing the liquid and using stable solid materials instead, we can safely push more electricity into the battery at once, without the risks of overheating or fires,” he said.\n\nConventional lithium-ion batteries move lithium ions, the particles that carry electric charge, through a liquid. But that liquid can degrade over time, limit charging speed, and pose fire risks. Solid-state batteries use a solid material instead, which offers a safer and more stable environment for lithium ions to move through. This enables faster, more efficient charging with fewer safety concerns.\n\nThe solid inside these batteries is known as a solid-state electrolyte. The review highlights three main types: sulfide-based, oxide-based, and polymer-based. Each type has strengths: some allow ions to move faster, others offer better long-term stability or are easier to manufacture. One standout group, sulfide-based electrolytes, performs almost as well as the liquid in current batteries, but without the downsides.\n\nThe researchers also describe the tools scientists now use to watch batteries work in real time. Techniques like neutron imaging and high-powered X-rays let researchers see how lithium moves inside a battery as it charges and discharges. This helps identify areas where the lithium gets stuck or where unwanted structures called “dendrites” start to grow. Dendrites are tiny, needle-like formations that can cause a battery to short-circuit or fail.\n\nUnderstanding these inner workings is key to making better batteries. “These imaging tools are like an MRI for batteries,” Ozkan said. “They let us watch the battery’s vital signs and make smarter design choices.”\n\nSolid-state batteries also tend to use lithium more efficiently. Many designs feature a lithium metal layer that can store more energy in less space than the graphite layers used in current batteries. This means solid-state batteries can be lighter and smaller while still powering devices for just as long, or longer.\n\nWhile conventional lithium-ion batteries typically begin to show noticeable degradation after approximately 5–8 years of use in electric vehicles, solid-state batteries could remain functional for 15–20 years or more, depending on usage and environmental factors.\n\n“Traditional lithium-ion batteries, while revolutionary, are reaching their performance and safety limits as electric vehicles, renewable energy grids, portable electronics, and aerospace systems become more widespread and demanding,” Ozkan said.\n\nOzkan said solid-state batteries could also play a pivotal role in the future of interstellar travel and space exploration.\n\nDue to their thermal and chemical stability, these batteries are better suited to withstand extreme temperatures and radiation conditions in outer space. They’re also able to store more power in less space, which is critical for missions where every cubic centimeter counts. And without liquid electrolytes, they would be more reliable in closed, oxygen-controlled environments like spacecraft or planetary bases.\n\nThe researchers’ goal with this review was to guide researchers and technologists in accelerating the development, scalability, and real-world deployment of solid-state systems.\n\nBut challenges remain. Making these batteries on a large scale is still difficult and expensive. The paper offers a roadmap for solving these problems, including developing better materials, refining how the battery parts interact, and improving factory techniques to make production easier.\n\n“Solid-state batteries are moving closer to reality every day,” Ozkan said. “Our review shows how far the science has come and what steps are needed next to make these batteries available for everyday use.”\n\n(Cover image of solid-state batteries: Just_Super/Getty)",

    "title": "How Reliable Are Volkswagens? Here's What Consumer Reports Says",
    "description": "Consumer Reports amasses quite a bit of data about automotive manufacturers and surveys owners about reliability. Here's how Volkswagen currently ranks.",
    "fullText": "Volkswagen is one of the oldest and biggest car manufacturers in the world. For almost nine decades, the brand has lived through the early dominance of the Beetle, its rise as an automotive giant through acquisitions of Audi and Porsche, and, more recently, Dieselgate. VW's modern car lineup includes compact cars, SUVs, crossovers, and electric vehicles like the Volkswagen ID Buzz, which has the best vibes of any new car on sale. Within this large lineup of cars, specs and features vary — but how reliable are Volkswagens in general?\n\nAccording to a Consumer Reports (CR) 2025 reliability survey ranking 26 different major brands, Volkswagen ranks 16th. The Golf GTI is the most reliable model in the current VW lineup, while the compact Taos ranks as the least reliable. These numbers place VW slightly below average. RepairPal ranks VW reliability numbers at 3.5 out of 5.0, which puts it as 12th across 32 different brands. These numbers tell you something, but not everything. Individual cars can perform very differently, so buyer beware: Picking the right VW model matters.\n\nThe ratings CR provides are based on real owner experiences in the past 12 months. Specifically, CR compiled data on 380,000 vehicles and separated that data into 20 different trouble areas that include the engine, transmission, in-car electronics, body hardware, and EV components. According to CR, the Taos \"is less reliable than other cars from the same model year.\" It isn't all bad ratings for Volkswagen, though.\n\nRepairPal is an independent automotive data company that bases its reliability ratings on millions of real-world repair invoices, historical statistics, and predictive data modeling. Based on their assessments, the Jetta, Golf, and Passat are \"above average\" in reliability, while the Tiguan and the Golf GTI are \"average.\" To further complicate things, the picture shifts slightly when looking at used cars. In a separate 2025 CR study of used car reliability, Volkswagen is placed 13th out of 26 brands.\n\nThat placement isn't a complete game changer, but it's a bit better than VW's rating with new vehicles. In another hit to VW, a dependability study from J.D. Power that tracks reliability ratings for cars up to three years of age, placed Volkswagen at the very bottom of all brands, with an average of 285 problems across 100 vehicles. However, VW Jetta reliability is rated \"Great\" while the Golf GTI is only \"Average.\" The Taos — one of the least satisfying SUVs you can buy – is also \"Average.\"\n\nVolkswagen is a major player in the U.S. car market, consistently ranking among the top-selling automotive brands. More than 10 years after the PR disaster that was Dieselgate, Volkswagen sold 316,504 vehicles in the U.S. in 2024 — a 19.4% year‑over‑year increase — suggesting that, despite its underwhelming projected reliability and past scandals, VW is a strong choice with buyers.\n\nVW's best-selling models with U.S. buyers are the Tiguan, the Atlas, and the Jetta. The usual benefit VW enjoys compared to its German counterparts is that it offers German engineering at a cheaper price. VW does not match Mercedes, Audi, and BMW in terms of luxury, despite some higher-end models, but it does share some of its platforms with Audi. This means that Volkswagen, although it isn't as premium as Mercedes or BMW, does not suffer from costs typically associated with luxury brands.\n\nAccording to RepairPal, the average annual repair costs for a VW are $676. Compared to premium brands like BMW at $968 and Audi at $987, Volkswagens seem like a practical choice, especially if you are worried about long-term repair costs. On the economy-side of the spectrum, Toyota, the brand with the best-selling passenger car of 2025, averages $441 in annual repair costs.\n\nWant more like this?
