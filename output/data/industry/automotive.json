    "description": "Buying a car that's reliable will save you from serious headaches later on. According to Consumer Reports, this is one of the most reliable luxury vehicles.",
    "fullText": "The Lexus NX was listed by Consumer Reports as one of the ten most reliable vehicles. According to the CR report, published in December 2024, the 2025-year model got a score of 78 out of a possible 100 in the reliability category, placing it in seventh place. That might sound a tad underwhelming, especially when you consider the fact that the 2024 Lexus NX model received a score of 95 in terms of reliability while the 2021 model received a score of 94. Keep in mind, these are outliers. The 2023 model rated a worrisome 58, down from 2022's Lexus NX which had a reliability score of 66.\n\nThat being said, the Lexus NX has generally achieved solid reliability scores from CR (over 70, apart from '22 and '23) since it first debuted in 2015 which shouldn't be too surprising since its part of the Lexus brand. In 2025, Lexus ranked the highest in terms of vehicle dependability for the third year in a row, according to J.D. Power. Whereas the average vehicle in that survey experienced 202 problems per 100 vehicles over the course of three years, the Lexus vehicles had just 104 problems per 100 vehicles.\n\nBest of all, while the Lexus NX is a luxury SUV it isn't all that expensive compared to other luxury brands. The car sells at an average of $50,896, which is slightly below the average price for a new vehicle of any kind ($50,080) in September 2025. The average price for a luxury compact SUV, as of March 2025, was $52,933.\n\nOn average, the Lexus NX costs $7,712 in maintenance costs for its first 10 years of service. That's $4,741 less than the average luxury SUV model. Also: There is only a 21.14% chance the Lexus NX will need a huge fix within those ten years. That beats other luxury SUVs by 17.37%. Such low car shop rates would appear to be a testimony to the Lexus NX's overall reliability, but again some model years are better than others.\n\nThere were also some recalls implemented by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for issues that included a back over prevention rearview camera that didn't work (model years 2022-2025), a deactivated airbag at the steering column (2023 and 2024), a head restraint on the driver's and passenger's side that could be accidentally removed (2023 and 2024), a defective second-row center seatbelt (2025), and a parking service brake that won't engage while in park (2022). There was also an electrical issue with some Lexus NX450 hybrid electric vehicles that sometimes caused them to overheat while recharging in temperatures below 41 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nRecall issues are supposed to be fixed by dealers free of charge. Assuming you can verify that those issues were taken care of, acquiring a preowned Lexus NX might not be a bad idea if you're trying to decide whether to buy new or used. You can save an average of $17,900 acquiring a reliable Lexus NX that is two years old while maintaining confidence it still has years of use ahead of it.\n\nOn the flip side, a Lexus NX may not be as good a used car investment as the Lexus RX 350 because the Lexus NX loses 47% of its value after five years while a Lexus RX 350 depreciates just 35% in that time. The Lexus NX depreciation rate is also higher than that of the overall Lexus brand, which averages at 38.3% over five years.\n\nIt's no secret that new cars depreciate quickly after you buy them, but among luxury car brands Lexus is the very best when it comes to its ability to retain resale value. A new vehicle usually depreciates 55% over five years, so the Lexus NX's 47% depreciation rate is still above average — unlike the popular Jeep Wagoneer, which has terrible resale value.\n\nUnlock your financial potential.

    "description": "If your car ended up on this list, I think it would be best if you headed down to the comments and explained yourself.",
    "fullText": "We all know cars are quite expensive right now. The average new car will now set you back over $50,000, which isn't ideal for anyone. That means there are plenty of terrible car values out there, and that idea is what led me to the question I asked you all last week.\n\nI wanted to know which car on sale today is the worst value. What car provides so little for the money it costs that you cannot wrap your head around why anyone could possibly buy one? How was a dealer salesman so slimy or good at his job that they were able to convince someone to buy that piece of crap?\n\nI know. It's mind-boggling. But in any case, I'll stop yapping. How about you all drop down below and check out what new cars your fellow Jalops consider to be the worst values out there. If your car ended up on this list, I think it would be best if you headed down to the comments and explained yourself.\n\nA car of many flaws, but the biggest one is the existence of X5 M - same performance, better comfort, better looks, half the price.\n\nIt's a $70K + EV with inferior performance to EVs that cost $20k less. You're just paying a massive premium for nostalgia and getting nothing in terms of range and performance, not to mention it's often said that the interior materials are industrial at best.\n\nCybertruck of course. 6 figure purchase price, gets out performed by vehicles half the cost. Worse, you can't sell it or trade it in without giving it away... nobody wants a used Cybertruck. Buy F150, Ram 1500, Chevy Silverado, and they will do more for much less and have a much better resale value.\n\nPut down the pitchforks and hear me out...\n\nThe base Porsche 911 now starts at $134,650 (including destination) before options for the 992.2 generation (let's just ignore the ADMs and allocation games that dealers are playing). Yes, that gets you legendary sports car with sublime handling and Porsche build quality, but it also only nets you 388 hp and a basic interior that wouldn't look out of place in a mid-trim level Mazda. Start adding options and you can very quickly approach $200k. Porsche has gone bonkers with its pricing the last few years, especially on the 911. It's a great car, but at that price it's just not a great value anymore.\n\nYes I'm still bitter about the price and power level. Really would have liked one for a daily driver. Toyota needs to step up and make a GR Prius.\n\nThe Ineos Grenadier. 80k+ for a Land Rover knock off. If you're going to spend that much, just get a Land Rover Classic. About the same cost, but at least it's a real land rover.\n\nThe current AMG GT 2 door - yes, the car I adore, is...not the worst value per se, but definitely over priced for sure, however the worst value for the money in that model has to be the GT43. Also why they made the GT into a 4 door car with the same name is also stupid, so now I have to specify which variant I want, which is annoying.\n\nBut why on Earth is there a 4 banger version for the 2 door? And why on Europa, does it start at $106K? Are you dumb!? It has the same 0-60 as a stock Evo X MR that costed less than half it's price. It's the same thing that happened with the C63, only thank the lord Mercedes wasn't dumb enough to put that drivetrain in the GT63. But it is absolutely inexcusable to charge $106K for a mild hybrid 4 banger, especially when the CLE 53 exists which looks dam good in it's own right, and comes in a 3 liter inline 6 with mild hybrid for...76 Thousand dollars! The GT43 is still a pretty car, but a pretty car for posers. Mercedes...what are we doing? Consumers that bought that thing...what are you doing?\n\nUnpopular opinion but I would say most new Toyota vehicles are way overpriced for what you get. A new Tacoma can run you up to 50 - 60 grand. That is what a full sized truck used to cost. Think about all that you could buy on the used market for the price. You could buy 2 Ford Maveriks for 30k. Is the Tacoma twice the truck? For what most people use it for no way.\n\ncurrently, the Z. It's just a gussied up 370Z with false rarity and dealer markups that dont make sense because it isnt that desirable.\n\nLamborghini Urus. It's an Audi, so there's that. Hardly anyone outside of your cult will know what it is, so there's that, too. At the end of the day it's a quarter million dollar station wagon for your kids to spill their juice boxes in the back seat.\n\nI was just in Palm Beach and the amount of Cullinan's there was downright baffling - and I had this exact thought of, what does a Cullinan do that is worth $300K more than a fully equipped Range Rover or Bentayga? And the only thing I could come up with is: Status. Those people there thrive on social hierarchy, and I suppose can justify the gargantuan price. To me, though - it's absurd.\n\nIf I had that level of money, I'd still be driving my old 4Runner or perhaps a similar era Landcruiser. Why care what the neighbors think unless they're paying my bills? To each their own.\n\nWant more like this?

    "description": "The auto conglomerate, which owns Jeep and Ram, confirmed that it would bring the Fiat Topolino — a 2.5-meter-long electric tiny car — to the US.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has opened the door for tiny cars to be sold in the US — and now Stellantis is bringing an Italian mini car to American shores.\n\nThe auto conglomerate, which owns Jeep and Ram, confirmed on Monday that it would bring the Fiat Topolino — a 2.5-meter-long electric tiny car — to the US.\n\nSpeaking at an event in Michigan, Fiat CEO Olivier Francois said the Topolino's display appearances in the US had sparked \"tremendous excitement,\" adding that the company would share more details about the tiny car's US launch next year.\n\nThe Topolino, which means \"little mouse\" in Italian, is a major departure from the gas-guzzling big trucks that dominate US roads.\n\nBuilt by Italian brand Fiat, the compact city car has a max range of around 47 miles and a top speed of 28 miles per hour.\n\nWeighing less than a golf cart, it's technically classified as an electric quadricycle rather than a car, meaning that it can be driven from age 14 in some European countries.\n\nThe Topolino is available throughout Europe and costs around 9,900 euros ($11,500) in its home market of Italy. Its impending US launch follows a sudden burst of support for tiny cars from an unlikely source — Trump.\n\nThe US president expressed admiration for Japan's pint-sized Kei cars after a recent trip to the country.\n\nTrump described the mini electric models, which are hugely popular in Japan, as \"very cute\" and \"beautiful,\" and said last week that he had loosened regulations to allow manufacturers to build them in the US.\n\nA Stellantis spokesperson told CNBC the announcement of the Topolino's US launch was unrelated to Trump's comments. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nKei cars have developed an enthusiastic cult following in the US, but the vehicles don't meet federal auto standards and can only be imported if they're over 25 years old.\n\nKei cars also face a patchwork of state regulations, with some states limiting them to low speeds or prohibiting them from being driven on public roads entirely.",
