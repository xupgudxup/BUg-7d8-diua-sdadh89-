    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — Chinese demand for foreign luxury cars is waning as customers opt for more affordable Chinese brand models, often sold at big discounts, catering to their taste for fancy electronics and comfort.\n\nThat is bad news for European carmakers like Porsche, Aston Martin, Mercedes-Benz and BMW that have long dominated the upper reaches of the world's largest auto market.\n\nA slowing economy hits the luxury market\n\nA prolonged property downturn in China has left many consumers with little appetite for big purchases. Meanwhile, the well-to-do are becoming increasingly shy about publicly displaying their wealth, said Paul Gong, UBS head of China Automotive Industry Research.\n\nMany car buyers have been swayed by a 20,000 yuan ($2,830) trade-in subsidy offered by the Chinese government for purchasing electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. People tended to purchase cheaper, entry-level cars where the discount will count more and those cars are mostly Chinese made, Gong said.\n\n“Slowing economic growth is one key driver behind weaker demand for premium cars,” said Claire Yuan, director of corporate ratings for China autos at S&P Global Ratings, referring to a segment that typically counts car brands such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW.\n\nThe market share of premium car sales in China, usually priced above 300,000 yuan ($42,400), more than doubled between 2017 and 2023 to about 15% of total sales, S&P said.\n\nThat trend is now reversing. The share of premium cars sales fell to 14% in 2024 and to 13% in the first nine months of 2025, S&P said.\n\nChinese automakers take a bigger bite\n\nWhile luxury auto sales have slowed, Chinese manufacturers, including electric vehicle maker BYD, have become more aggressive than many Western brands in technological innovation, frequently rolling out new electric vehicles and hybrids at cheaper prices, including premium vehicles, analysts said.\n\n“Their (Chinese carmakers’) products are more competitive and more affordable even in the premium segment,” Yuan said. “That’s why these foreign brands are gradually losing momentum.”\n\nThe Chinese brands’ share of passenger car sales climbed to almost 70% in the first 11 months of this year, according to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. It reported Thursday that German brands held a 12% share, Japanese brands around 10% and U.S. brands nearly 6%.\n\nBYD already has overtaken Volkswagen as the biggest car seller in China in recent years. BYD is so far the best selling car brand this year in China for “new energy vehicles,” which include electric vehicles and hybrids, according to the China Passenger Car Association. BYD had cut prices of its electric and plug-in hybrid models by up to 34%, putting pressure on major rivals like Geely and Leapmotor.",

    "title": "I asked Rivian execs why an adventure-brand EV needs AI and self-driving. To them, they're logical next steps.",
    "description": "Rivian executives said AI and autonomy not only makes sense for their company, but also reflects the direction of the entire auto industry.",
    "fullText": "If there were a Venn diagram of a driver who wants an adventure-focused car with off-roading capability on one side and a driver who wants a software-centric, computer-first car that could drive itself on the other, would there be a lot of overlap between the two circles?\n\nOn Thursday, Rivian hosted an \"Autonomy & AI Day\" at the company's research and development hub in Palo Alto, where hundreds witnessed the EV maker's grand leap into the future: a highly integrated AI assistant and fully autonomous driving capability, all powered by Rivian's very own silicon chip.\n\nWassym Bensaid, Rivian's Chief Software Officer, called the move a \"profound platform shift which changes our product and everything we do at the company.\"\n\nBensaid is among the key executives leading the charge toward Rivian's \"AI-defined vehicle,\" along with James Philbin, VP of Autonomy & AI, and Vidya Rajagopalan, Senior VP of Rivian's electrical hardware division.\n\nDuring the event, I had the chance to talk to Bensaid and Philbin about the pivot and whether it makes sense for a company that, since its inception, has branded itself as an adventure-forward vehicle, or if this is just a response to consumer demand.\n\nPhilbin, who was a director at Zoox and Waymo before joining Rivian in 2022, told me that pursuing autonomy has long been part of the company's trajectory rather than an overnight decision.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, Philbin sees a rising \"tide\" in consumer demand for some level of autonomy — especially as robotaxis become mainstream.\n\n\"We are starting to see that autonomy is a really important purchase decision with customers, and especially customers who come from vehicles with maybe high levels of autonomy,\" he said. \"They don't go back.\"\n\nPhilbin said that having a high-level advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) was cited as one of the \"top three purchase reasons\" for Rivian customers. However, the demand will extend to all automakers, he said.\n\n\"I just see it becoming such a key purchase driver for vehicles going forward,\" Philbin said. \"And I think every OEM will have to deliver these features to customers in some way.\"\n\nA year ago, Bensaid told me that the future of cars would be hands-free, and that using buttons or fiddling with the touchscreen would be \"an anomaly.\"\n\n\"It's a bug, it's not a feature,\" he said at the time. \"Ideally, you would want to interact with your car through voice. And the problem today is that most voice assistants are just broken.\"\n\nThursday's demonstration of the Rivian Assistant, an in-car AI assistant that can control certain vehicle functions, brought Bensaid's vision to life. I saw the Rivian Assistant pull up navigation directions and control the direction of the air vents through voice control.\n\nBensaid told me at the event that \"cars and automotive are probably the killer app for AI.\"\n\n\"In your 30-minute or 45-minute commute every day, you want to get your time back, you want to really take control of your time,\" he said.\n\nWhen I asked the software chief where the overlap was between Rivian's adventure brand and its AI push, Bensaid said the company \"inspires many types of customers.\"\n\n\"I think at the core of the brand, Rivian wants people to explore the world,\" he said, and that there were different ways to do so, whether that's by going off-road or exploring the world through technology.\n\nAt the same time, Bensaid said, \"At heart, we are a technology company, so technology is really a big part of the user experience, how we see ourselves, and how we present ourselves to the world.\"\n\nBensaid's statement touches upon another key focus beyond the automaker's line-up of premium trucks and SUVs: software licensing.\n\nRivian's joint venture with the German automotive giant Volkswagen was a clear sign of its intent to license its software platform to other automakers in the future.\n\nPart of the tech will include self-driving capabilities, which the entire automotive world — legacy and startup — is exploring, Steve Man, senior auto analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, told me.\n\n\"We don't really know at the end of the day if there's going to be a huge mass adoption,\" Man said of autonomy. Still, the analyst adds that \"it's a must\" for car makers to pursue.\n\nSales of Tesla's Full Self-Driving Supervised reflect that uncertainty. CEO Elon Musk has presented FSD as the key driver of the company's valuation even though the adoption rate of FSD remains at around 12%, Vaibhav Taneja, Tesla's Chief Financial Officer, said in October.\n\nThe automotive industry still remains bullish on autonomy and AI.\n\nNissan partnered with UK-based Wayve, which develops software for advanced driver assistance systems. General Motors teased plans for an eyes-off driving system for 2028. And Mercedes unveiled a hands-off, eyes-off ADAS a few years ago.\n\nA recent Bloomberg Intelligence report said that nearly half of C-suite auto executives surveyed said they expect AI to lift sales and profits by 9% over the next two to three years.\n\n\"From a business perspective, you don't know if it is going to take off, but you need to invest some money now so that you're not behind,\" Man said, \"and you have the opportunity to roll it out if it is something that people want.\"",

    "fullText": "The automotive world has given us incredible engineering feats, iconic designs, and moments that changed transportation forever. But alongside these achievements are puzzles that have captivated enthusiasts for decades.\n\nFrom legendary prototypes that vanished without a trace to engineering decisions that still spark heated debates, these mysteries remind us that car history isn't always written in stone.\n\nSome questions may never have definitive answers, and honestly, that's part of what makes them so fascinating to discuss over a wrench and a cold drink in the garage. The following mysteries have different endings: while some have a pretty possible answer, others still have us scratching our heads.\n\nSteve McQueen's 1968 Highland Green Mustang GT from Bullitt became one of the most famous movie cars ever, but for decades, nobody knew where it was. Two identical Mustangs were used for filming, and while one was long believed to have met its end as a battered camera car, the hero car seemingly disappeared into thin air.\n\nThe automotive community spent years hunting for it, with rumors placing it everywhere from Mexico to a Kentucky junkyard. Then in 2018, it reappeared at the Detroit Auto Show, having been quietly owned by the same family since 1974.\n\nThe owner had kept it largely original, complete with movie modifications and that iconic roar, proving that sometimes the best hiding place is simply staying quiet.\n\nPreston Tucker’s 1948 Tucker ’48 Sedan was genuinely ahead of its time, featuring a rear-mounted engine, four-wheel independent suspension, and innovative safety features that Detroit wouldn’t adopt for decades. Tucker had originally promoted disc brakes and fuel injection, but those ideas were dropped before production.\n\nBut his ambitious venture collapsed amid controversy, SEC investigations, and allegations that were later dismissed in court. While Tucker was acquitted of all fraud charges, his company was already finished, leaving only 51 cars ever produced.\n\nWhether it was a case of an innovator crushed by established industry forces or a business that simply overreached remains one of automotive history's great debates.\n\nEveryone knows the 1966 Batmobile was built from a Lincoln Futura concept car by legendary customizer George Barris, but the question of what engine actually propelled it has caused decades of confusion. The Lincoln Futura originally had a 368-cubic-inch Lincoln V8, but various sources have claimed everything from keeping the original engine to swapping in a 390 or even a 429.\n\nBarris himself gave different answers over the years, and the car underwent modifications throughout its life. Three additional Batmobiles were built for promotional tours, each potentially configured differently, further muddying the waters.\n\nFor a car that's supposed to represent cutting-edge crime-fighting technology, its actual mechanical specifications remain surprisingly mysterious.\n\nGeneral Motors' EV1, launched in 1996, was the first mass-produced electric vehicle of the modern era and developed a passionate following among its lessees. When GM abruptly canceled the program in 2003, they made the controversial decision to reclaim and crush nearly every single vehicle, despite protests from drivers who wanted to purchase them.\n\nThe company cited parts, liability, and lack of profitability as reasons, but the dramatic destruction of a functioning, beloved product seemed extreme to many. Only about 40 EV1s survived, most of them deactivated and donated to museums and universities with their powertrains disabled so they couldn’t be legally driven on public roads, although a tiny handful have been kept or made operational again under very controlled circumstances.\n\nThe whole saga spawned documentaries and conspiracy theories, making the EV1's fate one of the strangest chapters in automotive history.\n\nThere's a popular story that Enzo Ferrari viewed road car production as merely a necessary evil to finance his true passion of racing. The famous quote attributed to him suggests he built and sold road cars only because he couldn't fund his racing operation any other way.\n\nWhile this makes for a compelling narrative that certainly captures Ferrari's racing-first mentality, historians debate whether it oversimplifies a more complex business reality. Ferrari clearly prioritized racing above all else, but the company's business model required both sides to function.\n\nWhether Enzo truly saw customers as merely checkbooks for his racing dreams or understood the symbiotic relationship between the two remains open to interpretation, though his legendary indifference to customer complaints certainly supports the popular version.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Chrysler built 55 stunning turbine-powered cars and loaned them to regular families across America for real-world testing. These weren't just concepts, they were fully functional vehicles with bronze metallic paint, rotating turbine-inspired taillights, and jet engines that could run on almost anything from diesel to perfume.\n\nThe program ran from 1963 to 1966, and the cars performed surprisingly well, but Chrysler ultimately decided not to pursue production. Here's where it gets weird: of the 55 cars built, Chrysler destroyed 46 of them, mainly to avoid long-term liability and support problems with such a unique fleet in private hands (the often-repeated ‘import duties on the Italian bodies’ explanation is only part of the story), leaving just nine survivors.\n\nThose nine survivors are scattered among museums, with a few in private collections, representing one of the boldest experiments that almost changed automotive history but didn't.\n\nMazda's unwavering commitment to the rotary engine, even when it nearly bankrupted the company multiple times, remains one of automotive history's most puzzling strategic decisions. The Wankel rotary engine offered a smoother, more compact alternative to piston engines, and Mazda licensed the technology in the 1960s with genuine enthusiasm.\n\nDespite chronic issues with fuel economy, oil consumption, and emissions regulations, Mazda kept developing rotaries for decades, culminating in the legendary RX-7 and RX-8. The company invested massive resources into an engine design that most manufacturers had already abandoned as impractical.\n\nWhile enthusiasts celebrate Mazda's dedication to uniqueness and the rotary's undeniable character, it's still unclear whether this was visionary persistence or stubborn defiance of market reality.\n\nJohn DeLorean's stainless steel sports car dream became reality with substantial backing from the British government, which invested over $120 million in a factory in Northern Ireland. The deal seemed too good to be true for an unproven car company, and it was: the project collapsed amid allegations of drug trafficking in a controversial FBI sting operation.\n\nDeLorean was eventually acquitted on grounds of entrapment, but by then, the company was finished after producing only about 9,000 cars. Questions remain about the financial arrangements, government motivations, and whether the whole venture was viable from the start.\n\nThe DeLorean story has everything: innovation, government intrigue, legal drama, and ultimately, immortality through Back to the Future.\n\nMost people credit Pontiac's 1964 GTO as the first muscle car, creating the formula of stuffing a big engine into a midsize body. But Studebaker enthusiasts will quickly point out that the 1963 Avanti R3 and the 1963-64 Lark Daytona with the R2 supercharged engine came first, offering serious performance in relatively affordable packages.\n\nStudebaker was installing high-performance V8s in compact bodies before Pontiac made it famous. The debate comes down to definitions: was it about the specific formula, the marketing approach, or the cultural impact? Studebaker certainly had the hardware first, but Pontiac created the phenomenon.\n\nWhether this makes Studebaker the forgotten originator or simply an earlier experiment depends on how you define the category itself.\n\nIt's estimated that hundreds of thousands of cars were built between 1900 and 1915, yet remarkably few survive today compared to later eras. These early automobiles, often called \"brass-era\" cars for their prominent brass fixtures, have survival rates that seem impossibly low given the sheer numbers produced.\n\nMany were simply worn out and scrapped, but that doesn't fully explain where they all went. The materials were valuable during wartime scrap drives, they were considered worthless old junk long before anyone thought to preserve them, and many likely decayed in barns and fields before anyone recognized their historical value.\n\nThe few survivors command enormous prices today, making you wonder how many treasures are still hiding in forgotten corners waiting to be discovered.\n\nThe 427 Shelby Cobra has legendary performance figures that seem to vary depending on who's telling the story and which magazine you're reading. While we know the top speed, published 0-60 times range from 3.5 to 4.5 seconds, and quarter-mile times are similarly inconsistent.\n\nThe problem is that these weren't factory cars with standardized specifications; they were essentially hand-built race cars with street registration, each potentially different. Testing conditions varied wildly, some cars had race modifications, and Carroll Shelby himself was known for optimistic claims. Modern recreations and continuation cars add to the confusion by posting different numbers with modern tires and tuning.\n\nFor a car that's supposed to represent pure, raw American performance, we still can't quite pin down exactly how raw it really was.\n\nThe Pontiac Fiero suffered from one of the strangest reputation spirals in automotive history, earning a “fire hazard” label that stuck far harder than the underlying facts.\n\nEarly 1984 Fieros did experience a higher-than-normal rate of engine fires, largely due to a connecting-rod failure in the 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine. But contrary to the common retelling, GM didn’t solve the problem overnight—the company didn’t issue a full recall until late 1987, after several years of incidents and negative publicity. By that time, the damage to the Fiero’s image was irreversible. Ironically, once the mechanical issues were addressed, later Fieros had fire incident rates much closer to other cars of the era.\n\nAnd when Pontiac finally perfected the formula with the vastly improved 1988 suspension and upgraded powertrains, the car was already living under a cloud it couldn’t escape. The Fiero remains a case study in how early flaws—and delayed corporate responses—can overshadow genuine engineering progress.\n\nThese automotive mysteries remind us that history isn't always as clear-cut as we'd like it to be. Some puzzles stem from lost documentation, others from deliberate secrecy, and still others from the simple fact that people remember things differently over time.\n\nWhat makes these stories fascinating isn't necessarily finding definitive answers, but the conversations they spark and the detective work they inspire. The next time you're at a car show or scrolling through auction listings, remember that automotive history is still being written and rewritten.\n\nWho knows what forgotten prototype might be gathering dust in someone's garage, or what long-held belief might be overturned by newly discovered documents tomorrow.",

    "description": "\"I think instead of doing DOGE, I would have basically worked on my companies.\"",
    "fullText": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk is known in part for saying controversial or \"careless\" things, but as the Guardian reported, he recently made a sincerely shocking admission.\n\nOn Dec. 9, Musk appeared on a podcast hosted by Katie Miller, the wife of deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller. During that appearance, the Tesla CEO made a highly unusual set of statements, describing the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which was previously run by him, as only \"a little bit successful.\" Miller asked Musk if he would do it all again, and he said he wouldn't.\n\n\"I think instead of doing DOGE, I would have basically worked on my companies. And they wouldn't have been burning the cars,\" Musk said, referencing Tesla vandalism.\n\nIn 2025, Musk's involvement in American politics moved beyond funding and into an active government role.\n\nMusk first floated the idea of a \"government efficiency\" division in August 2024, and on Jan. 20, the concept formally became the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\n\nWhat followed was, by all accounts, an immediate frenzy of government cuts. Staffed by individuals as young as 19, none older than 25, DOGE was likened to a \"wrecking ball.\"\n\nWithin a week, more than two million federal civil servants received an email pressuring them to resign from their positions and transition \"to higher productivity jobs in the private sector.\"\n\nMusk repeatedly pledged to cut $1 trillion worth of what he insisted was \"waste, fraud, and abuse\" in Washington, despite scant evidence of the purported problem. One of DOGE's first high-profile actions was to decommission USAID, a humanitarian aid agency.\n\nDOGE \"spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper. Could gone to some great parties. Did that instead,\" Musk posted to X on Feb. 3.\n\nBacklash was swift as food aid was incinerated rather than distributed, and in the spring, Microsoft founder Bill Gates characterized DOGE's targeting of USAID as \"the world's richest man killing the world's poorest children.\"\n\nWould you buy an EV if it only took you five minutes to charge?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nVital funds appropriated by Congress were frozen, in-progress projects were canceled, and DOGE's activity at the Social Security Administration affected disbursements and potentially compromised Americans' data.\n\nAs scenes of chaos unfolded, Musk emphasized his public-facing role, even as critical agencies like the National Weather Service had their funding slashed. Backlash was swift and not limited to the United States.\n\nMusk's role as CEO of Tesla was equally prominent, and the electric vehicle manufacturer's dealerships were protested, with cars and charging stations vandalized.\n\nSales slumped immediately in the U.S. and Europe, and a subsequent NBER study quantified the enormous economic impact Musk's actions inflicted on the Tesla brand.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "I get really carsick if I try to read in a moving vehicle. And there's a reason for that: my eyes and my sense of movement are out of sync.\n\nAt least, that's according to the CDC, which states that motion sickness, \"happens when the movement you see is different from what your inner ear senses.\" Your inner ear is a sack of fluid that moves when you do, giving you an innate sense of movement. If you're in a car and watching the horizon, your senses are aligned. But if you're looking at your phone, your senses are confusing each other. It's similar to the reason VR games make some people feel sick.\n\nThe free Android app KineStop aims to help. The application overlays a transparent horizon, and a number of transparent dots, across your entire screen. The accelerometer on your phone is used to move these reference points as your phone moves, helping to reduce the conflict between your eyes and your inner ear. You can turn the feature on manually in the application or, if you prefer, you can set it up to turn on automatically when you're in a moving car.\n\nI tried it out, wondering if it would help with my carsickness, and it did—surprisingly well. Normally I can't read for more than a few minutes without feeling sick, but the KineStop app helped me do so for longer, without discomfort. I'm still not going to be able to read novels during a long road trip, mind you, but I can look up the next restaurant on a road trip without vomiting, and I call that a win.\n\nKineStop is totally free, though there's a $3.50 pro version that adds themed overlays, including one that makes it look like your phone is a half-empty beer. It's great to support a developer, but I also think the free version will work fine for most everyone.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 11 - Major automakers on Thursday urged Washington to prevent Chinese government-backed automakers and battery manufacturers from opening U.S. ​manufacturing plants, warning the industry's future is at stake.\n\nThe Alliance for Automotive ‌Innovation, which represents General Motors, Ford, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen, Hyundai, Stellantis and other major automakers, sounded the ‌alarm and said Congress and the Trump administration needed to act.\n\n\"China poses a clear and present threat to the auto industry in the U.S.,\" the group wrote in a statement for a U.S. House hearing on Chinese vehicles. The group also said ⁠lawmakers should maintain the U.S. ‌Commerce Department's prohibition on importing information and communications technology and services from China that effectively bars the import of vehicles from ‍Chinese manufacturers.\n\n\"No amount of investment by automakers and battery manufacturers operating inside the U.S. can counter a China that is enabled by subsidies to chronically oversupply around the world. This is ​a recipe for dumping that Congress and the Trump Administration must prevent ‌from happening inside the U.S.,\" the auto industry group said.\n\nRepresentative John Moolenaar, a Republican who chairs a select House committee on China, said Congress should codify into law the prohibitions on Chinese-connected vehicles that were adopted in the final days of former President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"In just five years, China has gone from a minor ⁠exporter to the world's largest auto exporter, shipping ​6 million vehicles abroad last year at below ​market prices that U.S. and allied automakers cannot match,\" Moolenaar said. \"With massive subsidies, control over raw materials and supply chains and a ‍predatory regulatory regime, Beijing ⁠has turned its auto industry into a tool of the state.\n\nHe also cited national security concerns about Chinese-imported vehicles and concerns that Beijing could ⁠disable vehicles with Chinese-made software or components in the event of a major confrontation.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in ‌Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "title": "Consumer Reports Says This Luxury Vehicle Is One Of The Most Reliable Cars",
    "description": "Buying a car that's reliable will save you from serious headaches later on. According to Consumer Reports, this is one of the most reliable luxury vehicles.",
    "fullText": "The Lexus NX was listed by Consumer Reports as one of the ten most reliable vehicles. According to the CR report, published in December 2024, the 2025-year model got a score of 78 out of a possible 100 in the reliability category, placing it in seventh place. That might sound a tad underwhelming, especially when you consider the fact that the 2024 Lexus NX model received a score of 95 in terms of reliability while the 2021 model received a score of 94. Keep in mind, these are outliers. The 2023 model rated a worrisome 58, down from 2022's Lexus NX which had a reliability score of 66.\n\nThat being said, the Lexus NX has generally achieved solid reliability scores from CR (over 70, apart from '22 and '23) since it first debuted in 2015 which shouldn't be too surprising since its part of the Lexus brand. In 2025, Lexus ranked the highest in terms of vehicle dependability for the third year in a row, according to J.D. Power. Whereas the average vehicle in that survey experienced 202 problems per 100 vehicles over the course of three years, the Lexus vehicles had just 104 problems per 100 vehicles.\n\nBest of all, while the Lexus NX is a luxury SUV it isn't all that expensive compared to other luxury brands. The car sells at an average of $50,896, which is slightly below the average price for a new vehicle of any kind ($50,080) in September 2025. The average price for a luxury compact SUV, as of March 2025, was $52,933.\n\nOn average, the Lexus NX costs $7,712 in maintenance costs for its first 10 years of service. That's $4,741 less than the average luxury SUV model. Also: There is only a 21.14% chance the Lexus NX will need a huge fix within those ten years. That beats other luxury SUVs by 17.37%. Such low car shop rates would appear to be a testimony to the Lexus NX's overall reliability, but again some model years are better than others.\n\nThere were also some recalls implemented by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for issues that included a back over prevention rearview camera that didn't work (model years 2022-2025), a deactivated airbag at the steering column (2023 and 2024), a head restraint on the driver's and passenger's side that could be accidentally removed (2023 and 2024), a defective second-row center seatbelt (2025), and a parking service brake that won't engage while in park (2022). There was also an electrical issue with some Lexus NX450 hybrid electric vehicles that sometimes caused them to overheat while recharging in temperatures below 41 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nRecall issues are supposed to be fixed by dealers free of charge. Assuming you can verify that those issues were taken care of, acquiring a preowned Lexus NX might not be a bad idea if you're trying to decide whether to buy new or used. You can save an average of $17,900 acquiring a reliable Lexus NX that is two years old while maintaining confidence it still has years of use ahead of it.\n\nOn the flip side, a Lexus NX may not be as good a used car investment as the Lexus RX 350 because the Lexus NX loses 47% of its value after five years while a Lexus RX 350 depreciates just 35% in that time. The Lexus NX depreciation rate is also higher than that of the overall Lexus brand, which averages at 38.3% over five years.\n\nIt's no secret that new cars depreciate quickly after you buy them, but among luxury car brands Lexus is the very best when it comes to its ability to retain resale value. A new vehicle usually depreciates 55% over five years, so the Lexus NX's 47% depreciation rate is still above average — unlike the popular Jeep Wagoneer, which has terrible resale value.\n\nUnlock your financial potential.

    "description": "If your car ended up on this list, I think it would be best if you headed down to the comments and explained yourself.",
    "fullText": "We all know cars are quite expensive right now. The average new car will now set you back over $50,000, which isn't ideal for anyone. That means there are plenty of terrible car values out there, and that idea is what led me to the question I asked you all last week.\n\nI wanted to know which car on sale today is the worst value. What car provides so little for the money it costs that you cannot wrap your head around why anyone could possibly buy one? How was a dealer salesman so slimy or good at his job that they were able to convince someone to buy that piece of crap?\n\nI know. It's mind-boggling. But in any case, I'll stop yapping. How about you all drop down below and check out what new cars your fellow Jalops consider to be the worst values out there. If your car ended up on this list, I think it would be best if you headed down to the comments and explained yourself.\n\nA car of many flaws, but the biggest one is the existence of X5 M - same performance, better comfort, better looks, half the price.\n\nIt's a $70K + EV with inferior performance to EVs that cost $20k less. You're just paying a massive premium for nostalgia and getting nothing in terms of range and performance, not to mention it's often said that the interior materials are industrial at best.\n\nCybertruck of course. 6 figure purchase price, gets out performed by vehicles half the cost. Worse, you can't sell it or trade it in without giving it away... nobody wants a used Cybertruck. Buy F150, Ram 1500, Chevy Silverado, and they will do more for much less and have a much better resale value.\n\nPut down the pitchforks and hear me out...\n\nThe base Porsche 911 now starts at $134,650 (including destination) before options for the 992.2 generation (let's just ignore the ADMs and allocation games that dealers are playing). Yes, that gets you legendary sports car with sublime handling and Porsche build quality, but it also only nets you 388 hp and a basic interior that wouldn't look out of place in a mid-trim level Mazda. Start adding options and you can very quickly approach $200k. Porsche has gone bonkers with its pricing the last few years, especially on the 911. It's a great car, but at that price it's just not a great value anymore.\n\nYes I'm still bitter about the price and power level. Really would have liked one for a daily driver. Toyota needs to step up and make a GR Prius.\n\nThe Ineos Grenadier. 80k+ for a Land Rover knock off. If you're going to spend that much, just get a Land Rover Classic. About the same cost, but at least it's a real land rover.\n\nThe current AMG GT 2 door - yes, the car I adore, is...not the worst value per se, but definitely over priced for sure, however the worst value for the money in that model has to be the GT43. Also why they made the GT into a 4 door car with the same name is also stupid, so now I have to specify which variant I want, which is annoying.\n\nBut why on Earth is there a 4 banger version for the 2 door? And why on Europa, does it start at $106K? Are you dumb!? It has the same 0-60 as a stock Evo X MR that costed less than half it's price. It's the same thing that happened with the C63, only thank the lord Mercedes wasn't dumb enough to put that drivetrain in the GT63. But it is absolutely inexcusable to charge $106K for a mild hybrid 4 banger, especially when the CLE 53 exists which looks dam good in it's own right, and comes in a 3 liter inline 6 with mild hybrid for...76 Thousand dollars! The GT43 is still a pretty car, but a pretty car for posers. Mercedes...what are we doing? Consumers that bought that thing...what are you doing?\n\nUnpopular opinion but I would say most new Toyota vehicles are way overpriced for what you get. A new Tacoma can run you up to 50 - 60 grand. That is what a full sized truck used to cost. Think about all that you could buy on the used market for the price. You could buy 2 Ford Maveriks for 30k. Is the Tacoma twice the truck? For what most people use it for no way.\n\ncurrently, the Z. It's just a gussied up 370Z with false rarity and dealer markups that dont make sense because it isnt that desirable.\n\nLamborghini Urus. It's an Audi, so there's that. Hardly anyone outside of your cult will know what it is, so there's that, too. At the end of the day it's a quarter million dollar station wagon for your kids to spill their juice boxes in the back seat.\n\nI was just in Palm Beach and the amount of Cullinan's there was downright baffling - and I had this exact thought of, what does a Cullinan do that is worth $300K more than a fully equipped Range Rover or Bentayga? And the only thing I could come up with is: Status. Those people there thrive on social hierarchy, and I suppose can justify the gargantuan price. To me, though - it's absurd.\n\nIf I had that level of money, I'd still be driving my old 4Runner or perhaps a similar era Landcruiser. Why care what the neighbors think unless they're paying my bills? To each their own.\n\nWant more like this?

    "description": "The auto conglomerate, which owns Jeep and Ram, confirmed that it would bring the Fiat Topolino — a 2.5-meter-long electric tiny car — to the US.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has opened the door for tiny cars to be sold in the US — and now Stellantis is bringing an Italian mini car to American shores.\n\nThe auto conglomerate, which owns Jeep and Ram, confirmed on Monday that it would bring the Fiat Topolino — a 2.5-meter-long electric tiny car — to the US.\n\nSpeaking at an event in Michigan, Fiat CEO Olivier Francois said the Topolino's display appearances in the US had sparked \"tremendous excitement,\" adding that the company would share more details about the tiny car's US launch next year.\n\nThe Topolino, which means \"little mouse\" in Italian, is a major departure from the gas-guzzling big trucks that dominate US roads.\n\nBuilt by Italian brand Fiat, the compact city car has a max range of around 47 miles and a top speed of 28 miles per hour.\n\nWeighing less than a golf cart, it's technically classified as an electric quadricycle rather than a car, meaning that it can be driven from age 14 in some European countries.\n\nThe Topolino is available throughout Europe and costs around 9,900 euros ($11,500) in its home market of Italy. Its impending US launch follows a sudden burst of support for tiny cars from an unlikely source — Trump.\n\nThe US president expressed admiration for Japan's pint-sized Kei cars after a recent trip to the country.\n\nTrump described the mini electric models, which are hugely popular in Japan, as \"very cute\" and \"beautiful,\" and said last week that he had loosened regulations to allow manufacturers to build them in the US.\n\nA Stellantis spokesperson told CNBC the announcement of the Topolino's US launch was unrelated to Trump's comments. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nKei cars have developed an enthusiastic cult following in the US, but the vehicles don't meet federal auto standards and can only be imported if they're over 25 years old.\n\nKei cars also face a patchwork of state regulations, with some states limiting them to low speeds or prohibiting them from being driven on public roads entirely.",
