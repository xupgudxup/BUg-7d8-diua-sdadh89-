    "fullText": "A Caracas highway is choked with cars.\n\nBut far from typical rush hour traffic, Avenida Boyacá, a highway running alongside El Avila National Park in Venezuela’s capital, has ground to a halt because masked men holding Kalashnikovs are stopping drivers and demanding to search their phones and cars.\n\nThe gangs of armed men, part of pro-Maduro militias known as Colectivos, scoured vehicles at hastily erected checkpoints following a government directive to root out Venezuelans in support of the US’s brazen capture of Nicolás Maduro.\n\nDays after the sudden decapitation of the Maduro regime, Venezuelans have been left fearing what could come next as mobs of men dressed in civilian clothes with assault rifles slung over their shoulders roam the streets.\n\n“The future is uncertain, the Colectivos have weapons, the Colombian guerrilla is already here in Venezuela, so we don’t know what’s going to happen, time will tell,” Oswaldo, a 69-year-old Venezuelan shop owner, told The Telegraph.\n\nA state of emergency decree published on Monday has sought to crack down on any public celebration of the US operation. It ordered police to “immediately begin the national search and capture of everyone involved in the promotion or support for the armed attack by the United States”.\n\nOne Venezuelan, who wished to remain anonymous, said she would no longer leave the house with her phone over fears it could be scoured for anti-Maduro texts or photographs, which could lead to her imprisonment.\n\nThe paramilitaries have already arrested 14 journalists and media workers – 11 from foreign news outlets – for hours before releasing some of them. The whereabouts of other journalists are unknown.\n\nThe presence of Colectivos, armed men who ride around on motorcycles and are used as an unofficial government arm of repression, suggests that Maduro loyalists are desperately attempting to maintain their grip on the country.\n\nVideos circulating on social media shows armed men declaring they would not allow Donald Trump and US “pigs” to come in and plunder the country’s natural resources.\n\nAnother video shows interior minister Diosdado Cabello, Mr Maduro’s closest ally, posing with a crowd of the armed militia as they shouted: “Always loyal, never traitors.”\n\nMr Cabello, who has a $50m bounty on his head for drug trafficking charges, largely controls the Colectivos.\n\nAs Mr Maduro pleaded his innocence and claimed he was a “prisoner of war” during his arraignment at Manhattan Federal Court, armed supporters said his heart and soul remained in Venezuela.\n\n“There’s enough people here, there’s enough balls here to fight for this revolution, to fight for this motherland,” said a man who identified himself as Freddy Rodriguez, a member of Cupaz, a network set up by Maduro in 2019 to control protests.\n\nOn Monday morning, most shops and businesses had reopened in Caracas and the long queues of panicked Venezuelans trying to buy provisions had dissipated.\n\nPolice and intelligence officers lined the streets in the centre of Caracas, with two main avenues closed as Delcy Rodriguez, Mr Maduro’s vice president, was sworn in by her brother, National Assembly leader Jorge Rodrigue.\n\n“I come with sorrow for the suffering inflicted upon the Venezuelan people following an illegitimate military aggression against our homeland,” she said while holding up her right hand.\n\n“I come with sorrow for the kidnapping of two heroes.”\n\nHer comments struck a different tone than on Sunday when she said she had “invited the US government to work together on an agenda of co-operation” in the wake of Mr Trump’s warning that she would pay a “very big price” should she not do as instructed.\n\nIn Caracas, Venezuelans who had initially welcomed Maduro’s capture, hoping it would lead to real change in the country, were left feeling deflated by Ms Rodriguez’s ascension and the continuation of Mr Maduro’s regime.\n\nThe country’s constitution requires an election within 30 days whenever the president becomes “permanently unavailable” to serve. However, the Supreme Court declared Mr Maduro’s absence a “temporary” one.\n\nIn such a scenario, the vice president takes over for up to 90 days – a period that can be extended to six months with a vote of the National Assembly.\n\nMaría Corina Machado, the Venezuelan Opposition leader and recent winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, said the crackdown by the militia was “really alarming” and that the country’s transition to democracy needed to happen.\n\n“Delcy Rodriguez, as you know, is one of the main architects of torture, persecution, corruption, narco-trafficking,” Ms Machado told Fox News. “She’s a main ally and liaison of ‍Russia, China, Iran, certainly not an individual who could be trusted by international investors and she’s really rejected by the Venezuelan people.”\n\nThere has been no discussion of holding democratic elections and the future of the country still hangs in the balance.\n\n“I wanted a change in government because these people have done a lot of damage to the country; they forgot they were public servants, they thought they owned the country,” shopkeeper Oswaldo said.\n\n“But now we’re at the same point, he has left and another has replaced him – Delcy Rodriguez, Diosdado Cabello and Vladimir Padrino López – they’re all still here.”\n\nSpeaking to The Telegraph in Plaza Altamira while she waited for a job interview, Aurora said she had hoped for a regime change but said her main concern was putting food on the table.\n\n“Most international leaders don’t agree with what happened, but it happened.\n\n“We saw it coming, everybody saw it coming, but nobody imagined it would happen like this, so violent. Some wished for it and others not, but there is not one country in the world that can interfere in the government and say the oil is mine, no, this is a lie, this belongs to the Venezuelan people.”\n\nWhile she pushed back at Mr Trump’s suggestion he would “run” Venezuela, Aurora, a care worker from Petare, said: “We needed a change and it was necessary and now we need a transition.”\n\n“Every birth involves pain and now we have to move forward,” she added.\n\nOthers were less accepting of the current situation.\n\n“Honestly, I think this should not have happened; he [Maduro] should be in his country governing his country,” a 59-year-old sports coach, who requested to remain anonymous, said.\n\n“All I wish for Venezuela is for things to be calm, we’ve been through so much already... I know that we weren’t well, but emotionally and physically we were more at peace.”\n\nThe thought of Mr Trump deciding what comes next for Venezuelans, as opposed to holding fair elections, has left many concerned.\n\n“I don’t agree with what Trump said, he said he was coming to run our country – I want a transition, I want elections,” Oswaldo said.\n\n“If the majority of people are in favour of Delcy, fine, if it is a transparent election and we will recognise the results peacefully – if the Chavismo wins, then ok, but if the opposition wins, they will have to recognise their defeat.”\n\nJournalists in Caracas contributed to this report but asked to withhold their names for fear of reprisals from the regime\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "Business Insider is on the ground at Las Vegas CES 2026. Here's everything we learned on self-driving cars and robotaxis,",
    "fullText": "Business Insider is taking on CES 2026.\n\nI'm on the ground in Las Vegas from Tuesday to Thursday, taking in all there is to know about the latest in the driverless space.\n\nRobotaxis and self-driving cars have already had an outsize presence at the tech conference, especially in the previous hype cycle of the late 2010s and early 2020s.\n\nThings have changed since then. The industry has largely moved on from mere concepts and technology validation to: How are we going to realistically scale autonomy?\n\nIt's day one of the conference, and there's already a lot to take in.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang unveiled the Alpamayo family, which will serve as an autonomous-driving stack for OEMs to deal with those stubborn edge cases — or the \"long tail\" of self-driving.\n\nUber and Nuro showed off an early look at the Lucid Gravity SUV that the companies hope public riders will be able to take by late 2026.\n\nI'll be spending less time at keynotes and speaker events and more on real-life demonstrations and meetings with industry leaders and commentators in autonomy\n\nThink of this as my personal notebook, where I jot down everything I've learned and seen at the conference.\n\nCheck back in for more updates.\n\nThis is the first year Zoox, an Amazon-backed robotaxi company, will be giving live demonstrations of its service during CES.\n\nI got to take a ride in one on Monday night in front of Resorts World. (The company tagline that I saw from an ad at the Harry Reid International Airport was: \"Don't just do the Strip. Zoox it.\")\n\nMy immediate thoughts were that Zoox feels unlike any other robotaxi or pseudo-robotaxi on the market. It felt more like I was on a theme park ride than in an everyday car we're familiar with.\n\nUnlike Waymo's robotaxis, Zoox is not a regular car you could buy that's been retrofitted with sensors. The Zoox car is bi-directional — meaning there's no real front or back of the car — and the inside has no steering wheel, just seats.\n\nThe robotaxis were clearly a great tourist attraction from what I saw. My Uber driver wasn't too happy about them.\n\nUber, Lucid, and Nuro had a swanky cocktail hour at Fontainebleau Las Vegas, where they quite literally wined and dined a room full of reporters, analysts, and investors: endless glasses of wine and an open bar, lobster tails, jumbo shrimp, too many appetizers to count, and a giant charcuterie board — the works.\n\nMaybe understandably so? 2026 will be a big year for the three companies.\n\nUber's plan is to roll out a robotaxi service by late 2026. The first market is San Francisco, where Uber will directly compete with Waymo. These two companies are partners in other markets, like Austin.\n\n\"We've been moving very, very quickly,\" Nuro's co-CEO and cofounder Dave Ferguson said. \"We signed this partnership last July. We're already testing the production-intent vehicles on public roads. And very soon, we're going to have tens of thousands of them worldwide.\"",

    "fullText": "Officials in the Philippines recently confiscated a handful of cars that had been modified into racing cars, sharing details of the crackdown on Facebook and sparking conversation about the dangers of illegal modifications and street racing.\n\nThe Land Transportation Office in the Calabarzon region seized six Honda Civics that had been illegally modified and were allegedly being used for street racing in Batangas City.\n\nNews of the crackdown quickly spread, with the altered cars missing safety components, having \"improvised plates,\" and racing-style alterations that made them unsafe for public roads.\n\nAccording to authorities, the vehicles violated multiple traffic laws, including operating without registration, using defective or illegal accessories, and failing to meet basic safety requirements such as proper headlights, mufflers, bumpers, and mirrors.\n\n\"The illegal modification being done to these vehicles, especially if they are used for illegal racing, is not only a violation of the law but a serious danger to the lives of everyone on the road,\" LTO Chief Assistant Secretary Markus Lacanilao said in a statement, as reported by the Daily Tribune.\n\nModified cars with exposed parts, loud exhaust systems, and missing safety features have become a common sight in some areas — often celebrated online but simultaneously feared by pedestrians and everyday drivers.\n\nBeyond safety risks, illegal street racing increases noise pollution, contributes to road damage, and puts unnecessary strain on emergency services — all while endangering people who never consented to take part. On top of that, while some modifications can be beneficial — even eco-friendly — many modified vehicles burn more fuel, creating more pollution and contributing to poorer air quality and human health issues.\n\n\"We will not stop implementing strict laws — all vehicles used in such illegal activities, traffic violations, regardless of type or class, will be apprehended without bias,\" Lacanilao added. \"Road safety is the LTO's primary priority, and we are ready to take steps to prevent avoidable incidents.\"\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Jensen Huang also announces at CES new, more powerful Vera Rubin chips that will arrive later this year\n\nThe billionaire boss of the chipmaker Nvidia, Jensen Huang, has unveiled new AI technology that he says will help self-driving cars think like humans to navigate more complex situations.\n\nThe world’s most valuable company is to roll out the new technology, Alpamayo, which is designed to help self-driving cars handle tricky situations such as sudden roadworks or unusual driver behaviour on the road, rather than just reacting to previous patterns.\n\nNvidia claims Alpamayo will bring chain-of-thought reasoning to self-driving vehicles, combining what the car sees with language-like reasoning.\n\nIn a speech at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the Nvidia founder and chief executive said: “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here, when machines begin to understand, reason and act in the real world. Robotaxis are among the first to benefit.\n\n“Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments and explain their driving decision. It’s the foundation for safe, scalable autonomy.”\n\nNvidia has started producing a driverless car powered by its technology, the Mercedes-Benz CLA, in partnership with the German carmaker. It will be launched in the US in the coming months, followed by Europe and Asia. Huang showed a video of the car driving through San Francisco with a passenger sitting behind the steering wheel, their hands in their lap.\n\n“It drives so naturally because it learned directly from human demonstrators,” Huang said, “but in every single scenario … it tells you what it’s going to do, and it reasons about what it’s about to do.”\n\nHuang also said the company’s next generation of chips was in full production, and they could deliver five times the computing power of the company’s previous products when serving up chatbots and other AI apps.\n\nHe revealed new details about the chips, which will arrive later this year as Nvidia faces increasing competition from rivals as well as its own customers.\n\nThe Vera Rubin platform, made up of six separate Nvidia chips, is expected to debut later this year. The flagship server will contain 72 of the company’s graphics units and 36 of its new central processors.\n\nHuang showed how they could be strung together into “pods” with more than 1,000 Rubin chips and said they could improve the efficiency of generating what are known as “tokens” – the fundamental unit of AI systems – by 10 times.\n\nTo get the new performance results, Huang said the Rubin chips used a proprietary kind of data that the company hopes the wider industry will adopt.\n\nWhile Nvidia still dominates the market for training AI models, it faces far more competition – from traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices as well as customers such as Alphabet’s Google – in delivering the fruits of those products to hundreds of millions of users of chatbots and other technologies.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Sony's Keynote This Year Was All About Electric Cars",
    "description": "The Sony Honda Mobility Afeela 1 is finally coming out.",
    "fullText": "At last year's CES, Sony's press conference showed off products from all over its portfolio, including a first look at The Last of Us season 2. This year, it was all about the Afeela, an electric car Sony's making in collaboration with Honda that it's been teasing for years, but is now finally getting ready to release.\n\nSony has big plans for Afeela. Previews have been less about hard specs like mileage or speed and more about the company's plans to change how we look at cars. Previously, that's included demo'ing integrations with other Sony services like Crunchyroll and themes for the car's interior based on Sony brands. Just last month, the company confirmed it would support PlayStation Remote Play in the Afeela, after teasing it at CES 2024. And the first time I saw the Afeela at CES, it was driven onto stage using a PS5 controller.\n\nNow, Sony's ready to talk more than aesthetics and cute integrations, but that unique voice didn't go anywhere. Headlining the show was the promise that the company's currently working on something called Afeela Intelligent Drive. Currently, it's sitting at level 2+ driver assistance, which means it can handle tasks like merging or lane changes, but Sony's planning to take it to level 4+ \"in the future,\" meaning full self-driving within certain areas. It probably won't be ready for launch, but it does show the company's getting serious about usability.\n\nOn that note, it also showed concepts for a future where Afeela users will basically just chill while the car drives itself. Those kind of promises aren't rare at CES, but Sony specifically called out its brand of entertainment products as what riders would occupy themselves with on their rides. Combined with the Intelligent Drive news, apparently that's what all those ecosystem cross-promotions were leading towards.\n\nBut until that future arrives, Sony still isn't afraid to use Afeela to push its products, although it isn't stopping there. The company brought PlayStation on stage to quickly reaffirm Remote Play will be baked into the Afeela (while also dropping the surprising stat that apparently half of all PlayStation Remote Play sessions now happen on the PlayStation Portal streaming handheld). It also said that the Afeela will have themes for its touchscreens based on Sony properties like Astro Bot and Gran Turismo. None of that is too far off from what the company's shown before, but the idea of turning your car into a media ecosystem doesn't stop there. Sony also announced the Afeela co-creation program, which will let developers and content creators make their own custom apps or media for the car.\n\nThese include things like themes and even special Android apps, but apparently, drivers can even customize the Afeela's \"motor\" sound, and put visuals on a small \"media bar\" on the front of the car. As an example, Sony brought out Japanese music producer Tomoko Ida, who demonstrated a motor sound she created that sounded more like a THX commercial than anything else.\n\nIt's honestly a pretty clever move for a car that's been all about the ecosystem as opposed to the hard specs so far. But it does have one oddity that maybe speaks to how long this thing's been teased. Apparently, developers for the Co-Creation program will be able to get paid in crypto, which Sony says will \"accelerate open co-creation,\" although it also says the Co-Creation program will be \"open to other automakers and service providers.\" I'm not sure Toyota will want to get paid on the blockchain, but whatever.\n\nDrivers will be able to access utilities and apps made for their Afeela using an app, but that raises the question: When will you finally be able to drive this thing?\n\nThe Afeela has been teased since CES 2023, but finally Sony says the car is in production and will begin delivering to customers in California sometime this year. In fact, all the photos you've seen of the Afeela throughout this article have been of an actual pre-production model for the initial Afeela car, now called Afeela 1.\n\nThat's huge for Afeela, but there is a catch. Those deliveries might take a while to reach the rest of the country. Sony says Arizona is next on its radar, but that sales won't make it there until 2027. Japanese deliveries are also slated for 2027, but living in New York, I'll just have to keep pretending this thing doesn't exist.\n\nThat's a bit of a blow for a car that started off this press conference promising a new future for how we drive, since even once it gets on the streets, it'll probably take even longer for that to come true. Still, Sony says it will allow people who have already registered to buy a car to start doing test drives of the car sometime before deliveries begin.\n\nI'll be honest, I don't cover cars much, and that this year's Sony press conference was all about one maybe points to a quiet year across the rest of the brand. That said, for people who are into driving, I can see the Afeela's appeal. It definitely feels more like a gadget than a gas guzzler, and I'm wondering if this is what the Apple Car might have looked like if it ever came out.\n\nProbably not—despite the fancy mock-ups, I did sit inside an Afeela last year, and it was fancy but still familiar. But that's also not where Afeela is stopping. Sony ended its keynote by driving the \"Afeela Prototype 2026\" onto the stage. It didn't look that different from the outside, but the company says it will offer \"greater spatial flexibility and accessibility.\" To me, that implies a step closer towards that future where the car is essentially a hangout zone that moves you while you play PlayStation, but only time will tell. I'll see you when I actually get behind the wheel of one of these things, probably sometimes in 2040.",

    "fullText": "With Cadillac joining the grid for the 2026 Formula 1 season, there will be 22 cars on the grid, two more than we're currently used to. Because of this, qualifying will see a small change to include the extra two cars. This is what you need to know.\n\nF1's 2026 qualifying format will still have the familiar three-part knockout structure that we're all accustomed to. With a larger grid this year, slight changes have been made to ensure the fight for pole in Q3 still includes just 10 cars.\n\nUnder the FIA's 2026 sporting regulations, qualifying is still split into Q1, Q2 and Q3, with the same timed run plan.\n\nQ1 lasts 18 minutes, followed by a seven-minute break. Q2 will run for 15 minutes with another seven-minute break, and Q3 will last 12 minutes with an eight-minute break. What's different is the cut line.\n\nThe regulations explain that the “procedure detailed in this Article is based upon twenty (20) Cars being officially eligible”, but then add the scaling clause: “If twenty-two (22) Cars are eligible six (6) will be eliminated after Q1 and Q2.”\n\nSo with 22 cars, this is what the format will look like:\n\nP17–P22 (based on fastest Q1 times among eliminated)\n\nP11–P16 (based on fastest Q2 times among eliminated)\n\nP1–P10 (based on fastest Q3 times)\n\nThe sporting regulations confirm that lap times achieved by the remaining cars will then be deleted at the end of Q1, and this same rule applies to Q2 when the field is reduced once again. Just like 2025, there is no banking a better time in a previous section.\n\nSprint qualifying sees the same changes, albeit with shorter sessions.\n\nP17–P22 (based on fastest SQ1 times among eliminated)\n\nP11–P16 (based on fastest SQ2 times among eliminated)\n\nP1–P10 (based on fastest SQ3 times)\n\nWith 22 cars on the grid, we're not seeing a reinvented qualifying. While six drivers will be eliminated in Q1 and Q2, the format still funnels the top 10 cars into Q3 for a normal fight for pole.\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "London predicted to be the first UK city to go diesel-free, largely because of the ultra-low emission zone\n\nBattery electric cars are poised to overtake diesels on Great Britain’s roads by 2030, according to analysis that suggests London will be the first UK city to go diesel-free.\n\nThe number of diesel cars on Great Britain’s roads in June had fallen to 9.9m in June last year, 21% below its peak of 12.4m vehicles, according to analysis by New AutoMotive, a thinktank focused on the transition to electric cars. Electric car sales are still growing rapidly, albeit more slowly than manufacturers had expected.\n\nHowever, the transition to cleaner vans is lagging behind cars, and the number of diesel vans has continued to rise, to a record 4.4m.\n\nThe UK went through a “dash for diesel” cars in the 2000s as the government granted them cheaper tax rates. Diesel engines tend to be more efficient than petrol engines, burning less fuel and producing less carbon dioxide.\n\nHowever, they also produce more nitrous oxides, which are harmful to health. In 2015 Volkswagen was found to have created software to cheat on emissions tests, kicking off the “Dieselgate” scandal, costing it alone €30bn (£26bn) around the world in fines, compensation and legal costs. Analysis this year suggested the extra emissions from cheat devices from Volkswagen and other carmakers were responsible for thousands of deaths and cases of asthma.\n\nSales of cars with diesel engines duly plummeted, to fewer than 100,000 in the first 11 months of 2025. However, it will take some time for the share of diesel cars on the road to diminish, as many cars bought during the peak years of diesels are only now being scrapped.\n\nBattery electric cars made up only 4% of the cars on UK roads last year, compared with 32% diesels and 58% that use petrol, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), a lobby group. The other 6% were hybrids, which mostly combine a smaller battery with a petrol engine.\n\nNevertheless, the number of diesels should drop as older cars are scrapped, delivering benefits for towns and cities where particulates tend to be concentrated. That will also have a knock-on effect for filling stations, leading to many withdrawing diesel supplies.\n\nLondon is expected to be the first place in the UK where no diesel cars or vans are registered, largely because of the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), which applies charges for more polluting non-compliant cars. Diesel numbers are also dropping rapidly in the central belt of Scotland, which contains Edinburgh and Glasgow, both of which have low-emission zones.\n\n“Ending the use of diesel is essential to clean up Britain’s choking cities,” said Ben Nelmes, the chief executive of New AutoMotive. “The UK is now rolling out electric cars at a rapid pace, and this is great news for everyone that enjoys clean air, quieter streets and really cheap running costs.\n\n“The UK imports billions of pounds of diesel every year, and we have been completely reliant on other countries to feed our thirst. Thankfully, we’re switching to electric cars at a rapid rate, and that will make the country cleaner and wealthier.”\n\nHowever, the analysis found that people in cities appeared to be selling their diesels to people in more rural areas.\n\nThe report found that, while the number of diesel vans has risen over the past decade, the peak of new diesel van sales probably happened before the pandemic, meaning the numbers on roads will eventually fall.\n\nMatt Finch, an environmental policy expert who co-wrote the report, said the world was “leaving the diesel age”. He said: “No one is denying diesel hasn’t been useful, but it has had its day.”",

    "fullText": "CORTE MADERA, Calif. (AP) — Heavy rain and high tides believed to be the most severe in two decades caused flooding in parts of Northern California on Saturday, prompting road closures and rescues of people trapped in cars.\n\nRoadways through a 15-mile (24-kilometer) stretch from the Sausalito area to San Rafael were flooded after a downpour coincided with record-breaking “ King Tides,” Marin County Sheriff's Sgt.

Some people kayaked along swamped streets, while others waded through water above their knees.\n\nA flood warning was in place for the San Francisco area until 2 p.m. Saturday and an advisory until 2 p.m. Sunday, according to the National Weather Service, and repeated rounds of rain were expected throughout the state on Sunday and Monday.\n\nTo the south in Santa Barbara County, roads were closed due to flooding and a key highway was blocked near Goleta due to a series of mudslides. A man died after he was swept into a creek during the storm, the county sheriff’s office said.\n\nKing Tides occur when the sun, moon and Earth are in alignment and the moon is in its closest position to the Earth, creating a stronger gravitational pull.",

    "fullText": "When self-driving cars make headlines, it’s usually because something went wrong — a glitch, a failure, an accident.\n\nOn a dark, isolated stretch of Highway 54 in New Mexico, Clifford Lee believes he’s alive today not because of his own reflexes — but because his Tesla Cybertruck, operating in Full Self-Driving mode, made a split-second decision for him.\n\n“I almost got killed,” Lee said. “I was shaking uncontrollably for a while.”\n\nLee was traveling northbound on a two-lane highway, cruising at about 75 miles per hour, using Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system — known as FSD — during a long road trip.\n\nAhead of him, a semi-truck approached in the opposite lane. Behind it, a pickup truck attempted a dangerous pass.\n\n“All I saw were headlights,” Lee said.\n\nWith only seconds to react, Lee realized the pickup wasn’t going to make it back into its lane in time.\n\n“I think it was like five seconds out,” he said. “Around three seconds, I realized he would not make it.”\n\nLee says he tried to steer away — but the Cybertruck was already moving.\n\nThe Cybertruck recorded the entire event. In the video you can clearly see there was no room for error. An overcorrection would’ve bounced Lee’s Cybertruck off the guardrail and possibly back into oncoming traffic.\n\nSlowed down frame by frame, the video shows the Cybertruck making a precise maneuver — avoiding what could have been a deadly head-on collision.\n\n“I’m so convinced it was FSD,” Lee said.\n\nThe only damage: a shattered side window and a broken mirror.\n\nTesla’s Full Self-Driving system relies entirely on cameras — mounted in door pillars, fenders, and around the vehicle — to interpret the world in real time.\n\n“I use it every day,” said Cybertruck owner Aaron George. “I feel so much safer with FSD.”\n\nGeorge demonstrated the system for CBS Austin, starting at the station’s parking lot and setting a destination to Mount Bonnell — a route filled with tricky merges, construction zones, narrow neighborhood streets, and blind intersections.\n\nAt one busy frontage road, the Cybertruck waited for the safest window of opportunity before merging smoothly into traffic.\n\nAt stoplights, the screen displayed every surrounding vehicle — cars, trucks, vans — even those behind the truck.\n\nAs the drive continued, the system navigated tight residential roads, avoided trash cans in the street, detected pedestrians, and cautiously inched forward at blind intersections before turning.\n\n“It’s pretty blinded over there,” George noted at one intersection. “It inched up, saw there were no cars, and made the turn.”\n\nWhen we arrived at Mount Bonnell, the Cybertruck located an open parking spot and backed in— without George ever touching the wheel.\n\n“It’s amazing,” he said. “Every iteration is mind-blowing.”\n\nTesla is currently rolling out Full Self-Driving (Supervised) version 14.\n\nFor many drivers, Full Self-Driving is about convenience. For Clifford Lee, it’s something far more personal.\n\n“I realized this is my second life already,” he said.\n\nLee believes a full-speed impact — closing at a combined speed of nearly 150 miles per hour — would have been unsurvivable.\n\n“There’s no chance I would have survived that,” he said.\n\nTesla’s Full Self-Driving system still requires driver supervision, and federal regulators continue to scrutinize the technology. But for one driver on a lonely highway in New Mexico, a decision made in a fraction of a second may have made all the difference.",

    "description": "Hybrids promise fuel savings and eco-friendliness, but the full story is more complicated. From costly battery replacements to limited highway efficiency, these vehicles come with trade-offs that many buyers overlook. Their environmental impact starts with resource-heavy battery production and ends with complex recycling challenges. This article breaks down the hidden costs and realities behind the hybrid hype.",
    "fullText": "The narrative around electric vehicles has hit a few speed bumps lately. Despite years of relentless marketing and massive production ramps, the EV takeover hasn't quite materialized as some predicted. Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz have both extended the life of combustion and hybrid lineups as EV demand has grown more uneven than expected. Volkswagen has said it may keep ICE models longer and even add new ICE offerings without increasing overall investment, by offsetting spending within its existing plan. Mercedes-Benz has also said it will keep upgrading combustion models and has reported higher-than-previously-planned spending on combustion-engine technology alongside delayed electrification targets.\n\nOn the other hand, hybrids are experiencing a surge in popularity, with manufacturers competing to offer a dizzying array of options. It's easy to see the appeal: they promise that sweet spot of substantial fuel savings without the existential dread of range anxiety. For many drivers, it seems like the ultimate compromise.\n\nBefore you sign on the dotted line for that virtuous hybrid, let's yank back the curtain. Hybrids, for all their supposed eco-cred and practicality, come with their own collection of dirty little secrets.\n\nLike their fully electric counterparts, many hybrids rely on lithium-ion batteries. Extracting the necessary metals, lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and graphite, requires heavy-duty mining operations. Needless to say, these aren't exactly quaint backyard digs. The environmental impact is monumental: think open-pit mining operations that resemble lunar landscapes, carving out vast sections of pristine wilderness.\n\nConsider the thirst: Some commonly cited estimates for brine-based lithium extraction in arid regions put water losses at around ~2–2.2 million liters per tonne of lithium, but water use varies widely by site and extraction method (brine vs hard-rock; definitions of ‘water used’ also differ). In arid regions, this puts immense strain on local water supplies, impacting surrounding communities and fragile ecosystems. Beyond the H2O, the chemicals used during extraction and processing are often toxic, posing a significant risk of contaminating soil and groundwater if not meticulously managed. So, that \"green\" hybrid in your driveway might have a rather large, dirty footprint you never see.\n\nBattery warranty terms vary by brand and market. In the U.S., 8 years is common, and some manufacturers offer longer coverage (for example, Toyota extended hybrid battery coverage to 10 years/150,000 miles for 2020 model-year hybrids). While many last beyond that, there's an undeniable truth: they will eventually degrade to a point where replacement is the only viable option.\n\nAnd here’s where your wallet might go into shock. Even though hybrids pack smaller battery packs than pure EVs, they are far from cheap. Hybrid batteries are usually cheaper than full EV packs, but replacements can still be expensive. Many mainstream hybrid battery replacements are often quoted in the roughly $2,000–$8,000 range depending on the vehicle, battery type, and whether the pack is new or remanufactured. By contrast, full EV battery pack replacements are commonly cited in the $5,000–$16,000+ range because the packs are much larger.\n\nIt’s not like you’ll be swapping these out in your garage with a ratchet set; this is a specialized job, meaning you’ll also be on the hook for significant labor costs and the often-overlooked expense of proper battery disposal. That \"savings at the pump\" might just be a future mortgage payment in disguise.\n\nSure, lithium-ion batteries can be recycled at the end of their life cycle. But \"can be\" and \"is readily done\" are two entirely different things. The process is anything but simple. It requires energy-intensive pyrometallurgy or complex hydrometallurgy, far from a casual drop-off at your local recycling center.\n\nCurrently, the infrastructure for large-scale, cost-effective lithium-ion battery recycling is still in its infancy. Few companies are willing to invest heavily in a process that’s both technically challenging and not yet highly profitable. This means it will be a while before someone cracks the code on how to recycle these power packs on a scale large enough to have a significant, positive environmental impact. If you're having a shop replace your high-voltage hybrid battery, Battery handling and end-of-life pathways vary by region and program; recycling exists but can be costly and logistically complex, which can affect what a shop charges for handling.” (No citation needed; this avoids a hard factual claim you can’t universally prove).\n\nThe hybrid variant of a given car model invariably carries a higher sticker price than its gas-only counterpart. While they are generally more affordable than pure EVs, that upfront premium can put them out of reach for budget-conscious buyers.\n\nMany owners justify this extra expenditure by banking on long-term fuel savings. The harsh reality? It can take several years, or even tens of thousands of miles, to actually break even on that initial investment through fuel savings alone. This is particularly true if you're one of those who replace their car every few years; you might never recoup that premium before the next vehicle purchase.\n\nOpting for a hybrid to \"reduce your carbon footprint\" is a noble intention, but it assumes you'll be running predominantly on battery power. The inconvenient truth is that most hybrids are still fundamentally internal combustion engines with electric assistance. They do burn gasoline, and they do emit CO2 into the atmosphere.\n\nFactor in the energy-intensive battery manufacturing process and the vehicle's entire lifecycle emissions (LCA), and you might find yourself with a vehicle that, by some metrics, has a higher initial carbon footprint than a conventional ICE car. Your \"eco-friendly\" commuter still chugs gas, just perhaps with a touch more virtue-signaling.\n\nSure, some hypercars like the McLaren P1 or Ferrari LaFerrari utilize hybrid technology, but that's for mind-blowing power delivery, not just economy. Your average, everyday hybrid is meticulously engineered to maximize fuel efficiency, typically pairing a modest gas engine with electric motors.\n\nThe added weight of the battery pack and electric motor, coupled with the relentless focus on efficiency, sometimes means hybrids are slower to accelerate than their pure ICE counterparts. That extra mass also compromises handling and agility, making them feel less nimble when you try to toss them into a corner. Your hybrid's \"sport mode\" is often just louder engine noise; don't expect it to win any drag races, unless it's against a kid on a scooter.\n\nWhen everything is humming along nicely, or if your hybrid is still comfortably under warranty, maintenance costs may be comparable to those of an ICE vehicle. However, that's often still more than the bare-bones servicing requirements of a pure EV.\n\nThe real financial hit comes when that warranty expires. Hybrids feature dual powertrains, meaning they combine the complexity of a conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) with high-voltage electric motors, inverters, battery management systems, and specialized cooling systems. If a high-voltage component fails out of warranty, repairs can be astronomically expensive.\n\nFinding an affordable, independent mechanic who possesses the specialized diagnostic tools and training for hybrid systems can also be a significant challenge, often forcing you to return to the pricier dealership service bay. Another hit to your savings that may put that dream car purchase back yet again, good thing you have your hybrid, I guess.\n\nHybrids are undisputed kings in city driving. Their electric motors excel in stop-and-go traffic, enabling electric-only propulsion at low speeds and recovering energy through regenerative braking. This translates to significantly lower fuel consumption than a gas-only car in urban environments.\n\nHowever, once you hit the open highway, that advantage rapidly diminishes. A hybrid's fuel consumption often rises drastically, the opposite of what you see in an ICE vehicle. At cruising speeds, the gas engine is predominantly engaged. Because it's usually a smaller, less powerful unit lugging around extra battery weight, it has to work harder than an equivalent, lighter ICE car. Your hybrid's city MPG bragging rights tend to disappear faster than a cheap date on the interstate.\n\nWe're constantly fed the narrative that hybrids are inherently more environmentally friendly, but as we've dissected, that's not necessarily true, especially if your driving mostly consists of highway miles. Additionally, if your weekly commute is a short trip to the grocery store and back, paying a significant premium for a hybrid might never yield any financial benefits.\n\nFor a hybrid to truly deliver both environmental and economic advantages, you need to cover a substantial amount of miles, predominantly in city driving or stop-and-go traffic, where the electric assist can do its best work. Otherwise, you're just driving a heavier, more complex gas car.\n\nWhen it comes to pulling heavy loads, traditional gasoline and diesel engines are still the undisputed champions. Even some new EVs, such as the Ford F-150 Lightning, Rivian R1T, and Tesla Cybertruck, are proving their mettle in this arena.\n\nHowever, for most mainstream hybrids, towing is an afterthought, if it's even allowed. The smaller internal combustion engines are not designed for sustained heavy loads, and the hybrid systems often lack the necessary cooling capacity or robust driveline components. You're clearly not going to be towing more than a Barbie convertible with something like the Prius.\n\nThe Toyota Sequoia’s maximum tow rating is up to 9,520 lbs when properly equipped (Toyota marketing often highlights up to 9,500 lbs, with exact ratings varying by configuration). The Lexus LX Hybrid is rated up to 8,000 lbs. It's good enough for some campers, but most hybrids are coming nowhere near these numbers. Meanwhile, plenty of gas-fueled SUVs and pickups can breezily tow 10,000-plus pounds, giving you a lot more variety of choices to choose from if towing is your priority. But if the Toyota Sequoia is your dream car, you're in luck.\n\nThat shiny new hybrid typically comes with a steeper insurance bill than its traditional ICE counterpart. This makes perfect sense when you consider the higher purchase price and the increased technological complexity. Insurance companies aren't charities, after all.\n\nBecause hybrid vehicles involve more expensive, specialized components (especially the battery and high-voltage wiring) and require specialized labor for repairs, insurance claims and associated repair costs tend to be higher. Insurance costs vary heavily by model and driver, but some analyses find hybrids average around single-digit percentages higher to insure than comparable gas-only vehicles (one widely cited figure is ~7% higher on average) to insure a hybrid compared to the equivalent gas-only model. That \"eco-friendly\" car also has an \"expensive-to-fix\" price tag for the insurance company.\n\nThe sophisticated lithium-ion batteries found in hybrids (and EVs) are quite particular about their operating environment. They absolutely despise extreme temperatures. When it’s scorching hot, it accelerates battery degradation, leading to a permanent loss of capacity over time. Conversely, when the mercury plummets, the battery's chemical reactions slow down, leading to a noticeable reduction in range, power output, and less efficient regenerative braking. What are they, Goldilocks? Apparently, the temperature has to be juuuust right.\n\nCold temperatures can also significantly impact charging times for plug-in hybrids, forcing the gas engine in standard hybrids to run more frequently and for longer periods to reach optimal operating temperature, thereby directly negating the fuel-saving benefits. Your \"advanced\" battery is pickier about the weather than your aunt Mildred.\n\nToyota famously revolutionized the automotive world with the original Prius hybrid, and the technology has evolved dramatically since then. However, the regulatory landscape is shifting. The EU previously set rules aiming for effectively zero-CO₂ new car sales from 2035, which would have ruled out most hybrids. However, in December 2025 the European Commission proposed changes that would replace an effective 2035 ICE ‘ban’ with a 90% tailpipe CO₂ reduction target, potentially allowing some combustion and hybrid-type vehicles to continue under certain conditions due to their reliance on an internal combustion engine.\n\nMeanwhile, pure EVs are advancing at a breakneck pace, and other alternative technologies like e-fuels (synthetic gasoline) and hydrogen fuel cells are gaining traction. It's entirely plausible that hybrids, despite their current popularity, are merely an interim technology, a bridge to a truly fossil-fuel-free future, destined to be phased out as more efficient and advanced solutions mature. Are hybrids the Betamax of the automotive future or a viable long-term solution despite all their flaws? Only time will tell. In that time, we will be crossing our fingers for your wallet.\n\nLike our content?

    "fullText": "This has to be one of the most charged debates in the U.S. auto industry this year. Scout Motors’ decision to sell cars directly to customers triggered fierce backlash from franchise dealers, highlighting long-simmering tensions between traditional retail networks and emerging direct-to-consumer business models.\n\nThe clash sharpened in Colorado, where the state Motor Vehicle Dealer Board’s decision to grant Scout a dealer license unsettled established dealers, while raising broader questions about the future of auto retailing.\n\nScout Motors is a Volkswagen Group-backed EV brand. The company deliberately pursued a sales approach more commonly associated with Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid.\n\nUnlike conventional manufacturers that rely on independent franchise dealers to sell and service vehicles, Scout intends to manage everything from reservations to delivery through its own facilities and online platform. That model promises transparent pricing, streamlined transactions, and a more controlled experience for customers.\n\nBut dealers see a threat to the industry’s longstanding franchise system, which they argue has underpinned local economies, provided guaranteed service networks, and protected consumers.\n\nOn a recent episode of Inside Automotive, industry veteran Mike Maroone, CEO of Mike Maroone Auto and former AutoNation executive, described Colorado’s regulatory approval as a “circumvention of the traditional franchise system” that undermines dealer investments and protections established over decades.\n\nHe dismissed Scout’s claims of operating separately from its corporate parent, Volkswagen, using a familiar saying to make his point: “If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck.”\n\nMaroone’s critique reflects a fundamental dispute about corporate structure and brand identity. Scout insists that it is a distinct brand with its own business model, but dealers counter that financial backing from Volkswagen and deep operational ties make that distinction superficial. They argue that allowing a manufacturer-backed brand to bypass the dealer network sets a worrying precedent that could unravel protections franchisees rely on.\n\nThe Colorado decision is especially significant because the state boasts one of the strongest electric vehicle markets in the country, with roughly 27 percent of all vehicle sales being electric. Federal and state incentives have helped fuel demand, though shifts in incentive structures have recently moderated growth. Even in a strong market, dealers feel pressured as new direct sales approaches gain regulatory footholds.\n\nMaroone has proposed that dealers consider a multipronged response that could include litigation, negotiation, and political advocacy. He underscored the value of dealer associations in unifying opposition and leveraging political capital to defend the status quo. In his view, the threat is existential rather than theoretical, with manufacturer-owned direct sales potentially eroding the economic foundations of independent dealers.\n\nThe friction goes beyond Colorado. Dealer groups nationwide, including the National Automobile Dealers Association, have pledged to challenge Scout’s direct-to-consumer strategy in courts and statehouses across the country. These challenges echo earlier disputes over Tesla and other electric vehicle makers that have similarly eschewed franchise networks, testing state franchise laws that were drafted long before internet-based sales were possible.\n\nIn some states, dealers have already escalated their opposition into litigation. For example, in Florida, Volkswagen and Audi dealers filed a lawsuit claiming Scout’s direct sales violated state law by accepting deposits for vehicles not yet in production. They contended that taking deposits constituted sales under state definitions and sought injunctions to halt the practice. The dispute underscored how legal interpretations of sales activity vary widely across states.\n\nScout’s supporters argue that the direct model aligns with evolving consumer expectations shaped by online retail and digital services. They contend that eliminating intermediaries can reduce friction and cost while offering buyers a more transparent experience. Scout’s leadership has expressed optimism about consumer demand for its Terra pickup and Traveler SUV, even as dealer pushback grows.\n\nAt its core, the conflict encapsulates a broader industry transformation. Traditional dealers emphasize their local economic impact and service capacity. Direct-to-consumer proponents highlight efficiency and modern customer engagement. As Scout and similar brands expand, the legal, economic, and political wrangling will likely continue, shaping how Americans buy vehicles in the decades ahead.",

Some final tows were needed and some salt treatments were required on the roadway.\n\nAccording to state police, several small crashes may be the culprit rather than one large pile-up.\n\nCooper, a driver who was caught in the middle of the chain of freeway crashes, said that the snow squall created a white-out condition. His car slammed underneath a semi-truck, he said - coming away injured somehow.\n\n\"It was a whiteout with no visibility and like I said, everyone was going 25 or 30 until they weren't. My car got totaled,\" he said.\n\nThe exact number of vehicles involved, is not known at this time.  All lanes were blocked.\n\n\"Some of the semis may have struggled, some of the cars may have struggled, whatever it is this is probably going to (last) the majority of the day,\" said Diane Cross of MDOT in a phone interview with FOX 2. \"At the moment we have northbound 75 closed at McNichols. Don't be surprised if we move that back to the Davison so that traffic can move freeway to freeway.\"\n\nCross said that special towing vehicles were needed for the semi-trucks.\n\n\"We have EMS, Michigan State Police out there to determine the cause.\"\n\nAccording to MDOT, the left shoulder, left lane, right center lane, right lane and right shoulder are all blocked.\n\nThe backup stretched for miles with an early estimate of at least 20 vehicles or more.\n\nRoad conditions have been challenging all day due to an active winter weather day that began with fierce winds and continued with blinding snow squalls.\n\nWest M-10 and Woodward are possible alternate routes according to Cross.\n\nPower outages have been reported by DTE Energy while a number of flights have been delayed or canceled at Metropolitan Airport in Romulus.\n\nStay with FOX 2 \n\nInformation for this report is from MDOT and multiple sources.",

    "description": "The owner of the house and her family have four cars, so they spill slightly onto the lawn when parked—which is where the town takes issue.",
    "fullText": "Parking in a driveway is about as mundane as parking can get. It's not as fancy as in a garage. It's not as potentially dangerous as parking on a street. And yet, in this story, it's led to a six-figure fine that the Florida Supreme Court has decided to let stand after several years of litigation.\n\nWhile the state's Supreme Court didn't endorse the fine, according to CBS News, it declined to review the case of Sandy Martinez, a single mother who has spent several years fighting fines that have now ballooned to $165,000 and counting. Over $100,000 of those fines relate directly to Ms. Martinez parking her cars on her driveway and slightly onto her grass. Her home isn't home to her alone; her son, daughter, and sister all live with her. All four of them have full-time jobs, and each of them has their own car. The house itself is on a corner lot, so street parking isn't available. As such, they line their cars up across the four-car driveway.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the four cars always ends up having to park slightly onto the grass in the yard that Martinez owns. According to the city of Lantana, that's unacceptable, and as a result it has fined her $250 a day for over a year.\n\nThe Institute for Justice has stepped in, and is representing Martinez. “Six-figure fines for parking on your own property are shocking,” IJ senior attorney Ari Bargil told CBS News, following the court’s decision not to take up the case. “The court’s refusal to hear Sandy’s case is a disservice to all Floridians.”\n\nFor Martinez, options moving forward are extremely limited. CBS News says Florida's Homestead Protection Act shields her from foreclosure, but it's destroyed the equity she'd built up in her home. She can't retry the case in Florida either, and given the Supreme Court's ruling, it's unlikely that a federal court would hear the case.\n\nYou Need a Torque Wrench in Your Toolbox\n\nTested: Best Car Interior Cleaners",

    "title": "This Brand Makes The Worst Cars, According To Consumer Reports",
    "description": "When looking for a car to buy, it's important to take a look at its reliability. Before you buy, here's what Consumer Reports says is the worst brand.",
    "fullText": "To say that one particular brand or company makes the worst cars is a bold statement. After all, labeling a vehicle the best or worst can be very subjective. Some buyers, for example, might be willing to deal with less-than-stellar long-term reliability in exchange for the performance or image you get with a European luxury brand. Others might happily trade performance and excitement for the peace of mind that comes with great reliability.\n\nHowever, when it comes to objectively ranking current car brands from best to worst by using the same standards, Consumer Reports is hard to beat. CR uses a variety of its test metrics and survey results to compile a regularly updated list of the industry's best and worst brands. The latest version, which includes 31 different brands, has ranked Jeep as the worst of the bunch.\n\nThis is a bit disconcerting, given that Jeep is one of America's most storied vehicle brands, with lots of loyal fans and owners. But it's also not a surprising result, given that Jeep has had a lot of well-publicized recall and safety issues recently. The result also shows quite starkly that just because a vehicle is capable or exciting off the showroom floor, it doesn't mean it's necessarily going to be a smart purchase when it comes to long-term ownership satisfaction.\n\nConsumer Reports comes up with its best and worst brand rankings by looking at several different factors, including reliability and owner satisfaction surveys, initial road test reviews, and safety ratings. And in Jeep's defense, some of the negatives that CR considers (poor fuel economy for example) are likely already known and considered by buyers going in, and are probably accepted as a trade-off for Jeep's famous off-road capability.  However, what's harder to defend is Jeep's position at the very bottom of CR's owner satisfaction rankings, with only about half of current Jeep owners saying they would buy one again.\n\nBeyond Consumer Reports rankings, the relatively poor quality and questionable reliability of Jeep products are not a big secret. The brand has been plagued with high-profile recalls lately, especially on its 4xe hybrid models. In the last year alone, Jeep 4xes have been hit with some huge recalls, including one with a risk of complete engine failures and even worse, a fire risk from faulty 4xe battery cells. And that's a big deal because it's not just a mechanical failure, but a safety risk to both the vehicle and the house or garage where it's parked. Additionally, casual surveys of mechanics, for example, have shown Jeep to be one of the more trouble-prone brands, with other Stellantis-owned names (like Dodge and Chrysler) also joining their list of brands that 'pay the rent'.\n\nEven from a high-level view, the reliability and quality issues around Jeep are sad to see. Because Jeep isn't just another car brand trying to get its piece of the pie. Jeep is one of the American auto industry's most storied names, and one that's heavily tied into America's adventurous spirit. Increasingly, though, that adventurous spirit has as much to do with recalls and repairs as it does tackling remote trails and exploring far-off wilderness.\n\nThis is not all to say that you should completely avoid buying or leasing a new Jeep, but the sketchy track record of reliability, and the possibility of your vehicle spending a lot of time at the dealership is absolutely something to consider. Where Consumer Reports' ratings become more of a red flag warning is when it comes to buying a used Jeep. Because it's one thing to have a trouble-prone vehicle that's under factory warranty, and another thing to have an out-of-warranty vehicle where you take on significant financial risk if repairs are needed.\n\nIt should be said, though, that Jeep's less-than-great reputation for reliability is not a new thing, and that hasn't stopped many hardcore Jeep fans and otherwise happy owners from enjoying their vehicles.   On the other hand, if you are not in the mood for risk-taking and are wondering about Consumer Reports' picks for best reliability, you'll not surprisingly find a couple of long-time favorite Japanese brands topping the most recent rankings.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "description": "SUVs remain popular, but with a multitude of models, it can be hard to choose the best one. These SUVs are some of the best, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
    "fullText": "Sport utility vehicles, or SUVs, are vehicles that have the tough frame of a truck but provide enough interior room for multiple passengers and cargo. And they aren't just popular among retirees with grandchildren or people fond of bulk shopping trips to stock up on items at Costco. There were $528 billion worth of SUV transactions in 2024 across the globe, a figure that is expected to swell to just over $876 billion by 2032, per Stellar Market Research. And SUVs and trucks were the best selling vehicles of the first three quarters of 2025 in the United States, according to Car and Driver.\n\nAs a byproduct of their popularity, SUVs come in so many forms and models of varying quality that it is enough to put a car shopper into a fetal position of indecision, especially if you don't want to end up with a popular yet unreliable SUV. Fortunately, there's Kelley Blue Book, which has been a valuable source for automobile buyers since 1926. In early 2025, Kelley Blue Book came out with its Best Buy awards, which included Hyundai Kona, Honda CR-V, Kia Telluride, Ford Expedition, and Kia EV9. To give you a complete picture, we've included analyses and reviews from other online car sources in the roundup below.\n\nRated as the best subcompact SUV, the Hyundai Kona is described by Kelley Blue Book as a roomy, comfortable, fuel-efficient vehicle that can get about 31 miles for the gallon. With a starting price of about $25,900, Hyundai Kona can seat five people with just over 38 inches of leg room and can carry 25.5 cubic feet of cargo, or a maximum of 63.7 cubic feet when the second-row seats are folded down. The vehicle comes equipped with a 12.3-inch infotainment display and an optional all-wheel drive. Plus, the 2025 Kona is equipped with standard safety features such as collision warning with automatic emergency braking and blind-spot monitoring.\n\nYet according to Edmunds, the 2025 Hyundai Kona's acceleration abilities are \"underwhelming,\" while its suspension is not all that great, making it a less-than-ideal vehicle for off-roading (the model still got a 7.8 out of 10 rating). Consumer Reports, though, rated the 2025 Hyundai Kona overall reliability at 41 out of 100, about average for that model year.\n\nIn terms of costs to fix and maintain, CarEdge estimated that a Hyundai Kona will cost $8,463 over its first ten years, which is $297 more than non-luxury SUVs. As for how quickly this car can depreciate, CarEdge says it will lose 42% of its value after five years. That's better than the 53% depreciation of a Wagoneer, a popular Jeep with terrible resale value.\n\nKelley Blue Book compared the 2025 Honda CR-V — the winner of the best compact SUV category — to the brightest start in the sky for its quality, tech features, and the 76.5 cubic feet of cargo space it can provide once you fold down the rear seats. Though compact, the CR-V provides 41 inches of legroom for its rear seats along with reclining backs. And its hybrid versions can give up to 40 miles per gallon.\n\nBut where the CR-V truly excels is in its resale value, which Kelley Blue Book reports can fetch thousands of dollars more than its competitors due to the Honda brand's reputation for reliability. CarEdge agreed, putting its depreciation at just 29% over its first five years.\n\nWith a starting price of $31,495, the Honda CR-V costs $7,696 to fix and maintain in its first ten years of service, which is $530 less than the average for other popular SUV models. Also: Car and Driver called the 2025 model year a solid vehicle that's high in demand, and Edmunds gave it a 7.1 out of 10. However, this model was part of a recall ordered on Honda vehicles by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for potential fuel leaks and possibly incorrectly manufactured bad steering gearboxes.\n\nThe winner of the best midsize SUV for the sixth year in a row, the 2025 Kia Telluride has a three-row configuration that can seat eight, a Mercedez-Benz-quality dual-display infotainment touchscreen, 21 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row, and a total of 87 cubic feet with the two rear rows folded down, according to Kelley Blue Book. The model, which starts at about $37,800, also comes with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, and a host of other safety features.\n\nIn terms of reliability, Consumer Reports gives it an average with a score of 60 out of 100, although the vehicle also scored 72 out of 100 for owner satisfaction. Edmunds gives it a 7.1 out of 10 rating, while Car and Driver stated that Kia Telluride's standard features approach luxury standards. As for its resale value, the Kia Telluride will depreciate 51% in its first five years, according to CarEdge, and will cost $8,730 to maintain and fix in its first 10 years, which is $564 more than typical SUVs.\n\nThe '25 Ford Expedition took Kelley Blue Book's best full-size SUV award for its three-row spacious interior with plentiful cupholders and USB-C ports, ability to tow trailers up to 9,600 pounds, and a variety of trims, like the Expedition Tremor, that are great for transverse unpaved trails. With a starting price of $64,515, it has a mobile Wi-Fi hotspot that allows people to stream music and audiobooks as well as videos when parked. There is even a Bluetooth controller for people to play online games. The second row has tablet holders on the back of the front seat headrests, and there is a 13.2-inch infotainment touchscreen for navigation and climate control. The vehicle also comes with a safety package that includes a 360-degree camera, emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and blind-spot and lane-keeping assist functions.\n\nOn the downside, according to Consumer Reports, the 2025 Ford Expedition is less reliable than the average car, with a reliability rating of 30 out of 100. It also costs $10,226 to maintain a Ford Expedition model in its first ten years of ownership, which is $2,060 more than other popular SUV models, per CarEdge. Ford Expeditions also depreciate 59% in five years, with a ranking of 164 out of 185 models analyzed by CarEdge for resale value.\n\nLarge enough to seat seven people, the Kia EV9 won Kelley Blue Book's Best Buy spot for 3-row EVs. An electric midsized SUV with prices that start at $56,395, the Kia EV9 can seat seven people comfortably, has a maximum range of 304 miles, and can get 150 miles worth of range after charging for only 15 minutes.\n\nEdmunds gave the model 8.2 out of 10, but Consumer Reports deemed the 2025 Kia EV9 less reliable than other cars of the same model year. There were also three recalls ordered by NHTSA because of a badly welded gear shift that causes the vehicle to lose power (342 vehicles for year 2025); possible missing bolts in the second and third row seats (22,883 vehicles for years 2024 and 2025); and a failing instrument panel screen for speed and other info (14,163 vehicles for years 2024 and 2025).\n\nBut if those issues are addressed by dealerships free of charge, as expected, the Kia EV9 is projected to cost $5,237 to maintain and fix in its first 10 years, which is $2,929 better than the average SUV, per CarEdge. However, in five years it will lose 52% of its value.\n\nUnlock your financial potential. Add Money Digest to your preferred sources for smart money insights!",

    "title": "Solid-state batteries charge faster, last longer: review",
    "description": "Solid-state batteries are poised to transform everything from electric cars to consumer electronics, and represent a transformational leap in energy storage.",
    "fullText": "Solid-state batteries charge in a fraction of the time, run cooler, and pack more energy into less space than traditional lithium-ion versions.\n\nA new review from the University of California, Riverside, published in Nano Energy, explains why this technology is poised to transform everything from electric cars to consumer electronics, and represents a major leap in energy storage.\n\nThese batteries replace the flammable liquid found in standard versions with a solid material that is safer and far more efficient. Where today’s batteries may take 30 to 45 minutes to reach 80% charge, solid-state models can cut that time to 12 minutes, and in some cases, as little as three.\n\nLead author Cengiz Ozkan, a professor of mechanical engineering at UCR, said the benefits come down to chemistry and engineering. “By removing the liquid and using stable solid materials instead, we can safely push more electricity into the battery at once, without the risks of overheating or fires,” he said.\n\nConventional lithium-ion batteries move lithium ions, the particles that carry electric charge, through a liquid. But that liquid can degrade over time, limit charging speed, and pose fire risks. Solid-state batteries use a solid material instead, which offers a safer and more stable environment for lithium ions to move through. This enables faster, more efficient charging with fewer safety concerns.\n\nThe solid inside these batteries is known as a solid-state electrolyte. The review highlights three main types: sulfide-based, oxide-based, and polymer-based. Each type has strengths: some allow ions to move faster, others offer better long-term stability or are easier to manufacture. One standout group, sulfide-based electrolytes, performs almost as well as the liquid in current batteries, but without the downsides.\n\nThe researchers also describe the tools scientists now use to watch batteries work in real time. Techniques like neutron imaging and high-powered X-rays let researchers see how lithium moves inside a battery as it charges and discharges. This helps identify areas where the lithium gets stuck or where unwanted structures called “dendrites” start to grow. Dendrites are tiny, needle-like formations that can cause a battery to short-circuit or fail.\n\nUnderstanding these inner workings is key to making better batteries. “These imaging tools are like an MRI for batteries,” Ozkan said. “They let us watch the battery’s vital signs and make smarter design choices.”\n\nSolid-state batteries also tend to use lithium more efficiently. Many designs feature a lithium metal layer that can store more energy in less space than the graphite layers used in current batteries. This means solid-state batteries can be lighter and smaller while still powering devices for just as long, or longer.\n\nWhile conventional lithium-ion batteries typically begin to show noticeable degradation after approximately 5–8 years of use in electric vehicles, solid-state batteries could remain functional for 15–20 years or more, depending on usage and environmental factors.\n\n“Traditional lithium-ion batteries, while revolutionary, are reaching their performance and safety limits as electric vehicles, renewable energy grids, portable electronics, and aerospace systems become more widespread and demanding,” Ozkan said.\n\nOzkan said solid-state batteries could also play a pivotal role in the future of interstellar travel and space exploration.\n\nDue to their thermal and chemical stability, these batteries are better suited to withstand extreme temperatures and radiation conditions in outer space. They’re also able to store more power in less space, which is critical for missions where every cubic centimeter counts. And without liquid electrolytes, they would be more reliable in closed, oxygen-controlled environments like spacecraft or planetary bases.\n\nThe researchers’ goal with this review was to guide researchers and technologists in accelerating the development, scalability, and real-world deployment of solid-state systems.\n\nBut challenges remain. Making these batteries on a large scale is still difficult and expensive. The paper offers a roadmap for solving these problems, including developing better materials, refining how the battery parts interact, and improving factory techniques to make production easier.\n\n“Solid-state batteries are moving closer to reality every day,” Ozkan said. “Our review shows how far the science has come and what steps are needed next to make these batteries available for everyday use.”\n\n(Cover image of solid-state batteries: Just_Super/Getty)",

    "title": "How Reliable Are Volkswagens? Here's What Consumer Reports Says",
    "description": "Consumer Reports amasses quite a bit of data about automotive manufacturers and surveys owners about reliability. Here's how Volkswagen currently ranks.",
    "fullText": "Volkswagen is one of the oldest and biggest car manufacturers in the world. For almost nine decades, the brand has lived through the early dominance of the Beetle, its rise as an automotive giant through acquisitions of Audi and Porsche, and, more recently, Dieselgate. VW's modern car lineup includes compact cars, SUVs, crossovers, and electric vehicles like the Volkswagen ID Buzz, which has the best vibes of any new car on sale. Within this large lineup of cars, specs and features vary — but how reliable are Volkswagens in general?\n\nAccording to a Consumer Reports (CR) 2025 reliability survey ranking 26 different major brands, Volkswagen ranks 16th. The Golf GTI is the most reliable model in the current VW lineup, while the compact Taos ranks as the least reliable. These numbers place VW slightly below average. RepairPal ranks VW reliability numbers at 3.5 out of 5.0, which puts it as 12th across 32 different brands. These numbers tell you something, but not everything. Individual cars can perform very differently, so buyer beware: Picking the right VW model matters.\n\nThe ratings CR provides are based on real owner experiences in the past 12 months. Specifically, CR compiled data on 380,000 vehicles and separated that data into 20 different trouble areas that include the engine, transmission, in-car electronics, body hardware, and EV components. According to CR, the Taos \"is less reliable than other cars from the same model year.\" It isn't all bad ratings for Volkswagen, though.\n\nRepairPal is an independent automotive data company that bases its reliability ratings on millions of real-world repair invoices, historical statistics, and predictive data modeling. Based on their assessments, the Jetta, Golf, and Passat are \"above average\" in reliability, while the Tiguan and the Golf GTI are \"average.\" To further complicate things, the picture shifts slightly when looking at used cars. In a separate 2025 CR study of used car reliability, Volkswagen is placed 13th out of 26 brands.\n\nThat placement isn't a complete game changer, but it's a bit better than VW's rating with new vehicles. In another hit to VW, a dependability study from J.D. Power that tracks reliability ratings for cars up to three years of age, placed Volkswagen at the very bottom of all brands, with an average of 285 problems across 100 vehicles. However, VW Jetta reliability is rated \"Great\" while the Golf GTI is only \"Average.\" The Taos — one of the least satisfying SUVs you can buy – is also \"Average.\"\n\nVolkswagen is a major player in the U.S. car market, consistently ranking among the top-selling automotive brands. More than 10 years after the PR disaster that was Dieselgate, Volkswagen sold 316,504 vehicles in the U.S. in 2024 — a 19.4% year‑over‑year increase — suggesting that, despite its underwhelming projected reliability and past scandals, VW is a strong choice with buyers.\n\nVW's best-selling models with U.S. buyers are the Tiguan, the Atlas, and the Jetta. The usual benefit VW enjoys compared to its German counterparts is that it offers German engineering at a cheaper price. VW does not match Mercedes, Audi, and BMW in terms of luxury, despite some higher-end models, but it does share some of its platforms with Audi. This means that Volkswagen, although it isn't as premium as Mercedes or BMW, does not suffer from costs typically associated with luxury brands.\n\nAccording to RepairPal, the average annual repair costs for a VW are $676. Compared to premium brands like BMW at $968 and Audi at $987, Volkswagens seem like a practical choice, especially if you are worried about long-term repair costs. On the economy-side of the spectrum, Toyota, the brand with the best-selling passenger car of 2025, averages $441 in annual repair costs.\n\nWant more like this?

    "fullText": "A look back at the biggest tech stories of the year, from the rise and fall of Musk’s Doge to lucrative investments into AI\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, wishing you a happy and healthy end of the year. I myself have a cold.\n\nToday, we are looking back at the biggest stories in tech of 2025 – Elon Musk’s political rise, burst, and fall; artificial intelligence’s subsumption of the global economy, all other technology, and even the Earth’s topography; Australia’s remarkable social media ban; the tech industry’s new Trumpian politics; and, as a treat, a glimpse of the apocalypse offered by one of Silicon Valley’s savviest and strangest billionaires.\n\nAt the close of 2024, I wrote that Elon Musk’s support of Donald Trump had made him the world’s most powerful unelected man. In 2025, his reign turned out to be short-lived. He rose fast and haphazardly, like a whizzing firework, only to explode spectacularly in June when he claimed in a post on X that the president of the United States was named in the government’s files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEven in that short period of less than six months, Musk made a tremendous impact. He tore up wide swaths of the US government – tens of thousands of jobs, the security of extremely sensitive data, and entire agencies like USAID – that may never be stitched back together.\n\nAfter Doge imploded, Musk promised to turn back to his business empire, which saw great success and great failures alike in 2025. His rocket company SpaceX saw continued growth and is poised to conduct an initial public offering next year, perhaps as the most valuable private company in the world. Electric carmaker Tesla, by contrast, faced violent backlash and major competition from its Chinese counterparts, which produced cheaper and more advanced vehicles while Tesla’s innovation and inventory stagnated. These headwinds caused a global sales slump for Musk’s carmaker.\n\nLook back at our reporting on Doge, Tesla, SpaceX, Musk himself:\n\nThe “department of government efficiency”\n\nHow an obscure US government office has become a target of Elon Musk\n\nHow Elon Musk’s billionaire Doge lieutenant took over the US’s biggest MDMA company | Technology | The Guardian\n\nThe chaos Elon Musk and Doge are leaving behind in Washington\n\nTesla faces backlash over Musk’s politics\n\nEggings, swastikas and dog poop: Tesla bears brunt of people’s ire against Musk\n\n‘I’m selling the Nazi mobile’: Tesla owners offload cars after Musk’s fascist-style salutes\n\nLook ahead: SpaceX expands in preparation for 2026 IPO\n\nInside Elon Musk’s plan to rain SpaceX’s rocket debris over Hawaii’s pristine waters\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX ‘preparing for flotation that could value it at over $1tn’\n\nArtificial intelligence has gone from a niche within tech to the industry’s most prominent focus. The Magnificent Seven – Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla – are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into new software that they hope will do the bulk of humanity’s work before too long. The investment is driving the bulk of the growth of the US’s economy, giving rise to fears of a financial bubble and its popping. The US and China are locked in a cold war-esque race against each other, with startups in each country vying for cutting-edge breakthroughs, as governments around the world are forced to decide how they will regulate a new technological force.\n\nBefore AI can arrive at that future, though, it needs brains a la the Tin Man of The Wizard of Oz. Those brains come in the form of data centers. These massive buildings, which house the millions and millions of semiconductor chips booming AI development, have cropped up around the world, met with enthusiasm from leaders eager for tax revenue and deep concern from environmental advocates and, increasingly, local community members. The investment in and construction of data centers wrought huge change in the physical landscape of the Earth in 2025 as tens of billions of dollars chased any available land, electricity, water and semiconductor chips.\n\nMore from our reporting in the last year:\n\nThe AI boom is heralding a new gold rush in the American west\n\nRevealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areas\n\nWhat will your life look like in 2035?\n\n‘It’s going much too fast’: the inside story of the race to create the ultimate AI\n\nMulti-trillion-dollar valuations\n\nIs AI a bubble that’s about to pop? – podcast\n\nWhat is new in UK-US tech deal and what will it mean for the British economy?\n\nMeet the AI workers who tell their friends and family to stay away from AI\n\nElon Musk made a full-throated and whole-hearted embrace of Donald Trump in 2024 and 2025. He was not alone. Many of his fellows in Silicon Valley did the same, sitting beside the Trump family at the president’s inauguration after donating millions to his inaugural committee.

    "description": "Clint Crawford has a message for parents who are concerned about the shortage of white-collar entry-level work: open their minds to the possibility of a fulfilling career otherwise.",
    "fullText": "When something breaks—whether it’s the plumbing or a car—the first call most people make is to a blue-collar worker. That was the lesson he wanted his children to understand.\n\nClint Crawford is a 55-year-old automotive technician at Midas Auto and Repair Shop in Arkansas. He has a message for parents who are concerned about the shortage of white-collar entry-level work: open their minds to the possibility of a fulfilling career elsewhere.\n\nLike the conversation Ford CEO Jim Farley described having at his own dinner table with his son, Crawford believes it should be a debate—one that needs to happen at dinner tables across the country.\n\n“They need to be introduced to alternatives, and we need to place an equal importance on technical programs,” he asserts.\n\nCrawford has a 22-year-old daughter and a 21-year-old son. Both went to college, but it wasn’t expected of them as the default while growing up, as he worked to emphasize the dignity and stability that comes with blue-collar careers.\n\n“If something happens with the plumbing, the first call is either the landlord or the plumber,” Crawford tells Fortune, adding that when a car breaks down, the first call goes to a repair shop.\n\n“The first call that most people are going to make is to that blue-collar worker.”\n\nThose were the examples he gave his children when counseling them on what career to pursue, believing that such workers are essential to the running of the economy and to the smooth functioning of everyday life.\n\n“That way, they could understand that there are options,” Crawford says.\n\nHe also urged his children to be realistic, something many parents can now relate to. While the majority of parents still prefer a four-year college education for their children, a new survey from American Student Assistance found that 35% believe some form of technical education or a blue-collar career may be better suited for their child. In 2019, that figure was 13%.\n\nAnd it makes sense. Most white-collar entry-level jobs require a college degree, which has become a severe economic burden for younger generations. According to a 2024 report by the Education Data Initiative, the average Gen Zer has $22,948 of student loan debt. In addition, companies have reduced their rates of hiring entry-level employees, in part due to tariff disruptions as well as AI automating some of these early work experiences.\n\nCrawford himself was concerned when his son decided to study data science, having heard—like many others—about struggles in hiring. But he realized that “it’s something that he enjoys, and he’s good at. And so computer science it is.”\n\nIdeally, Crawford believes schools and parents should start these types of conversations early on. For his kids, they decided college was, in fact, right for them. But they had a conversation, which he encourages others to have.\n\nFor Crawford’s family, career discussions took place before his kids earned college degrees, and he encouraged his kids to be practical.\n\n“I think a lot of times parents are telling their kids, you know, do what makes you happy.” That’s great, he says, but adds that “the reason we work is to pay bills.” If a worker can’t do that or is underpaid, “it just seems pointless.”\n\nCrawford believes people should consider these jobs as valid options that offer stability—something that seems hard-won these days. Young people should be offered aptitude tests to help determine what kind of work best aligns with their skills. When someone is good at math, he believes they should be encouraged to pursue blue-collar careers that require highly logical and math-heavy processes.\n\nCrawford has found that electricians are “incredibly math-oriented” and that liking math doesn’t mean you have to be a mathematician.\n\n“There are plenty of opportunities out there that require a strong background in math that don’t limit you to teaching math at the high school or college level,” he adds.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

The 8.4% year-over-year increase was accompanied by a 1% rise in market share to 15.5%.\n\nCar buyers may have been nervous about prices after President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement, but carmakers have eased those concerns by offering incentives.",

    "fullText": "DETROIT, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Ford CEO Jim Farley walked through Ford’s Michigan design studio Monday afternoon, reflecting on how he was about to wipe out thousands of work hours on electric vehicles that he and his team had hoped would revolutionize the American auto industry.\n\nShortly after, his company announced it would kill several of those battery-powered models and take a $19.5 billion writedown on EV-related assets. It marked the industry’s ​biggest electric-vehicle retreat since U.S. President Donald Trump’s sweeping auto-policy changes iced already cooling EV demand.\n\nFarley had spent years telling staff and investors that catching up to Tesla and China’s leading EV makers amounted to an existential struggle. ‌Now – after losing about $13 billion on EVs since 2023 – Farley says the path to survival lies in ditching these unprofitable models.\n\n“We can't allocate money for things that will not make money,” he told Reuters on Monday. “As much as I love those products, the customers in the U.S. were not going to pay for ‌them. And that was the end of that.”\n\nFarley’s angst reflects the broader conundrum facing auto executives in the wake of Trump-administration policies that stripped the industry of EV subsidies and eased restrictions on tailpipe pollution.\n\nMost automakers now can’t sell EVs in the U.S. profitably or in volume – but must sell them in China, Europe and other markets to appease regulators and compete with Chinese automakers expanding globally.\n\nThat’s left Ford and other automakers with the challenge of tailoring vastly different vehicle lineups for different regions.\n\nThe approach layers on extra expenses the industry thought it had left behind in recent decades through globalization – making essentially the same car, with common supply chains, to sell worldwide. Fifteen years ago, then-CEO Alan Mulally called the strategy ‘One Ford.’\n\nNow Farley needs many Fords. His company and others have been turning to partnerships to absorb ⁠the extra costs of catering to different global markets. Renault and Ford earlier this month ‌announced they would partner to build affordable EVs for Europe.\n\nFollowing the partnership announcement, Ford said Monday it won’t build the electric commercial van it initially planned for that market. Ford has also been seeking a Chinese partner to provide EV platform technologies, Reuters has reported.\n\nOn EVs, Farley hopes to thread the needle by killing most EV models but preserving a $30,000 midsize electric truck due out in 2027, ‍which a specialized skunkworks team in California has engineered to take on EV powerhouses Tesla and China's BYD.",

    "description": "Mykhailo Fedorov said the drone was powered by a motor built in Ukraine. Its reported speed nearly rivals the fastest high-speed trains in the world.",
    "fullText": "A small Ukrainian drone built to chase down and intercept other aerial systems has recently achieved a speed of 400 kmph, or 248.5 mph, Kyiv's digital transformation minister said on Tuesday.\n\n\"400 km/h — that's the speed reached by an interceptor drone powered by a motor from Motor-G, a member of Brave1UA,\" Mykhailo Fedorov wrote in a social media post. Brave1 is Ukraine's defense innovation platform.\n\nSuch a velocity means that the interceptor can beat the official speed record for Formula 1 racing, achieved by Valtteri Bottas in 2016 at 231.46 mph.\n\nA speed of 248.5 mph also allows the drone to nearly match the fastest high-speed trains in the world. The Shanghai Maglev, for example, reached speeds of 280 mph during tests in October, but is commercially operated at 186 mph.\n\nAnd a motor-powered interceptor would be doing so with propellers, rather than the jet engines or high-thrust combustion systems that propel other vehicles to extreme speeds. Because interceptor drones are designed to destroy other drones at a low cost, Ukraine's manufacturers typically price them below $6,000 each.\n\nIt's another sign of how quickly the war is transforming the local weapons industry, which has turned hobbyist drones into some of the fastest yet cheapest aircraft on the battlefield. Four months ago, another Ukrainian interceptor drew widespread attention for reaching 195 mph in flight.\n\nUkraine is now ramping up ambitions to export such war technology, saying that its locally built missiles, drones, and anti-air systems have been tried and tested against Russia.\n\nA video posted by Fedorov on Tuesday said that producing drone motors in Ukraine \"seemed impossible\" just two years ago, but that Motor-G is now making 100,000 motors a month.\n\n\"Today, more and more drones are flying on motors made in Ukraine,\" the minister wrote.\n\nKyiv has been particularly focused on increasing the speed of its interceptors because Russia has been developing its own versions of the Iranian Shahed, which are long-range attack drones.\n\nThe most commonly used models of these loitering munitions fly at roughly 115 to 180 mph, and are often released in large numbers to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses. The Russian tactic created the urgent need for Ukraine to develop cheap ways to destroy the Shaheds, which led to the rise of interceptor drones.\n\nHowever, Moscow has been repeatedly reported to be experimenting with smaller waves of new jet-powered Shaheds, which are believed to reach speeds of 230 mph.\n\nTheir emergence at the start of the year initially sparked fears in Ukraine that they would be too fast for interceptors to catch, though recent reports and war footage indicate that Ukrainian manufacturers have managed to close the gap.\n\nOne jet-powered Shahed, for example, was filmed being approached by a Ukrainian interceptor from behind in late November.",

    "fullText": "The 1970s gave us muscle cars, oil crises, and some truly wild automotive experiments. While everyone's chasing Camaros and Corvettes at auctions, there's a whole world of fascinating machines from that decade that fly under the radar.\n\nThese overlooked cars offer character, quirky engineering, and surprisingly solid performance without the six-figure price tags. Some were ahead of their time, others were wonderfully weird, and a few were just plain misunderstood.\n\nAlright, time to check out these gems from the '70s that deserve more love from collectors.\n\nThe Gremlin gets mocked for its chopped-off rear end, but this little oddball was actually pretty clever. AMC created it by literally cutting down a Hornet to compete in the subcompact market, and it worked.\n\nWith optional V8 power, the Gremlin could surprise unsuspecting muscle cars at stoplights, and its quirky styling has aged into legitimate charm. You could get one with a 304 cubic inch V8 that made around 150 horsepower, which was respectable for the era.\n\nWhile collectors chase AMX models, clean Gremlins remain affordable and are starting to earn respect as honest, unpretentious American compacts.\n\nThe wedge-shaped TR7 was supposed to be Triumph's answer to modern sports car design, and while it had production issues, the driving experience was genuinely fun. Its \"wedge\" design was polarizing, earning the tagline \"The Shape of Things to Come,\" though reliability concerns overshadowed its decent handling.\n\nThe four-cylinder engine produced about 92 horsepower in North American spec, which sounds modest but kept the car nimble and engaging. Later TR8 models got a V8, but even the standard TR7 offers an accessible entry into British sports car ownership.\n\nThese days, you can find them for a fraction of what you'd pay for an MGB or Spitfire.\n\nBefore the 240Z became a collector darling, Datsun was building sensible sedans that happened to be incredibly well-engineered. The 710 was a reliable, practical sedan that competed with Toyota Corollas but somehow never achieved the same nostalgic status.\n\nIts 2.0-liter engine made around 94–97 horsepower (SAE net), depending on emissions spec and could reliably cruise all day without complaint. The wagon versions are particularly appealing today, offering classic lines and surprising cargo space.\n\nWhile collectors obsess over Z-cars, the humble 710 represents Datsun's commitment to quality without demanding classic car prices.\n\nSold through Mercury dealers, the Capri II was a captive import from Ford of Europe rather than a traditional American pony car. Built in Germany, it brought European hatchback styling and a more refined driving feel to the U.S. market at a time when domestic performance cars were shrinking.\n\nPower came from sensible options like the 2.3-liter four-cylinder or an optional 2.8-liter V6, prioritizing balance and fuel economy over straight-line speed.\n\nWhile it never tried to compete directly with muscle cars, the Capri II offered tidy handling, distinctive fastback styling, and a level of character that set it apart from its American contemporaries. Overshadowed by Mustangs and later fox-body Capris, the Capri II remains an overlooked slice of 1970s transatlantic automotive history.\n\nThis mid-engine, targa-topped Italian was designed by Bertone and offered sports car thrills in an affordable package. With just about 75 horsepower from its 1.5-liter engine, the X1/9 wasn't about straight-line speed but rather handling and driver engagement.\n\nThe mid-engine layout gave it phenomenal balance, making it a blast on twisty roads. Its removable roof panel predated the Miata's popularity by decades and offered open-air driving without sacrificing structural rigidity.\n\nWhile Fiat's rust reputation scared some buyers away, well-maintained examples prove that proper Italian sports cars don't need big price tags.\n\nThe Volaré replaced the beloved Valiant and initially suffered quality issues, but the platform itself was quite capable. Once Chrysler sorted out the early problems, these became solid, dependable cars with comfortable rides.\n\nYou could option them with everything from slant-six engines to 360 cubic inch V8s making around 160–170 horsepower (SAE net), depending on year/trim. The Road Runner package added some muscle car DNA to a practical body, creating an interesting sleeper.\n\nEarlier Mopars often get all the love, but clean examples represent affordable entry into Chrysler performance heritage.\n\nBefore Subaru became synonymous with crossovers, they built a compact pickup truck with rear-facing jump seats in the bed. The BRAT (Bi-drive Recreational All-terrain Transporter) cleverly avoided the chicken tax by including those seats, classifying it as a passenger vehicle.\n\nIts four-wheel drive system was ahead of its time for a small truck, and the about 67 horsepower from its flat-four engine was adequate for the lightweight body. The quirky design and practical utility made it perfect for outdoor enthusiasts.\n\nToday, rust-free BRATs are increasingly hard to find, but they remain much more affordable than vintage Toyota trucks.\n\nThe Alfetta brought Italian performance engineering to the sedan market with its unique transaxle layout for perfect weight distribution. Named after Alfa's successful racing cars, it featured a rear-mounted transmission that helped achieve 50/50 balance.\n\nThe four-cylinder engine produced around 109-130 PS but delivered smooth power and that distinctive Alfa character. Its handling was exceptional for a sedan, rewarding drivers who appreciated precise steering and responsive chassis dynamics.\n\nWhile collectors chase Spiders and GTVs, the Alfetta sedan offers genuine Alfa driving pleasure without the premium prices.\n\nThe Vega had serious quality issues at launch, but the GT version with its sport suspension and styling upgrades was actually entertaining to drive. Its aluminum-block four-cylinder was innovative if flawed, producing around 85 horsepower (SAE net) in typical mid-’70s GT spec (varies by year/engine option).\n\nThe lightweight body and decent handling made it competitive in autocross and club racing. Many enthusiasts have discovered that dropping in a small-block V8 turns the Vega into a genuine pocket rocket.\n\nSure, the reputation keeps values low, but that means more opportunity for builders and drivers who want an affordable project.\n\nFrench engineering excellence doesn't get enough credit in American collector circles, and the 504 proves that point beautifully. This sedan won European Car of the Year and featured independent suspension, comfortable seating, and surprisingly robust construction.\n\nThe fuel-injected four-cylinder made around 96 horsepower but delivered smooth, refined power delivery. Its ride quality was exceptional, combining European handling with comfortable long-distance cruising.\n\nWhile Citroëns get the quirky attention, the 504 represents practical French design that actually worked reliably in American conditions.\n\nBefore the RX-7 became a rotary icon, Mazda built the smaller RX-3 with the same spinning triangle magic. U.S.-market RX-3s used the larger 12A rotary, with published outputs closer to about 90 horsepower in North American spec; the engine’s willingness to rev was a big part of the appeal.\n\nRacing versions dominated their classes in IMSA competition, proving the chassis was more than just economical transportation. The coupe and wagon versions offer distinctive styling that stands out from typical Japanese offerings.\n\nCollectors focus on RX-7s and leave these earlier rotaries as affordable alternatives with genuine motorsport heritage.\n\nVolvo built a reputation on safety and practicality, but the 242 GT showed they understood driving dynamics too. This special edition featured unique aerodynamic bodywork, sport suspension, and distinctive alloy wheels.\n\nThe fuel-injected four-cylinder produced around produced about 123 hp in fuel-injected B21E form (outputs varied by market and rating standard) and delivered surprisingly spirited performance. Its handling was sharp for a Volvo, rewarding drivers who pushed it through corners.\n\nWhile 240-series cars are common, finding a genuine GT with its special equipment is increasingly difficult, yet they remain affordable compared to BMW 2002s.\n\nThese twelve overlooked machines from the 1970s prove that collector appeal isn't always about what's most expensive or most famous. Each offers something special, whether it's innovative engineering, quirky charm, or genuine driving pleasure that got overshadowed by flashier contemporaries. The best part about exploring these forgotten gems is that you can actually afford to buy one, drive it, and enjoy it without worrying about depreciation or astronomical restoration costs. As the collector car market continues evolving, smart enthusiasts are discovering that sometimes the most rewarding classics are the ones everyone else walked past.",

    "fullText": "Dec 15 (Reuters) - Ford Motor said on Monday it will take a $19.5 billion writedown and is killing several electric-vehicle models, in the most dramatic example yet of the auto industry's retreat from battery-powered models in response to the Trump administration's policies and ​weakening EV demand.\n\nThe Dearborn, Michigan-based company said it will stop making the F-150 Lightning in its electric vehicle form, but will ‌pivot to producing an extended-range electric model, a version of a hybrid vehicle called an EREV, which uses a gas-powered generator to recharge the battery. The company is also scrapping ‌a next-generation electric truck, codenamed the T3, as well as planned electric commercial vans.\n\nInstead, Ford said it will pivot hard into gas and hybrid models, and eventually hire thousands of workers, even though there will be some layoffs at a jointly owned Tennessee battery plant in the near term. The company expects its global mix of hybrids, extended-range EVs and pure EVs to reach 50% by 2030, from 17% today.\n\nFord will spread out the writedown, taken primarily in ⁠the fourth quarter and continuing through next year ‌and into 2027, the company said. About $8.5 billion is related to cancelling planned EV models. Around $6 billion is tied to the dissolution of a battery joint venture with South Korea’s SK On, and $5 billion on what Ford called “program-related ‍expenses.”\n\nThe automaker also raised its 2025 guidance for adjusted earnings before taxes and interest, to about $7 billion, up from a previous range of $6 billion to $6.5 billion.\n\nFord’s shift reflects the auto industry’s response to waning demand for battery-powered models, after car companies plowed hundreds of billions of dollars into EV investments early this decade. The outlook ​for electrics dimmed significantly this year as U.S. President Donald Trump’s policies yanked federal support for EVs and eased tailpipe-emissions rules, which could ‌encourage carmakers to sell more gas-powered cars.\n\nU.S. sales of electric vehicles fell about 40% in November, following the September 30 expiration of a $7,500 consumer tax credit, which had been in place for more than 15 years to stoke demand. The Trump administration also included in the massive tax and spending bill that passed in July a freeze on fines that automakers pay for violating fuel-economy regulations.\n\n“Rather than spending billions more on large EVs that now have no path to profitability, we are allocating that money into higher-returning areas,” said Andrew Frick, head of Ford’s gas and electric-vehicle operations.",

    "fullText": "Party would also abolish zero-emission vehicle mandate, cutting legal requirement on carmakers to sell EVs\n\nThe Conservatives have announced proposals to end the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars and cut the legal requirement on car manufacturers to sell electric vehicles.\n\nA Conservative government would abolish the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, ending the legal requirement for manufacturers to sell a fixed rising percentage of zero-emission vehicles each year – 80% of new cars and 70% of new vans by 2030, increasing to 100% by 2035. It would also completely end the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars.\n\nA future Conservative government would also scrap all of the non-research and development subsidies associated with the ZEV mandate to “relieve manufacturers of more costly regulatory obligations”, which the party estimates would save £3.8bn over the next decade. Ministers would retain infrastructure funding to continue developing the electric vehicle market.\n\nKemi Badenoch, the leader of the Conservative party, said: “Labour’s rush to net zero is having a disastrous effect on the UK car industry. The Conservatives will ensure that we protect the environment, but we will do so without forcing families to bear the brunt of the costs, and forcing carmakers to meet deadlines that don’t reflect consumer demand.\n\n“By scrapping the ZEV mandate and the ban on petrol cars, we are putting fairness and common sense back into the system and saving money for taxpayers. Britain succeeds when we back business and support innovation – that’s our plan for a stronger economy.”\n\nWriting in the Telegraph, Badenoch said she was inspired by the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and her “commonsense approach to net zero”, which required that “any push to tackle carbon emissions must not degrade Italy’s economy”.\n\nThe previous Conservative government delayed the ban on new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 to 2035 in 2023. However, Labour reinstated the ban and will require every new car to be zero-emission by 2035, on the grounds that the timeline will provide certainty to manufacturers and consumers.\n\nThe ZEV mandate is a result of the Climate Change Act and its 2050 net zero duty, which the Conservatives have pledged to repeal.\n\nDoug Parr, the Greenpeace UK policy director, said: “Nothing the Tories suggest is likely to take effect before 2029, one year from when the ban takes effect. A U-turn now would create chaos after years of preparation for electric cars, wasting effort, risking jobs and leaving Britain stuck in reverse while the rest of the world accelerates towards cleaner, cheaper cars.\n\n“If ever a political party wanted to sow confusion and uncertainty into one of Britain’s most important manufacturing industries, this is how you do it. It’s the opposite of what’s needed to cut pollution, lower running costs for drivers and secure long term jobs.\n\n“Chinese electric vehicles will soon be better and cheaper than anything coming out of Europe or the UK. A phaseout date to incentivise UK manufacturing has to be part of the response. Scrapping rules would be a total disaster. It would undermine investment and leave manufacturers facing uncertainty in a rapidly changing global market. The Tories introduced this policy, and they should leave well alone.”\n\nA government spokesperson said: “We remain committed to phasing out all new non-zero emission car and van sales by 2035. More drivers than ever are choosing electric, and November saw another month of increased sales with EV’s accounting for one in four cars sold.\n\n “We’re investing over £7.5bn to support drivers and manufacturers make the switch to zero emission. This includes £4bn investment to back British manufacturing and R&D, create jobs and drive growth in the sector.”\n\n “Our electric car grant is making it cheaper than ever to choose an EV, with over 40,000 drivers saving up to £3,750 since launch, backed by an extra £1.3bn announced at the autumn budget.”",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS/LONDON/STOCKHOLM, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The European Commission is expected on Tuesday to reverse the EU's effective ban on sales of new combustion-engine cars from 2035, bowing to intense pressure from Germany, Italy and European automakers struggling against Chinese and U.S. rivals.\n\nThe move, the details of which are ​still being hashed out by EU officials ahead of its unveiling, could see the effective ban pushed back by five years or softened indefinitely, official ‌and industry sources said.\n\nThe likely revision to the 2023 law requiring all new cars and vans sold in the 27-nation bloc from 2035 to be CO2 emission-free would be the European Union's most significant climb-down from its ‌green policies of the past five years.\n\n\"The European Commission will be putting forward a clear proposal to abolish the ban on combustion engines,\" Manfred Weber, head of the European Parliament's largest group, the European People's Party, said on Friday. \"It was a serious industrial policy mistake.\"\n\nReneging on the ban has divided the sector. Traditional automakers like Volkswagen and Fiat-owner Stellantis have pushed hard for targets to be eased amid fierce competition from lower-cost Chinese rivals. The EV sector, however, sees it as yielding more ground to China in the electrification ⁠shift.\n\n\"The technology is ready, charging infrastructure is ready, and consumers ‌are ready,\" said EV maker Polestar's CEO Michael Lohscheller. \"So what are we waiting for?\"\n\nCOMBUSTION ENGINES AROUND FOR 'REST OF CENTURY'\n\nThe 2023 law was designed to accelerate a transition from combustion engines to batteries or fuel cells and fine automakers who failed to meet the targets.\n\nMeeting the ‍targets means selling more electric vehicles, where European carmakers lag Tesla and Chinese producers like BYD and Geely.\n\nEurope's carmakers are making EVs, but say demand has lagged expectations as consumers are reluctant to buy more expensive EVs and charging infrastructure is insufficient. EU tariffs on Chinese-built EVs have only slightly eased the pressure.\n\n\"It's not a sustainable reality today in Europe,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley ​told reporters in France last week, announcing a partnership with Renault to help cut EV costs. Industry needs were \"not well balanced\" with EU CO2 targets, he said.\n\nThe ‌EU granted the sector \"breathing space\" in March, allowing automakers to comply with 2025 targets over three years.\n\nBut automakers want to continue selling combustion-engine models alongside plug-in hybrids, range extender EVs with 'CO2-neutral' fuels - including biofuels made from agricultural residues and waste such as used cooking oil.",

The vessel, known as Puffer Fish Blue 01, developed by China's Wuhu Shipyard and Sandianshui New Energy Technology, had been certified by the China Classification Society, a professional body for ship classification, it added.\n\n\"Their investment and efforts to build pure electric container vessels show China's increasing influence in the global shipbuilding industry,\" said Xiong Hao, assistant general ­manager at Shanghai Jump International Shipping. \"It remains to be seen whether electric vessels will be widely accepted by global container liners.\"\n\nPeople visit a model of a nuclear-powered container ship at Marintec China 2025 in Shanghai on December 2, 2025.

    "fullText": "Ever wonder which brand-new cars are gathering dust on dealer lots across America? iSeeCars did a deep dive into more than 2.6 million new car listings across the United States, revealing some surprising answers.\n\nThe data shows the percentage of 2024 inventory still sitting unsold, and the results paint an interesting picture of what today's buyers are actually looking for. From luxury SUVs to sports cars, these twelve models are having a tougher time finding homes than dealers probably anticipated.\n\nSome of the names might surprise you, while others make perfect sense once you consider pricing, timing, and market trends.\n\nLeading the pack with a staggering 82% of inventory still available, the Dodge Hornet plug-in hybrid is struggling to find its audience. This compact crossover arrived with plenty of expectations, bringing electrification to the Dodge lineup in an unexpected package.\n\nThe pricing sits in an awkward middle ground where buyers shopping for practicality might opt for less expensive options, while performance enthusiasts may not see the Hornet as a true Dodge muscle vehicle. The plug-in hybrid powertrain adds complexity and cost that many shoppers in this segment simply aren't asking for.\n\nIt's a challenging market position when your brand identity is built on roaring V8s and quarter-mile times.\n\nThe Grand Cherokee has long been a cornerstone of Jeep's lineup, but more than 70% of 2024 models remain unsold at an average price above $64,000. That price point puts it in direct competition with luxury European SUVs that offer prestigious badges and refined experiences.\n\nThe midsize SUV market is fiercely competitive, especially at this price point where buyers have dozens of well-established two-row luxury and near-luxury options to choose from. Jeep's recent quality perception issues haven't helped matters, as buyers spending this much want assurance their investment will be reliable.\n\nThe Grand Cherokee remains capable and spacious, but convincing buyers to choose it over established luxury competitors at this price requires a compelling value proposition.\n\nAlfa Romeo's entry into the compact luxury crossover segment has met a lukewarm reception, with nearly half of the 2024 Tonale Hybrid inventory still available. The Italian brand brings undeniable style and driving dynamics, but the hybrid powertrain in a segment where buyers often prioritize either pure efficiency or pure performance creates an identity challenge.\n\nAt almost $52,000, shoppers have access to well-established German competitors with stronger dealer networks and better resale values. The Tonale looks fantastic and drives with characteristic Alfa flair, but breaking into the American market with limited brand presence remains an uphill battle.\n\nEnthusiasts love what Alfa Romeo represents, though convincing mainstream luxury buyers to take the leap is another story entirely.\n\nThe Malibu's struggles reflect a broader trend: the American sedan is facing an existential crisis. With 31% of inventory unsold, this dependable midsize sedan is caught in a market that has decisively shifted toward SUVs and crossovers.\n\nChevrolet has already announced the Malibu's discontinuation, which certainly doesn't help sales as buyers tend to avoid models they know are being phased out. The pricing is reasonable and the Malibu offers solid value with good fuel economy and a comfortable ride.\n\nHowever, when most buyers can get into a Chevy Trax or Trailblazer for similar money with the added versatility of a crossover, the traditional sedan becomes a tougher sell.\n\nThe non-hybrid Dodge Hornet appears again, this time the base model with 26% of inventory still on lots. At nearly $32,000, this Alfa Romeo Tonale-based crossover faces an identity crisis within the Dodge lineup.\n\nTraditional Dodge buyers expect American muscle and V8 rumble, not a turbocharged four-cylinder Italian-rooted crossover. The Hornet offers decent performance and modern features, but it doesn't fit the brand's muscle car image that draws customers to showrooms. Meanwhile, buyers simply looking for a compact crossover have dozens of more established options to choose from.\n\nDodge is attempting to pivot toward a more diverse lineup, though this transition is proving challenging when your brand loyalty is built on a very specific type of vehicle.\n\nWhen your average transaction price approaches six figures, you're competing with some serious luxury iron. The Grand Wagoneer L stretches the already-large Grand Wagoneer even further, creating a true land yacht for families who need maximum space.\n\nAt over $92,000, buyers at this level expect Range Rover levels of refinement and prestige, which represents a significant leap for the Jeep brand. The Grand Wagoneer L offers impressive capability and generous three-row seating, but the price tag puts it in rarefied air where badge perception matters enormously.\n\nJeep has made tremendous strides in luxury execution, yet convincing ultra-luxury buyers to choose a Jeep over established European competitors remains a formidable challenge.\n\nGenesis continues working to establish itself in the American luxury market, and the electric GV60 crossover exemplifies both the brand's potential and its challenges. With nearly 22% of inventory unsold, this stylish EV offers distinctive design and impressive technology at a price point below comparable European EVs.\n\nThe challenge is brand awareness and dealer network size, as Genesis simply doesn't have the visibility or accessibility of established luxury brands. The GV60 delivers genuine luxury and engaging driving dynamics in an eye-catching package.\n\nHowever, when spending nearly $58,000 on an electric vehicle, many buyers gravitate toward Tesla's established Supercharger network or prestigious German alternatives with decades of luxury credibility.\n\nThe legendary Charger's presence on this list might seem surprising given its cult following, but at nearly $60,000 average price, we're looking at well-equipped or performance variants. The Charger has enjoyed an incredible run as one of the last V8-powered sedan options, yet the transition to electric power looms on the horizon.\n\nBuyers interested in the traditional Charger experience may be waiting for deals as inventory clears, while those interested in the upcoming electric version are simply waiting for its arrival. The pricing also reflects how expensive these muscle sedans have become, potentially pricing out some traditional buyers.\n\nThe Charger remains an automotive icon, though this transitional moment creates uncertainty in the marketplace.\n\nThe reborn Z sports car brought tremendous excitement when it launched, combining retro-inspired styling with modern performance. However, with nearly 19% of inventory unsold at an average price above $53,000, the market reality for two-seater sports cars is challenging.\n\nThis price point puts the Z in competition with the Toyota Supra, Chevrolet Corvette, and various European sports cars that offer different flavors of performance. The Z delivers fantastic driving dynamics and that classic long-hood proportions that enthusiasts love, but sports car sales volumes are inherently limited.\n\nAdditionally, the automatic-only NISMO trim disappointed some purists, even though manual transmissions remain available on other Z trims.\n\nThe Wrangler 4xe brings electrification to Jeep's most iconic nameplate, yet 18% of inventory remains unsold at an eye-watering average of nearly $61,000. This price reflects the technology premium for the plug-in hybrid system, pushing the Wrangler into luxury vehicle territory.\n\nTraditional Wrangler buyers often prioritize simplicity and proven off-road capability, while the added complexity of a PHEV system may not align with how they use their vehicles. The 4xe actually offers impressive off-road benefits with instant electric torque and silent running capability, plus daily driving efficiency that traditional Wranglers can't match.\n\nHowever, convincing buyers to spend this much on a Wrangler requires demonstrating clear advantages over the less expensive conventional powertrains.\n\nHyundai's electrified Tucson represents a logical evolution of the popular compact crossover, though 14% of PHEV inventory remains available. At over $45,000, the plug-in hybrid commands a significant premium over the regular Tucson, which already offers excellent value and features.\n\nBuyers interested in electrification at this price point have numerous options, including fully electric vehicles that eliminate gas stations entirely. The Tucson PHEV makes sense for drivers who want electric-only commuting capability with gas backup for longer trips, though that specific use case represents a smaller slice of the market.\n\nHyundai's rapid advancement in quality and technology is impressive, yet the price premium for plug-in capability remains a hurdle for value-conscious crossover shoppers.\n\nThe standard-length Grand Wagoneer rounds out our list with 13% of inventory unsold at an average price approaching $84,000. Jeep's flagship SUV aims to reclaim the brand's heritage of premium American utility vehicles with genuine luxury appointments.\n\nThe execution is impressive with high-quality materials, advanced technology, and commanding road presence that makes a statement. Yet at this price, buyers comparison shop against well-established luxury SUVs from brands with long histories of premium vehicle production.\n\nThe Grand Wagoneer succeeds in offering Jeep capability with upscale execution, though breaking into the established luxury SUV market requires time for brand perception to catch up with product reality.\n\nThis inventory analysis reveals some clear patterns about today's automotive market. Plug-in hybrids face an uphill battle as buyers increasingly choose either conventional powertrains or fully electric vehicles, skipping the middle ground entirely.\n\nPremium pricing pushes vehicles into competitive territory where brand perception and established luxury credentials matter enormously. The data also shows that even beloved nameplates like the Wrangler and Charger face sales challenges when configurations push prices into unexpected territory.\n\nThese inventory levels don't necessarily indicate bad vehicles, but rather misalignments between product offerings, pricing, and what buyers are actually seeking in today's market.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — Chinese demand for foreign luxury cars is waning as customers opt for more affordable Chinese brand models, often sold at big discounts, catering to their taste for fancy electronics and comfort.\n\nThat is bad news for European carmakers like Porsche, Aston Martin, Mercedes-Benz and BMW that have long dominated the upper reaches of the world's largest auto market.\n\nA slowing economy hits the luxury market\n\nA prolonged property downturn in China has left many consumers with little appetite for big purchases. Meanwhile, the well-to-do are becoming increasingly shy about publicly displaying their wealth, said Paul Gong, UBS head of China Automotive Industry Research.\n\nMany car buyers have been swayed by a 20,000 yuan ($2,830) trade-in subsidy offered by the Chinese government for purchasing electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. People tended to purchase cheaper, entry-level cars where the discount will count more and those cars are mostly Chinese made, Gong said.\n\n“Slowing economic growth is one key driver behind weaker demand for premium cars,” said Claire Yuan, director of corporate ratings for China autos at S&P Global Ratings, referring to a segment that typically counts car brands such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW.\n\nThe market share of premium car sales in China, usually priced above 300,000 yuan ($42,400), more than doubled between 2017 and 2023 to about 15% of total sales, S&P said.\n\nThat trend is now reversing. The share of premium cars sales fell to 14% in 2024 and to 13% in the first nine months of 2025, S&P said.\n\nChinese automakers take a bigger bite\n\nWhile luxury auto sales have slowed, Chinese manufacturers, including electric vehicle maker BYD, have become more aggressive than many Western brands in technological innovation, frequently rolling out new electric vehicles and hybrids at cheaper prices, including premium vehicles, analysts said.\n\n“Their (Chinese carmakers’) products are more competitive and more affordable even in the premium segment,” Yuan said. “That’s why these foreign brands are gradually losing momentum.”\n\nThe Chinese brands’ share of passenger car sales climbed to almost 70% in the first 11 months of this year, according to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. It reported Thursday that German brands held a 12% share, Japanese brands around 10% and U.S. brands nearly 6%.\n\nBYD already has overtaken Volkswagen as the biggest car seller in China in recent years. BYD is so far the best selling car brand this year in China for “new energy vehicles,” which include electric vehicles and hybrids, according to the China Passenger Car Association. BYD had cut prices of its electric and plug-in hybrid models by up to 34%, putting pressure on major rivals like Geely and Leapmotor.",

    "description": "Rivian executives said AI and autonomy not only makes sense for their company, but also reflects the direction of the entire auto industry.",
    "fullText": "If there were a Venn diagram of a driver who wants an adventure-focused car with off-roading capability on one side and a driver who wants a software-centric, computer-first car that could drive itself on the other, would there be a lot of overlap between the two circles?\n\nOn Thursday, Rivian hosted an \"Autonomy & AI Day\" at the company's research and development hub in Palo Alto, where hundreds witnessed the EV maker's grand leap into the future: a highly integrated AI assistant and fully autonomous driving capability, all powered by Rivian's very own silicon chip.\n\nWassym Bensaid, Rivian's Chief Software Officer, called the move a \"profound platform shift which changes our product and everything we do at the company.\"\n\nBensaid is among the key executives leading the charge toward Rivian's \"AI-defined vehicle,\" along with James Philbin, VP of Autonomy & AI, and Vidya Rajagopalan, Senior VP of Rivian's electrical hardware division.\n\nDuring the event, I had the chance to talk to Bensaid and Philbin about the pivot and whether it makes sense for a company that, since its inception, has branded itself as an adventure-forward vehicle, or if this is just a response to consumer demand.\n\nPhilbin, who was a director at Zoox and Waymo before joining Rivian in 2022, told me that pursuing autonomy has long been part of the company's trajectory rather than an overnight decision.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, Philbin sees a rising \"tide\" in consumer demand for some level of autonomy — especially as robotaxis become mainstream.\n\n\"We are starting to see that autonomy is a really important purchase decision with customers, and especially customers who come from vehicles with maybe high levels of autonomy,\" he said. \"They don't go back.\"\n\nPhilbin said that having a high-level advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) was cited as one of the \"top three purchase reasons\" for Rivian customers. However, the demand will extend to all automakers, he said.\n\n\"I just see it becoming such a key purchase driver for vehicles going forward,\" Philbin said. \"And I think every OEM will have to deliver these features to customers in some way.\"\n\nA year ago, Bensaid told me that the future of cars would be hands-free, and that using buttons or fiddling with the touchscreen would be \"an anomaly.\"\n\n\"It's a bug, it's not a feature,\" he said at the time. \"Ideally, you would want to interact with your car through voice. And the problem today is that most voice assistants are just broken.\"\n\nThursday's demonstration of the Rivian Assistant, an in-car AI assistant that can control certain vehicle functions, brought Bensaid's vision to life. I saw the Rivian Assistant pull up navigation directions and control the direction of the air vents through voice control.\n\nBensaid told me at the event that \"cars and automotive are probably the killer app for AI.\"\n\n\"In your 30-minute or 45-minute commute every day, you want to get your time back, you want to really take control of your time,\" he said.\n\nWhen I asked the software chief where the overlap was between Rivian's adventure brand and its AI push, Bensaid said the company \"inspires many types of customers.\"\n\n\"I think at the core of the brand, Rivian wants people to explore the world,\" he said, and that there were different ways to do so, whether that's by going off-road or exploring the world through technology.\n\nAt the same time, Bensaid said, \"At heart, we are a technology company, so technology is really a big part of the user experience, how we see ourselves, and how we present ourselves to the world.\"\n\nBensaid's statement touches upon another key focus beyond the automaker's line-up of premium trucks and SUVs: software licensing.\n\nRivian's joint venture with the German automotive giant Volkswagen was a clear sign of its intent to license its software platform to other automakers in the future.\n\nPart of the tech will include self-driving capabilities, which the entire automotive world — legacy and startup — is exploring, Steve Man, senior auto analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, told me.\n\n\"We don't really know at the end of the day if there's going to be a huge mass adoption,\" Man said of autonomy. Still, the analyst adds that \"it's a must\" for car makers to pursue.\n\nSales of Tesla's Full Self-Driving Supervised reflect that uncertainty. CEO Elon Musk has presented FSD as the key driver of the company's valuation even though the adoption rate of FSD remains at around 12%, Vaibhav Taneja, Tesla's Chief Financial Officer, said in October.\n\nThe automotive industry still remains bullish on autonomy and AI.\n\nNissan partnered with UK-based Wayve, which develops software for advanced driver assistance systems. General Motors teased plans for an eyes-off driving system for 2028. And Mercedes unveiled a hands-off, eyes-off ADAS a few years ago.\n\nA recent Bloomberg Intelligence report said that nearly half of C-suite auto executives surveyed said they expect AI to lift sales and profits by 9% over the next two to three years.\n\n\"From a business perspective, you don't know if it is going to take off, but you need to invest some money now so that you're not behind,\" Man said, \"and you have the opportunity to roll it out if it is something that people want.\"",

    "fullText": "The automotive world has given us incredible engineering feats, iconic designs, and moments that changed transportation forever. But alongside these achievements are puzzles that have captivated enthusiasts for decades.\n\nFrom legendary prototypes that vanished without a trace to engineering decisions that still spark heated debates, these mysteries remind us that car history isn't always written in stone.\n\nSome questions may never have definitive answers, and honestly, that's part of what makes them so fascinating to discuss over a wrench and a cold drink in the garage. The following mysteries have different endings: while some have a pretty possible answer, others still have us scratching our heads.\n\nSteve McQueen's 1968 Highland Green Mustang GT from Bullitt became one of the most famous movie cars ever, but for decades, nobody knew where it was. Two identical Mustangs were used for filming, and while one was long believed to have met its end as a battered camera car, the hero car seemingly disappeared into thin air.\n\nThe automotive community spent years hunting for it, with rumors placing it everywhere from Mexico to a Kentucky junkyard. Then in 2018, it reappeared at the Detroit Auto Show, having been quietly owned by the same family since 1974.\n\nThe owner had kept it largely original, complete with movie modifications and that iconic roar, proving that sometimes the best hiding place is simply staying quiet.\n\nPreston Tucker’s 1948 Tucker ’48 Sedan was genuinely ahead of its time, featuring a rear-mounted engine, four-wheel independent suspension, and innovative safety features that Detroit wouldn’t adopt for decades. Tucker had originally promoted disc brakes and fuel injection, but those ideas were dropped before production.\n\nBut his ambitious venture collapsed amid controversy, SEC investigations, and allegations that were later dismissed in court. While Tucker was acquitted of all fraud charges, his company was already finished, leaving only 51 cars ever produced.\n\nWhether it was a case of an innovator crushed by established industry forces or a business that simply overreached remains one of automotive history's great debates.\n\nEveryone knows the 1966 Batmobile was built from a Lincoln Futura concept car by legendary customizer George Barris, but the question of what engine actually propelled it has caused decades of confusion. The Lincoln Futura originally had a 368-cubic-inch Lincoln V8, but various sources have claimed everything from keeping the original engine to swapping in a 390 or even a 429.\n\nBarris himself gave different answers over the years, and the car underwent modifications throughout its life. Three additional Batmobiles were built for promotional tours, each potentially configured differently, further muddying the waters.\n\nFor a car that's supposed to represent cutting-edge crime-fighting technology, its actual mechanical specifications remain surprisingly mysterious.\n\nGeneral Motors' EV1, launched in 1996, was the first mass-produced electric vehicle of the modern era and developed a passionate following among its lessees. When GM abruptly canceled the program in 2003, they made the controversial decision to reclaim and crush nearly every single vehicle, despite protests from drivers who wanted to purchase them.\n\nThe company cited parts, liability, and lack of profitability as reasons, but the dramatic destruction of a functioning, beloved product seemed extreme to many. Only about 40 EV1s survived, most of them deactivated and donated to museums and universities with their powertrains disabled so they couldn’t be legally driven on public roads, although a tiny handful have been kept or made operational again under very controlled circumstances.\n\nThe whole saga spawned documentaries and conspiracy theories, making the EV1's fate one of the strangest chapters in automotive history.\n\nThere's a popular story that Enzo Ferrari viewed road car production as merely a necessary evil to finance his true passion of racing. The famous quote attributed to him suggests he built and sold road cars only because he couldn't fund his racing operation any other way.\n\nWhile this makes for a compelling narrative that certainly captures Ferrari's racing-first mentality, historians debate whether it oversimplifies a more complex business reality. Ferrari clearly prioritized racing above all else, but the company's business model required both sides to function.\n\nWhether Enzo truly saw customers as merely checkbooks for his racing dreams or understood the symbiotic relationship between the two remains open to interpretation, though his legendary indifference to customer complaints certainly supports the popular version.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Chrysler built 55 stunning turbine-powered cars and loaned them to regular families across America for real-world testing. These weren't just concepts, they were fully functional vehicles with bronze metallic paint, rotating turbine-inspired taillights, and jet engines that could run on almost anything from diesel to perfume.\n\nThe program ran from 1963 to 1966, and the cars performed surprisingly well, but Chrysler ultimately decided not to pursue production. Here's where it gets weird: of the 55 cars built, Chrysler destroyed 46 of them, mainly to avoid long-term liability and support problems with such a unique fleet in private hands (the often-repeated ‘import duties on the Italian bodies’ explanation is only part of the story), leaving just nine survivors.\n\nThose nine survivors are scattered among museums, with a few in private collections, representing one of the boldest experiments that almost changed automotive history but didn't.\n\nMazda's unwavering commitment to the rotary engine, even when it nearly bankrupted the company multiple times, remains one of automotive history's most puzzling strategic decisions. The Wankel rotary engine offered a smoother, more compact alternative to piston engines, and Mazda licensed the technology in the 1960s with genuine enthusiasm.\n\nDespite chronic issues with fuel economy, oil consumption, and emissions regulations, Mazda kept developing rotaries for decades, culminating in the legendary RX-7 and RX-8. The company invested massive resources into an engine design that most manufacturers had already abandoned as impractical.\n\nWhile enthusiasts celebrate Mazda's dedication to uniqueness and the rotary's undeniable character, it's still unclear whether this was visionary persistence or stubborn defiance of market reality.\n\nJohn DeLorean's stainless steel sports car dream became reality with substantial backing from the British government, which invested over $120 million in a factory in Northern Ireland. The deal seemed too good to be true for an unproven car company, and it was: the project collapsed amid allegations of drug trafficking in a controversial FBI sting operation.\n\nDeLorean was eventually acquitted on grounds of entrapment, but by then, the company was finished after producing only about 9,000 cars. Questions remain about the financial arrangements, government motivations, and whether the whole venture was viable from the start.\n\nThe DeLorean story has everything: innovation, government intrigue, legal drama, and ultimately, immortality through Back to the Future.\n\nMost people credit Pontiac's 1964 GTO as the first muscle car, creating the formula of stuffing a big engine into a midsize body. But Studebaker enthusiasts will quickly point out that the 1963 Avanti R3 and the 1963-64 Lark Daytona with the R2 supercharged engine came first, offering serious performance in relatively affordable packages.\n\nStudebaker was installing high-performance V8s in compact bodies before Pontiac made it famous. The debate comes down to definitions: was it about the specific formula, the marketing approach, or the cultural impact? Studebaker certainly had the hardware first, but Pontiac created the phenomenon.\n\nWhether this makes Studebaker the forgotten originator or simply an earlier experiment depends on how you define the category itself.\n\nIt's estimated that hundreds of thousands of cars were built between 1900 and 1915, yet remarkably few survive today compared to later eras. These early automobiles, often called \"brass-era\" cars for their prominent brass fixtures, have survival rates that seem impossibly low given the sheer numbers produced.\n\nMany were simply worn out and scrapped, but that doesn't fully explain where they all went. The materials were valuable during wartime scrap drives, they were considered worthless old junk long before anyone thought to preserve them, and many likely decayed in barns and fields before anyone recognized their historical value.\n\nThe few survivors command enormous prices today, making you wonder how many treasures are still hiding in forgotten corners waiting to be discovered.\n\nThe 427 Shelby Cobra has legendary performance figures that seem to vary depending on who's telling the story and which magazine you're reading. While we know the top speed, published 0-60 times range from 3.5 to 4.5 seconds, and quarter-mile times are similarly inconsistent.\n\nThe problem is that these weren't factory cars with standardized specifications; they were essentially hand-built race cars with street registration, each potentially different. Testing conditions varied wildly, some cars had race modifications, and Carroll Shelby himself was known for optimistic claims. Modern recreations and continuation cars add to the confusion by posting different numbers with modern tires and tuning.\n\nFor a car that's supposed to represent pure, raw American performance, we still can't quite pin down exactly how raw it really was.\n\nThe Pontiac Fiero suffered from one of the strangest reputation spirals in automotive history, earning a “fire hazard” label that stuck far harder than the underlying facts.\n\nEarly 1984 Fieros did experience a higher-than-normal rate of engine fires, largely due to a connecting-rod failure in the 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine. But contrary to the common retelling, GM didn’t solve the problem overnight—the company didn’t issue a full recall until late 1987, after several years of incidents and negative publicity. By that time, the damage to the Fiero’s image was irreversible. Ironically, once the mechanical issues were addressed, later Fieros had fire incident rates much closer to other cars of the era.\n\nAnd when Pontiac finally perfected the formula with the vastly improved 1988 suspension and upgraded powertrains, the car was already living under a cloud it couldn’t escape. The Fiero remains a case study in how early flaws—and delayed corporate responses—can overshadow genuine engineering progress.\n\nThese automotive mysteries remind us that history isn't always as clear-cut as we'd like it to be. Some puzzles stem from lost documentation, others from deliberate secrecy, and still others from the simple fact that people remember things differently over time.\n\nWhat makes these stories fascinating isn't necessarily finding definitive answers, but the conversations they spark and the detective work they inspire. The next time you're at a car show or scrolling through auction listings, remember that automotive history is still being written and rewritten.\n\nWho knows what forgotten prototype might be gathering dust in someone's garage, or what long-held belief might be overturned by newly discovered documents tomorrow.",

    "description": "\"I think instead of doing DOGE, I would have basically worked on my companies.\"",
    "fullText": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk is known in part for saying controversial or \"careless\" things, but as the Guardian reported, he recently made a sincerely shocking admission.\n\nOn Dec. 9, Musk appeared on a podcast hosted by Katie Miller, the wife of deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller. During that appearance, the Tesla CEO made a highly unusual set of statements, describing the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which was previously run by him, as only \"a little bit successful.\" Miller asked Musk if he would do it all again, and he said he wouldn't.\n\n\"I think instead of doing DOGE, I would have basically worked on my companies. And they wouldn't have been burning the cars,\" Musk said, referencing Tesla vandalism.\n\nIn 2025, Musk's involvement in American politics moved beyond funding and into an active government role.\n\nMusk first floated the idea of a \"government efficiency\" division in August 2024, and on Jan. 20, the concept formally became the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\n\nWhat followed was, by all accounts, an immediate frenzy of government cuts. Staffed by individuals as young as 19, none older than 25, DOGE was likened to a \"wrecking ball.\"\n\nWithin a week, more than two million federal civil servants received an email pressuring them to resign from their positions and transition \"to higher productivity jobs in the private sector.\"\n\nMusk repeatedly pledged to cut $1 trillion worth of what he insisted was \"waste, fraud, and abuse\" in Washington, despite scant evidence of the purported problem. One of DOGE's first high-profile actions was to decommission USAID, a humanitarian aid agency.\n\nDOGE \"spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper. Could gone to some great parties. Did that instead,\" Musk posted to X on Feb. 3.\n\nBacklash was swift as food aid was incinerated rather than distributed, and in the spring, Microsoft founder Bill Gates characterized DOGE's targeting of USAID as \"the world's richest man killing the world's poorest children.\"\n\nWould you buy an EV if it only took you five minutes to charge?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nVital funds appropriated by Congress were frozen, in-progress projects were canceled, and DOGE's activity at the Social Security Administration affected disbursements and potentially compromised Americans' data.\n\nAs scenes of chaos unfolded, Musk emphasized his public-facing role, even as critical agencies like the National Weather Service had their funding slashed. Backlash was swift and not limited to the United States.\n\nMusk's role as CEO of Tesla was equally prominent, and the electric vehicle manufacturer's dealerships were protested, with cars and charging stations vandalized.\n\nSales slumped immediately in the U.S. and Europe, and a subsequent NBER study quantified the enormous economic impact Musk's actions inflicted on the Tesla brand.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "A virtual horizon on your phone can reduce inner ear conflict.",
    "fullText": "I get really carsick if I try to read in a moving vehicle. And there's a reason for that: my eyes and my sense of movement are out of sync.\n\nAt least, that's according to the CDC, which states that motion sickness, \"happens when the movement you see is different from what your inner ear senses.\" Your inner ear is a sack of fluid that moves when you do, giving you an innate sense of movement. If you're in a car and watching the horizon, your senses are aligned. But if you're looking at your phone, your senses are confusing each other. It's similar to the reason VR games make some people feel sick.\n\nThe free Android app KineStop aims to help. The application overlays a transparent horizon, and a number of transparent dots, across your entire screen. The accelerometer on your phone is used to move these reference points as your phone moves, helping to reduce the conflict between your eyes and your inner ear. You can turn the feature on manually in the application or, if you prefer, you can set it up to turn on automatically when you're in a moving car.\n\nI tried it out, wondering if it would help with my carsickness, and it did—surprisingly well. Normally I can't read for more than a few minutes without feeling sick, but the KineStop app helped me do so for longer, without discomfort. I'm still not going to be able to read novels during a long road trip, mind you, but I can look up the next restaurant on a road trip without vomiting, and I call that a win.\n\nKineStop is totally free, though there's a $3.50 pro version that adds themed overlays, including one that makes it look like your phone is a half-empty beer. It's great to support a developer, but I also think the free version will work fine for most everyone.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 11 - Major automakers on Thursday urged Washington to prevent Chinese government-backed automakers and battery manufacturers from opening U.S. ​manufacturing plants, warning the industry's future is at stake.\n\nThe Alliance for Automotive ‌Innovation, which represents General Motors, Ford, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen, Hyundai, Stellantis and other major automakers, sounded the ‌alarm and said Congress and the Trump administration needed to act.\n\n\"China poses a clear and present threat to the auto industry in the U.S.,\" the group wrote in a statement for a U.S. House hearing on Chinese vehicles. The group also said ⁠lawmakers should maintain the U.S. ‌Commerce Department's prohibition on importing information and communications technology and services from China that effectively bars the import of vehicles from ‍Chinese manufacturers.\n\n\"No amount of investment by automakers and battery manufacturers operating inside the U.S. can counter a China that is enabled by subsidies to chronically oversupply around the world. This is ​a recipe for dumping that Congress and the Trump Administration must prevent ‌from happening inside the U.S.,\" the auto industry group said.\n\nRepresentative John Moolenaar, a Republican who chairs a select House committee on China, said Congress should codify into law the prohibitions on Chinese-connected vehicles that were adopted in the final days of former President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"In just five years, China has gone from a minor ⁠exporter to the world's largest auto exporter, shipping ​6 million vehicles abroad last year at below ​market prices that U.S. and allied automakers cannot match,\" Moolenaar said. \"With massive subsidies, control over raw materials and supply chains and a ‍predatory regulatory regime, Beijing ⁠has turned its auto industry into a tool of the state.\n\nHe also cited national security concerns about Chinese-imported vehicles and concerns that Beijing could ⁠disable vehicles with Chinese-made software or components in the event of a major confrontation.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in ‌Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "Buying a car that's reliable will save you from serious headaches later on. According to Consumer Reports, this is one of the most reliable luxury vehicles.",
    "fullText": "The Lexus NX was listed by Consumer Reports as one of the ten most reliable vehicles. According to the CR report, published in December 2024, the 2025-year model got a score of 78 out of a possible 100 in the reliability category, placing it in seventh place. That might sound a tad underwhelming, especially when you consider the fact that the 2024 Lexus NX model received a score of 95 in terms of reliability while the 2021 model received a score of 94. Keep in mind, these are outliers. The 2023 model rated a worrisome 58, down from 2022's Lexus NX which had a reliability score of 66.\n\nThat being said, the Lexus NX has generally achieved solid reliability scores from CR (over 70, apart from '22 and '23) since it first debuted in 2015 which shouldn't be too surprising since its part of the Lexus brand. In 2025, Lexus ranked the highest in terms of vehicle dependability for the third year in a row, according to J.D. Power. Whereas the average vehicle in that survey experienced 202 problems per 100 vehicles over the course of three years, the Lexus vehicles had just 104 problems per 100 vehicles.\n\nBest of all, while the Lexus NX is a luxury SUV it isn't all that expensive compared to other luxury brands. The car sells at an average of $50,896, which is slightly below the average price for a new vehicle of any kind ($50,080) in September 2025. The average price for a luxury compact SUV, as of March 2025, was $52,933.\n\nOn average, the Lexus NX costs $7,712 in maintenance costs for its first 10 years of service. That's $4,741 less than the average luxury SUV model. Also: There is only a 21.14% chance the Lexus NX will need a huge fix within those ten years. That beats other luxury SUVs by 17.37%. Such low car shop rates would appear to be a testimony to the Lexus NX's overall reliability, but again some model years are better than others.\n\nThere were also some recalls implemented by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for issues that included a back over prevention rearview camera that didn't work (model years 2022-2025), a deactivated airbag at the steering column (2023 and 2024), a head restraint on the driver's and passenger's side that could be accidentally removed (2023 and 2024), a defective second-row center seatbelt (2025), and a parking service brake that won't engage while in park (2022). There was also an electrical issue with some Lexus NX450 hybrid electric vehicles that sometimes caused them to overheat while recharging in temperatures below 41 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nRecall issues are supposed to be fixed by dealers free of charge. Assuming you can verify that those issues were taken care of, acquiring a preowned Lexus NX might not be a bad idea if you're trying to decide whether to buy new or used. You can save an average of $17,900 acquiring a reliable Lexus NX that is two years old while maintaining confidence it still has years of use ahead of it.\n\nOn the flip side, a Lexus NX may not be as good a used car investment as the Lexus RX 350 because the Lexus NX loses 47% of its value after five years while a Lexus RX 350 depreciates just 35% in that time. The Lexus NX depreciation rate is also higher than that of the overall Lexus brand, which averages at 38.3% over five years.\n\nIt's no secret that new cars depreciate quickly after you buy them, but among luxury car brands Lexus is the very best when it comes to its ability to retain resale value. A new vehicle usually depreciates 55% over five years, so the Lexus NX's 47% depreciation rate is still above average — unlike the popular Jeep Wagoneer, which has terrible resale value.\n\nUnlock your financial potential.

    "description": "If your car ended up on this list, I think it would be best if you headed down to the comments and explained yourself.",
    "fullText": "We all know cars are quite expensive right now. The average new car will now set you back over $50,000, which isn't ideal for anyone. That means there are plenty of terrible car values out there, and that idea is what led me to the question I asked you all last week.\n\nI wanted to know which car on sale today is the worst value. What car provides so little for the money it costs that you cannot wrap your head around why anyone could possibly buy one? How was a dealer salesman so slimy or good at his job that they were able to convince someone to buy that piece of crap?\n\nI know. It's mind-boggling. But in any case, I'll stop yapping. How about you all drop down below and check out what new cars your fellow Jalops consider to be the worst values out there. If your car ended up on this list, I think it would be best if you headed down to the comments and explained yourself.\n\nA car of many flaws, but the biggest one is the existence of X5 M - same performance, better comfort, better looks, half the price.\n\nIt's a $70K + EV with inferior performance to EVs that cost $20k less. You're just paying a massive premium for nostalgia and getting nothing in terms of range and performance, not to mention it's often said that the interior materials are industrial at best.\n\nCybertruck of course. 6 figure purchase price, gets out performed by vehicles half the cost. Worse, you can't sell it or trade it in without giving it away... nobody wants a used Cybertruck. Buy F150, Ram 1500, Chevy Silverado, and they will do more for much less and have a much better resale value.\n\nPut down the pitchforks and hear me out...\n\nThe base Porsche 911 now starts at $134,650 (including destination) before options for the 992.2 generation (let's just ignore the ADMs and allocation games that dealers are playing). Yes, that gets you legendary sports car with sublime handling and Porsche build quality, but it also only nets you 388 hp and a basic interior that wouldn't look out of place in a mid-trim level Mazda. Start adding options and you can very quickly approach $200k. Porsche has gone bonkers with its pricing the last few years, especially on the 911. It's a great car, but at that price it's just not a great value anymore.\n\nYes I'm still bitter about the price and power level. Really would have liked one for a daily driver. Toyota needs to step up and make a GR Prius.\n\nThe Ineos Grenadier. 80k+ for a Land Rover knock off. If you're going to spend that much, just get a Land Rover Classic. About the same cost, but at least it's a real land rover.\n\nThe current AMG GT 2 door - yes, the car I adore, is...not the worst value per se, but definitely over priced for sure, however the worst value for the money in that model has to be the GT43. Also why they made the GT into a 4 door car with the same name is also stupid, so now I have to specify which variant I want, which is annoying.\n\nBut why on Earth is there a 4 banger version for the 2 door? And why on Europa, does it start at $106K? Are you dumb!? It has the same 0-60 as a stock Evo X MR that costed less than half it's price. It's the same thing that happened with the C63, only thank the lord Mercedes wasn't dumb enough to put that drivetrain in the GT63. But it is absolutely inexcusable to charge $106K for a mild hybrid 4 banger, especially when the CLE 53 exists which looks dam good in it's own right, and comes in a 3 liter inline 6 with mild hybrid for...76 Thousand dollars! The GT43 is still a pretty car, but a pretty car for posers. Mercedes...what are we doing? Consumers that bought that thing...what are you doing?\n\nUnpopular opinion but I would say most new Toyota vehicles are way overpriced for what you get. A new Tacoma can run you up to 50 - 60 grand. That is what a full sized truck used to cost. Think about all that you could buy on the used market for the price. You could buy 2 Ford Maveriks for 30k. Is the Tacoma twice the truck? For what most people use it for no way.\n\ncurrently, the Z. It's just a gussied up 370Z with false rarity and dealer markups that dont make sense because it isnt that desirable.\n\nLamborghini Urus. It's an Audi, so there's that. Hardly anyone outside of your cult will know what it is, so there's that, too. At the end of the day it's a quarter million dollar station wagon for your kids to spill their juice boxes in the back seat.\n\nI was just in Palm Beach and the amount of Cullinan's there was downright baffling - and I had this exact thought of, what does a Cullinan do that is worth $300K more than a fully equipped Range Rover or Bentayga? And the only thing I could come up with is: Status. Those people there thrive on social hierarchy, and I suppose can justify the gargantuan price. To me, though - it's absurd.\n\nIf I had that level of money, I'd still be driving my old 4Runner or perhaps a similar era Landcruiser. Why care what the neighbors think unless they're paying my bills? To each their own.\n\nWant more like this?

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has opened the door for tiny cars to be sold in the US — and now Stellantis is bringing an Italian mini car to American shores.\n\nThe auto conglomerate, which owns Jeep and Ram, confirmed on Monday that it would bring the Fiat Topolino — a 2.5-meter-long electric tiny car — to the US.\n\nSpeaking at an event in Michigan, Fiat CEO Olivier Francois said the Topolino's display appearances in the US had sparked \"tremendous excitement,\" adding that the company would share more details about the tiny car's US launch next year.\n\nThe Topolino, which means \"little mouse\" in Italian, is a major departure from the gas-guzzling big trucks that dominate US roads.\n\nBuilt by Italian brand Fiat, the compact city car has a max range of around 47 miles and a top speed of 28 miles per hour.\n\nWeighing less than a golf cart, it's technically classified as an electric quadricycle rather than a car, meaning that it can be driven from age 14 in some European countries.\n\nThe Topolino is available throughout Europe and costs around 9,900 euros ($11,500) in its home market of Italy. Its impending US launch follows a sudden burst of support for tiny cars from an unlikely source — Trump.\n\nThe US president expressed admiration for Japan's pint-sized Kei cars after a recent trip to the country.\n\nTrump described the mini electric models, which are hugely popular in Japan, as \"very cute\" and \"beautiful,\" and said last week that he had loosened regulations to allow manufacturers to build them in the US.\n\nA Stellantis spokesperson told CNBC the announcement of the Topolino's US launch was unrelated to Trump's comments. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nKei cars have developed an enthusiastic cult following in the US, but the vehicles don't meet federal auto standards and can only be imported if they're over 25 years old.\n\nKei cars also face a patchwork of state regulations, with some states limiting them to low speeds or prohibiting them from being driven on public roads entirely.",
