    "fullText": "The head of the First Naval Construction Regiment was removed from his post on Friday, Navy Expeditionary Combat Command announced.\n\nCapt. Douglas Whimpey was relieved of his role as commodore of the regiment after more than two years “due to a loss of confidence in his ability to command,’ the Navy said.\n\n“Navy leaders are expected to uphold the highest standards of responsibility, reliability, and leadership personally and professionally, and the Navy holds them accountable when they fall short of those standards,” the statement said.\n\nWhimpey was removed from the post by Capt. Angel Santiago, head of Naval Construction Group 1.\n\nNews Minnesota Guardsmen told to wear reflective vests to distinguish them from ‘other agencies’\n\nNews Pentagon wants major improvements to runways at Greenland base\n\nNews Husband and wife in the Army compete to see who’s the better medic\n\nThe Navy often uses “loss of confidence” as a catchall term to explain why a commander has been relieved. The term can be and has been used to cover everything from personal misconduct to overall poor performance. The Navy did not provide any additional information on the nature of Whimpey’s firing, except to say that it has “no impact to operations.”\n\nWhimpey, a Navy Reservist, had been in charge of the regiment since 2023. According to his own remarks when he assumed command, he had previously served with the regiment while deployed to Iraq in 2005. It oversees the Seabees of Naval Mobile Construction Battalions 18, 22, and 25. Both the regiment and Naval Construction Group 1 are based out of Port Hueneme, California.\n\nCapt. Steven Sherman, took over as commodore for the regiment. Whimpey has been temporarily assigned to the staff of Naval Construction Group 1.",

    "fullText": "CHICAGO — Shortly after his arrest in early October, Little Village construction worker Juan Espinoza Martinez was led by three federal agents into a windowless interview room, still dressed in a green work T-shirt and carrying a small bottle of water.\n\n“You’re probably a little confused about what’s going on today, so I’m gonna try to explain it all to you,” Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Christopher Perugini told Espinoza Martinez at the outset of the Oct. 6 videotaped interview, which was played for a federal jury Wednesday. “Feel free to ask me any questions you want.”\n\nThen, the agents laid it on Espinoza Martinez, a 37-year-old father of three, why he was there.\n\n“Murder for hire?” Espinoza responded, holding up his hands questioningly.\n\n“Correct, so that’s what the charge you’re charged with,” Perugini said. “I’ll explain it to you as we’re going.”\n\nThe agents then confronted Espinoza Martinez with text messages he’d sent an acquaintance that included a photo of Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, who was then the face of Operation Midway Blitz, along with what agents characterized as cash bounties for Bovino’s kidnapping and murder.\n\nOver the course of the interview, the agents pressed Espinoza Martinez repeatedly on how he thought the messages looked. He said over and over he meant nothing by it, that they were nothing more than social media chatter, and that he had no intention of making any actual offer for Bovino’s killing.\n\n“I’m really confused about this,” Espinoza said at one point in the interview. “I have no gang affiliation…I’m not nowhere around there. I work for a living every day. I’m a union worker. I work concrete, so I don’t know.”\n\nPortions of the videotaped interview were played for jurors in court Wednesday as the trial of Espinoza Martinez got underway before U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow.\n\nEspinoza Martinez, who has lived in Chicago for years but is not a U.S. citizen, is charged in an indictment with a single count of solicitation of murder for hire, which carries up to 10 years in prison.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Espinoza Martinez told an acquaintance from the construction business, Adrian Jimenez, after an immigration agent shot a woman in Chicago’s Brighton Park neighborhood on Oct. 4 “that he had dispatched members of the Latin Kings” to the area of 39th Street and Kedzie Avenue in response to the shooting.\n\nJimenez, who had worked as a government informant on and off for years, called up Homeland Security and shared the Snapchat messages that Espinoza Martinez had sent him saying, “2k on information when you get him” and “10k if u take him down,” along with Bovino’s photo, according to prosecutors.\n\nIn his opening statement to the jury, Assistant U.S. Attorney Minje Shin said the case was not about someone charged with “expressing strong, even angry, views about immigration enforcement policy” or a hatred of Bovino.\n\n“Make no mistake – the evidence in this case will show that what the defendant did was not a joke, not just mouthing off, not just him blowing off steam behind a keyboard, not political discourse … what the defendant did was a solicitation of murder,” Shin said.\n\nShin said Espinoza Martinez was “fixated” on Bovino, who was “the face of the threat” to arrest, detain, and deport members of his community in Little Village, a threat that “hit close to home.”\n\nEspinoza Martinez’s attorney, Jonathan Bedi, told the jurors in his opening remarks that the case was “riddled” with reasonable doubt because “the government cannot point to anything that shows Juan’s intent.”\n\n“When you cut through all of their words…all they have is their guesses and speculation,” Bedi said. “They are guessing.”\n\nBedi says there were no bags of money, no follow up, no recordings, no discussion of any plans. No location scouting, no escape route, no surveillance, no communication saying “Bovino’s here now would be a good time to act.”\n\n“Repeating neighborhood gossip is not a federal crime,” he said.\n\nBefore the Espinoza Martinez’s taped interview was played, jurors heard testimony from the informant, Jimenez, who walked slowly into court with a pronounced limp from a back issue he’s been suffering.\n\nDressed in a blue suit, with a salt-and-pepper beard, Jimenez said he’s been in construction for decades and recently started his own construction business. He also was convicted in 2000 of a felony and spent several years in prison.\n\nThough the jury did not hear details of that case, court records show Jimenez’s conviction was for an armed robbery and home invasion in Franklin Park that was charged in 2000. He was later sentenced to six years behind bars.\n\nJimenez told the jury he’s known Espinoza Martinez for “less than a year.” The defendant first reached out to him on Snapchat, looking for construction work, he said.\n\nJimenez testified he took photos of the Snapchat messages received from Espinoza Martinez on Oct. 2 and “almost immediately” contacted agents with HSI about them.\n\nJimenez testifies he had conversations about immigration with Espinoza Martinez “more than a few times.”\n\nBut when Shin attempted to ask what they talked about specifically, the defense repeatedly objected and the judge sustained it.\n\nOn cross-examination, defense attorney Dena Singer asked Jimenez a series of questions: You have a family, right? You work? You want to continue working and you want to continue staying in the U.S.? And you take care of your kids?\n\nJimenez answered “Yes” to all of them.\n\n“And you’re not somebody who commits murder-for-hire, right?” Singer asked,\n\nSinger also got Jimenez to acknowledge that Espinoza Martinez never asked him to take any action against Bovino or share the message with any wider audience.\n\nDid he ever say “Here’s where Bovino is going to be next?” Singer asked.\n\n“Did he ever say “Here’s a picture of cash,” or “I have someone who can pay you all this cash?'”\n\nEspinoza Martinez’s trial is the first criminal case to stem from Operation Midway Blitz to go to trial.\n\nThough limited in scope, the case is expected to offer an important litmus test as immigration-enforcement operations continue to roil Chicago and other Democrat-led cities long targeted by President Donald Trump, including Minneapolis, where the killing of a U.S. citizen by an immigration agent earlier this month has sparked nationwide protests.\n\nThe case was held up by top Department of Homeland Security officials as an example of the violence and threats immigration agents were facing from gang members and even international drug cartels.\n\nIn the months since, however, evidence of Espinoza Martinez’s supposed gang affiliations has not materialized. Prosecutors vastly toned down that aspect of the case, first dropping mention of gang affiliation in the indictment handed up by a grand jury, then saying in a pretrial hearing they only intended to prove Espinoza Martinez had an “affinity” for the Latin Kings.\n\nOn Tuesday, the defense objected to prosecutors introducing a text string where Espinoza Martinez told an unidentified contact: “It’s going down bro my guys are ready in the vill (Little Village). Saints sd and 2Six being bitches. Kings on they ass n they scared.”\n\nProsecutors argued the conversation showed Espinoza Martinez was disappointed other gangs weren’t fighting back.\n\nBut Lefkow sided partially with the defense, saying the comments on Little Village can be shown to the jury, but not the references to the Latin Saints or Two-Six gangs.\n\nShe also excluded later text by Espinoza Martinez about “Chapo” having the Latin Kings’ back — a reference to former Sinaloa Cartel boss Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.",

    "description": "The AI boom is threatening white-collar entry jobs—but it’s creating a booming six-figure opportunity for electricians, plumbers, and construction workers.",
    "fullText": "The job market has been a tough sell for many Gen Z graduates, with tariffs, economic uncertainty, and artificial intelligence reshaping hiring plans across corporate America. But according to Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang, the next wave of six-figure opportunities won’t be found in a Wall Street cubicle or Silicon Valley Slack channel. Instead, high-paying careers will partially come by picking up a wrench—literally.\n\nAs tech giants race to build sprawling data centers—totaling $7 trillion in global capital outlays by the end of the decade—Huang believes the world is on the cusp of what he calls the “largest infrastructure buildout in human history,” which will create “a lot of jobs.”\n\n“It’s wonderful that the jobs are related to tradecraft, and we’re going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steelworkers,” he said in conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nThe hands-on skills needed to construct what he described as chip, computer, and AI factories are already facing shortages—even though many roles pay over $100,000 without requiring a college degree. One McKinsey report estimated that between 2023 and 2030, there will be a need for an additional 130,000 trained electricians—as well as 240,000 construction laborers and 150,000 construction supervisors—in the U.S. alone.\n\n“Everybody should be able to make a great living,” Huang said. “You don’t need to have a Ph.D. in computer science to do so.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time Huang has expressed his optimistic outlook on new career paths emerging alongside AI.\n\n“The skilled craft segment of every economy is going to see a boom,” he told Channel 4 News in the U.K. last year. “You’re going to have to be doubling and doubling and doubling every single year.”\n\nThat optimism stands in contrast to warnings from leaders like Ford CEO Jim Farley, who has repeatedly cautioned that AI is hollowing out traditional white-collar entry points—just as the education system continues to funnel students toward four-year degrees.\n\n“There’s more than one way to the American Dream, but our whole education system is focused on four-year [college] education,” Farley said at the Aspen Ideas Festival last year. “Hiring an entry worker at a tech company has fallen 50% since 2019. Is that really where we want all of our kids to go? Artificial intelligence is gonna replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.”",

    "fullText": "Umarell (Italian spelling of the Bolognese Emilian word umarèl, Emilian pronunciation: [umaˈrɛːl]; plural umarî) are men of retirement age who spend their time watching construction sites, especially roadworks – stereotypically with hands clasped behind their back and offering unrequested advice to the workers.[1] Its literal meaning is \"little man\" (also umaréin).[2] The term is employed as lighthearted mockery or self-deprecation.\n\nThe modern term was popularised in 2005 by local writer Danilo Masotti[3][4] through three books and an associated blog.[5][6] The word was included in the Italian Zingarelli dictionary in 2021[7][8][9][10][11] and in 2024 was included by Language Council of Sweden in the annual list of new Swedish words – the Språkrådets nyordslista [sv].[12][13]\n\nIn 2015, the city of Riccione, approximately 130 kilometres (80 miles) southeast of Bologna, allocated an €11,000 budget to pay a wage to umarells to oversee worksites in the city – counting the number of trucks in and out to ensure materials were delivered/removed according to the receipts, and guarding against theft when the site was otherwise unattended.[14] The town of San Lazzaro di Savena, 6 km (3+1⁄2 mi) to the South-East of Bologna, awarded the \"Umarell of the year\" prize to a local resident, Franco Bonini.[15][16]\n\nIn 2016, the local cultural association called Succede solo a Bologna (\"It only happens in Bologna\") released the \"Umarèl card\" as a fundraiser for continued restoration of the San Petronio church.[17][18] Separately, a mobile app called Umarells was released that tracked the location of ongoing roadworks and construction sites.[19][20] The fast food restaurant chain Burger King also \"hired\" several umarells as part of a social media marketing campaign promoting its increased presence in the country.[21]\n\nIn July 2017, the Bologna city council's \"consultative commission for street naming\" approved the naming of a public square to the East of the city centre in the Cirenaica district Piazzetta degli Umarells in recognition of the local fame of the concept and the name – noting with conscious irony that the square was under construction at the time.[22][23][24][25]\n\nIn April 2018, the public square was inaugurated by city councillor Matteo Lepore, the district president Simone Borsari, the \"lord of the umarells\" Franco Bonini, the stand-up comedian Maurizio Pagliari (Dulio Pizzocchi), and the writer Danilo Masotti.[26] A year later the street-sign for the square was stolen.[27]\n\nIn April 2020, the comic magazine Topolino dedicated an episode to the umarell Gerindo Persichetti.[28] In December 2020 in Pescara, the real estate developer Sarra installed windows to allow Umarells to observe three construction sites.[29][30] Since 2019, an annual calendar has been sold in Bologna newsstands. In 2021, a board game La Giornata dell’Umarell (An Umarell's Day) was released.[31]\n\nHaving officially entered the Swedish language in 2024,[13] in October 2025 the municipality of Karlskoga formally inaugurated \"Umarell benches\" (sv: umarell-bänkar) for locals to monitor the construction of a local bathhouse.[32][33]",

At the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Senior Judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not explain why it could not take action short of a complete stop to construction on Revolution Wind while it considers ways to mitigate its national security concerns.

    "fullText": "A federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as President Donald Trump seeks to shut it down.\n\nAt the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Senior Judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not explain why it could not take action short of a complete stop to construction on Revolution Wind while it considers ways to mitigate its national security concerns. He said it also did not provide sufficient reasoning for its change in position.\n\nRevolution Wind has received all of its federal permits and is nearly 90% complete to provide power for Rhode Island and Connecticut.\n\nTrump says his goal is to not let any “windmills” be built. Three energy developers are challenging the administration’s freeze of their offshore wind projects in the federal courts this week.\n\nDanish energy company Orsted, Norwegian company Equinor, and Dominion Energy Virginia each sued to ask the courts to vacate and set aside the administration’s Dec. 22 order to freeze five big projects on the East Coast over national security concerns. Orsted’s hearing was first on its Revolution Wind project. Orsted said it will soon resume construction to deliver affordable, reliable power to the Northeast.\n\nThe administration did not reveal specifics about its national security concerns, but Trump said Friday while meeting with oil industry executives about investing in Venezuela that wind farms are “losers.” He said they lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds.\n\n“I’ve told my people we will not approve windmills,” Trump said. “Maybe we get forced to do something because some stupid person in the Biden administration agreed to do something years ago. We will not approve any windmills in this country.”\n\nThe Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution. Trump began reversing the country’s energy policies his first day in office with a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal. A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nThe Trump administration paused leases for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind. New York’s attorney general sued the Trump administration on Friday over Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind.\n\nRevolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both major offshore wind projects by Orsted. Rhode Island and Connecticut filed their own request in court to try to save Revolution Wind.\n\n“The law takes precedent over the political whims of one man, and we will continue to fight to make sure that remains the case,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.\n\nAt Monday's hearing, attorney Janice Schneider, representing Revolution Wind, said the stop work order came at a critical stage of construction, with the project nearly 90% built and weeks away from beginning to deliver power to the electric grid. She said the delay is costing more than $1.4 million per day, and a specialized vessel has just enough time now to install the remaining turbines before its contract is up at the site in February.\n\nSchneider said they take national security issues seriously, but the government has not shared more information about its concerns with their experts who have security clearances, or shared unclassified summaries.\n\n“We do think that this court should be very skeptical of the government’s true motives here,\" Schneider said, citing Trump's comments from Friday.\n\nDepartment of Justice attorney Peter Torstensen argued that national security is paramount and protecting against new risks identified in the classified materials outweighs any alleged irreparable harm to the developers.\n\nWork on the Revolution Wind project was previously paused on Aug. 22 for what the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said were national security concerns. A month later, Judge Lamberth ruled the project could resume, citing the irreparable harm to the developers and the demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits of their claim. Orsted is building it with Skyborn Renewables.\n\nWith four offshore wind projects still stalled, Hillary Bright, executive director of offshore wind advocacy group Turn Forward, said she's hopeful that they will prevail in court and that the administration will begin to understand \"the immense benefits that these nearly complete power sources can bring to our nation’s energy and national security.”\n\nEquinor owns Empire Wind. Its limited liability company, Empire Wind LLC, said the project faces “likely termination” if construction can’t resume by this Friday because the order disrupts a tightly choreographed construction schedule dependent on vessels with very limited availability. Its hearing is Wednesday.\n\n“I would like to think that offshore wind is, and will continue to be, part of an all-of-the-above energy solution, which our country desperately needs,” said Molly Morris, Equinor’s senior vice president overseeing Empire Wind.\n\nDominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, was the first to sue. It’s asking a judge to block the order, calling it “arbitrary and capricious” and unconstitutional. Its hearing is Friday.\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations. AP is solely responsible for all content.

    "description": "Heading into 2026, leaders are still bullish on AI despite worries about a bubble and struggles to demonstrate value with AI investments. According to a survey of digital leaders at leading global companies, the vast majority of leaders believe that AI is a high priority for their organization, have plans to spend more on it, and report that their company is getting measurable business value from their AI investments. The highly positive perspectives of these leaders on AI may suggest that the party can go on—high valuations of AI vendors, rising stock prices, a boom in data center construction, and initiatives to transform organizations around AI’s capabilities. But the survey also surfaced persistent issues around change and human and organizational readiness to take next steps. Organizations need to be able to address these in the coming years if they hope to achieve long-term success with AI.",

    "fullText": "A massive solar panel array in China is expected to crack 7,000 megawatts of power generation in 2026, according to EnergiesMedia.\n\nThe Three Gorges Kubuqi Solar Park has been under construction since 2022, blanketing an Inner Mongolian desert in panels. It already has over five gigawatts of capacity installed.\n\n\"Sandy and mostly devoid of life, the Kubuqi Desert in Inner Mongolia once had a reputation for being a 'sea of death.' More recently, its dune fields have become a sea of photovoltaic possibility, transformed by a surge of newly installed solar panels,\" NASA said of the project. \"The construction is part of China's multiyear plan to build a 'solar great wall' designed to generate enough energy to power Beijing.\"\n\nDoing so has the potential to displace China's heavy reliance on coal power. This energy source generates some of the highest levels of pollution in the world, contributing to more destructive weather patterns and steep health costs for locals.\n\nThe Three Gorges Kubuqi Solar Park, due to be completed in 2030, will be 250 miles long, three miles wide, and will be able to generate 100 gigawatts of clean energy. Locals are also enjoying the unexpected benefits of the project.\n\n\"These projects shield us from wind and sand, allowing our village to cultivate over 10,000 mu (600 hectares) of high-standard farmland this year. If leased out, the land can bring villagers 900 yuan ($128) per mu each year,\" said local farmer Han Rongkuan, per Xinhua.\n\nLarge-scale solar is an important step to displacing polluting fuels, like coal, gas, and oil, but home solar does its part, too.\n\n• EnergySage can help you save up to $10,000 on installations by curating competitive bids from local installers \n• Not ready to spend up front? Palmetto's $0-down LightReach solar leasing program can lower your utility rate by up to 20% \n• TCD's Solar Explorer makes it easy to access exclusive offers from preferred partners\n\nYou can get even more out of home solar upgrades by using TCD's HVAC Explorer.
