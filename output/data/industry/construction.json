    "fullText": "Umarell (Italian spelling of the Bolognese Emilian word umarèl, Emilian pronunciation: [umaˈrɛːl]; plural umarî) are men of retirement age who spend their time watching construction sites, especially roadworks – stereotypically with hands clasped behind their back and offering unrequested advice to the workers.[1] Its literal meaning is \"little man\" (also umaréin).[2] The term is employed as lighthearted mockery or self-deprecation.\n\nThe modern term was popularised in 2005 by local writer Danilo Masotti[3][4] through three books and an associated blog.[5][6] The word was included in the Italian Zingarelli dictionary in 2021[7][8][9][10][11] and in 2024 was included by Language Council of Sweden in the annual list of new Swedish words – the Språkrådets nyordslista [sv].[12][13]\n\nIn 2015, the city of Riccione, approximately 130 kilometres (80 miles) southeast of Bologna, allocated an €11,000 budget to pay a wage to umarells to oversee worksites in the city – counting the number of trucks in and out to ensure materials were delivered/removed according to the receipts, and guarding against theft when the site was otherwise unattended.[14] The town of San Lazzaro di Savena, 6 km (3+1⁄2 mi) to the South-East of Bologna, awarded the \"Umarell of the year\" prize to a local resident, Franco Bonini.[15][16]\n\nIn 2016, the local cultural association called Succede solo a Bologna (\"It only happens in Bologna\") released the \"Umarèl card\" as a fundraiser for continued restoration of the San Petronio church.[17][18] Separately, a mobile app called Umarells was released that tracked the location of ongoing roadworks and construction sites.[19][20] The fast food restaurant chain Burger King also \"hired\" several umarells as part of a social media marketing campaign promoting its increased presence in the country.[21]\n\nIn July 2017, the Bologna city council's \"consultative commission for street naming\" approved the naming of a public square to the East of the city centre in the Cirenaica district Piazzetta degli Umarells in recognition of the local fame of the concept and the name – noting with conscious irony that the square was under construction at the time.[22][23][24][25]\n\nIn April 2018, the public square was inaugurated by city councillor Matteo Lepore, the district president Simone Borsari, the \"lord of the umarells\" Franco Bonini, the stand-up comedian Maurizio Pagliari (Dulio Pizzocchi), and the writer Danilo Masotti.[26] A year later the street-sign for the square was stolen.[27]\n\nIn April 2020, the comic magazine Topolino dedicated an episode to the umarell Gerindo Persichetti.[28] In December 2020 in Pescara, the real estate developer Sarra installed windows to allow Umarells to observe three construction sites.[29][30] Since 2019, an annual calendar has been sold in Bologna newsstands. In 2021, a board game La Giornata dell’Umarell (An Umarell's Day) was released.[31]\n\nHaving officially entered the Swedish language in 2024,[13] in October 2025 the municipality of Karlskoga formally inaugurated \"Umarell benches\" (sv: umarell-bänkar) for locals to monitor the construction of a local bathhouse.[32][33]",

The drivers were from Guatemala and Honduras.\n\n\"ICE did not enter the Meta site at any time,\" the office said.\n\nMeta declined to comment to Business Insider.\n\nThe Meta project is the largest of several multi-gigawatt data centers that CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said will come online as the company races to catch up on AI computing capacity.\n\nWednesday's arrests crystallize an issue that companies have increasingly had to grapple with over the past year: how to prepare workers for an ICE encounter, whether on or off company property.\n\nThe action also follows a recent surge of ICE activity in cities and towns across the US, which has met some resistance in Democratic-led states.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry has been a prominent supporter of President Donald Trump's immigration policies. The state is receiving nearly $1 million a month to house detainees at its Angola prison, Axios reported, citing public records.",

At the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Senior Judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not explain why it could not take action short of a complete stop to construction on Revolution Wind while it considers ways to mitigate its national security concerns.

    "fullText": "A federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as President Donald Trump seeks to shut it down.\n\nAt the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Senior Judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not explain why it could not take action short of a complete stop to construction on Revolution Wind while it considers ways to mitigate its national security concerns. He said it also did not provide sufficient reasoning for its change in position.\n\nRevolution Wind has received all of its federal permits and is nearly 90% complete to provide power for Rhode Island and Connecticut.\n\nTrump says his goal is to not let any “windmills” be built. Three energy developers are challenging the administration’s freeze of their offshore wind projects in the federal courts this week.\n\nDanish energy company Orsted, Norwegian company Equinor, and Dominion Energy Virginia each sued to ask the courts to vacate and set aside the administration’s Dec. 22 order to freeze five big projects on the East Coast over national security concerns. Orsted’s hearing was first on its Revolution Wind project. Orsted said it will soon resume construction to deliver affordable, reliable power to the Northeast.\n\nThe administration did not reveal specifics about its national security concerns, but Trump said Friday while meeting with oil industry executives about investing in Venezuela that wind farms are “losers.” He said they lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds.\n\n“I’ve told my people we will not approve windmills,” Trump said. “Maybe we get forced to do something because some stupid person in the Biden administration agreed to do something years ago. We will not approve any windmills in this country.”\n\nThe Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution. Trump began reversing the country’s energy policies his first day in office with a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal. A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nThe Trump administration paused leases for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind. New York’s attorney general sued the Trump administration on Friday over Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind.\n\nRevolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both major offshore wind projects by Orsted. Rhode Island and Connecticut filed their own request in court to try to save Revolution Wind.\n\n“The law takes precedent over the political whims of one man, and we will continue to fight to make sure that remains the case,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.\n\nAt Monday's hearing, attorney Janice Schneider, representing Revolution Wind, said the stop work order came at a critical stage of construction, with the project nearly 90% built and weeks away from beginning to deliver power to the electric grid. She said the delay is costing more than $1.4 million per day, and a specialized vessel has just enough time now to install the remaining turbines before its contract is up at the site in February.\n\nSchneider said they take national security issues seriously, but the government has not shared more information about its concerns with their experts who have security clearances, or shared unclassified summaries.\n\n“We do think that this court should be very skeptical of the government’s true motives here,\" Schneider said, citing Trump's comments from Friday.\n\nDepartment of Justice attorney Peter Torstensen argued that national security is paramount and protecting against new risks identified in the classified materials outweighs any alleged irreparable harm to the developers.\n\nWork on the Revolution Wind project was previously paused on Aug. 22 for what the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said were national security concerns. A month later, Judge Lamberth ruled the project could resume, citing the irreparable harm to the developers and the demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits of their claim. Orsted is building it with Skyborn Renewables.\n\nWith four offshore wind projects still stalled, Hillary Bright, executive director of offshore wind advocacy group Turn Forward, said she's hopeful that they will prevail in court and that the administration will begin to understand \"the immense benefits that these nearly complete power sources can bring to our nation’s energy and national security.”\n\nEquinor owns Empire Wind. Its limited liability company, Empire Wind LLC, said the project faces “likely termination” if construction can’t resume by this Friday because the order disrupts a tightly choreographed construction schedule dependent on vessels with very limited availability. Its hearing is Wednesday.\n\n“I would like to think that offshore wind is, and will continue to be, part of an all-of-the-above energy solution, which our country desperately needs,” said Molly Morris, Equinor’s senior vice president overseeing Empire Wind.\n\nDominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, was the first to sue. It’s asking a judge to block the order, calling it “arbitrary and capricious” and unconstitutional. Its hearing is Friday.\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations. AP is solely responsible for all content.

    "fullText": "A massive solar panel array in China is expected to crack 7,000 megawatts of power generation in 2026, according to EnergiesMedia.\n\nThe Three Gorges Kubuqi Solar Park has been under construction since 2022, blanketing an Inner Mongolian desert in panels. It already has over five gigawatts of capacity installed.\n\n\"Sandy and mostly devoid of life, the Kubuqi Desert in Inner Mongolia once had a reputation for being a 'sea of death.' More recently, its dune fields have become a sea of photovoltaic possibility, transformed by a surge of newly installed solar panels,\" NASA said of the project. \"The construction is part of China's multiyear plan to build a 'solar great wall' designed to generate enough energy to power Beijing.\"\n\nDoing so has the potential to displace China's heavy reliance on coal power. This energy source generates some of the highest levels of pollution in the world, contributing to more destructive weather patterns and steep health costs for locals.\n\nThe Three Gorges Kubuqi Solar Park, due to be completed in 2030, will be 250 miles long, three miles wide, and will be able to generate 100 gigawatts of clean energy. Locals are also enjoying the unexpected benefits of the project.\n\n\"These projects shield us from wind and sand, allowing our village to cultivate over 10,000 mu (600 hectares) of high-standard farmland this year. If leased out, the land can bring villagers 900 yuan ($128) per mu each year,\" said local farmer Han Rongkuan, per Xinhua.\n\nLarge-scale solar is an important step to displacing polluting fuels, like coal, gas, and oil, but home solar does its part, too.\n\n• EnergySage can help you save up to $10,000 on installations by curating competitive bids from local installers \n• Not ready to spend up front?
