    "description": "An interactive journey through number system construction. Start with nothing and build natural numbers, integers, rationals, reals, and complex numbers, one crisis at a time.",
    "fullText": "I don't mean \"what does the symbol 3 look like\" or \"how do you count to ten.\" Where does the number three actually live? You can hold three apples, but you can't hold threeness. You can write the digit 3, but that's ink on paper. So what is it?\n\nYou can swap apples for stars or boxes, but the count stays the same. \"Three\" is whatever all groups-of-three have in common. But that's circular. What is the thing they have in common?\n\nThere are so many numbers: 1, 3/7, pi, 3.12. Where did these come from? Mathematics is people making up a rule and following it to see what happens.\n\nWe'll do that here. We start with nothing: no numbers, no arithmetic, no assumptions. By the end we'll have built the natural numbers, the integers, the rationals, the reals, and the complex numbers.\n\nWe need a starting point. Say there is one thing, a starting object we'll call zero. Not zero the quantity you already know, but just a name for where we begin.\n\nNow one rule. Given any object, you can produce the next one. Write this as a function SS, where S(n)S(n) means \"the successor of nn.\" S(0)S(0) is the first object we generate, S(S(0))S(S(0)) is the second, and so on. There's no addition and no multiplication yet. All you can do is say \"give me the next one.\"\n\nThat's all counting is. Keep applying the one rule. You don't need to know what 7 \"means\" to get there. Apply SS seven times and you land on the seventh object.\n\nThis chain never stops. There's no largest natural number, because every number has a successor. Mathematicians call this infinite: the process of taking successors has no end. We write this unbounded behavior with symbols like ∞\\infty in limits and extended settings. But ∞\\infty itself is not a natural number. A finite value is any specific natural number you can reach by stopping at some point, like 7, 400, or a trillion. When we say something \"goes to infinity,\" we mean it keeps increasing past every finite value, never arriving anywhere.\n\nYou can always go forward, but you can't go back. There's no predecessor of zero, and there's no shortcut. To reach 5 you have to pass through 1, 2, 3, and 4 first.\n\nBut how do we know this chain is all there is? Our rules say \"there's a starting point\" and \"every object has a successor.\" Nothing prevents a rogue cluster of objects (say A, B, C) forming their own loop, each one the successor of the previous, disconnected from zero. The successor rule would still be satisfied. We need something extra.\n\nInduction. Picture a chain of dominoes. Show that domino 0 falls (the base case). Then show that whenever domino nn falls, it knocks over domino S(n)S(n) (the inductive step). If both hold, every domino in the chain falls, and no domino outside the chain can claim to be part of the system.\n\nOnce domino 0 falls, and each domino tips the next, the whole chain goes down. In the strongest version of this idea, the natural numbers are exactly the things you can reach from 0 by repeating successor. A rogue cluster disconnected from zero? This rule excludes it, because the chain from 0 never reaches it. (Logic side note: in some weaker rule systems, mathematicians can build versions with extra \"numbers\" beyond this chain.)\n\nMathematicians call this the natural numbers, written N\\mathbb{N}. A standard axiom list (axioms are just starting rules) for this is called the Peano axioms. The core ingredients are a starting point (zero), a rule (successor), and induction (nothing else sneaks in), plus two guardrails: 0 is not anyone's successor, and different numbers have different successors.\n\nCounting is fine, but we need arithmetic. Addition comes from SS and two rules:\n\na+S(b)=S(a+b)a + S(b) = S(a + b)\n\nAdding zero changes nothing. Adding the successor of bb is the same as taking the successor of a+ba + b. It's recursive, meaning the rule calls itself on a smaller input until bb hits 0.\n\nTo compute 2+32 + 3, the rules unwind: 2+S(2)=S(2+2)2 + S(2) = S(2 + 2), then 2+S(1)=S(2+1)2 + S(1) = S(2 + 1), then 2+S(0)=S(2+0)=S(2)2 + S(0) = S(2 + 0) = S(2). Each step peels off one SS from bb and wraps one SS around the result, until the base case a+0=aa + 0 = a stops the recursion.\n\nMultiplication follows the same recursive pattern, defined in terms of addition:\n\na×S(b)=a+(a×b)a \\times S(b) = a + (a \\times b)\n\nMultiplying by zero gives zero. Multiplying by the successor of bb means computing a×ba \\times b and adding one more aa. Recursive again, where each layer adds one copy of aa. So 3×S(S(S(0)))3 \\times S(S(S(0))) unwinds to 3+(3+(3+0))3 + (3 + (3 + 0)).\n\nEvery operation reduces to repeated applications of simpler ones. Multiplication is repeated addition, and addition is repeated successor. The whole thing rests on the successor function.\n\nAdding any two natural numbers always produces another natural number. Multiplying them does too. This property is called closure, meaning the naturals are closed under addition and multiplication. Every operation stays inside the system, and the next operation we try won't.\n\nThe natural numbers feel complete. Add or multiply any two of them and you always get another natural number.\n\nBut addition raises a question. If a+b=ca + b = c, can you recover bb from aa and cc? \"I had some apples, you gave me 3, now I have 8. How many did I start with?\" That's subtraction.\n\n5 minus 3 is 2, that works. 7 minus 7 is 0, still works. Try 3 minus 5.\n\nIn the natural numbers, 3 minus 5 has no answer. You can't go below zero, so the operation just fails. Subtraction breaks closure. You can set up a subtraction with two natural numbers, but the result might not be one.\n\nSubtraction produces results our system can't represent. We could ban it when it fails, or expand the system so it always works.\n\nHow do you represent \"below zero\" when all you have are natural numbers? Represent every integer as a pair (a,b)(a, b), where the pair means \"aa minus bb.\"\n\nSo (5,2)(5, 2) means 3. But (6,3)(6, 3) also means 3, and so does (7,4)(7, 4), and (100,97)(100, 97). All these pairs represent the same integer.\n\nThis is an equivalence class, a collection of representations that all behave identically. The integer 3 is the whole collection of pairs whose difference is 3.\n\nDefining integers as pairs is only useful if we can do arithmetic with them. Adding two pairs: (a,b)+(c,d)=(a+c,b+d)(a, b) + (c, d) = (a + c, b + d). Combine the positives and the negatives separately. If different pairs representing the same integer produce the same answer, the definition is consistent.\n\nThis consistency isn't obvious. Different pairs represent the same integer, so arithmetic has to give the same result no matter which representative you pick. It does. Mathematicians call this well-definedness: the answer doesn't depend on which equivalent form you started with.\n\nThis gives us the integers, Z\\mathbb{Z}. Every natural number is still here (write it as (n,0)(n, 0)), but now we also have negative numbers. Subtraction demanded they exist.\n\nThe number line extends left of zero, and the operations that broke before work.\n\n3 minus 5 kicked us out of ℕ, but in ℤ it's just −2, a point on the number line two steps left of zero. Every subtraction lands somewhere.\n\nNow that we have negative numbers, what happens when we multiply them? Negative times negative being positive isn't a convention. It follows from rules we already have. Multiplication distributes over addition: a×(b+c)=a×b+a×ca \\times (b + c) = a \\times b + a \\times c. This is the distributive law. Since multiplication is repeated addition, a×(b+c)a \\times (b + c) means \"jump by aa a total of b+cb + c times.\" Do all those jumps at once, or bb first then cc more, and you end up at the same spot either way:\n\nTry applying it. (−1)×(1+(−1))=(−1)×0=0(-1) \\times (1 + (-1)) = (-1) \\times 0 = 0. Distributing the left side gives (−1)×1+(−1)×(−1)=0(-1) \\times 1 + (-1) \\times (-1) = 0, which simplifies to −1+(−1)(−1)=0-1 + (-1)(-1) = 0, forcing (−1)(−1)=1(-1)(-1) = 1. The distributive law leaves no room for a negative result.\n\nThe integers handle subtraction. Subtract any two integers and you stay inside Z\\mathbb{Z}. Closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication. But try dividing.\n\n6 divided by 3 is 2, that works. 10 divided by 2 is 5, still works. What about 1 divided by 3?\n\nThere's no integer equal to one-third. Division breaks closure the same way subtraction broke the naturals.\n\nSame fix as before: pairs. This time (a,b)(a, b) means \"aa divided by bb.\" The top number aa is the numerator, the bottom bb is the denominator. These are the rational numbers.\n\nLike integers, different pairs can represent the same value. (1,2)(1, 2) and (2,4)(2, 4) and (3,6)(3, 6) are all the same rational number.\n\nThe numerator and denominator grow, but the proportion stays constant. Each scaled version is a different pair, same equivalence class. The rational number one-half is the collection of pairs (k,2k)(k, 2k) for every positive integer kk.\n\nArithmetic works like it did for integers. Adding two fractions: (a,b)+(c,d)=(ad+bc,bd)(a, b) + (c, d) = (ad + bc, bd). Cross-multiply the numerators, multiply the denominators.\n\nMultiplying: (a,b)×(c,d)=(ac,bd)(a, b) \\times (c, d) = (ac, bd). Straight across, numerator times numerator, denominator times denominator.\n\nThese are the fraction rules you already know, but we derived them from the pair construction instead of assuming them. And well-definedness holds: different representatives of the same rational give the same results.\n\nTo divide: (a,b)÷(c,d)=(a,b)×(d,c)(a, b) \\div (c, d) = (a, b) \\times (d, c). Flip the second fraction and multiply. Try 7 ÷ 4, the operation that had no integer answer.\n\nThe rationals, Q\\mathbb{Q}, fix division. Add, subtract, multiply, or divide any two rationals (except by zero) and the result is always rational. Closed under all four operations. A system like this is called a field, a number system where these operations behave the usual way.\n\nPick any two rationals, say 1/3 and 1/2. Their average, 5/12, is rational and sits between them. Now pick 1/3 and 5/12. Their average is between those. You can keep going forever and never run out of rationals to wedge in.\n\nMathematicians call this density. Between any two rationals, there's always another one. They seem to fill the number line completely.\n\nEvery crisis so far came from reversing an operation. Subtraction reverses addition, division reverses multiplication. There's one more reversal. You can square a number (3×3=93 \\times 3 = 9), so what number times itself produces a given result? That's the square root. 9=3\\sqrt{9} = 3 because 3×3=93 \\times 3 = 9.\n\nEvery rational number can be written as a decimal. Divide numerator by denominator one digit at a time: take the remainder, bring down a zero (multiply by 10), see how many times the denominator fits. The quotient digit goes after the decimal point, repeat.\n\nWhen the remainder hits zero, the decimal terminates. When a remainder you've already seen comes back, the same digits repeat forever. Try 1/4 (terminates), then 1/3 (repeats).\n\nSome fractions terminate: 1/4=0.251/4 = 0.25, 3/8=0.3753/8 = 0.375. Others repeat forever: 1/3=0.333...1/3 = 0.333..., where the long division produces remainder 1 every step, so digit 3 comes out every step, without end. That trailing \"...\" hides something important. You need infinitely many digits to pin down the value, and no finite string of them lands on it exactly. Fractions and decimals are two notations for the same values.\n\nFor perfect squares this works. 4=2\\sqrt{4} = 2, 9=3\\sqrt{9} = 3, 16=4\\sqrt{16} = 4. But what about 2\\sqrt{2}? What rational number, multiplied by itself, gives exactly 2? Try 1.4: 1.42=1.961.4^2 = 1.96, a little too small. Try 1.5: 1.52=2.251.5^2 = 2.25, too big. So 2\\sqrt{2} is between 1.4 and 1.5. Keep going: 1.412=1.98811.41^2 = 1.9881, 1.422=2.01641.42^2 = 2.0164. Each digit narrows the bracket, and you can zoom in forever. But no fraction will ever land on it exactly. Not because there's an interval with no rationals (there isn't, they're dense), but because this specific limit point is missing from Q\\mathbb{Q}.\n\nNo matter how far you zoom, the square root of 2 sits between rational ticks, never on one. The rationals are dense, meaning between any two of them there's always another one. But they're not complete.\n\nTo see what \"complete\" means, we need two ideas first. A sequence is an ordered list of numbers that never ends. It has a first term, a second term, a third, and keeps going. This is what the \"...\" in 1/3=0.333...1/3 = 0.333... was hiding. The values 0.3, 0.33, 0.333, 0.3333, ... form a sequence of finite decimals that edges closer and closer to 1/31/3 without any single term equaling it. The decimal approximations of 2\\sqrt{2} form a sequence too: 1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, 1.4142, ....\n\nA sequence converges when its terms settle toward a single value. The gap between each term and that target keeps shrinking, and it shrinks past any threshold you name. That target value is called the limit of the sequence. The sequence 1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, ... converges toward 2\\sqrt{2}. By the fifth term the gap is less than 0.001, and by the tenth it's less than 0.0000000001. It never reaches the limit, but it gets arbitrarily close.\n\nNow we can say what completeness means. If the terms of a sequence keep bunching closer and closer together (mathematicians call this a Cauchy sequence), a complete system guarantees the sequence converges to something in the system. The rationals fail this test. You can write a Cauchy sequence of rationals whose terms squeeze tighter and tighter around 2\\sqrt{2}, but there's no rational for it to land on.\n\nTo fill the holes, we construct the real numbers, R\\mathbb{R}. A real number is an equivalence class of Cauchy sequences of rationals. Just as the integer 3 was the whole collection of pairs with difference 3, the real number 2\\sqrt{2} is the whole collection of rational sequences converging toward it.\n\nEach term below is a fraction. Each one gets closer to 2\\sqrt{2}, but the target itself lives in the gap between all of them.\n\nThat sequence is one representative. But there are infinitely many other rational sequences converging to the same gap. Here are three completely different strategies, each producing a sequence of fractions that closes in on 2\\sqrt{2}:\n\nOne approach is to average guesses. Start with 1. Since 12=11^2 = 1 is too small, 2\\sqrt{2} must be bigger, so 2/1=22/1 = 2 is too big. Average the guess and the correction: (1+2)/2=3/2(1 + 2)/2 = 3/2. Now 3/23/2 is too big ((3/2)2=9/4(3/2)^2 = 9/4), and 2/(3/2)=4/32/(3/2) = 4/3 is too small, so average again: (3/2+4/3)/2=17/12(3/2 + 4/3)/2 = 17/12. Each step squares the error, so the fractions lock onto 2\\sqrt{2} fast.\n\nAnother approach looks for the fraction with the smallest denominator closest to the target. For 2\\sqrt{2}, it produces 1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, 41/29, .... These are the best rational approximations you can get without using bigger denominators, and they alternate between slightly too small and slightly too big.\n\nThe simplest approach is brute force: chop the decimal expansion at each digit. 1, 14/10, 141/100, 1414/1000, .... Each fraction is just the decimal truncation written as a ratio. It converges, but slowly compared to the other two.\n\nAll three strategies generate different sequences of fractions, but they all close in on the same spot. The real number 2\\sqrt{2} is all of them at once, the whole equivalence class.\n\nThe reals complete the number line. Every Cauchy sequence of real numbers converges to a real number. There are no more holes.\n\nThe reals also include other numbers that the rationals miss. Take a circle whose diameter is exactly 1. How long is its circumference, the distance around it? You can measure a straight line by laying a ruler along it. A shape made entirely of straight sides, called a polygon (triangle, square, hexagon, and so on), is almost as easy since you just measure each side and add them up. But a circle has no straight sides. You can't break it into flat pieces and add their lengths.\n\nYou can get close, though. Inscribe a polygon inside the circle so that every corner touches the edge. A triangle (3 sides) gives a rough underestimate. A square (4 sides) is better. A hexagon (6 sides), better still. Each polygon is made of straight segments you can measure exactly, and as you add more sides the polygon hugs the circle more tightly. Its perimeter creeps toward the true circumference. That value is π≈3.14159...\\pi \\approx 3.14159...\n\nNo fraction equals π\\pi exactly. Like 2\\sqrt{2}, it sits in a gap between rationals. Numbers like this are called irrational (not equal to any ratio of whole numbers). It's another equivalence class of Cauchy sequences: 3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, 3.1415, ....\n\nAnother irrational number shows up when you ask about growth. Suppose you invest €1 at 100% annual interest. Compounded once at year's end, you get €2€2. Compounded twice (50% every six months), you get (1+1/2)2=€2.25(1 + 1/2)^2 = €2.25. Compounded four times (25% each quarter), (1+1/4)4≈€2.44(1 + 1/4)^4 \\approx €2.44. As you compound more and more often, the result keeps growing but never explodes. It settles toward a specific value. Remember, the value a sequence settles toward is its limit, the number the terms keep getting closer to without overshooting. The limit of (1+1/n)n(1 + 1/n)^n as nn grows toward infinity is e≈2.71828...e \\approx 2.71828...\n\nLike π\\pi, no fraction equals ee exactly. Both sit in gaps between rationals, just like 2\\sqrt{2}. The reals fill all of these gaps at once.\n\nThe reals filled every hole on the number line. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square roots of positive numbers all work.\n\nBut we've only tested square roots on positive numbers. Every previous operation eventually hit an input that broke the system. Does this one?\n\nTry 4=2\\sqrt{4} = 2. Fine. 0=0\\sqrt{0} = 0. Fine. Now try −1\\sqrt{-1}. What number, squared, gives −1-1?\n\nNo real number does. We saw earlier that the distributive law forces negative times negative to be positive, and squaring zero gives zero, so nothing in the reals has a negative square.\n\nSame pattern. A reasonable operation produces a result the system can't hold.\n\nExtend the system using pairs again. A complex number is a pair (a,b)(a, b) of real numbers, written a+bia + bi, where ii is defined by one rule: i×i=−1i \\times i = -1. Calling it \"imaginary\" is a historical accident, no more imaginary than negative numbers were when people first invented them.\n\nWhere does ii live? No real number squares to −1-1, so ii isn't on the number line. It's genuinely new. Since it's not to the left or right of any real number, put it off the line entirely, one unit above zero on a new vertical axis. Every complex number a+bia + bi is a point on this plane: aa tells you how far along the real line, bb how far along the ii axis. 3+2i3 + 2i sits 3 units right and 2 units up. A one-dimensional line became a two-dimensional plane, because the new object didn't fit on the old line.\n\nAll the arithmetic rules from before still apply. The only new fact is i×i=−1i \\times i = -1. Everything else follows.\n\nWatch what multiplying by ii does. Start at 1 on the real axis. 1×i=i1 \\times i = i, one unit up. i×i=−1i \\times i = -1, one unit left. −1×i=−i-1 \\times i = -i, one unit down. −i×i=−(i×i)=1-i \\times i = -(i \\times i) = 1, back where you started. Four multiplications, a full loop.\n\nSplit a full circle into 360 degrees. Four equal steps make 360, so each step is 90 degrees. Multiplying by ii rotates a point 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n\nTwo multiplications rotate 90+90=18090 + 90 = 180 degrees, from 1 to −1-1. That's i2=−1i^2 = -1, two quarter-turns. The operation that seemed impossible on the number line becomes a rotation in the plane.\n\n3−5=?3 - 5 = ? had no natural number. 1÷31 \\div 3 had no integer. x2=2x^2 = 2 had no rational. x2=−1x^2 = -1 had no real. Each time we expanded the system. But what about x3−2x+5=0x^3 - 2x + 5 = 0? Expressions like these (adding, subtracting, multiplying a variable by constants, raising to whole-number powers) are polynomials. The complex numbers settle all of them. Every non-constant polynomial (non-constant just means \"not a plain number\") with complex coefficients (the numbers in front of each power of xx) has at least one complex root. Equivalently, over C\\mathbb{C}, you can break any such polynomial into linear factors. That doesn't mean every polynomial has a simple radical formula, but it does mean roots exist in C\\mathbb{C}.\n\nEvery number system followed one cycle:\n\nEach system nests inside the next like concentric rings, with the naturals at the center and each expansion adding a ring around the previous ones.\n\nThe cycle repeats across all five systems.\n\nThe naturals couldn't subtract, so we built the integers. The integers couldn't divide, so we built the rationals. The rationals had holes, so we built the reals. The reals couldn't handle all square roots, so we built the complex numbers.\n\nEach system contains all the previous ones: naturals inside integers, inside rationals, inside reals, inside complex numbers. Nothing is lost, and each step adds something new.\n\nDivision by zero never gets fixed while keeping the usual field laws. If a/0=xa / 0 = x and division is still inverse to multiplication, then a=0×x=0a = 0 \\times x = 0 for every aa, collapsing the distinction between all numbers. (There are alternative algebraic systems that assign values to division by zero, but they give up familiar rules.)\n\nThe expansion doesn't stop at C\\mathbb{C} either. Quaternions (four-dimensional) and octonions (eight-dimensional) go further. But each extension costs something. Quaternions give up commutativity (a×b≠b×aa \\times b \\neq b \\times a), octonions give up associativity ((a×b)×c≠a×(b×c)(a \\times b) \\times c \\neq a \\times (b \\times c)). The pattern continues, but the price gets steeper.\n\nEvery number you use today exists because an earlier system couldn't handle some operation, and someone decided to build a new one rather than accept the limitation.",

The panel below will update to show:\n\nSteerling is built on a causal discrete diffusion model backbone, which lets us steer generation across multi-token tokens rather than only at the next-token.\nThe key design choice is decomposing the model’s embeddings into three explicit pathways: ~33K supervised “known” concepts, ~100K “discovered” concepts the model learns on its own, and a residual that captures whatever remains.\n\nWe then constrain the model with training loss functions that ensure the model routes signal through concepts without a fundamental tradeoff with performance.\nThe concepts feed into logits through a linear path, every prediction decomposes exactly into per-concept contributions, and we can edit those contributions at inference time without retraining.\nFor the full architecture, training objectives, and scaling analysis, see Scaling Interpretable Models to 8B.\n\nDespite being trained on significantly fewer compute than comparable models, Steerling-8B achieves competitive performance across standard benchmarks. The figure below shows average performance (across 7 benchmarks) versus approximate training FLOPs on a log scale, with vertical lines marking multiples of Steerling’s compute budget.\n\nIn the previous update, we shared several ways that assess how interpretable a model’s representations are.\nHere we provide another metric that gives insight into the model’s use of its concepts. On a held-out validation set, over 84% of token-level contribution comes from the concept module: the model is not just using the residual to make its predictions.\nThis matters for control: if the model’s predictions genuinely flow through concepts, then editing those concepts at inference time actually changes what the model does rather than nudging a side channel while the real work happens elsewhere.\n\nA useful check is what happens when we remove the residual pathway. On several LM Harness tasks, dropping the residual has only a small effect, which suggests the model’s predictive signal is largely routed through concepts rather than hidden “everything-else” channels.\n\nFinally, Steerling can detect known concepts in text with 96.2% AUC on a held-out validation dataset.\n\nIn the coming weeks, we’ll be releasing deep dives on each of these capabilities:\n\nWe’ll cover each of these in detail in upcoming posts, with quantitative evaluations and deployment-oriented case studies.",

    "fullText": "A fiscal note on the proposed Chicago Bears stadium construction package shows northwest Indiana residents could pay millions in new taxes, which could grow with use by visitors to the region.\n\nThe statement — prepared by the nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency — still includes many unknowns but does provide some baseline revenue estimates for hospitality-related taxes.\n\nUnder Senate Bill 27, a state-crafted authority would take out bonds to build the stadium. A bevy of taxes would provide revenue to make the annual bond payments.\n\nThe exact cost of the project is unknown at this time though the Chicago Bears have committed $2 billion and House Speaker Todd Huston said Thursday in unveiling the plan that as much as $1 billion in public funding could be involved.\n\nThe bill allows Lake and Porter counties to each adopt a 1% food-and-beverage tax by June 30, 2027. Revenue from these taxes would go to the Northwest Indiana Stadium Board.\n\nIf both counties impose the 1% food-and-beverage tax, they could collect an estimated total of at least $12 million to $18 million annually, according to the fiscal estimate datedFriday. The estimate is based on the existing food services industry in each county and revenue collected in counties that currently impose such taxes.\n\nChicago Bears call Indiana deal ‘step forward’ for building new stadium in Hammond\n\n“The actual amount of revenue in Lake and Porter counties would likely be greater to the extent the stadium project results in increased demand for food and beverages,” it said.\n\nThe bill allows Lake County to increase the local hotel tax rate from its current 5% to 10%. The county council is required to adopt an ordinance increasing the tax rate by June 30, 2027.\n\nRevenue received from the hotel tax increase could be at least $5.4 million annually. But the statement says “the actual innkeeper’s tax revenue distributed to the board would likely be greater once the stadium and other facilities have been built.”\n\nHammond could also establish a 12% admissions tax on tickets for events held in the stadium. The tax is imposed on tickets offered for sale to the public at a box office or authorized agent, and does not apply to season tickets or a personal seat license.\n\nAll revenue collected would go to the Northwest Indiana Stadium Board to pay debt owed by the board.\n\nThe fiscal estimates the tax would generate around $12 million annually once the facility begins holding events. However, the revenue could be greater depending on the events that are held at the stadium.\n\nThe 10% Marion County admissions tax, which applies to events held at Lucas Oil Stadium, Victory Field, Gainbridge Fieldhouse and the Indiana Convention Center, generated $31.3 million during fiscal year 2025.\n\nAnother provision in the bill would create the Northwest Indiana Professional Sports Development Area. It could include any facility or complex of facilities that is used to hold a professional sporting event, including a stadium, parking garages, training facilities, and other related areas as specified in the bill.\n\nIt provides for allocation of covered taxes, including taxes paid for wages earned by athletes playing home games in a sporting facility, to the tax area. It defines covered taxes as state sales and use tax; individual income tax; local income tax; food and beverage taxes. Those revenues can be used for costs related to financing, construction, operating, maintaining and administration of the facilities established as part of the area.\n\nThe fiscal analysis said the total capture for the new tax area is unknown, but it will be less than the Marion County Professional Sports Development Area. That area — containing three sports facilities, a convention center and training facility — brings in over $16 million a year.\n\nOne final section of the bill allows dollars captured through a renegotiation of the Indiana Toll Road lease in 2026 to be used by the Indiana Finance Authority to pay or reimburse any costs associated with transportation and infrastructure projects in the following counties associated with the stadium relocation: Elkhart, LaGrange, Lake, LaPorte, Porter, Steuben and St. Joseph.\n\nAn information request with the IFA is currently pending concerning how much in revenue could be received from a renegotiation of the lease of the Indiana Toll Road, the fiscal report said.\n\nSenate Bill 27 is set for a second reading in the Indiana House on Monday and will be finalized by Friday, when this year’s legislative session is set to conclude.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",

    "fullText": "World Liberty Financial, the crypto firm cofounded and partly run by the Trump family, will tokenize loan revenue interest from a new Trump International Hotel and Resort in the Maldives.\n\nTokenization is the process of putting an asset on the blockchain to turn it into a crypto token that can be easily traded, in this case, a loan used to fund the construction of a hotel. Investors who buy tokenized pieces of the loan will be entitled to a portion of the interest payments made on it.\n\nAccording to WLF documents, DT Marks DEFI LLC, which is owned by the Trump family, reserves the right to receive 75% of the revenue generated from $WFLI token sales after expenses.\n\nThe offering won't be available to everyone. Only accredited investors, or those with at least $1 million in liquid assets and who make enough money per year, will be given access to the tokenized loan. The tokens will be offered in partnership with Securitize, Inc. and Dar Global PLC.\n\nThe Trump hotel in the Maldives is set to open in 2030 and was announced in late 2025.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is listed as \"Cofounder Emeritus\" of World Liberty Financial on its website. His three sons — Don Jr., Eric, and Baron — are listed as cofounders, as is Steve Witkoff, who is currently serving as United States special envoy to the Middle East.\n\nWorld Liberty Financial's new tokenization offering is the Trump family's latest move in the crypto space. In January 2025, Trump launched $Trump coin, a meme token that spiked to $45 shortly after launch, and currently trades at $3.40. According to Reuters, the coin made almost $100 million in fees in the first couple weeks after its launch.\n\nWLF also sold a 49% stake in January 2025 to an Emirati royal for $500 million, the Wall Street Journal reported. The firm launched a stablecoin, USD1, last March.\n\nIn addition, Trump Media and Technology Group adopted a crypto treasury strategy last year, buying billions of dollars in bitcoin. According to a Bloomberg report, crypto had boosted the Trump family's net worth by $1.4 billion as of January 2026.\n\nThe token offering from WLF comes as crypto assets endure a brutal bear market as funds flee the space. Bitcoin's price is down 45% from October's high, while ethereum has fallen 59% since August.",

    "description": "An interdisciplinary collaboration has developed a way to 3D-print concrete underwater – a technique that could transform on-site maritime construction and the repair of critical infrastructure.",
    "fullText": "Since it was invented in the 1980s, 3D printing has moved from the laboratory to the factory, the home and even outer space.\n\nNow, an interdisciplinary group of Cornell researchers is developing a way to bring the technology to the ocean. By 3D-printing concrete underwater, the new approach could transform on-site maritime construction and the repair of critical infrastructure that connects continents.\n\n“We want to be constructing without being disruptive,” said Sriramya Nair, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering in the David A. Duffield College of Engineering, who leads the effort. “If you have a remotely operated underwater vehicle that shows up on site with minimal disturbance to the ocean, then there is a way to build smarter and not continue the same practices that we do on the land.”\n\nThe project got its start in fall 2024, when the Department of Defense’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) issued a call for proposals to design 3D-printable concrete that could be deposited at a depth of several meters underwater – and to do so in a radically truncated timeframe of one year.\n\n“When the call for proposals came out, we said, ‘Hey, let’s just do this and see, so that we will at least understand what the challenges are,” said Nair, whose group had already been working with a roughly 6,000-pound industrial robot to 3D-print large-scale concrete structures. “And it turned out, with our mixture we could actually 3D-print underwater by making adjustments to account for continuous water exposure.”\n\nIn May 2025, the team was awarded a one-year, $1.4 million grant that is contingent on meeting certain benchmarks, with five other teams competing to do the same.\n\nUnderwater printing faces numerous challenges. Chief among them is preventing washout, in which cement particles fail to bind together during deposition, weakening the material. The typical solution is introducing admixture chemicals, but these create complications of their own.\n\n“When you add those chemicals, it makes your mixture really viscous, and you can’t pump. So you’re balancing that pumpability with these anti-washout agents,” Nair said. “When it extrudes, even if you don’t have washout, you still want it to be able to hold the shape and bond well with the other layers. There are multiple parameters at play.”\n\nDARPA added one more hurdle: The concrete needed to consist primarily of seafloor sediment and only include a small amount of cement. Incorporating material from the bottom of the ocean would minimize the logistical difficulty of transporting large quantities of cement by ship.\n\nIn September, the Cornell team successfully demonstrated to a group of visiting DARPA officials that they were getting close to meeting the agency’s high sediment target. It was a huge milestone, according to Nair.\n\n“Nobody is doing this right now,” she said. “Nobody takes seafloor sediment and prints with it. This is opening up a lot of opportunities for reimagining what concrete could look like.”\n\nThe complexity of underwater 3D printing requires a range of specialized knowledge, so Nair assembled an interdisciplinary group with two sub-teams, one for material design, the other fabrication. Collaborators include: Nils Napp, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering, Greg McLaskey, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering, and Uli Wiesner, the Spencer T. Olin Professor of Engineering, in materials science and engineering; Jenny Sabin, the Arthur L. and Isabel B. Weisenberger Professor in Architecture in the College of Architecture, Art and Planning; as well as researchers from University of Michigan, Clarkson University and University of Arizona.\n\nThe second phase of the DARPA challenge will culminate in a bake-off of sorts, with multiple teams 3D-printing an arch underwater, in March. For months, Nair’s team has been conducting test prints in a large tub of water – often producing multiple samples every week – in the Bovay Civil Infrastructure Laboratory Complex. The lab setting allows the researchers to closely monitor how the layers are deposited and the strength, shape and texture of each arch. But that kind of tactile assessment is only possible on dry land.\n\n“Let’s say you want to print underwater in the real world – we can’t send somebody down with a scuba suit, right? We have to be able to detect those things and adjust our tool path in real time,” Nair said. “The overall goal is to achieve good print quality, because if you don’t place your material where it needs to be, you’re not going to get the strength you need.”\n\nSo in lieu of scuba divers, the fabrication team set out to design sensors that can track the printing as it occurs. Marine conditions don’t make the process easy.\n\n“The problem is sediment is super fine, and as soon as you stir it up, you can have zero visibility,” said Napp, who specializes in building and programming mechatronic devices that navigate and modify unstructured environments. “We didn’t know how much turbidity – or murkiness – there would be in the water.”\n\nSo Napp’s group designed a control box with multiple sensing systems that can be integrated with the robot arm. This device will be paired with Sabin’s work in robotics to bring greater autonomy and control to underwater concrete printing.\n\nThe DARPA competition’s final demonstration will be held in March, and the team is racing to incorporate the advances made by the fabrication team with those of the materials team to successfully print the arches.\n\nWhile the accelerated pace and high-pressure nature of the competition can be tough on the nerves, the urgency has helped make the team as productive as possible.\n\n“As soon as the grant was awarded, we were all meeting once a week, trying to make progress,” Napp said. “It’s a pretty ambitious timeline, and it’s cool to see so many different areas of expertise coming together quickly and pushing this forward.”",

    "description": "Jeff Mason, a former construction manager, and his wife faced financial ruin due to medical bills in the 1990s. Now, he drives for Uber at 76.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jeff Mason, 76, who drives for Uber in New Jersey for extra income. Mason and his wife liquidated their savings after his wife's cancer treatment, which she underwent before the Affordable Care Act's restrictions on insurance companies denying coverage to patients with pre-existing conditions. Over the last two decades, the couple has tried to financially recover. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAt age 10 in 1960, I started shoveling sidewalks and mowing lawns. I used to cut a lawn for 25 cents. I worked at a produce market, washed dishes, and worked in retail while growing up. My mother was sick for a few years and died when I was a senior in high school. I went to prep school for a year and then college for a year, but I quit to become a caregiver to my younger siblings. I chauffeured my brothers and sisters around for a few years before going back to college.\n\nMy father owned a construction company, and I worked summers for him. I moved from being a laborer to working with an engineering crew. I learned how to operate heavy equipment and large trucks, building bridges and highways. I also worked on wastewater treatment facilities and then moved into management. I did estimating and project management for a specialty construction company that worked on warehouses and loading docks.\n\nMy wife was a stay-at-home mom, but when our youngest daughter moved out, she decided she needed to do something more. She got a job for an environmental testing company.\n\nShe went to the family doctor, who determined she had the classic symptoms of a bad gallbladder. She had her first surgery and had to stay in the hospital for a few days. It wasn't until a few months later that the bills started coming in.\n\nOur son was getting married, and my wife's work was by choice instead of necessity. She voluntarily took a leave of absence and started to collect unemployment. We started to pay COBRA a little over $100 monthly to maintain her health insurance.\n\nA few months after that, she found a lump in her chest. We started to get bills from the doctors and the hospital. They told us we didn't have insurance. I said that we did. We were paying for COBRA, and I had all my canceled checks. She had surgery on her breast, but the hospital flat out told us that we don't have insurance. She was sent home a day after because we couldn't afford it.\n\nThe easiest way to understand what happened is that hypothetically, there were 300 employees at the company. We were paying 1/300 of a monthly premium. They weren't paying the other 299 parts of it. So even though the insurance company was taking our money, we weren't covered. They wanted me to go from me paying for my insurance and her paying for her insurance to essentially paying for four policies on one income. I had made too much to qualify for government assistance.\n\nWe went to a few lawyers, and each of them said we had no case because there was no intent on anybody's part to defraud us.\n\nI talked to one of the insurance companies that denied us, and they said we need to secure insurance for any other things that might happen, but she won't be covered for cancer treatments, as cancer is a pre-existing condition. Meanwhile, we didn't have any income coming in. The company said the only way she could get covered is if I divorced her, and she could collect welfare and get coverage.\n\nWe decided we were going to liquidate. We cashed in our IRA, sold our car, remortgaged our house, and emptied our savings. After a year, I started making monthly payments to everybody. We eventually ran out of money. It took me 13 years to pay off the second mortgage.\n\nI remembered getting a bill in the neighborhood of $246,000 from the hospital that covered the surgery and her recovery in the hospital. We still had a whole road ahead of us for aftercare. By the end of it, the bills totaled about $300,000. This all happened before the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe rebuilding process was slow. Our IRA was non-existent. I remember one day I came home and found my wife on the front porch crying because bill collectors were asking for more money. She never cried once through the treatments and the recoveries.\n\nOur credit was bad at that point. It took us a while to get a credit card. Our car broke down, and I was trying to work and had no way to get back and forth. I bought an inexpensive motorcycle, which I used to go back and forth on a construction site. Little by little, we built our credit back up.\n\nI worked 12-hour days during the week, a long half day on Saturdays, and pretty much every Sunday night. I also held side jobs. We started to put $10 away out of every paycheck. We lived very sparsely. We didn't spend any money. My wife didn't go to a hairstylist or buy makeup. We bought a home that was less expensive. I was also lucky to never have been laid off.\n\nWe've lived in the same three-bedroom house in New Jersey since 1988. From time to time, family members need a place to stay because of their situation. We've probably had 10 to 15 people live with us for months. This included my father, who spent his last five years here. Our house is known as the sanctuary. People come here to heal, whether mentally or physically.\n\nMy wife got involved in elder care after she went through that cancer situation, transporting people to and from the hospital. She made connections with people who had older parents or family members, and she started to take care of them on a part-time basis.\n\nI really didn't want to retire in my 60s, but we were getting older, and my wife wanted me to be spending more time at home. When I retired, I had some equity in my home and around $300,000 in my IRA. I also started to fund an IRA for my wife, which I built to mid-five figures. This allowed us to travel extensively within the US for the first few years. But a part of me felt like we probably weren't going to live that long anyway because everybody around us was dying.\n\nI was diagnosed with prostate cancer and have had several heart surgeries. I decided to loosen the purse strings and not worry so much about savings. In those years, we probably spent more than we should have.\n\nWe live on a 20-acre piece of land and are surrounded by nothing but woods. We live an isolated life and don't have many friends.\n\nI started driving for Uber to continue the lifestyle that we had while I was last working. I first aimed to make $100 a day. Some weeks now, I can make well above $600. I've had a few weeks over $1,000. I typically work nights and weekends. I haven't had to withdraw any money from an IRA since I started driving for Uber. The money anxiety started to go away.\n\nEven with my prostate cancer, pacemaker, and half a lung removed, my physical strength and stamina are remarkably good. As a mental challenge, I try to push myself in every situation I'm in. I find driving at night calming, and I like the aloneness of it. Driving bolsters the self-sufficiency aspect of my life, and I get to meet the denizens of the dark, who are often more interesting.\n\nWe both would like to leave something for our children, even though they are pretty well off. We don't know what their lives are going to be in 10 years.\n\nI think about how long I'll be able to drive. I know that if I retire today, we'll be able to make it work and could possibly remortgage our house. But everything is getting more expensive. Our children check up on us and want us to move closer, and we know they'll have our back when we get older. But I'm not too worried about our future.",

    "description": "A federal judge is expected to rule in February 2026 on whether the construction can continue.",
    "fullText": "The construction of U.S. President Donald Trump’s White House ballroom was halted by a federal judge in mid-February 2026.\n\nAs of this writing, a federal judge has yet to rule on the legal status of the construction project. In a social media post, Trump stated that the project is moving \"ahead of schedule,\" while a White House spokesperson told us that the project is still in the \"demolition phase.\"\n\nA social media rumor that emerged around Feb. 10, 2026, claimed a federal judge had halted U.S. President Donald Trump's White House ballroom construction project.\n\nTrump began the demolition of the White House's East Wing in October 2025 in order to replace it with a 90,000-square-foot ballroom. In December 2025, the nonprofit National Trust for Historic Preservation sued the administration, arguing the project began without necessary approvals or congressional authority.\n\nIn mid-February 2026, numerous readers asked us to confirm whether a federal judge had halted construction on the ballroom. A Feb. 10 Facebook post stated:\n\nTrump's infamous new White House ballroom and bunker has been scrapped by a federal judge and the national trust preservation committee. It was also discovered the $400 million in ballroom donor money has either disappeared or simply never existed. 🤔\n\nThe image of the White House (below) shows the former site of the East Wing, built in 1902 and renovated in 1942, completely demolished with several bulldozers and skip loaders clearing the last of the rubble.\n\nGSA has to now hire a construction company to fill the east wing (trump improperly had demolished) with dirt and sod. The Judge and committee have also ruled trump \"cannot as much as paint a wall in the white house without a permit and committee approval\".\n\nAs of this writing, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon, the judge overseeing the case, had yet to issue a decision on the status of the ballroom construction project. We reached out to the White House; a spokesperson told us the ballroom was not yet being constructed and the project was still in the \"demolition stage.\"\n\nWe therefore rate the claim that a judge has halted the construction as false. We will update the story when the court releases a decision.\n\nThe National Trust argued that the project proceeded without receiving authorization from Congress and with inadequate environmental assessments.\n\nOn Dec. 17, 2025, Leon denied the National Trust's motion for a temporary restraining order on the project and temporarily allowed work to continue. The judge's order noted that because the ballroom plans had not been finalized, there was no \"imminent risk of irreparable aesthetic harm.\"\n\nAccording to arguments filed by the Trump administration in January 2026, previous presidents did not require congressional approval to carry out construction or renovations on White House grounds. The government also said above-ground construction would not begin until April 2026.\n\nIn late January 2026, Leon expressed skepticism that the administration had the legal authority to tear down the East Wing and proceed with construction. However, he said he would make a decision in the coming weeks, likely in February 2026, on whether or not to allow a preliminary injunction, which would stop the construction work for the duration of the case.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg's reporting, Leon predicted the issue would also be appealed to a federal appeals court and possibly the Supreme Court. According to court records viewed on Feb. 12, Leon had not issued such an injunction.\n\nThe White House didn't specify how much money it had raised and who the private donors were, directing us to Trump's most recent statement instead. On Feb. 10, 2026, Trump posted on TruthSocial that the construction project \"is on budget, and ahead of schedule.\" He also shared digital renderings of what the potential ballroom would look like.\n\nOn Jan. 25, Trump posted that the project was privately funded and would cost $300 million to $400 million dollars:\n\nI'm building, on top of everything else that I am doing, one of the greatest and most beautiful Ballrooms anywhere in the World, with more than 300 Million Dollars of Great American Patriots' money, and working closely with, right from the beginning, the United States Military and Secret Service. This is a GIFT (ZERO taxpayer funding!) to the United States of America, of 300 to 400 Million Dollars (depending on the scope and quality of interior finishes!), for a desperately needed space [...]\n\nIn November 2025, the White House released a list of donors for the ballroom project, which included charitable organizations, sports team owners, tech companies, media companies and billionaires. The Associated Press reported an additional corporation as well as an artificial intelligence chipmaker that also donated to the project. The administration did not reveal how much each donor contributed.\n\nSnopes has covered numerous claims on the East Wing demolition and Trump's plans for a White House ballroom.\n\n\"A Crane Used in the Ballroom Construction Hovers above The White...\" Getty Images, 10 Feb. 2026, https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/crane-used-in-the-ballroom-construction-hovers-above-the-news-photo/2260298495.

    "fullText": "The seal, which is made of a light brown gemstone, is thought by archaeologists to have been “hung like a necklace around its owner’s neck,” and decoratively divided into three.\n\nA stone seal believed to have been used by a high-ranking administrative official during the time of the Kingdom of Judah in the late 8th century BC was discovered by the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) during excavations in northern Israel.\n\nThe dig was led by archaeologists Dr. Amir Gorzalczany and Gerald Finklestein. The IAA shared the find in a Wednesday post to social media, adding that the excavations had taken place as part of the construction of the Ein Tut Interchange.\n\nThe seal, made of a light brown gemstone, is thought by archaeologists to have been “hung like a necklace around its owner’s neck” and is decoratively divided into three parts.\n\nFour pomegranates are carved into the upper section of the seal, while the other two sections contain an ancient Hebrew inscription reading: “Belonging to Makhach (son of) Amihai,” the IAA explained.\n\n“The importance of the seal derives both from its contribution to the treasury of biblical names, and from the fact that, unlike most seals of its type, this seal's origin is from an organized archaeological excavation and not from antiquities collectors,” the late archaeologist David Amit had said of the discovery.\n\nAmit deciphered the inscription alongside Dr. Esther Eshel of Bar-Ilan University.\n\nPieces of jar handles bearing royal seals were also found at the site, impressed with the words “Belonging to the King” and the names of Hebron and the ancient city Ziph, two important administrative cities at the end of the First Temple period.\n\n\"Such seal impressions are a common find at biblical sites in the Judah region,” Gorzalczany said of the findings. “However, their presence at a site so northern, deep within the territories of the biblical Kingdom of Israel, is most surprising.”",

    "description": "A new 6,456-square-foot Braum’s store under construction at NW 192nd Street and N Western Avenue in Oklahoma City is valued at $2.5 million.",
    "fullText": "Oklahoma City residents may have driven by the intersection of north Western Avenue and NW 192nd Street and wondered what’s being constructed there.\n\nBraum’s in January 2025 filed a permit at 1021 NW 192nd Street to build what will be one of the larger stores in its footprint.\n\nAccording to permits filed with the City of Oklahoma City, Braum’s is building a nearly 6,500-square-foot store. It’s a job with an estimated value of $2.5 million, the permit shows.\n\nThere are 326 Braum's stores in the U.S. as of Feb. 11, and Oklahoma has 146 of them, or about 45% of all locations nationally, data provided by the company.\n\nWith most Braum’s stores ranging from 5,500-6,500 square feet, the location being built on 192nd Street would be one of the largest in Oklahoma.\n\nThe Express Star reported in 2021 that Braum’s opened the largest location in Oklahoma at 3001 S. Sara Rd. The report states that location is just under 6,500 square feet, with seating for about 70 guests and an outdoor covered patio that accommodates roughly 40 patrons.\n\nThe 192nd Street location is of comparable size at 6,456 square feet.\n\nBraum’s leadership, according to reports, has increased the size of new stores since the 2000s to accommodate their expanded Fresh Market grocery sections, which feature wider aisles and an increased variety of product options.\n\nThe markets inside the stores are among the qualities that separate the brand from other fast-food options.\n\nThe layout seen in Yukon and in Wolfforth, Texas, dedicates more than 1,600 square feet to the market area alone. Both of those locations have 16.5-foot ceilings, the largest in the company’s footprint.\n\nBraum's Public Relations Director Amanda Beuchaw said the new store in Oklahoma City will be the same store model as seen in Yukon and just outside of Lubbock, Texas.\n\n\"The (store size) mostly has to do with the lot size,\" Beuchaw said. \"If the lot is big enough to support it, they love to use the big model as much as they can because they really like the look and aesthetic of that model. But it has to do with the lot being able support that size of a store as well as the parking lot and the spaces needed.\"\n\nBeuchaw said the company hopes to open the new location sometime before June 2026, but that will ultimately depend on weather and material delays, among other factors.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Oklahoman: Oklahoma City's new Braum's store will be one of the largest in the state",

    "fullText": "Six US states are pushing legislation to put a moratorium on artificial intelligence (AI) data center construction.\n\nYahoo Finance Breaking Business News Reporter Jake Conley joins Market Domination Overtime host Josh Lipton to outline the details of these bills and the potential ramifications down the road.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime.\n\nWhich states are pushing back and why are they pushing back?\n\nYeah, Josh, you've got six states with bills being considered right now. You've got Oklahoma, Vermont, and Maryland, but also three major hubs, New York, Georgia, and Virginia, home to Data Center alley in the Lowden area.\n\nThose back three have been huge sites of development. These bills are structured in a few different ways, but the basic underlying principle\n\nis that they look to put a moratorium on data center development. Essentially saying from roughly one year to a roughly three-year window,\n\nyou cannot develop here, you cannot build here until certain hurdles are met or until we get a pipeline cleaned up of requests or ex-conditions are met.\n\nBut essentially this is saying to those developers, these states, if these bills pass, will be walled off to you.\n\nAnd the the real argument here is infrastructure strain. These data centers suck up a lot of energy. They suck up a lot of water. That's going to put pressure on rate payers bills. You already see electricity bills hiking in these areas that have had a lot of development.\n\nYou see water strain in those areas. The grid is under a lot of stress. And so lawmakers are now trying to get ahead of that and saying, wait, wait, wait, slow down. Let's get some stuff on the books, get some regulations in place. But to do that, we want a breather.\n\nWhat what are the chances uh that these bills actually do pass, Jake?\n\nThey're going to face an uphill battle for a few reasons. You got to remember these data centers bring jobs. They bring tax revenue.\n\nAlso, the companies that are behind these centers, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, these aren't easy to push aside. These are companies with real political heft and firepower, with real pressure. And a lot of these governors are at least nominally pro-development.\n\nSo the argument they're going to come up against from these data center developers is, hey, we're bringing you jobs. We're bringing you revenue. Why would you stop us from building? And they're going to face that same kind of push back from business interests, business lobby.\n\nEven if these bills don't go through, you could still see and probably still will see some kind of regulation, cost sharing agreements, water usage parameters. But the focus right now because of their top line impact is on these moratoriums.\n\nHow much, Jake final question, could this all sort of disrupt the great AI ambitions and dreams of Big Tech?\n\nI think the rule with the hyper scales right now is speed, right? There's an arms race going on. You see these companies spending hundreds of billions of dollars on building out this infrastructure. And the game here right now for for Microsoft, for Google, for all these companies building these out is speed.\n\nHow fast can we get these things put up to power the compute that we're trying to put into the market. Any kind of delay there is going to hurt those companies and slow them down.\n\nI was talking to someone today who works in site selection advising these companies on where to go. She was telling me you're already seeing people inside these companies take a second look at some of these spots and say maybe that's not the right idea. Maybe we go somewhere\n\nwith less laws on the rest proposals on the books. The problem is those areas have less infrastructure. So you're going to run into problems wherever you go.\n\nBut regardless, especially in these kind of bigger sites, bigger states where a lot of this development is happening, when the rule of speed, anything that's going to slow speed down is going to be detrimental.\n\nAll right, big story. Thank you Jake for covering it. Appreciate it. Thanks.",

    "fullText": "Organizers in Monterey Park took inspiration from other US cities to fight against the construction of a giant datacenter\n\nWhen a southern California city council proposed building a giant datacenter the size of four football fields last December, five residents vowed to stop it.\n\nThrough a frenetic word-of-mouth campaign, the small group raised awareness about the proposed facility in Monterey Park, a small city east of Los Angeles known affectionately as the country’s first suburban Chinatown.\n\nNo Data Center Monterey Park organizers – working in tandem with the grassroots racial justice group San Gabriel Valley (SGV) Progressive Action – held a teach-in and rally that drew hundreds of participants, knocked on doors, and distributed flyers on busy streets.\n\nThey emphasized how the computer systems facility would strain the power grid, drive up energy rates and create noise pollution. A petition quickly amassed nearly 5,000 signatures. All the materials were shared in English, Chinese and Spanish – a concerted effort to reach Monterey Park’s diverse populace, which is two-thirds Asian and one-quarter Hispanic.\n\nIn just six weeks, the community won. City leaders issued a 45-day moratorium on datacenter construction and a pledge to explore a permanent ban.\n\n“It’s like the third act of an Oscar-winning movie,” said Steven Kung, a co-founder of No Data Center Monterey Park.\n\nOver the past year, homegrown revolts against datacenters have united a fractured nation, animating local board meetings from coast to coast in both farming towns and middle-class suburbs. Local communities delayed or cancelled $98bn worth of projects from late March 2025 to June 2025, according to research from the group Data Center Watch, which has been tracking opposition to the sites since 2023. More than 50 active groups across 17 states targeted 30 projects during that time period, two-thirds of which were halted.\n\nThe movement against these facilities has even made for strange bedfellows, bringing together nimbys and environmentalists in Virginia, “Stop the Steal” activists and Democratic Socialists of America organizers in Michigan.\n\n“There’s no safe space for datacenters,” said Miquel Vila, lead analyst at Data Center Watch, a research project run by AI security company 10a Labs. “Opposition is happening in very different communities.”\n\nDatacenters have exploded in states with abundant land, cheap power and generous tax breaks. Though the facilities power everything from streaming services to artificial intelligence, functioning as an engine for our digital lives, few people seem to want these sites that drain enormous amounts of water and energy, causing energy costs to soar. A November Morning Consult poll found that a majority of voters support banning datacenter construction near where they live and say “AI datacenters” are partly responsible for rising electricity prices.\n\nVila said a spike in media coverage from national outlets, particularly of protests in the north-east and midwest, had helped consolidate local campaigns against datacenters into a movement. The proliferation of the centers “has become a hot topic at a national level, which reinforces local dynamics”, Vila said.\n\nIn Indiana, a datacenter hub with more than 70 facilities, local communities are fighting another 50 projects and have halted at least a dozen in the past year, according to data from Citizens Action Coalition, an Indianapolis-based consumer and environmental advocacy non-profit.\n\n“It’s like a revolt in the heartland,” said Bryce Gustafson, who organizes with the Citizens Action Coalition. “There’s an unbelievable amount of pushback, bipartisan and non-partisan, against these datacenters.”\n\nThe datacenter rebellion in the Republican stronghold of Indiana, he said, was built in part on a strong backlash in recent years against solar projects on farmland that many residents felt threatened the state’s rural character. The same concerns over land privatization and tech overreach carried over to the fight against datacenters, as conservatives and environmentalists joined forces to organize town halls, conduct canvassing training and file lawsuits to block developments.\n\n“For many Hoosiers, datacenters have become a physical manifestation of their mistrust of big tech, the elected officials who have embraced them, and the system that allows all this to happen,” Gustafson said.\n\nLocal fights against AI infrastructure have even begun to turn the tide at the state and federal levels as the midterms approach. In Virginia – the datacenter capital of the world with more than 600 facilities – the newly elected governor, Abigail Spanberger, campaigned on lowering utility bills by ensuring that AI companies are paying “their fair share” of electricity costs rather than passing them on to consumers. The progressive lawmakers Bernie Sanders and Rashida Tlaib have publicly backed calls for a datacenter moratorium. GOP leaders, including the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, and Missouri senator Josh Hawley, have also introduced bills to regulate AI.\n\nIn Monterey Park, concerns over the proposed datacenter are primarily about its economic, environmental and public health impact. The facility would employ 14 on-site diesel generators, which researchers said produce “ambient air pollutants”, such as nitrogen oxide, that are linked to a host of respiratory illnesses, including asthma and lung cancer.\n\nOrganizer Hrag Balian said No in Data Center Monterey Park took inspiration from other communities’ organizing, including protests in Virginia and Pennsylvania that have stalled projects. “None of us had experience doing this, so seeing patterns and parallels have been tremendously helpful.”\n\nKung said a core tenet of the group’s organizing strategy was building coalitions with different community organizations in the greater San Gabriel Valley area, such as SGV Progressive Action, Asian Youth Center and Montebello Teachers Association. All these community groups mobilized their own members to show up and testify at the January city council meeting. “It’s a decentralized movement,” Kung said.\n\nAndrew Yip, a community organizer with SGV Progressive Action who helped create flyers and organize rallies, said the campaign succeeded because residents were able to put aside their differences and rally around a single cause: halting a development that would affect their livelihoods.\n\n“This is about community members rising to the occasion to look out for one another,” Yip said.\n\nFor Monterey Park organizers, the fight is far from over. Rather than gutting the proposed facility themselves, city council members are considering placing the decision before voters on the November ballot. Kung said the move would put the onus on residents to develop a “long, drawn-out awareness campaign” about datacenters for the remainder of the year. In the meantime, the organizers have continued to engage new neighbors, gather signatures for the petition, and show up at council meetings.\n\n“We won a victory, but there’s still a lot of work to do,” Kung said.",

    "fullText": "CHICAGO — Shortly after his arrest in early October, Little Village construction worker Juan Espinoza Martinez was led by three federal agents into a windowless interview room, still dressed in a green work T-shirt and carrying a small bottle of water.\n\n“You’re probably a little confused about what’s going on today, so I’m gonna try to explain it all to you,” Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Christopher Perugini told Espinoza Martinez at the outset of the Oct. 6 videotaped interview, which was played for a federal jury Wednesday. “Feel free to ask me any questions you want.”\n\nThen, the agents laid it on Espinoza Martinez, a 37-year-old father of three, why he was there.\n\n“Murder for hire?” Espinoza responded, holding up his hands questioningly.\n\n“Correct, so that’s what the charge you’re charged with,” Perugini said. “I’ll explain it to you as we’re going.”\n\nThe agents then confronted Espinoza Martinez with text messages he’d sent an acquaintance that included a photo of Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, who was then the face of Operation Midway Blitz, along with what agents characterized as cash bounties for Bovino’s kidnapping and murder.\n\nOver the course of the interview, the agents pressed Espinoza Martinez repeatedly on how he thought the messages looked. He said over and over he meant nothing by it, that they were nothing more than social media chatter, and that he had no intention of making any actual offer for Bovino’s killing.\n\n“I’m really confused about this,” Espinoza said at one point in the interview. “I have no gang affiliation…I’m not nowhere around there. I work for a living every day. I’m a union worker. I work concrete, so I don’t know.”\n\nPortions of the videotaped interview were played for jurors in court Wednesday as the trial of Espinoza Martinez got underway before U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow.\n\nEspinoza Martinez, who has lived in Chicago for years but is not a U.S. citizen, is charged in an indictment with a single count of solicitation of murder for hire, which carries up to 10 years in prison.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Espinoza Martinez told an acquaintance from the construction business, Adrian Jimenez, after an immigration agent shot a woman in Chicago’s Brighton Park neighborhood on Oct. 4 “that he had dispatched members of the Latin Kings” to the area of 39th Street and Kedzie Avenue in response to the shooting.\n\nJimenez, who had worked as a government informant on and off for years, called up Homeland Security and shared the Snapchat messages that Espinoza Martinez had sent him saying, “2k on information when you get him” and “10k if u take him down,” along with Bovino’s photo, according to prosecutors.\n\nIn his opening statement to the jury, Assistant U.S. Attorney Minje Shin said the case was not about someone charged with “expressing strong, even angry, views about immigration enforcement policy” or a hatred of Bovino.\n\n“Make no mistake – the evidence in this case will show that what the defendant did was not a joke, not just mouthing off, not just him blowing off steam behind a keyboard, not political discourse … what the defendant did was a solicitation of murder,” Shin said.\n\nShin said Espinoza Martinez was “fixated” on Bovino, who was “the face of the threat” to arrest, detain, and deport members of his community in Little Village, a threat that “hit close to home.”\n\nEspinoza Martinez’s attorney, Jonathan Bedi, told the jurors in his opening remarks that the case was “riddled” with reasonable doubt because “the government cannot point to anything that shows Juan’s intent.”\n\n“When you cut through all of their words…all they have is their guesses and speculation,” Bedi said. “They are guessing.”\n\nBedi says there were no bags of money, no follow up, no recordings, no discussion of any plans. No location scouting, no escape route, no surveillance, no communication saying “Bovino’s here now would be a good time to act.”\n\n“Repeating neighborhood gossip is not a federal crime,” he said.\n\nBefore the Espinoza Martinez’s taped interview was played, jurors heard testimony from the informant, Jimenez, who walked slowly into court with a pronounced limp from a back issue he’s been suffering.\n\nDressed in a blue suit, with a salt-and-pepper beard, Jimenez said he’s been in construction for decades and recently started his own construction business. He also was convicted in 2000 of a felony and spent several years in prison.\n\nThough the jury did not hear details of that case, court records show Jimenez’s conviction was for an armed robbery and home invasion in Franklin Park that was charged in 2000. He was later sentenced to six years behind bars.\n\nJimenez told the jury he’s known Espinoza Martinez for “less than a year.” The defendant first reached out to him on Snapchat, looking for construction work, he said.\n\nJimenez testified he took photos of the Snapchat messages received from Espinoza Martinez on Oct. 2 and “almost immediately” contacted agents with HSI about them.\n\nJimenez testifies he had conversations about immigration with Espinoza Martinez “more than a few times.”\n\nBut when Shin attempted to ask what they talked about specifically, the defense repeatedly objected and the judge sustained it.\n\nOn cross-examination, defense attorney Dena Singer asked Jimenez a series of questions: You have a family, right? You work? You want to continue working and you want to continue staying in the U.S.? And you take care of your kids?\n\nJimenez answered “Yes” to all of them.\n\n“And you’re not somebody who commits murder-for-hire, right?” Singer asked,\n\nSinger also got Jimenez to acknowledge that Espinoza Martinez never asked him to take any action against Bovino or share the message with any wider audience.\n\nDid he ever say “Here’s where Bovino is going to be next?” Singer asked.\n\n“Did he ever say “Here’s a picture of cash,” or “I have someone who can pay you all this cash?'”\n\nEspinoza Martinez’s trial is the first criminal case to stem from Operation Midway Blitz to go to trial.\n\nThough limited in scope, the case is expected to offer an important litmus test as immigration-enforcement operations continue to roil Chicago and other Democrat-led cities long targeted by President Donald Trump, including Minneapolis, where the killing of a U.S. citizen by an immigration agent earlier this month has sparked nationwide protests.\n\nThe case was held up by top Department of Homeland Security officials as an example of the violence and threats immigration agents were facing from gang members and even international drug cartels.\n\nIn the months since, however, evidence of Espinoza Martinez’s supposed gang affiliations has not materialized. Prosecutors vastly toned down that aspect of the case, first dropping mention of gang affiliation in the indictment handed up by a grand jury, then saying in a pretrial hearing they only intended to prove Espinoza Martinez had an “affinity” for the Latin Kings.\n\nOn Tuesday, the defense objected to prosecutors introducing a text string where Espinoza Martinez told an unidentified contact: “It’s going down bro my guys are ready in the vill (Little Village). Saints sd and 2Six being bitches. Kings on they ass n they scared.”\n\nProsecutors argued the conversation showed Espinoza Martinez was disappointed other gangs weren’t fighting back.\n\nBut Lefkow sided partially with the defense, saying the comments on Little Village can be shown to the jury, but not the references to the Latin Saints or Two-Six gangs.\n\nShe also excluded later text by Espinoza Martinez about “Chapo” having the Latin Kings’ back — a reference to former Sinaloa Cartel boss Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.",

    "description": "The AI boom is threatening white-collar entry jobs—but it’s creating a booming six-figure opportunity for electricians, plumbers, and construction workers.",
    "fullText": "The job market has been a tough sell for many Gen Z graduates, with tariffs, economic uncertainty, and artificial intelligence reshaping hiring plans across corporate America. But according to Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang, the next wave of six-figure opportunities won’t be found in a Wall Street cubicle or Silicon Valley Slack channel. Instead, high-paying careers will partially come by picking up a wrench—literally.\n\nAs tech giants race to build sprawling data centers—totaling $7 trillion in global capital outlays by the end of the decade—Huang believes the world is on the cusp of what he calls the “largest infrastructure buildout in human history,” which will create “a lot of jobs.”\n\n“It’s wonderful that the jobs are related to tradecraft, and we’re going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steelworkers,” he said in conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nThe hands-on skills needed to construct what he described as chip, computer, and AI factories are already facing shortages—even though many roles pay over $100,000 without requiring a college degree. One McKinsey report estimated that between 2023 and 2030, there will be a need for an additional 130,000 trained electricians—as well as 240,000 construction laborers and 150,000 construction supervisors—in the U.S. alone.\n\n“Everybody should be able to make a great living,” Huang said. “You don’t need to have a Ph.D. in computer science to do so.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time Huang has expressed his optimistic outlook on new career paths emerging alongside AI.\n\n“The skilled craft segment of every economy is going to see a boom,” he told Channel 4 News in the U.K. last year. “You’re going to have to be doubling and doubling and doubling every single year.”\n\nThat optimism stands in contrast to warnings from leaders like Ford CEO Jim Farley, who has repeatedly cautioned that AI is hollowing out traditional white-collar entry points—just as the education system continues to funnel students toward four-year degrees.\n\n“There’s more than one way to the American Dream, but our whole education system is focused on four-year [college] education,” Farley said at the Aspen Ideas Festival last year. “Hiring an entry worker at a tech company has fallen 50% since 2019. Is that really where we want all of our kids to go? Artificial intelligence is gonna replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.”",

    "fullText": "Umarell (Italian spelling of the Bolognese Emilian word umarèl, Emilian pronunciation: [umaˈrɛːl]; plural umarî) are men of retirement age who spend their time watching construction sites, especially roadworks – stereotypically with hands clasped behind their back and offering unrequested advice to the workers.[1] Its literal meaning is \"little man\" (also umaréin).[2] The term is employed as lighthearted mockery or self-deprecation.\n\nThe modern term was popularised in 2005 by local writer Danilo Masotti[3][4] through three books and an associated blog.[5][6] The word was included in the Italian Zingarelli dictionary in 2021[7][8][9][10][11] and in 2024 was included by Language Council of Sweden in the annual list of new Swedish words – the Språkrådets nyordslista [sv].[12][13]\n\nIn 2015, the city of Riccione, approximately 130 kilometres (80 miles) southeast of Bologna, allocated an €11,000 budget to pay a wage to umarells to oversee worksites in the city – counting the number of trucks in and out to ensure materials were delivered/removed according to the receipts, and guarding against theft when the site was otherwise unattended.[14] The town of San Lazzaro di Savena, 6 km (3+1⁄2 mi) to the South-East of Bologna, awarded the \"Umarell of the year\" prize to a local resident, Franco Bonini.[15][16]\n\nIn 2016, the local cultural association called Succede solo a Bologna (\"It only happens in Bologna\") released the \"Umarèl card\" as a fundraiser for continued restoration of the San Petronio church.[17][18] Separately, a mobile app called Umarells was released that tracked the location of ongoing roadworks and construction sites.[19][20] The fast food restaurant chain Burger King also \"hired\" several umarells as part of a social media marketing campaign promoting its increased presence in the country.[21]\n\nIn July 2017, the Bologna city council's \"consultative commission for street naming\" approved the naming of a public square to the East of the city centre in the Cirenaica district Piazzetta degli Umarells in recognition of the local fame of the concept and the name – noting with conscious irony that the square was under construction at the time.[22][23][24][25]\n\nIn April 2018, the public square was inaugurated by city councillor Matteo Lepore, the district president Simone Borsari, the \"lord of the umarells\" Franco Bonini, the stand-up comedian Maurizio Pagliari (Dulio Pizzocchi), and the writer Danilo Masotti.[26] A year later the street-sign for the square was stolen.[27]\n\nIn April 2020, the comic magazine Topolino dedicated an episode to the umarell Gerindo Persichetti.[28] In December 2020 in Pescara, the real estate developer Sarra installed windows to allow Umarells to observe three construction sites.[29][30] Since 2019, an annual calendar has been sold in Bologna newsstands. In 2021, a board game La Giornata dell’Umarell (An Umarell's Day) was released.[31]\n\nHaving officially entered the Swedish language in 2024,[13] in October 2025 the municipality of Karlskoga formally inaugurated \"Umarell benches\" (sv: umarell-bänkar) for locals to monitor the construction of a local bathhouse.[32][33]",

    "fullText": "A federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as President Donald Trump seeks to shut it down.\n\nAt the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Senior Judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not explain why it could not take action short of a complete stop to construction on Revolution Wind while it considers ways to mitigate its national security concerns. He said it also did not provide sufficient reasoning for its change in position.\n\nRevolution Wind has received all of its federal permits and is nearly 90% complete to provide power for Rhode Island and Connecticut.\n\nTrump says his goal is to not let any “windmills” be built. Three energy developers are challenging the administration’s freeze of their offshore wind projects in the federal courts this week.\n\nDanish energy company Orsted, Norwegian company Equinor, and Dominion Energy Virginia each sued to ask the courts to vacate and set aside the administration’s Dec. 22 order to freeze five big projects on the East Coast over national security concerns. Orsted’s hearing was first on its Revolution Wind project. Orsted said it will soon resume construction to deliver affordable, reliable power to the Northeast.\n\nThe administration did not reveal specifics about its national security concerns, but Trump said Friday while meeting with oil industry executives about investing in Venezuela that wind farms are “losers.” He said they lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds.\n\n“I’ve told my people we will not approve windmills,” Trump said. “Maybe we get forced to do something because some stupid person in the Biden administration agreed to do something years ago. We will not approve any windmills in this country.”\n\nThe Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution. Trump began reversing the country’s energy policies his first day in office with a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal. A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nThe Trump administration paused leases for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind. New York’s attorney general sued the Trump administration on Friday over Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind.\n\nRevolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both major offshore wind projects by Orsted. Rhode Island and Connecticut filed their own request in court to try to save Revolution Wind.\n\n“The law takes precedent over the political whims of one man, and we will continue to fight to make sure that remains the case,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.\n\nAt Monday's hearing, attorney Janice Schneider, representing Revolution Wind, said the stop work order came at a critical stage of construction, with the project nearly 90% built and weeks away from beginning to deliver power to the electric grid. She said the delay is costing more than $1.4 million per day, and a specialized vessel has just enough time now to install the remaining turbines before its contract is up at the site in February.\n\nSchneider said they take national security issues seriously, but the government has not shared more information about its concerns with their experts who have security clearances, or shared unclassified summaries.\n\n“We do think that this court should be very skeptical of the government’s true motives here,\" Schneider said, citing Trump's comments from Friday.\n\nDepartment of Justice attorney Peter Torstensen argued that national security is paramount and protecting against new risks identified in the classified materials outweighs any alleged irreparable harm to the developers.\n\nWork on the Revolution Wind project was previously paused on Aug. 22 for what the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said were national security concerns. A month later, Judge Lamberth ruled the project could resume, citing the irreparable harm to the developers and the demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits of their claim. Orsted is building it with Skyborn Renewables.\n\nWith four offshore wind projects still stalled, Hillary Bright, executive director of offshore wind advocacy group Turn Forward, said she's hopeful that they will prevail in court and that the administration will begin to understand \"the immense benefits that these nearly complete power sources can bring to our nation’s energy and national security.”\n\nEquinor owns Empire Wind. Its limited liability company, Empire Wind LLC, said the project faces “likely termination” if construction can’t resume by this Friday because the order disrupts a tightly choreographed construction schedule dependent on vessels with very limited availability. Its hearing is Wednesday.\n\n“I would like to think that offshore wind is, and will continue to be, part of an all-of-the-above energy solution, which our country desperately needs,” said Molly Morris, Equinor’s senior vice president overseeing Empire Wind.\n\nDominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, was the first to sue. It’s asking a judge to block the order, calling it “arbitrary and capricious” and unconstitutional. Its hearing is Friday.\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations. AP is solely responsible for all content.

And we are waiting for the investigation to understand what the specific cause was. At the moment, the information we have from the emergency services is it was a death caused by natural causes ... while he was on site,\" Varnier said.\n\nThe Milan Cortina Winter Olympics are scheduled for Feb. 6-22.\n\nThe construction site was not one overseen by Simico, the governmental company responsible for Olympic infrastructure, the company said in a statement expressing its condolences.\n\nCortina city officials said they were “deeply saddened and troubled by the death.’’\n\nCortina will host curling, sliding and women’s Alpine skiing.",
