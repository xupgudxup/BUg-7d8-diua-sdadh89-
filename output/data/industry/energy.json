    "fullText": "A Russian captain killed a crewman in an “entirely avoidable” collision with a US oil tanker in the North Sea, a court heard.\n\nCapt Vladimir Motin, 59, was on sole watch duty when his container ship collided into the Stena Immaculate, causing the death of Mark Angelo Pernia on March 10 last year.\n\nPernia had allegedly been working at the front of the Solong and died in the collision.\n\nOpening his Old Bailey trial on Tuesday, Tom Little KC, prosecuting, said the case involved the “entirely avoidable death” of the 38-year-old seaman Pernia.\n\nHe told jurors that the location of the Stena Immaculate would have been visible on the Solong’s radar display about 36 minutes before the vessels collided.\n\nMr Little said: “Despite an obvious collision course, the defendant did not deviate his vessel from its path and the impending catastrophe that lay ahead.\n\n“The defendant was responsible for navigating the ship, not only because he was the captain but because he was on sole watch duty at the time and ultimately, he did nothing, absolutely nothing, to avoid the collision.”\n\nMr Motin, from Primorsky, St Petersburg, is accused of manslaughter, Mr Little telling jurors that Pernia “would still be alive” if not for the Russian’s “grossly negligent” conduct.\n\nSolong, which was 130 metres long and weighed 7,852 gross tonnes, had departed Grangemouth in Scotland at 9.05pm on March 9 last year, bound for the port of Rotterdam.\n\nThe vessel, with a 14-strong crew, was carrying mainly alcoholic spirits and some hazardous substances, including empty but unclean sodium cyanide containers, the court was told.\n\nThe Stena Immaculate, with a crew of 23, was 183.2 metres long and was transporting more than 220,000 barrels of aviation fuel destined for the US military.\n\nIts engine was shut down on the evening of March 9. Restarting it would have taken about 30 to 45 minutes and about 35 minutes to manoeuvre away from an incoming ship, the court heard.\n\nThe two vessels crashed at about 9.47am on March 10, just over 12 hours after the Solong set off from Grangemouth.\n\nThe Solong had been travelling at just over 16 knots in the minutes before the collision and was going 15.2 knots on impact with no warning to the Stena Immaculate.\n\nPernia’s body has never been found.\n\nThe Solong was on a direct collision course for much longer than a matter of minutes, jurors were told.\n\nThe collision course was obvious when the tanker became visible to the naked eye and, before that, on computer equipment available to the defendant, Mr Little argued.\n\nMr Motin had a “constellation of information” telling him he needed to act but did the opposite and failed to avert the collision, the court heard.\n\nThere were a number of things the “highly trained” captain “could and should have done”, Mr Little said.\n\n“It is this gross breach of duty to the man he killed, and indeed to his own crew, that led inexorably to a death and to him being on trial before you at the Old Bailey,” the prosecutor said.\n\nMr Motin has denied manslaughter and the trial continues.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "An abrupt surge in oil prices could cause inflation to rise and spark volatility in markets. Brent on Tuesday jumped to the highest level since November.",
    "fullText": "Soaring oil prices. Hot inflation. Turmoil in markets.\n\nThat was a dire combination the US economy saw in the 1970s, but analysts say that the risks of another oil price shock — a situation where oil prices abruptly surge and set off a domino effect of negative consequences in markets and the economy —are on the rise as geopolitical conflict escalates.\n\nOil prices spiked in recent weeks as the US conducted its raid on Venezuela and threatened to take military action in Iran — two of the world's largest crude producers.\n\nMarch contracts for Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 10% in the last week, and jumped by as much as 3% to trade above $65 a barrel on Tuesday. It's the highest price for Brent since November.\n\nShould Brent oil hit $80 a barrel, that would probably constitute an oil price shock, according to José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\n\nIn that scenario, Torres said he believes bonds and stocks would sell off in tandem, as higher energy prices could stoke inflation, which could weigh on economic growth. Higher inflation could also mean the Fed has less room to cut interest rates down the line, a major catalyst that has pushed risk assets higher in the past year.\n\n\"Definitely there's risk for an oil price shock, especially with stocks coming up for three really robust years,\" Torres told Business Insider, referring to the back-to-back years of double-digit gains for the S&P 500.\n\nMatt Gertken, the chief geopolitical strategist at BCA Research, said that recent tensions in Iran have raised the odds of a \"massive global oil supply shock\" to around 40%. Should Iran's regime fall and conflict in the region increase, that could result in a \"significant loss\" in oil production around the region, he wrote in a note to clients this week.\n\n\"Global and US equities are exposed to a correction in the near term given overvalued and overbought conditions and escalating geopolitical risk at the moment,\" Gertken added.\n\nAnalysts at Deutsche Bank also flagged the risk of the market experiencing an oil shock this year.\n\n\"A positive supply shock to oil prices would materially impact inflation expectations and inflation risks,\" the bank wrote in a recent client note, calling the scenario a key risk to their economic outlook.\n\nJeff Currie, a longtime commodities strategist and the chief strategy officer of energy pathways at Carlyle, added that he believes there could be further upside risk to oil prices. He pointed to factors such as high demand for crude and \"quite high\" geopolitical risk, which could make oil more expensive.\n\n\"The situation in Venezuela, the impact on geopolitical risk is very large,\" Currie told CNBC last week. \"For oil importers, whether you're China, India, or Europe, the world got a lot more dangerous.\"",

    "fullText": "LONDON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Global oil trading houses have emerged as early winners in the race to control Venezuelan crude flows, getting ahead of U.S. energy majors wary of credit and legal risks and securing a potentially lucrative business opportunity in the country with the world's largest crude reserves.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said U.S. majors would invest billions of dollars in Venezuela to quickly rebuild its dilapidated oil sector following the U.S. ​capture of President Nicolas Maduro earlier in January. Trump met top oil executives at the White House on Friday as his administration outlines a long-term plan to raise $100 billion to boost Venezuelan oil output.\n\nThe first companies to secure any business in the wake ‌of the U.S. military action in Caracas, however, were Dutch-based trader Vitol and Singapore-headquartered peer Trafigura, rather than U.S. majors.\n\nThe U.S. government tapped the giant merchant houses because they were better suited to quickly get Venezuelan oil exports flowing again, four industry sources familiar with the negotiations said. That is the first order of business for Washington before reconstruction ‌can begin, so that revenue from exports under U.S. supervision can fund the government of interim President Delcy Rodriguez in Caracas.\n\n\"Securing and marketing the initial barrels of Venezuelan crude oil was done at record speed to benefit both the American and Venezuelan people,\" a White House official told Reuters.\n\nVenezuela relies on oil exports for revenue, and has been starved of those proceeds for about a month under a blockade Trump imposed as he raised pressure on Maduro.\n\nWashington and Caracas are finalizing a $2 billion deal to sell up to 50 million barrels of crude to U.S. refiners and other buyers - oil that had been stuck on ships in Venezuelan waters and in storage tanks because of the blockade.\n\nFacilitating the initial oil sales was critical to ensure funds could flow back into Venezuela for everyday services and a process is in place to maintain the steady flow of production, sales, and refining of Venezuelan crude oil, the ⁠White House official said.\n\nTrafigura and Vitol have secured preliminary special licenses to negotiate and export the ‌Venezuelan crude, and Trafigura is set to load its first cargo this week, Chief Executive Richard Holtum said at the White House meeting with Trump.\n\nGLOBAL NETWORK ADDED TO TRADERS' APPEAL\n\nThe trading houses competed with Chevron to secure the supply deals. Chevron is the only U.S. oil major that operates in Venezuela, as a minority partner in joint ventures with Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA. Chevron has a license from U.S. authorities, which exempts it from ‍the sanctions the United States had imposed to choke off oil revenues to Maduro.",

    "description": "A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nThe grants supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, including battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and efforts to capture carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nThe Energy Department said the projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Russell Vought, the White House budget director, said on social media that “the Left’s climate agenda is being canceled.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said the administration’s action violated the Constitution’s equal protection requirements.\n\n“Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024,” Mehta wrote in a 17-page opinion. The administration offered no explanation for how their purposeful targeting of grant recipients based on their electoral support for Trump — or lack of it — “rationally advances their stated government interest,” the judge added.\n\nThe ruling was the second legal setback for the administration’s rollback of clean energy program in a matter of hours. A separate federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as Trump seeks to shut it down.\n\nA spokesman for the Energy Department said officials disagree with the judge’s decision on clean energy grants.\n\nOfficials “stand by our review process, which evaluated these awards individually and determined they did not meet the standards necessary to justify the continued spending of taxpayer dollars,” spokesman Ben Dietderich said. “The American people deserve a government that is accountable and responsible in managing taxpayer funds.”\n\nProjects were canceled in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state. All 16 targeted states supported Harris.\n\nThe cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.\n\nThe city of St. Paul and a coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit after they lost grants.\n\nTrump said in an interview last fall with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects that Democrats want. “I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said in the Oct. 1 interview.\n\nVickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the groups that filed the suit, said the court ruling “recognized that the Trump Department of Energy vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration, in violation of the bedrock Constitutional guarantee that all people in all states have equal protection under the law.”\n\nThe administration’s actions violated the Constitution, foundational American values and “imposed high costs on the American people who rely on clean affordable energy for their pocketbooks and for healthier lives,” Patton said.\n\nAnne Evens, CEO of Elevate Energy, one of the groups that lost funding, said the court ruling would help keep clean energy affordable and create jobs.\n\n“Affordable energy should be a reality for everyone, and the restoration of these grants is an important step toward making that possible,” she said.",

    "description": "Lower Chinese LNG demand could pressure global markets, especially as new U.S. and Qatari capacity comes online and Russian pipeline and LNG exports to China increase.",
    "fullText": "China is boosting domestic natural gas production, and it is doing it fast. A major LNG consumer—and importer—the country has been key in LNG demand forecasts. Now, these forecasts will need to be revised.\n\nLess than ten years ago, China was struggling to get its domestic gas production off the ground, especially in shale formations. China’s shale geology is different from the U.S. basins, and energy companies were finding it difficult to get commercial production going. Now, China’s state oil and gas majors are pumping more gas than ever and announcing new discoveries in the shale patch.\n\nIn November last year, China produced 22.1 billion cu m, which was a 7.1% increase on the year, Kpler reported this month citing official production data. The increase was driven by “faster-than-expected shale gas ramp-ups in the Sichuan Basin.” Based on that data, the energy analytics firm expects China’s total for 2025 to reach 263 billion cu m, rising to 278.5 billion cu m this year, again thanks to growing shale gas production in the Sichuan and Shanxi basins.\n\nAs with oil, rising domestic production would inevitably affect imports, even as China leans more heavily on natural gas for emission-reduction purposes. Last year, for instance, China booked higher domestic gas production and a rather substantial decline in LNG imports. In fact, imports of liquefied gas last year fell to the lowest in six years after a string of 12 monthly declines in a row. Imports only rebounded at the end of the year but not enough to reverse the decline. Kpler has predicted that Chinese demand for liquefied natural gas is going to decline this year as well, with shale gas production removing some 600,000 tons of LNG demand, reducing the total to 73.9 million tons.\n\nNow, 600,000 tons is not a whole lot in the context of a market where the United States alone exported over 100 million tons last year. But it does serve as yet another evidence of a trend in China to reduce dependence on energy imports, which has implications for global energy commodity markets that have gotten used to relying on China as the ultimate driver of demand.\n\nThe projected decline in China’s demand for gas—and by extension LNG—may interfere with new LNG capacity addition plans and prices, shrinking producers’ profits. It is these plans for a wave of new LNG supply, set to come online by the end of the decade, mostly from the top exporters, the United States and Qatar, that have prompted many analysts to expect an oversupplied LNG market by 2030 that would weigh on prices.",

    "fullText": "When Hollow Knight: Silksong came out last summer I was in so much pain that I didn’t know if I’d be able to play it. Could a video game teach me anything new about suffering?\n\nLast year I became uncomfortably well acquainted with suffering. In March I started experiencing excruciating pain in my right arm and shoulder – burning, zapping, energy-sapping pain that left me unable to think straight, emanating from a nexus of torment behind my shoulder blade and sometimes stretching all the way up to the base of my skull and all the way down into my fingers. Typing was agony, but everything was painful; even at rest it was horrible. I couldn’t play my guitar; I couldn’t play video games; I couldn’t sleep. I learned how quickly physical suffering lacerates your mental wellbeing.\n\nI’d had episodes of nagging pain from so-called repetitive strain injuries before, the product of long hours hunched over laptops and game controllers over the course of decades, but nothing like this. A few months later, after the initial unrelenting agony had subsided to a permanent hum of more moderate pain, it was diagnosed as brachial neuritis, inflammation of the nerve path that travels from the base of your neck down to your hand. (Nobody knows what causes it, but it sometimes happens after an infection or an injury.) The good news, I was told by a neurologist, was that it usually gets better in about one to three years, and I hadn’t lost any function in my right hand. The bad news was that there was nothing much to be done about the pain in the meantime.\n\nTraditional pain meds don’t really do much for nerve pain. And after trying out the small range of nerve pain medications – pills that act on the brain, where pain really lives – I discovered that they all sent me loopy in ways I would rather not ever experience again. So I had to figure out how to live with it. My nerves were upset; they had now learned the pain. It would take time to unlearn it.\n\nIn August, meanwhile, a small Australian developer called Team Cherry announced a release date for a game that had been in the works for many years. Silksong was the follow-up to Hollow Knight, a title I had loved when it came out in 2017: an atmospheric and enticingly challenging game about fighting your way through a corrupted underground bug kingdom. Silksong was so hotly anticipated that it became a meme; its name appeared in the comments under every gaming showcase for over half a decade, while Team Cherry remained resolutely silent about when it was coming out. Posters on Reddit started mock-ritually-sacrificing each other in an effort to manifest its release. Now it was finally coming out, and I was in so much pain that I didn’t know if I’d be able to play it.\n\nThere is an underlying narrative of overcoming the odds – of suffering and redemption – in almost all video games, but especially the difficult ones. And I love the difficult ones. Video games imbue suffering with meaning: you try and fail, try and fail, until you succeed. Perhaps, I thought, playing Silksong during a period of real-life suffering and disability might help me look at it differently.\n\nSilksong has the appearance of a very beautiful nightmare, and the energy of a horror-tinged European animated TV show you only half-remember from your childhood. Its player character, Hornet, is a masked spider in a red cloak; the other characters are oddly cute but dead-eyed bug creatures, hunched over with their own suffering. Beginning at the foot of the kingdom of Pharloom, you travel through moss-furred, luminescent caverns, moonlit temples, wind and sand-blasted wastelands, tight winding tunnels whose walls are made of cogs or tarnished bells, up towards the once gleaming Citadel at the top. Bugs have been making pilgrimages to the Citadel for untold generations but they rarely survive the journey. There is precious little life anywhere, and what there is will try to kill you. Something has poisoned their minds.\n\nThe journey mirrors Dante’s in The Divine Comedy from hell through purgatory to heaven, from cursed depths to the home of god. The piteous outpost where Hornet begins the game is little more than a shanty town; rag-clad bugs huddled in a place of temporary safety. The populace of Pharloom accepts their fate, cowering in every settlement with blank stares and sorrowful posture: this is how things are meant to be. Like any pilgrimage, the way to the Citadel involves enormous hardship before you come close to divinity. I was told this over and over by the bugs I met in between my battles with the feral beasts and corrupted priests that stood in my way – battles that often sent me back to a checkpoint, fuming, 10 or 20 or 50 times before I finally defeated them.\n\nExcept Silksong’s supposed heaven is hellish in itself. Once you get there, up to the Citadel – past the fog-wreathed swamp guarded by the vicious, flapping Moorwing, past the silk-wreathed Widow that holds the gilded town of Bellhart in a frightening state of suspended animation, past the Last Judge who guards the grand gate, swinging a flaming thurible that can end you in seconds with waves and columns of sweeping fire – you find that it has fallen, too. There is no point to the suffering of the pilgrims who come here. If they survive, there is only more suffering ahead. The highest places turn out to be some of the worst.\n\nThe Citadel is barely the halfway point of the game, however. Past that gate, Pharloom branches in all directions. Deep, deep below, there is a roiling furnace; in Sinners Road you find where the prisoners of the realm have been left to rot; there is an abandoned hospital, a pitiless wind-whipped mountain of ice, a museum of sorts that takes you through the realm in miniature (why is it there?). The guardians of these places become ever more punishing. I nearly lost my mind fighting Trobbio, the dancer, the flamboyant performer, trapped for ever on his stage, theatrically intoning his own name as he destroys me with pyrotechnics.\n\nHornet gleams silk-bright in this dismal world. Within her is the substance that holds Pharloom’s minds in thrall, the godly silk. She whips her divine power around herself like ribbons, to heal the damage done to her. She speaks with clarity and compassion, to bugs that respond in riddles or threats, half-mad. She plucks melodies on a stringed instrument that make the bugs around her turn their faces upwards and sing in disconnected couplets. And she fights: with her sharp-pointed needle, with bone-crafted boomerangs and plant-poison and flea-brew, with sharp tacks and javelin-spears and anything else she can find in Pharloom. She fights and fights, and yet beyond each battle waits another.\n\nHampered by pain, I am forced to explore all of this very, very slowly. It takes me months to make my way painstakingly through a game I would have rinsed in three weeks in my previous life. My pilgrimage cannot be rushed. A lot of managing pain involves cultivating a state of safety for your nervous system, minimising stress as much as possible, and it turns out that difficult video games are very stressful. The frustration of failure causes my hands to grip the controller too hard and my fingers begin to hurt. The adrenaline of victory sends me into a state of exhilarated fight-or-flight that my nerves can’t currently handle. Instead of disappearing into Silksong like I have with other games since I was a teenager, I play for 20, 40 minutes at a time, over months.\n\nUnexpectedly, this makes Pharloom begin to feel like a parallel dimension, somewhere I can slip into not just on my Nintendo Switch but in my mind. I have to stop playing when pain starts to travel to my hand, so I keep playing it in my head.\n\nI see the Cogwork Dancers, the balletic mechanical twin bosses at the very top of the Citadel, flitting in front of my mind’s eye in their predictable attack patterns. I think about the shaft I found in a corner of the Blasted Steps and wonder whether I can get up there with the piton-like tool that Hornet recently acquired. I think, all the time, about what happened in Pharloom; the clawed grip of religion on the minds of its populace, who cling to their rosary beads even as they lose their grasp on their own minds. I think about the tall princeling I rescued from a cell, crouched over the remains of one of the Cogwork Dancers: his partner, long ago.\n\nYou can tell that this game is a work of obsession. The detail everywhere is extraordinary, even in the writhing maggots that carpet the ground in the aptly named Putrified Ducts. But also, where in most game worlds everything feels oriented towards the player – fun playgrounds laid out for your enjoyment, a daub of yellow paint here and there to show you where to go – Hornet’s presence, my presence, feels almost incidental to Pharloom. It rots away without me, bugs chanting their devotions, patrolling silk-poisoned clerics clanging their bells. I come upon a settlement and am not welcomed as a saviour, but regarded through a veil of suspicion and despair.\n\nIndeed, some places in Pharloom aren’t fun at all. They’re places I never want to see again. Late one night I find myself in Bilewater, a fetid parkour course over more pools of writhing maggots and past bile-spitting moss-monsters. I am here to find Shakra the warrior-cartographer, whose haunting song has guided me towards her throughout Pharloom, scrabbling for rosaries to pay for her maps. Her trail is marked with bronze rings, a detail I can’t believe I didn’t notice earlier in the game, but it takes me days of spaced-out play to make the journey from the nearest safe bench to the tranquil pool where she rests. Trickster creatures follow me, setting tripwires and traps that make it even harder to avoid the gaping mouths, slashing teeth and erratic movements of the native creatures here. It brought me to the verge of tears.\n\nGiving up never felt like an option. I’ve taken breaks from Silksong – a week or two at a time – but I have not given up, not even when I got stuck in an almost-impossible gauntlet involving waves of aggressive crows. Silksong feels like a sadistic game at times, needlessly punishing: take a hit and it’ll often wipe not one but two precious units of Hornet’s health. I’m not sure why I didn’t quit. It wasn’t pure obstinacy. I think that because I was suffering all of the time anyway, adding a bit more suffering into my days by choice at least gave me a feeling of control.\n\nDifficult video games require tenacity and resilience. Keep throwing yourself at the problem unrelentingly until you defeat it, they teach you. There’s nothing you can’t do with enough skill and determination. You can always win. You just have to try hard enough.\n\nThis does not apply to pain. No amount of effort will persuade nerves to heal any faster, and pain is not something that can be overcome with sheer determination. I’ve carried plenty of strategies from video games into my real life before: I have applied the same bullheaded tenacity to learning languages, writing books, supporting and caring for my friends and family. But nothing I’ve ever learned from video games has helped me deal with pain. Instead I’ve had to learn how to do things more slowly, stay within my capacity, and admit my limitations without guilt or self-admonishment.\n\nI did not know that I could do things slowly. I didn’t know that I would be able to play Silksong slowly. But I have learned how. As I have been playing through this game I have also been reading endlessly about modern pain science. At first I was doing this rather desperately, in search of a way out, a way to speed things up, to get myself out of suffering. What I learned instead is that acknowledging pain is the first step to learning to live with it, and that learning to live with it is what it actually means to overcome it. Pain is the brain’s danger signal: if you ignore it, it only gets louder. If you start listening instead, observing and acquiescing, your brain might put away the megaphone. I have learned that acknowledging pain and modifying your life around it does not mean giving up. It means you get to keep on living – keep on playing.\n\nAfter four months and 40 hours, I have done almost everything there is to do in Pharloom. I am fighting the very final boss, and I have been trying to defeat her since before Christmas. I hoped I might finish this game before the end of 2025, a neat little piece of symbolism to represent perseverance through an extremely challenging year. It hasn’t worked out quite so elegantly, but Silksong has helped me look at suffering a little differently. There doesn’t need to be a point to it; it doesn’t necessarily come with a tidy narrative of perseverance and eventual redemption. But you can learn to work around it. You can make your way through.\n\nSuper Nintendo: How One Japanese Company Helped the World Have Fun by Keza MacDonald is out 12 February (Guardian Faber Publishing, £20).

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump says US companies will now have access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves. But the country’s other commodities have also caught his administration’s attention.\n\nVenezuela has unverified amounts of minerals, metals and potentially rare earth elements, experts say. These raw materials are indispensable for industries from defense to technology, and the administration has repeatedly stressed their importance for US national security.\n\nBut while Washington might aspire to secure Venezuela’s critical elements, it’s a tall order, experts say, and wouldn’t do much to bolster America’s supply chain.\n\nThe quantity and economic viability of Venezuela’s mineral resources are uncertain. Companies also face major risks mining in Venezuela without sustained security guarantees.\n\nMany of these regions have guerrilla soldiers and armed groups engaging in illegal gold mining, experts say. Energy-intensive rare earths mining can also harm the environment.\n\n“There is an awareness within the administration that even beyond oil, there’s wider natural resource value in the country,” said Reed Blakemore, director of research at the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center.\n\n“However, if we’re talking about the conditions under which we are able to exploit those mineral resources and bring them to market, it’s a much more challenging story,” Blakemore said. “And even, frankly, more challenging than the oil story.”\n\nEven if US companies were to try to mine Venezuela’s rare earths, getting them out of the ground is just one part of the process. Those materials are usually sent to China for refining.\n\nChina accounted for over 90% of global rare earths refining in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency. The country maintains a virtual monopoly in processing and refining the materials due to decades of government subsidies, industry expansion and lax environmental regulations.\n\nRare earths have become a major sticking point in US-China trade tensions. Beijing last year implemented some export controls on rare earths during trade spats, raising concerns about America’s lack of secure supply chains for these critical materials.\n\n“China still holds near-singular capacity to process rare earth metals, and that industrial and geopolitical edge cannot be overcome overnight,” said Joel Dodge, director of industrial policy and economic security at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator.\n\nThe US Geological Survey designates 60 “critical minerals” vital to economic and national security.",

Maduro has been indicted in the Southern District of New York on weapons and drug charges.\n\nOn Friday, American oil executives met with Trump and senior administration officials to discuss a proposed $100 billion plan to invest in Venezuela's oil operations.\n\nTrump earlier said the government may reimburse oil companies for growing their operations in Venezuela. The Big Oil executives at the meeting, for their part, appeared largely hesitant to reenter the volatile country before major reforms are made.\n\nFor Cuba, losing access to Venezuelan oil would be a big blow to its already uncertain economy. According to the US Energy Information Administration, Cuba imports the majority of its oil from Venezuela — about 30,000 to 35,000 barrels a day, per most estimates.\n\nSpeaking to reporters last week on board Air Force One, Trump said Cuba appeared \"ready to fall.\"\n\n\"I don't know if they're going to hold out,\" he said. \"But Cuba now has no income. They got all of their income from Venezuela, from the Venezuelan oil.\"\n\nAsked whether the US would take military action in Cuba, Trump said he did not think it would be necessary, adding: \"I think it's just going to fall.\"\n\nIn his post on Truth Social, Trump also positioned the US as Venezuela's protector moving forward, saying that most of the Cuban security personnel stationed in Caracas had been killed in the operation to seize Maduro.\n\nThe Cuban government announced that 32 of its nationals died during the US raid on the capital.",

Studies by the US government suggest the area above the Arctic Circle could hold as many as 90 billion barrels of oil and nearly 1,700 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.\n\nThe oil alone would be enough to sustain the entirety of global demand for nearly three years if all other drilling worldwide were to cease tomorrow.\n\nAt the center of these ambitions is Greenland, where some of the harshest conditions on Earth protect stores that have drawn in prospectors looking for the chance at another discovery the size of Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay.\n\nA company called March GL, which will be renamed Greenland Energy Company after it goes public this year, is hoping to vault itself into the upper echelons of the industry by extracting some of these billions of barrels of oil from a peninsula called Jameson Land sticking off the eastern coast of Greenland, the largest island in the world. The oil could be transformative for the US and European markets likely to receive it, injecting a massive wave of new supply that could help wean Europe from its dependence on Russian petroleum, currently under a steep sanctions regime as its war in Ukraine rages on.\n\nIn late October, Yahoo Finance accompanied March GL CEO and veteran oilman Robert Price, alongside the company’s lead petroleum engineer, to a town called Tasiilaq on Greenland’s eastern coast, where March GL’s contractors were preparing to store a collection of heavy machinery in town for the winter.\n\nPrice had been planning to barge the earthmovers up to Jameson Land, where they would begin constructing a three-mile-long road from the coast to the inland site where March GL will be drilling its first wells. Rough seas off the island’s eastern coast left the tugboat with which the company planned to haul the equipment unable to make the journey; by late autumn, the window of ice-free water to make this trip was closing too quickly to wait for a new one.\n\nInstead, March GL’s team will keep much of its equipment in Tasiilaq until the spring or summer, when the ice will thaw, compressing their timelines — a testament to the tenuous-at-best operating conditions in Greenland.\n\nSince that trip, the complexities of Price’s Greenland ambitions have only increased.\n\nAfter the arrest and extraction of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in early January, President Trump renewed his push to annex the Danish autonomous territory. Trump said during a press briefing on Jan. 4 that “we need Greenland” to protect US national security interests in the Arctic, comments which set off a wave of pushback from the Greenlandic and Danish governments.",

    "description": "U.S.",
    "fullText": "HAVANA/HOUSTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday said no more Venezuelan oil or money will go to Cuba and suggested the Communist-run island should strike a deal with Washington, ramping up pressure on the long-time U.S. nemesis and provoking defiant words from the island's leadership.\n\nVenezuela is ​Cuba's biggest oil supplier, but no cargoes have departed from Venezuelan ports to the Caribbean country since the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by U.S. forces ‌in early January amid a strict U.S. oil blockade on the OPEC country, shipping data shows.\n\nMeanwhile, Caracas and Washington are progressing on a $2 billion deal to supply up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil to the U.S. with ‌proceeds to be deposited in U.S. Treasury-supervised accounts, a major test of the emerging relationship between Trump and interim President Delcy Rodriguez.\n\n\"THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO! I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sunday.\n\n\"Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela,\" Trump added.\n\nCuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel rejected Trump's threat on social media, suggesting the U.S. had no moral authority to force a deal on Cuba.\n\n\"Cuba is a free, independent, and sovereign nation. Nobody dictates what ⁠we do,\" Diaz-Canel said on X. \"Cuba does not attack; it has ‌been attacked by the U.S. for 66 years, and it does not threaten; it prepares, ready to defend the homeland to the last drop of blood.\"\n\nThe U.S. president did not elaborate on his suggested deal.\n\nBut Trump's push on Cuba represents the latest escalation in his move to bring regional ‍powers in line with the United States and underscores the seriousness of the administration's ambition to dominate the Western Hemisphere.\n\nTrump's top officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have made no secret of their expectation that the recent U.S. intervention in Venezuela could push Cuba over the edge.\n\nU.S. officials have hardened their rhetoric against Cuba in recent weeks, though the two countries have been at odds since former leader Fidel Castro's ​1959 revolution.\n\nCuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said in another post on X on Sunday that Cuba had the right to import fuel from any suppliers willing to ‌export it. He also denied that Cuba had received financial or other \"material\" compensation in return for security services provided to any country.\n\nThirty-two members of Cuba's armed forces and intelligence services were killed during the U.S. raid on Venezuela. Cuba said those killed were responsible for \"security and defense\" but did not provide details on the arrangement between the two long-time allies.\n\nCuba relies on imported crude and fuel mainly provided by Venezuela, and Mexico in smaller volumes, purchased on the open market to keep its power generators and vehicles running.\n\nAs its operational refining capacity dwindled in recent years, Venezuela's supply of crude and fuel to Cuba has fallen. But the South American country is still the largest provider with some 26,500 barrels per day exported last year, according to ship ⁠tracking data and internal documents of state-run PDVSA, which covered roughly 50% of Cuba's oil deficit.\n\nEven before Maduro's ​capture, Cuba had been struggling to keep the lights on. Vast swaths of the island live without electricity for ​much of the day, and even the capital Havana has seen its economy crippled by hours-long rolling blackouts.\n\nShortages of food, fuel and medicine have put Cubans on edge and have prompted a record-breaking exodus, primarily to the United States, in the past five years.\n\nMexico has emerged in recent ‍weeks as a critical alternative oil supplier to ⁠the island, but the supply remains small, according to the shipping data.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum last week said her country had not increased supply volumes, but given recent political events in Venezuela, Mexico had turned into an \"important supplier\" of crude to Cuba.\n\nU.S. intelligence has painted a grim picture of Cuba's economic and political situation, but its assessments offer ⁠no clear support for Trump's prediction that the island is \"ready to fall,\" Reuters reported on Saturday, citing three people familiar with the confidential assessments.\n\nThe CIA's view is that key sectors of the Cuban economy, such as agriculture and ‌tourism, are severely strained by frequent blackouts, trade sanctions and other problems. The potential loss of oil imports and other support from Venezuela could make governing ‌more difficult for Diaz-Canel.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Ukrainian drone strike sparked a fire at an oil depot in Russia’s southern Volgograd region, officials said Saturday, after Russia launched a powerful hypersonic missile along with drones and other weapons that disrupted Kyiv's power supply and heating.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of casualties, Volgograd Gov. Andrei Bocharov was quoted as saying in a Telegram post published on the channel of the local administration. The post did not specify the damage, but said that people living near the depot may have to be evacuated.\n\nUkraine’s General Staff said Saturday it had struck the Zhutovskaya oil depot overnight. In a statement on Telegram, it said the depot is supplying fuel to Russian forces, adding that damage was being assessed.\n\nUkraine’s long-range drone strikes on Russian energy sites aim to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue its full-scale invasion. Russia wants to cripple the Ukrainian power grid, seeking to deny civilians access to heat, light and running water in what Kyiv officials say is an attempt to “weaponize winter.”\n\nSaturday's attack came the day after Russia bombarded Ukraine with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles overnight into Friday, according to Ukrainian officials, killing at least four people in the capital. For only the second time in the nearly 4-year-old war, it used a powerful new hypersonic missile that struck western Ukraine in a clear warning to Kyiv’s NATO allies.\n\nThe intense barrage and the launch of the nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile followed reports of major progress in talks between Ukraine and its allies on how to defend the country from further Moscow aggression if a U.S.-led peace deal is struck.\n\nStéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, said Friday's attacks “have resulted in significant civilian casualties and deprived millions of Ukrainians of essential services, including electricity, heating and water at a time of acute humanitarian need.”\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said heat supply would be fully restored in Kyiv by the end of Saturday.\n\nShe said areas on the right bank of the Dnieper River would gradually lift emergency blackouts and return to scheduled outages. But resuming power supply on the left bank, where Russian attacks were concentrated, is more complicated due to significant damage to the power grid, she added.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said Saturday that its forces used aviation, drones, missiles and artillery to strike Ukrainian energy facilities and fuel-storage depots.\n\nRussia struck Ukraine with 121 drones and one Iskander-M ballistic missile, according to the Ukrainian air force. It said 94 drones were shot down.\n\nSeparately, the Russian Defense Ministry said 59 Ukrainian drones were neutralized overnight over Russia and occupied Crimea.\n\nUkraine's military said that besides the oil depot in Volgograd, it had struck a drone storage facility belonging to a unit of Russia’s 19th Motor Rifle Division in Zaporizhzhia, southern Ukraine, as well as a drone command and control point near the eastern city of Pokrovsk.\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "Meta Platforms is turning to nuclear power to drive its AI ambitions, and its latest deal with a trio of companies is sending stocks in the sector soaring.\n\nThe tech giant revealed that it signed an agreement with several companies to help supply nuclear power for its data centers, including the massive Prometheus AI supercluster being built in New Albany, Ohio. The one gigawatt facility is expected to come online later this year.\n\nThe three companies that will help power it are Oklo, Vistra Corp, and privately held TerraPower. Both nuclear power stocks surged on news of the Meta deal, sparking momentum for many of their peers as well.\n\nHere are the big moves in the space on Friday:\n\nThis isn't the first nuclear power deal that Meta has inked. Last summer, it announced a similar agreement with Constellation Energy, which saw its shares spike on the news.\n\n\"State-of-the-art data centers and AI infrastructure are essential to securing America's position as a global leader in AI,\" said Joel Kaplan, chief of global affairs at Meta. \"Nuclear energy will help power our AI future, strengthen our country's energy infrastructure, and provide clean, reliable electricity for everyone.\"\n\nBig tech's support of nuclear energy has risen in recent years as experts have touted the need for alternative sources of power to enable the AI buildout. Oklo is backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, though he stepped down from his position as chairman of its board of directors in August 2025.\n\n\"Two years ago, Oklo shared its vision to build a new generation of advanced nuclear powerhouses in Ohio,\" Oklo CEO Jacob DeWitte said. \"Today, that vision is becoming a reality through the support of a multi-year effort with Meta.\"",

    "description": "USS Gerald R. Ford is one of a dozen Navy warships that was deployed to the Caribbean region last year.",
    "fullText": "The US military said on Friday that it \"apprehended\" an oil tanker in a pre-dawn operation in the Caribbean Sea, marking the fifth seizure of a Venezuela-linked vessel allegedly operating in violation of sanctions.\n\nUS Southern Command said in a statement that Marines and sailors, working in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, launched from the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford and captured the tanker, Olina, \"without incident.\"\n\nIt appears to be the first time that the US has directly acknowledged the Ford's involvement in the five boarding and seizure operations that began in early December. However, the government has indicated that the carrier was used for at least one of the other missions.\n\nThe Ford is the Navy's largest, newest, and most advanced aircraft carrier. It carries dozens of embarked fighter jets, early warning planes, and helicopters and was deployed to the Caribbean in the fall as part of the massive build-up of military forces in the region.\n\nLast year, the US imposed sanctions on Olina, which was flying the flag of Panama and named Minerva M at the time, according to a Treasury Department document.\n\nData from MarineTraffic, a ship-tracking site, showed that the tanker was off Venezuela's coast several weeks ago and was sailing under the flag of Timor-Leste.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Olina a \"ghost fleet\" tanker that was suspected of carrying embargoed oil and \"had departed Venezuela attempting to evade US forces.\"\n\nThe US announced a naval blockade on sanctioned oil tankers trying to enter or leave Venezuela last month as part of an effort to pressure the country's then-President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nThe operation on Friday marks the third tanker seizure this week. US forces captured two vessels on Wednesday: one in the North Atlantic after a dramatic, weekslong chase and another near the Caribbean. The American military boarded two other vessels — Skipper and Centuries — last month.\n\n\"The ghost fleets will not outrun justice. They will not hide under false claims of nationality,\" Noem said on Friday, adding that the US will continue to seize sanctioned tankers.\n\nThe Trump administration's pressure campaign against Maduro and Venezuela, which included the naval blockade, also consisted of the deployment of warships, military aircraft, and thousands of troops to the Caribbean.\n\nSince early September, US forces have carried out dozens of airstrikes on alleged drug boats, with President Donald Trump routinely suggesting that he may take action against Venezuela.\n\nTensions between Trump and Maduro culminated last weekend in a dramatic surprise operation and raid to capture the former Venezuelan president.\n\nIn the days since, Trump has threatened additional action against neighboring countries, including Mexico, Cuba, and Colombia.\n\nA US official told Business Insider on Thursday that the 12 Navy warships deployed to the Caribbean before the Maduro raid were still in the region, with no scaling down of forces yet.",

In this work, we show that one can overcome these obstacles by using a linear Hamiltonian-based machine learning method which provides a compact quantum representation of classical data via ground state problems for k-local Hamiltonians. We use the recent sample-based Krylov quantum diagonalization method to compute low-energy states of the data Hamiltonians, whose parameters are trained to express classical datasets through local gradients. We demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of the methods by performing experiments on benchmark datasets using up to 50 qubits of an IBM Heron quantum processor.",

    "description": "Ukrainian cities have set up hundreds of \"invincibility points\" in preparation for a rare mass blackout event like this week's.",
    "fullText": "A new wave of Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure has put two of its biggest regions to the test, as local cities rolled out plans for dealing with their worst blackouts in years.\n\nTheir prepared \"blackout mode\" response provides some insight into how urban centers might steel themselves for energy crises in wartime, especially during cold months. Ukraine's winter can turn brutal in January and February, when temperatures typically drop to 18°F.\n\nMass blackouts can also disrupt water and sewage systems, hospitals, public transportation, and road control, including traffic lights.\n\nBoth Ukrainian troops and civilians have long learned to cope with frequent energy shortages in the winter, maintaining backup generators, battery-powered lamps, and stockpiles of coal or gas.\n\nBut Moscow's latest attacks on Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk, two eastern Ukrainian regions, plunged both areas into almost total darkness this week.\n\nRegional leaders have described it as their biggest energy crisis since 2022, when Ukrainians first faced wartime power outages. Borys Filatov, the mayor of Dnipro, Dnipropetrovsk's largest city, said the situation there was one of the most severe in the country and had risen to the level of a \"national emergency.\"\n\n\"This is the first total blackout in the entire region in recent years,\" Ivan Fedorov, Zaporizhzhia's governor, said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nAs national authorities reported that over 1 million people had lost heat and water, local officials rushed to restore power and open access to facilities prearranged for the blackouts.\n\nOne of their prepared responses was to deploy \"invincibility points,\" or earmarked emergency shelters equipped with heat, communication, and basic necessities.\n\nSome local governments publish a map with available locations for civilians. The city of Dnipro, for example, maintains a list of mostly schools, municipality buildings, and metro stations designated as safe spots.\n\nCivilians are meant to visit these shelters to \"warm up, charge your gadgets, and wait out the power outage,\" per the municipal government.\n\nA video published by Oleksy Kuleba, Ukraine's vice prime minister for reconstruction and the minister for community and territorial development, showed one point in Dnipropetrovsk that appears to be located in a small convenience store.\n\nKuleba said the region's energy sector had been hit with a \"massive blow,\" and that over 5,000 people visited 500 such locations in the city of Dnipro within 24 hours after the power outages began.\n\nKuleba added that neighboring regions in Ukraine had donated 45 generators to Dnipropetrovsk, where some of its trains had switched to burning onboard fuel for power.\n\nZaporizhzhia's governor, Fedorov, also said on Thursday that the region had 400 established invincibility points, with 200 ready for visitors within two hours.\n\n\"Residents could warm up, call their relatives, drink hot tea, and, if necessary, stay overnight,\" he said.\n\nFilatov, Dnipro's mayor, said on Thursday that the city had set up 130 water dispensers, which his staff marked on Google Maps, and that disrupted public transport would be temporarily replaced by buses.\n\nHospitals were already equipped with alternative power sources and necessities, while parts of the city, on the western bank of the Dnipro River, were supported by backup power, he added.\n\n\"The city's sewage system is also powered,\" Filatov said.\n\nNotably, Filatov said that while authorities had extended local school holidays to January 11, kindergartens would operate on four-hour shifts \"because it's clear that parents are also in a difficult situation.\"\n\nIn Zaporizhzhia, Fedorov said the region had been left \"completely without electricity\" on Wednesday evening.\n\n\"We immediately went into 'blackout' mode and started working according to a clear plan,\" he said.\n\nZaporizhzhia's hospitals similarly switched to backup power within minutes, and the region's traffic lights \"worked autonomously,\" he added.\n\nUkrainian officials have since said that power has been partially returned to both regions, with Kuleba reporting on late Thursday evening that water and heating in Dnipropetrovsk had been restored to over 1.7 million people and 270,000 people, respectively.\n\nEnergy supplier DTEK said that around 700,000 families in the Dnipropetrovsk region once again had access to electricity, though it added that Russian bombing was continuing.\n\n\"An exhausting day for energy workers in the Dnipropetrovsk region,\" the company said.\n\nFedorov warned repeatedly on Thursday evening of incoming drone and guided missile strikes over Zaporizhzhia. He later said that Russia had carried out over 728 strikes, including drone attacks, artillery shelling, and multiple-launch rocket system strikes across Ukraine that day.\n\nBoth Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk are close to the southern and eastern front lines in Ukraine.\n\nKyiv has often accused Russia of specifically targeting energy infrastructure during the winter to exhaust and punish Ukrainian civilians, which is a war crime but is often difficult to prove.\n\nThe Kremlin has often responded that its strikes were intended for legitimate military targets, though the years have shown that critical facilities are regularly damaged or destroyed by the attacks.\n\n\"There is no military sense in such strikes on the energy sector, on infrastructure, which leave people without electricity and heating in winter conditions,\" said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — When it comes to claiming that Venezuelan oil is now under his control, President Donald Trump is mincing no words. But no small part of that oil belongs to China under contracts it struck with Caracas years ago, setting the stage for a delicate diplomatic dance in the next few weeks.\n\nSome experts expect Trump to work with China in an effort to stabilize trade relations. After all, Trump is expected to visit Beijing in April as part of an effort to protect the fragile trade truce he reached with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last year.\n\n“The administration appears focused on avoiding unnecessary escalation or new irritants with Beijing while keeping leverage firmly on Washington’s terms,” said Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nHe added that he doubted Trump would risk turning Venezuela into a “flashpoint that complicates trade dynamics or Trump’s personal engagement with Xi.”\n\nChina is owed at least $10 billion from Venezuela, according to various estimates, a debt that former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro had paid down by shipping oil to China. It is possible that the interim Venezuelan government complying with Washington’s demands could question the legality of those loans-for-oil deals and cease payments.\n\nTwo major Chinese state-owned enterprises — China National Petroleum Corp. and Sinopec — are entitled to 4.4 billion barrels of oil reserves in Venezuela, the highest for any foreign country, according to a research note by the investment bank Morgan Stanley.\n\nU.S. companies also have claims for tens of billions of dollars from when Caracas nationalized the oil industry, and it’s not clear how these IOUs will be honored and in what order.\n\nThe U.S. seized two sanctioned oil tankers this week as part of a plan to assert control over Venezuelan oil shipments. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the U.S. will handle the sales of Venezuela’s oil “indefinitely,” depositing proceeds into U.S.-controlled accounts that will ultimately “flow back into Venezuela to benefit the Venezuelan people.”\n\nThe administration said this week that the U.S. would kickstart those sales with 30 million to 50 million barrels taken from the South American country’s crude storage facilities. Asked for more detail, a Trump administration official not authorized to comment publicly and speaking on condition of anonymity said U.S. policy was to wind down “adversarial outside influence” in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe U.S. using such leverage over a crucial natural resource comes after Beijing flexed its muscles last year by choking off critical supplies of rare-earth magnets and weaponizing its purchase of American soybeans in the trade war with Washington. When Trump met Xi in South Korea in October, the two men agreed to a one-year truce, backing off from sky-high tariffs and export controls on each other.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2023, Venezuela was the fourth-largest recipient of Beijing's official credit, having received $106 billion worth of loans from China’s official-sector creditors, according to AidData, a research lab at Virginia's College of William & Mary that tracks Beijing's overseas lending activities. But how much of the total that Caracas has paid off and what is still owed is unclear, said AidData executive director Brad Parks, because Caracas stopped reporting debt details several years ago.\n\nWhile some estimates put the outstanding debt at $10 billion, Parks said the figure could be much higher because U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan oil might have delayed loan repayments. The loans from China, under an unusual arrangement, were set up to be paid down with proceeds from oil exports.\n\nIn China, the capture of Maduro evoked memories of another leader who had struck deals with Chinese companies and then suddenly lost power: Libya's Moammar Gadhafi.\n\nAfter the 2011 fall of Gadhafi, Chinese businesses had to leave behind billions in investments. Cui Shoujun, professor of international studies at Renmin University in Beijing, told the Chinese news and commentary site guancha.cn that the transition government in Caracas could deem agreements under Maduro unlawful and the debt to China illegal.\n\nAs in Libya, Beijing’s stakes in Venezuela have gone beyond oil. Chinese firms have invested in telecommunications, railways and ports in Venezuela, all now at risk, according to a report by the global financial firm Jefferies.\n\nStill, the firm noted that Beijing will likely manage any disruption because Venezuelan oil counted for only a small percentage of China's oil imports and because Beijing has diversified its energy supplies and pivoted to electrification.\n\nHours before he was captured by U.S. forces, Maduro hosted a high-level Chinese diplomat at the presidential palace and praised the countries' ties that had prospered from the days of his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, and given Beijing a strong foothold in America's backyard.\n\nVenezuela is the only Latin American country that has a high-level strategic partnership with China, on par with close friends like Pakistan, and the ouster of Maduro is expected to curtail China's influence in the Western Hemisphere — in line with one of the goals spelled out in the Trump administration's National Security Strategy.\n\nBeijing's response to the capture of Maduro\n\nSoon after Maduro was captured, Beijing said it was “deeply shocked” by the blatant use of U.S. force against a sovereign state and action against its president and said it “strongly” condemned the U.S. actions. It called for the immediate release of Maduro and his wife.\n\nChinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong said Thursday that no nation has the right to interfere with economic and trade cooperation between China and Venezuela, which he said is between two sovereign states and protected by international and domestic laws.\n\n“No matter how the political situation in Venezuela evolves, China’s willingness to deepen bilateral economic and trade cooperation will not change,” He said.\n\nSingleton said Beijing does not wield the clout in the Western Hemisphere as touted.\n\n“Beijing can protest diplomatically,” he said, “but it cannot protect partners or assets once Washington decides to apply direct pressure.”",

    "fullText": "Two US Navy destroyers helped American forces chase down, board, and ultimately seize a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the North Atlantic after a weekslong chase across the ocean, a defense official told Business Insider on Thursday.\n\nThe Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers USS Bulkeley and USS Paul Ignatius \"supported\" the operations to seize the vessel, initially called Bella 1, on Wednesday, the official said.\n\nThe official declined to provide additional details about the warships' role in the seizure, citing operational security concerns.\n\nThe destroyers' involvement in the mission, which also included the Coast Guard and special operations forces, highlights the scale of the US military's efforts to capture the oil tanker, on the run since it evaded a naval blockade. Flight-tracking data showed various aircraft were airborne either shortly before or during the operation.\n\nThe UK government said it supported the operation with a tanker and Royal Air Force surveillance aircraft. A NATO official told Business Insider that the alliance's standing naval forces were not involved.\n\nBella 1, which has been described by the Trump administration as a \"dark fleet\" tanker operating in violation of sanctions, evaded a US naval blockade of sanctioned vessels near Venezuela last month and avoided attempts by the American military to board the vessel.\n\nThe tanker, sailing under the flag of Guyana, then fled north into the Atlantic, reflagged as a Russian vessel, and changed its name to the Marinera. On the run, the crew even painted the country's tricolor on the hull.\n\nThe Coast Guard pursued the tanker for weeks. The unusual chase ended on Wednesday when American forces seized the vessel in waters about halfway between the UK and Iceland.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told reporters that because the vessel had a judicial seizure order, the ship's crew is \"subject to prosecution for any applicable violation of federal law, and they will be brought to the United States for such prosecution if necessary.\"\n\nRussia's foreign ministry condemned the seizure and said that threats to prosecute the tanker's crew \"are entirely unacceptable,\" the state-owned news agency Tass reported on Thursday.\n\nSeparately, the US military said that it seized another sanctioned tanker — M/T Sophia — near the Caribbean Sea on Wednesday after it was \"conducting illicit activities\" in the region.\n\nThe back-to-back interdictions mark the latest in a string of vessel seizures that have occurred since the US announced last month that a naval blockade on sanctioned oil tankers trying to enter or leave Venezuela was going into effect.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the two tankers that were seized on Wednesday had either \"last docked\" in Venezuela or were sailing to the country.\n\n\"The United States continues to enforce the blockade against all dark fleet vessels illegally transporting Venezuelan oil to finance illicit activity, stealing from the Venezuelan people,\" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday after the operations. \"Only legitimate and lawful energy commerce — as determined by the US — will be permitted.\"\n\nThe US naval blockade was set up as part of a pressure campaign against Venezuela's former president, Nicolás Maduro, whom the US had long accused of facilitating drug trafficking and other criminal activity, allegations he denies.\n\nThe campaign also included a massive US military buildup in the Caribbean that began in August. American forces carried out dozens of airstrikes on alleged drug boats over the following months, as President Donald Trump threatened to take action against Venezuela.\n\nTensions between Trump and Maduro culminated over the weekend, when the US staged a dramatic surprise operation to capture Maduro. American forces who raided his compound in Caracas were supported by more than 150 military aircraft.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has threatened additional action against other countries near Venezuela, including Colombia, Cuba, and Mexico.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING (AP) — China escalated its trade tensions with Japan on Wednesday by launching an investigation into imported dichlorosilane, a chemical gas used in making semiconductors, a day after it imposed curbs on the export of so-called dual-use goods that could be used by Japan’s military.\n\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement that it had launched the investigation following an application from the domestic industry showing the price of dichlorosilane imported from Japan had decreased 31% between 2022 and 2024.\n\n“The dumping of imported products from Japan has damaged the production and operation of our domestic industry,” the ministry said.\n\nThe measure comes a day after Beijing banned exports to Japan of dual-use goods that can have military applications.\n\nBeijing has been showing mounting displeasure with Tokyo after new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested late last year that her nation's military could intervene if China were to take action against Taiwan — an island democracy that Beijing considers its own territory.\n\nTensions were stoked again on Tuesday when Japanese lawmaker Hei Seki, who last year was sanctioned by China for “spreading fallacies” about Taiwan and other disputed territories, visited Taiwan and called it an independent country. Also known as Yo Kitano, he has been banned from entering China. He told reporters that his arrival in Taiwan demonstrated the two are “different countries.”\n\n“I came to Taiwan … to prove this point, and to tell the world that Taiwan is an independent country,” Hei Seki said, according to Taiwan’s Central News Agency.\n\n“The nasty words of a petty villain like him are not worth commenting on,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning retorted when asked about his comment.\n\nMasaaki Kanai, head of Asia Oceanian Affairs at Japan's Foreign Ministry, urged China to scrap the trade curbs, saying a measure exclusively targeting Japan that deviates from international practice is unacceptable. Japan, however, has yet to announce any retaliatory measures.\n\nAs the two countries feuded, speculation rose that China might target rare earths exports to Japan, in a move similar to the rounds of critical minerals export restrictions it has imposed as part of its trade war with the United States.\n\nChina controls most of the global production of heavy rare earths, used for making powerful, heat-resistant magnets used in industries such as defense and electric vehicles.\n\nWhile the Commerce Ministry did not mention any new rare earths curbs, the official newspaper China Daily, seen as a government mouthpiece, quoted anonymous sources saying Beijing was considering tightening exports of certain rare earths to Japan. That report could not be independently confirmed.\n\nImproved South Korean ties contrast with Japan row\n\nAs Beijing spars with Tokyo, it has made a point of courting a different East Asian power — South Korea.\n\nOn Wednesday, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung wrapped up a four-day trip to China – his first since taking office in June. Lee and Chinese President Xi Jinping oversaw the signing of cooperation agreements in areas such as technology, trade, transportation and environmental protection.\n\nAs if to illustrate a contrast with the China-Japan trade frictions, Lee joined two business events at which major South Korean and Chinese companies pledged to collaborate.\n\nThe two sides signed 24 export contracts worth a combined $44 million, according to South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Resources.\n\nDuring Lee’s visit, Chinese media also reported that South Korea overtook Japan as the leading destination for outbound flights from China’s mainland over the New Year’s holiday.\n\nChina has been discouraging travel to Japan, saying Japanese leaders’ comments on Taiwan have created “significant risks to the personal safety and lives of Chinese citizens in Japan.”",

    "description": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns about 6% of Chevron, the only US oil major currently operating in Venezuela.",
    "fullText": "Investors are scrambling to identify potential winners from the US capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and President Donald Trump's plan to \"run\" the nation and deliver an oil boom. Berkshire Hathaway is one contender thanks to its large bet on Chevron.\n\n\"Berkshire should benefit from its 6% stake in Chevron, since it is the only US oil major in Venezuela,\" David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland who's closely followed Berkshire for more than four decades, told Business Insider.\n\nBerkshire — now led by Greg Abel following Warren Buffett's recent retirement as CEO — is Chevron's largest corporate shareholder with a 6% stake worth about $19 billion, assuming Berkshire hasn't altered the wager since its latest portfolio update.\n\nThe conglomerate counted the oil major as its fifth-largest stock position at the end of September 2025, representing about 7% of the total $267 billion value of its US stock portfolio.\n\nVenezuela has the world's largest proven crude oil reserves, but decades of underinvestment in its oil infrastructure mean it only produces about 1% of global oil output.\n\nChevron has secured short-term exemptions to US sanctions on Venezuela, allowing it to produce and export limited amounts of the country's oil.\n\nRivals, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, left Venezuela years ago following the nationalization of the country's oil industry and government seizures of foreign-owned assets.\n\nTrump said over the weekend that he envisions large US oil companies coming to Venezuela, fixing and modernizing its pipelines and refineries, and supercharging the country's oil production.\n\nExcited investors piled into oil stocks on Monday. Chevron shares surged as much as 6.3% on the day to a nine-month high of about $166, briefly valuing Berkshire's stake at over $20 billion. They retreated on Tuesday but are still up nearly 3% so far in 2026.\n\nChevron already has stakes in five production projects in Venezuela, thanks to partnerships with affiliates of the country's state oil company.\n\nOn an earnings call in August, CEO Mike Wirth highlighted Chevron's deep foothold in the country. He said it has been operating in Venezuela for more than a century, and has \"played an important role in regional energy security, as well as maintaining American economic interests.\"\n\nChevron's presence in Venezuela means it \"stands to benefit from any reopening,\" Maurizio Carulli, a global energy analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said in a Tuesday note.\n\nThe oil major has the personnel, licenses, and oil fields \"ready to ramp up immediately,\" Charles-Henry Monchau, CIO of Syz Group, also said in a note on Tuesday.\n\nIndustry analysts have warned it will take years and huge sums to revitalize Venezuela's oil sector, and US companies won't want to invest heavily until they're confident they won't have assets seized or contracts changed down the line.\n\nThat suggests Venezuela won't be an overnight game changer for Chevron or Berkshire.\n\nBerkshire has further exposure to the oil industry via Occidental Petroleum, its next-largest stock holding after Chevron. It owns more than a quarter of the energy explorer and producer — a stake worth $11 billion today.\n\nA Chevron spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement: \"Chevron remains focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets. We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\"",

    "description": "Once one of the world's richest nations, Venezuela has faced a decadeslong collapse that triggered one of the largest migrations in history.",
    "fullText": "Half a century ago, Venezuela was one of the world's richest nations. Today, decades of economic collapse have driven nearly a quarter of its population to flee the country.\n\nOn January 3, the US launched a military operation in Venezuela that resulted in the capture of President Nicolás Maduro. He pleaded not guilty to narco-terrorism and weapons-related charges in New York on Monday.\n\nThe seizure of the country's leader, which Venezuelan officials have called a \"kidnapping,\" has raised questions about sovereignty and legality, as well as Venezuela's political and economic future.\n\nThe country, which has the largest proven oil reserves in the world, estimated at about a fifth of the world's total, produces less than 1% of the global oil production today, due to what President Donald Trump has called \"badly broken infrastructure.\"\n\nUS officials have said they will seek to influence Venezuela's transitional government and attract investment from American energy companies to help revive its collapsed oil sector.\n\nDuring the 1950s and more dramatically in the 1970s, Venezuela experienced periods of vast oil-fueled economic growth — nicknamed by historians as \"Saudi Venezuela\" — where luxury, foreign travel, and modernization defined a growing middle class.\n\nAt the same time, the dramatic wealth of the era left some behind, highlighting the visible inequalities that contributed to a shift in domestic politics by the end of the century.\n\nThese vintage photos capture what life in Venezuela was like during its decades of oil-fueled economic prosperity and how the country evolved as its economy boomed.\n\nThe first oil discovery in Venezuela was made near Lake Maracaibo in 1914. The national oil industry experienced exponential growth throughout the 1920s and 1930s, as foreign investments began to pour into the country.\n\nThe oil industry's boom transformed the country's economy, which had previously primarily been a coffee exporter.\n\nThe growing oil industry concentrated jobs and investment in the country's capital, drawing migrants from rural areas and smaller cities in search of work and opportunity.\n\n\"There was a growing, expansive, and increasingly influential middle class that established itself in the oil industry,\" said Miguel Tinker Salas, a Pomona College history professor focusing on Venezuelan oil culture and society.\n\nBefore the discovery and expansion of the oil industry in the country, Venezuela was a poor and rural nation, and its economy was defined by agricultural exports, such as coffee and cacao, as reported by Mongabay. Wealth in Venezuela was predominantly held by large landowners, who formed a dominant elite.\n\nThe rapid growth of the oil industry provided the country's middle class, which was relatively small and concentrated in cities like Caracas, with an opportunity for professional expansion.\n\n\"They benefited tremendously from oil wealth and held managerial and professional positions,\" Tinker Salas told Business Insider. \"But they remained a small percentage of the population.\"\n\nHe estimates that less than 20% of the population was part of the middle class that emerged from oil growth.\n\n\"The hardware of modernity — the buildings, the architecture, the glitzy lights, and the planned development of cities — was made possible by oil,\" said Alejandro Velasco, an associate professor of Latin American history at New York University.\n\nAs oil wealth flowed into the country, urban consumer culture in Caracas and other major cities was heavily influenced by the United States. Among members of the middle and upper classes, shopping, fashion, and leisure increasingly reflected American tastes and lifestyles.\n\n\"For a particular segment of the population, they wanted to see themselves as an appendage of Miami-Dade County,\" Tinker Salas said. \"For another segment of the population, that dream was never possible.\"\n\n\"Those who had money,\" Tinker Salas said, \"could get on a plane in Caracas on a Friday afternoon, be in Miami in three hours, shop at Miami department stores, and come back on Sunday afternoon.\"\n\nCaracas also became an international hub for fashion and culture, attracting designers, models, and luxury brands from around the world.\n\nFrom 1976 to 1982, Air France operated a weekly Concorde flight between Caracas and Paris, a symbol of how closely Venezuela's elites aligned themselves with Europe during the oil boom.\n\nEconomic prosperity made luxury brands and high-end shopping popular in parts of Caracas, particularly for the country's wealthiest residents. But that consumer culture existed alongside stark economic inequality.\n\n\"You had fancy department stores and consumer culture existing side by side with deep inequality,\" Tinker Salas said.\n\nWhile the capital city remained the center of political and economic power, oil revenues also fueled development in other cities, shaping urban life across much of the country and giving more people access to \"electricity, medical services, and infrastructure that was often lacking in rural areas,\" Tinker Salas said.\n\nThroughout the century, as the agricultural industry lost its dominance of the domestic economy, the country saw increased internal migration to urban centers.\n\nThe city surrounding Lake Maracaibo, where oil was first discovered in the country, grew into Venezuela's second-largest city as oil production expanded.\n\nIts economy, identity, and growth were closely tied to oil, making the city a counterpart to Caracas during Venezuela's decades of rapid expansion.\n\nAs international companies grew their operations, Maracaibo welcomed many foreign oil workers.\n\nAs the oil industry expanded, Venezuela attracted foreign oil workers and immigrants, including Europeans during and after World War II. These arrivals helped shape the culture of the country's major cities.\n\n\"Oil exploration brought cultural influence, but Venezuela also became a destination for immigrants from Europe and across Latin America,\" Velasco said.\n\nNot every part of Venezuela was reshaped evenly during the expansion of the oil industry. As cities expanded, many rural areas continued to rely on agriculture, fishing, and local trade throughout the mid-century.\n\n\"On the surface, the country had a veneer of progress,\" Tinker Salas said. \"Venezuela had the highest standard of living in Latin America, but it also had the highest cost of living.\"\n\nWhile modern high-rises emerged in Caracas and other major cities, slums and informal settlements — or barrios — surrounding urban centers often told a different story from the luxurious, store-lined streets.\n\n\"The city was expanding and growing dramatically,\" Tinker Salas said, \"but alongside and in the shadow of those high-rise buildings were poor shacks where people lived in poverty.\"\n\nIn many neighborhoods, access to reliable water, sanitation, and other basic services remained limited even as other parts of the city modernized. Rapid urban growth during the oil era often outpaced infrastructure and long-term planning, leaving families to manage everyday shortages on their own.\n\nThe growth of informal neighborhoods surrounding major cities was a marker of internal migration patterns, where families from rural areas came to the city.\n\n\"Before the 1950s, barrios served as a kind of transitional space — people were in the city, but not fully of the city,\" Velasco said. \"There was a sense of gradual upward mobility: moving from the countryside into a barrio, then into a rented room, then eventually into a house or apartment.\"\n\n\"Even at the height of the so-called golden era, there was tremendous social, cultural, and economic disparity,\" Tinker Salas said.\n\nBetween the late 1940s and the 1950s, the dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez ruled Venezuela after rising to power during a period of political instability.\n\nHis military government utilized growing oil revenues to fund major infrastructure and modernization projects, even as political and civil freedoms were tightly restricted, reflecting a long-standing pattern of strongman rule that has shaped Venezuelan politics during the country's push toward democracy.\n\nUnder Pérez Jiménez, large public housing projects — or superblocks — were constructed in an effort to modernize the capital and reshape its working-class population. During this effort, informal settlements and barrios were razed, and their residents were forcibly relocated into high-rise complexes designed to reshape their way of life.\n\n\"People were suddenly expected to become modern residents in new spaces, and that transition was difficult,\" Velasco said.\n\nDaily life in the complexes was regulated by strict rules of conduct and state oversight. The model relied on the control of an authoritarian state, Velasco said, which ended as Venezuela moved toward democracy.\n\n\"The failure of that project produced a paradox where you have superblocks and barrios right next to each other,\" Velasco said.\n\nLinking the capital to the mountaintop Hotel Humbold, the Caracas Aerial Tramway symbolized how the state used large-scale public works to project progress, visibility, and national pride in an era that emphasized monumental infrastructure as proof of modernization.\n\nOpened in 1953 as part of a government effort to increase tourism, the Hotel Tamanaco was a key component of a broader initiative to present Venezuela as a modern, international destination.\n\nThe military dictatorship ended in early 1958, but the transition to democracy was marked by unrest, strikes, and internal divisions within the armed forces. In the months that followed, a new civilian-led government struggled to stabilize the country and respond to popular demands amid lingering uncertainty.\n\n\"The 1960s, when democracy began in Venezuela, are not a period of abundance,\" Velasco said. \"They're a period of crisis.\"\n\nDuring the early days of its democracy, Venezuela was widely perceived abroad — and promoted at home — as a stable democracy at a time when military rule was common in Latin America.\n\nHigh-profile diplomatic engagements, like the visit of US President John F. Kennedy, promoted the myth of Venezuela as an \"exceptional democracy,\" as Tinker Salas described it, even during a time when democratic regimes struggled internally.\n\n\"The myth of Venezuela as the exceptional democracy persisted because Venezuela provided the contrary example to what was happening in Cuba,\" Tinker Salas said.\n\nConstruction of the Guri Dam began in the early 1960s and continued in phases through the 1980s, reflecting a long-term effort to channel oil revenues into large-scale development projects.\n\nThe hydroelectric complex was part of a broader effort to diversify Venezuela's economy and modernize the country through investments in industry, energy, and infrastructure, extending beyond oil itself.\n\nIntroduced through US oil companies and foreign workers, baseball spread first through oil camps and industrial towns before taking root across the country.\n\nOver time, the sport moved beyond its foreign origins and became a shared cultural language, eventually emerging as one of Venezuela's most powerful symbols of national identity.\n\nAs television spread across Venezuela, variety shows and music programs introduced salsa, Caribbean rhythms, and popular performers into living rooms nationwide.\n\nLaunched in the early 1950s, the Miss Venezuela pageant grew alongside the spread of television and mass media, turning beauty competitions into nationally shared events.\n\nOver time, the pageant evolved into a symbol of national pride, representing how Venezuelans presented themselves to one another and to the world.\n\nDecades of rapid growth reshaped daily life in Venezuela, affecting everyone from rural migrants who moved into expanding cities to foreign immigrants who arrived as the country experienced unprecedented prosperity.\n\nFor those who remained in Venezuela — and for the millions who have since left — the past paints a complex picture of ambition, luxury, and inequality.",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nWhile joining the millionaire club may feel out of reach for many young Americans, the power of compounding can make it possible.\n\nIt’s simple: you invest a small sum of money each month into a low-cost index fund. When you earn dividends, you automatically reinvest those proceeds to buy more shares, and your returns grow over time.\n\nBut there’s a catch, says personal finance YouTuber Mark Tilbury: the magic only really happens after you’ve invested your first $100,000.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nGet early access to privately-held AI companies with Fundrise Venture Capital for as little as $10.

About 56% of Americans believe the cost of living is too high, according to a survey conducted by Politico last month (1).\n\nWhile it might take you longer to reach this milestone than it did previous generations, it’s still worth pursuing.\n\nHere’s why the first $100,000 is so important and how to reach it quickly.\n\nAfter you hit $100,000, “compound interest stops being lame,” according to Tilbury. “Getting that chunk of money as fast as possible is the key. [...] Once you get to this point, it’s almost inevitable that you’ll be wealthy if you just invest in a low-cost index fund.”\n\nTo get there, Tilbury suggests people follow what he calls the GROWTH method:\n\nG: Gain control of your finances.\n\nO: Optimize your tax management.\n\nT: Tap into additional income streams.\n\nGaining control of your finances is crucial for achieving long-term financial stability and reaching your goals. And according to Tilbury, there’s only one way to gain control of your finances — budgeting. Once you’ve assessed your budget, there may even be ways you can shave off some unnecessary dollars and avoid unnecessary spending.",

    "fullText": "Deal indicates Venezuelan government is responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention\n\nDonald Trump has said Venezuela will be “turning over” $2bn worth of Venezuelan crude to the United States, a flagship negotiation that would divert supplies from China while helping Venezuela avoid deeper oil production cuts.\n\n“This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!” Trump said in a post online.\n\nVenezuelan government officials and state company PDVSA did not provide comment.\n\nVenezuela has millions of barrels of oil loaded on tankers and in storage tanks that it has been unable to ship due to the blockade imposed by Trump, as part of the pressure campaign that culminated in the toppling of Nicolás Maduro who was seized from his country by US forces over the weekend.\n\nTop Venezuelan officials have called Maduro’s capture a kidnapping and accused the US of trying to steal the country’s vast oil reserver, however Tuesday’s agreement is a strong sign that the government is responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention.\n\nTrump has said he wants interim president Delcy Rodríguez to give the US and private companies “total access” to Venezuela’s oil industry.\n\nUS energy secretary Chris Wright is in charge of executing the deal, Trump said, adding that the oil will be taken from ships and sent directly to US ports. Supplying the trapped crude to the US could initially require reallocating cargoes originally bound for China, two sources had told Reuters earlier on Tuesday.\n\nChina has been Venezuela’s top buyer in the last decade and especially since the United States imposed sanctions on companies involved in oil trade with Venezuela in 2020.\n\nUS crude prices fell more than 1.5% after Trump’s announcement, with the agreement expected to increase the volume of Venezuelan oil exported to the US. That flow of oil is currently controlled entirely by Chevron, PDVSA’s main joint venture partner, under a US authorisation.\n\nChevron, which has been exporting between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan oil to the US, is the only company that has been loading and shipping crude without interruption from the South American country in recent weeks under the blockade.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Venezuela would have any access to proceeds from the supply. Sanctions mean PDVSA is excluded from the global financial system, its bank accounts are frozen and it is blocked from executing transactions in US dollars\n\nHours before Trump’s announcement on Tuesday, Rodríguez hardened her tone against the US, saying in a televised address that “no external agent governs Venezuela” – a clear rebuttal to the US president’s claim that, after the capture of Maduro, the US would now run the South American country.\n\nIt marked another shift in tone from Maduro’s former vice-president. After being sworn in as president by Venezuela’s supreme court on Saturday, Rodríguez released a conciliatory statement late on Sunday in which she “invited the US government to work together on an agenda of cooperation”.\n\nIn Tuesday’s address, however, Rodríguez reverted to harsher language, describing Saturday’s strike – the first large-scale US military operation on South American soil – as a “terrible military aggression” and a “criminal attack” whose “absolutely illegal outcome, in violation of international law”, was the “kidnapping” of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.\n\n“We are a people who do not surrender, who do not give up, and we are here, governing together with the people. The government of Venezuela rules in our country – no one else. There is no external agent governing Venezuela. It is Venezuela, its constitutional government, and the consolidated power of the people,” said Rodríguez, who had served as Maduro’s vice-president since 2018.",

    "fullText": "Not all American energy companies stand to benefit from a potential revival of Venezuela's oil industry following the US's capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.\n\nEnergy stocks rose on Monday as investors priced in potential gains from renewed US access to Venezuela's massive oil reserves. But analysts say smaller companies could struggle to benefit from a recovery in the country's energy sector.\n\nAdditional Venezuelan oil supply over the coming years could be \"negative for shale producers\" that don't have a footprint in Venezuela, Daan Struyven, the head of oil research at Goldman Sachs, said on the firm's \"Exchanges\" podcast, published on Tuesday.\n\nThat's because prices and volumes could come under pressure if supply growth over the next five to 10 years comes from Venezuela rather than from US shale, he added.\n\nThe potential strain on shale reflects a key difference in oil quality. Venezuelan crude is heavy and sulfur-rich, while US shale production is dominated by lighter oil. Many US Gulf Coast refineries were originally designed to process heavier crude, making Venezuelan barrels a better fit.\n\nGreater access to Venezuelan crude could therefore benefit refiners while undermining demand for lighter shale barrels.\n\nWhile light shale oil and heavy crude like Venezuela's are not directly interchangeable, increased supplies of heavy oil can still reshape refinery demand and pricing across the broader market. That kind of change would indirectly pressure US shale producers, who have long been the engine of America's shale revolution.\n\n\"In the US, the first casualties would likely be some oil producers, particularly smaller shale firms with high debt and thin margins,\" Philippe Le Billon, a professor at the University of British Columbia who studies the political economy of natural resources, wrote in The Conversation on Sunday.\n\nFurthermore, oil prices have already been under pressure in recent years due to ample supply and sluggish demand growth.\n\nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude futures are trading around $56 a barrel, while Brent futures are around $60 a barrel. Both are down around 2% so far this year after falling 20% last year.\n\nEven an increase in Venezuela's oil production in the medium term could put downward pressure on oil prices, making it harder for higher-cost US shale producers to justify new drilling, researchers at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy said in a Sunday post.\n\nThat dynamic could intensify the pressure on US shale producers.\n\n\"This complicates the notion that the US would unambiguously 'win' from a Venezuelan oil revival. Energy geopolitics creates winners and losers on all sides,\" wrote Le Billon.",

    "fullText": "Jan 6 (Reuters) - Venezuela was loading crude only for U.S. major Chevron on Tuesday, while operations by state-run oil firm PDVSA to load cargoes for its main customers in China ​remained on hold for a fifth day, shipping data showed.\n\nU.S. forces captured President Nicolas Maduro on ‌Saturday and took him to New York to face drug charges. Interim President Delcy Rodriguez is now running the government, which the U.S. ‌has said it will oversee.\n\nThe United States imposed a blockade on sanctioned oil tankers sailing into and out of Venezuelan waters last month, which halted most exports other than those destined for Chevron.\n\nChevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in the country under a U.S. license that exempts it from sanctions imposed by Washington on Venezuela's oil industry ⁠to choke off revenue that financed Maduro's ‌government.\n\nOn Tuesday, several vessels chartered by Chevron were the only ones loading crude for export at Venezuela's Jose and Bajo Grande ports, ship monitoring data showed.\n\nOther ships were loading ‍either to move oil between domestic ports or to store crude because onshore storage was almost completely full, according to PDVSA's internal documents.\n\nThe last crude cargo that was loaded for an Asian customer at Jose finished loading on January 1, according to ​the data and documents. Without more exports, PDVSA could be forced to deepen production cuts it began in ‌recent days because storage tanks are full.\n\nChevron on Monday resumed exports of Venezuelan oil to the U.S. after a four-day pause and called workers abroad back to its Venezuelan offices as flights to the country restarted. The U.S. firm has emerged in recent weeks as the only company fluidly exporting Venezuela's crude.\n\nAt least a dozen vessels under sanctions that had loaded in December and had been stuck in Venezuela's waters due to the embargo sailed in ⁠early January.\n\nThose vessels were carrying around 12 million barrels of ​crude and fuel. It was unclear where the vessels were heading, ​although they were initially loaded for customers in China. The ships left in \"dark mode,\" which means that transponders that send out their location were switched off. The vessels appeared to break ‍the U.S. tanker blockade.\n\nThe U.S. ⁠government has not commented on the vessels or whether it authorized the departures. PDVSA has not replied to a request for comment. Chevron said this week it continues to operate \"in full compliance with all relevant ⁠laws and regulations.\"",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces used long-range, deep-strike drones to hit a Russian missile arsenal and oil depot supporting the invasion, a security official told Business Insider on Tuesday.\n\nThe attacks mark Ukraine's latest deep strikes as it continues to target Russian weapons and the country's vast energy sector, a major revenue source for the state as it wages war.\n\nA source in the Security Service of Ukraine, the SBU, said that drones hit Russia's 100th Main Missile and Artillery Directorate (GRAU) in the western Kostroma region. They were only authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss military developments.\n\nThe drone attack on the facility triggered a secondary detonation of ammunition, causing powerful blasts at the facility, the source said, calling it an important target because Russia uses it to supply munitions to smaller sites in other areas of the country.\n\nThe source said drones also struck an oil depot in the nearby Lipetsk region, sparking an \"intense\" blaze. Video footage and images shared on social media appeared to show fire and smoke at the two facilities.\n\nOvernight, Ukrainian attack drones successfully hit a Russian oil depot in the town of Usman, Lipetsk Oblast. Seen here, flames leap into the night sky from the burning facility. pic.twitter.com/EN6SRI2sXU\n\nRussia's defense ministry said on Tuesday that it shot down 360 Ukrainian drones without specifying where. Neither the ministry nor the Russian embassy in the US responded to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nThe SBU source said that the two drone attacks were carried out by its Alpha group, an elite \"spetsnaz\" unit considered to be among the best of Ukraine's special forces.\n\nThe Alpha group regularly carries out long-range drone attacks against Russian targets, including a recent first-of-its-kind strike on a Moscow-linked oil tanker in the Mediterranean Sea and the stunning June attacks against Russian airbases, known as Operation Spiderweb.\n\nThe SBU's Alpha forces also carry out ground operations; for instance, they have participated in Ukraine's defense of Pokrovsk, the war-torn city in the eastern Donetsk region that has been the site of some of the conflict's most intense fighting.\n\n\"In the New Year, the SBU continues to work successfully on military and oil facilities of the Russian Federation, reducing the enemy's ability to provide their army with ammunition and fuel,\" the source said in translated remarks shared with Business Insider.\n\n\"All Russian rear facilities that work for the war against Ukraine are absolutely legitimate targets,\" they added.\n\nSince August, Ukraine has stepped up its use of long-range drones to attack Russian energy facilities in a bid to put pressure on a key source of revenue for Moscow that helps fuel its war efforts.\n\nUkraine has mostly targeted oil and gas infrastructure on land, such as depots and ports, but in recent weeks, it has expanded attacks to maritime targets, striking several oil tankers and oil platforms in the Black, Caspian, and Mediterranean seas.\n\nUkrainian officials have described the deep-strike operations as the country's way of imposing \"long-range\" sanctions on Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, Tuesday's attack on the 100th GRAU arsenal reflects a tactic that Ukraine has long relied on — hitting ammunition storage sites inside Russia to cause more near-term battlefield impacts.",

    "fullText": "President says a ‘tremendous amount of money’ will need to be spent repairing country’s infrastructure\n\nWhy Venezuelan crude appeals to US refineries\n\nVenezuela live – latest updates\n\nDonald Trump has suggested US taxpayers could reimburse energy companies for repairing Venezuelan infrastructure for extracting and shipping oil.\n\nTrump acknowledged that “a lot of money” would need to be spent to increase oil production in Venezuela after US forces ousted its leader, Nicolás Maduro, but suggested his government could pay oil companies to do the work.\n\n“A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent and the oil companies will spend it, and then they’ll get reimbursed by us or through revenue,” the president said.\n\nThe US energy secretary, Chris Wright, reportedly plans to meet representatives of Chevron, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil at the Goldman Sachs Energy, Clean Tech & Utilities Conference in Miami later this week.\n\nRepresentatives of Trump’s administration are planning to meet executives to discuss increasing Venezuelan production, Reuters reported.\n\nThe meetings are crucial to the Trump administration’s hopes of getting top oil companies back into the South American nation after its government, nearly two decades ago, took control of US-led energy operations there.\n\nThe three biggest US oil companies – Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron – have not yet had any conversations with the administration about Maduro’s removal, Reuters reported. This contradicted Trump’s statements over the weekend that he had already held meetings with “all” the US oil companies, before and since Maduro was seized.\n\n“Nobody in those three companies has had conversations with the White House about operating in Venezuela, pre-removal or post-removal to this point,” one of the sources told Reuters.\n\nThe upcoming meetings will be crucial to the administration’s hopes to increase production and exports of heavy, unctuous crude from Venezuela, a former Opec nation that sits atop the world’s largest reserves and whose barrels can be processed by specially designed US refineries.\n\nAchieving that goal will require years of work and billions of dollars of investment, analysts say.\n\nVenezuela produces on average about 1.1m barrels of oil a day, down from the 3.5m barrels produced in 1999 before a government takeover of the domestic industry.\n\nIt is unclear which executives will be attending the upcoming meetings, and whether oil companies will be attending individually or collectively.\n\nThe White House did not comment on the meetings but said it believed the US oil industry was ready to move in to Venezuela.\n\n“All of our oil companies are ready and willing to make big investments in Venezuela that will rebuild their oil infrastructure, which was destroyed by the illegitimate Maduro regime,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.\n\nExxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips did not immediately respond to requests for comment to Reuters.\n\nAsked if the administration had briefed any oil companies before the military operation, Trump said, “No. But we’ve been talking to the concept of, ‘what if we did it?’”\n\n“The oil companies were absolutely aware that we were thinking about doing something,” Trump told NBC News. “But we didn’t tell them we were going to do it.”\n\nHe told NBC News it was “too soon” to say whether he had personally spoken to top executives at the three companies. “I speak to everybody,” he said.\n\nTrump said hours after Maduro’s capture he expects the biggest US oil companies to spend billions of dollars increase Venezuela’s oil production, after it dropped to about a third of its peak over the past two decades because of underinvestment and sanctions.\n\nBut those plans will be hindered by lack of infrastructure, along with deep uncertainty over the country’s political future, legal framework and long-term US policy, according to industry analysts.\n\nChevron is the only US major operating in Venezuela’s oilfields. Exxon and ConocoPhillips operated in the country before their projects were nationalised by former president Hugo Chávez.\n\nThe S&P 500 energy index rose to its highest since March 2025 on Monday, as Exxon Mobil rose 2.2% and Chevron jumped 5.1%.",

    "fullText": "If the US operation in Venezuela tells us anything, it’s that Washington is thinking past the shale boom and back to a more traditional playbook: secure access to oil abroad when supply at home looks less assured.\n\nStart with the numbers. The US Energy Information Administration expects US crude output to dip slightly in 2026, after several years of growth. That’s not a collapse. But it matters politically because shale is a treadmill: production stability depends on constant reinvestment, which in turn depends on price. Top-tier shale sites can work at lower prices, but meaningfully higher prices are required to profitably drill new wells.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Venezuela looks like a long-term option the US doesn’t want to leave to rivals. Recent reporting around the crisis frames the push as one where US oil firms are being invited back into a country with the world’s largest stated reserves, but a degraded industry, an opportunity some analysts describe as a “poisoned chalice,” with extra-heavy Venezuelan supply requiring high prices and heavy upfront investment to scale.\n\nThat brings us to the uncomfortable inference: This is oil security dressed up as strategy. And it hints at a return to a familiar American pattern — political interference in petrostates — that felt less central in the 2014-2024 period when shale growth and surging exports reduced the urgency of “barrels at any cost.”\n\nOil has often been the subtext of US foreign policy. The 1953 coup in Iran followed the nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The point is not that “one company did it,” but that energy interests and state power intertwine when strategic supply appears at stake.\n\nToday, the corporate “face” of the Venezuela file is Chevron, not because it “controls” US policy, but because it sits at the chokepoint. With sanctions and licensing, Chevron has effectively become a valve, a channel through which some Venezuelan crude can still reach the US.\n\nThere’s also a quieter, very practical reason Venezuela matters: refinery physics. US shale is mostly light sweet. Venezuela’s flagship exports are often heavy sour. These are not interchangeable. What Venezuela can do, quickly, is redirect heavy barrels back to US Gulf Coast refineries that are built to run them — exactly the kind of trade shift that also happens to reduce China’s access to discounted sanctioned crude. For Washington, that China angle is a bonus argument, not the core driver.\n\nBut let’s be clear-eyed about the limits. Venezuela’s oil is hard to produce. Even optimistic investment roadmaps talk in multiyear timelines. So anyone expecting a fast flood of supply is likely to be disappointed. Even the reserve story is not simple. Venezuela may top the charts on paper, but “proved reserves” are an economic classification as much as a geological one.\n\nThat’s the deeper point for markets: Supply growth is not just about claimed resources. It’s about prices, production technology, political stability, know-how, and logistics.\n\nIf all of this is telling us anything, it’s that higher oil prices in the future may be needed to offset decline dynamics in both shale and extra-heavy oil provinces like Venezuela. Washington may be trying to secure additional future supply to cap price spikes, but that won’t be easy, and it won’t be quick.\n\nOPEC in a Shale Oil World: Where to Next?\n\nThe “Donroe Doctrine” gives Washington control of nearly 40% of the world oil output, and with it the power to keep crude prices close to $50 a barrel, writes Bloomberg Opinion’s Javier Blas.",

    "description": "Peter Krull, director of Earth Equity Advisors, discusses why he's bullish on renewable energy and shares his top clean energy stock picks.",
    "fullText": "Clean energy faced headwinds in 2025 as the White House prioritized fossil fuels, but the market showed remarkable resilience, which one investor thinks is set to boost renewable stocks further in 2026.\n\nAfter being buffeted by uncertainty related to energy policy changes in Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill, solar and other clean power stocks did remarkably well in 2025. The S&P Global Clean Energy Transition index is up 46% in the last year, compared to 16% for the broader S&P 500.\n\nPeter Krull, the former CEO and now director of Earth Equity Advisors, a sustainable investment firm and advisory with more than $150 million in assets, thinks that streak of outperformance could continue. With 2026 underway, he predicts certain clean energy stocks are poised to continue rising, even as uncertainty lingers.\n\nIn his view, the clean energy transformation that has been taking place for years will continue. He sees it starting to reshape markets such as infrastructure and transportation in 2026, ushering in a new wave of growth for the companies helping lay the foundation for a new phase of industrial development.\n\n\"I continue to be bullish on renewable energy both for the long and short-term,\" Krull told Business Insider. \"Climate change is pushing all economies to adopt cleaner energy, transportation, and real estate systems.\"\n\nHere are his top clean energy stocks to buy this year.\n\nCommentary: This electrical infrastructure company may not be well known outside its industry, but Krull sees it as a strategic play on an extremely important industry. MYR Group is coming off a strong year, and he thinks it will continue making progress in 2026 as demand increases due to the ongoing AI boom.\n\n\"Between the clean energy transition and the AI buildout, we're going to need to move electrons efficiently across the country,\" he said. \"MYR designs and builds transmission lines to meet the ever-growing demand for more electricity. I see continued growth for at least the next decade in their services.\"\n\nCommentary: While not a direct clean energy play, Recursion Pharmaceuticals is known for prioritizing sustainability in its operations. Krull remains highly bullish on the stock, citing the potential for AI to help transform the world of biotechnology and pharmaceutical development.\n\n\"Recursion teamed up with Nvidia to build a supercomputer to analyze potential drug opportunities. The analysis performed by the Recursion system has the potential to speed up the drug development process and reduce the cost of development by half.\n\nKrull said that while he views Recursion as a riskier play than the other clean energy stocks on his list, he still sees high upside potential.\n\nCommentary: First Solar is a leader in the solar technology space, a key component of the clean energy sector. The stock performed well in 2025, and Krull maintains that its growth is still in its early stages as the company prepares to continue expanding its empire in 2026.\n\n\"They are focused on innovation in the solar manufacturing space, investing in clean manufacturing and higher cell efficiency,\" Krull noted. \"The company has a year-long backlog and is sold out through 2026.\"\n\nCommentary: Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure invests in sustainable infrastructure companies, specifically those in the renewable energy space, such as solar and wind power firms. Krull sees this as a lucrative niche that will pay off as clean energy demand rises.\n\n\"There will be more opportunities to build out our renewable energy systems, and companies like Hannon Armstrong will be vital for financing,\" he predicted.\n\nCommentary: This electric vehicle producer rebounded in 2025 after shaking off significant volatility. Krull thinks that Rivian is poised to emerge stronger than ever in 2026, even as the EV market faces uncertainty.\n\nKrull thinks the automaker is well-positioned to serve a section of the market that industry leader Tesla hasn't focused on.\n\n\"Their anticipated R3 models will be in the lower-end EV market, a market Tesla doesn't seem to be targeting,\" he said of Rivian. \"Their CEO, R.J. Scaringe, is brilliant; he understands the importance of connected and integrated systems in EVs.\"",

Experts have said that the move could reshape the global energy market, disadvantaging China and Russia.\n\n\"They were pumping almost nothing by comparison to what they could have been,\" Trump said in a public address.\n\nTrump's comments followed an early Saturday raid in which US armed forces and law enforcement struck parts of the capital, Caracas, and captured Maduro and his wife.\n\nIn Monday's NBC interview, Trump said, \"Having a Venezuela that's an oil producer is good for the United States because it keeps the price of oil down.\"\n\nLower oil prices could mean cheaper gas for average Americans, but may also disincentivize the \"very large United States oil companies\" that Trump said he may subsidize.\n\nTrump added it was \"too soon\" to say whether he had spoken to executives at Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips, America's three largest oil producers.\n\nThe oil market has been under pressure, with crude prices falling 20% last year. A main issue facing the market is an oversupply of global crude because of sluggish demand.

    "fullText": "Jan 5 (Reuters) - About a dozen oil tankers loaded with Venezuelan crude and fuel have left the country's waters since the start of the year in apparent defiance of the U.S. government's blockade on exports, according to documents seen by Reuters and industry sources including monitoring service TankerTrackers.com.\n\nU.S. President Donald ​Trump imposed a blockade of all sanctioned tankers bound for Venezuela in mid-December, before the dramatic capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by U.S. troops in ‌the early hours of Saturday morning. Trump said on Saturday that an oil embargo remained in full force after Maduro's extraction.\n\nAll the departed vessels identified are under sanctions and most are now sailing on the high seas ‌without any known flag or current ship safety documentation in place, shipping data showed. Half of them are supertankers that typically carry Venezuelan crude to China, according to TankerTrackers.com and shipping documents from PDVSA.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the U.S. had approved or allowed the shipments. Trump also said on Saturday that Venezuela's largest customers, including China, would keep receiving oil.\n\nA U.S. official told Reuters on Monday the vessel \"quarantine\" was in effect focused on sanctioned tankers, but did not elaborate on the departed ships.\n\nThe White House, the U.S. State Department, state-run Venezuelan oil company PDVSA ⁠and Venezuela's oil ministry did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe ‌vessels are carrying an estimated volume of 12 million barrels of Venezuelan heavy crude and fuel oil, according to deals negotiated with PDVSA and satellite images analyzed by TankerTrackers.com.\n\nIt was unclear where the vessels were heading. When they loaded in December, they were mostly destined for Asia. ‍The ships had been stuck in Venezuelan waters since due to the U.S. blockade.\n\nA separate group of three smaller empty ships, also under sanctions, left the country after completing domestic trips or discharging imports, including of Russian naphtha.\n\nAt least four of the departed tankers left Venezuelan waters on Saturday through a route north of Margarita island after briefly stopping near the country's maritime border, TankerTrackers.com said.\n\nAt least four supertankers ​had been cleared by Venezuelan authorities to leave in dark mode, three sources with knowledge of the departure paperwork told Reuters. That means the vessels sail without their ‌satellite tracking devices switched on, a common ploy for tankers in the global fleet that carry sanctioned oil from Venezuela, Iran and Russia around the world.",

    "fullText": "Michael Burry says the US raid on Venezuela is a much bigger deal than the markets' muted reaction suggests.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame, who recently pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack, published a post early Monday saying the \"game just changed\" in the mid to long term, and \"markets are not pricing in all that may come of this weekend's events.\"\n\n\"This is a paradigm shift despite the markets yawning,\" he later wrote on X.\n\nBenchmark oil prices climbed less than 1% on Monday, and US stock futures opened higher, after the US captured President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend and President Trump said America would \"run\" the oil-rich country for the time being.\n\nThe seizure was a \"shot across China's bow,\" Burry wrote, pointing to billions of dollars in loans that China has made to Venezuela under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which were collateralized using future oil output that is \"now in US hands.\"\n\nThe investor, who shot to fame after his prescient bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble was featured in the book and movie \"The Big Short,\" wrote that China may now have a \"blueprint\" for how to take control of Taiwan, but \"must be in awe of Trumpian America's infuriating gall and decisive power.\"\n\nBurry said that China stocks strike him as \"somewhat riskier\" now in terms of running afoul of sanctions. He wrote that Alibaba, Baidu, and other potential sanction targets \"could be in for some volatility\" if China escalates its aggression in the South China Sea or targets Taiwan.\n\nThe contrarian bargain hunter also wrote that \"Putin's jaw has to be on the floor\" after the US did in \"practically seconds\" what Russia has been trying to do in Ukraine for three years.\n\nHe added that Russian oil \"just became less important\" in the mid to long term, as tapping Venezuelan oil could strengthen the US and \"reduce Russia's income and power.\"\n\nBurry also suggested that Canada and Mexico could \"lose a good amount of leverage\" in trade with the US if American refineries switch out Canadian crude for Venezuelan oil.\n\nThe veteran investor also said US oil-services companies such as Halliburton, Schlumberger, and Baker Hughes \"should benefit significantly\" as US contractors will be tasked with fixing and modernizing Venezuela's pipelines and refineries.\n\nBurry also forecast a \"long term tailwind\" for the US as inflows of Venezuelan oil will mean gas, diesel, and jet fuel prices will drop. He said that could push down prices to the benefit of consumers, especially lower-income ones, cut supply chain costs, and ease some uncertainty about the future for business owners.",

    "fullText": "Energy stocks soared Monday as investors wagered the US raid on Venezuela would pay off handsomely for the oil industry and related sectors.\n\nShares of both Halliburton and SLB — formerly Schlumberger — jumped more than 11% in morning trading, while Baker Hughes leaped 5%. Valero climbed 9%, Chevron gained 5%, and ConocoPhillips was up around 3% as of 12:30 p.m. ET.\n\nThose gains helped fuel a 1.5% rise in the Dow Jones, as well as 0.7% rises in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.\n\nAsian and European stocks rose, with Germany's DAX closing up 1.3% and China's Shanghai Composite ending the day 2.2% higher. Among the biggest gainers were defense companies, including Germany's Rheinmetall, up 9.3%, and Britain's BAE Systems, up 5.5%.\n\nThe US captured Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, in a military operation over the weekend. President Donald Trump has said that America will \"run\" the oil-rich country for the near future, and big US companies will come in to fix and update its dilapidated energy infrastructure.\n\nAs of 12:30 p.m. ET, gold had gained 2.9% to trade around $4,450, while silver rallied 8% to roughly $76.75. Copper, platinum, and palladium all rose by 5% or more.\n\nRuss Mould, AJ Bell's investment director, said in a morning note that investors were \"hedging their bets by increasing exposure to assets with supposed haven qualities.\"\n\nThe two main crude oil benchmarks, West Texas Intermediate and Brent, rose 1.7% and 1.6% respectively.\n\nSeveral analysts said that, assuming the US maintains control of Venezuela, it will take years to fix and upgrade its pipelines and refineries, so there probably won't be a material impact on global oil flows for a while.\n\nMould said that \"short-term, there is unlikely to be a flood of new supply due to sanctions, blockades and likely hesitation by oil majors over committing large amounts of money in a country undergoing geopolitical turbulence.\"\n\nAllen Good, Morningstar's director of equity research, said in a morning note that given the high costs and regulatory risks, the \"possibility of US companies developing Venezuela's oil reserves remains far from certain.\"\n\nOther close watchers predicted a broad economic boost in the years ahead.\n\nDaniel Casali, Evelyn Partners' chief investment strategist, said the US tapping Venezuelan oil could help it to \"lower inflation, boost real incomes, and support stronger consumption growth, providing a positive impulse to the global economy that should benefit stocks.\"\n\nMichael Burry, the investor of \"The Big Short\" fame, wrote in a Substack post on Monday that harnessing Venezuela's oil output could push down prices and supply chain costs in the US, and provide more certainty for businesses. He also said the raid had \"changed the game\" as it could bolster America's standing relative to China, Russia, Canada, and Mexico.",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — As uncertainty simmers in Venezuela, interim President Delcy Rodríguez has taken the place of her ally President Nicolás Maduro, captured by the United States in a nighttime military operation, and offered “to collaborate” with the Trump administration in what could be a seismic shift in relations between the adversary governments.\n\nRodríguez served as Maduro's vice president since 2018, overseeing much of Venezuela’s oil-dependent economy and its feared intelligence service, and was next in the presidential line of succession.\n\nShe's part of a band of senior officials in Maduro's administration that now appears to control Venezuela, even as U.S. President Donald Trump and other officials say they will pressure the government to fall in line with its vision for the oil-rich nation.\n\nOn Saturday, Venezuela’s high court ordered her to assume the role of interim president, and the leader was backed by Venezuela’s military.\n\nRodríguez, a 56-year-old lawyer and politician has had a lengthy career representing the revolution started by the late Hugo Chávez on the world stage. It's been unclear if the leader would warm up to the Trump administration or follow the same adversarial line as her predecessor.\n\nHer rise to become interim leader of the South American country came as a surprise on Saturday morning, when Trump announced that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been in communication with Rodríguez and that the Venezuelan leader was “gracious” and would work with the American government. Rubio said Rodríguez was someone the administration could work with, unlike Maduro.\n\nBut in a televised address, Rodríguez gave no indication that she would cooperate with Trump, referring to his government as “extremists\" and maintaining that Maduro was Venezuela's rightful leader.\n\n“What is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,” Rodríguez said, surrounded by high-ranking civilian officials and military leaders.\n\nTrump warned on Sunday, if Rodríguez didn't fall in line, “she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.” He added that he wanted her to provide “total access,” from oil facilities to basic infrastructure like roads, so they can be rebuilt.\n\nTrump’s comments also followed Rubio having asserted in TV interviews on Sunday that he didn’t see Rodríguez and her government as “legitimate” because he said the country never held free and fair elections.\n\nOn Sunday, in statements posted to her Instagram, she took a major shift in tone in a conciliatory message where she said she hoped to build “respectful relations” with Trump.\n\n“We invite the US government to collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation oriented towards shared development within the framework of international law to strengthen lasting community coexistence,” she wrote.\n\nA lawyer educated in Britain and France, the interim president and her brother, Jorge Rodríguez, head of the Maduro-controlled National Assembly, have sterling leftist credentials born from tragedy. Their father was a socialist leader who was arrested for his involvement in the kidnapping of American business owner William Niehous in 1976, and later died in police custody.\n\nUnlike many in Maduro’s inner circle, the Rodríguez siblings have avoided criminal indictment in the U.S., though the interim president did face U.S. sanctions during Trump's first term for her role in undermining Venezuelan democracy.\n\nRodríguez held a number of lower-level positions under Chávez's government, but gained prominence working under Maduro to the point of being seen as his successor. She served the economic minister, foreign affairs minister, petroleum minister and others help stabilize Venezuela's endemically crisis-stricken economy after years of rampant inflation and turmoil.\n\nRodríguez developed strong ties with Republicans in the oil industry and on Wall Street who balked at the notion of U.S.-led regime change. The interim president also presided over an assembly promoted by Maduro in response to street protests in 2017 meant to neutralize the opposition-majority legislature.\n\nShe enjoys a close relationship with the military, which has long acted as the arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela, said Ronal Rodríguez, a spokesperson for the Venezuela Observatory of Rosario University in Bogota, Colombia.\n\n“She has a very particular relationship with power,” he said. “She has developed very strong ties with elements of the armed forces and has managed to establish lines of dialogue with them, largely on a transactional basis.”\n\nIt's unclear how long Rodríguez will hold power, or how closely she will work with the Trump administration.\n\nGeoff Ramsey, a senior nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council, a Washington research institute, said Rodríguez's initially firm tone with the Trump administration may have been an attempt to “save face.” Others have noted that Maduro's capture required some level of collaboration within the Venezuelan government.\n\n“She can’t exactly expect to score points with her revolutionary peers if she presents herself as a patsy for U.S. interests,\" Ramsey said.\n\nVenezuela’s constitution requires an election within 30 days whenever the president becomes “permanently unavailable” to serve. Reasons listed include death, resignation, removal from office or “abandonment” of duties as declared by the National Assembly.\n\nThat electoral timeline was rigorously followed when Maduro’s predecessor, Chavez, died of cancer in 2013. However, the loyalist Supreme Court, in its decision Saturday, cited another provision of the charter in declaring Maduro’s absence a “temporary” one.\n\nIn such a scenario, there is no election requirement. Instead, the vice president, an unelected position, takes over for up to 90 days — a period that can be extended to six months with a vote of the National Assembly.\n\nIn handing temporary power to Rodríguez, the Supreme Court made no mention of the 180-day time limit, leading some to speculate she could try to remain in power even longer as she seeks to unite the disparate factions of the ruling socialist party while shielding it from what would certainly be a stiff electoral challenge.\n\n—— Janetsky reported from Mexico City and Debre reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

    "description": "The oil market was already under pressure before the latest development, with crude futures falling 20% last year.",
    "fullText": "Oil futures fluctuated between gains and losses in the first trading day since the US captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro over the weekend.\n\nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures fell as much as 1.4% in the opening hour of trading before moving sideways. They were 0.5% lower at $57.01 at midnight on Monday.\n\nInternational benchmark Brent crude futures were 0.4% lower at $60.50 a barrel after falling as much as 1.4% in early trade.\n\nThe oil market has been under pressure, with crude prices falling 20% last year. A main issue facing the market is an oversupply of global crude. It's been a focus of OPEC+, which also over the weekend said it will refrain from pumping new oil during the first quarter.\n\nDespite Venezuela's vast oil reserves — estimated at about one-fifth of the global total — the country's output accounts for less than 1% of global daily oil production, reflecting years of aging infrastructure and the impact of sanctions.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, President Donald Trump said on Saturday that US oil companies will invest billions of dollars in Venezuela.\n\nIf Venezuelan oil production does pick up, analysts say it could take time and big money.\n\n\"It will take tens of billions of dollars in investment and at least a decade of Western oil majors committing to the country,\" wrote Peter McNally, the global head of sector analysts at research firm Third Bridge, on Sunday.\n\nMcNally added that there are no swift solutions for Venezuela, where years of underinvestment have eroded infrastructure across the economy, and a severe power crisis continues to disrupt daily life.\n\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs echoed that view in a Sunday note, writing that \"higher recovery rates of heavy Venezuela oil will likely require financial and time investments in oil-processing upgraders and improvements in operational efficiencies, power availability, and oil transporting infrastructure.\"\n\nVenezuela produced around 3 million barrels a day of oil at its peak in the mid-2000s.\n\nEven before the US captured Maduro, Venezuela's oil exports had already come under pressure after Trump imposed a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuelan waters last month. The blockade remains in place.\n\nGoldman Sachs said the latest developments increase the likelihood of a shift toward a policy environment more supportive of oil investment, even as short-term changes to oil flows — including both modest increases and further disruptions — remain possible.\n\nThe developments are negative for oil prices over the long run, as any sustained increase in Venezuelan output would add to already ample supply at a time of slowing demand growth, according to Goldman.\n\n\"Production may edge up slightly in the short-run, including in a scenario with a US-supported government and full sanctions relief. Alternatively, disruptions to Venezuela oil deliveries could continue and/or intensify in the short-run, for instance because Maduro's cabinet has asserted its control,\" wrote Goldman's analysts.\n\nGoldman estimates WTI and Brent to average $51 a barrel and $58 a barrel, respectively, should Venezuelan crude production fall by 400,000 barrels a day by the end of 2026.\n\nShould the country's crude production rise by 400,000 barrels a day instead, WTI and Brent are expected to average $50 a barrel and $54 a barrel, respectively, in 2026, the analysts added.",

    "fullText": "American oil companies have long hoped to recover the assets that Venezuela’s authoritarian regime ripped from them decades ago.\n\nNow the Trump administration is offering to help them achieve that aim — with one major condition.\n\nAdministration officials have told oil executives in recent weeks that if they want compensation for their rigs, pipelines and other seized property, then they must be prepared to go back into Venezuela now and invest heavily in reviving its shattered petroleum industry, two people familiar with the administration's outreach told POLITICO on Saturday. The outlook for Venezuela’s shattered oil infrastructure is one of the major questions following the U.S. military action that captured leader Nicolás Maduro.\n\nBut people in the industry said the administration’s message has left them still leery about the difficulty of rebuilding decayed oil fields in a country where it’s not even clear who will lead the country for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"They're saying, ‘you gotta go in if you want to play and get reimbursed,’\" said one industry official familiar with the conversations.\n\nThe offer has been on the table for the last 10 days, the person said. “But the infrastructure currently there is so dilapidated that no one at these companies can adequately assess what is needed to make it operable.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump suggested in a televised address Saturday morning that he fully expects U.S. oil companies to pour big money into Venezuela.\n\n“We're going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure and start making money for the country,\" Trump said as he celebrated Maduro’s capture.\n\nIt’s been five decades since the Venezuelan government first nationalized the oil industry and nearly 20 years since former President Hugo Chávez expanded the asset seizures. The country has some of the largest oil reserves in the world, but its petroleum infrastructure has decayed amid years of mismanagement and meager investment.\n\nInitial thoughts among U.S. oil industry officials and market analysts who spoke to POLITICO regarding a post-Maduro Venezuela focused more on questions than answers.\n\nThe administration has so far not laid out what its long-term plan looks like, or even if it has one, said Bob McNally, a former national security and energy adviser to President George W. Bush who now leads the energy and geopolitics consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group.\n\n“It’s not clear there’s been a specific plan beyond the principal decision that in a post-Maduro, Trump-compliant regime that the U.S. companies — energy and others — will be at the top of the list” to reenter the country, McNally said. He added: “What the regime looks like, what the plans are for getting there, that has not been fully fleshed out yet.”",

    "description": "Venezuela has the world’s largest oil reserves, but “our people don’t even have gas even to cook. That’s a disaster,” María Corina Machado told Fortune last year.",
    "fullText": "Months before the U.S. military arrested Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro, opposition leader María Corina Machado called for what she described as the most ambitious economic transformation in the nation’s history—a sweeping privatization aimed at reversing his policies and what she calls “the disaster this socialist system has wrought.”\n\nAppearing virtually on the Fortune Global Forum stage in Riyadh, Machado, while in hiding from the Maduro regime, unveiled a bold vision to rebuild Venezuela’s shattered economy through large-scale private investment.\n\n“Venezuela will be the single biggest economic opportunity for decades to come in this region,” she told Fortune’s Diane Brady at the forum’s 2025 edition, weeks after winning the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for her decades-long fight to restore democracy to Venezuela. “We’re talking about an opportunity, business opportunity, of more than $1.7 trillion. This is unique.” Machado has floated the $1.7 trillion figure before, an estimate produced by her economic advisory team.\n\nMachado painted a stark picture of a nation that has plummeted from prosperity to poverty: “a country that used to be the richest country in our region and the freest country in our region, and that has turned into one of the poorest.” Being under socialist rule for decades, she said, has crippled industry, devastated infrastructure, and triggered an exodus of nearly a third of Venezuela’s population. “Our economy has collapsed. It’s been over 80% down in the last [several] years,” she said. “Our people have been forced to flee just to survive.”\n\nThe International Monetary Fund estimated Venezuela’s economy had declined by roughly 75% as of late 2022, also covering its migrant crisis. The left-wing think tank Center for Economic and Policy Research argued shortly afterward that, while this figure was accurate, it discounted the severe economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. on Venezuela for many years.\n\nThe opposition leader described to Brady what she called a “narco-terrorist state” built on repression and corruption, saying that “certainly Venezuela has turned into a safe haven for criminal activities from all over the world.” She accused Maduro and his allies of financing their grip on power through gold smuggling, arms and drug trafficking, and human exploitation.\n\nAt the core of Machado’s plan is a rapid and transparent privatization process. She estimates that more than 500 enterprises were “taken by the regime, confiscated, destroyed, but the infrastructure is there.” She pledged strict oversight and rule of law from “day one,” aiming to lure investors back with stability and fiscal incentives. She pledged open markets and an approach that would be “absolutely strict” in terms of rule of law and transparency, reminding Brady that Venezuela is currently in last place in terms of rule of law. To take one example, the World Justice Project recently ranked Venezuela No. 142, out of 142 countries.",

    "fullText": "On the heels of a high-stakes mission inside Venezuela's capital that captured its indicted leader to bring him to justice, President Donald Trump said his goal now was to get major US oil companies access to its huge reserves — even if it means deploying US troops.\n\n\"We're going to have a presence in Venezuela as it pertains to oil,\" Trump said in a Saturday press conference at Mar-a-Lago in reply to a question about whether the US military would have a presence there. \"So you may need something, not very much.\"\n\nVenezuela has one of the world's largest proven oil reserves, but deploying US troops to guard its oilfields and aging infrastructure comes with high risks and costs, military experts told Business Insider, and will require a stable security environment. This kind of operation may also require congressional authorization or additional funding.\n\n\"When you put US troops into a foreign country, there is going to be some resistance unless they are invited,\" said Peter Mansoor, a retired US Army colonel and professor of military history at the Ohio State University who is an expert in counterinsurgency warfare.\n\nMansoor, who commanded a brigade in Iraq, said US operations there are instructive, showing why sending US troops into Venezuela is the \"least desirable\" option. Iraqis themselves guarded their energy infrastructure, he said, which proved quite vulnerable to attack during the insurgency: Pipelines were bombed, mortars struck an oil refinery, trucks were hijacked only to have the oil sold on black markets.\n\n\"All of those things happened in Iraq, and they could happen here too if the Venezuelans allow an insurgency to erupt,\" said Mansoor, who is also a senior fellow at the Mershon Center for International Security Studies at OSU.\n\nMuch of Venezuela's operations are now managed by the state-run PDVSA oil company that took on assets that had belonged to US companies. Of US oil majors, only Chevron remains.\n\nVenezuela's future production is as murky as its tar-like extra-heavy crude. This type of oil is a large part of its massive oil reserves and requires a crude upgrader process to make it easier to move, an industry analyst said.\n\n\"All of that requires a lot of upfront investment,\" said Ben Cahill, an energy analyst at the University of Texas at Austin. \"So the Venezuelan oil sector presents some particular challenges. The reserves are enormous, and under the right political transition, and if a different investment regime returns, it is an opportunity that will be attractive to some companies.\"\n\nTo be sure, the US military has plenty of experience with energy infrastructure. Soldiers have patrolled near oil fields in eastern Syria. Warships and cutters guarded oil platforms off Iraq during the war and intercepted oil smugglers. A US task force more recently escorted ships, including tankers, threatened by missile and drone attacks in the Red Sea.\n\nAny US military mission in Venezuela turns on a turbulent situation where it's unclear who's in charge; Trump said at the press conference that US officials would be \"running\" Venezuela for a time.\n\n\"What's unclear here is who is actually the opponent,\" said Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. \"Do we think we're going to have to send troops to go in and seize these oil fields rather than simply having the government of Venezuela change its model for managing them? At this point, it's unclear what exactly the protection is from and who would be doing it.\"\n\n\"So jumping ahead to say that the US military is going to now be protecting a bunch of oil facilities is premature,\" Clark said.\n\nOne thing that makes this national discussion so unusual is that it's so nakedly about oil access, unlike the stated justifications for the Persian Gulf war or the 2003 Iraq invasion.\n\n\"The Trump administration has been very open about oil, even though they've tried to position this a little bit in terms of human rights,\" said Paul Poast, an associate professor of political science at the University of Chicago and a resident fellow at the Chicago Council of Global Affairs. \"What remains to be seen is how much planning went into the aftermath — which of course the US has a terrible track record with.\"",

    "fullText": "Hours after a dramatic military operation ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro from power and removed him from the country Saturday, President Donald Trump said the United States would “run” Venezuela at least temporarily and tap its vast oil reserves to sell to other nations.\n\nU.S. operations on Saturday represented America’s most assertive action to achieve regime change in a country since the nation’s 2003 invasion of Iraq. The actions raise stark new questions about the legality of the U.S. moves under a broader campaign against the South American nation.\n\nThe middle-of-the-night seizure of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who were being transported on a U.S. warship to face narco-terrorism conspiracy charges in New York, is beyond even the most high-profile historical examples of aggressive American actions toward autocratic governments in Panama, Iraq and beyond, legal experts said. It came after a surprise U.S. incursion into the Venezuelan capital, rocked with overnight explosions early Saturday.\n\nThe Trump administration described the operation — and earlier deadly strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea — as necessary to stem the flow of dangerous drugs.\n\nProtesters gather in Los Angeles, elsewhere to protest US military action\n\nHundreds gathered in the rain in downtown Los Angeles to protest the U.S. military action in Venezuela.\n\nPeople donning raincoats and holding umbrellas carried signs saying “Stop bombing Venezuela now!” and “No blood for oil” as they listened to speakers. One person held a handwritten sign saying “No War! No Trump!”\n\nA smaller group of about 50 people protested in Las Vegas.\n\nAftermath of US military operation in Venezuela disrupts Caribbean travel\n\nThe U.S. military operation that captured Maduro and flew him out of the country has also disrupted Caribbean travel at a busy travel time for the region.\n\nElisia Cohen had planned to return from her family vacation in Puerto Rico on Friday but a mechanical issue grounded their Delta flight back to Minneapolis. Then, the University of Minnesota professor woke up before dawn Saturday to the news of the strikes on Venezuela and the delay, then cancellations of all flights.\n\n“I hope this will not become a nightmare of airspace not opening up,” she said.\n\nShe spent most of Saturday trying to rebook a flight back to anywhere in the continental United States, and even though she succeeded, she said she won’t truly stop worrying until the airspace reopens and flights start taking off again.\n\nU.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a social media post that “the FAA restricted the airspace in the Caribbean and Venezuela to ensure the SAFETY of the flying public.”\n\n“When appropriate, these airspace restrictions will be lifted,” he said. “Please work with your airlines directly if your flight has been impacted.”\n\n▶ Read more about travel disruptions here\n\nVenezuelans wonder who’s in charge as Trump claims contact with Maduro’s deputy Rodríguez\n\nUncertainty gripped Venezuela on Saturday as people scrambled to understand who was in charge of the South American country.\n\nTrump delivered a shocking pick for who would take control: The United States, perhaps in coordination with one of Maduro’s most trusted aides.\n\nDelcy Rodríguez has served as Maduro’s vice president since 2018, overseeing much of Venezuela’s oil-dependent economy as well as its feared intelligence service. But she is someone the Trump administration apparently is willing to work with, at least for now.\n\n“She’s essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again,” Trump told reporters of Rodríguez, who faced U.S. sanctions during Trump’s first administration for her role in undermining Venezuelan democracy.\n\nTrump indicated that Rodríguez had been sworn in already as president of Venezuela, per the transfer of power outlined in the constitution. However, state television has not broadcast any swearing-in ceremony.\n\nIn her televised address, Rodríguez did not declare herself acting president or mention a political transition. A ticker at the bottom of the screen identified her as the vice president. She gave no sign that she would be cooperating with the U.S.\n\n“What is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,” she said. “History and justice will make the extremists who promoted this armed aggression pay.”\n\n▶ Read more about the reaction within Venezuela\n\nMaduro’s ouster sparks celebrations among Venezuelans in South Florida\n\nRevelers chanted “liberty” and draped Venezuelan flags over their shoulders in South Florida to celebrate Maduro’s capture and removal from the country.\n\nFor some Venezuelan natives, the military action — culminating months of stepped-up U.S. pressure — brought their dreams of reuniting with loved ones closer to reality after years of heartbreaking separations.\n\nPeople gathered for a rally in Doral, the Miami suburb where Trump has a golf resort and where roughly half the population is of Venezuelan descent.\n\nOutside El Arepazo restaurant, a hub of the Venezuelan culture of Doral, one man held a piece of cardboard with “Libertad” scrawled with a black marker. It was a sentiment expressed by others hoping for a new beginning for their home country as they chanted “Liberty! Liberty! Liberty!”\n\n“We’re like everybody — it’s a combination of feelings, of course,” said Alejandra Arrieta, who came to the U.S. in 1997. “There’s fears. There’s excitement. There’s so many years that we’ve been waiting for this. Something had to happen in Venezuela. We all need the freedom.”\n\nBlack lawmakers in Congress condemn ‘illegal’ US actions in Venezuela\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus is blasting Trump over U.S. actions against Maduro, calling the operation “a grave and illegal abuse of power.”\n\n“While Nicolás Maduro is, in fact, an illegitimate leader, the deployment of U.S. military power to impose political change in a sovereign nation — without the consent of Congress or a clear and defined plan of action — threatens to draw the United States into an indefinite conflict in Venezuela,” the caucus said in statement.\n\n“We cannot understate the severity of the consequences that could follow from such reckless actions, which threaten regional stability and weaken our standing on the world stage,” the lawmakers said.\n\nPerson in custody seen gingerly leaving plane believed to be carrying Maduro\n\nAt around 5:25 p.m., a person in custody was escorted out of the plane believed to be carrying Maduro.\n\nThe person gingerly made his way down a stairway one step at a time, then was led across the tarmac surrounded by a crowd of at least three dozen federal agents.\n\nSeveral agents in the crowd appeared to film the person on their phones.\n\nCanadian PM stands by Venezuelan people’s sovereign right to build future\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says his government welcomes the opportunity for freedom, democracy and prosperity for the Venezuelan people.\n\nCarney notes in a post on a social media that Canada has not recognized the “illegitimate regime of Maduro since it stole the 2018 election.” He says Canada has long supported a “Venezuelan-led transition process that respects the democratic will of the Venezuelan people.”\n\nCarney is calling on all parties to respect international law and says Canada stands by the “Venezuelan people’s sovereign right to decide and build their own future.”\n\nSeizing control of Venezuela’s oil presents legal issues for US, law professor says\n\nMatthew Waxman, a Columbia University law professor who was a national security official in the George W. Bush administration, said seizing control of Venezuela’s resources opens up additional legal issues.\n\n“For example, a big issue will be who really owns Venezuela’s oil?” Waxman wrote in an email. “An occupying military power can’t enrich itself by taking another state’s resources, but the Trump administration will probably claim that the Venezuelan government never rightfully held them.”\n\nBut Waxman, who served in the State and Defense departments and on the National Security Council under Bush, noted that “we’ve seen the administration talk very dismissively about international law when it comes to Venezuela.”\n\nJUST IN: Plane carrying deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro arrives in New York following his capture by US, AP source says German leader calls for stability in Venezuela\n\nChancellor Friedrich Merz said in a statement Saturday that Nicolás Maduro led Venezuela to disaster and noted that Germany, like many other countries, didn’t recognize his presidency after the South American nation’s last election.\n\nMerz said that a legal classification of the U.S. intervention is “complex” and “we will take time” on the matter.\n\nHe said that political instability must not arise in Venezuela now and that it’s important to ensure “an orderly transition to a government legitimized by elections.”\n\nSchumer says Trump actions in Venezuela ‘reckless’\n\nThe Senate Democratic leader said, “The idea that Trump plans to now run Venezuela should strike fear in the hearts of all Americans.”\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer of New York said the Trump administration had assured him multiple times it was not pursuing regime change or taking military action in Venezuela.\n\n“Clearly, they are not being straight with Americans,” he said.\n\nRubio hints Cuba could be next after Trump takes Maduro out of Venezuela\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio is hinting that Cuba could be the next target of the Trump administration’s push to restore American dominance in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nRubio said he would be a bit concerned if he were a Cuban government official following the overnight U.S. military operation in Venezuela that captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife. “If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I’d be concerned at least a little bit,” said Rubio, who has had a long preoccupation with both Venezuela and Cuba.\n\nThe U.S. has had a long history of military interventions in Latin America, including its tacit support for the unsuccessful 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion led by Cuban exiles aimed at toppling Fidel Castro.\n\nVenezuela's UN ambassador says his country has right to self defense\n\nIn a letter sent to the U.N. Security Council on Saturday, the Venezuelan ambassador to the U.N. warned that in light of the U.S. strikes, the country “reserves the inherent right to self defense.”\n\nThe letter from Ambassador Samuel Reinaldo Moncada Acosta, obtained by AP, goes on to request an urgent meeting of the 15-member council and condemnation and cessation of U.S. actions.\n\n“What began more than four months ago as a police fantasy is now showing its true face: this is a colonial war aimed at destroying our republican form of government, freely chosen by our people, and at imposing a puppet government that allows the plundering of our natural resources, including the world’s largest oil reserves,” Acosta wrote.\n\nTrump says Venezuelan vice president Delcy Rodríguez sworn in as president\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump claimed that Venezuelan vice president Delcy Rodríguez had been sworn in as president shortly before he spoke to reporters and added she had spoken with Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\n“She is essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again. Very simple,” Trump said.\n\nEarlier, opposition leader María Corina Machado said that the opposition candidate Edmundo González should assume power, saying that he rightfully won the 2024 presidential election.\n\nTrump shares photo of captured Maduro\n\nThe president posted a photo on social media showing Maduro wearing a sweatsuit and a blindfold with the caption: “Nicolas Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima.”\n\nMaduro appeared to be wearing a flotation device around his neck. Next to him was someone wearing a jacket that had a DEA logo.\n\nMaduro also had protective headphones on his ears and appeared to be lifting a water bottle with both arms to drink.\n\nTrump’s action against Maduro contrasts with clemency granted to ex-Honduras leader\n\nTrump’s dramatic action against Maduro is the polar opposite of the clemency he granted to former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández.\n\nTrump in December pardoned Hernández though he was sentenced to 45 years in U.S. prison for helping drug traffickers to safely move hundreds of tons of cocaine north through his country to the U.S.\n\nHernández, who enjoyed support from officials in the first Trump administration, was convicted by a U.S. jury in New York — which Maduro is now set to face.\n\nWhen asked in an interview with Politico about the pardon, Trump said, “I don’t know him” and “I know very little about him,” but added that he was told that Hernández “was set up.”\n\n“The country, uh, deals in drugs, like probably you could say that about every country, and because he was the president, they gave him like 45 years in prison,” he said.\n\nJustice Department released a new indictment of Maduro and wife\n\nThe indictment accuses Maduro of leading a “a corrupt, illegitimate government that, for decades, has leveraged government power to protect and promote illegal activity, including drug trafficking.” It alleges that the drug trafficking efforts “enriched and entrenched Venezuela’s political and military elite.”\n\nU.S. authorities allege that Maduro partnered with “some of the most violent and prolific drug traffickers and narco-terrorists in the world” to bring tons of cocaine into the U.S., according to the indictment.\n\nAuthorities estimate that as much as 250 tons of cocaine were trafficked through Venezuela by 2020, according to the indictment. The drugs were moved on go-fast vessels, fishing boats and container ships or via planes from clandestine airstrips, authorities allege.\n\nUN is ‘deeply alarmed’ by the US strike\n\nThe United Nations said it was “deeply alarmed” by the U.S. strikes and reported detention of President Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela. It expressed concern that the escalation was a violation of international law.\n\n“These developments constitute a dangerous precedent,” Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, said in a statement. Dujarric said the U.N. worried about the larger implications for Latin America and the Caribbean and called on “all actors in Venezuela” to respect human rights and the rule of law.\n\nChina slams US strike in Venezuela\n\nChina strongly condemned the U.S. strike in Venezuela and the action against its president, the Foreign Ministry said, adding the Beijing government was “deeply shocked” and firmly opposed to the operation.\n\n“Such hegemonic acts of the U.S. seriously violate international law and Venezuela’s sovereignty and threaten peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean region,” it said.\n\nIt called on the U.S. to comply with international law and the principles of the U.N. Charter, urging it to stop violating the sovereignty and security of other nations.\n\nTrump says a helicopter was hit and ‘a few’ US members were injured in Venezuela\n\nTrump said a helicopter was hit during the operation in Venezuela and a few U.S. members were injured, but he believed none were killed.\n\n“A couple of guys were hit, but they came back and they’re supposed to be in pretty good shape,” he said.\n\nHe said the U.S. lost no aircraft in the operation.\n\n“We got it all back. One of them was hit pretty hard but—a helicopter—but we got it back.\n\n“We had to do it because it’s a war,” he added a few moments later.\n\nTrump dismisses criticism he did not seek congressional permission for Venezuela strike\n\nTrump brushed off criticism from U.S. Democratic lawmakers that he did not seek permission from Congress ahead of time and that the strike was illegal. He called his Democratic critics “weak, stupid people” and blaming his political opponents for inflation in the U.S.\n\nHe said the operation in Venezuela was “really genius.”\n\n“All they do is complain,” he said of the Democrats.\n\n“They should say, ‘Great job.’ They shouldn’t say, ‘Oh Gee, maybe it’s not constitutional.’ You know, the same old stuff that we’ve been hearing for years and years and years,” Trump said.\n\nTrump says he proposed to the Mexican president that US take out cartels\n\nTrump said the operation in Venezuela “wasn’t meant to be” a message to Mexico, but then he has proposed to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum that the U.S. “take out” cartels in her country and suggested the U.S. might take action.\n\n“We’re very friendly with her, she’s a good woman. But the cartels are running Mexico. She’s not running Mexico. The cartels are running Mexico,” Trump said.\n\nHe said he’s asked Sheinbaum numerous times, “Would you like us to take out the cartels?” but she has said no.\n\n“Something’s going to have to be done with Mexico,” Trump said.\n\nTrump says US will decide on what’s next for Venezuela\n\nPresident Donald Trump said in an interview Saturday morning that the United States will be making decisions on what is next for Venezuela after capturing the Latin American country’s president and flying him out of the country.\n\n“We’ll be involved in it very much” as to who will govern the country, Trump said.\n\n“We can’t take a chance in letting somebody else run and just take over what he left, or left off,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News hours after the capture.\n\nMaduro was at his home when he was seized in US operation, party leader tells AP\n\nVenezuelan ruling party leader Nahum Fernández told The Associated Press that Nicolás Maduro and his wife were at their home within the Ft. Tiuna military installation when they were captured.\n\n“That’s where they bombed,” he said. “And, there, they carried out what we could call a kidnapping of the president and the first lady of the country.”\n\nEuropean leaders react to Maduro’s capture by the US\n\n— EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas wrote on X that she had spoken with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the EU ambassador in Caracas. “The EU has repeatedly stated that Mr Maduro lacks legitimacy and has defended a peaceful transition. Under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN Charter must be respected. We call for restraint.”\n\n— Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called for “de-escalation and responsibility. International Law and the principles of the United Nations Charter must be respected,” Sánchez wrote on X.\n\n— Russia’s Foreign Ministry said it is “extremely alarmed” and called for “immediate clarification,” according to a statement posted Saturday on the ministry’s Telegram channel. The ministry said such actions, if confirmed, would constitute “an unacceptable infringement on the sovereignty of an independent state.”\n\n— British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the U.K. was not involved in the U.S. operation in Venezuela and that he would seek more information from Trump. Without condemning the U.S. action, Starmer said he always believes that international law should be upheld. “But I think at this stage, fast moving situation, let’s establish the facts and take it from there,” he said.\n\nUS indicted Maduro on narcoterrorism charges in 2020\n\nThe Justice Department during Trump’s first term in office charged in the several indictments that Maduro had effectively converted Venezuela into a criminal enterprise at the service of drug traffickers and terrorist groups as he and his allies stole billions from the South American country.\n\nThe coordinated unsealing of indictments against 14 officials and government-connected individuals, and rewards of $55 million for Maduro and four others, attacked all the key planks of what then-Attorney General William Barr called the “corrupt Venezuelan regime,” including the Maduro-dominated judiciary and the powerful armed forces.\n\nOne indictment by prosecutors in New York accused Maduro and socialist party boss Diosdado Cabello, head of the rubber-stamping constitutional assembly, of conspiring with Colombian rebels and members of the military “to flood the United States with cocaine” and use the drug trade as a “weapon against America.”\n\nRead our news report from 2020 on the charges\n\nRussia calls US action ‘an act of armed aggression’\n\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry condemned what it called a U.S. “act of armed aggression” against Venezuela in a statement posted on its Telegram channel Saturday.\n\n“Venezuela must be guaranteed the right to determine its own destiny without any destructive, let alone military, outside intervention,” the statement said.\n\nThe ministry called for dialogue to prevent further escalation and said it reaffirmed its “solidarity” with the Venezuelan people and government, adding that Russia supports calls for an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting.",

    "description": "In the aftermath of the attack on Venezuela, the president said the US would be running the country and bringing in American oil companies.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump revealed key details of the US military assault on Venezuela during a press conference on Saturday.\n\nFrom Mar-a-Lago in Florida, Trump addressed the operation, including the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who have been indicted by a US federal court.\n\nHere's what Trump said about the mission, the capture of the Venezuelan leader, and what comes next.\n\nTrump called the operation against Venezuelan leadership, which occurred overnight and into the early morning, \"an extraordinary military operation\" involving the use of assets and weapons across air, land, and sea domains. Other officials revealed that intelligence, space, and cyber assets were involved as well.\n\nDuring the press conference, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said the apprehension mission, called Absolute Resolve, involved over 150 aircraft, including fighter jets, bombers, electronic warfare planes, intelligence and surveillance aircraft, helicopters, and drones.\n\nSome assets disabled Venezuelan defenses and provided cover, while others were involved in infiltration and extraction.\n\nThe US president said that the assault targeted \"a heavily fortified military fortress in the heart of Caracas,\" where Maduro was captured during the night. He added that the US used \"certain expertise\" to turn off the lights in Caracas and that the Venezuelan military was overwhelmed by US forces.\n\nAmong the most important discussion points of the president's press conference is that the US will run Venezuela \"until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition.\"\n\nExactly how the Trump administration plans to do this, and for how long, remains unknown. By law, Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, should assume power. Trump added that Rodríguez \"really doesn't have a choice\" but to accept US involvement.\n\nWhen speaking on who would be in charge of this plan, Trump pointed to the officials standing behind him at the conference, including Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security advisor, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Caine.\n\nAdditionally, Trump said, the biggest US oil companies will be going to Venezuela to \"spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country.\"\n\nVenezuela is home to the world's largest proven crude oil reserves. The US has been seizing and blockading oil tankers in recent months as part of the escalating tension between Maduro and the Trump administration. Trump has said the US built Venezuela's oil industry and intends to take it back, accusing Caracas of using the money to fund narco-terrorism and other criminal activities.\n\nDuring the conference, Trump said the US was ready to conduct a second attack, \"a much bigger wave,\" on Venezuela if needed.\n\n\"We actually assumed that a second wave would be necessary, but now it's probably not,\" the president said, pointing to the success of the first attack.",

This increased production could push already-depressed crude oil prices even lower.\n\nAs shown in the chart below, crude oil has fallen sharply since the start of last year.\n\nAny US companies that start drilling in Venezuela will face a catch-22: The more oil they add to the world's existing surplus, the further prices will fall, and the less profit they'll reap for their drilling efforts.\n\nHow they decide to proceed will ultimately shape the price of oil — and what normal consumers pay to live their lives.",

Known informally as \"El Pollo,\" Carvajal Barrios was a high-ranking member of the Maduro government before he broke ranks in 2019. He went into hiding in Spain and was captured (twice) before being extradited to the United States, where he pleaded guilty last June to a range of drug-related charges.\n\nEl Pollo is mentioned seven times in the new indictment, suggesting he could be key to the government's case against Maduro.\n\nVenezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has released a public statement, saying the opposition is \"prepared to enforce our mandate and take power.\"\n\n\"Nicolás Maduro, as of today, is facing international justice for the atrocious crimes committed against Venezuelans and against citizens of many other nations,\" the statement reads.\n\nVenezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has released a public statement, saying the opposition is \"prepared to enforce our mandate and take power.\"\n\n\"Nicolás Maduro, as of today, is facing international justice for the atrocious crimes committed against Venezuelans and against citizens of many other nations,\" the statement reads.\n\n\"In light of his refusal to accept a negotiated exit, the government of the United States has fulfilled its promise to uphold the rule of law.\"\n\nTrump is scheduled to speak from Mar-a-Lago about the Venezuela raid that captured Maduro. You can watch on the White House livestream below.\n\nTrump said US forces stormed a \"fortress\" to capture Maduro, who had tried to reach a \"safety space\" surrounded by steel.\n\nSpeaking to Fox, Trump said \"a couple of guys\" and a US helicopter took fire during the operation, but he believes that no one was killed.\n\nThe president described the raid as being \"very organized,\" involving \"highly trained soldiers.\" He said the raid was planned with \"pinpoint\" accuracy, and revealed that the US built a model house identical to the one that was raided — a tactic similar to what the US did ahead of the 2011 raid on Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan.\n\nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi on Saturday posted the new Maduro indictment on X. The one she shared is an expanded version of the 2020 indictment, accusing Maduro of a widespread conspiracy to traffic drugs into the United States.\n\nIt names some new defendants, however — notably Maduro's wife Cilia Adela Flores de Maduro and son Nicolás Ernesto Maduro Guerra.\n\nManhattan federal prosecutors indicted Muduro and other members of his government in 2020, during the first Trump administration.\n\nThat indictment carried many of the same charges cited by US Attorney General Pam Bondi on Saturday as the basis for Saturday's arrest.\n\nManhattan federal prosecutors indicted Muduro and other members of his government in 2020, during the first Trump administration.\n\nThat indictment carried many of the same charges cited by US Attorney General Pam Bondi on Saturday as the basis for Saturday's arrest.\n\nThe 2020 case, which remains active, alleges narco-terrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to import cocaine, and possession and use of machine guns and destructive devices. It does not, however, mention Maduro's wife, Cilia Flores, suggesting that the latest charges could be brought in a refiled or expanded indictment.",
