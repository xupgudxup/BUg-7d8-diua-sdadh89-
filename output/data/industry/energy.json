    "fullText": "LONDON/WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. control of Venezuela's oil exports has ensnared barrels that had been servicing debt to China, lining up another potential showdown between the two superpowers that could further complicate the South American country's path out of default.\n\nAround a tenth of Venezuela's $150 billion foreign debt pile is estimated to be loans from China that ​the OPEC member was paying in oil cargoes - until the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month.\n\nDebt experts said the ramifications of China's claim on the cargoes and any clash with ‌the United States could make it tougher for Venezuela to restructure its debt after a 2017 default and put at risk Beijing's cooperation in restructuring deals for other developing nations.\n\n\"Even under the best circumstances, this was going to be very messy - trying to disentangle where all ‌these creditors stand in the credit hierarchy,\" said Christopher Hodge, chief economist with Natixis and a former U.S. Treasury official.\n\n\"The fact that now America is controlling all the finances into and out of the country...this seems to be unprecedented to me, that we're going to have such entanglements, such opacity about the finances of a government,\" Hodge said.\n\nWhile Washington currently controls only oil sale proceeds, Hodge noted that these are Venezuela's main source of revenue.\n\nDocuments and sources from state-run oil firm PDVSA show three supertankers have been shuttling between Venezuela and China over the last five years carrying oil for interest payments under the terms of a temporary deal struck in 2019. But these shipments are only ⁠a fraction of Venezuela's total crude exports to China.\n\nAidData, a research lab at ‌the U.S. university William & Mary that tracks lending, said some cash proceeds from oil sent to China went into an account controlled by Beijing and on to service the debt - even as sanctions and default blocked payments to many of Venezuela's other creditors.\n\nThe Trump administration has now said that proceeds from the sale of Venezuela's oil will go into ‍a Qatar-based account controlled by Washington, potentially giving the U.S. President himself substantial leverage over which creditors get paid, and when.\n\nIn response to a request for comment on the cargoes and debt payments, China's foreign ministry said Beijing \"has repeatedly stated its position\".\n\nBeijing condemned the redirection of Venezuelan oil exports during a January 7 news conference, adding \"legitimate rights and interests of China and other countries in Venezuela must be protected\".\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Reuters that Trump had brokered an oil deal with Venezuela ​that \"will benefit the American and Venezuelan people\".\n\nThe Trump administration is allowing China to purchase Venezuelan oil but not at the \"unfair, undercut\" prices at which Caracas sold the crude previously, a U.S. official said on Thursday.\n\nTraders managing Venezuelan oil ‌sales have offered some to Chinese refiners, but these are private market transactions, not intended as debt payments.\n\n\"The people of Venezuela will collect a fair price for their oil from China and other nations,\" the U.S. official said.\n\nThe Venezuelan communications ministry, which handles all press inquiries for the government, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nTrump could yet make a deal with China. However, the planned U.S. takeover of Venezuela's oil sector and control of its revenue could upend the hierarchy of creditors, restructuring advisors warn.\n\n\"All of these things will have the practical effect of subordinating the claims of legacy debtholders,\" said global sovereign debt expert Lee Buchheit, adding it was unclear if Trump had the legal right to determine who gets paid first.\n\nSome $60 billion of Venezuela's bonds tipped into default in 2017, and a restructuring agreement is essential to enable it to borrow again and attract new ⁠investment.\n\nIn a typical restructuring, bilateral lenders come together and agree what losses they will accept, usually via the Paris Club of ​creditor nations. This sets the bar for the \"comparable\" losses private lenders - bond investors, banks and others - must take.\n\n\"Comparability of treatment will be ​a real challenge, particularly if the U.S. controls the use of oil revenues,\" said Mark Walker, a longtime sovereign debt advisor who previously worked on potential Venezuelan restructurings.\n\nIf the U.S. pushes China to swallow significant writedowns on its debt - and China digs its heels in - it could slow a restructuring and hinder Venezuela's economic recovery in the process.\n\nThat could ‍keep Venezuela \"in very dire straits during the foreseeable future\", said ⁠Jean-Charles Sambor, head of emerging market debt with TT International, which holds Venezuelan bonds. In turn, this would limit how much the country can afford to repay to bondholders and other creditors.\n\nChina has little immediate leverage. Countries typically do not take other nations to court or arbitration over lending claims, Walker said, and would need to settle the situation \"on a government-to-government basis\".\n\nBut ramifications are possible: China is the ⁠largest bilateral lender to the developing world and its cooperation with the Paris Club has been crucial over the past decade. Beijing agreed restructuring terms via a platform called the Common Framework during Ghana, Zambia and Ethiopia's debt restructuring talks.\n\n\"China's obvious leverage is to refuse ‌to cooperate in future Common Framework sovereign debt workouts until it feels that it has been treated fairly in Venezuela,\" Buchheit said. \"And that threat would have some force.\"",

    "fullText": "Shannon Gerdauskas thought she was going in for a routine oil change. Instead, the DeLand, Florida resident was left with a repair bill of nearly $20,000.\n\nGerdauskas took her Mercedes to a Take 5 Oil Change location in October, expecting to be in and out quickly. Instead, she says a technician mistakenly drained her transmission fluid rather than her engine oil and let her drive away.\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nI’m approaching retirement with no savings. Should I panic? Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nThe trouble started within minutes.\n\n“It was shifting by itself. So, it was like trying to go into reverse and neutral as I’m driving down the road,” she told WFTV’s Action 9 Consumer Investigator (1).\n\nGerdauskas immediately took the car back to the shop, where workers acknowledged the error.\n\nBut what followed was a familiar and often pricey consumer dispute: Who’s responsible when routine maintenance goes wrong?\n\nAccording to Gerdauskas, her dealership later determined the vehicle had been driven with no transmission fluid, which can cause serious internal damage to the car. The estimated cost to replace the transmission and complete all the related work totaled more than $18,000.\n\nTake 5 told Action 9 that it paid for a transmission flush but closed the claim after the dealership said the transmission did not need to be replaced.\n\nMeanwhile, Gerdauskas said she was told the transmission would eventually fail.\n\n“My transmission was not damaged before it entered their shop,” she said, “Just pay for the damage you did.”\n\nIn a statement, the company said that while cases like Gerdauskas’ are rare, they “strive to resolve matters fairly and transparently”. But her case isn’t as unique as it seems.\n\nAction 9 found similar complaints nationwide involving Take 5.\n\nWFTV’s sister station in Charlotte, North Carolina, spoke with Ben Brown in 2025 after a visit to Take 5. He said he pulled over, opened the oil reservoir and smoke was coming out. His car ultimately needed a new engine.\n\nIn Georgia, Robin Porterfield reported a similar experience. She said technicians drained her oil but never refilled it before sending her on her way.",

Many residents' apartments were already freezing cold from disruption to the ‌city's centralised heat distribution system following previous attacks.\n\nMoscow carried out the strikes as trilateral, U.S.-brokered talks between Russia and Ukraine continued into a second day in the UAE, with no sign of compromise on Friday.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said one person was killed in the capital city and four injured, including three being treated ⁠in hospital, while 19 people including ‌a child were wounded in Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv.\n\nRussia, which has pummelled Ukraine's power grid since its full-scale invasion in 2022, is conducting its heaviest bombardment campaign ‍on energy facilities this winter, leaving people across Ukraine with only a few hours of power a day and some without heat or water.\n\nOver 800,000 people in the capital and another 400,000 in the northern region of Chernihiv ​were without power after the latest attacks, Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said.\n\nUkraine's air force said ‌Russia had unleashed 375 drones and 21 missiles, including two of its rarely deployed Tsirkon ballistic missiles, in its overnight attack.\n\nThe sky over Kyiv was lit up by regular orange flashes as air defences fired on missiles and drones descending on the capital, with loud booms echoing around the city's tall buildings.\n\nTymur Tkachenko, head of Kyiv's military administration, reported strikes in at least four districts.

    "fullText": "MOSCOW, Jan 23 (Reuters) - China is set to ramp up imports of Russian oil in January, absorbing barrels that would have previously gone to India ​and Turkey, as tougher Western sanctions force Moscow to redirect flows, LSEG data ‌and traders said.\n\nThe United States and the European Union imposed sweeping sanctions in late 2025 targeting Russian oil ‌sellers and shippers, including energy giants Rosneft and Lukoil, complicating purchases for global buyers and tightening scrutiny on Russian crude exports.\n\nChina is poised to receive nearly 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of Russian oil by sea this month, compared with 1.1 million bpd in December, according to ⁠preliminary LSEG data. Beijing, already ‌a key consumer of Russian Far East ESPO Blend, also boosted imports of Russian Urals oil to a record high of 405,000 bpd ‍in January, the highest since mid-2023, data provided by energy consultancy Kpler showed.\n\nIndia, previously the largest buyer of Russian Urals by sea since the EU embargo on Moscow's oil in 2022, slashed purchases ​to below 1 million bpd in December, down from an average of 1.3 million ‌bpd last year, LSEG data showed. Indian refiners are expected to keep Russian oil imports near 1 million bpd in January as they diversify supply sources.\n\nTurkey, also a major Russian oil buyer, reduced Urals imports in January to about 250,000 bpd, compared to an average of 275,000 bpd in 2025 and well below the record 400,000 bpd reached in June ⁠last year.\n\n\"As Indian and Turkish buyers cut purchases ​recently, some Russian Urals cargoes headed for China,\" said ​a trader involved in Russian oil sales. He added that the surplus of Urals barrels weighed on prices.\n\nDiscounts for Urals crude delivered to China ‍in late 2025 widened ⁠to as much as $12 per barrel below ICE Brent for some cargoes, while current Urals differentials hover near minus $10 to the benchmark, according to two traders active ⁠in the Asian market.\n\nDemand for Urals in India and Turkey, both major exporters of diesel to Europe, slumped ‌due to the EU ban on fuels produced from Russian-origin crude, the ‌traders added.",

    "description": "Despite geopolitical upheaval, sanctions, and military action, this South American state's proven oil reserves remain colossal.",
    "fullText": "When it comes to oil-rich countries, one would usually think of Middle Eastern nations like Saudi Arabia or Iraq. But what many do not know is that the country with the largest oil reserves in the world lies just 1,200 miles to the south of Florida — or about a three-and-a-half-hour flight across the Caribbean. This is the state of Venezuela, and the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that its oil reserves are at more than 303 billion barrels, as of 2025.\n\nMost of Venezuela's oil is in the Orinoco Belt, a swathe of land north of the Orinoco River, but extracting it poses an unusual set of challenges. The country's oil infrastructure needs to be overhauled due to years of mismanagement and corruption and a history of asset seizures from private companies by the state. The country is also under U.S. sanctions, which limit its ability to sell oil overseas.\n\nVenezuela's crude oil isn't easy to process, either. Saudi Arabian and American oil fields produce light, sweet crude oil, which contains very little sulfur, and isn't corrosive to pipes and equipment. On the other hand, Venezuelan oil is much harder to process because it's mostly heavy and sour, making it harder to process crude oil into unleaded gasoline. Prof. Paasha Mahdavi of the University of California, Santa Barbara, told NPR that it's \"among the dirtiest oils in the world to produce when it comes to global warming.\"\n\nAside from Venezuela, other countries that have massive reserves include Saudi Arabia (267 billion barrels), Iran (208 billion barrels), Iraq (145 billion barrels), and the United Arab Emirates (113 billion barrels). The United States sits in the top eight, with an estimated 45 billion barrels of crude oil in reserve.\n\nOne thing that allowed the U.S. to massively increase its oil reserves and become one of the top 10 countries with the largest oil reserves is the development of fracking. Unlike traditional oil extraction techniques, which siphoned oil deposits from porous material, fracking pumps a special type of fluid deep underground to break the dense rock that holds the oil and make it easier to extract.\n\nOther nations are continually exploring to find new oil fields within their borders, and the U.S. made a new discovery in Texas in January 2026, which potentially has 1.6 billion barrels of oil. So, if there's a new substantial find or new technologies are developed to efficiently extract more oil from existing wells, then it's possible that another state can overtake Venezuela as the largest oil reserve holder in the world.",

    "fullText": "In cities across Australia, fleets of nice-looking electric buses quietly ferry thousands of commuters each day. But new warnings from cybersecurity experts have transformed what once looked like a clean energy success story into a geopolitical flashpoint.\n\nOfficials in Australia and the United Kingdom now say some Chinese-made buses may contain code that theoretically lets the buses’ manufacturer shut them down remotely via a so-called “kill switch.”\n\nThe revelation has renewed global fears about foreign-controlled technology embedded in critical infrastructure.\n\nThe spotlight is on the Yutong-made battery-electric buses. It’s a major Chinese manufacturer whose vehicles have been widely purchased in Australia’s capital, Canberra, and other jurisdictions.\n\nBritish reports, citing tests by the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre and Transport for the UK government, found that similar models in Europe could be accessed remotely by the manufacturer’s systems, including diagnostics and software updates, and that, theoretically, such access could be used to stop a bus’s drive system.\n\nThis marks a dramatic escalation in cyber-risk warnings tied that aren’t about phone networks or internet routers but about public transit vehicles. Transport Canberra reportedly responded by launching a fresh investigation into cybersecurity risks linked to the buses, following the British analysis and earlier flags from Norwegian transit authorities who found what they termed a functional remote shutdown capability during tests.\n\nTo cyber researchers, the worry is not that a Chinese government operator is now flipping switches in real time, since there aren’t any confirmed cases of foreign actors actively disabling buses. The concern is that the vulnerability exists at all in imported vehicles that operate on public streets and, in some cases, carry government employees and personnel.\n\n“This isn’t just about buses,” Australian cybersecurity expert Alastair MacGibbon told local media. “It goes to how much control is embedded in the technology we import, and whether those controls could be abused.”\n\nThis episode in neighboring Australia (ally, we mean) reads like vindication for policymakers in the US who have long sounded the alarm over dependencies on Chinese technology.\n\nTransport Secretary Sean Duffy and other hardliners have repeatedly asserted that Chinese-linked vehicles and connected technologies pose unacceptable security risks — even going so far as to say China should never sell cars (or similarly connected vehicles) on American roads “as long as I have breath in my body.”\n\nWhile those comments were dismissed as bluster by critics, the Australian “kill-switch” story has suddenly given them a concrete, globally reported incident to point to.\n\nIn Washington, the Biden administration tightened restrictions on connected vehicles containing Chinese software or hardware, with new rules designed to ban such imports by model year 2027 — a response to precisely the kinds of national security vulnerabilities highlighted by the Australian case.\n\nOpponents of these policies argue that connectivity features, including remote diagnostics and over-the-air updates, are standard across the global auto and transit industries, not unique to Chinese manufacturers.\n\nIndeed, any modern vehicle with internet connectivity might in theory be accessed remotely, whether made in Beijing, Detroit, or Tokyo. Critics in China have taken to global media to warn that U.S. bans could backfire by raising costs and supply chain challenges for American automakers dependent on global components.\n\nBut for many U.S. national security experts, the defining issue isn’t simply connectivity but control. If a foreign company can access the mission-critical systems of vehicles running on public streets — or the energy grids, solar inverters, or AI systems that undergird modern life — then that access becomes a lever that adversaries could exploit during crises.\n\nThe Australian episode has already spurred official reviews of every Yutong model in service. Transport Canberra officials insist there is no immediate operational concern based on current investigations, and that local buses are updated via physical service centers rather than remote connectivity.\n\nBut the warning’s broader resonance has rippled through capitals from London to Canberra, Oslo to Washington: as nations electrify their transit fleets and embrace connected vehicles, they must also reckon with who controls that connectedness.\n\nAnd for American lawmakers who warned loudly (and, in the eyes of some, prematurely) that Chinese technology on wheels isn’t just another import, this moment may well feel like a long-anticipated reckoning.",

    "description": "Morgan Stanley identifies AI adoption, energy trends, societal shifts, and deglobalization as key market drivers in 2026.",
    "fullText": "There are four major themes that will drive markets in 2026, Morgan Stanley says: A multipolar world, technology diffusion, societal shifts, and the future of energy.\n\nLet's get into each, starting with the concept of a multipolar world. For Morgan Stanley, the world is becoming less globalized as governments become more protectionist.\n\n\"It's clear that policymakers globally are implementing policies that will speed up the devolution of the globalization that marked much of the post-Cold War period,\" said Stephen C Byrd, an equity strategist at the bank, in a client note on Thursday. \"Said more simply, policymakers are keen to promote their visions of national and economic security through less open commerce and more local control of supply chains and key technologies.\"\n\nSecond, the bank thinks AI will begin to be adopted more broadly by businesses, helping them boost profits. Stocks will be judged on whether their businesses are incorporating AI enough, MS said.\n\nThird, energy demand has turned a corner thanks to the AI infrastructure buildout. While demand for energy has fallen over the last couple of decades, it's now surging to all-time highs.\n\n\"We expect total US energy consumption to rise 10% over the next decade, reversing decades of declines; by 2030, it should eclipse the prior peak, set in 2007,\" Byrd wrote.\n\nFinally, societal shifts are happening in things like work (thanks to AI), and aging and longevity.\n\n\"We see multiple trends driving broad societal impacts around the world, with effects felt across a surprisingly wide range of industries,\" Byrd wrote. \"The ripple effects of AI-driven employment disruption/evolution, an aging population, changing consumer preferences, the drive for healthy longevity, and challenging demographics across many geographies will continue to matter for governments, economies, and corporates.\"\n\nAs a way to play these trends, the bank highlighted 14 US stocks that its analysts have an \"overweight\" rating on.

    "description": "An oil shock, disruptions from China, and NATO conflicts are among BCA's list of unlikely but plausible events that would slam markets in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Oil prices soaring, the world economy falling into a recession, and the NATO alliance dissolving top the list of one research firm's possible black swan events in 2026.\n\nAnalysts at BCA Research listed five unlikely but plausible scenarios that could derail markets in 2026. In a note to clients, the firm said its annual list of potential black swans was slightly different this year and addressed only \"the most important\" risks, given that there are several black swan threats investors are discussing \"ad nauseam.\"\n\n\"It is a sign of the times that white swans are now in the minority,\" a team led by Matt Gertken, the chief geopolitical and US political strategist at the firm, wrote.\n\nHere's what the firm thinks are the five biggest outlier threats facing markets this year:\n\nOil prices could spiral if the Iranian government collapses. It is a possible event that would jeopardize a significant portion of the world's oil supply, and the inflationary impact of that shock could send the world economy into a recession, the firm speculated.\n\nBCA pointed to recent geopolitical tensions surrounding Iran and estimated there is a roughly 38% chance of a \"massive\" oil supply shock stemming from upheavals in the country. The estimated probability of a \"minor\" oil supply shock is 40%.\n\nA geopolitical shock in the Middle East usually causes crude prices to rise 3% over a month and 10% over three months, according to a historical analysis from BCA.\n\n\"But a real Iran shock would be much bigger than average,\" the firm wrote.\n\nThe strategists acknowledged that President Donald Trump is seeking to avoid an oil supply shock amid pressure from the coming midterm elections. Iran is also incentivized to \"leave oil alone\" in order to avoid attacks from other nations, which should prevent a shock, they said.\n\nThe world's inventory of oil also remains \"substantial\" at around 8 billion barrels, according to estimates from BCA's commodities and energy team.\n\nThe stock market could be in for another bout of turmoil similar to last year's stunning reveal of China's lower-cost AI model if the country pulls ahead of the US in the tech arms race.\n\nChina already spends more on research and development compared to the European Union. Patent applications in the nation also outpace applications in the US, Europe, South Korea, and Japan, BCA said, citing data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\nA technological breakthrough in Beijing could hit stock prices elsewhere around the world, BCA said. The firm pointed to the DeepSeek-fueled sell-off that erased $1 trillion $1 trillion from US stocks last year.\n\n\"This episode could happen again,\" BCA wrote.\n\nShould China make more progress on the AI front, OpenAI, ChatGPT's parent, could see its valuation \"evaporate,\" the firm said.\n\nStrategists later added that they saw a 50% chance of the tech bubble bursting this year.\n\nChina could become economically self-sufficient, removing a key constraint that prevents the country from escalating military conflict related to Taiwan, BCA suggested.\n\nThe firm estimated there is a 39% probability that tensions between China and Taiwan would escalate this year. They also saw a 25% probability that tensions could break out in a proxy war, and a 7% probability that tensions could break out into a major war.\n\n\"What if China reaches technological self-sufficiency so that it can pursue a maximalist policy abroad?\" strategists wrote. \"If China falls deeper into demographic decline, debt-deflation, and dictatorship, then its powers have already peaked and its best chance for creating a sphere of influence is now.\"\n\nChina's economic statistics, like its industrial production, suggest that the nation is not preparing for war at the moment, the firm noted.\n\n\"It is not flashing red, at least not yet,\" the firm said of risk factors that could lead to military conflict.\n\nRussia could seize territory from a NATO member, sparking military conflict between Russia and the alliance. In the worst-case scenario, Russia could make nuclear threats against NATO, and the US may need to step in to \"restore the 'balance of terror,'\" strategists speculated.\n\nThe firm estimated there is a 10% probability of a Russia-NATO war.\n\n\"Russia is currently engaged in a campaign to sabotage Europe's critical infrastructure. The US's lack of solidarity with the allies could encourage overreach. Russia could take its provocations too far,\" the BCA wrote.\n\nWhile the firm said it expects Russia to reach a ceasefire with Ukraine this year, it also pointed to the risk that Trump could provide Ukraine with new military support and funding, which could lead Moscow to become more aggressive in its war with Kyiv.\n\n\"Russia, endangered by the new demands of a longer war against a superior opponent, and having missed the chance to negotiate a favorable ceasefire, could become desperate and even more dangerous,\" the firm added.\n\nShould Russia attack another NATO nation and the US doesn't come to their defense, the alliance would become a \"dead letter,\" BCA said.\n\nAlternatively, the US could also invade Greenland and cause the alliance to dissolve, the firm said, though Trump ruled out using military force to acquire the territory.\n\nBCA said it doubted either scenario would occur, but pegged a 30% probability that the US could harm NATO in some way.\n\n\"The president is determined to seize Greenland at any cost, and to insist on the full extent of his constitutional power as executive and commander-in-chief, then obviously he could conquer Greenland, to hell with the consequences,\" strategists wrote.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is allowing China to purchase Venezuelan oil but not at \"unfair, undercut\" prices at which ​Caracas sold the crude before the U.S. removed President Nicolas Maduro, a ‌U.S. official said on Thursday.\n\nWhile the oil will be sold in the global marketplace, the administration has required ‌that the majority be sold to the United States, the administration official said on condition of anonymity. The U.S. says it will control Venezuela's oil sales indefinitely after seizing Maduro on January 3.\n\n\"Thanks to President (Donald) Trump’s decisive and successful law enforcement operation, ⁠the people of Venezuela will ‌collect a fair price for their oil from China and other nations rather than a corrupt, cheap price,\" the official said.\n\nChina ‍has been Venezuela's top oil buyer for years, and the sales helped Caracas repay massive loans to Beijing in debt-for-oil deals.\n\nThe administration is allowing China to buy the oil at \"fair ​market prices - not the unfair, undercut prices\" at which Maduro sold oil to ‌China to pay debts, the official said.\n\nU.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said last week that the U.S. was receiving about $45 per barrel for Venezuelan oil compared with the roughly $31 Venezuela was getting before Maduro's capture.\n\nTrading houses Trafigura and Vitol have sold some 11 million barrels of oil in an initial supply deal between Venezuela and ⁠the U.S. of stranded crude, representing about a ​quarter of the $2 billion agreement.\n\nTrafigura completed its first ​crude sale to a customer in a deal with Spanish company Repsol while Vitol has negotiated cargoes to U.S. refiners including Valero ‍and Phillips 66 and ⁠to its refinery in Italy, sources said.\n\nChina's oil imports from Venezuela are expected to slump starting in February as fewer tankers have managed to leave ⁠after the U.S. claimed control of the OPEC producer's sales, traders and analysts said last week.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Timothy Gardnerin Washington; Additional reporting by Nidhi Verma in New ‌Delhi; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Andrea Ricci )",

    "fullText": "PONCE, Puerto Rico/HOUSTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Two oil tankers seized this month by the U.S. in its campaign against Venezuela were near Puerto Rico on Wednesday, a Reuters witness and Tankertrackers.com ​data said, the first sightings almost since their capture and a possible hint at their destination.\n\nThe ships are supertanker ‌M Sophia, seized by the U.S. on January 7 carrying Venezuelan oil, and the smaller tanker Galileo, formerly called Veronica and taken last week empty, although ‌it has previously carried Venezuelan oil.\n\nThe M Sophia and Galileo are among seven vessels linked to Venezuelan oil exports captured by the U.S. military and Coast Guard in recent weeks, mostly in the Caribbean Sea.\n\nU.S. officials have not disclosed destinations or plans for the seized vessels. The U.S. Coast Guard declined to comment, directing inquiries to the White House. The White House did not immediately respond to a ⁠request for a comment.\n\nBecause the vessels' geolocating ‌beacons have not been turned on, the locations of M Sophia and Galileo were unknown until the Tankertrackers.com and witness confirmation on Wednesday.\n\nThe vessels could remain in Puerto Rico or be moved to another ‍U.S. port. The other five captured tankers are near the U.S. Gulf Coast, in Venezuelan waters and near Scotland, shipping data showed.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has said the U.S. intervention — including the capture of President Nicolás Maduro on January 3 — is aimed at stopping drug trafficking.\n\nWashington intends to ​direct Venezuela’s government and revive the country’s crippled oil sector by bringing major U.S. oil companies in to rebuild it.\n\nTrump ‌has imposed a blockade to prevent sanctioned tankers from shipping Venezuelan oil, which in December brought exports close to a standstill. Shipments have accelerated in January under U.S. supervision, but millions of barrels remain in onshore and floating storage.\n\nThe U.S. government has filed for court warrants to seize dozens more tankers linked to the Venezuelan oil trade, sources told Reuters last week. This week, vessel Sagitta was intercepted.\n\nAlong with most tankers under Western sanctions or part of the so-called shadow fleet, many of the Venezuela-linked tankers were ⁠built over 20 years ago and pose hazards to shipping because they ​lack safety certification and adequate insurance, experts said.\n\nThat means that if they have ​a collision or oil spill, establishing insurance claims or liability is very difficult to impossible, shipping and insurance industry sources said.\n\nThe age of these tankers, which exceeds the industry standard of 15 years, also raises ‍concern about potential environmental damage, the ⁠sources said.\n\nU.S. government civil forfeiture claims related to the ship seizures can take months or years to resolve, meaning there may be no immediate solutions to the challenges.\n\n\"These 'dark fleet' tankers can be incredibly unsafe. They are elderly, their crew ⁠work in unsafe conditions, lack the appropriate classification surveys, and they are often backed by fake insurance or no insurance at all,\" said David Tannenbaum, ‌a director at consulting firm Blackstone Compliance Services.",

    "description": "Integrated energy giant Chevron has a strong business, an attractive yield, and a rock-solid balance sheet.",
    "fullText": "Energy is integral to the world, and every investor should probably have some exposure to the sector.\n\nChevron is one of the world's largest integrated energy companies, providing diversification across the energy sector.\n\nChevron offers an attractive combination of yield and financial strength, relative to its closest peers.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Chevron ›\n\nThe world is trying to shift away from dirtier energy sources, such as coal and oil. However, it's likely to be a long transition. Oil and natural gas will both be needed for decades to come, as the most likely energy strategy is an \"all of the above\" approach.\n\nEvery investor should probably have some exposure to the energy sector. That's the foundational reason why you should consider adding Chevron (NYSE: CVX) to your portfolio. Here are three company-specific reasons why.\n\nThe energy sector is volatile by nature, with oil and natural gas prices rising and falling regularly. You could focus on a narrow niche of the industry, but most investors will be best served by a company with a diversified portfolio of assets that provide exposure to the entire energy value chain. That's what integrated energy companies like Chevron do.\n\nChevron is best known for its oil and natural gas production, which falls into the upstream segment of the industry. However, it also owns energy infrastructure assets, such as pipelines, which help move oil and natural gas around the world.\n\nThat's the midstream. It also owns chemical and refining businesses that operate in the downstream segment of the industry. These businesses process energy into the products that actually get used, like gasoline.\n\nEach segment of the industry operates a little differently through the energy cycle. The best example of the benefit is that low oil prices put pressure on upstream producers but reduce costs in the downstream segment, where oil is a key input into the production of other products. From a foundational perspective, integrated Chevron has an attractive business model.\n\nChevron's dividend yield is currently 4.1%. That's well above the S&P 500 index's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) 1.1% yield and the 3.3% yield of the average energy stock. Chevron clearly has an attractive yield on an absolute level.\n\nChevron, however, doesn't have the highest yield among its closest integrated energy peers. That title goes to TotalEnergies at around 5.9%. However, Chevron does have an over 30-year streak of annual dividend increases behind it. That's second in the sector to ExxonMobil's over-40-year streak, but Exxon's yield is only around 3.1%. All in, Chevron is a reliable dividend stock with an attractive yield that stands out from its peers.",

    "fullText": "The president wants big tech to pay more for electricity, but he’s curbing renewable projects that could boost supply\n\nDonald Trump is worried about datacenters. Specifically, he is concerned about their effects on an already expensive electricity market in the United States. Will Americans’ resentment of sharply rising energy costs scuttle his party’s November election ambitions?\n\nThe US president’s anxiety is evident in two actions in recent weeks. On 13 January, Trump and Microsoft’s president jointly announced that the tech giant would pay more for its datacenters, paying full property taxes and accepting neither tax reductions nor electricity rate discounts in towns where it operates datacenters.\n\n“We are the ‘HOTTEST’ Country in the World, and Number One in AI. Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must ‘pay their own way.’” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Thank you, and congratulations to Microsoft.”\n\nOn 16 January, Trump and governors of states in the north-east US directed the country’s largest power grid operator to hold an emergency reliability power auction by September, per Bloomberg. The move could force tech giants to pay for the construction of new power plants by requiring them to bid on the future reliability of the electricity they plan to draw from the grid.\n\n“I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,” Trump said.\n\nOpenAI followed Microsoft’s lead with an announcement on 20 January. The company committed to “paying our own way on energy, so that our operations don’t increase your electricity prices”. The company is part of the Stargate collaboration between the AI industry and the Trump administration to invest $500bn in AI infrastructure.\n\nTrump is tugging at the edges of the problem of rapidly rising electricity demand. He promised Americans he’d slash their electricity bills by half. But as the Guardian reported just after Trump and Microsoft made their joint proclamation, there’s little prospect of him delivering on that vow. At the same time that AI is increasing the demand for electricity, the administration is blocking renewable energy projects Trump calls a “scam” and a “con job” but were set to provide electricity for millions of US homes, instead pushing the expansion of drilling for gas and oil. Administration edicts to reverse the closure of ageing coal plants and to restart the overseas export of liquified natural gas could counterintuitively raise costs further for domestic consumers.\n\nPower prices play into larger concerns about the cost of living in the US, an issue that has Trump’s party on its back foot as congressional elections loom in November.\n\nAs ever with technology news, Elon Musk is part of the story. On 15 January, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruled that Musk’s company xAI had illegally been operating methane-powered generators at its Memphis facility. The ruling establishes a precedent for tech companies in search of more electricity than they can obtain from the grid: you can’t simply bring in a backup generator, like a homeowner would do when facing a regular power outage. You’ll have to purchase nuclear power plants like Meta, Microsoft, Google and Amazon have. Musk and xAI have not commented.\n\nEuropean governments are likewise confronting the limitations their resources pose on the potential growth of datacenters, which are limitlessly hungry. In Germany, which boasts the highest number of datacenters in Europe, high energy prices constrain growth. Chancellor Friedrich Merz, like Trump, is very much in favor of constructing more datacenters but has taken an opposite tack to the US president’s deal with Microsoft. In November, Merz’s ruling party agreed to subsidize heavy industrial use of electricity until 2028 and reduce grid fees for consumers and businesses alike. One important distinction from the US: datacenters in Germany are required to source half of their electricity from renewable sources. Germans are skeptical of the tech industry’s ability to abide by the requirement, which leads to general wariness of expanding datacenter construction, according to a survey published in October.\n\nIn the UK, home to the second-highest number of datacenters in Europe, construction of new facilities is expanding, and energy costs are rising. Electricity rates in the UK are already multiple times those in the US and among the highest in the world, and increases pose severe problems for a populace that has dealt with a cost-of-living crisis for multiple years now. Despite the brewing problem, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology proposed in November to offer electricity discounts to datacenters in so-called “AI growth zones” to encourage investment and development.\n\nA nearby example looms large: in neighboring Ireland, datacenters’ electricity use overtook that of all urban homes in 2024. The strain on the grid has led to significantly higher costs for everyday Irish people, so much so that the Irish government imposed a ban on new datacenters connecting to Dublin’s power grid in 2021. The measure effectively prohibited new construction in the city and its surrounding area. It ended in December.\n\nThe next stops in the datacenter boom are locales with resource limitations of different sorts. Trump and the tech giants have committed to constructing one of the largest datacenters in the world in the United Arab Emirates and several more facilities elsewhere in the Gulf states. Energy is cheap in the region, but the billions of liters of water that datacenters need to cool off is scarce. Microsoft, Amazon and Meta have likewise announced $17bn in investment in data centers in India, where electricity availability is far less reliable than in the US or Europe. Part of the promised cash may be needed to fund the modernization of the grid, or, as has been the case in the city of Mumbai, local governments may keep ageing infrastructure in use longer than intended, worsening pollution.",

The French navy is escorting the ship to anchorage for more checks, the statement said. The tanker departed from the city of Murmansk in northwestern Russia, it said.\n\nOil revenue is a key part of Russia’s economy, allowing President Vladimir Putin to pour money into the war effort against Ukraine without worsening inflation for everyday people and avoiding a currency collapse.\n\nFrance and other countries have vowed to crack down on the sanction-busting shadow fleet of oil tankers which experts estimate numbers over 400 ships. They are also trying to secure deals with flag-carrying countries to make it easier to board the vessels.\n\nRussia is using what is described as a “shadow fleet” to evade sanctions over its war on Ukraine. The fleet is a compilation of aging vessels and tankers owned by nontransparent entities with addresses in non-sanctioning countries, and sailing under flags from such countries.\n\n“We are determined to uphold international law and to ensure the effective enforcement of sanctions,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said in a post about the interception, with a photo showing a French helicopter hovering over a ship.\n\n“The activities of the ‘shadow fleet’ contribute to financing the war of aggression against Ukraine,” Macron added.\n\nThe French mission was conducted together with the U.K, which gathered and shared intelligence that enabled the ship to be intercepted, according to French military officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the operation.\n\nThe ship was operating under a false flag from the Comoros islands, which are off east Africa, and its crew is Indian, the officials said. It was intercepted in the western Mediterranean, off the southern Spanish coastal town of Almeria, the officials said.\n\nLast September, French naval forces boarded another oil tanker off the French Atlantic coas t that Macron also linked to the shadow fleet. That tanker traveled from the Russian oil terminal in Primorsk near Saint Petersburg. Known as “Pushpa” or “Boracay\" — its name was changed several times — the ship was sailing under the flag of Benin.\n\nPutin denounced that interception as an act of piracy and alleged that Macron initiated the move to deflect attention from French domestic problems.\n\nThe tanker's captain will go on trial in February over the crew’s alleged refusal to cooperate, according to French judicial authorities.",

The S&P 500 Energy Index rose as much as 2.8% to $753.48 on Wednesday, making it the best performing sector in the S&P 500 Index. If the gain holds, that would mark the first record close for the group since April 2024.

    "fullText": "JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli forces on Tuesday targeted at least two United Nations facilities, pushing forward with a crackdown against the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees tasked with delivering humanitarian services to millions of people across the region.\n\nCrews began bulldozing the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ’s offices in Sheikh Jarrah and fired tear gas at a vocational school in Qalandia, marking Israel’s latest and most dramatic step against UNRWA.\n\nIsrael has long railed against the agency, accusing it of being infiltrated by Hamas and saying that some of its employees were involved in the October 2023 attack that triggered Israel’s two-year war in Gaza. UNRWA leaders have said they took swift action against the employees accused of taking part in the attack, and have denied allegations that the agency tolerates or collaborates with Hamas.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday condemned Israel’s destruction of the agency's compound and called for it to be returned to the U.N.'s control.\n\n“The Secretary-General views as wholly unacceptable the continued escalatory actions against UNRWA, which are inconsistent with Israel’s clear obligations under international law,\" said Farhan Haq, the deputy U.N. spokesperson.\n\nRoland Friedrich, the agency's West Bank director, said UNRWA received word that demolition crews and police arrived at their east Jerusalem headquarters early on Tuesday. Staff have not operated out of the facility for almost a year out of safety concerns, but Israeli forces confiscated devices and forced out private security guards protecting the facility.\n\n“What we saw today is the culmination of two years of incitement and measures against UNRWA in east Jerusalem,” Friedrich said.\n\nHe said forces also began firing tear gas outside the vocational school on the outskirts of Jerusalem on Tuesday afternoon before ultimately leaving. More than 300 young refugees receive job training in technology and welding there.\n\nSome children on their way home from the school were overcome by the tear gas and a 15-year-old was hit in the eye with a rubber bullet, according to the Palestinian Authority’s Jerusalem governorate, which monitors Palestinian affairs in the area.\n\nIsraeli leaders celebrate demolition\n\nIsrael’s Foreign Ministry said the demolition enforced a new law banning UNRWA, noting that Israel owns the site and rejecting UNRWA’s claims that the move violated international law.\n\nIsrael has long claimed the agency has an anti-Israel bias. Often with little evidence, it says UNRWA employs and maintains ties with militant groups including Hamas. The U.N. has ardently denied such claims and UNRWA has said it acts quickly to purge any suspected militants among its staff.\n\nUNRWA's mandate is to provide aid and services to some 2.5 million Palestinian refugees in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem, as well as 3 million more refugees in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. The group has for years maintained infrastructure in refugee camps and also run schools and provided health care. But its operations were curtailed last year when Israel’s Knesset passed legislation severing ties and banning it from functioning in what it defines as Israel — including east Jerusalem.\n\nThe agency said the demolitions could imperil operations at the vocational center in Qalandia and heath facility in Shu'afat, where it still provides education and health services.\n\nAn Israeli flag was seen hoisted above the facility in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, where some Israeli politicians arrived on the scene to celebrate the organization's fate. National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir called it “a historic day.”\n\nThe demolition marked the culmination of years of criticism from Israel and its leaders. Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war more than two years ago, it has ramped up such attacks, saying the militants used UNRWA facilities and seized aid. It has provided little evidence for the claims, which the U.N. has denied. The International Court of Justice said in October that Israel must allow the agency to provide humanitarian assistance in Gaza.\n\nSince Israel passed its law banning the agency last year, its facilities — schools and health centers — and its headquarters have repeatedly been closed, raided or left unprotected.\n\n“This must be a wake-up call,\" Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA's commissioner-general, said in a statement on X. “What happens today to UNRWA will happen tomorrow to any other international organisation or diplomatic mission, whether in the Occupied Palestinian Territory or anywhere around the world.”\n\nMore aid groups in Gaza face pressure\n\nIsrael's ban on UNRWA dovetailed with broader efforts to deregister aid groups operating in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Israel has passed laws requiring nongovernmental organizations not to hire staff involved in activities that “delegitimize Israel” or support boycotts, demanding they register lists of names as a condition of being allowed to work.\n\nIsrael told dozens of groups — including Doctors Without Borders and CARE — that their licenses would expire at the end of 2025. The organizations say the rules are arbitrary and warned that the new ban would harm people desperately in need of humanitarian aid.\n\nSettler violence in the West Bank rose last year\n\nThe Israeli military said Tuesday that attacks carried out by Jewish settlers against Palestinians and Israeli security forces in the West Bank increased by 27% last year compared with 2024.\n\nThere were 867 reports of “nationalistic crimes” — with the number of severe incidents up by more than 50%, according to internal statistics from the Israeli military and the country’s Shin Bet domestic security service.\n\nMounting settler violence in the West Bank has emptied villages since the war between Israel and Hamas erupted, according to B’Tselem, an Israeli rights group helping the residents.\n\nThe Israeli military has carried out large-scale operations in the West Bank targeting militants that have killed hundreds of Palestinians. There also has been a rise in Palestinian attacks on Israelis.\n\nIsraeli authorities have a mixed relationship with settlers, at times dismantling unauthorized outposts while also deploying forces to protect them from Palestinians.\n\nJulia Frankel and Shlomo Mor in Jerusalem and Edith M.

    "title": "We Asked a Cardiologist How Long You Need to Take Fish Oil to Improve Heart Health—The Answer Might Surprise You",
    "description": "For most people, this diet tweak is a more powerful gamechanger for heart health.",
    "fullText": "Reviewed by Dietitian Maria Laura Haddad-Garcia\n\nPrescription fish oil may lower high triglycerides and reduce heart risks in 4 to 12 weeks.\n\nOver-the-counter fish oil supplements vary in quality and may not offer the same benefits.\n\nEating fatty fish twice a week is a proven way to support heart health without supplements.\n\nFish oil is a well-known source of omega-3 fatty acids, nutrients found in high concentrations in the eyes and brain. Unlike other nutrients, your body can’t make omega-3s on its own, so it’s important to get them through food—like fish—or supplements.\n\nOften, fish oil is touted for its heart-health benefits, but taking a supplement isn’t right for everyone—and improvements aren't always immediate. We spoke with a cardiologist to break down the science, expectations and timeline for fish oil’s impact on heart health.\n\nFish oil contains two key omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in varying amounts, which are often marketed as heart-healthy. You may have seen them marketed as a way to promote heart health. But before reaching for a supplement, consider this: the research is not promising for most people.\n\n\"There have been many studies conducted on fish oils over the years. Although some have shown benefit in select populations, when used for prevention in otherwise healthy patients, multiple, well-conducted, very large trials have not shown a benefit,\" says Eugenia Gianos, M.D., FACC, chair of the American College of Cardiology's Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease Council and director of cardiovascular prevention at Northwell Health.\n\nTaking fish oil without a medical reason may even be harmful. Some studies have linked fish oil supplements with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heart rhythm, adds Gianos. They should be used in patients where the benefits are likely to be greater,” she says—primarily those with very high triglycerides. Triglycerides are a type of fat in the blood, and elevated levels can increase the risk of plaque buildup in the arteries, potentially leading to a heart attack or stroke.\n\nIn addition, it's also important to consider the type of fish oil that physicians recommend for high triglycerides: prescription fish oil. That’s because over-the-counter supplements are not FDA-approved for managing high triglycerides, and their quality and dosage can vary widely. Many also contain impurities.\n\nAnother key difference is dosage. Prescription fish oil delivers a much higher dose of omega-3s than over-the-counter supplements. To reach a similar amount using nonprescription fish oil, you’d need to take multiple capsules, which can increase the likelihood of gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea and the unpleasant “fish burps” many people experience.\n\nPrescription versions, such as icosapent ethyl (Vascepa), deliver a much higher dose of EPA and have been shown to reduce inflammation, stabilize arterial plaque and lower the risk of heart attack and stroke, notes Gianos.\n\nBack to the question at hand, though: When will you notice a benefit? If your healthcare provider recommends taking a prescription fish oil medication to lower your triglycerides, you should see a benefit in about 4 to 12 weeks, adds Gianos.\n\nAlthough you can easily purchase fish oil supplements at the store or online, first make sure your healthcare provider recommends you take one. For lowering triglycerides, the typical dose is 2 grams twice daily, taken with meals.\"Fish oils are generally very safe. They are unlikely to interact with other medications and are well tolerated,\" says Gianos.\n\nFor most people, though, the best way to get omega-3s for heart-health benefits is through food.  Fatty fish such as salmon, sardines, mackerel, anchovies, bluefin tuna, mussels and oysters are all excellent sources. \"This has been a guideline recommendation for decades due to research showing benefits for the prevention of heart disease and can be a healthy way to get important protective nutrients,\" she explains.\n\nThe American Heart Association recommends eating fish twice a week—a target that supports heart health without the need for supplements in most cases.\n\nFish oil supplements are often thought to be great for your heart, but evidence doesn’t support their use for everyone. Plus, in some cases, it can lead to harm or unpleasant side effects. If you’re managing high triglycerides, prescription fish oil may offer measurable benefits within a few weeks. But for most people, eating fish regularly is a stronger, more established strategy for supporting heart health.",

    "description": "In developing EnergyNet we have leveraged and are extending lessons from telecom's shift from a centralized, circuit-switched phone system to decentralized, packet-switched data networks. EnergyNet utilizes 1) an Energy Router that enforces galvanic separation and utilizes software-controlled energy flows over a DC backplane, 2) Energy Local and Wide Area Networks (ELAN/EWAN) based on DC microgrids that interconnect through an open Energy Protocol (EP), and 3) a control plane comprised of the Energy Router Operating System (EROS) and EP Server which is managed at operator scale through an Energy Network Management System (ENMS). We distinguish the architectural contribution (Tier-1 including components, interfaces, and operating model) from expected outcomes contingent on adoption (Tier-2). The latter includes local-first autonomy with global interoperability, near-real-time operation with local buffering, removal of EV-charging bottlenecks, freed grid capacity for data centers and industrial electrification, as well as a trend toward low, predictable, fixed-cost clean energy. Evidence from early municipal demonstrators illustrates feasibility and migration paths.",

    "fullText": "MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. announced Monday the discovery of a new natural gas deposit near the disputed South China Sea, which could shield his country from a potential power crisis.\n\nThe “significant discovery\" northwest off Palawan province, close to an existing gas field in waters adjacent to the critical waterway, could eventually supply power to more than 5.7 million households or nearly 200,000 schools for a year, Marcos said, adding further tests and another drilling in the area would be done “to pursue more potential gas resources.\"\n\nThe undersea reservoir is estimated to contain about 98 billion cubic feet (2.7 billion cubic meters) of gas. Initial tests showed 60 million cubic feet (1.6 million cubic meters) of gas could be extracted daily from the well, Marcos said, without providing further details, including when commercial production could start.\n\n“This helps Malampaya’s contribution and strengthens our domestic gas supply for many years to come,” Marcos said. “Aside from the natural gas, the discovery also includes condensate, which is a high-value liquid fuel.”\n\nThe new gas deposit, called Malampaya East 1, was discovered by a consortium about 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) east of the main Malampaya gas field, where commercial gas production started more than two decades ago and was projected to considerably decline in a few years.\n\n“We're proud that Filipinos led this drilling and, more importantly, they completed it without any accident or environmental incidents,” Marcos said.\n\nThe Malampaya gas-to-power facility has generated more than 20% of Luzon's electricity, the most populous northern Philippine island region. In 2023, Marcos extended an exploration contract in Malampaya by 15 years.\n\nExperts have predicted Malampaya could run out of gas in a few years, sparking fears of a potential power crisis in Luzon, where the bustling capital and main financial and business district is located.\n\nThe offshore gas field lies within the country’s Exclusive Economic Zone of the Philippines, a 200-nautical-mile (370-kilometer) stretch of water from a country’s coastline where it has exclusive rights to explore and harness resources under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\n\nPhilippine efforts to explore for oil and gas in another offshore region, the Reed Bank, have been stalled for years because of opposition from Beijing, which claims sovereignty over the area along with most of the South China Sea. The Reed Bank also lies in the fringes of the South China Sea west of the Philippine island province of Palawan.\n\nChina has opposed Vietnam’s oil and gas exploration in the disputed region. Beijing claims virtually the entire South China Sea and has reinforced its presence, including coast guard and naval patrols in the disputed waterway in recent years.\n\nMalaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have also been involved in the region's long-simmering territorial standoffs.",

    "fullText": "Cameron Brink is on a mission to get jacked.\n\nSure, she's is already a pro athlete for the WNBA. But the Los Angeles Sparks forward has become \"kind of a snob\" about building muscle.\n\n\"I'm stronger than I've ever been, and that's because I've tried to be genuinely intentional about what I'm putting in my body and my routine,\" she told me for Business Insider.\n\nBrink recently gushed over Zoom with me about her favorite strength training exercises (Bulgarian split squats) and equipment (a Keiser leg extension machine at her trainer's house), laughing a little at herself. It's a level of gym nerdiness that would have been unheard of for her a few years ago.\n\nBut \"that's what ACL recovery does to you,\" Brink said. Last season marked her return from a 2024 injury, and since then, she's been all about lifting weights.\n\nFor maximum muscle-building, Brink has also doubled down on optimizing protein, partnering with nutrition app MyFitnessPal, which she uses to stay on track.\n\n\"Something I never realized is how much protein I actually need,\" she said.\n\nAt a listed height of 6' 4\" (Brink said she's actually an inch taller), getting enough fuel can feel like a full-time job.\n\n\"I'm doing things that the average person doesn't do. So that's where I really needed to start tracking my protein and my macros. And it really made a huge difference,\" Brink said.\n\nThe rising star of women's basketball gave me the rundown on her low-stress approach to food tracking, and what's on the menu for a typical day in her life.\n\nBrink's game plan for good nutrition starts the night before a busy day.\n\nIn the evenings, she preps the next day's breakfast: overnight oats or chia pudding, mixed with protein powder, berries, and honey.\n\nThe combo is full of carbohydrates for energy, including quick-digesting carbs for a short-term boost, along with slower-digesting complex carbs so Brink can stay full and focused on training. Her breakfast also packs in plenty of protein for muscle growth and fiber for gut health.\n\nNext up is coffee — Brink saves it for after the first meal of the day, to help provide more stable energy and prevent a crash later.\n\n\"I've shifted to having my caffeine after I have my breakfast, which I feel like has made a huge difference,\" she said.\n\nBrink also has a daily supplement regimen that includes iron, vitamin D, and muscle-building creatine.\n\nThen comes a chef-prepared lunch at the Sparks' training facility, where Brink often opts for two pieces of salmon with a side of Japanese sweet potatoes and asparagus. Lunch is followed by a nap.\n\nThroughout the day, Brink said she relies on snacks like bananas, dates with almond butter, or almonds.\n\nBefore a game, her go-to fuel source is classic peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.\n\n\"I love peanut butter and jelly. That's what really fuels me through the game is just having some of the protein from the peanut butter, but a lot of carbs,\" she said.\n\nOn nights when she's not playing, Brink makes dinner with her fiancé, former Stanford rower Ben Felter, who handles the protein while she preps the sides like pasta salad or baked potatoes.\n\nBrink also treats herself, especially on the weekends, with food from Dave's Hot Chicken or In-N-Out Burger.\n\nShe said it's important to keep a flexible approach to eating so she doesn't feel guilty or obsess over what's on her plate.\n\n\"I'm not going to beat myself up like, 'Oh, I should have had 30 more grams of protein or something.' It's just something I can build on for the next day,\" Brink said.",

    "fullText": "Jan 18 (Reuters) - Syrian troops fighting U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces seized the Omar oil field, the country’s largest, and the Conoco gas field in the eastern Deir Zor province as allied Arab tribal forces advanced ​in the oil-rich area along the border with Iraq, officials and security sources said on Sunday.\n\nThe takeover ‌of the oil fields that lie east of the Euphrates River — a main source of revenue for the Kurdish-led forces — was a major blow to ‌the group.\n\nSyrian government officials said the oil wealth the militia had controlled to sustain its self-administered region had deprived the state of much‑needed resources.\n\nSyrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa said last week it was unacceptable for a militia to control a quarter of the country and hold its main oil and commodities resources.\n\nThe Syrian army pressed ahead into predominantly Arab-populated areas of northeast Syria controlled ⁠by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), despite ‌U.S. calls to halt its advance.\n\nA government source said Kurdish-led forces were overcome after advances led by the Arab tribal fighters, allowing the government and its tribal allies to move into ‍a stretch of territory of more than 150 km along the eastern bank of the Euphrates stretching from Baghouz near the Iraqi border towards key towns, including al-Shuhail and Busayra.\n\nSyrian government officials said the advances effectively brought most of Deir al-Zor province — the country’s main ​oil- and wheat-producing area along the Euphrates — under their control.\n\nLate on Saturday, the army also took control of the ‌northern city of Tabqa and its adjacent dam, as well as the major Freedom Dam, formerly known as the Baath Dam, west of Raqqa.\n\nSyrian Kurdish authorities have not acknowledged the loss of those strategic sites and said fighting continued near the dam area, accusing Damascus of breaching an agreement on the withdrawal of forces from areas east of Aleppo to expand its offensive.\n\nSyrian Kurdish officials said factions aligned with the government were attacking their forces despite efforts to reach a peaceful ⁠outcome. The civil administration that runs the region said Damascus was intent ​on sowing divisions between Arabs and Kurds.\n\n“We are at a critical ​juncture. We either resist or live in dignity and face all types of injustice,” their statement said, urging residents of the majority-Arab areas to stand by the SDF.\n\n“We call on our people, especially ‍the youth, to take up arms ⁠and prepare to resist any attack. We are facing a war for our survival,” it added.\n\nThe government had called on SDF fighters — most of whom are from Arab tribes — to defect. It says hundreds have already ⁠switched sides and joined tribal forces fighting the SDF.\n\nDozens of Arab tribal leaders have said they had been marginalised under Kurdish leadership, a claim ‌the SDF denies, saying its ranks reflect the diversity of Syrian society.",

The strikes aim to weaken Ukrainians’ will to resist in a strategy that Kyiv officials call “weaponizing winter.”\n\nRussia targeted energy infrastructure in Odesa region overnight on Sunday, according to Ukraine’s Emergency Service. A fire broke out and was promptly extinguished.\n\nAt least six people were wounded in the Dnipropetrovsk region from Russian attacks, the emergency service said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a Telegram post that repairing the country’s energy system remains challenging, “but we are doing everything we can to restore everything as quickly as possible.”\n\nHe said that two people were killed in overnight attacks across the country that struck Sumy, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia, Khmelnytskyi and Odesa.\n\nIn total, more than 1,300 attack drones, 1,050 guided aerial bombs and 29 missiles of various types were used by Russia to strike Ukraine this week, Zelenskyy said.\n\n“If Russia deliberately delays the diplomatic process, the world’s response should be decisive: more help for Ukraine and more pressure on the aggressor,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe spoke the day after a Ukrainian delegation arrived in the United States for talks on a U.S.-led diplomatic push to end the war.\n\nOn Friday, Zelenskyy said that the delegation would try to finalize with U.S. officials documents for a proposed peace settlement that relate to postwar security guarantees and economic recovery.\n\nIf American officials approve the proposals, the U.S. and Ukraine could sign the documents next week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Zelenskyy said at a Kyiv news conference with Czech President Petr Pavel. Trump plans to be in Davos, according to organizers.\n\nRussia would still need to be consulted on the proposals.\n\nSeparately, in Russia’s Caucasus mountains, two children and an adult were wounded overnight as debris from a Ukrainian drone fell on a five-story residential building in North Ossetia, according to the regional governor.\n\nSeventy people had to be evacuated from the building, in the town of Beslan, and there was damage to its roof and windows, Gov. Sergei Menyaylo said in a Telegram post on Sunday morning.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said that its forces shot down or suppressed 63 Ukrainian drones overnight over Russia and the occupied Crimean Peninsula. One person was hospitalized in Russia’s Krasnodar region east of Crimea following a drone strike, local authorities said.\n\nUkrainian crews have started repair works on the backup power line connecting the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to the power grid, under a ceasefire brokered by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Vienna-based U.N. organization said in an X post on Sunday.\n\nThe fate of the plant, occupied by Russia and the largest in Europe, is a central issue in ongoing U.S.-brokered peace talks.\n\n“Crucial repair works on the essential back up Ferosplavna-1 330 kV power line connecting Ukraine’s ZNPP to the grid have begun under another IAEA-brokered ceasefire,” the agency said in the post.\n\nThe 330-kilovolt power line, which was damaged and disconnected because of fighting, is crucial to supplying the plant with electricity.",

    "fullText": "UK gas prices don't form in isolation - they're the result of a global system where LNG tankers move molecules across oceans, storage facilities buffer seasonal demand swings, and physical constraints create friction that simple supply-demand models miss.\n\nThis guide explains the infrastructure and economics that connect US shale production to UK power plants. You'll learn how LNG shipping works, why UK gas prices track Henry Hub (Louisiana) with a 6-8 week lag, and how traders calculate netback prices to decide whether exporting US gas to Europe is profitable. You'll see why LNG is the flexible marginal source while Norwegian pipelines provide inflexible baseload, and how charter rate volatility (which spiked 5x in 2025) can turn a profitable cargo into a loss overnight.\n\nThe guide also covers the UK's structural vulnerability: storage capacity below 2% of annual demand (versus 20% in continental Europe). You'll understand why this makes UK prices volatile, how storage arbitrage works (and why most seasonal spreads don't cover storage costs), and why NBP can decouple from TTF despite physical interconnection - a basis risk that's burned countless traders who assumed prices would converge.\n\nYou'll work through real calculations: shipping costs for Atlantic crossings, netback comparisons between European and Asian markets, and storage break-even analysis using German salt caverns. By the end, you'll see how global gas dynamics feed directly into the spark spread formulas you'll learn next.\n\nPhysical Foundations taught you why gas plants set marginal power prices. This guide shows you where gas prices come from - the global infrastructure that determines the fuel input cost. Next, you'll learn spark spreads (power minus gas minus carbon), which combine gas prices with power and carbon markets to identify profitable generation opportunities.\n\nComplete the Physical Foundations guide first. You need to understand merit order dispatch and why gas-fired plants are marginal price-setters. No prior trading experience required.\n\nTrack Henry Hub and NBP prices online or on TradingView for a month. When Henry Hub makes a significant move, set a calendar reminder for 6-8 weeks and check whether NBP followed. The lag will become intuitive, not theoretical.\n\nGet the complete guide in PDF format for offline reading and reference.",

I could say that and blame [the decision], but we will not grow up and move forward.\n\n\"It happened and it is not a surprise, it happened in the past when I arrived here. Honestly, we have to look at ourselves. If the players have excuses, we will be in trouble in the future.\n\n\"We have to look at ourselves and today the analysis is simple - Manchester United were better and we have to accept it.\"\n\nFormer Premier League official Darren Cann told BBC Sport he thought Dalot was \"very fortunate to escape a red card\".\n\n\"It's a hard one to see at normal speed live on the pitch from the referee's angle but with the benefit of replays I do feel that Dalot is very fortunate not receive a red card,\" he added.\n\n\"Had the referee been invited to the screen I am sure he would have been shown a red card.\"\n\nInterim United boss Carrick said: \"I am not giving you that [Guardiola's] answer, I have not seen it but I thought at the time Diogo got the ball and kicked it out. I did not think for one second it was a bad challenge. I got told later it was a lack of force [that meant he was not shown red].\"\n\nFollowing this loss and draws against Sunderland, Chelsea and Brighton, City are now winless in their last four league games and have handed a major advantage to Mikel Arteta's Arsenal.\n\nCity are close to completing the £20m signing of Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi to bolster the defence but the arduous schedule now appears to be catching up with City's front players.\n\nStriker Erling Haaland is in a barren run of form, scoring just once - from the penalty spot - in his last seven games and without a goal from open play since 20 December.\n\nThe Norwegian was out-battled by United defender Lisandro Martinez on Saturday, managing just 14 touches of the ball in the entire game and failing to manage a shot on target.\n\nPhil Foden has gone eight straight games without scoring while substitute Rayan Cherki, who scored late on at Newcastle during the week, was unable to influence the game.\n\nCity's expected goal (xG) rate of 0.45 in the contest was the second lowest recorded in Guardiola's 364 games in charge in the Premier League.\n\nThe 54-year-old, who celebrates his birthday on Sunday, told BBC Match of the Day: \"We were not good enough up front. We could not do it. I had a feeling we didn't have and they had it and they deserve it.\n\n\"Normally in the beginning of the game when they come to Etihad Stadium our rhythm is another one and it's normal doing that.\n\n\"Offensively we did not have the intention in the final third to score a goal, to make a cross, to make a movement. We were more predictable.\"\n\nCity will aim to get their season back on track with a trip to Bodo/Glimt in the Champions League on Tuesday.\n\nDespite boasting 68% of the possession, City were limited to one shot on target and the second lowest xG of Guardiola’s Premier League career.\n\nUnited looked to funnel City into wide areas before defending intensely with four players. On the left, for example, Bruno Fernandes, Patrick Dorgu, Kobbie Mainoo and Luke Shaw converged to reduce the time and space City had.\n\nThe number of players committed to the side the ball was on meant the space was on the far side, but City struggled to switch the point of attack, something Antoine Semenyo, Jeremy Doku and Rico Lewis do less of than some of their team-mates.\n\nPhil Foden on the right wing or Matheus Nunes have shown this ability in the past and the latter was a particular miss.\n\nCity lacked Nunes’ physical profile to help deal with United’s threat on transition by tracking the runs of Patrick Dorgu and aiding Rodri, who found himself having to deal with both Mbeumo and Bruno at times.\n\nWhen penned back, United defended in a way that gave time and space to the City centre-backs more than anybody else.\n\nBut, despite stopping numerous counter-attacks, when he had possession Abdukodir Khusanov struggled to take advantage of the spaces United left, as did Nathan Ake and Max Alleyne.\n\nTheir lack of ball-playing quality meant City struggled in a way they may not have done if they'd had the injured Josko Gvardiol, John Stones and Ruben Dias on the pitch.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 15 (Reuters) - India's Russian oil imports fell to their lowest level in two years in December, as Western sanctions pushed refiners to tap alternatives, ​lifting OPEC's share of imports to an 11-month high, trade data showed.\n\nLower imports of Russian ‌oil, sold at a discount, is likely to hit profits of refiners in the world's third largest oil importer and consuming ‌nation and push them to turn to suppliers in the Middle East, the U.S. and South America.\n\nTighter U.S. and European Union sanctions have slowed Russian oil flows to India, with imports dropping about 22% to 1.38 million barrels per day in December from the previous month, reducing Russia's share to 27.4%, the lowest since ⁠January 2023, while OPEC's share rose to ‌53.2%, the data showed.\n\nReliance Industries, the largest Indian buyer of Russian oil, stopped receiving crude under its deal with Rosneft in the final 10 days of December, ‍with its imports from Russia falling to a nearly two-year low, the data showed.\n\nState refiners, meanwhile, continued to source Russian oil from non-sanctioned suppliers.\n\nDespite the drop, Russia remained the top supplier of oil to India ​in December and during first nine of this fiscal year to March 31, 2026, followed by Iraq ‌and Saudi Arabia.\n\nSome cargoes that arrived in December, however, were discharged in January, the data showed.\n\nIndia's Russian oil imports are expected to average around 1.2 million to 1.4 million bpd in January, with the pullback looking more like a short-term disruption from compliance issues rather than India moving away from Russia completely, said Sumit Ritola, lead research analyst, refining and modelling at Kpler.\n\nTo keep track of refiners' oil purchases, ⁠the Indian government is seeking weekly details on crude purchases ​from Russia and the U.S.\n\nFor 2025, OPEC's share ​of India's crude imports edged up to 50%, from 49% from a year earlier, while Russia's portion shrank to 33.3% versus 36% in 2024.\n\nIndia emerged as the biggest ‍buyer of discounted Russian seaborne ⁠crude following the start of the Ukraine war in 2022.\n\nThe purchases have fuelled a backlash from Western nations, which have targeted Russia's energy sector with sanctions, arguing that oil revenues help ⁠fund Moscow's war effort.\n\nThe U.S. doubled import tariffs on Indian goods to 50% last year as punishment for its heavy purchasing ‌of Russian oil. The two countries are currently negotiating a potential trade deal.",

    "description": "Ukraine's capital Kyiv has only about half the electricity that it needs as it faces its most severe wartime energy crisis following waves",
    "fullText": "KYIV, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Ukraine's capital Kyiv has only about half the electricity that it needs as it faces its most severe wartime energy crisis following waves ​of Russian attacks on its infrastructure, mayor Vitali Klitschko told Reuters on Friday.\n\nKyiv, one of Eastern ‌Europe's largest cities, requires 1,700 megawatts of electricity to power the services for its 3.6 million people, Klitschko said.\n\nKlitschko said the current energy crisis ‌was the most difficult challenge facing the capital in the nearly four years since Russia's invasion in February 2022.\n\n\"It's the first time in the history of our city that, in such severe frosts, most of the city was left without heating and with a huge shortage of electricity,\" Klitschko, a former world heavyweight boxing champion, said in an interview ⁠in his office at the heart of ‌Kyiv.\n\nSome Kyiv residents face up to 18 to 20 hours a day without mains electricity. Ukraine declared an energy emergency this week as its grid crumbles due to accumulated wartime ‍damage and a new targeted wave of Russian bombardments.\n\nBitter cold weather with icy rain and snow exacerbated the challenges. Nighttime minimum temperatures have dipped to around -17 Celsius (1 Fahrenheit) in Kyiv this week.\n\nFAST REPAIRS, GENERATORS AND INTERNATIONAL AID\n\nKlitschko said Ukraine's international partners had ​rushed in additional generators, and repair teams had worked round the clock to restore heating following a Russian ‌strike last week that knocked out supplies to 6,000 apartment buildings.\n\nAbout 100 buildings still have no heating, he said.\n\n\"We're not just working during the day now, we're working at night too,\" he said. \"There is no such thing as the start and end of the working day for us.\"\n\nIn addition to repairs and generators, the city opened about 1,300 sites with heaters to help residents keep warm, and was working to install mini thermal power stations in ⁠some districts to decentralize electricity and heating.\n\nWith generators, the priority was ​to provide electricity to ensure water supplies and power hospitals, kindergartens, ​and other key critical infrastructure, Klitschko said. About 300 tonnes of fuel a day were needed to do that.\n\nKlitschko reiterated his call for Kyiv residents to leave the city if they ‍have the opportunity to do ⁠so to ease the pressure on its infrastructure.\n\nSchools in Kyiv extended their winter holidays, and many commercial companies have switched to remote work arrangements.\n\nKlitschko said that despite all the challenges, city officials were determined to ⁠restore heating supplies in full, and they were also planning for backup scenarios in case new Russian air strikes damage the energy infrastructure.\n\n\"This ‌winter will be difficult, but we are doing everything that's possible and impossible,\" Klitschko said.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Olena Harmash; editing by Daniel Flynn and Alex Richardson)",

    "description": "Destiny says witnesses quickly started pouring milk on her children to try and alleviate the effects of the tear gas.",
    "fullText": "A family of eight traveling in their car was caught in the crossfire between protestors and ICE agents in northern Minneapolis, and it led to three of their six children — including a six-month-old baby — being hospitalized. Well, I shouldn't really say crossfire, since one group was yelling and throwing snowballs while the other was using live munitions. I'll let you guess which was which.\n\nShawn Jackson, the children's father and the driver of the car, told FOX 9 KMSP at the scene that his children, who are between six months and 11 years old, were hurt when a flashbang stun grenade (or possibly tear gas) detonated nearby. As he stood next to his SUV, which was covered in some sort of chemical residue, Jackson told the reporter that the blast from the non-lethal (but incredibly dangerous) explosive device was strong enough to set off the airbags in what appears to be his GMT800 Chevy Tahoe.\n\nDespite the fact half of Jackon's kids ended up in the hospital, everyone involved is lucky things didn't end much, much worse. Here's what he and his wife, Destiny, told FOX 9:\n\n\"Officers threw flash bangs and tear gas in my car. I got six kids in the car [...] My 6-month-old can't even breathe. This was flipped over,\" Shawn said, holding up his child's car seat. \"My car filled with tear gas, I'm trying to pull my kids from the car.\"\n\nHis wife, Destiny Jackson, told FOX 9 their 6-month-old infant stopped breathing and lost consciousness. She then performed CPR on her baby while others poured milk on her other children in an effort to neutralize the tear gas.\n\nAlong with the six-month old, their 11-year-old and seven-year-old, who has asthma, were hospitalized. Both Jackson parents also had to be treated.\n\nPeople in the area quickly sprang into action to help the Jacksons. Destiny says witnesses quickly started pouring milk on her children to try and alleviate the effects of the tear gas. Others called EMS and coached her through CPR on her infant child.\n\n\"A lot of people from the community were there trying to help us in that situation,\" she said.\n\nI'm fairly certain there are quite a few people who are ready to type FAFO with a cry/laugh emoji into the comments section and say that they shouldn't interfere in government work, but before you do that, take a step back, reevaluate your life and listen to what I'm about to tell you. The Jacksons were not part of any protest.\n\nThey were on their way home from their oldest child's basketball game, and their route just so happened to go by the protests, which they weren't aware were happening. She says they did see police lights and protestors, but the road wasn't blocked and everything was fairly calm, so they continued on their way.\n\nWhile driving through, Shawn briefly stopped to ask people on the street what was happening, and that's when Destiny spotted her mother in the crowd and attempted to get her to leave, \"before anything did happen.\" Destiny says that after about half an hour of pleading with her mother to go home, she agreed, and as they were getting ready to go, ICE descended upon the scene in their cars.\n\n\"A couple of them proceeded to start screaming in my window, and they were saying, 'Get out of here. Get the F- out of here.'\" Destiny told FOX 9. She went on to say that she told the screaming ICE agents that if they moved away from their car, they would gladly leave, which is what they were trying to do the whole time.\n\n\"We know what happened when Renee tried to move. You guys said that she hit you when she didn't,\" Destiny said during the interview. It's not just Renee Good of course, 13 people have been shot at in their cars by ICE agents.\n\nAfter not moving their cars, the Jacksons were stuck. That's when ICE agents walked to the back of their vehicle and rolled a teargas bomb under it, and it went off, according to Destiny. Ghousling behavior.\n\n\"My kids were innocent, I was innocent, my husband was innocent, this shouldn't have happened,\" Destiny said. \"We were just trying to go home.\"\n\nWant more like this?

    "fullText": "A shriek broke the dawn on the savannah, followed by more screeches and the rustle of branches: The wild Fongoli chimps were bidding each other good morning in the dry, scraggly Sahel.\n\nThe rare chimpanzees -- who live in the bush of hot, southeast Senegal rather than the forest as is more common -- exist on the extreme edge of what is possible for their species.\n\nTheir unusual way of living offers clues into humans' own evolutionary past, while their adaptations to the heat appear timely in a world where temperatures are on the rise.\n\nSoaking in pools, cooling off in caves and even wielding spears: The 35 wild chimps of the Fongoli community have adapted to the environment with behaviours that defy their species' conventional norms.\n\nNow, 25 years after starting her pioneering research on savannah chimps, which had never before been habituated to observers, primatologist Jill Pruetz has a wealth of data.\n\nThe study's longevity allows for a deeper dive into the Fongoli community's behaviours, relationships and how they learn from one generation to the next.\n\n\"Until they were habituated to observers so we could follow them around and take data, we only knew chimpanzees from forested areas,\" Pruetz told AFP reporters, who spent two days following her and her team as they tracked the primates in the bush.\n\nThe Fongoli chimps, who live on a 100-square-kilometre (40-square-mile) home range, are only one group of savannah chimps in the region but for years the only one to be studied.\n\nOn a recent morning, A.J., Raffy, Diouf and ambitious young Pistache sat at the top of a baobab, plucking a breakfast of fruit that they cracked open with a whack-whack-whack against the branches.\n\nScreeching, or \"pant-hooting\" as their vocalisations are known, they communicated with other members nearby.\n\nPruetz and her team of Senegalese researchers follow the group's adult males, which currently number 10, choosing one each day to track from dawn to dusk. The females, however, are not followed in order to keep them more wary of poachers.\n\nThe males' strict hierarchy spans from Cy, the alpha, down to Siberut, the oldest and lowest ranking despite his superb hunting skills.\n\nSince the social apes spend much of their time together, Pruetz is still able to observe the females and their young.\n\nIt is the females who have proven the most groundbreaking members of the clan: They are the only non-human animal to systematically use tools to hunt.\n\nIt is a behaviour Pruetz and her researchers have observed almost 600 times.\n\nAfter whittling sticks into spears, usually with their teeth, the females hunt bush babies during the rainy season, impaling the small primates as they shelter in tree holes.\n\nWith the heat index reaching 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) in the hot season, life on the savannah can be gruelling.\n\nThe Fongoli chimps \"have to deal with the hottest area that we've studied chimps in\" Pruetz said, and must \"minimise energy expenditure\" during the dry season.\n\nThey are the only wild chimps in the world known to soak, taking dips in natural pools. They additionally \"use caves to rest in, because the caves are cooler\", Pruetz told AFP.\n\nThe savannah woodlands that are the Fongoli chimps' habitat are similar to those that human ancestors lived in some six or seven million years ago.\n\nWhile the Fongoli chimps' many adaptations mean they are able to deal with \"high heat stress\", Pruetz said, \"we're not sure that with climate change they can continue to do that\".\n\nThe Fongoli apes are members of the critically endangered subspecies of West African chimpanzees.\n\nWhile they have traditionally co-existed alongside humans on their home range, a new threat has emerged: a gold rush which has ushered an increase in both artisanal and industrial mines.\n\nIn the morning, the rumble of rock-grinding machines, which crush through buckets of substrate, could be heard before the savannah's fauna began its daily chorus.\n\nFires burned at artisanal mine sites, where night guards watched over equipment.\n\nMines can mean water pollution, greater resource extraction and the spread of human disease to chimps.\n\nPapa Ibnou Ndiaye, a wildlife researcher and professor at Cheikh Anta Diop University in Dakar, said studying the Fongoli chimpanzees allows \"the local administration to have accurate information to make informed decisions for the conservation of Senegal's biodiversity\".\n\nPruetz spends part of the year teaching at Texas State University, while her four research assistants and project manager, who are originally from nearby villages, continue to track the apes.\n\nThey keep count as Raffy whacks a baobab fruit eight times or note which arm he uses to do so -- although chimps are normally left-handed.\n\nBut they also meticulously track the chimps' friendships and social plights.\n\n\"When someone gets home from being out with the chimps all day, you sit around the supper table and you talk about, what drama? What did Cy do today? What did Pistache do today?\" said Pruetz, who has images of three of the chimp group's deceased or disappeared members tattooed on her arm.\n\nChimpanzees can live up to 50 years in the wild and how their \"relationships change\" is just one of the many interests for Pruetz.",

    "description": "The United States is considering whether to strike Iran as turmoil intensifies for the country’s authoritarian regime.",
    "fullText": "The United States is considering whether to strike Iran as turmoil intensifies for the country’s authoritarian regime.\n\nThe Iranian government is at its weakest point in years, destabilizing yet another OPEC nation less than two weeks after the United States toppled the government of Venezuela.\n\nProtests have erupted in the streets across Iran, and the government’s deadly crackdown on protesters crossed a red line President Donald Trump had drawn. Trump has signaled that his administration is weighing an attack – although on Wednesday, Trump said the United States will continue to “watch and see what the process is” to determine whether to take action against Iran.\n\nIran controls the third-largest proven oil reserves on Earth and one of the world’s most important oil shipping lanes. Those factors will shape the country’s future, regardless of whether the US intervenes.\n\nIran produces about 3.2 million barrels of oil per day, on average, according to OPEC, accounting for roughly 4% of global crude production. That makes Iran the world’s sixth-largest oil producer – an impressive feat, considering Iran faces burdensome worldwide sanctions that have severely limited its potential customers .To skirt sanctions, Iran operates a shadow fleet of vessels to export oil at a steep discount.\n\nBut Iran’s potential far outweighs its actual output. The country is sitting on 209 million barrels of oil in reserve, behind only Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. And its daily production is less than half the 6.5 million barrels per day Iran produced in the mid-1970s before revolutionaries overthrew the Shah.\n\nLike Venezuela, China is by far Iran’s biggest customer: It buys 89% of Iran’s oil, according to the US Energy Information Administration. The similarities don’t end there: Iran also nationalized the country’s energy infrastructure after expropriating foreign oil companies’ assets in past decades.\n\nBut Iran is a much more important for global energy than Venezuela.\n\n“Iran is significantly larger than Venezuela for oil markets,” said Luisa Palacios, a former Citgo chairwoman and current managing director of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “Developments for Iran matter much more for oil markets in the near term, because of the risk of oil supply disruption.”\n\nThe price of oil has already risen sharply because of the threat of disruption to Iran’s oil. Crude rose above $61 a barrel Wednesday in response to threats of an attack on Iran – just a week after oil fell to $56 a barrel when Trump promised US oil companies would ramp up production in Venezuela.",

Kennan senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, in a post on Wednesday.\n\nLoans for Venezuela's purchase of Russian weapons could meet the same fate, added Sestanovich, a former ambassador-at-large for the former Soviet Union at the State Department.\n\n\"The overall market appeal of such arms has clearly been diminished,\" following the US's military operation, he wrote.\n\nSome $2 billion to $3 billion in annual trade between Russia and Venezuela could also \"cease altogether,\" he added.\n\nThose concrete economic losses contrast with more intangible political upsides for Moscow in a shifting global order, he added.\n\n\"The Trump administration's emphasis on preserving a US sphere of influence in the Western Hemisphere could also seem to validate Russia's claims for a similar sphere in its own neighborhood,\" Sestanovich wrote.\n\nThe developments come at a sensitive moment for Russia's economy, as its war in Ukraine approaches its fifth year next month.\n\nSweeping Western sanctions and depressed oil prices are squeezing Russia's revenues, putting pressure on the funds Moscow uses to sustain the war effort and support the broader economy.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has not commented publicly on the US's operation in Venezuela. The Russian foreign ​ministry has called for deposed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's release and for dialogue between the US and Venezuela.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian state-owned oil company Roszarubezhneft sought to draw a line around its oil holdings in Venezuela.

    "description": "Energy regulators and advocates are cautiously optimistic about Microsoft's promise to \"pay its own way\" for the power needed to serve its AI footprint.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft is promising to cover the costs of electricity needed to power its rapidly growing fleet of data centers in suburban and rural communities across the US.\n\nIn a speech on Tuesday, Brad Smith, the president and vice chair of the Big Tech giant, said that going forward, Microsoft will \"pay utility rates that are high enough to cover our electricity costs.\"\n\nIt's a bold pledge to make at a time when AI is fueling a historic surge in demand for power in the US, and electric bills are surging for the average American utility customer.\n\nIt is also one that state regulators have heard before as utilities, their data center customers, and consumer advocates argue over who will bear the cost of new infrastructure needed to serve AI's enormous appetite for power.\n\nBut as the impact of data centers on electricity rates becomes an increasingly hot political flashpoint, Microsoft may have no other choice but to follow through, and the rest of Big Tech might not be far behind.\n\n\"There is no free lunch for tech players, and Trump is watching,\" said Dan Ives, global head of tech research at Wedbush Securities.\n\nIves expects other Big Tech companies to follow Microsoft's lead and make similar pledges addressing local concerns around major data center buildouts sooner rather than later.\n\n\"I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,\" President Trump wrote Monday night in a post on Truth Social.\n\nThe \"big technology companies who build them,\" the president said, \"must pay their own way.\"\n\nTrump wrote that his administration had collaborated with Microsoft on the company's pledge to cover its electricity costs, and alluded to future announcements by other companies.\n\nWhen asked for further comment, the White House Press Office pointed to President Trump's post on Truth Social.\n\nMicrosoft's four-part plan to ensure it is paying its fair share of electricity costs was laid out in a blog post this week. The plan consists of asking utilities and regulators to set their rates high enough to cover their data center costs, collaborating with utilities to cover the costs of new infrastructure, looking for ways to operate data centers more efficiently, and advocating for affordable, reliable power at the state and federal levels.\n\nWhen asked for further comment, a spokesperson for Microsoft pointed to the company's blog post.\n\nConsumer advocates are cautiously optimistic about Microsoft's promise to pay its fair share, but eager to see more details — especially from the utilities that serve the data centers.\n\n\"These are only rough concepts that don't get at the root of the problem, which is the scale and speed at which the industry is moving,\" said Julie Bolthouse, director of land use at Virginia's Piedmont Environmental Council.\n\nDominion Energy, Virginia's largest public utility, has said it is in contract talks with data center customers for 47 gigawatts of new demand — double Dominion's current peak load.\n\nBolthouse is concerned about the legitimacy of that demand — and who might end up footing the bill if it never comes to fruition.\n\n\"The current process of unreviewed contracts between utilities and data centers has broken the planning process and threatens the reliability of the system,\" said Bolthouse.\n\nCharles Hua, founder and director of Powerlines, a nonprofit that advocates for utility regulation reform, said that data centers can be \"good grid citizens\" if local utilities prioritize investment in grid-enhancing technologies and energy efficiency over building new power plants.\n\n\"Doing so will require states to reimagine our outdated system of utility regulation and make necessary changes to center consumers going forward,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan on Wednesday urged the U.S. and Europe to help secure the transport of oil following drone attacks ​on tankers heading to a Black Sea terminal on the ‌Russian coast which handles one percent of global supply.\n\nUnidentified drones struck at least two oil tankers ‌in the Black Sea on Tuesday, including one chartered by U.S. oil major Chevron, as they sailed toward a terminal on the Russian coast to load oil from Kazakhstan.\n\nKazakhstan's foreign ministry said in a statement that three tankers were ⁠hit en route to ‌the marine terminal of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) in the Black Sea.\n\nOn November 29, drones also attacked CPC's exporting equipment, ‍resulting in a fall in oil exports via the outlet.\n\n\"The increasing frequency of such incidents highlights the growing risks to the functioning of international energy infrastructure,\" the ministry ​said in a statement.\n\n\"We therefore call upon our partners to engage ‌in close cooperation to develop joint measures aimed at preventing similar incidents in the future,\" it added.\n\nRussian defence ministry said on Wednesday that the Matilda tanker, sailing under the Maltese flag, came under attack by two Ukrainian strike drones at a distance of about 100 kilometres (62 miles) from the city of ⁠Anapa in Russia's Krasnodar region.\n\nUkraine did not ​comment on the incident.\n\nShareholders in CPC's 1,500-km (930-mile) ​pipeline include Kazakhstan's state-owned oil company KazMunayGas, Russia's Lukoil and units of U.S. oil giants Chevron and ExxonMobil.\n\nRussian terminals on the ‍Black Sea handle ⁠more than 2% of global crude. Its waters, which are shared by Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania and Turkey, as well as Russia and Ukraine, ⁠are also crucial for the shipment of grain.\n\nCPC alone accounts for around 80% of oil ‌exports from Kazakhstan.",

    "fullText": "Global oil prices surged on Tuesday as markets reacted to the escalating drone strikes at the Novorossiysk terminal, which handles roughly 2% of the world's daily supply. The disruption to the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) infrastructure, a vital artery for Kazakh exports managed by Western majors like Chevron and Shell, raised immediate fears of a prolonged supply squeeze.\n\nWhile Brent was trading at $65.13, up 1.9%.\n\nTwo oil tankers waiting to load crude from some of Kazakhstan’s biggest oilfields were hit by drones at the marine terminal of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) near Novorossiysk on Russia’s Black Sea coast, sources told Reuters.\n\nThe Caspian Pipeline Consortium Marine Terminal, a major oil export facility close to Novorossiysk, handles most of Kazakhstan’s crude oil exports, as well as some Russian crude supply.\n\nThe Delta Harmony and the Matilda tankers were waiting to load crude from Tengizchevroil and Karachaganak, respectively, according to Reuters’ sources.\n\nTengizchevroil, operating the supergiant Tengiz oilfield in Kazakhstan, is managed by a consortium led by U.S. oil and gas supermajor Chevron. Karachaganak, another giant field in Kazakhstan, is operated by a consortium comprising Shell, Chevron, and Italy’s Eni, among others.\n\nDrone attacks at or near the CPC terminal have intensified in recent weeks and have affected the loading and departure schedules of Kazakhstan’s crude cargoes.\n\nKazakhstan’s oil output fell sharply at the end of November and early December after damage at the CPC export terminal disrupted flows. Output dropped in the first two days of December after storms and structural damage limited loading capacity at the Black Sea terminal, prompting producers to scale back throughput as storage filled.\n\nKazakhstan relies on the CPC for roughly 80% of its crude exports.\n\nThe disruption came at a sensitive moment for Kazakhstan, which was attempting to stabilize production following repeated CPC interruptions earlier in 2025.\n\nOil has continued to flow, but at lower rates, while Kazakhstan sought to re-route some exports away from the Black Sea to keep supply relatively steady.\n\nCPC operates the pipeline from the Caspian coast in northwest Kazakhstan to the Novorossiysk port, which handles 80% of Kazakhstan’s crude exports from giant oilfields operated by international oil firms.\n\nAffiliates of Chevron and ExxonMobil are also minority shareholders in CPC, with the Russian Federation as its largest shareholder with a 24% stake.",

    "fullText": "A Russian captain killed a crewman in an “entirely avoidable” collision with a US oil tanker in the North Sea, a court heard.\n\nCapt Vladimir Motin, 59, was on sole watch duty when his container ship collided into the Stena Immaculate, causing the death of Mark Angelo Pernia on March 10 last year.\n\nPernia had allegedly been working at the front of the Solong and died in the collision.\n\nOpening his Old Bailey trial on Tuesday, Tom Little KC, prosecuting, said the case involved the “entirely avoidable death” of the 38-year-old seaman Pernia.\n\nHe told jurors that the location of the Stena Immaculate would have been visible on the Solong’s radar display about 36 minutes before the vessels collided.\n\nMr Little said: “Despite an obvious collision course, the defendant did not deviate his vessel from its path and the impending catastrophe that lay ahead.\n\n“The defendant was responsible for navigating the ship, not only because he was the captain but because he was on sole watch duty at the time and ultimately, he did nothing, absolutely nothing, to avoid the collision.”\n\nMr Motin, from Primorsky, St Petersburg, is accused of manslaughter, Mr Little telling jurors that Pernia “would still be alive” if not for the Russian’s “grossly negligent” conduct.\n\nSolong, which was 130 metres long and weighed 7,852 gross tonnes, had departed Grangemouth in Scotland at 9.05pm on March 9 last year, bound for the port of Rotterdam.\n\nThe vessel, with a 14-strong crew, was carrying mainly alcoholic spirits and some hazardous substances, including empty but unclean sodium cyanide containers, the court was told.\n\nThe Stena Immaculate, with a crew of 23, was 183.2 metres long and was transporting more than 220,000 barrels of aviation fuel destined for the US military.\n\nIts engine was shut down on the evening of March 9. Restarting it would have taken about 30 to 45 minutes and about 35 minutes to manoeuvre away from an incoming ship, the court heard.\n\nThe two vessels crashed at about 9.47am on March 10, just over 12 hours after the Solong set off from Grangemouth.\n\nThe Solong had been travelling at just over 16 knots in the minutes before the collision and was going 15.2 knots on impact with no warning to the Stena Immaculate.\n\nPernia’s body has never been found.\n\nThe Solong was on a direct collision course for much longer than a matter of minutes, jurors were told.\n\nThe collision course was obvious when the tanker became visible to the naked eye and, before that, on computer equipment available to the defendant, Mr Little argued.\n\nMr Motin had a “constellation of information” telling him he needed to act but did the opposite and failed to avert the collision, the court heard.\n\nThere were a number of things the “highly trained” captain “could and should have done”, Mr Little said.\n\n“It is this gross breach of duty to the man he killed, and indeed to his own crew, that led inexorably to a death and to him being on trial before you at the Old Bailey,” the prosecutor said.\n\nMr Motin has denied manslaughter and the trial continues.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "LONDON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Global oil trading houses have emerged as early winners in the race to control Venezuelan crude flows, getting ahead of U.S. energy majors wary of credit and legal risks and securing a potentially lucrative business opportunity in the country with the world's largest crude reserves.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said U.S. majors would invest billions of dollars in Venezuela to quickly rebuild its dilapidated oil sector following the U.S. ​capture of President Nicolas Maduro earlier in January. Trump met top oil executives at the White House on Friday as his administration outlines a long-term plan to raise $100 billion to boost Venezuelan oil output.\n\nThe first companies to secure any business in the wake ‌of the U.S. military action in Caracas, however, were Dutch-based trader Vitol and Singapore-headquartered peer Trafigura, rather than U.S. majors.\n\nThe U.S. government tapped the giant merchant houses because they were better suited to quickly get Venezuelan oil exports flowing again, four industry sources familiar with the negotiations said. That is the first order of business for Washington before reconstruction ‌can begin, so that revenue from exports under U.S. supervision can fund the government of interim President Delcy Rodriguez in Caracas.\n\n\"Securing and marketing the initial barrels of Venezuelan crude oil was done at record speed to benefit both the American and Venezuelan people,\" a White House official told Reuters.\n\nVenezuela relies on oil exports for revenue, and has been starved of those proceeds for about a month under a blockade Trump imposed as he raised pressure on Maduro.\n\nWashington and Caracas are finalizing a $2 billion deal to sell up to 50 million barrels of crude to U.S. refiners and other buyers - oil that had been stuck on ships in Venezuelan waters and in storage tanks because of the blockade.\n\nFacilitating the initial oil sales was critical to ensure funds could flow back into Venezuela for everyday services and a process is in place to maintain the steady flow of production, sales, and refining of Venezuelan crude oil, the ⁠White House official said.\n\nTrafigura and Vitol have secured preliminary special licenses to negotiate and export the ‌Venezuelan crude, and Trafigura is set to load its first cargo this week, Chief Executive Richard Holtum said at the White House meeting with Trump.\n\nGLOBAL NETWORK ADDED TO TRADERS' APPEAL\n\nThe trading houses competed with Chevron to secure the supply deals. Chevron is the only U.S. oil major that operates in Venezuela, as a minority partner in joint ventures with Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA. Chevron has a license from U.S. authorities, which exempts it from ‍the sanctions the United States had imposed to choke off oil revenues to Maduro.",

    "description": "A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nThe grants supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, including battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and efforts to capture carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nThe Energy Department said the projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Russell Vought, the White House budget director, said on social media that “the Left’s climate agenda is being canceled.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said the administration’s action violated the Constitution’s equal protection requirements.\n\n“Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024,” Mehta wrote in a 17-page opinion. The administration offered no explanation for how their purposeful targeting of grant recipients based on their electoral support for Trump — or lack of it — “rationally advances their stated government interest,” the judge added.\n\nThe ruling was the second legal setback for the administration’s rollback of clean energy program in a matter of hours. A separate federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as Trump seeks to shut it down.\n\nA spokesman for the Energy Department said officials disagree with the judge’s decision on clean energy grants.\n\nOfficials “stand by our review process, which evaluated these awards individually and determined they did not meet the standards necessary to justify the continued spending of taxpayer dollars,” spokesman Ben Dietderich said. “The American people deserve a government that is accountable and responsible in managing taxpayer funds.”\n\nProjects were canceled in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state. All 16 targeted states supported Harris.\n\nThe cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.\n\nThe city of St. Paul and a coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit after they lost grants.\n\nTrump said in an interview last fall with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects that Democrats want. “I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said in the Oct. 1 interview.\n\nVickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the groups that filed the suit, said the court ruling “recognized that the Trump Department of Energy vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration, in violation of the bedrock Constitutional guarantee that all people in all states have equal protection under the law.”\n\nThe administration’s actions violated the Constitution, foundational American values and “imposed high costs on the American people who rely on clean affordable energy for their pocketbooks and for healthier lives,” Patton said.\n\nAnne Evens, CEO of Elevate Energy, one of the groups that lost funding, said the court ruling would help keep clean energy affordable and create jobs.\n\n“Affordable energy should be a reality for everyone, and the restoration of these grants is an important step toward making that possible,” she said.",

    "description": "Lower Chinese LNG demand could pressure global markets, especially as new U.S. and Qatari capacity comes online and Russian pipeline and LNG exports to China increase.",
    "fullText": "China is boosting domestic natural gas production, and it is doing it fast. A major LNG consumer—and importer—the country has been key in LNG demand forecasts. Now, these forecasts will need to be revised.\n\nLess than ten years ago, China was struggling to get its domestic gas production off the ground, especially in shale formations. China’s shale geology is different from the U.S. basins, and energy companies were finding it difficult to get commercial production going. Now, China’s state oil and gas majors are pumping more gas than ever and announcing new discoveries in the shale patch.\n\nIn November last year, China produced 22.1 billion cu m, which was a 7.1% increase on the year, Kpler reported this month citing official production data. The increase was driven by “faster-than-expected shale gas ramp-ups in the Sichuan Basin.” Based on that data, the energy analytics firm expects China’s total for 2025 to reach 263 billion cu m, rising to 278.5 billion cu m this year, again thanks to growing shale gas production in the Sichuan and Shanxi basins.\n\nAs with oil, rising domestic production would inevitably affect imports, even as China leans more heavily on natural gas for emission-reduction purposes. Last year, for instance, China booked higher domestic gas production and a rather substantial decline in LNG imports. In fact, imports of liquefied gas last year fell to the lowest in six years after a string of 12 monthly declines in a row. Imports only rebounded at the end of the year but not enough to reverse the decline. Kpler has predicted that Chinese demand for liquefied natural gas is going to decline this year as well, with shale gas production removing some 600,000 tons of LNG demand, reducing the total to 73.9 million tons.\n\nNow, 600,000 tons is not a whole lot in the context of a market where the United States alone exported over 100 million tons last year. But it does serve as yet another evidence of a trend in China to reduce dependence on energy imports, which has implications for global energy commodity markets that have gotten used to relying on China as the ultimate driver of demand.\n\nThe projected decline in China’s demand for gas—and by extension LNG—may interfere with new LNG capacity addition plans and prices, shrinking producers’ profits. It is these plans for a wave of new LNG supply, set to come online by the end of the decade, mostly from the top exporters, the United States and Qatar, that have prompted many analysts to expect an oversupplied LNG market by 2030 that would weigh on prices.",

Could a video game teach me anything new about suffering?\nLast year I became uncomfortably well acquainted with suffering.

    "fullText": "When Hollow Knight: Silksong came out last summer I was in so much pain that I didn’t know if I’d be able to play it. Could a video game teach me anything new about suffering?\n\nLast year I became uncomfortably well acquainted with suffering. In March I started experiencing excruciating pain in my right arm and shoulder – burning, zapping, energy-sapping pain that left me unable to think straight, emanating from a nexus of torment behind my shoulder blade and sometimes stretching all the way up to the base of my skull and all the way down into my fingers. Typing was agony, but everything was painful; even at rest it was horrible. I couldn’t play my guitar; I couldn’t play video games; I couldn’t sleep. I learned how quickly physical suffering lacerates your mental wellbeing.\n\nI’d had episodes of nagging pain from so-called repetitive strain injuries before, the product of long hours hunched over laptops and game controllers over the course of decades, but nothing like this. A few months later, after the initial unrelenting agony had subsided to a permanent hum of more moderate pain, it was diagnosed as brachial neuritis, inflammation of the nerve path that travels from the base of your neck down to your hand. (Nobody knows what causes it, but it sometimes happens after an infection or an injury.) The good news, I was told by a neurologist, was that it usually gets better in about one to three years, and I hadn’t lost any function in my right hand. The bad news was that there was nothing much to be done about the pain in the meantime.\n\nTraditional pain meds don’t really do much for nerve pain. And after trying out the small range of nerve pain medications – pills that act on the brain, where pain really lives – I discovered that they all sent me loopy in ways I would rather not ever experience again. So I had to figure out how to live with it. My nerves were upset; they had now learned the pain. It would take time to unlearn it.\n\nIn August, meanwhile, a small Australian developer called Team Cherry announced a release date for a game that had been in the works for many years. Silksong was the follow-up to Hollow Knight, a title I had loved when it came out in 2017: an atmospheric and enticingly challenging game about fighting your way through a corrupted underground bug kingdom. Silksong was so hotly anticipated that it became a meme; its name appeared in the comments under every gaming showcase for over half a decade, while Team Cherry remained resolutely silent about when it was coming out. Posters on Reddit started mock-ritually-sacrificing each other in an effort to manifest its release. Now it was finally coming out, and I was in so much pain that I didn’t know if I’d be able to play it.\n\nThere is an underlying narrative of overcoming the odds – of suffering and redemption – in almost all video games, but especially the difficult ones. And I love the difficult ones. Video games imbue suffering with meaning: you try and fail, try and fail, until you succeed. Perhaps, I thought, playing Silksong during a period of real-life suffering and disability might help me look at it differently.\n\nSilksong has the appearance of a very beautiful nightmare, and the energy of a horror-tinged European animated TV show you only half-remember from your childhood. Its player character, Hornet, is a masked spider in a red cloak; the other characters are oddly cute but dead-eyed bug creatures, hunched over with their own suffering. Beginning at the foot of the kingdom of Pharloom, you travel through moss-furred, luminescent caverns, moonlit temples, wind and sand-blasted wastelands, tight winding tunnels whose walls are made of cogs or tarnished bells, up towards the once gleaming Citadel at the top. Bugs have been making pilgrimages to the Citadel for untold generations but they rarely survive the journey. There is precious little life anywhere, and what there is will try to kill you. Something has poisoned their minds.\n\nThe journey mirrors Dante’s in The Divine Comedy from hell through purgatory to heaven, from cursed depths to the home of god. The piteous outpost where Hornet begins the game is little more than a shanty town; rag-clad bugs huddled in a place of temporary safety. The populace of Pharloom accepts their fate, cowering in every settlement with blank stares and sorrowful posture: this is how things are meant to be. Like any pilgrimage, the way to the Citadel involves enormous hardship before you come close to divinity. I was told this over and over by the bugs I met in between my battles with the feral beasts and corrupted priests that stood in my way – battles that often sent me back to a checkpoint, fuming, 10 or 20 or 50 times before I finally defeated them.\n\nExcept Silksong’s supposed heaven is hellish in itself. Once you get there, up to the Citadel – past the fog-wreathed swamp guarded by the vicious, flapping Moorwing, past the silk-wreathed Widow that holds the gilded town of Bellhart in a frightening state of suspended animation, past the Last Judge who guards the grand gate, swinging a flaming thurible that can end you in seconds with waves and columns of sweeping fire – you find that it has fallen, too. There is no point to the suffering of the pilgrims who come here. If they survive, there is only more suffering ahead. The highest places turn out to be some of the worst.\n\nThe Citadel is barely the halfway point of the game, however. Past that gate, Pharloom branches in all directions. Deep, deep below, there is a roiling furnace; in Sinners Road you find where the prisoners of the realm have been left to rot; there is an abandoned hospital, a pitiless wind-whipped mountain of ice, a museum of sorts that takes you through the realm in miniature (why is it there?). The guardians of these places become ever more punishing. I nearly lost my mind fighting Trobbio, the dancer, the flamboyant performer, trapped for ever on his stage, theatrically intoning his own name as he destroys me with pyrotechnics.\n\nHornet gleams silk-bright in this dismal world. Within her is the substance that holds Pharloom’s minds in thrall, the godly silk. She whips her divine power around herself like ribbons, to heal the damage done to her. She speaks with clarity and compassion, to bugs that respond in riddles or threats, half-mad. She plucks melodies on a stringed instrument that make the bugs around her turn their faces upwards and sing in disconnected couplets. And she fights: with her sharp-pointed needle, with bone-crafted boomerangs and plant-poison and flea-brew, with sharp tacks and javelin-spears and anything else she can find in Pharloom. She fights and fights, and yet beyond each battle waits another.\n\nHampered by pain, I am forced to explore all of this very, very slowly. It takes me months to make my way painstakingly through a game I would have rinsed in three weeks in my previous life. My pilgrimage cannot be rushed. A lot of managing pain involves cultivating a state of safety for your nervous system, minimising stress as much as possible, and it turns out that difficult video games are very stressful. The frustration of failure causes my hands to grip the controller too hard and my fingers begin to hurt. The adrenaline of victory sends me into a state of exhilarated fight-or-flight that my nerves can’t currently handle. Instead of disappearing into Silksong like I have with other games since I was a teenager, I play for 20, 40 minutes at a time, over months.\n\nUnexpectedly, this makes Pharloom begin to feel like a parallel dimension, somewhere I can slip into not just on my Nintendo Switch but in my mind. I have to stop playing when pain starts to travel to my hand, so I keep playing it in my head.\n\nI see the Cogwork Dancers, the balletic mechanical twin bosses at the very top of the Citadel, flitting in front of my mind’s eye in their predictable attack patterns. I think about the shaft I found in a corner of the Blasted Steps and wonder whether I can get up there with the piton-like tool that Hornet recently acquired. I think, all the time, about what happened in Pharloom; the clawed grip of religion on the minds of its populace, who cling to their rosary beads even as they lose their grasp on their own minds. I think about the tall princeling I rescued from a cell, crouched over the remains of one of the Cogwork Dancers: his partner, long ago.\n\nYou can tell that this game is a work of obsession. The detail everywhere is extraordinary, even in the writhing maggots that carpet the ground in the aptly named Putrified Ducts. But also, where in most game worlds everything feels oriented towards the player – fun playgrounds laid out for your enjoyment, a daub of yellow paint here and there to show you where to go – Hornet’s presence, my presence, feels almost incidental to Pharloom. It rots away without me, bugs chanting their devotions, patrolling silk-poisoned clerics clanging their bells. I come upon a settlement and am not welcomed as a saviour, but regarded through a veil of suspicion and despair.\n\nIndeed, some places in Pharloom aren’t fun at all. They’re places I never want to see again. Late one night I find myself in Bilewater, a fetid parkour course over more pools of writhing maggots and past bile-spitting moss-monsters. I am here to find Shakra the warrior-cartographer, whose haunting song has guided me towards her throughout Pharloom, scrabbling for rosaries to pay for her maps. Her trail is marked with bronze rings, a detail I can’t believe I didn’t notice earlier in the game, but it takes me days of spaced-out play to make the journey from the nearest safe bench to the tranquil pool where she rests. Trickster creatures follow me, setting tripwires and traps that make it even harder to avoid the gaping mouths, slashing teeth and erratic movements of the native creatures here. It brought me to the verge of tears.\n\nGiving up never felt like an option. I’ve taken breaks from Silksong – a week or two at a time – but I have not given up, not even when I got stuck in an almost-impossible gauntlet involving waves of aggressive crows. Silksong feels like a sadistic game at times, needlessly punishing: take a hit and it’ll often wipe not one but two precious units of Hornet’s health. I’m not sure why I didn’t quit. It wasn’t pure obstinacy. I think that because I was suffering all of the time anyway, adding a bit more suffering into my days by choice at least gave me a feeling of control.\n\nDifficult video games require tenacity and resilience. Keep throwing yourself at the problem unrelentingly until you defeat it, they teach you. There’s nothing you can’t do with enough skill and determination. You can always win. You just have to try hard enough.\n\nThis does not apply to pain. No amount of effort will persuade nerves to heal any faster, and pain is not something that can be overcome with sheer determination. I’ve carried plenty of strategies from video games into my real life before: I have applied the same bullheaded tenacity to learning languages, writing books, supporting and caring for my friends and family. But nothing I’ve ever learned from video games has helped me deal with pain. Instead I’ve had to learn how to do things more slowly, stay within my capacity, and admit my limitations without guilt or self-admonishment.\n\nI did not know that I could do things slowly. I didn’t know that I would be able to play Silksong slowly. But I have learned how. As I have been playing through this game I have also been reading endlessly about modern pain science. At first I was doing this rather desperately, in search of a way out, a way to speed things up, to get myself out of suffering. What I learned instead is that acknowledging pain is the first step to learning to live with it, and that learning to live with it is what it actually means to overcome it. Pain is the brain’s danger signal: if you ignore it, it only gets louder. If you start listening instead, observing and acquiescing, your brain might put away the megaphone. I have learned that acknowledging pain and modifying your life around it does not mean giving up. It means you get to keep on living – keep on playing.\n\nAfter four months and 40 hours, I have done almost everything there is to do in Pharloom. I am fighting the very final boss, and I have been trying to defeat her since before Christmas. I hoped I might finish this game before the end of 2025, a neat little piece of symbolism to represent perseverance through an extremely challenging year. It hasn’t worked out quite so elegantly, but Silksong has helped me look at suffering a little differently. There doesn’t need to be a point to it; it doesn’t necessarily come with a tidy narrative of perseverance and eventual redemption. But you can learn to work around it. You can make your way through.\n\nSuper Nintendo: How One Japanese Company Helped the World Have Fun by Keza MacDonald is out 12 February (Guardian Faber Publishing, £20).

    "description": "Venezuela is home to the world’s largest reported oil reserves. The country’s other commodities have also caught the Trump administration’s attention.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump says US companies will now have access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves. But the country’s other commodities have also caught his administration’s attention.\n\nVenezuela has unverified amounts of minerals, metals and potentially rare earth elements, experts say. These raw materials are indispensable for industries from defense to technology, and the administration has repeatedly stressed their importance for US national security.\n\nBut while Washington might aspire to secure Venezuela’s critical elements, it’s a tall order, experts say, and wouldn’t do much to bolster America’s supply chain.\n\nThe quantity and economic viability of Venezuela’s mineral resources are uncertain. Companies also face major risks mining in Venezuela without sustained security guarantees.\n\nMany of these regions have guerrilla soldiers and armed groups engaging in illegal gold mining, experts say. Energy-intensive rare earths mining can also harm the environment.\n\n“There is an awareness within the administration that even beyond oil, there’s wider natural resource value in the country,” said Reed Blakemore, director of research at the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center.\n\n“However, if we’re talking about the conditions under which we are able to exploit those mineral resources and bring them to market, it’s a much more challenging story,” Blakemore said. “And even, frankly, more challenging than the oil story.”\n\nEven if US companies were to try to mine Venezuela’s rare earths, getting them out of the ground is just one part of the process. Those materials are usually sent to China for refining.\n\nChina accounted for over 90% of global rare earths refining in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency. The country maintains a virtual monopoly in processing and refining the materials due to decades of government subsidies, industry expansion and lax environmental regulations.\n\nRare earths have become a major sticking point in US-China trade tensions. Beijing last year implemented some export controls on rare earths during trade spats, raising concerns about America’s lack of secure supply chains for these critical materials.\n\n“China still holds near-singular capacity to process rare earth metals, and that industrial and geopolitical edge cannot be overcome overnight,” said Joel Dodge, director of industrial policy and economic security at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator.\n\nThe US Geological Survey designates 60 “critical minerals” vital to economic and national security.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Sunday delivered a warning to Cuba, advising Havana to strike a deal \"before it is too late.\"\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump said the island nation would no longer receive oil or money from Venezuela.\n\n\"Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela,\" Trump wrote. \"In return, Cuba provided 'Security Services' for the last two Venezuelan dictators, BUT NOT ANYMORE!\"\n\n\"THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO!\" he continued. \"I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.\"\n\nTrump turned his attention to Venezuela's oil industry after the US captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in Caracas last week. Maduro has been indicted in the Southern District of New York on weapons and drug charges.\n\nOn Friday, American oil executives met with Trump and senior administration officials to discuss a proposed $100 billion plan to invest in Venezuela's oil operations.\n\nTrump earlier said the government may reimburse oil companies for growing their operations in Venezuela. The Big Oil executives at the meeting, for their part, appeared largely hesitant to reenter the volatile country before major reforms are made.\n\nFor Cuba, losing access to Venezuelan oil would be a big blow to its already uncertain economy. According to the US Energy Information Administration, Cuba imports the majority of its oil from Venezuela — about 30,000 to 35,000 barrels a day, per most estimates.\n\nSpeaking to reporters last week on board Air Force One, Trump said Cuba appeared \"ready to fall.\"\n\n\"I don't know if they're going to hold out,\" he said. \"But Cuba now has no income. They got all of their income from Venezuela, from the Venezuelan oil.\"\n\nAsked whether the US would take military action in Cuba, Trump said he did not think it would be necessary, adding: \"I think it's just going to fall.\"\n\nIn his post on Truth Social, Trump also positioned the US as Venezuela's protector moving forward, saying that most of the Cuban security personnel stationed in Caracas had been killed in the operation to seize Maduro.\n\nThe Cuban government announced that 32 of its nationals died during the US raid on the capital.",

    "description": "Hundreds of miles above the Arctic Circle, an American oil company is attempting to extract billions of barrels of oil on Greenland, just as Trump is escalating tensions with the territory.",
    "fullText": "TASIILAQ, GREENLAND — Oil executives looking for the next massive source of petroleum have turned toward the Arctic for decades. Studies by the US government suggest the area above the Arctic Circle could hold as many as 90 billion barrels of oil and nearly 1,700 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.\n\nThe oil alone would be enough to sustain the entirety of global demand for nearly three years if all other drilling worldwide were to cease tomorrow.\n\nAt the center of these ambitions is Greenland, where some of the harshest conditions on Earth protect stores that have drawn in prospectors looking for the chance at another discovery the size of Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay.\n\nA company called March GL, which will be renamed Greenland Energy Company after it goes public this year, is hoping to vault itself into the upper echelons of the industry by extracting some of these billions of barrels of oil from a peninsula called Jameson Land sticking off the eastern coast of Greenland, the largest island in the world. The oil could be transformative for the US and European markets likely to receive it, injecting a massive wave of new supply that could help wean Europe from its dependence on Russian petroleum, currently under a steep sanctions regime as its war in Ukraine rages on.\n\nIn late October, Yahoo Finance accompanied March GL CEO and veteran oilman Robert Price, alongside the company’s lead petroleum engineer, to a town called Tasiilaq on Greenland’s eastern coast, where March GL’s contractors were preparing to store a collection of heavy machinery in town for the winter.\n\nPrice had been planning to barge the earthmovers up to Jameson Land, where they would begin constructing a three-mile-long road from the coast to the inland site where March GL will be drilling its first wells. Rough seas off the island’s eastern coast left the tugboat with which the company planned to haul the equipment unable to make the journey; by late autumn, the window of ice-free water to make this trip was closing too quickly to wait for a new one.\n\nInstead, March GL’s team will keep much of its equipment in Tasiilaq until the spring or summer, when the ice will thaw, compressing their timelines — a testament to the tenuous-at-best operating conditions in Greenland.\n\nSince that trip, the complexities of Price’s Greenland ambitions have only increased.\n\nAfter the arrest and extraction of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in early January, President Trump renewed his push to annex the Danish autonomous territory. Trump said during a press briefing on Jan. 4 that “we need Greenland” to protect US national security interests in the Arctic, comments which set off a wave of pushback from the Greenlandic and Danish governments.",

    "description": "U.S.",
    "fullText": "HAVANA/HOUSTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday said no more Venezuelan oil or money will go to Cuba and suggested the Communist-run island should strike a deal with Washington, ramping up pressure on the long-time U.S. nemesis and provoking defiant words from the island's leadership.\n\nVenezuela is ​Cuba's biggest oil supplier, but no cargoes have departed from Venezuelan ports to the Caribbean country since the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by U.S. forces ‌in early January amid a strict U.S. oil blockade on the OPEC country, shipping data shows.\n\nMeanwhile, Caracas and Washington are progressing on a $2 billion deal to supply up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil to the U.S. with ‌proceeds to be deposited in U.S. Treasury-supervised accounts, a major test of the emerging relationship between Trump and interim President Delcy Rodriguez.\n\n\"THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO! I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sunday.\n\n\"Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela,\" Trump added.\n\nCuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel rejected Trump's threat on social media, suggesting the U.S. had no moral authority to force a deal on Cuba.\n\n\"Cuba is a free, independent, and sovereign nation. Nobody dictates what ⁠we do,\" Diaz-Canel said on X. \"Cuba does not attack; it has ‌been attacked by the U.S. for 66 years, and it does not threaten; it prepares, ready to defend the homeland to the last drop of blood.\"\n\nThe U.S. president did not elaborate on his suggested deal.\n\nBut Trump's push on Cuba represents the latest escalation in his move to bring regional ‍powers in line with the United States and underscores the seriousness of the administration's ambition to dominate the Western Hemisphere.\n\nTrump's top officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have made no secret of their expectation that the recent U.S. intervention in Venezuela could push Cuba over the edge.\n\nU.S. officials have hardened their rhetoric against Cuba in recent weeks, though the two countries have been at odds since former leader Fidel Castro's ​1959 revolution.\n\nCuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said in another post on X on Sunday that Cuba had the right to import fuel from any suppliers willing to ‌export it. He also denied that Cuba had received financial or other \"material\" compensation in return for security services provided to any country.\n\nThirty-two members of Cuba's armed forces and intelligence services were killed during the U.S. raid on Venezuela. Cuba said those killed were responsible for \"security and defense\" but did not provide details on the arrangement between the two long-time allies.\n\nCuba relies on imported crude and fuel mainly provided by Venezuela, and Mexico in smaller volumes, purchased on the open market to keep its power generators and vehicles running.\n\nAs its operational refining capacity dwindled in recent years, Venezuela's supply of crude and fuel to Cuba has fallen. But the South American country is still the largest provider with some 26,500 barrels per day exported last year, according to ship ⁠tracking data and internal documents of state-run PDVSA, which covered roughly 50% of Cuba's oil deficit.\n\nEven before Maduro's ​capture, Cuba had been struggling to keep the lights on. Vast swaths of the island live without electricity for ​much of the day, and even the capital Havana has seen its economy crippled by hours-long rolling blackouts.\n\nShortages of food, fuel and medicine have put Cubans on edge and have prompted a record-breaking exodus, primarily to the United States, in the past five years.\n\nMexico has emerged in recent ‍weeks as a critical alternative oil supplier to ⁠the island, but the supply remains small, according to the shipping data.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum last week said her country had not increased supply volumes, but given recent political events in Venezuela, Mexico had turned into an \"important supplier\" of crude to Cuba.\n\nU.S. intelligence has painted a grim picture of Cuba's economic and political situation, but its assessments offer ⁠no clear support for Trump's prediction that the island is \"ready to fall,\" Reuters reported on Saturday, citing three people familiar with the confidential assessments.\n\nThe CIA's view is that key sectors of the Cuban economy, such as agriculture and ‌tourism, are severely strained by frequent blackouts, trade sanctions and other problems. The potential loss of oil imports and other support from Venezuela could make governing ‌more difficult for Diaz-Canel.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Ukrainian drone strike sparked a fire at an oil depot in Russia’s southern Volgograd region, officials said Saturday, after Russia launched a powerful hypersonic missile along with drones and other weapons that disrupted Kyiv's power supply and heating.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of casualties, Volgograd Gov. Andrei Bocharov was quoted as saying in a Telegram post published on the channel of the local administration. The post did not specify the damage, but said that people living near the depot may have to be evacuated.\n\nUkraine’s General Staff said Saturday it had struck the Zhutovskaya oil depot overnight. In a statement on Telegram, it said the depot is supplying fuel to Russian forces, adding that damage was being assessed.\n\nUkraine’s long-range drone strikes on Russian energy sites aim to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue its full-scale invasion. Russia wants to cripple the Ukrainian power grid, seeking to deny civilians access to heat, light and running water in what Kyiv officials say is an attempt to “weaponize winter.”\n\nSaturday's attack came the day after Russia bombarded Ukraine with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles overnight into Friday, according to Ukrainian officials, killing at least four people in the capital. For only the second time in the nearly 4-year-old war, it used a powerful new hypersonic missile that struck western Ukraine in a clear warning to Kyiv’s NATO allies.\n\nThe intense barrage and the launch of the nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile followed reports of major progress in talks between Ukraine and its allies on how to defend the country from further Moscow aggression if a U.S.-led peace deal is struck.\n\nStéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, said Friday's attacks “have resulted in significant civilian casualties and deprived millions of Ukrainians of essential services, including electricity, heating and water at a time of acute humanitarian need.”\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said heat supply would be fully restored in Kyiv by the end of Saturday.\n\nShe said areas on the right bank of the Dnieper River would gradually lift emergency blackouts and return to scheduled outages. But resuming power supply on the left bank, where Russian attacks were concentrated, is more complicated due to significant damage to the power grid, she added.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said Saturday that its forces used aviation, drones, missiles and artillery to strike Ukrainian energy facilities and fuel-storage depots.\n\nRussia struck Ukraine with 121 drones and one Iskander-M ballistic missile, according to the Ukrainian air force. It said 94 drones were shot down.\n\nSeparately, the Russian Defense Ministry said 59 Ukrainian drones were neutralized overnight over Russia and occupied Crimea.\n\nUkraine's military said that besides the oil depot in Volgograd, it had struck a drone storage facility belonging to a unit of Russia’s 19th Motor Rifle Division in Zaporizhzhia, southern Ukraine, as well as a drone command and control point near the eastern city of Pokrovsk.\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "Global ocean warming continued unabated in 2025 in response to increased greenhouse gas concentrations and recent reductions in sulfate aerosols, reflecting the long-term accumulation of heat within the climate system, with conditions evolving toward La Niña during the year. In 2025, global upper 2000 m ocean heat content (OHC) increased by ∼23 ± 8 ZJ relative to 2024 according to IAP/CAS estimates. CIGAR-RT, and Copernicus Marine data confirm the continued ocean heat gain. Regionally, about 33% of the global ocean area ranked among its historical (1958–2025) top three warmest conditions, while about 57% fell within the top five, including the tropical and South Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, North Indian Ocean, and Southern Oceans, underscoring the broad ocean warming across basins. Multiple datasets consistently indicate ocean warming, as measured by 0–2000 m OHC, increased from 0.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's $100 billion plan to invest in Venezuela's oil industry was met with a muted response from US energy executives on Friday.\n\nWhile the promise to revive Venezuela's oil industry drew praise from many in attendance at the White House meeting, no concrete pledges were made, and Exxon CEO Darren Woods went as far as to describe the country as \"uninvestable\" at present.\n\n\"If we look at the legal and commercial constructs and frameworks in place today in Venezuela — today, it's uninvestable,\" Woods said.\n\n\"Significant changes have to be made to those commercial frameworks, the legal system,\" he continued. \"There has to be durable investment protections, and there has to be change to the hydrocarbon laws in the country.\"\n\nWoods said he was nevertheless \"confident\" the US could help bring about the necessary changes, adding that Exxon would look to send a technical team to Venezuela to assess the state of operations.\n\nTrump has been pushing for major US oil firms to pump money into Venezuelan energy infrastructure since the capture of Nicolás Maduro last week.\n\nTrump, who promised companies \"total safety and security\" to operate in Venezuela, previously said the US could reimburse oil companies for expanding their operations in the South American nation, which has the world's largest oil reserves.\n\nHarold Hamm, the founder of Continental Resources and a longtime Trump supporter, appeared to dodge a question on whether his firm would be entering the country, saying it presented \"challenges\" but that it excited him \"as an explorationist.\"\n\nTrump appeared unfazed by the notes of caution, but he reminded those present that he had \"25 people that aren't here today that are willing to take your place.\"\n\nMark Nelson, the vice chairman of Chevron — which partners with Venezuela's national oil company PDVSA on production projects in the country — sounded a more positive tone.\n\nNelson said Chevron was \"committed\" to the country and that it may increase production by around 50% over the next 18 to 24 months.\n\nThe oil industry had gathered with Trump and other senior figures from his administration to discuss how the US planned to move forward in Venezuela following the ouster of Maduro.\n\nThe US has said the raid on Caracas was a law enforcement operation and has indicted Maduro on drugs and weapons charges.",
