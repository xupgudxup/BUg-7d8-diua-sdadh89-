    "fullText": "Japan’s OHISAMA demonstration satellite is scheduled to be launched in fiscal 2026 on a mission that could revolutionize clean energy.\n\nAlthough earlier experiments have detected signals transmitted from orbit, the OHISAMA project aims to be the first in the world to deliver solar power to a receiving site on Earth and convert it into usable electricity.\n\nThe satellite will be carried aboard Space One Co.’s Kairos 5 small rocket.\n\nSpace-based solar power (SBSP) refers to the concept of placing large solar collectors in orbit that can convert sunlight into electricity onboard. That energy is transmitted wirelessly, typically by microwave or in some concepts by laser, to a receiving station on Earth.\n\nThe received energy is then converted back into electricity for distribution through the grid.\n\nSBSP remains an experimental technology and is positioned as a long-term research and development target under the Japanese government’s Basic Energy Plan.\n\nUnlike ground-based solar and wind power, SBSP is largely insulated from weather-related variables and the day-night cycle.\n\nIn addition, the ability to modulate transmission output and redirect power to different locations could make SBSP a flexible option during disasters and periods of fluctuating demand.\n\nA model proposed by Japan Space Systems (J-spacesystems), a nonprofit R&D foundation commissioned by the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry to develop the system, envisions an architecture featuring 2.5-kilometer-square solar arrays deployed in geostationary orbit about 36,000 kilometers above Earth.\n\nElectricity generated in orbit would be transmitted by microwave to a ground-based receiving antenna roughly 4 kilometers in diameter and then fed into the power grid.\n\nUnder this model, a single SBSP unit would generate about 1 gigawatt, an output described as sufficient to cover more than 10 percent of Tokyo’s annual electricity consumption.\n\nMICROWAVES BEAMED FROM 450 KM ABOVE\n\nAccording to J-spacesystems, the experiment will test whether power transmitted from space as microwaves can be efficiently converted back into electricity on the ground.\n\nThe OHISAMA satellite, weighing about 180 kg, carries an integrated power-generation and transmission panel measuring 70 cm by 2 meters.\n\nIts generating capacity is a modest 720 watts, but the mission aims to use energy received by a 64-meter parabolic antenna at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s (JAXA) Usuda Deep Space Center in Nagano Prefecture to light an LED.\n\nThe Usuda facility is used to track and communicate with deep-space spacecraft.\n\nFollowing a successful wireless power transmission test from an aircraft at an altitude of 7 km in 2024, the satellite mission will beam power from a 450-km orbit to assess how transmission distance, the ionosphere and the atmosphere affect efficiency.\n\nA central challenge in SBSP wireless power delivery is limiting diffraction-driven beam spreading, which typically requires very large transmitting apertures and precise phase control.\n\nMany SBSP concepts rely on retrodirective beam control: the ground-based rectenna sends a pilot signal that the satellite uses to steer the microwave beam back toward the receiver.\n\nJapan has extensive R&D experience in microwave power transmission and retrodirective beam pointing.\n\nAccording to J-spacesystems, SBSP development is accelerating in the United States, China and Europe, and the U.S. military is also widely believed to be pursuing its own experimental satellites.\n\nFirst proposed in the United States in the 1960s, the SBSP concept holds that space-based systems could deliver as much as 10 times more energy per year than terrestrial solar because cloud cover and the day-night cycle constrain generation on Earth.\n\nIn Japan, SBSP research and development has been under way since the 1980s. Through ground-based trials and other tests, Japan has advanced the demonstration and validation of key component technologies, including high-precision beam control, integrated generation-and-transmission panels, and more efficient conversion of electrical power into microwaves.\n\n“Technologically, Japan is leading the world in this field,” said Hiroki Yanagawa, a senior executive in J-spacesystems’ Satellite System and Earth Observation Division.\n\nSBSP COULD POWER LUNAR EXPLORATION\n\nIn 2023, the California Institute of Technology launched an SBSP demonstrator and succeeded in short‑distance power transmission in space as well as in detecting faint microwave signals on the ground. But it did not deliver usable electricity at meaningful levels.\n\nIf electricity beamed from OHISAMA can be received, converted and used on the ground, it would represent a world first.\n\nSuch a success would likely be followed by additional in-orbit trials, with an eye toward commercialization in the 2040s. Potential longer-term applications include supplying power from orbit to support lunar exploration missions.\n\nThe launch schedule, however, remains contingent on the performance of Space One’s Kairos rocket.\n\nAfter failures of the first two launches, attention has shifted to the flight of Kairos 3 on Feb. 25.\n\n“While overseas rockets were an option, we selected Kairos in line with national policy to support Japan’s private-sector launch capabilities,” said Yanagawa of J-spacesystems.",

    "description": "My 84-year-old grandpa joined me on my trip to Malta. At first, I was nervous about us traveling together, but I'm so grateful for the experience.",
    "fullText": "To me, Malta had always seemed like a special place.\n\nI'd grown up hearing stories from my dad about the joys of his childhood on the island, from after-school swims to days spent cliff-jumping.\n\nAlthough I'd been there as a kid, I wanted to go back as an adult to see what magic I'd missed on past visits and learn more about some of my family's roots.\n\nSo, last year, I booked a two-week solo trip to Malta. When I told my paternal grandpa about my plans, though, I had no idea he'd take it as an invitation to join me for a week.\n\nBefore I knew it, he'd bought his plane tickets, dug up his 50-year-old translation book, and had a map of Malta unfolded on the table.\n\nMy grandpa and I have always had a close bond thanks to years of weekly FaceTimes with him and my nana, plus our annual trips together.\n\nStill, I couldn't help feeling a little cautious, wondering if we'd drive each other mad (correction, if he'd drive me mad) after spending seven days straight together.\n\nWould we run out of things to talk about? At 84 years old, would he slow me down?\n\nUpon reflection, I feel a bit guilty for ever doubting him. I mean, exploring the streets of Valletta hardly compares to skydiving on his 80th birthday or climbing a mountain on his 83rd.\n\nHe carries an adventurous spirit into everything he does, and visiting Malta together was no exception. From jumping out of boats into crystal clear waters to walking almost 13,000 steps a day in the sun, I was the one who needed power naps — not him.\n\nThroughout our trip, we thoroughly enjoyed each other's company, often ending our busy days by sharing a few glasses of wine.\n\nI'll remember and cherish these moments forever, not because I may have let a few too many secrets about my smoking and drinking habits at university slip, but because at 25 and 84 years old, we never ran out of things to talk about. Our conversations were truly special.\n\nOne of my favorite moments, though, was when we visited his old home in Mtarfa, where the well-known kindness of the Maltese people truly shone.\n\nThe current owners welcomed us inside and allowed us to wander the halls where my dad once ran around as a boy.\n\nHaving lost my nana a few years ago, this experience felt all the more emotional and touching. Seeing her old bedroom and the garden where she used to sunbathe (with her pet duck sitting on her back), it's no surprise that my papa and I found ourselves a little emotional.\n\nAlthough our trip wasn't all smooth sailing — grandparents, please stop zooming in so much when you take photos — I found it to be a gentle reminder that spending time with your loved ones is the most important thing in life.\n\nMy grandpa painted a picture of what Malta was like 50 years ago — a time when life felt simpler, more stripped-back, and fully lived — and sharing this experience gave me a deeper understanding of why it was so special to my dad.\n\nAfter ordering my grandpa an Uber to the airport (his disbelief that you could hire a car through your phone still fresh in my mind), I admittedly felt a little sad.\n\nMaybe it was because I'd now be on my own for another week, but more than anything, it was the overwhelming gratitude for the special week we'd just shared.\n\nIt's a trip we both say we'll always hold close to our hearts, and one we look forward to taking again.\n\nIf you ever needed a sign to visit loved ones, let this be it — life's too short not to spend time with family.",

    "description": "My first trip to Vancouver, British Columbia, was full of surprises, from the lush forests to the floating gas station.",
    "fullText": "When I landed in Vancouver after a six-hour flight, I followed fellow passengers through the international terminal to customs. On the way, we walked through a room that made me stop in my tracks. It looked like a museum exhibit.\n\nKnown as the Pacific Passage, this room was designed by AldrichPears Associates to immerse visitors in the natural wonders of British Columbia upon arrival.\n\nAs I entered, I was entranced by the soundtracks of waves crashing and birds chirping through the overhead speaker. The room had a forest scene on the left, a body of water on the right, and sculptures by indigenous artists on display — a canoe in the water and a gigantic thunderbird suspended in the air, among others.\n\nI've grown accustomed to a lifestyle with limited access to nature in New York. We have plenty of parks, but the skyscrapers and bustling streets dominate the landscape. I long for more natural escapes within my city, but I always assumed the lack of them was the price you pay for a convenient, urban lifestyle.\n\nThat's not the case in Vancouver. From the downtown area to the quieter surrounding neighborhoods, various tree types stood as tall as the buildings, if not taller. There was no shortage of shade, and looking over the city from hilltops and hotel balconies, I could see how forests were embedded throughout the skyline.\n\nAfter seeing Vancouver's forests from a distance, I wanted a closer look. So I wandered Stanley Park and Jericho Beach Park. From the trails, it was easy to forget I was in the middle of a major city.\n\nHiking from one neighborhood to the next rather than walking through the developed streets was a scenic route I never expected to find.\n\nI spent my first night at the Fairmont Hotel Vancouver, a historic hotel that looks like a castle.\n\nI had stayed in a similar Fairmont in the past, Fairmont Le Château Frontenac in Quebec City, where the castle-like structure matched the old-world European-style town. But I was surprised by the Vancouver hotel's location in the middle of the downtown area in a busy city.\n\nThe Fairmont Hotel Vancouver looked like a medieval relic next to modern skyscrapers.\n\nI spent my second night in Vancouver at the Fairmont Pacific Rim, which overlooks Coal Harbour. From my balcony room on the 21st floor, I was astonished to spot a Chevron gas station in the water.\n\nInstalled in 2010, the Chevron Legacy is the only gas station for boats in the harbor. Its placement made sense, since I saw a marina full of yachts nearby, but I'd never previously thought about how boats fuel up.\n\nNYC's Billionaires' Row is world-famous for its ultra-luxury residential buildings with glass facades that tower over Central Park. Vancouver's Billionaires' Row looks vastly different.\n\nThe elite Belmont Avenue in the West Point Grey neighborhood is home to some of the most expensive real estate in the city, including a 10-bedroom, 16-bathroom mansion valued at roughly $72 million, Coast Reporter reported in January 2025.\n\nA 20-minute drive from downtown, Belmont Avenue is lined with mansions with large lots and ocean views. During my visit, I spotted a range of architectural styles, from Victorian to modern.\n\nThe most surprising part of these properties was the landscaping. Perfectly trimmed trees, bushes, and hedges stood above vibrant flower beds. They looked like grounds you'd find at a European palace.\n\nI love living in New York, but don't plan to stay here forever. I've always thought that whenever I decided to leave the city for a place with more space and nature, I'd end up somewhere that left me longing for the urban lifestyle.\n\nBut visiting Vancouver made me realize I can have it all — the mountains, the hikes, and the bustling city streets. On the day of my departure, I daydreamed about what my life would be like if I moved there. And one day, I just might.",

    "fullText": "On Tuesday, the United States Supreme Court heard arguments on behalf of  Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and Enbridge Energy on whether the state’s case to shut down the Line 5 pipeline should be heard in state or federal court.\n\nAt issue? Whether there are exceptions to the 30-day time limit to have a matter removed from state court to be heard in federal court.\n\nNessel first filed suit against the Canadian Pipeline company in 2019, though the case has yet to be resolved as years of legal maneuvering have moved the matter from state court to federal court and back.\n\nIn 2024, Nessel successfully argued that Enbridge had exceeded its 30-day time limit to have the case removed to federal court, with the company filing its request after more than a year of litigation. However, Enbridge maintains that U.S. district courts can excuse the time limit, leaving the Court to determine whether they hold this authority.\n\nFollowing arguments from Enbridge attorney John Bursch, Justice Clarence Thomas questioned why this case wasn’t removed to federal court like a similar suit filed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who voluntarily dismissed the case.\n\nNew: State shifts strategy on Line 5, drops federal case\n\nBursch explained that while the cases were similar, the Canadian government invoked a 1977 treaty concerning international pipelines in Whitmer’s case while a federal judge was weighing whether the matter should be heard in state or federal court.\n\nWhile it wasn’t clear whether Nessel’s initial case was within federal jurisdiction at the outset, the governor’s decision to terminate Enbridge’s right to operate Line 5 on the bottomlands of the Great Lakes and Canada’s treaty invocation changed the lay of the land.\n\nAfter Whitmer’s case was dismissed and Nessel announced she would move forward with her case at the state level, Bursch said the company filed its notice to remove the case to federal court within 15 days.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor asked what rights Enbridge is losing by having the matter heard in state court as opposed to federal court. \n\n “You have a right to have recovery for a loss or a potential loss, and the forum where that right is adjudicated is not lost,” Sotomayor said. “You have a forum, you have the state court. None of your remedies, like in some of our other cases, would be lost forever. None of your claims or defenses would be lost forever.”\n\nIn response Bursch pointed to two other Supreme Court cases where parties had lost the right to a particular legal mechanism to enforce their argument arguing that they were losing their right to have the case removed under similar conditions.\n\nLater in the hearing Justice Neil Gorsuch asked Bursch why Enbridge wanted to have the matter heard in federal court.\n\nThere are four reasons, Bursch explained. First, he argued there is value in having a case heard in a forum that respects federal authority. Second, Bursch said federal courts are uniquely qualified to decide matters of federal common law and foreign affairs.\n\nEnbridge would also like to have the option for the Supreme Court to be able to weigh in if an order to shut down the pipeline is upheld, and it has a separate case against the governor in federal court, Bursch explained.\n\nGorsuch probed further, asking whether Enbridge felt it could receive a fair trial in state court.\n\nWhile Bursch said state courts likely hadn’t dealt much with federal common law in the jurisdiction of foreign affairs, Gorsuch said the issue doesn’t often come up in federal district court either.\n\nGorsuch posed a similar question to Michigan Solicitor General Ann Sherman, asking if there’s a reason why the plaintiff would prefer to have the matter resolved in state court.\n\nSherman noted that the case was brought by a state official, addressing concerns of state law as to whether or not Enbridge had violated the state’s public trust doctrine, which determines that the state has a duty to manage natural resources for the benefit of the public.\n\nCongress has given legal parties a choice of forum, with Nessel, the plaintiff given the first choice of forum, Sherman said. Congress has also given the defense an opportunity to select a federal forum, Sherman said, arguing that if Enbridge thought the matter should have been heard in federal court, it should have responded in a timely manner.\n\nShe also argued that Congress had not given federal courts exclusive authority over matters of foreign affairs, and that even if the scope of the case goes beyond state law and into treaty matters, the state court can be trusted to handle it with the Supreme Court as a backdrop.\n\nJustice Sotomayor noted that a federal court had recently ruled in Enbridge’s favor, determining that federal law bars the state from ending Enbridge’s Line 5 easement. If the Supreme Court affirms the Sixth Circuit Court’s decision, leaving Nessel’s case in state court, there would be lawsuits relating to Line 5 in both state and federal court, she noted.\n\n“If you were to win here, are you willing to commit that you will ask the state court to continue its stay pending resolution of the federal action?” Sotomayor asked.\n\nWhile it was not something she’d discussed with Nessel, Sherman said it was certainly a strategic decision they could discuss.\n\nLine 5 is a 645-mile long pipeline stretching from Superior, Wis. to Sarnia, Ontario, transporting up to 23 million gallons of crude oil and natural gas liquids every day. A four mile segment of dual pipelines runs through the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Michigan and Lake Huron meet.\n\nMichigan’s 12 federally-recognized Tribal Nations and a number of environmental advocacy groups have called for the more than 70 year old pipeline to be decommissioned, raising concerns of an oil spill that deepened when Line 5 was struck by an anchor in 2018 and 2020.\n\nIn a statement Friday morning, Enbridge spokesperson Michael Barnes said the company was encouraged that the Supreme Court had agreed to review the case. He argued that the federal government holds the sole authority to regulate the pipeline, and that the case holds significant concerns for both energy security and foreign affairs.\n\nIn addition to Nessel’s case, the Whitmer administration has also asked the high court to determine whether the state is immune from the suit Enbridge filed against Whitmer and the director of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources for revoking its easement to operate Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac.\n\nThis story is breaking and will be updated with additional information.",

    "fullText": "Every year, the football world shifts its attention to one of the most important checkpoints in the pre-draft calendar — the NFL Scouting Combine. Hosted in Indianapolis at Lucas Oil Stadium, the event marks the true beginning of draft season for front offices across the National Football League. It’s where film study meets measurable reality — where speed, explosiveness, strength, and movement skills are tested under a microscope. For prospects, it’s not just an evaluation; it’s a high-stakes job interview played out in front of coaches, executives, and scouts from every team.\n\nThis year’s spotlight centers on the players ranked at the top of Daniel Jeremiah’s latest top prospect board, a group loaded with elite athletic traits and immediate NFL potential. The list reflects the modern direction of the league — explosive edge defenders, versatile defensive backs, dynamic skill players, and quarterbacks capable of handling complex offensive systems. While game tape built their reputations, the combine will test how those traits translate in standardized drills and competitive environments. For some, it’s a chance to confirm elite status. For others, it’s an opportunity to rise dramatically with one standout performance.\n\nAs the drills begin and the testing numbers roll in, these top prospects enter the most revealing phase of their pre-draft journey. The combine won’t finalize their draft positions — but it will shape the conversation around them in a big way.\n\nMendoza carries himself like a true franchise quarterback, showing poise and command in high-pressure situations. His arm talent allows him to make layered throws with timing and precision, while his size helps him absorb contact and stay composed. He processes defenses quickly and rarely looks rushed mentally. Teams see a quarterback who can operate structure but still create when plays break down.\n\nLove is one of the most explosive offensive weapons in the class, capable of scoring from anywhere on the field. His acceleration through the hole and long-speed in open space make him a constant big-play threat. He runs with patience and vision, then flips a switch once he sees daylight. If his testing matches the tape, he’ll solidify elite playmaker status.\n\nBailey is a disruptive edge rusher with the power and burst to stress offensive tackles snap after snap. He plays with physical urgency, attacking the pocket and forcing quarterbacks off their spots. His length helps him control contact and win leverage battles at the line. Evaluators are especially intrigued by how much more upside he still has as his pass-rush toolbox develops.\n\nReese is an explosive athlete off the edge with range that shows up against both the run and pass. He closes space quickly and flashes the ability to wreck plays in the backfield. His pursuit motor stands out — he doesn’t quit on plays and consistently chases down ball carriers. With refinement, he has the traits of a high-impact defensive playmaker.\n\nStyles brings size, speed, and versatility that allow him to impact the game in multiple defensive roles. He moves fluidly in coverage but also plays with downhill force against the run. His physical profile makes him a matchup eraser against modern hybrid offenses. Coaches value defenders who can stay on the field in any situation — Styles fits that mold.\n\nBain is a relentless pass rusher who plays with power, urgency, and technical discipline. He consistently generates pressure by converting speed to strength and attacking leverage points. His intensity shows in how hard he plays every snap, especially in pursuit. He profiles as the type of defender offenses must account for in protection schemes.\n\nTate is a refined route runner who wins with timing, precision, and body control. He tracks the ball naturally and consistently positions himself to make difficult catches look routine. His game is built on reliability — quarterbacks can trust him to be exactly where he’s supposed to be. He projects as a dependable high-volume receiving target.\n\nDelane is a long, athletic corner with strong coverage instincts and physical press ability. He competes aggressively at the catch point and shows confidence challenging receivers downfield. His movement skills allow him to stay attached through routes and recover when needed. He has the traits teams look for in a boundary corner who can handle top matchups.\n\nDowns is a true playmaking safety with range, awareness, and sharp diagnostic skills. He reads offensive concepts quickly and arrives at the ball with decisive speed. Whether in coverage or run support, he consistently impacts plays with sound positioning. His instincts and football IQ make him one of the most complete defensive backs in the class.\n\nLemon is an electric playmaker whose acceleration and agility stand out immediately. He thrives after the catch, turning short receptions into explosive gains with quick cuts and burst. His ability to stretch the field vertically adds another dimension to his game. Offenses will value his versatility and big-play potential from multiple alignments.\n\nUltimately, this group represents the talent expected to define the early portion of the 2026 NFL Draft. The combine serves as both validation and opportunity — confirming what evaluators believe while opening the door for new storylines. From measurable dominance to unexpected breakout performances, this week helps transform top prospects into future professionals.\n\nOLYMPICS: Final 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings\n\nNFL: 4 blockbuster NFL trades we want to see before the 2026 draft\n\nNFL DRAFT: 2026 NFL Scouting Combine day-to-day TV schedule, how to watch\n\nMLB: MLB Power Rankings as 2026 Spring Training begins\n\nNBA: Updated NBA Power Rankings as a new week begins\n\nVIRAL: Watch Johnny Gaudreau’s children join Team USA hockey gold medal celebration\n\nThe post Top draft prospects ahead of the 2026 NFL scouting combine appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court said Monday that it will hear from oil and gas companies trying to block lawsuits seeking to hold the industry liable for billions of dollars in damage linked to climate change.\n\nThe conservative-majority court agreed to take up a case from Boulder, Colorado, one of multiple lawsuits alleging the companies deceived the public about how fossil fuels contribute to climate change.\n\nGovernments around the country have sought damages totaling billions of dollars, arguing it's necessary to help pay for rebuilding after wildfires, rising sea levels and severe storms worsened by climate change. The lawsuits come amid a wave of legal actions in California, Hawaii and New Jersey and worldwide seeking to leverage action through the courts.\n\nThe case out of Boulder County will likely have implications for other lawsuits, some of which have been dismissed while others work their way through state courts.\n\nSuncor Energy and ExxonMobil appealed to the Supreme Court after Colorado’s highest court let the Boulder case proceed. The companies argue emissions are a national issue that should be heard in federal court, where similar suits have been tossed out.\n\n“The use of state law to address global climate change represents a serious threat to one of our Nation’s most critical sectors,” attorneys wrote. ExxonMobil said Monday that “climate policy shouldn’t be set through fragmented state‑court actions.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration weighed in to support the companies and urge the justices to reverse the Colorado Supreme Court decision, saying it would mean “every locality in the country could sue essentially anyone in the world for contributing to global climate change.”\n\nTrump, a Republican, criticized the lawsuits in an executive order, and the Justice Department has sought to head some off in court.\n\nAttorneys for Boulder had agued that the litigation is still in early stages and should stay in state court. “There is no constitutional bar to states addressing in-state harms caused by out-of-state conduct, be it the negligent design of an automobile or sale of asbestos,” they wrote.\n\nCity officials said the case was about dealing with problems people are facing in Colorado. “Our case is, fundamentally, about fairness. Boulder is already experiencing the effects of a rapidly warming climate, and the financial burden of adaptation should not fall solely on local taxpayers,\" said Jonathan Koehn, its climate initiatives director.\n\nThe Supreme Court also asked the two sides to present arguments on whether the case is truly ready to be heard by the justices. Arguments are expected in the fall.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court.",

    "fullText": "TORONTO (AP) — Canada announced Monday that it is working on an aid package for Cuba as it faces blackouts and severe fuel shortages worsened by a U.S oil embargo.\n\nForeign Minister Anita Anand declined to give details beyond that.\n\n“We are preparing a plan to assist. We are not prepared at this point to provide any details of the announcement,” Anand said.\n\nCuba is facing an increasingly dire energy crisis that has heightened in recent weeks after oil shipments from Venezuela, its main oil supplier, were halted when the U.S. attacked the South American country in early January and arrested its leader. Mexico, another major supplier, then also suspended oil shipments under U.S. pressure.\n\nAir Canada and other airlines have canceled flights to the Caribbean island because of a shortage of aviation fuel on the island.\n\nCanadian tourism is vital to Cuba’s economy. Global Affairs Canada, a governmental office, has said Canada is Cuba’s second-largest source of direct investment to the island, particularly in the mining and tourism sectors.\n\nCanada would join Mexico in providing aid.\n\nTwo Mexican Navy ships laden with humanitarian aid docked in Cuba earlier this month, two weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on countries that sell oil to the island, deepening an already severe economic and energy crisis in the Caribbean nation. The ships brought about 800 tons of goods, and another 1,500 tons of powdered milk and beans.\n\nThe economic crisis gripping Cuba since 2020 has been compounded by intensified U.S. sanctions aimed at forcing a change in the island’s political model. These pressures led to critical shortages and severe blackouts that peaked in early 2026.\n\nBecause Cuba produces only 40% of its required fuel, it remains highly vulnerable to external blockades. While strong allies like Russia and China have condemned the U.S. measures, their support has remained largely symbolic thus far.\n\nFollow AP’s Latin America coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

    "fullText": "Sam Altman is pushing back on the idea that ChatGPT consumes too much energy.\n\n\"One of the things that is always unfair in this comparison is people talk about how much energy it takes to train an AI model relative to how much it costs a human to do one inference query,\" Altman told The Indian Express last week on the sidelines of a major AI summit. \"But it also takes a lot of energy to train a human.\"\n\nAltman suggested it's not an apples-to-apples comparison, arguing that it's unfair to discount the years spent nurturing and educating someone to be capable of making their own inquiries.\n\n\"It takes a lot of energy to train a human,\" he said, prompting some laughter in the crowd. \"It takes, like, 20 years of life, and all of the food you eat during that time before you get smart.\"\n\nAltman said the clock really began thousands of years ago.\n\n\"It took, like, the very widespread evolution of the 100 billion people that have ever lived and learned not to get eaten by predators and learned how to, like, figure out science or whatever,\" he said.\n\nAltman also called out what he said were \"totally insane\" claims on the internet that OpenAI is guzzling down water to power ChatGPT.\n\n\"Water is totally fake,\" Altman said, when asked about concerns AI companies use too much water. \"It used to be true, we used to do evaporative cooling in data centers, but now that we don't do that, you know, you see these like things on the internet where, 'Don't use ChatGPT, it's 17 gallons of water for each query' or whatever.\"\n\nIn June, Altman said that the average ChatGPT query consumes roughly the amount of energy needed to power a lightbulb for a few minutes.\n\n\"People are often curious about how much energy a ChatGPT query uses; the average query uses about 0.34 watt-hours, about what an oven would use in a little over one second, or a high-efficiency lightbulb would use in a couple of minutes,\" he wrote on X.\n\nAltman said it is fair as a whole to point out the AI industry's overall energy consumption because of the large growth in usage. He said it's why he and other AI CEOs have pushed alternative energy sources like solar, wind, and nuclear.\n\nUnlike other CEOs, namely xAI's Elon Musk, Altman is dismissive of the idea that space-based data centers are realistic in the next decade, a concept that some companies have floated as a way to reduce energy consumption.\n\nOutside of OpenAI, Altman is a major investor in nuclear energy. He previously served as chairman of Oklo, a nuclear energy startup, and has been a major backer of Helion, which plans to build what it calls \"the world's first fusion power plant\" in Washington state.\n\nIn the US, data center energy consumption is becoming a major topic. Last month, President Donald Trump said he was working with tech companies on \"a commitment to the American people\" to ensure that citizens don't pay higher energy bills because of a nearby data center.\n\nConsulting firm McKinsey & Company estimated last year that data centers could account for 14% of total power demand in the US by 2050.",

    "description": "After a major 2024 sale, hundreds of American convenience stores changed hands. The new owner is a powerful Mexican company you might not have heard of.",
    "fullText": "A transaction in October of 2024, between an American company and a Mexican one, resulted in a chain of U.S.-located gas station convenience stores being owned by the Mexican firm. The American company is Delek US Holdings, Inc., which sold its retail operations for $385 million. These retail operations consisted of 249 convenience stores that operated under the DK brand, located in New Mexico, Arkansas, and Texas. Delek is an energy company involved in petroleum and renewable fuels. As an oil products producer, it has a refining capacity of 302,000 barrels each day. It is also one of five owners of the 650-mile oil pipeline that goes from Wink to Webster in the Permian Basin in Texas, moving over one million barrels per day of crude oil and condensate to the Gulf Coast.\n\nThe Mexican company that bought the convenience stores at Delek's gas stations is called FEMSA. It's a huge conglomerate that includes the OXXO chain of 28,800 convenience stores located in Mexico, Chile, Peru, Brazil, and Colombia. FEMSA also owns the largest volume Coca-Cola products franchise bottler in the world. It has a total of over 392,000 employees located in 18 countries, including Europe, having purchased the food retail company Valora in 2022. FEMSA is also involved in many other business ventures, including retail drugstores and digital financial services.\n\nFEMSA has now rebranded many DK stores, which now operate as OXXO, a well-known brand near the Mexican border. By 2027, all of the stores in the El Paso area, which adjoins the border, will be rebranded as OXXO stores. Once the OXXO brand starts to expand beyond its initial footprint, it may build even larger stores, following the trend of U.S. gas stations turning into massive convenience stores.\n\nAs far as the supply of fuel products to the stores, FEMSA has continued to purchase them from Delek after the ownership change. Delek continues to operate hundreds of gas stations under both the DK and Alon brands, positioning itself as a locally sourced, high-quality fuel supplier with a lower carbon footprint. While this acquisition may have been FEMSA's first attempt to plant its flag in the U.S., the company has said it has plans to become a major player in the U.S. market. FEMSA is not the only foreign operator to land here; the Speedway gas station chain is owned by a Japanese company.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "description": "\"The body is metabolizing its own muscle tissue for energy,\" Prokopenko said.",
    "fullText": "Four years after Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s economy has entered a “death zone,” said Alexandra Prokopenko, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.\n\nIn a recent Economist op-ed, the former Russian central bank adviser drew on a term from mountain climbing when high altitude forces the body to consume itself faster than it can repair itself.\n\nWhat is Russia's economic 'death zone'?\n\nWhat signs indicate Russia may face economic crisis?\n\nHow has the war impacted Russia's economic structure?\n\nWhy can't monetary policy fix Russia's economic problems?\n\n“Russia’s economy is stuck in what might be described as negative equilibrium: holding itself together while steadily destroying its own future capacity,” she wrote.\n\nThe economy isn’t headed for an imminent crash, but GDP has stagnated, oil revenue has been halved amid Western sanctions, and the government’s budget deficit is rapidly draining reserves.\n\nAt the same time, two economic systems have emerged. One is comprised of the military and related industries that receive priority from the Kremlin. And then there’s everything else that’s been “left in the cold,” Prokopenko explained.\n\n“The most dangerous feature of this new structure is the fuel it burns,” she added. “Russia’s economy now runs on what might be called ‘military rent’: budget transfers to defense enterprises that generate wages and economic activity.”\n\nBut the transfers are aimed at assets designed for destruction, Prokopenko pointed out. In other words, the money that keeps Russia’s factories humming pays for tanks, armored vehicles and other weapons that eventually get destroyed or damaged, making them useless for future economic growth.\n\nSimilarly, money spent to attract fresh recruits to Russia’s army doesn’t retrain them to become more productive. Instead, many die or return home permanently wounded. The Center for Strategic and International Studies has estimated Russian military casualties at 1.2 million, including 325,000 killed.\n\n“The body is metabolizing its own muscle tissue for energy,” Prokopenko said.\n\nWhile the central bank has cut interest rates to prop up growth and the Kremlin has taken steps to rein in the budget deficit, Russia’s economic predicament can’t be fixed with monetary or fiscal policies, she wrote.\n\nIn fact, interest payments on government debt this year are already set to exceed spending on education and health care combined.\n\nUnlike a cyclical downturn such as a recession, Prokopenko argued that what Russia is suffering from is more akin to altitude sickness—”the longer you stay, the worse it gets, regardless of rest.”",

    "description": "Analysts were largely expecting a supply glut that would push oil prices down through 2026. Instead, prices have rallied through the first months of the year.",
    "fullText": "Coming into 2026, the consensus view among oil analysts was that the crude market was entering a period of deep oversupply, likely to keep depressing prices throughout the year. In 2025, oil prices fell by roughly 20% as the glut widened.\n\nInstead, oil prices have seen an unexpected rally through the start of the year on a combination of geopolitical shocks and stronger-than-expected demand. Prices are now higher than they were six months ago, leaving traders \"focused on why a large global surplus ... has not translated into a sustained Brent price decline in 2026 year-to-date,\" Goldman Sachs strategists wrote in a note to clients.\n\nBut those two metrics don't necessarily have to move together, analysts told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"My thinking here is that those two things ... they could live together,\" Jorge León, the head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nFutures on Brent crude (BZ=F), the international pricing benchmark, have gained roughly 15% since the start of the year, while those on US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CL=F) are up a slightly smaller 14%.\n\nAs of January, the International Energy Agency has estimated that the oil market would be oversupplied by roughly 3.7 million barrels per day (bpd), what Macquarie analysts called an \"extraordinary oversupply\" in a recent client note.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC+, spent much of 2025 unwinding production cuts. In the Americas, US shale production has remained at record volumes alongside growth from other exporting nations in the region, while global demand for hydrocarbons was expected to broadly decline as the world turned toward electrification and other forms of green energy.\n\nBut prices have risen anyway as traders have priced in a variety of unexpected supply constraints and upticks in demand forecasts.\n\nSanctions from the US Treasury Department on Rosneft and Lukoil, two of Russia's largest oil producers, appear to have taken roughly 600,000 bpd off the market, while exports from the CPC pipeline, which runs between the Caspian and Black seas, have dropped by roughly 440,000 bpd to the lowest level in at least seven years after drone strikes at the Black Sea-side exporting terminal.\n\nAt the same time, growing prospects of military action by the US against Iran have sent oil prices surging on the possibility of disruptions to the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global chokepoint that sees roughly 20 million bpd of petroleum products cross its waters. Attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea have rerouted tanker traffic around Africa's Cape of Good Hope, tightening physical delivery markets and increasing freight costs for oil products moving between Europe and Asia.",

    "fullText": "BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungary will block a planned 90-billion-euro ($106-billion) European Union loan to Ukraine until the flow of Russian oil through the Druzhba pipeline resumes, Hungary's foreign minister said.\n\nRussian oil shipments to Hungary and Slovakia have been interrupted since Jan. 27 after what Ukrainian officials said was a Russian drone attack damaged the Druzhba pipeline, which carries Russian crude across Ukrainian territory and into Central Europe.\n\nHungary and Slovakia, which have both received a temporary exemption from an EU policy prohibiting imports of Russian oil, have accused Ukraine — without providing evidence — of deliberately holding up supplies. Both countries ceased shipping diesel to Ukraine this week over the interruption in oil flows .\n\nIn a video posted on social media Friday evening, Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó accused Ukraine of “blackmailing” Hungary by failing to restart shipments. He said his government would block a massive interest-free loan the EU approved in December to help Kyiv to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years.\n\n“We will not give in to this blackmail. We do not support Ukraine’s war, we will not pay for it,” Szijjártó said. “As long as Ukraine blocks the resumption of oil supplies to Hungary, Hungary will block European Union decisions that are important and favorable for Ukraine.”\n\nHungary's decision to block the key funding came two days after it suspended diesel shipments to its embattled neighbor and only days before the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion.\n\nNearly every country in Europe has significantly reduced or entirely ceased Russian energy imports since Moscow launched its war in Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Yet Hungary and Slovakia — both EU and NATO members — have maintained and even increased supplies of Russian oil and gas.\n\nHungary’s nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has long argued Russian fossil fuels are indispensable for its economy and that switching to energy sourced from elsewhere would cause an immediate economic collapse — an argument some experts dispute.\n\nWidely seen as the Kremlin’s biggest advocate in the EU, Orbán has vigorously opposed the bloc’s efforts to sanction Moscow over its invasion, and blasted attempts to hit Russia’s energy revenues that help finance the war. His government has frequently threatened to veto EU efforts to assist Ukraine.\n\nOn Saturday, Slovakia's populist Prime minister Robert Fico said his country will stop providing emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine if oil is not flowing through the Druzhba by Monday. Orbán's chief of staff, Gergely Gulyás, said earlier this week that Hungary, too, was exploring the possibility of cutting off its electricity supplies to Ukraine.\n\nNot all of the EU's 27 countries agreed to take part in the 90-billion-euro loan package for Kyiv. Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic opposed the plan, but a deal was reached in which they did not block the loan and were promised protection from any financial fallout.",

    "fullText": "HILL AIR FORCE BASE, Utah (AP) — The Pentagon and the Energy Department for the first time airlifted a small nuclear reactor from California to Utah, demonstrating what they say is the U.S. potential to quickly deploy nuclear power for military and civilian use.\n\nThe nearly 700-mile flight last weekend — which transported a 5-megawatt microreactor without nuclear fuel — highlights the Trump administration’s drive to promote nuclear energy to help meet skyrocketing demand for power from artificial intelligence and data centers, as well as for use by the military.\n\nEnergy Secretary Chris Wright and Undersecretary of Defense Michael Duffey, who traveled with the privately built reactor, hailed the Feb. 15 trip on a C-17 military aircraft as a breakthrough for U.S. efforts to fast-track commercial licensing for the microreactors, part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to reshape the country's energy landscape.\n\nPresident Donald Trump supports nuclear power — a carbon-free source of electricity — as a reliable energy source, even as he has been broadly hostile to renewable energy and prioritizes coal and other fossil fuels to produce electricity.\n\nSkeptics warn that nuclear energy poses risks and say microreactors may not be safe or feasible and have not proved they can meet demand for a reasonable price.\n\nWright brushed those concerns aside as he touted progress on Trump’s push for a quick escalation of nuclear power. Trump signed a series of executive orders last year that allow Wright to approve some advanced reactor designs and projects, taking authority away from the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which has regulated the U.S. nuclear industry for five decades.\n\n“Today is history. A multi-megawatt, next-generation nuclear power plant is loaded in the C-17 behind us,” Wright said before the two-hour flight from March Air Reserve Base in California to Hill Air Force Base in Utah.\n\nThe minivan-sized reactor transported by the military is one of at least three that will reach “criticality” — when a nuclear reaction can sustain an ongoing series of reactions — by July 4, as Trump has promised, Wright said.\n\n“That’s speed, that’s innovation, that’s the start of a nuclear renaissance,” he said.\n\nCurrently, there are 94 operable nuclear reactors in the U.S. that generate about 19% of the country’s electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That's down from 104 reactors in 2013 and includes two new commercial reactors in Georgia that were the nation's first large reactors built from scratch in a generation.\n\nRecognizing delays inherent to deployment of new, full-scale reactors, the industry and government have focused in recent years on more efficient designs, including a small modular reactor proposed by the nation’s largest public power company, the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n\nMicroreactors, designed to be portable, can “accelerate the delivery of resilient power to where it’s needed,” Duffey said. Eventually, the mobile reactors could provide energy security on a military base without the civilian grid, he and other officials said.\n\nThe demonstration flight “gets us closer to deploy nuclear power when and where it is needed to give our nation’s warfighters the tools to win in battle,” Duffey said.\n\nThe reactor transported to Utah will be able to generate up to 5 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 5,000 homes, said Isaiah Taylor, CEO of Valar Atomics, the California startup that produced the reactor. The company hopes to start selling power on a test basis next year and become fully commercial in 2028.\n\nEdwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the transport flight — which included a throng of reporters, photographers and TV news crews — was little more than “a dog-and-pony show” that merely demonstrated the Pentagon's ability to ship a piece of heavy equipment.\n\nThe flight “doesn't answer any questions about whether the project is feasible, economic, workable or safe — for the military and the public,” Lyman said in an interview.\n\nThe Trump administration “hasn't made the safety case” for how microreactors, once loaded with nuclear fuel, can be transported securely to data centers or military bases, Lyman said.\n\nOfficials also have not resolved how nuclear waste will be disposed of, although Wright said the Energy Department is in talks with Utah and other states to host sites that could reprocess fuel or handle permanent disposal.\n\nThe microreactor flown to Utah will be sent to the Utah San Rafael Energy Lab for testing and evaluation, Wright said. Fuel will be provided by the Nevada National Security site, Taylor said.\n\n“The answer to energy is always more,” Wright said. After four years of restrictions on fossil fuels and other polluting energy under the Biden administration, he said, “Now we’re trying to set everything free. And nuclear will be flying soon.”",

    "description": "A pioneering energy-generating device utilizes reliable wind speeds at an altitude of 6,500 feet (2,000 meters).",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nA Chinese energy firm has successfully tested an experimental blimp-like wind turbine capable of generating energy in the skies above cities and inland communities.\n\nDeveloped by Beijing Linyi Yunchuan Energy Technology, the S2000 airborne wind energy system (AWES) is a large, helium-filled airship containing 12 wind turbines.\n\nThe craft ascends thousands of feet into the air to harness the stable wind speeds at higher altitudes, which spin the turbines and generate electricity. This is then sent down the tethering cable to the ground below, where it can enter the grid.\n\nIn its test flight, the manufacturers flew the S2000 at an altitude of 6,560 feet (2,000 meters) above Sichuan Province, generating 385 kilowatt-hours of electricity.\n\nThis is enough to power the average U.S. household for approximately 13.3 days, per usage figures provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nIn total, the S2000 clocks in at 197 feet (60 m) long, 131 feet (40 m) high and 131 feet (40 m) wide, as reported by Global Times. The system is rated at 3 megawatts total power capacity.\n\nThe new technology has a couple of potential uses, the developers suggest. \"One is for off-grid settings like border outposts, where it can serve as a relatively stable conventional energy source,” explained Weng Hanke, CTO at Linyi Yunchuan Energy Technology, as reported by Tide News — an affiliate of the state-owned Zhejiang Daily Press Group — via Global Times.\n\n\"The other is to complement traditional ground-based wind power systems, creating a three-dimensional approach to energy supply.\"\n\nIf realized at scale, the approach could have transformational potential for countries with constrained space for onshore wind generation, such as many in mainland Europe, as well as those without the shallow seabeds necessary for offshore wind power generation, such as Japan.\n\nHowever, the reliability of the tethered cable for delivering stable power to the grid will require further testing.\n\nIn all but the most remote rural communities, the 1.25-mile (2,000 m) cable could present a dangerous obstacle to aircraft. In the U.K., the Civil Aviation Authority requires those wishing to fly tethered balloons above 200 feet (60 m) to apply for special permission to avoid risk to aircraft sharing airspace with the balloon.\n\nBeyond its safety concerns, the S2000 will also need to undergo rigorous testing to ensure its viability for reliable commercial operations. Standard wind turbines require regular maintenance and the craft could prove difficult and more costly to service as it will have to return to the ground for every repair.\n\nWind turbines can generate more power where the wind power density — the measure of wind energy that can be harnessed at a given altitude — is higher. Offshore wind turbines, for example, can capture the higher, more consistent wind speeds over open water.\n\nThese offshore turbines can also be significantly larger than their onshore counterparts, with the hub of Chinese manufacturer Dongfang Electric’s DEW-26 MW-310 offshore turbine standing at 606.9 feet (185 m). Floating wind turbines can be similarly gigantic, with the tower for the recently-revealed, record breaking floating wind turbine from China Huaneng Group reaching 489 feet (152 m).\n\nFor example, the average offshore wind speed deemed suitable for wind farms at 295 feet (90 m) elevation within U.S. waters is 7 meters per second, per the Marine Cadastre National Viewer, a web-based data viewer produced by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office for Coastal Management.\n\n—China builds record-breaking floating wind turbine — it could change the face of renewable energy\n\n—Chinese scientists have found a way to make batteries more efficient — by using water\n\nIt’s hard to state the exact wind speed at various altitudes, as this varies by location and weather.\n\nThe aerospace group Omnidea estimates that at altitudes between 328 and 8,200 feet (100 and 2,500 m), wind power density increases by approximately a factor of six, with an average wind speed of 33.5 mph (15 m/s) at 8,200 feet\n\nThis highlights the potential efficiencies to be unlocked with greater exploitation of higher-altitude wind speeds with tethered, flying wind turbines such as the S2000.",

    "description": "I sort of hoped Brain.fm was selling snake oil, but I liked it more than I expected to.",
    "fullText": "Sometimes a life hack works when I wish it didn't. I, for example, am vulnerable to depression and anxiety. I also passionately hate running. I have, unfortunately, discovered that running regularly helps my mental health a great deal. I'm thankful (because I feel better) and resentful (because I have to run).\n\nThis is how I feel about Brain.fm, a music service I discovered a couple weeks ago when the company got in touch with me. I started using the service, mostly for the purposes of writing this article, and something unexpected happened: I noticed it's a great deal easier to get started on my work in the morning. I like this (because I'm getting more done) but am also annoyed (because I'd rather be listening to the music I love).\n\nIt's a conundrum. Brain.fm is a subscription service that costs $14.99 per month, more than Spotify (which costs $12.99 per month). The product sells itself as having a collection of music backed by scientific research to increase your ability to focus, meditate, and sleep. There's also a free trial, meaning you can get a feel for whether it works for you.\n\nAfter a few weeks of testing, I feel it might be onto something. I don't always trust my intuition, though, so I wanted to dig deeper. Is this for real? Or am I falling for snake oil? More importantly: can I go back to listening to KEXP in the morning?\n\nAfter a few days of using the application, I couldn't help but wonder. Is my increased focus real? Or is it a placebo?\n\nSo I wrote to Daniel J. Levitin, professor emeritus of neurology at McGill University, and author of This Is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession. He replied quickly, and concisely: \"It's all placebo,\" he said.\n\nIt was a very concise email from an academic about a complex topic, which as a journalist is always nice. But Levitin didn't stop there—he told me to get in touch with another neuroscientist, one who had published research on this type of modulated music. I'll say more below about that research, but first, let's take a look at what's actually in those Brain.fm tracks.\n\nYou can't use this service to search for a specific artist—you instead let the application know what you're trying to do (Focus, Relax, Meditate, or Sleep). In the Focus section, there are a few sub-options: Deep Work, Motivation, Creativity, Learning, and Light Work. Choose what you want to do and a track will start playing.\n\nThe genres, such as they are, range from the kind of \"chill beats\" you can find on YouTube to post-rock and symphonic—though it's all instrumental.\n\n\"The basic problem is that most music is made to grab your attention,\" Kevin Woods, a neuroscience PhD who works for Brain.fm, told me. \"If you talk to a music producer, they'll tell you that their job is to make things punchy and bright, and to make somebody sit up and turn their head and favorite the song on Spotify.\"\n\nThat attention seeking can make playing music during the work day distracting in a subtle way, according to Woods. \"The problem is that a lot of the distraction is not overt in the sense of, 'I can feel my attention breaking and I have to turn this off or turn down the volume'—it's more like, 'I'm working at 70, 80% capacity, and I'm not really sure why.'\"\n\nSo the music at Brain.fm is written and performed by in-house composers who are intentionally trying not to keep your attention. But that alone doesn't really set Brain.fm apart from using ambient music or video game soundtracks to focus, let alone the various \"chill beats\" playlists and live streams that are out there. And that's where Brain.fm's scientific claims come in.\n\nBrain.fm points to several scientific studies on its homepage, also mentioning that its research was in part funded by that National Science Foundation. A lot of the claims are based on \"amplitude modulation,\" which Woods told me is what sets Brain.fm's music apart.\n\nBut what is amplitude modulation? They're \"fast modulations added that do not usually occur in music,\" according to Woods. If you listen to the music for a bit, you'll hear an almost fluttering kind of sound. These sounds, which are added to compositions in post-production using AI, are available at three different levels for each track. The \"ADHD Mode,\" which is the highest of the three settings, is what I mostly used while testing.\n\nI find this effect a little bit disorienting, so I sometimes needed to turn the setting down. It's hard to deny the effect is a musical signature of Brain.fm. But does it work?\n\nI became a bit less skeptical of the science after getting in touch with the expert that Levitin recommended: Psyche Loui, a neuroscientist, musician, and Associate Dean of Research at Northeastern University. Loui told me that \"it's not all placebo\", pointing to a paper she published alongside Woods and other neurologists in Communications Biology.\n\nNow, to be clear, it's not unusual for scientists to disagree about how things work—that's part of the process. And the claims made by the paper are narrow—the conclusion is that music with amplitude modulation can help people focus on tasks when compared to both pink noise and music without amplitude modulation. The control music, according to Woods, were the same tracks—the only difference was whether amplitude modulation was added. The results of testing, and brain scans, suggest the effect is real.\n\n\"We did something which is rarely done in music research, which is a very well-controlled study that only changes one factor in the music,\" Woods told me. As with all scientific research, there's always more to learn. But to me, a study making these claims published in a Nature-affiliated publication suggests there might be something to this.\n\nBrain.fm, if nothing else, has been an opportunity to reflect on my relationship with music. I really enjoy discovering new music during the workday, but after using Brain.fm for a few weeks I wonder if that might have been the reason I have trouble focusing in the morning.\n\nMaybe it's best to listen to music that fades into the background when it's time to focus, and save music discovery for when I only need part of my brain. And maybe I should save the music I really love for when I'm not working at all. Brain.fm, if nothing else, taught me that.\n\nBut I also find that the music really does work when I need to focus. I still am not fully sure if the effect is real, or if any music that blends into the background would do the job. I sometimes play the entire Boards of Canada discography when I need to focus, and find that works about as well.\n\nAll that having been said, I really think anyone who has read this much about Brain.fm should probably go ahead and see for themselves.",

    "fullText": "Oil is spiking on the latest bout of tensions between the US and Iran, and Goldman Sachs's top commodities researcher says more volatility may be coming.\n\nDaan Struyven, the bank's co-head of global commodities research, told CNBC that he thinks the market sees tensions escalating further between the US and Iran, a likely catalyst for price hikes and longer-term volatility. Both US and international oil prices were up about 2% on Thursday.\n\n\"Both prediction markets and oil markets are pricing some near-term moderate escalation as the base case,\" he said.\n\nOne area in focus is the Strait of Hormuz, a waterway in the Middle East that handles 20% of both the global oil and liquified natural gas supplies.\n\nStruyven highlighted the passage's importance for international oil flows, adding that Goldman's base case assumes shipping through the strait will continue and that his team is not anticipating any long-term disruptions.\n\nHowever, Iran is one of the world's leading oil suppliers, and its government has made it clear that it intends to retaliate if President Donald Trump moves forward with his threats against it. This could mean attempting to block or restrict access to the Strait of Hormuz, throttling supply.\n\nIf this were to curtail flows by 1 million barrels per day for an entire year, Struyven predicted that would justify an $8 per barrel price increase, a roughly 11% jump from Thursday's price for Brent crude around $71.50. However, he also noted that fear among traders could push prices even higher, adding to the volatility in the market.\n\n\"Markets are continuously reassessing, not only the base case, but especially the probability of this tail risk of large oil disruptions in the Middle East,\" he said.\n\nOil prices have risen this year after tumbling throughout 2025. The volatility in energy markets follows bouts of volatility related to the US attack on Venezuela in January and continued saber-rattling on Iran.",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian drones struck a Russian oil depot overnight, breaking through the netting that had been installed earlier to protect the site from such attacks, a security official told Business Insider on Thursday.\n\nLong-range Ukrainian drones struck an oil depot in Velikiye Luki, a city in western Russia's Pskov region, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said. They were only authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.\n\nThe source said protective anti-drone nets had been stretched above fuel tanks at the oil depot. The facility belongs to the company Pskovnefteproduct and is located nearly 500 kilometers (310 miles) from the Ukrainian border. The nets were unable to prevent the strike from doing damage, the source added.\n\nSatellite imagery captured in December by US spatial intelligence firm Vantor and analyzed by Business Insider, shows what appears to be anti-drone netting covering roughly 15 tanks at the depot in Velikiye Luki.\n\nSeveral explosions and a large fire were reported at the oil facility, the source said, citing local channels on the Telegram messaging app. Video footage shared on social media shows a massive blaze burning through a structure resembling anti-drone netting.\n\nThis kind of netting has been spotted at other oil facilities in Russia in recent months. The tactic underscores how the country is turning to crude-looking, improvised defenses to protect energy infrastructure from ongoing Ukrainian attacks.\n\n\"Vietnam, run!\" - overnight, drones from the Special Operations Center \"Alpha\" of the Security Service of Ukraine successfully struck the Velikolukskaya oil depot. A large fire broke out at the site. Anti-drone nets had been stretched over the fuel storage tanks, but they did not… pic.twitter.com/bLBxuHNxtm\n\nConcerns over the high drone saturation have led to similar measures on the battlefield.\n\nAnti-drone netting is common near the front lines. Ukrainian soldiers are using this material to cover critical logistics routes. And both militaries have added cage-like fencing to their armored vehicles to protect against drones.\n\nAdditionally, Russia has also installed makeshift defenses, such as large, floating barriers, to protect its ports from the Ukrainian naval drones that have wreaked havoc on its Black Sea Fleet.\n\nThe Ukrainian attack on Wednesday night marked Kyiv's latest deep-strike drone operation against the vast Russian energy sector, a major source of revenue that fuels Moscow's ongoing war efforts.\n\n\"The SBU continues to work methodically on facilities that provide the Russian army with fuel,\" the security source said in a translated statement.\n\n\"The destruction of oil depots directly affects the enemy's ability to conduct combat operations, advance and transfer reserves. Such operations are an element of the systematic weakening of the military potential of the Russian Federation,\" they added.\n\nNeither Russia's defense ministry nor its US embassy responded to a request for comment on the attack. Moscow said its air defenses shot down roughly 300 Ukrainian drones over the past 24 hours.\n\nSince last August, Ukraine has been intensifying its long-range drone attacks on Russia's energy sector, targeting oil refineries, terminals, tankers, and platforms at sea. Kyiv has described the deep-strike campaign as its way of imposing \"long-range sanctions\" on Moscow.\n\nMany of these attacks — at least four in the past week, including the most recent strike — have been carried out by the SBU's Alpha group, an elite unit considered to be among the best of Ukraine's special forces. Its personnel have also been involved in ground operations.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia has significantly stepped up its missile and drone strikes against Ukraine's energy infrastructure this winter compared to previous years of the war.\n\nSince October, Ukrainian energy facilities have been the main target of Russian barrages, Britain's defense ministry said on Thursday.\n\nRussia has launched more than 20,000 drones, and its aircraft have fired over 300 missiles, \"in attempts to systematically destroy Ukraine's electrical grid and heat generation capacity,\" the ministry said in an intelligence update.",

    "description": "Oil prices are up after three straight years of decline as geopolitical tensions ignite supply fears in the energy market.",
    "fullText": "Oil prices have climbed in recent weeks, even as a global surplus has left hundreds of millions of barrels floating offshore.\n\nOn Wednesday, oil prices ended over 4% higher as traders priced in the risk of supply disruptions amid tensions between the US and Iran and uncertainty over the war in Ukraine, after talks in Geneva ended without a breakthrough.\n\nOil futures edged up early Thursday, with US West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures trading around $65.30 per barrel at 1:04 a.m., while international benchmark Brent crude was around $70.50 per barrel.\n\nPrices of both grades are around 15% higher this year after three straight years of decline, reflecting a return of the geopolitical risk premium despite a global oil supply surplus.\n\nThe key reason for the disconnect is that much of the surplus has materialized as sanctioned crude \"stuck at sea,\" while inventories in key pricing hubs have remained stable, analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a Wednesday note.\n\nGoldman estimates the oil market ran a surplus of about 1.5 million barrels per day in 2025. Normally, that kind of oversupply would weigh heavily on prices.\n\nInstead, many tankers carrying sanctioned crude from Russia, Iran, and Venezuela are sitting at sea, using \"dark fleet\" and shadow shipping tactics to evade sanctions and keep oil moving.\n\nWhile that allows sanctioned oil to keep flowing, it also leaves more barrels lingering at sea, far from storage centers such as the US Gulf Coast and Northwest Europe — regions that anchor global crude pricing.\n\nSanctioned crude inventories on water have risen by around 130 million barrels from a year ago and now stand at roughly 375 million barrels, Goldman estimates. That accounts for about one-third of the increase in global crude inventories.\n\n\"Inventory builds matter less for prices when occurring on water,\" Goldman wrote, because traders discount barrels that may never reach key pricing hubs.\n\nThe buildup stemmed from weaker demand for sanctioned crude late last year, as India and China bought less Russian oil.\n\nThat softer demand reflected shifting geopolitical incentives, including changes in US trade policy, as well as expectations of steeper discounts or possible sanctions relief, the bank added.\n\n\"We assume that the pace of stockpiling moderates at sea but picks up on land,\" Goldman wrote.\n\nThe bank expects the share of oil inventory tied up offshore to fall from about 47% in 2025 to roughly 21% in 2026.\n\nHolding its global surplus estimate constant, Goldman's framework suggests that every 1 million barrels per day of sanctioned crude that piles up at sea for 12 months can lift Brent by as much as $8 per barrel.\n\nMeanwhile, every 100 million barrel reduction in oil stored offshore — as cargoes move into land-based inventories — could lower prices by $3 to $4.\n\nGoldman expects Brent to average $56 per barrel and WTI $52 in 2026, the bank's analysts wrote in a separate note on January 11.",

States, including California, have been among the main foils to various ⁠Trump administration policies, launching dozens of suits. California Attorney General Rob Bonta on Tuesday told Reuters about plans to ​sue over ​changes in vaccine policy and ​a plan to challenge ‌the rescission of a key Environmental Protection Agency finding, known as the endangerment finding, that was key to climate change regulation, for instance.\n\nThe new suit responds in part to California's loss of $1.2 billion in federal funding for ‌the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen ​Energy Systems, or ARCHES, Bonta ​said. The hydrogen plan ​was intended to replace fossil fuels in ‌utilities, public transit, trucking and ​ports.\n\nFederal agencies must ​execute laws, California said. \"It's as simple as Congress has the power of the purse, not the executive ​branch, and Congress ‌already appropriated this funding,\" Bonta said in an ​interview on Tuesday, ahead of the announcement.",

    "fullText": "PARIS (AP) — French authorities said Tuesday they released a tanker intercepted last month in the Mediterranean Sea which is suspected of being part of Russia’s sanctioned shadow fleet shipping oil in violation of international sanctions.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said in a post on X that the tanker Grinch is to leave French waters after having paid a penalty of “several million euros” and “three weeks of costly immobilization.”\n\n“Circumventing European sanctions comes at a price. Russia will no longer be able to finance its war with impunity through a ghost fleet off our coasts,” Barrot said.\n\nThe French military diverted the ship last month and anchored it in the port of Fos-sur-Mer as part of an investigation into a charge of failure to fly a valid flag. The crew of Indian nationality was being kept on board.\n\n“As part of a guilty plea procedure the company that owns the vessel was sentenced by the Marseille judicial court to a financial penalty of confiscation,” the Marseille prosecutor’s office and regional maritime authorities said in a joint statement.\n\nThe exact amount of the fine was not disclosed.\n\nRussia is believed to be using a fleet of over 400 ships to evade sanctions over its war against Ukraine. France and other countries have vowed to crack down.\n\nThe fleet comprises aging vessels and tankers owned by nontransparent entities with addresses in non-sanctioning countries, and sailing under flags from such countries.\n\nLast September, French naval forces boarded another oil tanker off the French Atlantic coast that President Emmanuel Macron also linked to the shadow fleet. Putin denounced that interception as an act of piracy.\n\nThat tanker’s captain is to go on trial next week over the crew’s alleged refusal to cooperate.",

    "description": "Technical analyst Brian Shannon advises investors to focus on less popular sectors like energy and utilities.",
    "fullText": "As Wall Street tries to move past the unexpected sell-off in software stocks that hit markets earlier this month, one strategist is urging investors to look outside tech altogether.\n\nIn a recent appearance on the The Noble Update Podcast, Brian Shannon — founder of the technical-analysis platform AlphaTrends — argued that the dominant era of the Magnificent 7 is fading.\n\n\"I don't want to short Microsoft but I certainly don't want to buy it,\" he told the podcast host, George Noble. \"It's dead money at best. Maybe it gets a bounce but there's bigger money flowing out of it on longer term time frames.\"\n\nShannon also ascribed the \"dead money\" label to Nvidia, highlighting what he sees as a lack of real growth. He also noted that the stock has essentially been stuck between $165 and $200 per share since August of 2025, and will likely stay around there.\n\nHe added that, in his view, other chipmakers such as Sandisk and Micron have taken Nvidia's mantle and have substantially outpaced it since August. But Shannon still cautions investors, using Sandisk's bull run to illustrate the trend of companies surging before a correction.\n\n\"When a pullback comes, don't be surprised if its drops to $450 over a three of four day period because that's what these stocks do,\" he noted. \"This is a big volatile beast and a lot of people are going to get burned by it by chasing it up here.\"\n\nShannon's views echo those held by Noble himself, who has been an outspoken AI bear in the past.\n\nNow that he's looking past the AI trade, Shannon sees more opportunity in overlooked sectors that many investors don't seem to be focused on: energy and utilities.\n\n\"Everyones obsessed with the tech stocks that are breaking down and that fact that bitcoin has been having a lot of difficulty,\" he stated. \"But there are places out there to make money. The energy names have been on fire, now the utilities. Things are not as bad as people always say.\"\n\nBoth Shannon and Noble highlighted the State Street Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF as a great way to gain exposure to the booming energy sector. Shannon advised investors who aren't invested in the fund yet to wait for a pullback but noted that he sees significant growth ahead for it.",

    "fullText": "Ukraine carried out long-range drone attacks overnight against a key Black Sea oil terminal and a plant making components for explosives located deep inside Russia, a security official told Business Insider on Tuesday.\n\nThe twin attacks mark Ukraine's latest long-range strikes and come as Kyiv's forces continue to target facilities inside Russia that directly and indirectly help the country sustain its full-scale invasion.\n\nDrones struck the Tamannaftogaz oil terminal in Russia's Krasnodar region, hitting one of the largest ports in the Black Sea region, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said. They were only authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.\n\nThe attack on the port, the second in less than a month, caused a fire at the facility, the source said, adding that the earlier Ukrainian drone strikes on January 22 damaged several tanks and pipelines at Tamannaftogaz, causing an estimated $50 million in losses. The facility is recognized as an important piece of Russian oil logistics in the Black Sea.\n\nThe source said that the SBU, Ukraine's main internal security agency, \"systematically\" targets Russia's energy and export infrastructure, striking at a major revenue source fueling Moscow's war efforts against its neighbor.\n\nSince August, Ukraine has intensified its long-range drone attacks on Russia's energy sector, striking oil refineries, terminals, tankers, and platforms across the country, and in the Black, Caspian, and even the Mediterranean seas.\n\nUkrainian officials have repeatedly described the deep-strike campaign as \"long-range sanctions\" on Moscow. The attacks have led to a slight decline in Russian oil refining over the past year.\n\nThe deep strikes have also targeted other infrastructure associated with Russian military operations, including factories, weapons storage facilities, and air bases.\n\nOvernight, for instance, Ukrainian drones struck the Metafrax Chemicals plant in the Perm region more than 1,600 kilometers (roughly 1,000 miles) inside Russia.\n\nThe sanctioned plant — one of the largest producers of methanol in Russia and Europe — is used to make chemical components for explosives and other military-related materials, the SBU source said. Several blasts were reported at the facility.\n\nIn a translated statement, the source said \"the SBU continues to systematically work on enterprises that provide the Russian military-industrial complex with raw materials and components for the production of weapons.\"\n\n\"The destruction of such objects reduces the pace of ammunition production, complicates the supply of resources for the army, and directly affects the reduction of the intensity of hostilities against Ukraine,\" they added.\n\nNeither Russia's defense ministry nor its US embassy responded to a request for comment on the attacks. Moscow said its air defenses shot down 334 Ukrainian fixed-wing drones over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe two attacks overnight on Monday were carried out by the SBU's Alpha group, an elite unit considered to be among the best of Ukraine's special forces.\n\nThe Alpha group is regularly behind long-range drone attacks against Russian targets. Forces within the unit also carry out ground operations, including in eastern Ukraine's embattled Donetsk region.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ukrainian military said on Tuesday that it had carried out an attack on the Ilsky oil refinery in Russia's Krasnodar region, which is not far from the Tamannaftogaz terminal that the SBU targeted.\n\n\"The defense forces of Ukraine will continue to systematically carry out measures aimed at weakening the combat potential of the Russian aggressor,\" the military said in a statement published to the Telegram messaging app.",

    "fullText": "Industry using ‘diversionary’ tactics, says analyst, as energy-hungry complex functions such as video generation and deep research proliferate\n\nTech companies are conflating traditional artificial intelligence with generative AI when claiming the energy-hungry technology could help avert climate breakdown, according to a report.\n\nMost claims that AI can help avert climate breakdown refer to machine learning and not the energy-hungry chatbots and image generation tools driving the sector’s explosive growth of gas-guzzling datacentres, the analysis of 154 statements found.\n\nThe research, commissioned by nonprofits including Beyond Fossil Fuels and Climate Action Against Disinformation, did not find a single example where popular tools such as Google’s Gemini or Microsoft’s Copilot were leading to a “material, verifiable, and substantial” reduction in planet-heating emissions.\n\nKetan Joshi, an energy analyst and author of the report, said the industry’s tactics were “diversionary” and relied on tried and tested methods that amount to “greenwashing”.\n\nHe likened it to fossil fuel companies advertising their modest investments in solar panels and overstating the potential of carbon capture.\n\n“These technologies only avoid a minuscule fraction of emissions relative to the massive emissions of their core business,” said Joshi. “Big tech took that approach and upgraded and expanded it.”\n\nMost of the claims that were scrutinised came from an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, which was reviewed by leading tech companies, and corporate reports from Google and Microsoft.\n\nThe IEA report – which devoted two chapters to the potential climate benefits of traditional AI – had a roughly even split between claims that rested on academic publications, corporate websites and those that had no evidence, according to the analysis. For Google and Microsoft, most claims lacked evidence.\n\nThe analysis, released during the AI Impact Summit in Delhi this week, argues the tech industry has misleadingly presented climate solutions and carbon pollution as a package deal by “muddling” types of AI.\n\nSasha Luccioni, AI and climate lead at Hugging Face, an open-source AI platform and community, who was not involved in the report, said it added nuance to a debate that often lumped very different applications together.\n\n“When we talk about AI that’s relatively bad for the planet, it’s mostly generative AI and large language models,” said Luccioni, who has pushed the industry to be more transparent about its carbon footprint.\n\n“When we talk about AI that’s ‘good’ for the planet, it’s often predictive models, extractive models, or old-school AI models.”\n\nGreen claims even for traditional AI tended to rely on weak forms of evidence that had not been independently verified, the analysis found. Only 26% of the green claims that were studied cited published academic research, while 36% did not cite evidence at all.\n\nOne of the earliest examples identified in the report was a widespread claim that AI could help mitigate 5-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.\n\nThe figure, which Google repeated as recently as April last year, came from a report it commissioned from BCG, a consulting firm, which cited a blogpost it wrote in 2021 that attributed the figure to its “experience with clients”.\n\nDatacentres consume just 1% of the world’s electricity but their share of US electricity is projected to more than double to 8.6% by 2035, according to BloombergNEF. The IEA predicts they will account for at least 20% of the rich world’s growth in electricity demand to the end of the decade.\n\nWhile the energy consumption of a simple text query to a large language model such as ChatGPT may be as little as running a lightbulb for a minute, partial industry disclosures suggest, it rises considerably for complex functions such as video generation and deep research, and has troubled some energy researchers with the speed and scale of its growth.\n\nA spokesperson for Google said: “Our estimated emissions reductions are based on a robust substantiation process grounded in the best available science, and we have transparently shared the principles and methodology that guide it.”\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment, while the IEA did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nJoshi said the discourse around AI’s climate benefits needed to be “brought back to reality”.\n\n“The false coupling of a big problem and a small solution serves as a distraction from the very preventable harms being done through unrestricted datacentre expansion,” he said.",

    "title": "Inside Dominik Szoboszlai’s main-character energy season, and the unavoidable Liverpool comparison",
    "description": "From a variety of roles, Szoboszlai has reached double figures for the season while looking a worthy inheritor of Steven Gerrard’s No 8 shirt and a future Liverpool captain",
    "fullText": "Mohamed Salah was speaking from a position of experience and expertise. “He is one of the best players in the world right now,” said a man who could have been described in such terms for much of the past decade. Many a Liverpool player in that time has been asked to eulogise about Salah. Now it may have been a sign of a shift in the pecking order at Anfield that he was being invited to praise Dominik Szoboszlai.\n\nSalah did, and willingly. While, when the Egyptian was dropped in November and the Hungarian took his spot on the right wing, they are friends, and when Szoboszlai has borrowed Salah’s yoga-inspired goal celebration against Barnsley, it was an affectionate tribute. Now, in another role reversal, Szoboszlai has outscored Salah.\n\nArne Slot has had his disagreements with Salah this season but, without going quite as far as the winger, said: “I think there are a lot of very good-to-elite football players in the world but I definitely agree with Mo that Dom is one of them.”\n\nA statistic may support that argument. Szoboszlai’s latest all-action display came against Brighton in the FA Cup but this season, only Kylian Mbappe has more goal contributions in the Champions League. He has eight, scoring four, assisting four. There are big contributions among them. Szoboszlai has a late winner against Inter in San Siro. He supplied Alexis Mac Allister for the only goal against Real Madrid. He took the corner for Virgil van Dijk’s injury-time decider against Atletico Madrid. He put Liverpool ahead in Marseille.\n\nNo wonder, then, that Salah said: “This season we rely on him so much.” There had been, however, a temptation to wonder if his status would slip this season, following the arrival of Florian Wirtz. Instead, he has started every Premier or Champions League game this season, apart from when he has been banned. It was evident Slot liked Szoboszlai in his debut year at Anfield; but it was notable, too, that the head coach said that, to play in midfield for Liverpool, you had to score goals. The Hungarian got too few, eight in 49 then.\n\n“When said that I maybe had to add that you need to run a lot if you play in the midfield for Liverpool,” said Slot now. “But I think what I meant was, as a No.10, you need to produce goals.”\n\nWhich Szoboszlai is now doing, but from a variety of roles. He reached double figures for the campaign on Saturday – equalling his best return for RB Leipzig – but the 10th came with a powerful surge from deep as a central midfielder. His spectacular free kicks against Arsenal and Manchester City each came when operating as a right-back. “He hasn’t always played in the No 10 position but is producing more and more goals,” noted Slot.\n\nPart of it stems from his set-piece expertise; so do his assists. Szoboszlai can take free kicks that Salah used to get or corners that, in previous years, would have gone to Trent Alexander-Arnold. He has long struck the ball in a way that exudes class. Now it brings more menace. More excitement, too: when striding forward but outside the box on Saturday, the Liverpool faithful were calling on him to shoot.\n\nWhen he does, he seems to be turning Liverpool’s goal-of-the-season award into a one-man contest. Their player of the year prize had already felt decided: Szoboszlai again. One comparison with Liverpool’s past could be Danny Murphy, their player of 2002-03 but in a disappointing campaign when too many others underachieved.\n\nYet the barnstorming run that brought his goal on Saturday and his ferocious long-range shooting are more reminiscent of perhaps Liverpool’s most iconic captain, who was also no stranger to starring as others struggled. “Actually, I am not playing a Steven Gerrard season although he was a legend for the club,” insisted Szoboszlai. “I try to do my own story.”\n\nEverything in it can revolve around him. He seems to have inherited some of Gerrard’s main-character energy. Szoboszlai has gone into overdrive in 2026. In his last nine games, he has five goals, two assists, one goal given away in ridiculous fashion against Barnsley and one red card. He was man of the match at Arsenal and, had Liverpool held on to their lead against Manchester City, probably would have received the award again. He has looked a worthy inheritor of Gerrard’s No 8 shirt.\n\nHe may yet get his armband. Szoboszlai looks a leader and a path to the captaincy is opening up. Alexander-Arnold left last summer, Andy Robertson may follow this, perhaps Salah too. Virgil van Dijk has 18 months left on his deal and is 34. Szoboszlai seems a possible successor.\n\n“He is still young,” warned Slot. “He has a lot of attributes already, especially when it comes to leading by example. There is still a step to make in terms of leadership, a voice in the dressing room if I compare him to Virgil, which is completely normal. Virgil is 34 and has seen [James] Milner, [Jordan] Henderson and these players, so it’s really good for Dominik that he sees Virgil.”\n\nBut when Salah sees Szoboszlai now, he believes he is watching one of the world’s best players. And that is a sign of what a stunning season the Hungarian is having.",

    "fullText": "The cost of electricity for New Jersey residents has risen more than 33% in just a two-year span.\n\nAs the New Jersey Globe reported, Gov. Mikie Sherrill is taking action to ease the burden.\n\nThe state elected Gov. Sherrill in 2025. Once she took office, she wasted no time making good on her campaign promise to tackle the energy affordability crisis. She declared a state of emergency and signed two executive orders at her inauguration aimed at lowering power costs.\n\nThe first order seeks to provide fast utility payment relief for consumers and prohibits providers from raising prices further.\n\nThe second lays out a plan to deal with the systemic power supply shortage that is driving the soaring prices. It includes building new power sources generated from in-state solar, battery storage, and nuclear energy.\n\n\"We must provide short-term relief and begin long-term reform,\" Sherrill wrote.\n\nIf you want to shield yourself from high electricity rates, consider switching your home's power over to solar. TCD's partners, like EnergySage, can help you think about the investment, find the best installer, and save up to $10,000 on solar projects.\n\nPower bills going up means just one more thing stretching people's budgets and making daily life more difficult.\n\nThe reasons behind such dramatic price increases are also important. In New Jersey, part of the supply shortage is due to the enormous demands of artificial intelligence data centers.\n\nOne grid operator — PJM — is responsible for powering New Jersey and a dozen other states. The group predicts the data center boom will contribute to peak demand rising 20% by 2030. Meanwhile, it is struggling to maintain its reserve capacity, the New Jersey Globe explained.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nThese trends threaten to push consumer costs even higher and make service more unreliable unless changes are made soon.\n\nSherrill's executive orders are the first steps toward solving the situation in New Jersey. On top of the new momentum they create for cheaper energy sources like solar, the orders also seek to reform the electric companies and how they treat large power users like data centers.\n\n\"Without the swift addition of new generation … the grid's reliability will be threatened during peak times,\" Sherrill wrote.\n\nGovernment support of cheaper energy sources is crucial to lower prices, but you can take matters into your own hands with home solar. Here are some more resources to help you get started:\n\n• EnergySage can help you save up to $10,000 on installations by curating competitive bids from local installers\n• Not ready to spend up front? Palmetto's $0-down LightReach solar leasing program can lower your utility rate by up to 20%\n• TCD's Solar Explorer makes it easy to access exclusive offers from preferred partners\n\nAdding energy-efficient appliances to a home powered by solar can lower energy costs even further. For example, check out how Mitsubishi can save you money with an upgraded HVAC system.\n\nLast but not least, there's up to $5,000 in rewards up for grabs in the free Palmetto Home app. You can take simple actions in your life to unlock the rewards and then spend them on home upgrades.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": ", Shariq Khan, Marianna Parraga and Arathy Somasekhar NEW YORK, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Valero Energy is set to buy up to 6.5 million barrels of Venezuelan crude in March bound for its Gulf",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Valero Energy is set to buy up to 6.5 million barrels of Venezuelan crude in March bound for its Gulf Coast refineries, making it the top foreign refiner of the OPEC country's oil ‌since the United States captured President Nicolas Maduro in January, sources said on Friday.\n\nWhat role is Valero playing in Venezuelan crude imports?\n\nWhat are Venezuela's current oil production and export levels?\n\nHow do recent U.S. sanctions changes affect Venezuelan oil?\n\nHow much Venezuelan oil revenue is under U.S. control?\n\nValero was among the first U.S. refiners to resume imports of ‌Venezuelan crude after the United States struck a flagship $2 billion oil supply deal with the country's interim government and began to ease sanctions. If Valero succeeds in snapping up 10 or more cargoes ​next month, equivalent to around 210,000 barrels per day, it could surpass U.S. oil major Chevron as the top U.S. refiner of Venezuelan crude.\n\nThat would also be the most Venezuelan crude oil Valero would process since the United States first sanctioned the country's oil industry in January 2019.\n\nChevron, the only U.S. major producing oil in Venezuela, is expected to boost exports of Venezuelan crude to some 300,000 bpd in March, from 220,000 bpd in January, sources told Reuters last month. Chevron typically refines up to half of ‌those exports at its own refineries, and sells the ⁠rest to other U.S. refiners.\n\nA large portion of Chevron's sales of Venezuelan oil to U.S. refiners typically goes to Valero. In March, Chevron is expected to supply Valero with most of the volume the refiner is planning to import, six sources said.\n\nValero ⁠has also negotiated some cargoes from trading houses including Trafigura, which were the first companies authorized by the U.S. government last month to join Chevron in trading Venezuelan oil.\n\nVitol has separately scheduled three naphtha cargoes to be delivered to Venezuela's state company PDVSA between February 22 and March 3, according to a shipping plan seen by Reuters.\n\nThe sources cautioned that ​loading ​schedules have not been finalized and are still subject to revision. They spoke on condition of ​anonymity to discuss confidential information.\n\nVitol and Trafigura declined to comment. ‌Chevron and PDVSA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nA Valero spokesperson referred to comments made by executive Randy Hawkins after its fourth-quarter earnings release on January 29. In those comments, Hawkins confirmed Valero was in talks with authorized sellers of Venezuelan crude and expected it to make up a \"pretty large part\" of its heavy-crude purchases in February and March.\n\nValero, which has the second-largest U.S. refining network capable of processing Venezuelan heavy oil, had a long-term supply agreement to buy crude from PDVSA before U.S. sanctions.",

    "title": "What the Fall of the Telegraph Says About Fossil Fuels",
    "description": "Renewables are positioned as the long-term winner over fossil fuels due to lower lifetime operating costs, faster deployment timelines, improving battery storage, and better demand-side management.",
    "fullText": "The global electric power business is changing. The economic hegemony of fossil fuels (and perhaps nuclear as well) is gradually being undermined by the adoption of renewable generating technologies such as solar and wind.  This economic and technological transition resembles warfare or a sporting event with distinct winners and losers. Our argument is based on a stunningly non-controversial premise—namely, that superior, lower-cost technologies producing an identical commodity eventually achieve dominance.\n\nLet’s look at a previous technology transition, from telegraph to telephones, to see if it offers clues about the present power-generating transition.\n\nAlexander Graham Bell received his telephone patent in the US in 1876. Universal phone service was on its way to being the accepted norm by the early 1900s. During this early period, telephone use was increasing, but so was that of the telegraph system, as the economy grew. Heavy commercial users depended on the information it carried, especially so in financial markets, railroads, newspapers, and the government. The original Wall Street ticker tape was a specialized form of telegraph. (The telegraph system, incidentally,  replaced the Pony Express, which took ten days to deliver messages from St. Joseph, Missouri to California.)\n\nThe telephone and telegraph, two competing technologies,  thrived side by side into the early part of the twentieth century,  although the growth in transcontinental phone service began around 1920 to eclipse the demand for telegraphy. The dominant telegraph provider Western Union, founded in 1851, lost ground in the post World War Two years and finalized its demise in the 1980s via unfortunate corporate restructurings and the addition of significant debt. However, the name itself still carried so much prestige and value that it remained in use until 2006 in the money transfer business.  These two competing communications technologies, telephony and telegraphy, existed and operated profitably side by side for decades, although one was gradually lapsing into technological irrelevance.\n\nRenewables, in our view, are the new dominant power-generating technology, analogous to telephones and fossil fuels will gradually fade thing like telegraph.\n\nRenewables will absolutely crush fossil fuels, over the long term, in electric generation because:\n\n1) Renewables will show a lower lifetime cost of operation (no fuel costs). This will be the game changer. (Okay, this is not so evident now. The projected all- in costs of renewables- with storage -and those of low -cost -fossil- fuel generation are close.  But fossil -fuel generation cost  is vulnerable to increases from fuel cost inflation, pollution controls, and environmental lawsuits that should be factored into any realistic long term scenario.) So, consider two power-generating sources, producing the same commodity,  only one of which, fossil fuels, has enormous lifetime (and probably increasing) fuel costs. The other technology has high initial build costs (we call these capital costs) and then produces electricity essentially for free, meaning it has relatively low operating expenses. We don’t think it’s a unique insight to call this an insurmountable competitive advantage. This is the whole game from an economic perspective right here. Everything else after this, as the sage said, is just commentary.\n\n2) Renewables can be deployed more rapidly: two-year new build time versus 5-6 for new gas-fired power generation and 10+ years for new nuclear power stations. Time is money, and the cost of capital tied up for years in a project gets passed on to consumers.\n\n3) Proliferation of batteries increases renewables penetration and begins to address the principal criticism against them, the intermittency of power production. Batteries provide storage capability, enhancing or offsetting the generating limitations of renewables. And in places like California, they are displacing natural gas-fired power generation as well.\n\n4) Demand side management (DSM) techniques are also improving for shifting electrical load and this only helps this transition. One benefit of large commercial electricity customers in a utility’s service area is that they are or can be extremely price sensitive and, as sophisticated customers, can be willing participants in DSM programs with the right incentives.\n\n5) Renewables produce less pollution and environmental degradation. Climate change concerns, however, in our view, have less to do with the emerging dominance of renewables than people realize. In contemporary slang, one might say “It’s all about the Benjamin’s, baby.”\n\nBut there is a further analogy between wholesale electricity power production and the transition from the telegraph to the telephone. The essence of the telegraph was short correspondence and data. Today we call those emails and faxes. We still communicate in a fairly similar fashion, but via a completely different conveyance system that’s digital and fiber optic. Similarly, the photo camera industry is mostly a relic, but people still love taking and sharing pictures, just now it’s with their phones. We don’t think electricity is any different in this respect. Electricity consumers of all types simply want affordable and reliable power, and they don’t care all that much about how it's made. Renewables, for the reasons cited, will produce electricity more cheaply (and more reliably) than fossil-fired competitors. For that reason, they will continue to take market share and increasingly displace fossil-fired generation in all power markets where they compete.\n\nIn the electricity business, fossil-fired power generation, to remain dominant,  needs superior technology and the ability to undercut competitors on price. Our fossil fuel industry today possesses neither. Its costs will rise more or less at the rate of inflation not counting the increasing volatility of natural gas markets. Renewables, on the other hand, are a technology where costs are declining with new scientific advances in things like battery materials and solar panel efficiency. To us, this type of economic competition is like a war in which only one party emerges victorious. The fossil fuel industry may have already lost.\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",

    "description": "A Pentagon plan to use a high-energy, counter-drone laser without having coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration about potential risks to civilian flights prompted Wednesday’s unprecedented airspace shutdown over El Paso, Texas, multiple sources tell CNN.",
    "fullText": "A Pentagon plan to use a high-energy, counter-drone laser without having coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration about potential risks to civilian flights prompted Wednesday’s unprecedented airspace shutdown over El Paso, Texas, multiple sources told CNN.\n\nA source familiar with the timeline of events said that the US military used the laser technology to shoot down four mylar balloons this week, contributing to the decision by the FAA to shut down local airspace.\n\nThose accounts come as the Trump administration has claimed that a Mexican cartel drone crossing into US airspace is what triggered the 10-mile restriction centered on El Paso International Airport.\n\nLate Tuesday, the FAA abruptly issued a temporary flight restriction that immediately grounded all flights up to 18,000 feet around the city for 10 days, effectively shutting down El Paso International Airport.\n\nRoughly eight hours later, the restriction was lifted. By the time the FAA had lifted the flight restrictions, airlines had already issued travel waivers and notified customers of potential changes.\n\nMultiple sources from the federal government and US airlines told CNN that military activity near El Paso, including US drones monitoring cartel operations and the Pentagon’s planned use of a high-energy laser designed to counter drones, raised immediate concerns for civilian traffic arriving and departing El Paso International Airport. Fort Bliss and its airfield, Biggs Army Airfield, sit just north of the commercial airport, which serves about 100 flights each day.\n\nFAA and Pentagon officials had been scheduled to meet February 20 to review potential impacts and mitigation measures for a test of the laser system, a technology the Pentagon has been testing in more remote areas of the country, multiple sources said. But the Defense Department sought to use the system sooner around El Paso, prompting the FAA to impose the temporary flight restriction until that coordination could occur. The 10-day restriction would have expired on February 21, one day after DoD and the FAA were set to meet.\n\nThe FAA’s decision to close the airspace was made without telling the White House first, according to people familiar with the matter. The issue became a topic of intense focus inside the West Wing in the early morning hours of Wednesday, as Texas lawmakers pressed for answers on why the airspace was suddenly closed without first alerting them.\n\nAn administration official said Wednesday morning that the shutdown was triggered by Defense Department “action to disable” cartel drones. It’s unclear if the presence of drones might have led to the acceleration of the deployment of the laser system.\n\nCNN reached out to the FAA and White House for comment about the differing explanations. The Pentagon on Wednesday continued to refer to the administration official’s statement about a drone breach having caused the airspace closure.\n\nSecretary of Transportation Sean Duffy posted to social media crediting the FAA and Defense Department with acting “swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion.”\n\n“The threat has been neutralized, and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region,” he wrote on X.\n\nIncursions along the southern border are extremely common and historically do not prompt such airspace closures. In 2024, for example, Air Force Gen. Greg Guillot, the commander of NORTHCOM, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the number of incursions along the US Mexico border was “over a thousand” each month.\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration and other US security agencies have used facilities at the Biggs Army Airfield for years as part of efforts to monitor Mexico-based drug cartel operations, current and former US officials said.\n\nEl Paso, with a population of nearly 700,000, is the sixth-largest city in Texas and one of the 25 largest in the United States. It is a hub of cross-border commerce alongside neighboring Ciudad Juárez in Mexico.\n\nNearly 3.5 million passengers passed through El Paso International Airport in the first 11 months of 2025, according to its website. The airport describes itself as the gateway to West Texas, southern New Mexico and northern Mexico.\n\nThe US military has been testing laser-based air defenses against drones in recent months. Last summer, the Army conducted a live-fire exercise using directed energy weapons alongside more traditional air defense systems at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. And last fall, the Army put out a request to industry for ideas on a counter-drone Enduring-High Energy Laser (E-HEL) weapon system.\n\nIn the initial flight restrictions, the FAA classified the area around El Paso﻿ as “(National) Defense Airspace” and said pilots who violated the restriction could be intercepted, detained and questioned by law enforcement.\n\nIt warned that additional actions could be taken for pilots who don’t adhere to the restrictions, including suspension of flight certifications, criminal charges, and that the US government “may use deadly force” if an aircraft poses an “imminent security threat.”\n\nThe sudden FAA restrictions seemed to catch pilots and air traffic controllers by surprise.\n\nAudio from LiveATC.net caught the moment pilots were made aware of the grounding.\n\n“Just pass it on to everybody else, at 06:30 for the next 10 days, we’re all at a ground stop,” a controller said.\n\nA pilot replied, “OK, ground stop 06:30 for how long?”\n\n“Ten days,” the controller replied.\n\n“So the airport is totally closed?” the pilot said, chuckling.\n\nThe controller replied, “Apparently, we just got informed about 30 minutes to an hour ago.”\n\n“So for 10 days you guys are not open,” the pilot said, in disbelief.\n\n“Well, we’ll be here, but no air traffic,” the controller said.\n\n“OK,” the pilot said while laughing.\n\nSamuel, a traveler in El Paso, told CNN affiliate KFOX he was doing a book tour with a client and didn’t get any notification from his airline.\n\n“I just kind of saw all the cops here and the news cameras,” he said. “I gotta figure out what’s going on if there’s another airport that’s not in El Paso, and try to figure out and rent a car out.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas told reporters Wednesday that the closure of the El Paso International Airport was solely a FAA decision and that local officials — including members of Congress — were left completely in the dark before it happened.\n\nShe stressed that she was not notified in advance despite representing the congressional district that’s home to the airport, Fort Bliss and the broader El Paso community.\n\n“They did not alert the El Paso city manager or the El Paso mayor,” Escobar said on a press call Wednesday morning. “Everyone locally on the ground was in the dark, and the impact, obviously, is highly consequential.”\n\nThe Associated Press and CNN’s Evan Perez, Kevin Liptak, Kit Mayer, Camila DeChalus, Karina Tsui, and Diego Mendoza contributed to this report.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.",

Who knows if this is the right one, but we won’t know until we actually do the deep dive, have the discussions and figure out what’s best for our constituents,” said Harris of Senate Bill 954 that he is sponsoring.\n\nThe bill, which lays out a pathway for investor-owned electric utilities to use ratepayer dollars to build power generation infrastructure in Maryland, has the support of Exelon — the owner of Baltimore Gas & Electric, Delmarva Power and Pepco. The Chicago-based utility has been campaigning hard for the idea, including in TV commercials that aired in Maryland during the Super Bowl.\n\nBut consumer advocates and environmental groups argue that putting additional costs on the backs of customers would be deeply harmful amid already-high costs. They warn that high infrastructure spending by utilities is part of the reason for the current high rates, and allowing further construction would make matters worse.\n\nMaryland People’s Counsel David Lapp, who is tasked with representing utility ratepayers in the state, said in a statement that he believes “the Exelon bill is anything but affordable.”\n\n“Turning new business over to Exelon unnecessarily exposes customers to the Exelon utilities’ long record of exceeding cost projections and of cost overruns,” Lapp said.\n\nIn Maryland, the utilities, which control the distribution of power to homes and businesses across the state, are separate from the companies that generate power and supply it to the grid.\n\nThe utilities enjoy monopolies in their service territories and are regulated by the Public Service Commission, which presides over the costs they can pass on to customers. Utilities receive reimbursement of approved infrastructure costs, and a guaranteed profit on top of that, often 9% or higher.\n\nCurrent law technically states that the PSC “may require or allow investor-owned electric company to construct, acquire, or lease, and operate, its own generating facilities … subject to appropriate cost recovery.”\n\nHarris’ bill is considerably more specific.\n\nThe bill directs the PSC to require one or more electric companies to submit plans involving power generation, if it determines that there is a power scarcity, or that an event impacting “price stability” has occurred. The commission then has one year to approve or deny the plans.\n\nHarris said that his bill, called the Affordable Energy Act, would only allow the utilities to build renewable energy projects, but not fossil fuel projects.\n\nValencia McClure, senior vice president of government, regulatory and external affairs for Exelon’s Maryland utilities, said her company wants to focus on operating community solar farms and battery storage infrastructure, not natural gas generation. She noted that power customers who \n\n“We really are focusing on: How can we support our customers during this affordability crisis?” McClure said. “The way to do that is to — if called upon by the state — to be able to build new generation.”\n\nBut Lapp said Maryland consumers should not be paying for any increased power generation in the state through their rates, since much of the predicted strain on the regional grid isn’t actually coming from Maryland. It’s largely coming from data centers projected for other states, he said.\n\nHouse caps amount of utility employee salaries that can come out of ratepayers’ pockets\n\n“PJM projects that the Maryland Exelon utilities’ power demands decrease — not increase — through 2029.” Lapp wrote. “Aside from some relatively small data center growth in Maryland compared to PJM — growth that existing customers should not be responsible for — the Exelon utilities’ energy demands only go up modestly starting in 2030, at a growth rate much lower than historical growth rates.”\n\nHarris’ bill explicitly states that the electric utilities required or authorized to construct power facilities can recover all of their costs from ratepayers — even if some of those costs are stranded, including if the infrastructure is never built.\n\n“That’s one of the things that we would be discussing further and see what is actually needed and what is not needed,” Harris said.\n\nLapp argues that the provision is alarming.\n\n“It would give utilities unprecedented statutory protection from the consequences of building power plants that turn out to be unnecessary — a real possibility given the vast evidence suggesting that projections of data center energy demands are inflated,” Lapp wrote.\n\nIn a statement, BGE spokesperson Nick Alexopulos said the company supports the measure “to make sure a large generation project doesn’t jeopardize the utility’s health or lead to higher debt costs overall, which would adversely impact customers.”\n\nIt’s unclear whether the bill will be able to advance: Senate President Bill Ferguson said Tuesday that “there is a level of skepticism that exists across the caucus, and across the Senate membership” about whether it will reduce ratepayer costs.\n\n“That’s going to be the lens that we are really trying to hone in on, is whether or not a policy is going to provide long-term savings for the ratepayer,” Ferguson said.\n\nMcClure said Exelon estimates that average customer bills would increase about $2 per month for a few years, but those would turn to savings of $5 to $10 a month in the future. The company’s analysis was based on construction of 2,700 megawatts of battery storage and 1,200 megawatts of solar.\n\nFerguson said that he would “prefer that that the risk” of investment “land with investors.”\n\nSUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE\n\n“But there is a question that if there is a strike price or point where … the market is not generating sufficient domestic generation, whether that has to be some other market intervention to push it,” Ferguson said.\n\nLast year, lawmakers passed the Next Generation Energy Act, which included a fast-track permitting process for “dispatchable” energy projects, which can provide energy for the grid when called upon during peak times. Only two projects have been approved to move through the fast-track, under the legislation’s requirements: Two different concepts for a natural gas plant in Harford County, submitted by Constellation.\n\nConstellation, formerly an Exelon subsidiary, also proposed a battery storage project, but it did not meet requirements of the fast-track bill, even though it created a procurement specifically for battery storage.\n\nConstellation has been opposed to Exelon’s push to enter the generation game, arguing that it would crowd out competitive power producers, and that Exelon is ill-suited to enter the generation fray.\n\n“BGE doesn’t need new law to build new generation,” said Constellation spokesman Paul Adams. “BGE wants new law to guarantee a return on any investment, whether or not that investment is in the best interests of Maryland ratepayers or at the lowest cost. Unlike them, Constellation is ready and willing to put our own capital on the line, with no guarantee of profit. It seems only reasonable that if you aren’t willing to take on any risk, you should take no profit.”",

    "description": "International team creates quick-charging, long-lasting prototype with potential for renewable energy storage",
    "fullText": "A little-known fact: In the year 1900, electric cars outnumbered gas-powered ones on the American road.\n\nThe lead-acid auto battery of the time, courtesy of Thomas Edison, was expensive and had a range of only about 30 miles. Seeking to improve on this, Edison believed the nickel-iron battery was the future, with the promise of a 100-mile range, a long life and a recharge time of seven hours, fast for that era.\n\nAlas, that promise never reached fruition. Early electric car batteries still suffered from serious limitations, and advances in the internal combustion engine won the day.\n\nNow, an international research collaboration co-led by UCLA has taken a page from Edison’s book, developing nickel-iron battery technology that may be well-suited for storing energy generated at solar farms. The prototype was able to recharge in only seconds, instead of hours, and achieved over 12,000 cycles of draining and recharging — the equivalent of more than 30 years of daily recharges.\n\nThe technology was built from tiny clusters of metal patterned using proteins that were then bonded to a two-dimensional material, made of sheets only one atom thick. Despite the innovative ingredients, the techniques are deceptively straightforward and inexpensive.\n\n“People often think of modern nanotechnology tools as complicated and high-tech, but our approach is surprisingly simple and straightforward,” said study co-author Maher El-Kady, an assistant researcher in the UCLA College’s chemistry and biochemistry department. “We are just mixing common ingredients, applying gentle heating steps and using raw materials that are widely available.”\n\nThe study was published in the journal Small and is featured on the back cover.\n\nThe natural world provided some cues for the researchers. Of particular interest was the process by which animals form bones and shellfish form their hard outer casings. Whether skeletons are inside or outside, they’re made by proteins that act as scaffolds for collecting calcium-based compounds.\n\nThe researchers sought to mimic this mechanism to generate their tiny clusters of nickel or iron, according to co-corresponding author Ric Kaner, a distinguished professor of chemistry and biochemistry in the UCLA College and of materials science and engineering in the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering.\n\n“We were inspired by the way nature deposits these types of materials,” said Kaner, who is also the holder of the Dr. Myung Ki Hong Endowed Chair in Materials Innovation and a member of the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA. “Laying down minerals in the correct fashion builds bones that are strong, yet flexible enough to not be brittle. How it’s done is almost as important as the material used, and proteins guide how they are placed.”\n\nIn the study, the team used proteins that are byproducts of beef production. The molecules served as templates for growing clusters of nickel for positive electrodes and iron for negative electrodes. The nooks and crannies in the folded protein structure limited the size of the metal clusters to fewer than 5 nanometers. That’s so small that it would take about 10,000 to 20,000 clusters to match the width of a human hair. The researchers even detected single atoms of iron and nickel in their electrodes.\n\nThe proteins were combined with graphene oxide, an ultrathin 2D material that comes in sheets a single atom thick comprising carbon decorated with oxygen atoms. While the oxygen can create clogs that make the material act more like an insulator, the process that followed changed everything.\n\nThe ingredients were superheated in water then baked at high-temperature, causing the proteins to char into carbon, stripping away the oxygen in the 2D material and embedding the tiny metal clusters guided by the proteins. The resulting structure was an aerogel, made of almost 99% air by volume.\n\nPart of the technology’s secret sauce is surface area — the more exposed, the more space for the reactions behind battery chemistry to take place.\n\nThere was plenty of such room provided by the graphene aerogel’s thinness and surplus of empty space. And the tininess of the metal nanoclusters takes advantage of a fundamental mathematical principle: as objects get smaller, the size of the exposed outer surface increases far more than volume does.\n\n“As we go from larger particles down to these extremely tiny nanoclusters, the surface area gets dramatically higher,” El-Kady said. “That’s a huge advantage for batteries. When the particles are that tiny, almost every single atom can participate in the reaction. So, charging and discharging happen way faster, you can store more charge, and the whole battery just works more efficiently.”\n\nDespite its advantages in charging speed and durability, this iteration of the technology does not match the storage capabilities of today’s lithium-ion batteries. With range at a premium in the electric car market, the researchers think that this Edison-inspired battery of the future may one day find application in other areas.\n\nFor instance, the technology’s fast charging, high output and robust endurance suggest a good fit for storing excess electricity generated at solar farms during the daytime, to power the grid at night. It may also be useful for backup power at data centers.\n\n“Because this technology could extend the lifetime of batteries to decades upon decades, it might be ideal for storing renewable energy or quickly taking over when power is lost,” El-Kady said. “This would remove worries about the changing cost of infrastructure.”\n\nThe researchers are exploring the use of their nanocluster fabrication technique with other metals. They’re also looking at possible replacements for bovine proteins, such as natural polymers that are more abundant, and thus less expensive and easier to scale up for future manufacturing.\n\nThe study’s first author is Habibeh Bishkul of Tarbiat Modares University in Tehran, Iran. Abolhassan Noori and Mir Mousavi of Tarbiat Modares University served as co-corresponding authors. Other co-authors are Nahla Mohamed of UCLA and Cairo University in Egypt; Mohammad Rahmanifar of Shahed University in Tehran; Nasim Hassani of Razi University in Kermanshah, Iran; Mehdi Neek-Amal of Shahid Rajaee Teacher Training University in Tehran and the University of Antwerp in Belgium; and Junlei Liu and Cheng Zhang of Zheijang University of Technology in Hangzhou, China.\n\nThe study received funding from the Iran National Science Foundation, the National Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, Nanotech Energy Inc., a University of California Climate Action Seed Grant and the Tarbiat Modares University Research Council.",

    "fullText": "OKLAHOMA CITY (KFOR) — As major energy companies announce plans to move their headquarters from Oklahoma City to Houston, experts say the reasons may have less to do with what Oklahoma is doing wrong and more about publicly-traded companies’ priority to serve shareholders above others.\n\nExperts say that while there are certain things the state can improve upon, in the case of Devon Energy and Expand Energy, the deck was already stacked against Oklahoma outside of the state’s control.\n\n“The joke around my part of the city is that we’d rather live in Oklahoma City because we have less traffic, better weather, and a better basketball team,” Former Oklahoma City University Business School Dean Steve Agee told News 4.\n\nExpand Energy to move headquarters to Houston\n\nAgee said he believes the moves can mostly be blamed on the fact that Devon and Expand are publicly-traded companies, which prioritize shareholders before their communities, employees, or customers.\n\n“I think we all have to step back and make sure that we understand corporations like this are in business to make money and they’re in business to provide good returns for their shareholders,” Agee said.\n\n“Devon and Expand are thinking that—in order to enhance shareholder value—a move like this would probably be the appropriate thing to do,” Agee said.\n\nOver the past decade, other publicly-traded energy companies have also moved to Houston, including ExxonMobil, leaving the Dallas–Fort Worth area, and Chevron leaving California.\n\nWalt Duncan, president of privately-held Oklahoma City-based Duncan Oil Properties, said publicly traded companies often want to position themselves near each other to serve as a one-stop shop for industry analysts.\n\n“The public companies want to have as much coverage as they can by industry analysts,” Duncan said. “And so, you know, most of these analysts are coming out of New York. You know, if they can stop in one city and, you know, hit 20 different companies that they have to cover, that’s much easier for them.”\n\nDuncan said boards overseeing Devon and Expand have included fewer and fewer Oklahomans over the years, leaving fewer leaders with ties to the community.\n\nIt’s different for privately-held companies like Continental Resources—soon to be Oklahoma City’s largest remaining energy company.\n\nState and local leaders react to Devon and Coterra merger\n\nContinental Resources CEO Harold Hamm told The Oklahoman Monday he’s committed to keeping the company in Oklahoma.\n\n“I don’t have any concern that Continental being private is ever going to is ever going to want to go to Houston,” Duncan said. “You really do have to think about it, and you have to take sort of the executive management team, I do not know very many people in the industry, you know, kind of rank and file, that I have ever heard of being excited to move to Houston.”",

    "fullText": "Push to restart uranium mining in Patagonia has sparked fears about the environmental impact and loss of sovereignty over key resources\n\nOn an outcrop above the Chubut River, one of the few to cut across the arid Patagonian steppe of southern Argentina, Sergio Pichiñán points across a wide swath of scrubland to colourful rock formations on a distant hillside.\n\n“That’s where they dug for uranium before, and when the miners left, they left the mountain destroyed, the houses abandoned, and nobody ever studied the water,” he says, citing suspicions arising from cases of cancer and skin diseases in his community. “If they want to open this back up, we’re all pretty worried around here.”\n\nPichiñán lives in Cerro Cóndor, a hamlet with a sparse Indigenous Mapuche population due to the area’s harsh summers, cold winters and little rain. The National Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA) mined uranium here in the 1970s and it is now in focus as President Javier Milei aims to shift Argentina’s nuclear strategy.\n\nThe remote region sees few visitors, but in November, a delegation from the International Atomic Energy Agency visited as part of an Integrated Uranium Production Cycle Review. Cerro Solo, adjacent to the shuttered mines, is one of CNEA’s largest proven uranium deposits, and restarting mining of the ore is the first step in Milei’s new nuclear plan.\n\nThe others are to develop small modular reactors, use them to power AI datacentres, export reactors and uranium, and partially privatise Nucleoeléctrica, the state-owned nuclear energy utility.\n\nYet the plan is facing fierce criticism from both pro- and anti-nuclear voices. Argentina’s non-military nuclear programme is 75 years old. It exports research reactors that produce isotopes for medical radiology and science, and its three nuclear plants – Atucha I and II and Embalse – provide about 5% of the country’s electricity.\n\nUranium production in Chubut declined in the 1980s, and the mines were closed in the 1990s; since another closed in Mendoza in 1997, Argentina has imported uranium, so many see restarting uranium extraction as a strategic move.\n\nAdriana Serquis, a nuclear physicist, is not so sure. She was president of CNEA until 2024 and was recently elected to congress. She says: “The plan doesn’t seem oriented toward supplying our own plants, but rather exporting uranium directly to the US. It would appear the objective is to satisfy others’ needs while destroying our own capabilities.”\n\nDioxitek, a state-run subsidiary of CNEA, processes imported uranium into uranium dioxide for use in Argentina’s power stations, but signed a commitment in August last year with the US-based Nano Nuclear Energy to supply it with uranium hexafluoride. As Argentina’s reactors run on natural or low-enriched uranium oxide rather than uranium hexafluoride, it is likely that any uranium extracted in Argentina would be exported to the US rather than be used for local energy production.\n\nIn parallel, Nano Nuclear Energy signed a memorandum of understanding with the British-Argentinian company UrAmerica, which has large holdings in Chubut and plans to mine uranium. One of the stated goals of the agreement is “strengthening US energy security by sourcing materials for nuclear fuel from a reliable partner”.\n\nDiego Hurtado, ex-president of the national nuclear regulatory authority and former CNEA vice-president, says Argentina’s proven uranium reserves would fulfil domestic demand for about 70 years, though less if nuclear energy were expanded.\n\n“Argentina doesn’t have extra uranium,” he says. “Exporting uranium isn’t an Argentine nuclear plan; it’s banana republic-style mining: ‘I’ll sell you raw materials so you can use them to generate employment and industrial capacity in your country instead of here.’”\n\nThe nuclear plan signifies a realignment towards Washington by Milei, who has declared his country to be an “unconditional ally of the US”. In September, the far-right president signed Argentina up as the first Latin American member of the US Foundational Infrastructure for the Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology (First) programme.\n\nHurtado says Argentina has little to gain from the arrangement. “Since the late 60s, the US has systematically tried to undermine Argentina’s nuclear development,” he says. “They treat Latin America as their back yard and don’t want competitors for their technology here.”\n\nDuring his tenure at CNEA, Hurtado met US nuclear specialists who put pressure on Argentina to reject the Chinese Hualong One reactor, which was lined up to be the country’s fourth nuclear power station. Milei has suspended this project.\n\nSerquis, at a recent forum on national sovereignty in Patagonia, said of the situation: “The hegemonic model of countries like the US or European countries, that have achieved certain technologies, says ‘Once I’ve gone up the ladder, I knock it down so no one else comes up.’”\n\nOther parts of the plan have also drawn criticism. Small modular reactors (SMRs) are at the forefront of nuclear energy development. To date, there are only two in operation – one in China and one in Russia.\n\nArgentina has been developing an SMR, known as Carem, for decades, with construction under way since 2014. In 2024, the OECD’s Nuclear Energy Agency surveyed 52 SMR projects worldwide and listed Carem as among the four most advanced. Argentina has invested more than £560m, and estimates show the project is about two-thirds complete.\n\nYet the Milei administration has declared it a failure and in effect mothballed it. The new plan focuses instead on a new SMR project, the ACR300, at only 1% of development, just patented by an Argentinian state-run company but through its subsidiary in the US.\n\n“Not only have they stopped investing in the project, but all the engineering and research teams are being dismantled,” Serquis says. “They say they’re going to have four SMRs built in five years, and that’s just fiction.”\n\nAll this comes in the context of Milei’s chainsaw-style dismemberment of public research and environmental protection agencies. “Milei took office with a potent discourse of stigmatising science and technology, and rapidly defamed them across the board, from CNEA to the National Water Institute to the National Weather Service to public universities,” Hurtado says. “It’s catastrophic.”\n\nTrade unions claim that between 80% and 90% of CNEA workers receive salaries below the poverty line – increasing emigration and brain drain. In 2024, the country’s secretariat for innovation, science and technology only spent 7% of its allocated budget. Public universities have seen budgets slashed.\n\nPartially privatising the public nuclear utility, Nucleoeléctrica, sets off other alarm bells. The plan, formally launched by the economy ministry in November, aims to sell 44% of the state company to a private investor. Although not holding an absolute majority, the buyer would have the largest stake, giving them decision-making control.\n\nDemian Reidel, Milei’s lead on nuclear matters, was the chair of the council of presidential advisers until being appointed as head of Nucleoeléctrica, where he is now facing a scandal about the company’s procurement and alleged overpricing of service and software contracts.\n\nHe did not respond to requests for comment, but has described the privatisation as “what any normal company does to attract investment”.\n\nNucleoeléctrica, however, is one of the few state companies in Argentina that runs a budget surplus, posting a record 17.2bn pesos (£8.6m) in the first quarter of 2025. Opposition parties in congress proposed a bill to declare Nucleoeléctrica a strategic priority and prevent privatisation, but they are likely to lack the two-thirds majority to override Milei’s presidential veto.\n\nIsidro Baschar, a former member of the company’s directorate, says Argentina risks losing strategic capacities and reaping no benefit from privatisation, noting that nuclear power worldwide is overwhelmingly state-run (though most commercial plants are privately owned in the US).\n\n“Nuclear energy combines critical infrastructure, extremely long-term investments, highly specialised licensing and international commitments regarding security and non-proliferation. None of that can be sustained through market logic alone,” he says.\n\nSerquis, Hurtado, and Baschar all highlight nuclear power, alongside the solar potential in the high, dry provinces of the north-west and Patagonia’s strong winds, as key elements for meeting emissions-reduction goals and fighting the climate crisis.\n\nMilei is a known climate denier, calling global heating “a socialist lie”, and wants new nuclear plants not to replace fossil fuels but to attract more demand. He and Reidel have visited Silicon Valley and various industry conferences to pitch Argentina, and Patagonia in particular, to investors as a prime site for nuclear-powered AI datacentres.\n\nBaschar says: “Projecting datacentres, or ‘nuclear cities’, in Patagonia seems attractive in the ideas lab, but it’s politically non-viable. [Patagonia] is the region of the country with the strongest popular rejection of these endeavours.”\n\nChubut has a broad-based and deeply entrenched grassroots anti-mining movement. A 2003 referendum on open-pit gold-mining received an 81% “no” vote, leading to a law prohibiting the practice throughout the province. In 2021, lawmakers tried to open the central steppe to mining but withdrew after protesters blocked highways, swarmed the capital and set fire to government buildings.\n\nThe anti-nuclear movement goes back to the 1980s, when a radioactive waste dump was proposed near Gastre, a remote village in central Chubut. After years of popular opposition scuttled the project, cities and towns across Patagonia passed anti-nuclear ordinances banning the presence or transit of nuclear materials.\n\nNow, near the old mine sites in central Chubut, tens of thousands of tonnes of old uranium tailings sit behind only a chain-link fence and a sign that says “Restricted Area”.\n\nOrlando Carriqueo, spokesperson for the Mapuche-Tehuelche parliament of Río Negro, an Indigenous organisation in another Patagonian province, says public opinion in the region is concerned about the consequences of uranium mining for fuel production and about waste management. “We’re being turned into an energy colony,” he says.\n\nReports by CNEA over the past three administrations show no radiation monitoring at the site. Less than a kilometre away, the Río Chubut flows past on its way to supply drinking water to the towns of Trelew, Gaiman and Rawson on the Atlantic coast.\n\nPichiñán, riding his horse past the abandoned mines, says he fears that future generations could be deluded by the same broken promises of the past. “What happened back then, when they told us we were going to be rich? Where’s all that wealth? Where are the people who were going to have work and money?” he asks.\n\n“I don’t want my child to be 30, 40 years old one day and have to show them this kind of abandonment,” he says. “Whatever happens, we can’t let them do this.”",

    "description": "Bolt Data and Energy was recently cofounded by Eric Schmidt and raised $150 million. Now it's in talks to have Google anchor Texas campus.",
    "fullText": "Bolt Data and Energy, a data center development firm that was cofounded late last year by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, is negotiating a deal that would allow it to begin construction on a large data center project it is planning in West Texas.\n\nSchmidt's firm is in discussions with Google, his former employer, according to two people with direct knowledge of the talks. The tech giant, one of the leaders in the race to develop and commercialize artificial intelligence, is considering a commitment of 250 megawatts, according to one of the people. The other person said it was too early to characterize the exact size of the potential transaction because it was still under discussion.\n\nThe sources spoke on the condition of anonymity because the potential transaction is still being arranged and the talks are confidential.\n\n\"We don't comment on rumors,\" a Google spokeswoman told Business Insider, declining to comment further. Google announced last year that it plans to build $40 billion of cloud and AI infrastructure in Texas by 2027.\n\nThe potential deal highlights how Big Tech is racing to secure the power, physical infrastructure, and land needed to fuel AI, even as the costs and financial risks of those bets loom.\n\nIn December, Bolt completed its first funding round, raising $150 million from investors, including $50 million from Texas Pacific Land Corporation, a public company that owns large tracts of land in West Texas. As part of the investment from TPL, Bolt will develop data centers on land in TPL's portfolio.\n\nA presentation detailing Bolt's development plans, shared with Business Insider, said that TPL's land would give it access to abundant power and water for cooling. These commodities have become increasingly strained as data center development has boomed around the country.\n\nThe presentation states that Bolt's development would begin with an \"initial 250 megawatt facility\" and expand in 250-500 megawatt increments into a 5 gigawatt campus.\n\nBolt's plan is one of several large-scale projects that have been envisioned in Texas to cater to the AI race. Fermi, a public company co-founded by former Texas governor and US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, has plans for an 11-gigawatt campus in Amarillo.\n\nIn December, Business Insider revealed that Amazon had pulled back a $150 million cash advance it had pledged as part of a preliminary deal to anchor the project. Fermi's disclosure of the reimbursement of that advance caused its stock to fall by 50%. Fermi's CEO, Toby Neugebauer, told Business Insider that although Amazon had reclaimed its advance, the negotiations for it to take space with Fermi were still ongoing.\n\nMajor bank lenders who extended $38 billion to finance the construction of data center campuses in Shackleford County, Texas, and Port Washington, Wisconsin, for Oracle and OpenAI, meanwhile, have had difficulty selling off pieces of the huge loan to other banks and investors. Those troubles stem, in part, from worries about whether Oracle's credit will be strained by its massive AI spending.\n\nTo help allay concerns, Oracle announced it would raise as much as $50 billion in debt and equity in 2026 to continue to pursue its AI buildout while also maintaining \"a solid investment-grade balance sheet.\"\n\nLast week, Alphabet, Google's parent company, revealed in its fourth-quarter earnings report that it plans to spend between $175 and $185 billion on capital expenditures in 2026, roughly double its outlay in 2025. The spending is being done largely to pay for AI equipment and infrastructure.\n\nA record wave of spending has been announced by big technology companies on AI this year, including Amazon's disclosure during its earnings last week that it would spend $200 billion alone this year.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "Does Higher VO₂ Max Make You More Attractive?",
    "description": "Cardiovascular fitness changes your nervous system, your skin, your energy, and the way you show up in a room. The research on why fitter people seem more magnetic has less to do with appearance than you'd think.",
    "fullText": "A friend said something to me recently that I haven't been able to stop thinking about. We were talking about someone we both knew who had started running consistently about a year ago. She said, \"He just seems different now. More present. Calmer. I don't know—more attractive?\"\n\nShe couldn't put her finger on what had changed. It wasn't that he'd lost a dramatic amount of weight or suddenly developed a model's jawline. Something more subtle had shifted. The way he carried himself. The steadiness in conversation. A kind of groundedness that wasn't there before.\n\nI've noticed this pattern in myself, too. After months of consistent training, the changes that people comment on aren't the ones I expected. It's not \"you look more muscular\" or \"have you lost weight?\" It's \"you seem more relaxed\" or \"you have more energy.\" These are vague compliments, but they point at something specific—a shift in baseline physiological state that other people can apparently detect, even if they can't name it.\n\nSo I started wondering: is there actual science behind this? Does cardiovascular fitness change something about how you're perceived by others—not through appearance, but through the deeper signals your body sends?\n\nHere's what I think is the most underappreciated consequence of improving your VO₂ max: it doesn't just change your cardiovascular system. It rewires your autonomic nervous system—the part of you that governs how calm or reactive you are at any given moment.\n\nYour autonomic nervous system has two main branches. The sympathetic branch handles fight-or-flight. The parasympathetic branch handles rest-and-digest. The balance between them determines your baseline state: are you walking through your day slightly on edge, or are you walking through it relatively settled?\n\nCardiovascular fitness directly strengthens parasympathetic tone. The mechanism is the vagus nerve—a long cranial nerve that runs from your brainstem to your gut, connecting your brain to your heart, lungs, and digestive system along the way. Higher vagal tone means your body is better at downshifting after stress. Your resting heart rate drops. Your heart rate variability increases. You recover from tense moments faster.\n\nA systematic review in Frontiers in Psychology found that higher heart rate variability—a direct marker of vagal tone—is associated with better emotional regulation, more adaptive coping strategies, and greater acceptance of emotions. People with higher HRV were better at downregulating negative emotional responses and handling social uncertainty.\n\nThis matters for how others perceive you because nervous system state isn't invisible. It leaks. It shows up in your breathing rate, your vocal steadiness, the tension in your shoulders, how quickly you react when someone says something unexpected. Research on HRV and social behavior suggests that parasympathetic regulation is linked not just to internal calm, but to outward prosocial behavior—empathy, attunement, the capacity to stay present during difficult conversations.\n\nA study in Psychophysiology found that individuals with higher resting HRV had better affective interaction quality during naturally occurring social interactions. They were also less aggressive, showed more accurate emotion recognition, and demonstrated more flexible emotional responses. Their interaction partners reported more positive experiences.\n\nNone of this is about looking a certain way. It's about the physiological foundation beneath your social presence. And cardiovascular fitness is one of the most reliable ways to build it.\n\nThere's a more visible channel, too—one I didn't take seriously until I read the research.\n\nA 2015 study from McMaster University published in Aging Cell found something striking: regular aerobic exercise doesn't just slow skin aging—it can actually reverse it. Researchers examined skin samples from sedentary adults over 65 who then completed a three-month exercise program. After the intervention, their skin's outer and inner layers resembled those of people decades younger. The researchers identified a muscle-derived protein called IL-15 that increases with exercise and appears to enhance mitochondrial function in skin cells.\n\nA 2023 study in Scientific Reports extended this, showing that both aerobic and resistance training significantly improved skin elasticity and dermal structure in sedentary middle-aged women over 16 weeks. The improvements were driven by changes in circulating inflammatory markers and increased expression of collagen-related genes.\n\nA narrative review in JMIR Dermatology synthesized the evidence: regular exercise increases blood flow to the skin, improves moisture retention, elevates skin temperature, and promotes structural changes that are associated with a more youthful appearance.\n\nThis isn't about vanity metrics. Skin quality is one of the most reliable nonverbal signals of overall health—something humans have evolved to notice, even unconsciously. You don't consciously evaluate someone's dermal collagen density when you meet them. But you register something. Their face looks rested. Their skin has a certain vitality. It reads as health, which reads as something adjacent to attractiveness.\n\nThere's another channel that's harder to measure but easy to feel: energy.\n\nNot the manic, caffeinated kind. The kind where someone seems genuinely present in a conversation, not visibly running on fumes. The kind where someone suggests walking to the next place instead of grabbing a cab, not because they're performatively athletic, but because they have the capacity to spare.\n\nCardiovascular fitness determines how much of your total physical capacity everyday life consumes. A 40-year-old with a VO₂ max of 45 uses a smaller fraction of their aerobic reserve to climb stairs, carry groceries, or walk across a parking lot than someone at 32. The physiological headroom is larger. Daily tasks cost less. What's left over shows up as available energy—for conversation, for engagement, for showing up fully rather than managing fatigue.\n\nThis connects to something I wrote about in the psychology of hard intervals: perceived exertion isn't just about exercise. Your brain's effort-monitoring system operates all day, weighing the cost of every action against your available resources. When your cardiovascular system is more efficient, the cost estimate for everyday physical tasks drops. You move through the world with less internal friction. That lower friction is perceptible to others, even if they'd never describe it in those terms.\n\nI wrote previously about how cardiovascular fitness affects mental health, and one piece of that research keeps coming back to me in this context.\n\nThe cross-stressor adaptation hypothesis suggests that repeatedly challenging your body with exercise trains your stress response to be more resilient against all forms of stress—not just physical. A randomized controlled trial found that 12 weeks of endurance training significantly reduced cortisol reactivity and heart rate responses during a psychosocial stress test. The exercise group literally became less physiologically reactive to social stress.\n\nThink about what that means in everyday life. The person who doesn't flinch when a meeting goes sideways. The friend who stays steady when everyone else is spiraling. The partner who can absorb bad news without immediately escalating. These aren't personality traits. They're partly expressions of autonomic regulation—the same system that cardiovascular fitness directly strengthens.\n\nI'm not claiming that a high VO₂ max makes someone charismatic. Charisma is complex, and personality matters enormously. But I am suggesting that the physiological calm that comes with better cardiovascular fitness creates a foundation for the kind of social presence people find appealing—steadiness, warmth, emotional availability, the ability to stay regulated when things get uncomfortable.\n\nI want to be precise about what the research supports and what it doesn't.\n\nThere's no study I've found that directly measures VO₂ max against rated attractiveness in a controlled setting. The connections I'm drawing are indirect: cardiovascular fitness improves vagal tone, which improves emotional regulation and social interaction quality. It improves skin health through measurable biological pathways. It increases available energy and reduces stress reactivity. These are all things that plausibly influence how someone is perceived.\n\nBut \"plausibly\" isn't \"proven.\" Correlation isn't causation, and self-selection is a real confound. People who exercise regularly may also sleep better, eat better, and have more structured lives—any of which could independently affect how they show up socially. The exercise itself may not be the sole driver.\n\nWhat I find compelling is that the mechanisms are specific and well-documented. We're not talking about vague \"exercise makes you feel good\" claims. We're talking about measurable changes in vagal tone, HRV, cortisol reactivity, skin structure, and energy availability—each supported by peer-reviewed research. The chain from fitness to physiology to social perception has real links, even if the full chain hasn't been tested end-to-end.\n\nI used to think about my training almost entirely in terms of numbers. VO₂ max. Heart rate zones. Benchmarks for my age. The longevity data. These are all real and motivating.\n\nBut the thing that actually keeps me training consistently isn't the number on my watch. It's how I feel in a room full of people. It's the fact that I'm less reactive to stress, more patient in conversations, and carrying less background tension through my day. It's the compound effect of a calmer nervous system, better sleep, and the quiet confidence that comes from knowing your body works well.\n\nWhether that makes me \"more attractive\" in any measurable sense, I genuinely don't know. But it makes me more available—to friends, to work, to the small daily interactions that make up a life. And I suspect that availability, that physiological presence, is what people are actually responding to when they say someone seems different after getting fit.\n\nThe changes that matter most aren't the ones you can see in a mirror. They're the ones other people feel when they're around you.\n\nTrack how your cardiovascular fitness is changing over time with VO2 Max Pro.

    "description": "A software engineer at Microsoft took his health for granted before being diagnosed with ulcerative colitis Now, he's more thoughtful about how he spends his time and energy.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Pronnoy Goswami, 31, who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in 2022, I thought: Why me?\n\nI didn't have lots of bad habits, I hadn't abused my body, and it took me a long time to accept what was happening to me.\n\nI considered giving up my dream of solving meaningful problems in tech at scale, taking a career break to focus on my health, and leaving the US to go back to my home country of India.\n\nUltimately, I stayed in the US and continued with my career while making huge changes to my lifestyle and work routine. I'm proud of what I've achieved in tech in spite of my adversities, and along the way, I've found my voice and a new vision of success.\n\nWhen I first got sick in 2021, I was working in Washington as a software engineer at Microsoft. Previously, I'd spent two years in software engineering at McKinsey, and a few months interning at PayPal. I now work at a large enterprise software company.\n\nI was on a trip with my partner just before Thanksgiving when I had rectal bleeding and felt weak, but I didn't think it was anything more serious than hemorrhoids or food poisoning. My symptoms kept getting worse, even after I consulted doctors and took medication. I was going to the restroom 15 to 20 times a day, and I lost a lot of weight.\n\nDoctors noticed my gut was inflamed, and referred me to a gastroenterologist. I was very scared.\n\nA colonoscopy showed I have ulcerative colitis, a type of inflammatory bowel disease that causes symptoms like abdominal pain and rectal bleeding.\n\nI'm used to putting 100% into my work, and when I was diagnosed in 2022, I'd been working on projects at Microsoft I felt were impactful. I took three to four weeks of sick leave, then returned to work, but I was completely remote for a year after my diagnosis.\n\nMy body struggles to absorb nutrients, and I get tired very quickly. I've had to make many dietary changes to manage flare-ups, including cutting out caffeine, alcohol, lactose, chile, and red meat.\n\nWhen my wife and I went on honeymoon in Hawaii in August 2025, we planned the trip down to the restaurants I could eat at and what I'd order. But then I ate something I hadn't planned at a lūʻau, and I was sick for two days, which was disheartening.\n\nAt first, I was scared to tell people about my condition, but when I started sharing with my colleagues, I found people empathized and judged me according to my merits.\n\nI have bad days related to my condition 20% of the time, and sometimes have to step away for appointments and procedures. For example, I have a colonoscopy every year because ulcerative colitis puts me at higher risk of getting colorectal cancer. I always try to catch up with tasks in my own time, and accept that I have to achieve the same things as others in less time.\n\nI left Microsoft and started working at a large enterprise software company in 2023. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the allure of startups is all around. However, I'm not physically or mentally ready to take the leap of faith to work at one yet. The stability of my current job is vital for my health.\n\nI also need to be careful with what jobs I consider, because a workplace might not be a good fit if it has a strict policy of being in the office five days a week and doesn't make accommodations. Plus, I'm very happy where I am.\n\nBefore I got sick, I took my health for granted, but I've started treating my body like a temple and am careful with how I'm spending my energy. I've come to define success as being healthy, because it helps me solve problems at work better.\n\nIt's also given me a voice. My diagnosis made me want to be more purposeful with my time, so I started exploring creative passions, like writing a newsletter and technical blogs. I want to connect with like-minded people and not live in a shell.\n\nWhen I look back at what I've achieved in my career since my diagnosis, I feel God has been kind to me. I've done interesting, cutting-edge work in tech, like building important infrastructure.\n\nBut I'm not done yet. I'm still in the early innings of my career, and I have a long way to go.\n\nMicrosoft declined to respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nDo you have a story to share about navigating a diagnosis alongside your career?

Kutsenko, 31, steps outside into the freezing night, switches on a large rectangular generator and the power kicks back in. It’s a pattern that will be repeated many times as the business struggles to keep working through the power outages caused by Russia’s bombing campaign on Ukraine's energy grid.\n\n“It’s now more than impossible to imagine a Ukrainian business operating without a generator,” said Olha Hrynchuk, the co-founder and head baker of Spelta.\n\nThe cost of purchasing and operating generators to overcome power outages is just one of many challenges facing Ukrainian businesses after nearly four years of war. Acute labor shortages due to mobilization and war-related migration, security risks, declining purchasing power and complicated logistics add to the pressure, officials say.\n\nHrynchuk, 28, opened the bakery 10 months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. That winter was the first year Russia targeted Ukraine’s energy system. Hrynchuk says they barely know what it is to work under “normal” conditions, but have never faced the challenges they do now.\n\nProduction is entirely dependent on electricity and the generator burns about 700 hryvnias ($16) worth of fuel per hour.\n\n“We run on a generator for 10 to 12 hours a day. You have no fixed schedule — you have to adapt and refuel it at the same time,” Hrynchuk said.\n\nOlha Nasonova, 52, who is head of the Restaurants of Ukraine analytical center, says the industry is experiencing its most difficult period of the past 20 years.\n\nWhile businesses were prepared for electricity cuts, no one expected such a cold winter and it’s been especially tough for small cafés and family-run establishments, because they have the least financial resources.\n\nThe “Best Way to Cup” project, which has two venues and roasts and grinds its own coffee, is on the brink of permanent closure. Co-founder Yana Bilym, 33, who opened the cafe in May, said a Russian attack shattered all its windows and glass doors in August. Bilym said the cost of renovation was 150,000 hryvnias (about $3,400), half of which she financed with a bank loan that she only recently finished repaying.",

    "description": "Lack of a state floodplain policy in Texas enabled oil companies to build in areas hit by an epic inundation less than 30 years ago.",
    "fullText": "GONZALES - More than 500 enormous oil tanks dot the floodplains of the Guadalupe River and its tributaries across one of Texas' leading oil fields, posing risk of environmental disaster in a flood climatologists say is almost certain to come.\n\nLongtime residents of this area's historic ranchlands vividly remember the last time these plains filled with water, in a biblical inundation in 1998. But that was before the fracking boom that hit the region because of the oil-rich geological formation that lies beneath it, known as the Eagle Ford Shale.\n\nToday, a repeat of the historic flood could wreak havoc, an Inside Climate News investigation has found.\n\n\"There's a whole lot of tanks full of oil that are going to float away,\" said Sara Dubose, a fifth-generation landowner in Gonzales County with 10 tanks in the floodplain on her family's ranchlands, each holding up to 21,000 gallons of oil or toxic wastewater. \"Spill all over our land and ruin it for 100 years.\"\n\nAlmost 20 feet of water could submerge some of the tanks on the Dubose family's land in a flooding event similar to 1998, according to an analysis of data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nInside Climate News scoured satellite imagery of the area to identify batteries of oil tanks and other oil field infrastructure in the Eagle Ford Shale near waterways in the Guadalupe River Basin. Using latitude and longitude coordinates of each tank battery, the analysis used FEMA flood mapping data to extract the agency's estimates for the depths of its benchmark flood scenarios at each location.\n\nIn some areas, the 1998 flood exceeded the worst-case scenario considered by disaster planners. FEMA calls it the \"500-year flood,\" a hypothetical event the agency estimates has a 0.2% chance of happening in any year.\n\nToday, a 500-year flood across the entire area analyzed would cover at least 22 tank batteries containing 144 individual oil and wastewater tanks with 10 or more feet of water. Of those, 12 tanks would sit beneath at least 20 feet of water.\n\nFEMA's estimates for a 500-year flood understate present risk in many locations, research shows, as warming air and oceans continue to fuel an intensification of extreme rainfall.\n\nDubose experienced the 1998 flood, when the Guadalupe River sprang from its banks and filled the shallow valleys at the edge of these coastal plains. The water almost reached her house, 7 miles from the river, where it trapped her for a week, covering U.S. 183 in both directions as it drained slowly into San Antonio Bay on the coast.\n\nIn a warming world with more intense rainfall, a future flood could be even more severe.\n\n\"One day, it's going to happen,\" Dubose said. \"We've all been concerned about the oil field flooding.\"\n\nWhen flooding hit a smaller oil field in 2013 in northeastern Colorado, authorities tallied two dozen overturned tanks and almost 90,000 gallons of oil and wastewater spilled. During Hurricane Katrina in 2005, millions of gallons of oil spilled when several supersized storage tanks floated off their pads. In 1994, flooding on the San Jacinto River in East Texas severed eight pipelines, ignited massive fires, injured hundreds of people and released more than 2 million gallons of petroleum products.\n\nLast summer, severe flooding in the Texas Hill Country near Kerrville washed away a girls' summer camp and killed more than 100 people along the Guadalupe River, 150 miles upstream from the Eagle Ford Shale.\n\nThe rules for building in floodplains in Texas fall to county governments, often small and rural. The 78 tank batteries in the Guadalupe floodplains analyzed all sit within Gonzales and DeWitt counties, which have a combined population of about 40,000 people.\n\nIt was left to the governments of the two counties to design and implement floodplain policies during the shale oil boom.\n\n\"Those are not issues that most counties, on an individual basis, are well suited to handle,\" said Todd Votteler, former executive manager of science, intergovernmental relations and policy at the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority. \"It raises a question of how serious the state is about avoiding future flood damage in high-risk areas if we don't have a statewide policy.\"\n\nTank batteries at well sites aren't typically secured to the ground by anything but the weight of the equipment and the oil and wastewater inside them. While they are especially vulnerable, they aren't the only industry infrastructure that could be affected by flooding. Eight oil pipelines and about two dozen gas pipelines also cross the Guadalupe River in the Eagle Ford Shale, and others cross local creeks.\n\nThe batteries in the floodplain on Dubose's property were previously operated by Canadian firm Baytex Energy, which sold all of its Eagle Ford Shale assets in November for $3.2 billion to an undisclosed buyer. Other operators with numerous batteries in the floodplains include EOG Resources, Devon Energy and Burlington Resources, a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips. None of those companies responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe floodplains also contain many open and buried pits of drilling waste. Dubose unsuccessfully sued an oil company in 2018, alleging that the unlined pit where it buried drilling mud and wastewater on her property was responsible for the orange, gassy goo that seeped up from the earth during heavy rainfall.\n\n\"Think about all the stuff that's soaked into the ground,\" said David Muir, a fifth-generation landowner with more than a dozen wells on his property. \"They've got thousands of chemicals that go into the drilling mud.\"\n\nMuir's land has been in his family since the 1840s. Outside his old, single-story ranch house near the border of Gonzales and DeWitt counties, a private airplane hangar and a waterpark-style swimming pool commemorate the riches fracking has brought to the region.\n\nInside the house between clamoring dogs, Muir sifted through boxes of photos that predated the shale boom. He pulled out strips of 11 film photos taped together to show the vast landscape of water that overtook this rolling savannah on the morning of Oct. 17, 1998.\n\nIt rose far past the tops of the trees. It even covered a spot on Muir's land where a tank battery now stands, 1.5 miles from the Guadalupe River.\n\n\"I thought the whole world was going to flood,\" he said as he flipped through the old pictures. \"We haven't had a flood like that since the oil field hit us.\"\n\nIt all seemed to happen in minutes, recalled Ben Prause, a former elected executive of DeWitt County who presided during the flood. The water wasn't even raging but almost calm as it swiftly rose up to swallow about two-thirds of the town of Cuero. In one case, he said, sheriff's deputies entered a home with water to their knees to save an old woman. When they walked out minutes later, the water was at their chests.\n\n\"It was so rapid,\" said Prause, 92, at his home in downtown Cuero, a few blocks from the 1998 waterline. \"It was just terrible. Water was everywhere.\"\n\nIt wasn't just the Guadalupe River, he said. Several major tributaries also flooded to make the situation worse. Torrential rains hit the upper reaches of Plum Creek and Sandies Creek, which both gushed simultaneously into the Guadalupe.\n\n\"What made it so bad is they all hit about the same time,\" he said.\n\nThese creeks barely trickle for most of the year, said Prause, a 1950 graduate of Cuero High School, but on rare occasions their large floodplains fill.\n\nIn 1998 the floodwaters south of Gonzales were several miles wide, said a report issued the next year by the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority and FEMA, exceeding predicted worst-case scenarios in some areas.\n\n\"It was the flood that many thought would never happen,\" the report said. \"Unfortunately, an even greater flood will occur sometime in the future.\"\n\nThe 1998 flood caused a few oil spills, said James Dodson, 71, co-founder of the San Antonio Bay Partnership and the son of a South Texas pipeline technician. His late wife worked for Texas' environmental regulator and spent weeks overseeing cleanups. But the extent of oil field infrastructure at that time was nothing compared with today.\n\n\"That was long before the Eagle Ford Shale plays came along,\" he said. \"The landscape was so much different in that regard - there's so many more facilities and well pads now.\"\n\nToday, along one eastward turn in the Guadalupe's snaking course, three batteries consisting of 15 tanks would sit under about 20 feet of water in a 500-year flood. One of them, operated by EOG Resources, is just 500 feet from the riverbank.\n\nTwo miles from the Guadalupe River, four tanks operated by Burlington Resources would take on almost 23 feet of water.\n\nNear Boggy Creek, east of the Guadalupe River by the small town of Dreyer, 10 feet of water would cover EOG Resources' Shiner Hub gas processing plant, a complex of 14 tanks, pipes, motors, chemical separators and flares.\n\nAlong Peach Creek, southeast of Gonzales, batteries of 12 and 28 tanks previously operated by Baytex Energy would sit under 13 feet and 8 feet of water, respectively.\n\nThe oil from toppled tanks probably wouldn't spill onto the land around them, said Dodson, a former water department director for the city of Corpus Christi who worked South Texas oil fields in the 1970s. Instead, he predicted, it would float on the water and end up at the edge of the flood's crest, like the rings in a bathtub. More of it, he said, would wash over the creeks and estuaries of San Antonio Bay and into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\"It's a disaster waiting to happen,\" said Sister Elizabeth Riebschlager, an 89-year-old Catholic nun from Cuero. \"They have these oil wells all through these areas that flooded like it's no problem.\"\n\nThe oil field infrastructure dates back less than 20 years to the shale revolution, when innovations in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing unleashed an explosion of new oil exploration.\n\nBack then, Riebschlager, the daughter of a local civic leader, conducted town hall meetings for local families baffled by the swarm of businessmen and lawyers descending on their sleepy countryside, whipping up 100-page contracts and casually writing checks for mind-boggling sums.\n\nMany landowners warned the oil companies about flooding, she said.\n\nRiebschlager related the story of one rancher: \"When they were getting ready to drill there, he said, ‘Please don't drill them here, it's a floodplain. They will flood.' The oil man says, ‘Don't worry, we'll have all the oil and gas out of this ground before the next flood.' ‘\n\nDubose, who missed out on the riches of the oil boom because her mother sold her family's mineral rights, got a similar answer when she mentioned the 1998 floods to the company drilling on her land. She recalls a man telling her: ‘That was a 100-year flood so it won't happen for another 100 years.'\n\nThat's a common misconception surrounding terms like a 100-year and the 500-year flood, said Matthew Berg, CEO of Houston-based water risk management firm Simfero. A former water specialist with Texas A&M AgriLife, he understands why the general public is misled.\n\n\"They would understand a 100-year flood only happens once every 100 years,\" he said. \"That's a problem because statistics don't work that way.\"\n\nSuch flood events don't literally return only once every century. Rather, computer models estimate that such an event has a 1% chance of occurring at any given spot in a year. What happened in previous years doesn't change those odds.\n\nFurthermore, Berg said, these estimated probabilities are \"to some extent meaningless\" where records go back barely 100 years. They are meant for purposes of development planning, not weather forecasting. The likelihood of storms across centuries isn't known. Neither is when the 500-year floodplain of the Guadalupe River may fill up again. Two things are certain, though: It will fill again and the chances are increasing.\n\nThe warming climate is making precipitation more intense in Texas and beyond. A similar amount of rain falls in fewer, more concentrated storms than it used to, according to a 2024 report from the Office of the Texas State Climatologist at Texas A&M University.\n\n\"Many studies have documented an increase in extreme rainfall in Texas and surrounding areas,\" the report said. \"Extreme rainfall is strongly affected by increased temperatures.\"\n\nIn Texas, as elsewhere on the planet, all 10 of the warmest years on record have occurred since 2011. Warming is a result of the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, released in large part by burning fossil fuels like the oil in the tanks sitting in the floodplains across the Eagle Ford Shale. And warmer air can hold more water vapor, leading to heavier downpours.\n\nIf global fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions continue to climb, so will extreme rainfall.\n\n\"Extreme precipitation is expected to increase in intensity on average statewide,\" the state climatologist's report said. \"We anticipate an additional increase of about 10% in expected extreme rainfall intensity in 2036 compared to 2001-2020 and an overall increase of over 20% compared to 1950-1999.\"\n\nThose changes in rainfall intensity correspond to a 50% increase in the likelihood of extreme precipitation compared to 2001-2020, the report said, and a 100% increase compared to 1950-1999.\n\nHowever, heavy rains alone don't always make a mega-flood. They have to fall on just the right areas, across multiple tributaries of a single river so that their waters all converge at once downstream.\n\nIf a 500-year flood returns to the Eagle Ford Shale, it's hard to tell how much oil, wastewater and other petroleum fluids could spill. Conventional oil field tanks range from 210 to 750 barrels in size, or from 13,000 to 32,000 gallons. Typical tank batteries in the Eagle Ford often include five 500-barrel oil tanks and one 500-barrel wastewater tank, according to an investor presentation by Baytex Energy. Some are out of use or empty, some are full, most are in between.\n\nWhatever fluids wash down the river would flow into San Antonio Bay, part of the winter grounds for the world's last flock of wild, endangered whooping cranes, then into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\"With a flood, it causes a lot more dispersion. It breaks it up then you've got oil mixed with sediment and debris. It can stink and it's much, much harder to clean up,\" said Diane Wilson, founder of San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper and a 77-year-old former shrimper who lives near the mouth of the Guadalupe River. \"It would be unbelievable, the damage it could do.\"\n\nLast summer, Dubose said, she thought it was about to happen. As soon as she saw the news late at night on the Fourth of July, she rushed out and sped her white Hummer down ranch roads to the river.\n\nIncredible rainfall was hitting the Guadalupe about 150 miles upstream in the Hill Country. Online posts said the water had washed away a summer camp for girls.\n\nDubose had flashbacks to 1998, when there were also overnight rainstorms far upriver that put this region underwater for a week. So she hurried to save a mobile home parked at her fishing camp by the river, the same spot where she'd lost a mobile home in 1998.\n\nAlmost there, she passed nervously between the towering, three-story tank batteries in the floodplain on her land, then past the site of the buried waste where, she said, the grass dies each time heavy rains bring the water table to the surface.\n\nLuckily for Dubose, no torrent came downriver. For Kerrville, in the Hill Country, it was the worst flood since 1987. But all the heavy rain fell upstream of a major dam and reservoir, where water levels were low enough to absorb it. So the Eagle Ford Shale was spared, for now.\n\n\"What happened in Kerrville, if that happens here, that's a really bad situation,\" Dubose said. \"We've told the oil field, this is going to flood someday.\"\n\nThis report is published in partnership with Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, independent news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment.\n\nThis article originally published at ‘Disaster waiting to happen': Fracking boom put hundreds of tanks in Guadalupe River floodplain.",

    "description": "(Reuters) Feb 8 - On the edge of Venezuela’s main oil city Maracaibo, members of a local branch of the ruling socialist party went door-to-door in the weeks after U.S. forces captured President",
    "fullText": "(Reuters) Feb 8 - On the edge of Venezuela’s main oil city Maracaibo, members of a local branch of the ruling socialist party went door-to-door in the weeks after U.S. forces captured President Nicolas Maduro, asking residents if they still supported the party that has run the country for nearly 20 years. The result: about half of members said they no longer did.\n\n“The response is very bad,” said a person who helped lead the effort. “There is division among us.”\n\nWhile Reuters was not able to independently verify the canvassing results, the reported drop in support aligned with ​information gathered from three other parts of the country.\n\nThe news agency spoke to 13 party members or local leaders across four states who reported fractures in the United Socialist Party (PSUV) following the U.S. attack. All of them expressed a deep sense of uncertainty and many voiced worries about their economic future.\n\nThe government’s ‌patronage system, which bought a form of party loyalty through financial benefits and food parcels, also appears to be under pressure, with five of the sources saying some contributions had stopped since Maduro’s capture.\n\nSix of the people described distrust among party loyalists and spreading suspicion of interim President Delcy Rodriguez. Eight said they had seen a drop in participation and support at their local party branch, with two of them estimating a ‌70% fall in attendance at events like marches and local assembly meetings.\n\nThe people Reuters spoke to all requested anonymity for fear of reprisal, with several saying local leaders were encouraging the party faithful to snitch on any members losing faith in the cause, a common tactic for weeding out popular dissent in Venezuela. Reuters has withheld the names of the people it interviewed to protect their safety.\n\nThere are no recent public numbers on party membership and while Reuters talked to people observing falling participation in four geographically dispersed states, the news agency could not determine what the situation was across all 24 states in the country. Most foreign media do not have permanent staff in the country and Venezuelans are generally reluctant to speak freely with reporters because of potential reprisals.\n\nNeither the Venezuelan government nor PSUV responded to Reuters requests for comment on the eroding support for the party and the fraying of its patronage system.\n\nCalls for national unity in the face of threats to Venezuela have been a constant in Rodriguez’s speeches and public appearances since Maduro's removal, and she has also cheered the resilience of the ⁠country's people and pledged economic development for all.\n\nDespite decrying Maduro’s detention as a kidnapping, Rodriguez appears to be complying with ‌U.S. demands to open the country to American oil companies and has also met with the director of the Central Intelligence Agency to discuss cooperation against drug trafficking.\n\nFraying party support at the grassroots level would be a problem for Rodriguez. Reuters has previously reported how she is already battling to shore up her rule by putting allies in positions of power to shield herself from the potential threat posed by Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, who also heads the PSUV and has close connections to the security services and colectivos - the hardline motorcycle-riding ‍enforcement arm of the party.\n\nPublicly, Cabello has stressed unity. On Jan. 12, he used his weekly press conference as party leader to emphasize Rodriguez has \"all the support of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela.”\n\nNeither U.S. President Donald Trump nor Rodriguez has seriously addressed the question of elections since Maduro’s ouster, but the anecdotal dwindling of local support appears to point to an uncomfortable truth for the PSUV: Maduro’s exit has done little to improve popularity, according to the party members Reuters interviewed.\n\nA local party leader in the northern state of Aragua said the party had no way to grow or ​win elections, “even if we had Che Guevara or Gandhi as a candidate.\"\n\n“You have a situation where the apparatus of repression is fragmenting and on top of that the remaining grassroots base is demobilizing. That’s a huge challenge for governability,” said Ricardo Rios, head of Caracas-based analysis and consultancy firm Poder & Estrategia.\n\nStill, local support for the party ‌may revive. Venezuela has already received $500 million from crude sales and any significant economic improvement could help boost funding of the party and get membership perks, which have historically helped buttress support, flowing again.\n\nIn response to Reuters questions about the problems facing the Socialist Party, a senior White House official said: “The country is stable, illegal migration has stopped, drug flows have halted, and the new oil deal will generate economic prosperity for both the Venezuelan and American people.\"\n\nAll of Venezuela's top officials are long-time members of the PSUV. The party was created in 2007 by merging the disparate political and social forces that swept socialist President Hugo Chavez to power in 1999. That movement also came to bear his name - ‘Chavismo.’\n\nThe reasons given for falling local support varied. Some said people were wary of being associated with the party if the opposition were to win power, fearing some form of retribution. Others said uncertainty was causing infighting in ⁠the party. Nearly all spoke of disillusionment and questioned the loyalty of the new leadership to the Chavista cause.\n\nAdding to people’s hardship are problems with the delivery of party handouts, both food and ​financial, that have hit local branches, five sources said. They said members in three states - Zulia, Aragua and Falcon – were deserting the party because the government had stopped making bonus payments and distributing welfare. Reuters ​was not able to independently verify the information it gathered about stalling handouts.\n\nGovernment payments, which through various different benefits can for some add up to over $100 a month, are a vital income for millions in Venezuela, where the monthly minimum wage is less than $1 and poverty is rampant. Inflation is also estimated by analysts to have topped 400% in 2025.\n\nThe complexity of Venezuela's welfare system, with an array of benefits delivered at different times to different people, meant Reuters was unable to get a complete picture of the status of all payments and food ‍parcels, with some of those interviewed saying certain bonuses were still arriving while others were ⁠not.\n\nOne source in Zulia state said that in their district 600 people had not received their “family bonus”, a direct welfare payment of up to $65 given to help with living costs. Three sources also reported that food parcels, known as CLAP, have not been delivered, with some adding that problems with these deliveries predate the capture of Maduro but have continued since.\n\nIn the municipality of Mara, in the northwest border with Colombia, one party member said there were old-school Socialist Party members still committed to the cause and “clapping like seals” but that even they are “turning because they haven't been paid their bonuses.\"\n\nAbout 70% of local party members and ⁠public employees in Mara ignored calls to participate in two recent pro-Maduro marches, the person said, leading bosses to threaten people with firings. Reuters could not establish the size of the marches or if there were any firings as a result.\n\nFour of the people Reuters spoke to reported that even the motorbike-riding ‘colectivos’ were attending fewer events and have not been mobilized to push people into public support of the government. Their ‌members have been responsible for killing opposition figures and anti-government protesters, according to reports, which Reuters has not independently confirmed, from organizations like Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe person in Mara said many colectivo members are now working as motorbike taxi drivers, failing to show up to marches despite threats from ‌local authorities to revoke their mototaxi work permits, the person said. \"They hide, they fake an illness and a few have gone to Colombia.\"",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Italian police fired tear gas and a water cannon at dozens of protesters who threw firecrackers and tried to access a highway near a Winter Olympics venue on Saturday.\n\nThe brief confrontation came at the end of a peaceful march by thousands against the environmental impact of the Games and the presence of U.S. agents in Italy.\n\nPolice held off the violent demonstrators, who appeared to be trying to reach the Santagiulia Olympic ice hockey rink, after the skirmish. By then, the larger peaceful protest, including families with small children and students, had dispersed.\n\nEarlier, a group of masked protesters had set off smoke bombs and firecrackers on a bridge overlooking a construction site about 800 meters (a half-mile) from the Olympic Village that's housing around 1,500 athletes.\n\nPolice vans behind a temporary metal fence secured the road to the athletes’ village, but the protest veered away, continuing on a trajectory toward the Santagiulia venue. A heavy police presence guarded the entire route.\n\nThere was no indication that the protest and resulting road closure interfered with athletes’ transfers to their events, all on the outskirts of Milan.\n\nThe demonstration coincided with U.S. Vice President JD Vance’s visit to Milan as head of the American delegation that attended the opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nHe and his family visited Leonardo da Vinci's “The Last Supper” closer to the city center, far from the protest, which also was against the deployment of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to provide security to the U.S. delegation.\n\nU.S. Homeland Security Investigations, an ICE unit that focuses on cross-border crimes, frequently sends its officers to overseas events like the Olympics to assist with security. The ICE arm at the forefront of the immigration crackdown in the U.S. is known as Enforcement and Removal Operations, and there is no indication its officers are being sent to Italy.\n\nAt the larger, peaceful demonstration, which police said numbered 10,000, people carried cardboard cutouts to represent trees felled to build the new bobsled run in Cortina. A group of dancers performed to beating drums. Music blasted from a truck leading the march, one a profanity-laced anti-ICE anthem.\n\n“Let’s take back the cities and free the mountains,” read a banner by a group calling itself the Unsustainable Olympic Committee. Another group called the Association of Proletariat Excursionists organized the cutout trees.\n\n“They bypassed the laws that usually are needed for major infrastructure project, citing urgency for the Games,” said protester Guido Maffioli, who expressed concern that the private entity organizing the Games would eventually pass on debt to Italian taxpayers.\n\nHomemade signs read “Get out of the Games: Genocide States, Fascist Police and Polluting Sponsors,” the final one a reference to fossil fuel companies that are sponsors of the Games. One woman carried an artificial tree on her back decorated with the sign: “Infernal Olympics.”\n\nThe demonstration followed another last week when hundreds protested the deployment of ICE agents.\n\nLike last week, demonstrators Saturday said they were opposed to ICE agents’ presence, despite official statements that a small number of agents from an investigative arm would be present in U.S. diplomatic territory, and not operational on the streets.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The U.S. has given Ukraine and Russia a June deadline to reach a deal to end the nearly four‑year war, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters, as Russian strikes on energy infrastructure forced nuclear power plants to cut output on Saturday.\n\nIf the June deadline is not met, the Trump administration will likely put pressure on both sides to meet it, he added.\n\n“The Americans are proposing the parties end the war by the beginning of this summer and will probably put pressure on the parties precisely according to this schedule,” Zelenskyy said, speaking to reporters on Friday. Zelenskyy’s comments were embargoed until Saturday morning.\n\n“And they say that they want to do everything by June. And they will do everything to end the war. And they want a clear schedule of all events,” he said.\n\nHe said the U.S. proposed holding the next round of trilateral talks next week in their country for the first time, likely in Miami, Zelenskyy said. “We confirmed our participation,” he added.\n\nZelenskyy said Russia presented the U.S. with a $12 trillion economic proposal — which he dubbed the “Dmitriev package” after Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev. Bilateral economic deals with the U.S. form part of the broader negotiating process.\n\nRussian strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure continued with over 400 drones and about 40 missiles launched overnight Saturday, Zelenskyy said in a post on X. Targets included the energy grid, generation facilities and distribution networks.\n\nUkrenergo, the state energy transmission operator, said the attack was the second mass strike on energy infrastructure since the start of the year, forcing nuclear power plants to reduce output. Eight facilities in eight regions came under attack, it said in a statement.\n\n“As a result of missile strikes on key high-voltage substations that ensured the output of nuclear power units, all nuclear power plants in the territories under control were forced to reduce their load,” the statement said.\n\nIt said the power deficit in the country has increased “significantly” as a result of the attacks forcing an extension of hourly power outages in all regions of Ukraine.\n\nThe latest deadline follows U.S.-brokered trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi that produced no breakthrough as the warring parties cling to mutually exclusive demands. Russia is pressing Ukraine to withdraw from the Donbas, where fighting remains intense — a condition Kyiv says it will never accept.\n\n“Difficult issues remained difficult. Ukraine once again confirmed its positions on the Donbas issue. ‘We stand where we stand’ is the fairest and most reliable model for a ceasefire today, in our opinion,” Zelenskyy said. He reiterated that the most challenging topics would be reserved for a trilateral meeting between leaders.\n\nZelenskyy said no common ground was reached on managing the Russian‑held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and expressed skepticism about a U.S. proposal to turn the Donbas region, coveted by Russia, into a free economic zone as a compromise.\n\n“I do not know whether this can be implemented, because when we talked about a free economic zone, we had different views on it,” he said.\n\nHe said in the last round of talks the negotiators discussed how a ceasefire would be technically monitored. He added that the U.S. has reaffirmed it would play a role in that process.\n\nRepeated Russian aerial assaults have in recent months focused on Ukraine’s power grid, causing blackouts and disrupting the heating and water supply for families during a bitterly cold winter, putting more pressure on Kyiv.\n\nZelenskyy said the U.S. again proposed a ceasefire banning strikes on energy infrastructure. Ukraine is ready to observe such a pause if Russia commits; but he added that when Moscow previously agreed to a one-week pause suggested by the U.S., it was violated after just four days.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "Elon Musk believes that space is the answer to the AI data center energy problem. SpaceX says it is hiring \"many engineers\" to make it happen.",
    "fullText": "To the world's richest man, all things eventually end in outer space.\n\nAs countries pour billions into new Earth-bound data centers in a global race for AI dominance, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk thinks the best way to conserve energy, money, and space is to put data centers in, well, space.\n\n\"In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale,\" Musk wrote in a memo announcing that SpaceX would acquire his AI company, xAI, earlier this month.\n\nSpaceX says its goal is to launch a \"constellation of a million satellites that operate as orbital data centers,\" and it's now hiring to make it happen. Each will generate about 100 kW of compute power per ton and would add 100 gigawatts of AI compute capacity annually, the company says.\n\nLike many of Musk's ambitious ideas, some have questioned the viability of this one. Musk, typically, is undeterred. He doubled down on the plan this week on the Dwarkesh Podcast.\n\n\"You can mark my words. In 36 months, but probably closer to 30 months, the most economically compelling place to put AI will be space,\" Musk, who is famous for missing deadlines, said. \"It will then get ridiculously better to be in space.\"\n\nDwarkesh Patel, the host of the eponymous long-form tech podcast (he interviewed Musk for nearly three hours), challenged the SpaceX CEO on his plan to build data centers in space.\n\nPatel said energy use is only about 10% to 15% of the total cost of operating a data center, so while planting data centers in space would solve the cost-of-energy problem, the cost of maintenance and servicing them would presumably erase any savings.\n\nMusk said the plan was not about saving money on energy consumption, but about ensuring energy availability.\n\n\"If you look at electrical output outside of China, everywhere outside of China, it's more or less flat,\" Musk replied. \"If you're putting data centers anywhere except China, where are you going to get your electricity?\"\n\nData centers are resource-intensive.\n\nThe largest can consume as much power as a city and up to several million gallons of water a day. Collectively, Business Insider estimated in an investigation published last year, that US data centers could soon consume more electricity than Poland, with a population of 36.6 million, used in 2023.\n\nBusiness Insider's investigation found that companies had filed permits to build 311 data centers nationwide as of 2010. By the end of 2024, that number had nearly quadrupled to 1,240.\n\nAs of 2023, about 4.4% of total US electricity consumption came from data centers, according to the Department of Energy. Globally, data centers accounted for about 1.5% of global electricity consumption in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nMcKinsey and Company estimates that by 2030, data centers will require $6.7 trillion in investment worldwide to keep pace with demand for computing power.\n\nThe need for data centers is driving enormous spending among the big AI companies. Capital expenditures for Big Tech are expected to reach some $600 billion in 2026, with Amazon alone planning to spend $200 billion.\n\nSpaceX has already started hiring for its space-based data center project.\n\nMichael Nicolls, the vice president of Starlink Engineering, wrote in a post on X on Friday that the company is hiring for \"many critical engineering roles\" to develop space-bound data centers. One of them is for a \"Space Lasers Engineer\" based out of Redmond, Washington.\n\nLocating data centers in space might appeal to the communities, like Northern Virginia, where electricity costs are growing and housing developments are vying with data centers for land.\n\nFor Musk, the idea is simple. \"I mean, space is called 'space' for a reason,\" he wrote in SpaceX's memo.\n\nSpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "title": "How to Create a Sleep Routine That's Perfect for You",
    "description": "If you're low on energy all the time, have you tried spending eight hours in a cool, dark, quiet room?",
    "fullText": "It's amazing how many problems can be solved with a little sleep hygiene. If you often feel low on energy, one of the first things you should ask yourself is how much sleep you're getting. Good sleep also helps our overall health, our recovery from exercise, our ability to focus, and more. And while there are plenty of gadgets and biohacks that claim to help, the fundamentals of sleep hygiene are basic and simple.\n\nMost adults need seven to nine hours of sleep, on average, each night. This varies: you might be a seven-hour person or a nine-hour person. (Young people usually need even more; older adults may be okay with less.) So if you’re feeling tired all the time, an easy gut check is to note how much time you spend in bed, on average. If it's fewer than seven hours, it's probably not enough. And even if it's within that seven- to nine-hour window, try getting an extra hour or two of sleep for a few days in a row. If you feel a lot better, you have your answer.\n\nWearables like smartwatches and rings can help collect data, but remember that the main thing they can tell you is how much sleep you're getting. (Sleep \"quality\" scores and even sleep stages are not necessarily reliable.) To call out a few of my favorites: the Oura ring is pricey ($349-$499) but comfortable to wear and presents data nicely. The Amazfit Helio Strap is a bargain at $99 and can track workouts, too. Garmin's Index Sleep Band ($169) is built for comfort while you sleep, but gives the same data as Garmin watches, so you may just want to find a watch you like and stick with that.\n\nIf you have trouble waking up on time but easily fall asleep when you’re sitting quietly (like watching a movie), that's another sign you're probably not getting enough sleep. If you sleep in when you get the chance, your wake-up time is another hint. If you sleep in two hours or more past your normal time, that's your body applying a short-term fix (getting enough sleep now) to a long-term problem (chronically getting too little sleep).\n\nIf you know you should sleep more, but you can’t seem to figure out how, below are the basics of sleep hygiene you need to master.\n\nSet a wake-up time that you can stick to every day. Consistency is important here: don’t set the alarm for 6 a.m. on weekdays and sleep until noon on weekends. If you can’t be perfectly consistent—for example, if you work different shifts—adjust as needed, but try to do your best.\n\nNext comes setting a bedtime. Figure out what time you need to hit the hay to get enough sleep before your alarm goes off. Then work backward from that to figure out when to start changing into jammies and whatever else your nighttime routine involves. (More on that routine below.)\n\nCrucial to both steps is prioritizing sleep so you can actually get yourself on schedule. If you’ve been having trouble getting enough sleep lately, give yourself a week or two to make your bedtime and wake-up time (and nine or so hours in between) the highest priority appointments in your calendar. Don’t go out too late, and don’t stay up revenge procrastinating. There will be time for occasional indulgences once your everyday schedule is more consistent.\n\nOkay, so what goes into that routine? Feel free to personalize the specifics, but sleep experts recommend that you include the following as basic building blocks:\n\nAt least 30 minutes dedicated to winding down. Don’t expect to switch off the lights and instantly be able to zonk out.\n\nNo screens right before bedtime. No, not even with blue-blocking glasses. Those glasses don’t actually block very much blue light anyway. Videos and social media keep your brain awake and unrelaxed, so they don’t really have a place in your wind-down time anyway.\n\nDim the lights. A cool, dark bedroom makes it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep.\n\nDo something relaxing. Read a chill book. Take a luxurious bath. Do some breathing exercises. Whatever works for you.\n\nSticking to this routine not only helps you get into a relaxed mood for sleeping, it also helps you stick to that sleep schedule you set in the first step. After all, you can't be halfway through a movie at 10 p.m. if you refrained from starting it at 9 p.m.\n\nSleep and darkness aren't the only things that set your body's circadian rhythms. Daytime activities help to keep your internal clock on track, and these can help your overall health as well.\n\nGet plenty of sunlight in the morning. (In the winter, a light box may help.)\n\nExercise during the day. You can combine this with sunlight by going for a morning or lunchtime walk. But any type of exercise will help you to sleep better.\n\nEat meals earlier in the day. We sleep best when we eat during the daytime; if a nice early breakfast fits your schedule, consider making it a regular thing. But at the very least, don’t eat right before bed.\n\nCaffeine keeps you up, and its effects linger longer than you may realize. Caffeine has a half-life of five hours, with some of us processing it a little faster or a little slower. To put this another way, If the average person has a 250-milligram cup of coffee at noon (such as a Starbucks Tall sized brewed coffee), they'll still have about 125 milligrams in their system at 5 p.m. and 63 milligrams at 10 p.m.\n\nThe speed with which we break down caffeine varies from person to person, but in general: It’s affecting you more than you realize. If you think of yourself as a person who “can have an energy drink and then fall right to sleep” you are probably (a) in denial—hey, you’re the one who clicked on an article about getting better sleep—and/or (b) you have built up a massive caffeine tolerance because you drink so much of the stuff to stay awake, which in turn is because you don’t get enough sleep so you’re tired all the time. Do yourself a favor and break the cycle. An easy way to back off is to give yourself a cutoff time. No caffeine after 5 p.m., let’s say. Once that’s part of your routine, walk it back to 2 p.m. or noon.\n\nAlcohol is another chemical that affects our sleep. A nightcap before bed may make you feel sleepy, but it tends to disrupt the quality of your sleep. If you aren’t convinced, just start keeping a sleep diary—on paper is fine if you don’t have a sleep-tracking gadget—and see if you don’t get more and better sleep on the nights you don’t drink.\n\nA welcoming, cozy bed will help you get to sleep faster. Make it dark, with blackout curtains or an eye mask, if needed. Make it quiet, with a white noise machine or earplugs if you can’t completely silence your surroundings. And make it a comfortable temperature. Most people prefer a cool environment—usually around 66 degrees—but again, this varies from person to person.\n\nComfortable sheets and pillows can help. If you’re always tossing and turning, try to figure out if there’s something that physically bothers you. A new mattress might not be in the budget, but a mattress topper or a different pillow is an easy fix.\n\nWhile the tips here are the basic things you should at least try, you may not need every single aspect to be textbook. I freeze if my room is set to 66 degrees, for example, so I keep the thermostat a tick warmer and I make sure I always have a warm duvet, even in summertime.\n\nYou may find that you can bend certain rules but not others. I always have a crappy night’s sleep if I’ve been drinking, but late meals don’t bother me much. Once you’re getting a solid night’s sleep on the regular, you can start playing with the routine.\n\nAnd if you’re doing everything you can for good sleep hygiene and you still feel tired all the time, consider seeking medical help in case you have sleep apnea or another condition that could be affecting your sleep or energy levels.",

    "fullText": "Russia said the United States is pushing Russian companies out of Venezuela's energy sector.\n\n\"Right now, following Venezuela and what is happening there, our companies are quite openly being pushed out of Venezuela,\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview with RT, a state-linked media network.\n\nThe US launched a military operation in early January that resulted in the capture of then-Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nIn the interview published on Thursday, Lavrov linked the US's pressure on Russian companies to broader efforts to curb Moscow's role in global oil markets.\n\nLavrov cited recent sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil, as well as tariffs and restrictions on countries purchasing Russian oil, including India.\n\n\"Everywhere it is being said that Russian oil and Russian gas will be replaced by American oil and American liquefied natural gas,\" Lavrov said.\n\nRussia now faces the prospect of significant financial losses in Venezuela following the US operation, which has upended decades of strategic cooperation between Moscow and Caracas spanning energy, defense, and diplomacy.\n\nEnergy ties played a central role, reflecting the importance of the oil sector to Russia's economy.\n\nA former US ambassador-at-large for the former Soviet Union warned last month that Russia's exposure in Venezuela could translate into concrete losses.\n\n\"Russian investments in Venezuela's oil industry over the last twenty years will now have to be, formally or informally, written off,\" wrote Stephen Sestanovich, the George F. Kennan senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nLoans for Venezuela's purchase of Russian weapons could meet the same fate, while trade between the two countries could also come to a halt, Sestanovich added.\n\nThat would come at a sensitive moment for Russia's economy.\n\nAs the war in Ukraine approaches its fifth year, sweeping Western sanctions and lower oil prices are weighing on budget revenues that fund President Vladimir Putin's war chest. In January, Russia's oil revenue plunged to its lowest level in over five years.\n\nAt least one Russian state-owned oil company has moved to ringfence its exposure. Last month, Roszarubezhneft said that all of its Venezuelan assets are owned by the Russian state.",

    "fullText": "A routine fuel stop turned into a national political flashpoint after a gas station employee refused service to federal immigration agents, igniting a debate that now reaches far beyond politics and squarely into the automotive and fuel retail space.\n\nThe incident unfolded at a Speedway gas station in Minneapolis when Border Patrol agents attempted to refuel government vehicles during official operations.\n\nAccording to video footage that quickly spread online, a man identifying himself as the store’s manager denied service and stated bluntly that he did not support ICE, adding that no one at the store did either. The agents were told to leave without being allowed to purchase fuel.\n\nWithin hours, the encounter became a lightning rod. Critics accused the business of politicizing a basic commercial service, while supporters framed the refusal as a form of protest.\n\nBut for the automotive and fuel industries, the episode raises deeper questions about neutrality, safety, and the evolving role of gas stations in an increasingly polarized environment.\n\nFuel stations occupy a unique position in American infrastructure for the simple fact that they aren’t simply retail outlets. They are essential service points relied upon by private motorists, commercial fleets, emergency responders, and, yes, government agencies like ICE.\n\nDenying fuel is not equivalent to refusing a cup of coffee or retail merchandise. Vehicles without fuel do not operate, and in the case of law enforcement or emergency services, that reality carries serious implications.\n\nIndustry experts note that while private businesses generally retain the right to refuse service, gas stations historically operate under an expectation of political neutrality. Fleet contracts, fuel cards, and government supply agreements are built on reliability, not ideology.\n\nOnce a station is perceived as selectively serving customers based on political or occupational identity, that reliability comes into question.\n\nThe fallout for Speedway and its parent companies has been swift. Calls for boycotts surfaced almost immediately, with critics warning that the brand risks alienating everyday drivers who view fuel access as nonpartisan.\n\nOthers warned of reputational damage that could ripple across franchise networks, where individual store decisions can reflect on national brands regardless of corporate policy.\n\nThere is also a safety dimension that automotive analysts are watching closely. Federal agents often refuel during active operations or long-distance deployments. Forcing vehicles to reroute in search of fuel introduces delays and unpredictability.",

    "fullText": "Global warming means the future of Winter Games “is literally melting away.”\n\nSome of the world’s greatest winter sports athletes have called on the International Olympics Committee to stop taking fossil fuel industry money, including from Italian oil giant ENI, a “Premium Partner” of the 2026 Winter Olympics. “The time has come to question the ethical implications of…normalizing the connections between our sports and the detrimental effects of the product that [fossil fuel companies] sell,” reads a petition delivered yesterday to IOC officials in Milan, Italy, where the Games’ opening ceremony takes place on Friday.\n\nBurning oil, gas, coal, and other fossil fuels is the main driver of global warming, which is raising winter temperatures and reducing the snow cover that skiing and other winter sports require. Winters are rapidly warming across much of the Northern Hemisphere, threatening not only the Olympics but also communities economically and culturally dependent on skiing and other winter recreational activities.\n\nTo date, the petition to the IOC and the International Ski and Snowboard Federation has attracted more than 20,000 signatories, including Alex Hall of the US, who won the Olympic gold medal in freestyle skiing at the 2022 Winter Games; Helvig Wessel of Norway, the 2024 Freeride World Tour skiing champion; and Nikolai Schirmer, also of Norway, whose nonprofit Ski Fossil Free organized the petition and hand-delivered it to IOC officials on February 4; a full list of signatories is available here.\n\nAlthough neither the IOC nor ENI have yet commented on the petition, the IOC did purchase 2.4 million cubic meters of artificial snow to enable reliable conditions for events taking place in the Italian Alps town of Cortina d’Ampezzo. ENI, which has said it aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, announced in December that “90% of the fuels that Eni…will supply to power the Games will be derived from renewable feedstocks.”\n\nFebruary temperatures have warmed by 3.6 degrees Celsius (6.4 degrees Fahrenheit) over the 70 years since Cortina hosted the first Winter Olympics in 1956, according to new research from the scientific nonprofit Climate Central. Cortina now experiences 41 fewer freezing days per year than it did in 1956. Globally, only half of the locations deemed suitable for future Winter Olympics will have reliably cold temperatures by the year 2050, Climate Central found. “Unless we address human-caused climate change and the fossil fuel burning that we’re doing, the possibility of having Winter Olympics is literally melting away,” Kaitlyn Trudeau, a Climate Central scientist who conducted the research, said at a press briefing on January 28 cohosted by Climate Central and Covering Climate Now.\n\n“People in my community aren’t discussing whether or not climate change is real.… it’s very, very apparent when we look at the high mountains,” said Graham Zimmerman, a professional alpinist and director of athletic alliance for the nonprofit Protect Our Winters, which supported the petition drive. Zimmerman and a team were 7,000 meters (23,000 feet) up Pakistan’s K-2, the second-highest peak in the world, when melting snow and ice forced them to shelter in place on a narrow ledge for 14 hours. “It’s an altitude where, generally speaking, you are putting on all of the puffy clothes to stay warm,” he said. “Instead, we found ourselves in temperatures of 42 degrees [F] in the shade, having to take shelter from avalanches and rock fall because the mountain was literally falling apart.”\n\nAlthough amateur climbers, skiers, and snowboarders are not immune to such dangers, the greater risk for them is simply fewer opportunities to enjoy their favorite winter sports. “Climate Central data shows a steady decline in snowfall at nearly two-thirds of monitoring stations” in the United States, Ben Tracy, a climate journalist on assignment for Climate Central, said in a TV report shown during the briefing (and available for TV stations to air free of charge). “For the ski industry, that meltdown means billions in lost revenue.” A resort Tracy visited in Idaho that normally would have 42 ski runs open had only one—and that one was open only because of costly artificial snow.\n\nThat winters are rapidly warming even as bitter cold grips much of the US at the moment may seem counterintuitive to some people (including the nation’s climate-denier in chief), but scientists explain that weather is not the same thing as climate. “In a warming world we’re still going to have cold snaps, they’ll just be less frequent,” Trudeau said. A good way to think about it, she added, is that “weather is [the clothes] you’re wearing today. Climate is the clothes you have in your closet.”\n\nThe unreliability of winters on a warming planet leads Rocky Anderson, the former mayor of Salt Lake City, Utah, to emphasize the urgency of phasing out fossil fuels. Anderson was the mayor when Salt Lake City hosted the 2002 Games, a role it is scheduled to repeat in 2034. But during his interview with Tracy, he pointed to the majestic peaks east of the city and noted, “There’s almost no snow anywhere in those mountains,” adding, “I don’t think we’re going to see a Winter Olympic Games in Utah in 2034.”\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nJupiter is slightly smaller and flatter than scientists thought for decades, a new study finds.\n\nResearchers used radio data from the Juno spacecraft to refine measurements of the solar system's largest planet. Although the differences between the current and previous measurements are small, they are improving models of Jupiter's interior and of other gas giants like it outside the solar system, the team reported Feb. 2 in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n\n\"Textbooks will need to be updated,\" study co-author Yohai Kaspi, a planetary scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, said in a statement. \"The size of Jupiter hasn't changed, of course, but the way we measure it has.\"\n\nUntil now, scientists' understanding of Jupiter's size and shape have been based on six measurements performed by the Voyager 1 and 2 and Pioneer 10 and 11 missions. Those measurements, which have since been adopted as standard, were performed around 50 years ago using radio beams, according to the statement.\n\nBut the Juno mission, which has been gathering data on Jupiter and its moons since it arrived at the gas giant in 2016, has collected much more of this radio data in the past two years. With that additional data, researchers have now refined measurements of Jupiter's size down to about 1,300 feet (400 meters) in each direction.\n\n\"Just by knowing the distance to Jupiter and watching how it rotates, it's possible to figure out its size and shape,\" Kaspi said. \"But making really accurate measurements calls for more sophisticated methods.\"\n\nIn the new study, the scientists tracked how the radio signals from Juno back to Earth bent as they passed through Jupiter's atmosphere, before cutting out when the planet blocked the signal entirely. Those measurements allowed the team to account for Jupiter's winds, which slightly alter the shape of the gaseous planet. Then, they used that information to make precise calculations of the planet's shape and size.\n\nWith the new data, the team calculated that the planet's radius from its pole to its center is 41,534 miles (66,842 km) — 7.5 miles (12 km) smaller than previous measurements. The newly calculated radius at the equator is 44,421 miles (71,488 km) — 2.5 miles (4 km) smaller than previously thought.\n\n\"These few kilometers matter,\" study co-author Eli Galanti, an expert on gas giants at the Weizmann Institute of Science, said in the statement. \"Shifting the radius by just a little lets our models of Jupiter's interior fit both the gravity data and atmospheric measurements much better.\"\n\n—Jupiter is shrinking and used to be twice as big, mind-boggling study reveals\n\n—Spiders on Jupiter? Scientists uncover secret origins of arachnid-like 'demon' lurking on gas giant's moon\n\n—Is Jupiter's Great Red Spot an impostor? Giant storm may not be the original one discovered 350 years ago\n\nThe updated measurements will improve our understanding of Jupiter's interior, as well as help scientists interpret data from gas giants beyond the solar system, the researchers wrote in the study.\n\n\"This research helps us understand how planets form and evolve,\" Kaspi said in the statement. \"Jupiter was likely the first planet to form in the solar system, and by studying what's happening inside it, we get closer to understanding how the solar system, and planets like ours, came to be.\"",

    "fullText": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Russian missiles and drones have pounded Ukraine’s energy grid in recent weeks, plunging people into frozen darkness in one of the country’s coldest winters on record.\n\nUkraine has accused Russia of illegally targeting power infrastructure during the war to deny civilians light, heating and running water.\n\n\"Taking advantage of the coldest days of winter to terrorize people is more important to Russia than diplomacy,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday, on the eve of a new round of talks about ending the conflict and as temperatures in Kyiv hovered around minus 20 C (minus 3 F).\n\nRussia says its attacks are a legitimate part of its military campaign against its neighbor. Moscow's invasion of Ukraine itself is widely regarded as an illegal act of aggression.\n\nSo, are attacks on energy installations allowed during war?\n\nCombatants can legally target a power grid if the attack “directly affects a valid military target” — but they cannot cause excessive civilian casualties, said David Crane, former chief prosecutor at the United Nations Special Court for Sierra Leone.\n\nIn the case of Russia's attacks on Ukraine, “the indiscriminate and widespread targeting does not come close to what is legal,” he said in an emailed response to questions from The Associated Press.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross says that parts of energy systems providing essential services to civilians “are in principle civilian objects, and as such are protected against direct attack and reprisals as well as incidental harm.”\n\nPretrial judges from the International Criminal Court, in fact, issued arrest warrants in 2024 for top Russian military brass and the country’s former defense minister for their alleged involvement in missile strikes targeting electricity infrastructure.\n\nIn announcing warrants for former Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Russia’s chief military officer, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the court said that judges found “reasonable grounds to believe that the alleged strikes were directed against civilian objects, and for those installations that may have qualified as military objectives at the relevant time, the expected incidental civilian harm and damage would have been clearly excessive to the anticipated military advantage.”\n\nRussia is not a member of the court, rejects its jurisdiction, and refuses to extradite suspects to face justice in the ICC’s courtrooms in The Hague, Netherlands.\n\nThe Russian military has repeatedly said that it has targeted energy facilities and other infrastructure that support Ukrainian military industries and armed forces. It has denied targeting residential areas despite daily evidence to the contrary.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted Wednesday that “our military is striking the targets that they believe are associated with the military complex of the Kyiv regime, the operation is continuing.”\n\nKyiv accuses Russia of seeking to wear down Ukrainians’ appetite for the fight by inflicting grinding hardship on civilians forced to live in dark, freezing homes.\n\nAuthorities say Russia has tried to cripple Ukraine's electricity network by targeting substations, transformers, turbines and generators at power plants. Ukraine’s largest private power company, DTEK, said that this week's overnight attack was the ninth major assault on the company’s thermal power plants since October.\n\nUkraine’s energy sector has suffered more than $20 billion in direct war damage, according to a joint estimate by the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations.",

    "fullText": "Known as ‘white gold’, lithium is among the most important mined elements on the planet – ideal for the rechargeable batteries used in tech products. Can Europe’s largest deposit bring prosperity to the local community?\n\nIt looks more like the past than the future. A vast chasm scooped out of a scarred landscape, this is a Cornwall the summer holidaymakers don’t see: a former china clay pit near St Austell called Trelavour. I’m standing at the edge of the pit looking down with the man who says his plans for it will help the UK’s transition to renewable energy and bring back year-round jobs and prosperity to a part of the country that badly needs both. “And if I manage to make some money in the process, fantastic,” he says. “Though that is not what it’s about.”\n\nWe’ll return to him shortly. But first to the past, when this story begins, about 275-280m years ago. “There was a continental collision at the time,” Frances Wall, professor of applied mineralogy at the Camborne School of Mines at the University of Exeter, explained to me before my visit. This collision caused the bottom of the Earth’s crust to melt, with the molten material rising higher in the crust and forming granite. “There are lots of different types of granite that intrude at different times, more than 10m years or so,” she says. “The rock is made of minerals and, if you’ve got the right composition in the original material and the right conditions, then within those minerals there are some called mica. Some of those micas contain lithium.”\n\nThat’s what we are talking about here: lithium, the L-word. Or possibly the El Dorado word; lithium is often referred to as “white gold”, and in 2021 the then PM Boris Johnson declared that Cornwall would be the “Klondike of lithium”.\n\nIt is not breaking news that there is lithium here. Victorian miners reported finding it in the water coming from the ground. (You may know, possibly from Poldark, about Cornwall’s rich history mining tin and copper; it has been going on since the early bronze age, in about 2000BC.) Back then there was little use for lithium. Now it is a very different story. Its high electrochemical potential means lithium can hold a charge for longer than most other elements and so is ideal for use in rechargeable batteries. That’s phones, laptops and so much of the technology we use. Plus, electric cars and big battery storage projects. Lithium is now among the most important mined elements on the planet.\n\nMost of the world’s lithium is extracted in Australia and the lithium triangle in South America (Chile, Argentina and Bolivia), as well as in China, which also processes and therefore controls a majority of it for use in batteries. Cornwall doesn’t compare in scale, but it is, says Wall, “probably the largest lithium deposit in Europe”. A couple of companies – British Lithium and Cornish Lithium – are leading the way to tap into it.\n\nJeremy Wrathall is the founder of the latter. When he graduated from Camborne School of Mines in 1988, mining in Cornwall was gasping its last breaths – with just four active mines left, down from more than 300 in the 1860s. Now there are none, though there are still some china clay (kaolin) operations. So Wrathall went to work in South African goldmines, before returning to London to work as a mining analyst and financier.\n\nCornwall remained in his heart, though, and when electric cars began to be a thing, he remembered hearing about the lithium there. “I put lithium plus Cornwall into Google and up came four historical records of lithium being found in water. I thought: that one is an awful long way away from that one, they must be geologically connected. And then I thought: maybe I’m on to something and should start picking up mineral rights. So that’s what I did.”\n\nAlong with the mineral rights for which he did deals, Wrathall acquired a number of 19th-century mining plans, which gave him information about geological features – the granite and what was in it. He founded Cornish Lithium in 2016.\n\nWrathall says the UK – particularly Cornwall – will be able to extract 50,000 tonnes of lithium (actually lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate equivalent, depending on how it’s extracted) a year for more than 20 years – about 50% of the UK’s annual needs by 2030. There are two methods. One is to extract lithium from water via deep boreholes, which we will get to later. Here at Trelavour is the company’s “hard rock extraction” site. Wrathall picks up a small piece of rock. “You can see the sparkly bits, that’s the mica – all of this rock, everything you can see, has lithium.”\n\nHe explains that there will be some blasting, then the granite will be dug from the quarry and crushed before going on a conveyor belt to the processing plant in the valley. But, hang on; this doesn’t sound super sustainable, even if the intended destination is the UK’s transition to clean renewable energy. Lithium mining projects in Portugal and Serbia have been hampered by fierce opposition from locals and environmentalists. In Argentina, mining companies and politicians have been accused of robbing Indigenous people of their water and employing colonial-style divide-and-rule tactics in pursuit of the valuable metal. Why is that not happening here?\n\nWall explains that it is a very different process in South America, where brine gets pumped into a series of ponds and then evaporates slowly in the sun. Cornwall has neither the geology nor climate for that. Trelavour is a traditional quarry, “so you’ve got all your normal stuff associated with quarrying: drilling, blasting and lorries.” Environmental permits are very strict, she says, and they’ll need to sort out what they’re doing with the waste. “But the granite is pretty benign, it’s not like some of the sulphides, where you have a lot of trouble with acid mine drainage [the outflow of acidic water largely from metal and coal mines].”\n\nSome of the byproducts could be valuable: silica for cement, sulphate of potash for fertiliser, gypsum for plasterboard. Wrathall says the company’s crushers are electric and it will look into using electric trucks. “We’re trying our best to go zero carbon, or very low carbon.” The situation in Cornwall is different from the controversial projects in Europe, he says, because the quarry already exists; they will simply be repurposing it. “You can see the damage is done. In Portugal, it is a pristine area, olive groves, it would be digging up people’s farms. This is not a farm. What are you going to do with this? It’s dangerous, fenced-off to stop people getting in. And at the end of it, we will rehabilitate it.”\n\nI have found it hard to find anyone who is really against the project. Charmian Larke of the Cornwall Climate Action Network says: “Because the area is so destroyed anyway, the surrounding villages tend to be very poor, with poor health and educational outcomes.” Wrathall says the Cornish people are proud of their 4,000-year history of mining, “and it will bring back economic prosperity to an area with one of the highest levels of deprivation in the country”.\n\nOn cue, we are joined by Peter Morse, general manager of the hard-rock project here. He grew up in the nearby village of Roche. His family has been here for generations, he says, mostly working in the china clay industry, and he used to ride around in a truck with his grandad, driving in and out of the plants. He thought he would go into it, too, and did a geology degree. Instead, he went to the US, where he worked in the mining industry for 30 years.\n\nWrathall and Morse are what are known as “Cousin Jacks” – Cornish miners who went abroad to work. “If you go anywhere in the world and there’s a hole, there’ll be a Cousin Jack at the bottom of it,” says Morse. They took a bit of Cornwall with them: he says he could get a pasty on the shores of Lake Superior.\n\nWhen he came back home, it was different from when he left: fewer people were employed in the china clay business. St Dennis, the village nearest to the site, used to have three pubs and a bunch of shops. Now there is just one of each. “And St Austell is not the town it was when I went to school there. It was bustling, lively – but it doesn’t feel like that now.”\n\nMorse says lithium can help to reverse the trend. Cousin Jack is back. I also spoke to Noah Law, another local, now Labour MP for St Austell and Newquay. “Mining is part of our heritage, it’s part of what makes Cornwall great. It has made us wealthy in the past and can do the same again.”\n\nThings have changed though. “Mining is more capital intensive than it used to be, and not as labour intensive. Part of the challenge is sharing the prosperity. I’ve levelled with the industry to say we’re really invested in this and are going to work hard to make a success of the industry, if it is willing to work really hard to make sure my constituents are sharing the spoils.”\n\nLaw says Cornwall can be a beautiful place and an industrial powerhouse, “because that’s what we have been for the most of the past 200-300 years. It’s only recently that Cornwall hasn’t been an industrial economy.”\n\nCornish Lithium employs just over 100 people, and the plan is to triple that. “Every mining job provides at least four times as many knock-on jobs,” says Wrathall. And not just another shop selling wetsuits or ice cream. “They’re good, but that’s not going to make any difference to the lives of people here. What is going to make a difference is the development of an industry that is already here, but is now seeing its next generation. It’s going to change Cornwall’s future.”\n\nWe have come down from the quarry to the processing plant, where the lithium gets extracted from the granite. At this stage it’s a demonstration facility, but it still takes up a huge shed, a remnant of a former china clay facility. The crushed granite comes in at one end and the lithium is extracted in a series of processes. First physical – milling, soaking, spinning – followed by chemical separation that involves dissolving the mica in sulphuric acid. All the machinery – mills and pipes, scrubbers and chillers, pumps and vats – looks rather Willy Wonka. And here’s a bag of the end product – lithium hydroxide, a white crystalline power that looks, frankly, illegal.\n\nAbout 20 miles away, the villages of St Day and Gwennap were once big centres for tin and copper mining and the surrounding landscape is dotted with derelict brick engine houses from that time. Between the two is now the centre for Cornish Lithium’s other project: geothermal extraction. It doesn’t look much, a capped borehole in the corner of the United Downs industrial estate, but under the cap a shaft goes down 800 metres. This was the first exploratory hole. They’ve since done others, including one 2km deep on a farm a few miles away at Cross Lanes. The results were very positive and Cross Lanes has recently been granted planning permission for the country’s first commercial geothermal lithium production facility.\n\nIn another shed, Adam Matthews, who leads the geology team, shows me what it’s all about. Laid out on trays are hundreds of core samples of rock from the Cross Lanes drill holes: they look like pencil leads for giants. One is solid, “siltstone and sandstones mostly, the darker bands are muds, nothing of much interest”, says Matthews. But here’s one from 1,700 metres down, “and you can see fractures running throughout the rock. The water flows naturally throughout those fractures.”\n\nIn this water – hot brine – they have found lithium. The next stage is to drill two new larger diameter 2km-deep holes, one to pump the water out, the other to return it once the lithium has been extracted. It’s probably the least impactful, most sustainable way of getting hold of lithium.\n\nThe water at that depth is between 80 and 90C and Wrathall says it could be used to provide low-carbon heat energy for communities and industries. There are few houses to heat near to Cross Lanes, but he says the heat could be used in agriculture. “There is an opportunity to build greenhouses there, to grow tomatoes and cucumbers.”\n\nIt sounds wonderful – pumping water out of the ground, extracting the mineral that will help the country on its transition to renewable energy, then returning the water to where it came from … with a byproduct of locally grown salad.\n\nBut we’re not quite there yet. The next phase will be to build a demonstration plant to produce samples of lithium. If successful, the company will build a commercial production plant there. The Trelavour hard rock site is also still at the demonstration phase. Wrathall thinks they will first be producing lithium commercially in 2028 or 29. Even then the UK will still have to import about half of what it needs. Reliance on China isn’t over yet.\n\nSince they’ve been looking at lithium in Cornwall, “we’ve seen critical minerals go from ‘Who cares?’ to ‘Oh my goodness, what are we going to do?’” says Wrathall. “Why is Trump interested in Greenland? Minerals. Ukraine? Minerals. Canada? Minerals? I’m just hoping he doesn’t find out about Cornwall!”",
