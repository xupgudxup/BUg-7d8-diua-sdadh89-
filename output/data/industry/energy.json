    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian drone strikes damaged energy networks in Russia-occupied parts of southern Ukraine, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without power on Sunday, according to Kremlin-installed authorities there.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow has kept up its hammering of Ukraine’s energy grid in overnight attacks that killed at least two people, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nMore than 200,000 households in the Russia-held part of Ukraine’s southern Zaporizhzhia region had no electricity on Sunday, according to the Kremlin-installed local governor.\n\nIn a Telegram post, Yevgeny Balitsky said that nearly 400 settlements have had their supply cut, because of damage to power networks from Ukrainian drone strikes.\n\nRussia has hammered Ukraine’s power grid, especially in winter, throughout the nearly four-year war. The strikes aim to weaken Ukrainians’ will to resist in a strategy that Kyiv officials call “weaponizing winter.”\n\nRussia targeted energy infrastructure in Odesa region overnight on Sunday, according to Ukraine’s Emergency Service. A fire broke out and was promptly extinguished.\n\nAt least six people were wounded in the Dnipropetrovsk region from Russian attacks, the emergency service said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a Telegram post that repairing the country’s energy system remains challenging, “but we are doing everything we can to restore everything as quickly as possible.”\n\nHe said that two people were killed in overnight attacks across the country that struck Sumy, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia, Khmelnytskyi and Odesa.\n\nIn total, more than 1,300 attack drones, 1,050 guided aerial bombs and 29 missiles of various types were used by Russia to strike Ukraine this week, Zelenskyy said.\n\n“If Russia deliberately delays the diplomatic process, the world’s response should be decisive: more help for Ukraine and more pressure on the aggressor,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe spoke the day after a Ukrainian delegation arrived in the United States for talks on a U.S.-led diplomatic push to end the war.\n\nOn Friday, Zelenskyy said that the delegation would try to finalize with U.S. officials documents for a proposed peace settlement that relate to postwar security guarantees and economic recovery.\n\nIf American officials approve the proposals, the U.S. and Ukraine could sign the documents next week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Zelenskyy said at a Kyiv news conference with Czech President Petr Pavel. Trump plans to be in Davos, according to organizers.\n\nRussia would still need to be consulted on the proposals.\n\nSeparately, in Russia’s Caucasus mountains, two children and an adult were wounded overnight as debris from a Ukrainian drone fell on a five-story residential building in North Ossetia, according to the regional governor.\n\nSeventy people had to be evacuated from the building, in the town of Beslan, and there was damage to its roof and windows, Gov. Sergei Menyaylo said in a Telegram post on Sunday morning.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said that its forces shot down or suppressed 63 Ukrainian drones overnight over Russia and the occupied Crimean Peninsula. One person was hospitalized in Russia’s Krasnodar region east of Crimea following a drone strike, local authorities said.\n\nUkrainian crews have started repair works on the backup power line connecting the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to the power grid, under a ceasefire brokered by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Vienna-based U.N. organization said in an X post on Sunday.\n\nThe fate of the plant, occupied by Russia and the largest in Europe, is a central issue in ongoing U.S.-brokered peace talks.\n\n“Crucial repair works on the essential back up Ferosplavna-1 330 kV power line connecting Ukraine’s ZNPP to the grid have begun under another IAEA-brokered ceasefire,” the agency said in the post.\n\nThe 330-kilovolt power line, which was damaged and disconnected because of fighting, is crucial to supplying the plant with electricity.",

    "fullText": "UK gas prices don't form in isolation - they're the result of a global system where LNG tankers move molecules across oceans, storage facilities buffer seasonal demand swings, and physical constraints create friction that simple supply-demand models miss.\n\nThis guide explains the infrastructure and economics that connect US shale production to UK power plants. You'll learn how LNG shipping works, why UK gas prices track Henry Hub (Louisiana) with a 6-8 week lag, and how traders calculate netback prices to decide whether exporting US gas to Europe is profitable. You'll see why LNG is the flexible marginal source while Norwegian pipelines provide inflexible baseload, and how charter rate volatility (which spiked 5x in 2025) can turn a profitable cargo into a loss overnight.\n\nThe guide also covers the UK's structural vulnerability: storage capacity below 2% of annual demand (versus 20% in continental Europe). You'll understand why this makes UK prices volatile, how storage arbitrage works (and why most seasonal spreads don't cover storage costs), and why NBP can decouple from TTF despite physical interconnection - a basis risk that's burned countless traders who assumed prices would converge.\n\nYou'll work through real calculations: shipping costs for Atlantic crossings, netback comparisons between European and Asian markets, and storage break-even analysis using German salt caverns. By the end, you'll see how global gas dynamics feed directly into the spark spread formulas you'll learn next.\n\nPhysical Foundations taught you why gas plants set marginal power prices. This guide shows you where gas prices come from - the global infrastructure that determines the fuel input cost. Next, you'll learn spark spreads (power minus gas minus carbon), which combine gas prices with power and carbon markets to identify profitable generation opportunities.\n\nComplete the Physical Foundations guide first. You need to understand merit order dispatch and why gas-fired plants are marginal price-setters. No prior trading experience required.\n\nTrack Henry Hub and NBP prices online or on TradingView for a month. When Henry Hub makes a significant move, set a calendar reminder for 6-8 weeks and check whether NBP followed. The lag will become intuitive, not theoretical.\n\nGet the complete guide in PDF format for offline reading and reference.",

I could say that and blame [the decision], but we will not grow up and move forward.\n\n\"It happened and it is not a surprise, it happened in the past when I arrived here. Honestly, we have to look at ourselves. If the players have excuses, we will be in trouble in the future.\n\n\"We have to look at ourselves and today the analysis is simple - Manchester United were better and we have to accept it.\"\n\nFormer Premier League official Darren Cann told BBC Sport he thought Dalot was \"very fortunate to escape a red card\".\n\n\"It's a hard one to see at normal speed live on the pitch from the referee's angle but with the benefit of replays I do feel that Dalot is very fortunate not receive a red card,\" he added.\n\n\"Had the referee been invited to the screen I am sure he would have been shown a red card.\"\n\nInterim United boss Carrick said: \"I am not giving you that [Guardiola's] answer, I have not seen it but I thought at the time Diogo got the ball and kicked it out. I did not think for one second it was a bad challenge. I got told later it was a lack of force [that meant he was not shown red].\"\n\nFollowing this loss and draws against Sunderland, Chelsea and Brighton, City are now winless in their last four league games and have handed a major advantage to Mikel Arteta's Arsenal.\n\nCity are close to completing the £20m signing of Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi to bolster the defence but the arduous schedule now appears to be catching up with City's front players.\n\nStriker Erling Haaland is in a barren run of form, scoring just once - from the penalty spot - in his last seven games and without a goal from open play since 20 December.\n\nThe Norwegian was out-battled by United defender Lisandro Martinez on Saturday, managing just 14 touches of the ball in the entire game and failing to manage a shot on target.\n\nPhil Foden has gone eight straight games without scoring while substitute Rayan Cherki, who scored late on at Newcastle during the week, was unable to influence the game.\n\nCity's expected goal (xG) rate of 0.45 in the contest was the second lowest recorded in Guardiola's 364 games in charge in the Premier League.\n\nThe 54-year-old, who celebrates his birthday on Sunday, told BBC Match of the Day: \"We were not good enough up front. We could not do it. I had a feeling we didn't have and they had it and they deserve it.\n\n\"Normally in the beginning of the game when they come to Etihad Stadium our rhythm is another one and it's normal doing that.\n\n\"Offensively we did not have the intention in the final third to score a goal, to make a cross, to make a movement. We were more predictable.\"\n\nCity will aim to get their season back on track with a trip to Bodo/Glimt in the Champions League on Tuesday.\n\nDespite boasting 68% of the possession, City were limited to one shot on target and the second lowest xG of Guardiola’s Premier League career.\n\nUnited looked to funnel City into wide areas before defending intensely with four players. On the left, for example, Bruno Fernandes, Patrick Dorgu, Kobbie Mainoo and Luke Shaw converged to reduce the time and space City had.\n\nThe number of players committed to the side the ball was on meant the space was on the far side, but City struggled to switch the point of attack, something Antoine Semenyo, Jeremy Doku and Rico Lewis do less of than some of their team-mates.\n\nPhil Foden on the right wing or Matheus Nunes have shown this ability in the past and the latter was a particular miss.\n\nCity lacked Nunes’ physical profile to help deal with United’s threat on transition by tracking the runs of Patrick Dorgu and aiding Rodri, who found himself having to deal with both Mbeumo and Bruno at times.\n\nWhen penned back, United defended in a way that gave time and space to the City centre-backs more than anybody else.\n\nBut, despite stopping numerous counter-attacks, when he had possession Abdukodir Khusanov struggled to take advantage of the spaces United left, as did Nathan Ake and Max Alleyne.\n\nTheir lack of ball-playing quality meant City struggled in a way they may not have done if they'd had the injured Josko Gvardiol, John Stones and Ruben Dias on the pitch.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 15 (Reuters) - India's Russian oil imports fell to their lowest level in two years in December, as Western sanctions pushed refiners to tap alternatives, ​lifting OPEC's share of imports to an 11-month high, trade data showed.\n\nLower imports of Russian ‌oil, sold at a discount, is likely to hit profits of refiners in the world's third largest oil importer and consuming ‌nation and push them to turn to suppliers in the Middle East, the U.S. and South America.\n\nTighter U.S. and European Union sanctions have slowed Russian oil flows to India, with imports dropping about 22% to 1.38 million barrels per day in December from the previous month, reducing Russia's share to 27.4%, the lowest since ⁠January 2023, while OPEC's share rose to ‌53.2%, the data showed.\n\nReliance Industries, the largest Indian buyer of Russian oil, stopped receiving crude under its deal with Rosneft in the final 10 days of December, ‍with its imports from Russia falling to a nearly two-year low, the data showed.\n\nState refiners, meanwhile, continued to source Russian oil from non-sanctioned suppliers.\n\nDespite the drop, Russia remained the top supplier of oil to India ​in December and during first nine of this fiscal year to March 31, 2026, followed by Iraq ‌and Saudi Arabia.\n\nSome cargoes that arrived in December, however, were discharged in January, the data showed.\n\nIndia's Russian oil imports are expected to average around 1.2 million to 1.4 million bpd in January, with the pullback looking more like a short-term disruption from compliance issues rather than India moving away from Russia completely, said Sumit Ritola, lead research analyst, refining and modelling at Kpler.\n\nTo keep track of refiners' oil purchases, ⁠the Indian government is seeking weekly details on crude purchases ​from Russia and the U.S.\n\nFor 2025, OPEC's share ​of India's crude imports edged up to 50%, from 49% from a year earlier, while Russia's portion shrank to 33.3% versus 36% in 2024.\n\nIndia emerged as the biggest ‍buyer of discounted Russian seaborne ⁠crude following the start of the Ukraine war in 2022.\n\nThe purchases have fuelled a backlash from Western nations, which have targeted Russia's energy sector with sanctions, arguing that oil revenues help ⁠fund Moscow's war effort.\n\nThe U.S. doubled import tariffs on Indian goods to 50% last year as punishment for its heavy purchasing ‌of Russian oil. The two countries are currently negotiating a potential trade deal.",

    "description": "Ukraine's capital Kyiv has only about half the electricity that it needs as it faces its most severe wartime energy crisis following waves",
    "fullText": "KYIV, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Ukraine's capital Kyiv has only about half the electricity that it needs as it faces its most severe wartime energy crisis following waves ​of Russian attacks on its infrastructure, mayor Vitali Klitschko told Reuters on Friday.\n\nKyiv, one of Eastern ‌Europe's largest cities, requires 1,700 megawatts of electricity to power the services for its 3.6 million people, Klitschko said.\n\nKlitschko said the current energy crisis ‌was the most difficult challenge facing the capital in the nearly four years since Russia's invasion in February 2022.\n\n\"It's the first time in the history of our city that, in such severe frosts, most of the city was left without heating and with a huge shortage of electricity,\" Klitschko, a former world heavyweight boxing champion, said in an interview ⁠in his office at the heart of ‌Kyiv.\n\nSome Kyiv residents face up to 18 to 20 hours a day without mains electricity. Ukraine declared an energy emergency this week as its grid crumbles due to accumulated wartime ‍damage and a new targeted wave of Russian bombardments.\n\nBitter cold weather with icy rain and snow exacerbated the challenges. Nighttime minimum temperatures have dipped to around -17 Celsius (1 Fahrenheit) in Kyiv this week.\n\nFAST REPAIRS, GENERATORS AND INTERNATIONAL AID\n\nKlitschko said Ukraine's international partners had ​rushed in additional generators, and repair teams had worked round the clock to restore heating following a Russian ‌strike last week that knocked out supplies to 6,000 apartment buildings.\n\nAbout 100 buildings still have no heating, he said.\n\n\"We're not just working during the day now, we're working at night too,\" he said. \"There is no such thing as the start and end of the working day for us.\"\n\nIn addition to repairs and generators, the city opened about 1,300 sites with heaters to help residents keep warm, and was working to install mini thermal power stations in ⁠some districts to decentralize electricity and heating.\n\nWith generators, the priority was ​to provide electricity to ensure water supplies and power hospitals, kindergartens, ​and other key critical infrastructure, Klitschko said. About 300 tonnes of fuel a day were needed to do that.\n\nKlitschko reiterated his call for Kyiv residents to leave the city if they ‍have the opportunity to do ⁠so to ease the pressure on its infrastructure.\n\nSchools in Kyiv extended their winter holidays, and many commercial companies have switched to remote work arrangements.\n\nKlitschko said that despite all the challenges, city officials were determined to ⁠restore heating supplies in full, and they were also planning for backup scenarios in case new Russian air strikes damage the energy infrastructure.\n\n\"This ‌winter will be difficult, but we are doing everything that's possible and impossible,\" Klitschko said.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Olena Harmash; editing by Daniel Flynn and Alex Richardson)",

    "description": "Destiny says witnesses quickly started pouring milk on her children to try and alleviate the effects of the tear gas.",
    "fullText": "A family of eight traveling in their car was caught in the crossfire between protestors and ICE agents in northern Minneapolis, and it led to three of their six children — including a six-month-old baby — being hospitalized. Well, I shouldn't really say crossfire, since one group was yelling and throwing snowballs while the other was using live munitions. I'll let you guess which was which.\n\nShawn Jackson, the children's father and the driver of the car, told FOX 9 KMSP at the scene that his children, who are between six months and 11 years old, were hurt when a flashbang stun grenade (or possibly tear gas) detonated nearby. As he stood next to his SUV, which was covered in some sort of chemical residue, Jackson told the reporter that the blast from the non-lethal (but incredibly dangerous) explosive device was strong enough to set off the airbags in what appears to be his GMT800 Chevy Tahoe.\n\nDespite the fact half of Jackon's kids ended up in the hospital, everyone involved is lucky things didn't end much, much worse. Here's what he and his wife, Destiny, told FOX 9:\n\n\"Officers threw flash bangs and tear gas in my car. I got six kids in the car [...] My 6-month-old can't even breathe. This was flipped over,\" Shawn said, holding up his child's car seat. \"My car filled with tear gas, I'm trying to pull my kids from the car.\"\n\nHis wife, Destiny Jackson, told FOX 9 their 6-month-old infant stopped breathing and lost consciousness. She then performed CPR on her baby while others poured milk on her other children in an effort to neutralize the tear gas.\n\nAlong with the six-month old, their 11-year-old and seven-year-old, who has asthma, were hospitalized. Both Jackson parents also had to be treated.\n\nPeople in the area quickly sprang into action to help the Jacksons. Destiny says witnesses quickly started pouring milk on her children to try and alleviate the effects of the tear gas. Others called EMS and coached her through CPR on her infant child.\n\n\"A lot of people from the community were there trying to help us in that situation,\" she said.\n\nI'm fairly certain there are quite a few people who are ready to type FAFO with a cry/laugh emoji into the comments section and say that they shouldn't interfere in government work, but before you do that, take a step back, reevaluate your life and listen to what I'm about to tell you. The Jacksons were not part of any protest.\n\nThey were on their way home from their oldest child's basketball game, and their route just so happened to go by the protests, which they weren't aware were happening. She says they did see police lights and protestors, but the road wasn't blocked and everything was fairly calm, so they continued on their way.\n\nWhile driving through, Shawn briefly stopped to ask people on the street what was happening, and that's when Destiny spotted her mother in the crowd and attempted to get her to leave, \"before anything did happen.\" Destiny says that after about half an hour of pleading with her mother to go home, she agreed, and as they were getting ready to go, ICE descended upon the scene in their cars.\n\n\"A couple of them proceeded to start screaming in my window, and they were saying, 'Get out of here. Get the F- out of here.'\" Destiny told FOX 9. She went on to say that she told the screaming ICE agents that if they moved away from their car, they would gladly leave, which is what they were trying to do the whole time.\n\n\"We know what happened when Renee tried to move. You guys said that she hit you when she didn't,\" Destiny said during the interview. It's not just Renee Good of course, 13 people have been shot at in their cars by ICE agents.\n\nAfter not moving their cars, the Jacksons were stuck. That's when ICE agents walked to the back of their vehicle and rolled a teargas bomb under it, and it went off, according to Destiny. Ghousling behavior.\n\n\"My kids were innocent, I was innocent, my husband was innocent, this shouldn't have happened,\" Destiny said. \"We were just trying to go home.\"\n\nWant more like this?

    "fullText": "A shriek broke the dawn on the savannah, followed by more screeches and the rustle of branches: The wild Fongoli chimps were bidding each other good morning in the dry, scraggly Sahel.\n\nThe rare chimpanzees -- who live in the bush of hot, southeast Senegal rather than the forest as is more common -- exist on the extreme edge of what is possible for their species.\n\nTheir unusual way of living offers clues into humans' own evolutionary past, while their adaptations to the heat appear timely in a world where temperatures are on the rise.\n\nSoaking in pools, cooling off in caves and even wielding spears: The 35 wild chimps of the Fongoli community have adapted to the environment with behaviours that defy their species' conventional norms.\n\nNow, 25 years after starting her pioneering research on savannah chimps, which had never before been habituated to observers, primatologist Jill Pruetz has a wealth of data.\n\nThe study's longevity allows for a deeper dive into the Fongoli community's behaviours, relationships and how they learn from one generation to the next.\n\n\"Until they were habituated to observers so we could follow them around and take data, we only knew chimpanzees from forested areas,\" Pruetz told AFP reporters, who spent two days following her and her team as they tracked the primates in the bush.\n\nThe Fongoli chimps, who live on a 100-square-kilometre (40-square-mile) home range, are only one group of savannah chimps in the region but for years the only one to be studied.\n\nOn a recent morning, A.J., Raffy, Diouf and ambitious young Pistache sat at the top of a baobab, plucking a breakfast of fruit that they cracked open with a whack-whack-whack against the branches.\n\nScreeching, or \"pant-hooting\" as their vocalisations are known, they communicated with other members nearby.\n\nPruetz and her team of Senegalese researchers follow the group's adult males, which currently number 10, choosing one each day to track from dawn to dusk. The females, however, are not followed in order to keep them more wary of poachers.\n\nThe males' strict hierarchy spans from Cy, the alpha, down to Siberut, the oldest and lowest ranking despite his superb hunting skills.\n\nSince the social apes spend much of their time together, Pruetz is still able to observe the females and their young.\n\nIt is the females who have proven the most groundbreaking members of the clan: They are the only non-human animal to systematically use tools to hunt.\n\nIt is a behaviour Pruetz and her researchers have observed almost 600 times.\n\nAfter whittling sticks into spears, usually with their teeth, the females hunt bush babies during the rainy season, impaling the small primates as they shelter in tree holes.\n\nWith the heat index reaching 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) in the hot season, life on the savannah can be gruelling.\n\nThe Fongoli chimps \"have to deal with the hottest area that we've studied chimps in\" Pruetz said, and must \"minimise energy expenditure\" during the dry season.\n\nThey are the only wild chimps in the world known to soak, taking dips in natural pools. They additionally \"use caves to rest in, because the caves are cooler\", Pruetz told AFP.\n\nThe savannah woodlands that are the Fongoli chimps' habitat are similar to those that human ancestors lived in some six or seven million years ago.\n\nWhile the Fongoli chimps' many adaptations mean they are able to deal with \"high heat stress\", Pruetz said, \"we're not sure that with climate change they can continue to do that\".\n\nThe Fongoli apes are members of the critically endangered subspecies of West African chimpanzees.\n\nWhile they have traditionally co-existed alongside humans on their home range, a new threat has emerged: a gold rush which has ushered an increase in both artisanal and industrial mines.\n\nIn the morning, the rumble of rock-grinding machines, which crush through buckets of substrate, could be heard before the savannah's fauna began its daily chorus.\n\nFires burned at artisanal mine sites, where night guards watched over equipment.\n\nMines can mean water pollution, greater resource extraction and the spread of human disease to chimps.\n\nPapa Ibnou Ndiaye, a wildlife researcher and professor at Cheikh Anta Diop University in Dakar, said studying the Fongoli chimpanzees allows \"the local administration to have accurate information to make informed decisions for the conservation of Senegal's biodiversity\".\n\nPruetz spends part of the year teaching at Texas State University, while her four research assistants and project manager, who are originally from nearby villages, continue to track the apes.\n\nThey keep count as Raffy whacks a baobab fruit eight times or note which arm he uses to do so -- although chimps are normally left-handed.\n\nBut they also meticulously track the chimps' friendships and social plights.\n\n\"When someone gets home from being out with the chimps all day, you sit around the supper table and you talk about, what drama? What did Cy do today? What did Pistache do today?\" said Pruetz, who has images of three of the chimp group's deceased or disappeared members tattooed on her arm.\n\nChimpanzees can live up to 50 years in the wild and how their \"relationships change\" is just one of the many interests for Pruetz.",

    "description": "The United States is considering whether to strike Iran as turmoil intensifies for the country’s authoritarian regime.",
    "fullText": "The United States is considering whether to strike Iran as turmoil intensifies for the country’s authoritarian regime.\n\nThe Iranian government is at its weakest point in years, destabilizing yet another OPEC nation less than two weeks after the United States toppled the government of Venezuela.\n\nProtests have erupted in the streets across Iran, and the government’s deadly crackdown on protesters crossed a red line President Donald Trump had drawn. Trump has signaled that his administration is weighing an attack – although on Wednesday, Trump said the United States will continue to “watch and see what the process is” to determine whether to take action against Iran.\n\nIran controls the third-largest proven oil reserves on Earth and one of the world’s most important oil shipping lanes. Those factors will shape the country’s future, regardless of whether the US intervenes.\n\nIran produces about 3.2 million barrels of oil per day, on average, according to OPEC, accounting for roughly 4% of global crude production. That makes Iran the world’s sixth-largest oil producer – an impressive feat, considering Iran faces burdensome worldwide sanctions that have severely limited its potential customers .To skirt sanctions, Iran operates a shadow fleet of vessels to export oil at a steep discount.\n\nBut Iran’s potential far outweighs its actual output. The country is sitting on 209 million barrels of oil in reserve, behind only Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. And its daily production is less than half the 6.5 million barrels per day Iran produced in the mid-1970s before revolutionaries overthrew the Shah.\n\nLike Venezuela, China is by far Iran’s biggest customer: It buys 89% of Iran’s oil, according to the US Energy Information Administration. The similarities don’t end there: Iran also nationalized the country’s energy infrastructure after expropriating foreign oil companies’ assets in past decades.\n\nBut Iran is a much more important for global energy than Venezuela.\n\n“Iran is significantly larger than Venezuela for oil markets,” said Luisa Palacios, a former Citgo chairwoman and current managing director of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “Developments for Iran matter much more for oil markets in the near term, because of the risk of oil supply disruption.”\n\nThe price of oil has already risen sharply because of the threat of disruption to Iran’s oil. Crude rose above $61 a barrel Wednesday in response to threats of an attack on Iran – just a week after oil fell to $56 a barrel when Trump promised US oil companies would ramp up production in Venezuela.",

    "fullText": "Russia could be staring down a painful financial reckoning in Venezuela after the US military operation on January 3 threw into doubt years of strategic investment and cooperation between Moscow and Caracas, according to a think tank analyst.\n\n\"Russian investments in Venezuela's oil industry over the last twenty years will now have to be, formally or informally, written off,\" wrote Stephen Sestanovich, the George F. Kennan senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, in a post on Wednesday.\n\nLoans for Venezuela's purchase of Russian weapons could meet the same fate, added Sestanovich, a former ambassador-at-large for the former Soviet Union at the State Department.\n\n\"The overall market appeal of such arms has clearly been diminished,\" following the US's military operation, he wrote.\n\nSome $2 billion to $3 billion in annual trade between Russia and Venezuela could also \"cease altogether,\" he added.\n\nThose concrete economic losses contrast with more intangible political upsides for Moscow in a shifting global order, he added.\n\n\"The Trump administration's emphasis on preserving a US sphere of influence in the Western Hemisphere could also seem to validate Russia's claims for a similar sphere in its own neighborhood,\" Sestanovich wrote.\n\nThe developments come at a sensitive moment for Russia's economy, as its war in Ukraine approaches its fifth year next month.\n\nSweeping Western sanctions and depressed oil prices are squeezing Russia's revenues, putting pressure on the funds Moscow uses to sustain the war effort and support the broader economy.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has not commented publicly on the US's operation in Venezuela. The Russian foreign ​ministry has called for deposed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's release and for dialogue between the US and Venezuela.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian state-owned oil company Roszarubezhneft sought to draw a line around its oil holdings in Venezuela. The company said earlier this week that all its assets in the South American country are \"owned by the Russian state.\"",

    "description": "Energy regulators and advocates are cautiously optimistic about Microsoft's promise to \"pay its own way\" for the power needed to serve its AI footprint.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft is promising to cover the costs of electricity needed to power its rapidly growing fleet of data centers in suburban and rural communities across the US.\n\nIn a speech on Tuesday, Brad Smith, the president and vice chair of the Big Tech giant, said that going forward, Microsoft will \"pay utility rates that are high enough to cover our electricity costs.\"\n\nIt's a bold pledge to make at a time when AI is fueling a historic surge in demand for power in the US, and electric bills are surging for the average American utility customer.\n\nIt is also one that state regulators have heard before as utilities, their data center customers, and consumer advocates argue over who will bear the cost of new infrastructure needed to serve AI's enormous appetite for power.\n\nBut as the impact of data centers on electricity rates becomes an increasingly hot political flashpoint, Microsoft may have no other choice but to follow through, and the rest of Big Tech might not be far behind.\n\n\"There is no free lunch for tech players, and Trump is watching,\" said Dan Ives, global head of tech research at Wedbush Securities.\n\nIves expects other Big Tech companies to follow Microsoft's lead and make similar pledges addressing local concerns around major data center buildouts sooner rather than later.\n\n\"I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,\" President Trump wrote Monday night in a post on Truth Social.\n\nThe \"big technology companies who build them,\" the president said, \"must pay their own way.\"\n\nTrump wrote that his administration had collaborated with Microsoft on the company's pledge to cover its electricity costs, and alluded to future announcements by other companies.\n\nWhen asked for further comment, the White House Press Office pointed to President Trump's post on Truth Social.\n\nMicrosoft's four-part plan to ensure it is paying its fair share of electricity costs was laid out in a blog post this week. The plan consists of asking utilities and regulators to set their rates high enough to cover their data center costs, collaborating with utilities to cover the costs of new infrastructure, looking for ways to operate data centers more efficiently, and advocating for affordable, reliable power at the state and federal levels.\n\nWhen asked for further comment, a spokesperson for Microsoft pointed to the company's blog post.\n\nConsumer advocates are cautiously optimistic about Microsoft's promise to pay its fair share, but eager to see more details — especially from the utilities that serve the data centers.\n\n\"These are only rough concepts that don't get at the root of the problem, which is the scale and speed at which the industry is moving,\" said Julie Bolthouse, director of land use at Virginia's Piedmont Environmental Council.\n\nDominion Energy, Virginia's largest public utility, has said it is in contract talks with data center customers for 47 gigawatts of new demand — double Dominion's current peak load.\n\nBolthouse is concerned about the legitimacy of that demand — and who might end up footing the bill if it never comes to fruition.\n\n\"The current process of unreviewed contracts between utilities and data centers has broken the planning process and threatens the reliability of the system,\" said Bolthouse.\n\nCharles Hua, founder and director of Powerlines, a nonprofit that advocates for utility regulation reform, said that data centers can be \"good grid citizens\" if local utilities prioritize investment in grid-enhancing technologies and energy efficiency over building new power plants.\n\n\"Doing so will require states to reimagine our outdated system of utility regulation and make necessary changes to center consumers going forward,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has made energy costs his latest affordability target, and he's zeroed in on data centers run by Big Tech firms.\n\nAccording to Wall Street tech bull Dan Ives, this complicates the picture for the AI buildout that's been underway for the last few years.\n\nTrump said on Monday that the administration was working with companies to \"secure their commitment to the American People.\" On Tuesday, Microsoft revealed plans aimed at reducing rising utility bills.\n\nIves said that Trump's focus on energy use among big data center players poses problems for the AI boom, and that the president's plan to have Big Tech firms \"pay their own way\" is a fresh headwind for the sector.\n\n\"This will create a larger bottleneck with big tech organizations looking to build out large data center footprints as quickly as possible without impacting the bottom-line, with this potentially slowing down the data center buildouts shortages/issues to fuel data center buildouts,\" he wrote.\n\nIves added that Trump's push comes at a time when the US tech sector is entering a key phase of what he calls the \"AI revolution,\" and that he expects more companies to soon follow Microsoft's lead.\n\n\"We expect other Big Tech organizations to follow soon after given the increased scrutiny from federal, state, and local governments to address major concerns with large-scale data center buildouts,\" he said.\n\nThe analyst acknowledged that the rapid data center expansion has played a part in rising electricity costs, but said he believes that the AI buildout has implications beyond the domestic economy.\n\nIves highlighted the possibility of the US falling behind China in the global AI arms race, something that Trump has said he does not want to happen. Ives suggested that impeding the industry's progress now could compromise the broader US AI agenda.\n\n\"We believe this will be a continuous back and forth battle between Big Tech players and the Trump administration with data center buildouts an important aspect of fueling the AI Revolution over the coming years,\" Ives added.",

    "fullText": "Global oil prices surged on Tuesday as markets reacted to the escalating drone strikes at the Novorossiysk terminal, which handles roughly 2% of the world's daily supply. The disruption to the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) infrastructure, a vital artery for Kazakh exports managed by Western majors like Chevron and Shell, raised immediate fears of a prolonged supply squeeze.\n\nWhile Brent was trading at $65.13, up 1.9%.\n\nTwo oil tankers waiting to load crude from some of Kazakhstan’s biggest oilfields were hit by drones at the marine terminal of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) near Novorossiysk on Russia’s Black Sea coast, sources told Reuters.\n\nThe Caspian Pipeline Consortium Marine Terminal, a major oil export facility close to Novorossiysk, handles most of Kazakhstan’s crude oil exports, as well as some Russian crude supply.\n\nThe Delta Harmony and the Matilda tankers were waiting to load crude from Tengizchevroil and Karachaganak, respectively, according to Reuters’ sources.\n\nTengizchevroil, operating the supergiant Tengiz oilfield in Kazakhstan, is managed by a consortium led by U.S. oil and gas supermajor Chevron. Karachaganak, another giant field in Kazakhstan, is operated by a consortium comprising Shell, Chevron, and Italy’s Eni, among others.\n\nDrone attacks at or near the CPC terminal have intensified in recent weeks and have affected the loading and departure schedules of Kazakhstan’s crude cargoes.\n\nKazakhstan’s oil output fell sharply at the end of November and early December after damage at the CPC export terminal disrupted flows. Output dropped in the first two days of December after storms and structural damage limited loading capacity at the Black Sea terminal, prompting producers to scale back throughput as storage filled.\n\nKazakhstan relies on the CPC for roughly 80% of its crude exports.\n\nThe disruption came at a sensitive moment for Kazakhstan, which was attempting to stabilize production following repeated CPC interruptions earlier in 2025.\n\nOil has continued to flow, but at lower rates, while Kazakhstan sought to re-route some exports away from the Black Sea to keep supply relatively steady.\n\nCPC operates the pipeline from the Caspian coast in northwest Kazakhstan to the Novorossiysk port, which handles 80% of Kazakhstan’s crude exports from giant oilfields operated by international oil firms.\n\nAffiliates of Chevron and ExxonMobil are also minority shareholders in CPC, with the Russian Federation as its largest shareholder with a 24% stake.",

    "fullText": "A Russian captain killed a crewman in an “entirely avoidable” collision with a US oil tanker in the North Sea, a court heard.\n\nCapt Vladimir Motin, 59, was on sole watch duty when his container ship collided into the Stena Immaculate, causing the death of Mark Angelo Pernia on March 10 last year.\n\nPernia had allegedly been working at the front of the Solong and died in the collision.\n\nOpening his Old Bailey trial on Tuesday, Tom Little KC, prosecuting, said the case involved the “entirely avoidable death” of the 38-year-old seaman Pernia.\n\nHe told jurors that the location of the Stena Immaculate would have been visible on the Solong’s radar display about 36 minutes before the vessels collided.\n\nMr Little said: “Despite an obvious collision course, the defendant did not deviate his vessel from its path and the impending catastrophe that lay ahead.\n\n“The defendant was responsible for navigating the ship, not only because he was the captain but because he was on sole watch duty at the time and ultimately, he did nothing, absolutely nothing, to avoid the collision.”\n\nMr Motin, from Primorsky, St Petersburg, is accused of manslaughter, Mr Little telling jurors that Pernia “would still be alive” if not for the Russian’s “grossly negligent” conduct.\n\nSolong, which was 130 metres long and weighed 7,852 gross tonnes, had departed Grangemouth in Scotland at 9.05pm on March 9 last year, bound for the port of Rotterdam.\n\nThe vessel, with a 14-strong crew, was carrying mainly alcoholic spirits and some hazardous substances, including empty but unclean sodium cyanide containers, the court was told.\n\nThe Stena Immaculate, with a crew of 23, was 183.2 metres long and was transporting more than 220,000 barrels of aviation fuel destined for the US military.\n\nIts engine was shut down on the evening of March 9. Restarting it would have taken about 30 to 45 minutes and about 35 minutes to manoeuvre away from an incoming ship, the court heard.\n\nThe two vessels crashed at about 9.47am on March 10, just over 12 hours after the Solong set off from Grangemouth.\n\nThe Solong had been travelling at just over 16 knots in the minutes before the collision and was going 15.2 knots on impact with no warning to the Stena Immaculate.\n\nPernia’s body has never been found.\n\nThe Solong was on a direct collision course for much longer than a matter of minutes, jurors were told.\n\nThe collision course was obvious when the tanker became visible to the naked eye and, before that, on computer equipment available to the defendant, Mr Little argued.\n\nMr Motin had a “constellation of information” telling him he needed to act but did the opposite and failed to avert the collision, the court heard.\n\nThere were a number of things the “highly trained” captain “could and should have done”, Mr Little said.\n\n“It is this gross breach of duty to the man he killed, and indeed to his own crew, that led inexorably to a death and to him being on trial before you at the Old Bailey,” the prosecutor said.\n\nMr Motin has denied manslaughter and the trial continues.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

Should Iran's regime fall and conflict in the region increase, that could result in a \"significant loss\" in oil production around the region, he wrote in a note to clients this week.\n\n\"Global and US equities are exposed to a correction in the near term given overvalued and overbought conditions and escalating geopolitical risk at the moment,\" Gertken added.\n\nAnalysts at Deutsche Bank also flagged the risk of the market experiencing an oil shock this year.\n\n\"A positive supply shock to oil prices would materially impact inflation expectations and inflation risks,\" the bank wrote in a recent client note, calling the scenario a key risk to their economic outlook.\n\nJeff Currie, a longtime commodities strategist and the chief strategy officer of energy pathways at Carlyle, added that he believes there could be further upside risk to oil prices. He pointed to factors such as high demand for crude and \"quite high\" geopolitical risk, which could make oil more expensive.\n\n\"The situation in Venezuela, the impact on geopolitical risk is very large,\" Currie told CNBC last week. \"For oil importers, whether you're China, India, or Europe, the world got a lot more dangerous.\"",

    "fullText": "LONDON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Global oil trading houses have emerged as early winners in the race to control Venezuelan crude flows, getting ahead of U.S. energy majors wary of credit and legal risks and securing a potentially lucrative business opportunity in the country with the world's largest crude reserves.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said U.S. majors would invest billions of dollars in Venezuela to quickly rebuild its dilapidated oil sector following the U.S. ​capture of President Nicolas Maduro earlier in January. Trump met top oil executives at the White House on Friday as his administration outlines a long-term plan to raise $100 billion to boost Venezuelan oil output.\n\nThe first companies to secure any business in the wake ‌of the U.S. military action in Caracas, however, were Dutch-based trader Vitol and Singapore-headquartered peer Trafigura, rather than U.S. majors.\n\nThe U.S. government tapped the giant merchant houses because they were better suited to quickly get Venezuelan oil exports flowing again, four industry sources familiar with the negotiations said. That is the first order of business for Washington before reconstruction ‌can begin, so that revenue from exports under U.S. supervision can fund the government of interim President Delcy Rodriguez in Caracas.\n\n\"Securing and marketing the initial barrels of Venezuelan crude oil was done at record speed to benefit both the American and Venezuelan people,\" a White House official told Reuters.\n\nVenezuela relies on oil exports for revenue, and has been starved of those proceeds for about a month under a blockade Trump imposed as he raised pressure on Maduro.\n\nWashington and Caracas are finalizing a $2 billion deal to sell up to 50 million barrels of crude to U.S. refiners and other buyers - oil that had been stuck on ships in Venezuelan waters and in storage tanks because of the blockade.\n\nFacilitating the initial oil sales was critical to ensure funds could flow back into Venezuela for everyday services and a process is in place to maintain the steady flow of production, sales, and refining of Venezuelan crude oil, the ⁠White House official said.\n\nTrafigura and Vitol have secured preliminary special licenses to negotiate and export the ‌Venezuelan crude, and Trafigura is set to load its first cargo this week, Chief Executive Richard Holtum said at the White House meeting with Trump.\n\nGLOBAL NETWORK ADDED TO TRADERS' APPEAL\n\nThe trading houses competed with Chevron to secure the supply deals. Chevron is the only U.S. oil major that operates in Venezuela, as a minority partner in joint ventures with Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA. Chevron has a license from U.S. authorities, which exempts it from ‍the sanctions the United States had imposed to choke off oil revenues to Maduro.",

    "description": "A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nThe grants supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, including battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and efforts to capture carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nThe Energy Department said the projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Russell Vought, the White House budget director, said on social media that “the Left’s climate agenda is being canceled.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said the administration’s action violated the Constitution’s equal protection requirements.\n\n“Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024,” Mehta wrote in a 17-page opinion. The administration offered no explanation for how their purposeful targeting of grant recipients based on their electoral support for Trump — or lack of it — “rationally advances their stated government interest,” the judge added.\n\nThe ruling was the second legal setback for the administration’s rollback of clean energy program in a matter of hours. A separate federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as Trump seeks to shut it down.\n\nA spokesman for the Energy Department said officials disagree with the judge’s decision on clean energy grants.\n\nOfficials “stand by our review process, which evaluated these awards individually and determined they did not meet the standards necessary to justify the continued spending of taxpayer dollars,” spokesman Ben Dietderich said. “The American people deserve a government that is accountable and responsible in managing taxpayer funds.”\n\nProjects were canceled in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state. All 16 targeted states supported Harris.\n\nThe cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.\n\nThe city of St. Paul and a coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit after they lost grants.\n\nTrump said in an interview last fall with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects that Democrats want. “I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said in the Oct. 1 interview.\n\nVickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the groups that filed the suit, said the court ruling “recognized that the Trump Department of Energy vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration, in violation of the bedrock Constitutional guarantee that all people in all states have equal protection under the law.”\n\nThe administration’s actions violated the Constitution, foundational American values and “imposed high costs on the American people who rely on clean affordable energy for their pocketbooks and for healthier lives,” Patton said.\n\nAnne Evens, CEO of Elevate Energy, one of the groups that lost funding, said the court ruling would help keep clean energy affordable and create jobs.\n\n“Affordable energy should be a reality for everyone, and the restoration of these grants is an important step toward making that possible,” she said.",

    "description": "Lower Chinese LNG demand could pressure global markets, especially as new U.S. and Qatari capacity comes online and Russian pipeline and LNG exports to China increase.",
    "fullText": "China is boosting domestic natural gas production, and it is doing it fast. A major LNG consumer—and importer—the country has been key in LNG demand forecasts. Now, these forecasts will need to be revised.\n\nLess than ten years ago, China was struggling to get its domestic gas production off the ground, especially in shale formations. China’s shale geology is different from the U.S. basins, and energy companies were finding it difficult to get commercial production going. Now, China’s state oil and gas majors are pumping more gas than ever and announcing new discoveries in the shale patch.\n\nIn November last year, China produced 22.1 billion cu m, which was a 7.1% increase on the year, Kpler reported this month citing official production data. The increase was driven by “faster-than-expected shale gas ramp-ups in the Sichuan Basin.” Based on that data, the energy analytics firm expects China’s total for 2025 to reach 263 billion cu m, rising to 278.5 billion cu m this year, again thanks to growing shale gas production in the Sichuan and Shanxi basins.\n\nAs with oil, rising domestic production would inevitably affect imports, even as China leans more heavily on natural gas for emission-reduction purposes. Last year, for instance, China booked higher domestic gas production and a rather substantial decline in LNG imports. In fact, imports of liquefied gas last year fell to the lowest in six years after a string of 12 monthly declines in a row. Imports only rebounded at the end of the year but not enough to reverse the decline. Kpler has predicted that Chinese demand for liquefied natural gas is going to decline this year as well, with shale gas production removing some 600,000 tons of LNG demand, reducing the total to 73.9 million tons.\n\nNow, 600,000 tons is not a whole lot in the context of a market where the United States alone exported over 100 million tons last year. But it does serve as yet another evidence of a trend in China to reduce dependence on energy imports, which has implications for global energy commodity markets that have gotten used to relying on China as the ultimate driver of demand.\n\nThe projected decline in China’s demand for gas—and by extension LNG—may interfere with new LNG capacity addition plans and prices, shrinking producers’ profits. It is these plans for a wave of new LNG supply, set to come online by the end of the decade, mostly from the top exporters, the United States and Qatar, that have prompted many analysts to expect an oversupplied LNG market by 2030 that would weigh on prices.",

    "fullText": "When Hollow Knight: Silksong came out last summer I was in so much pain that I didn’t know if I’d be able to play it. Could a video game teach me anything new about suffering?\n\nLast year I became uncomfortably well acquainted with suffering. In March I started experiencing excruciating pain in my right arm and shoulder – burning, zapping, energy-sapping pain that left me unable to think straight, emanating from a nexus of torment behind my shoulder blade and sometimes stretching all the way up to the base of my skull and all the way down into my fingers. Typing was agony, but everything was painful; even at rest it was horrible. I couldn’t play my guitar; I couldn’t play video games; I couldn’t sleep. I learned how quickly physical suffering lacerates your mental wellbeing.\n\nI’d had episodes of nagging pain from so-called repetitive strain injuries before, the product of long hours hunched over laptops and game controllers over the course of decades, but nothing like this. A few months later, after the initial unrelenting agony had subsided to a permanent hum of more moderate pain, it was diagnosed as brachial neuritis, inflammation of the nerve path that travels from the base of your neck down to your hand. (Nobody knows what causes it, but it sometimes happens after an infection or an injury.) The good news, I was told by a neurologist, was that it usually gets better in about one to three years, and I hadn’t lost any function in my right hand. The bad news was that there was nothing much to be done about the pain in the meantime.\n\nTraditional pain meds don’t really do much for nerve pain. And after trying out the small range of nerve pain medications – pills that act on the brain, where pain really lives – I discovered that they all sent me loopy in ways I would rather not ever experience again. So I had to figure out how to live with it. My nerves were upset; they had now learned the pain. It would take time to unlearn it.\n\nIn August, meanwhile, a small Australian developer called Team Cherry announced a release date for a game that had been in the works for many years. Silksong was the follow-up to Hollow Knight, a title I had loved when it came out in 2017: an atmospheric and enticingly challenging game about fighting your way through a corrupted underground bug kingdom. Silksong was so hotly anticipated that it became a meme; its name appeared in the comments under every gaming showcase for over half a decade, while Team Cherry remained resolutely silent about when it was coming out. Posters on Reddit started mock-ritually-sacrificing each other in an effort to manifest its release. Now it was finally coming out, and I was in so much pain that I didn’t know if I’d be able to play it.\n\nThere is an underlying narrative of overcoming the odds – of suffering and redemption – in almost all video games, but especially the difficult ones. And I love the difficult ones. Video games imbue suffering with meaning: you try and fail, try and fail, until you succeed. Perhaps, I thought, playing Silksong during a period of real-life suffering and disability might help me look at it differently.\n\nSilksong has the appearance of a very beautiful nightmare, and the energy of a horror-tinged European animated TV show you only half-remember from your childhood. Its player character, Hornet, is a masked spider in a red cloak; the other characters are oddly cute but dead-eyed bug creatures, hunched over with their own suffering. Beginning at the foot of the kingdom of Pharloom, you travel through moss-furred, luminescent caverns, moonlit temples, wind and sand-blasted wastelands, tight winding tunnels whose walls are made of cogs or tarnished bells, up towards the once gleaming Citadel at the top. Bugs have been making pilgrimages to the Citadel for untold generations but they rarely survive the journey. There is precious little life anywhere, and what there is will try to kill you. Something has poisoned their minds.\n\nThe journey mirrors Dante’s in The Divine Comedy from hell through purgatory to heaven, from cursed depths to the home of god. The piteous outpost where Hornet begins the game is little more than a shanty town; rag-clad bugs huddled in a place of temporary safety. The populace of Pharloom accepts their fate, cowering in every settlement with blank stares and sorrowful posture: this is how things are meant to be. Like any pilgrimage, the way to the Citadel involves enormous hardship before you come close to divinity. I was told this over and over by the bugs I met in between my battles with the feral beasts and corrupted priests that stood in my way – battles that often sent me back to a checkpoint, fuming, 10 or 20 or 50 times before I finally defeated them.\n\nExcept Silksong’s supposed heaven is hellish in itself. Once you get there, up to the Citadel – past the fog-wreathed swamp guarded by the vicious, flapping Moorwing, past the silk-wreathed Widow that holds the gilded town of Bellhart in a frightening state of suspended animation, past the Last Judge who guards the grand gate, swinging a flaming thurible that can end you in seconds with waves and columns of sweeping fire – you find that it has fallen, too. There is no point to the suffering of the pilgrims who come here. If they survive, there is only more suffering ahead. The highest places turn out to be some of the worst.\n\nThe Citadel is barely the halfway point of the game, however. Past that gate, Pharloom branches in all directions. Deep, deep below, there is a roiling furnace; in Sinners Road you find where the prisoners of the realm have been left to rot; there is an abandoned hospital, a pitiless wind-whipped mountain of ice, a museum of sorts that takes you through the realm in miniature (why is it there?). The guardians of these places become ever more punishing. I nearly lost my mind fighting Trobbio, the dancer, the flamboyant performer, trapped for ever on his stage, theatrically intoning his own name as he destroys me with pyrotechnics.\n\nHornet gleams silk-bright in this dismal world. Within her is the substance that holds Pharloom’s minds in thrall, the godly silk. She whips her divine power around herself like ribbons, to heal the damage done to her. She speaks with clarity and compassion, to bugs that respond in riddles or threats, half-mad. She plucks melodies on a stringed instrument that make the bugs around her turn their faces upwards and sing in disconnected couplets. And she fights: with her sharp-pointed needle, with bone-crafted boomerangs and plant-poison and flea-brew, with sharp tacks and javelin-spears and anything else she can find in Pharloom. She fights and fights, and yet beyond each battle waits another.\n\nHampered by pain, I am forced to explore all of this very, very slowly. It takes me months to make my way painstakingly through a game I would have rinsed in three weeks in my previous life. My pilgrimage cannot be rushed. A lot of managing pain involves cultivating a state of safety for your nervous system, minimising stress as much as possible, and it turns out that difficult video games are very stressful. The frustration of failure causes my hands to grip the controller too hard and my fingers begin to hurt. The adrenaline of victory sends me into a state of exhilarated fight-or-flight that my nerves can’t currently handle. Instead of disappearing into Silksong like I have with other games since I was a teenager, I play for 20, 40 minutes at a time, over months.\n\nUnexpectedly, this makes Pharloom begin to feel like a parallel dimension, somewhere I can slip into not just on my Nintendo Switch but in my mind. I have to stop playing when pain starts to travel to my hand, so I keep playing it in my head.\n\nI see the Cogwork Dancers, the balletic mechanical twin bosses at the very top of the Citadel, flitting in front of my mind’s eye in their predictable attack patterns. I think about the shaft I found in a corner of the Blasted Steps and wonder whether I can get up there with the piton-like tool that Hornet recently acquired. I think, all the time, about what happened in Pharloom; the clawed grip of religion on the minds of its populace, who cling to their rosary beads even as they lose their grasp on their own minds. I think about the tall princeling I rescued from a cell, crouched over the remains of one of the Cogwork Dancers: his partner, long ago.\n\nYou can tell that this game is a work of obsession. The detail everywhere is extraordinary, even in the writhing maggots that carpet the ground in the aptly named Putrified Ducts. But also, where in most game worlds everything feels oriented towards the player – fun playgrounds laid out for your enjoyment, a daub of yellow paint here and there to show you where to go – Hornet’s presence, my presence, feels almost incidental to Pharloom. It rots away without me, bugs chanting their devotions, patrolling silk-poisoned clerics clanging their bells. I come upon a settlement and am not welcomed as a saviour, but regarded through a veil of suspicion and despair.\n\nIndeed, some places in Pharloom aren’t fun at all. They’re places I never want to see again. Late one night I find myself in Bilewater, a fetid parkour course over more pools of writhing maggots and past bile-spitting moss-monsters. I am here to find Shakra the warrior-cartographer, whose haunting song has guided me towards her throughout Pharloom, scrabbling for rosaries to pay for her maps. Her trail is marked with bronze rings, a detail I can’t believe I didn’t notice earlier in the game, but it takes me days of spaced-out play to make the journey from the nearest safe bench to the tranquil pool where she rests. Trickster creatures follow me, setting tripwires and traps that make it even harder to avoid the gaping mouths, slashing teeth and erratic movements of the native creatures here. It brought me to the verge of tears.\n\nGiving up never felt like an option. I’ve taken breaks from Silksong – a week or two at a time – but I have not given up, not even when I got stuck in an almost-impossible gauntlet involving waves of aggressive crows. Silksong feels like a sadistic game at times, needlessly punishing: take a hit and it’ll often wipe not one but two precious units of Hornet’s health. I’m not sure why I didn’t quit. It wasn’t pure obstinacy. I think that because I was suffering all of the time anyway, adding a bit more suffering into my days by choice at least gave me a feeling of control.\n\nDifficult video games require tenacity and resilience. Keep throwing yourself at the problem unrelentingly until you defeat it, they teach you. There’s nothing you can’t do with enough skill and determination. You can always win. You just have to try hard enough.\n\nThis does not apply to pain. No amount of effort will persuade nerves to heal any faster, and pain is not something that can be overcome with sheer determination. I’ve carried plenty of strategies from video games into my real life before: I have applied the same bullheaded tenacity to learning languages, writing books, supporting and caring for my friends and family. But nothing I’ve ever learned from video games has helped me deal with pain. Instead I’ve had to learn how to do things more slowly, stay within my capacity, and admit my limitations without guilt or self-admonishment.\n\nI did not know that I could do things slowly. I didn’t know that I would be able to play Silksong slowly. But I have learned how. As I have been playing through this game I have also been reading endlessly about modern pain science. At first I was doing this rather desperately, in search of a way out, a way to speed things up, to get myself out of suffering. What I learned instead is that acknowledging pain is the first step to learning to live with it, and that learning to live with it is what it actually means to overcome it. Pain is the brain’s danger signal: if you ignore it, it only gets louder. If you start listening instead, observing and acquiescing, your brain might put away the megaphone. I have learned that acknowledging pain and modifying your life around it does not mean giving up. It means you get to keep on living – keep on playing.\n\nAfter four months and 40 hours, I have done almost everything there is to do in Pharloom. I am fighting the very final boss, and I have been trying to defeat her since before Christmas. I hoped I might finish this game before the end of 2025, a neat little piece of symbolism to represent perseverance through an extremely challenging year. It hasn’t worked out quite so elegantly, but Silksong has helped me look at suffering a little differently. There doesn’t need to be a point to it; it doesn’t necessarily come with a tidy narrative of perseverance and eventual redemption. But you can learn to work around it. You can make your way through.\n\nSuper Nintendo: How One Japanese Company Helped the World Have Fun by Keza MacDonald is out 12 February (Guardian Faber Publishing, £20).

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump says US companies will now have access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves. But the country’s other commodities have also caught his administration’s attention.\n\nVenezuela has unverified amounts of minerals, metals and potentially rare earth elements, experts say. These raw materials are indispensable for industries from defense to technology, and the administration has repeatedly stressed their importance for US national security.\n\nBut while Washington might aspire to secure Venezuela’s critical elements, it’s a tall order, experts say, and wouldn’t do much to bolster America’s supply chain.\n\nThe quantity and economic viability of Venezuela’s mineral resources are uncertain. Companies also face major risks mining in Venezuela without sustained security guarantees.\n\nMany of these regions have guerrilla soldiers and armed groups engaging in illegal gold mining, experts say. Energy-intensive rare earths mining can also harm the environment.\n\n“There is an awareness within the administration that even beyond oil, there’s wider natural resource value in the country,” said Reed Blakemore, director of research at the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center.\n\n“However, if we’re talking about the conditions under which we are able to exploit those mineral resources and bring them to market, it’s a much more challenging story,” Blakemore said. “And even, frankly, more challenging than the oil story.”\n\nEven if US companies were to try to mine Venezuela’s rare earths, getting them out of the ground is just one part of the process. Those materials are usually sent to China for refining.\n\nChina accounted for over 90% of global rare earths refining in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency. The country maintains a virtual monopoly in processing and refining the materials due to decades of government subsidies, industry expansion and lax environmental regulations.\n\nRare earths have become a major sticking point in US-China trade tensions. Beijing last year implemented some export controls on rare earths during trade spats, raising concerns about America’s lack of secure supply chains for these critical materials.\n\n“China still holds near-singular capacity to process rare earth metals, and that industrial and geopolitical edge cannot be overcome overnight,” said Joel Dodge, director of industrial policy and economic security at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator.\n\nThe US Geological Survey designates 60 “critical minerals” vital to economic and national security.",

    "description": "Hundreds of miles above the Arctic Circle, an American oil company is attempting to extract billions of barrels of oil on Greenland, just as Trump is escalating tensions with the territory.",
    "fullText": "TASIILAQ, GREENLAND — Oil executives looking for the next massive source of petroleum have turned toward the Arctic for decades. Studies by the US government suggest the area above the Arctic Circle could hold as many as 90 billion barrels of oil and nearly 1,700 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.\n\nThe oil alone would be enough to sustain the entirety of global demand for nearly three years if all other drilling worldwide were to cease tomorrow.\n\nAt the center of these ambitions is Greenland, where some of the harshest conditions on Earth protect stores that have drawn in prospectors looking for the chance at another discovery the size of Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay.\n\nA company called March GL, which will be renamed Greenland Energy Company after it goes public this year, is hoping to vault itself into the upper echelons of the industry by extracting some of these billions of barrels of oil from a peninsula called Jameson Land sticking off the eastern coast of Greenland, the largest island in the world. The oil could be transformative for the US and European markets likely to receive it, injecting a massive wave of new supply that could help wean Europe from its dependence on Russian petroleum, currently under a steep sanctions regime as its war in Ukraine rages on.\n\nIn late October, Yahoo Finance accompanied March GL CEO and veteran oilman Robert Price, alongside the company’s lead petroleum engineer, to a town called Tasiilaq on Greenland’s eastern coast, where March GL’s contractors were preparing to store a collection of heavy machinery in town for the winter.\n\nPrice had been planning to barge the earthmovers up to Jameson Land, where they would begin constructing a three-mile-long road from the coast to the inland site where March GL will be drilling its first wells. Rough seas off the island’s eastern coast left the tugboat with which the company planned to haul the equipment unable to make the journey; by late autumn, the window of ice-free water to make this trip was closing too quickly to wait for a new one.\n\nInstead, March GL’s team will keep much of its equipment in Tasiilaq until the spring or summer, when the ice will thaw, compressing their timelines — a testament to the tenuous-at-best operating conditions in Greenland.\n\nSince that trip, the complexities of Price’s Greenland ambitions have only increased.\n\nAfter the arrest and extraction of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in early January, President Trump renewed his push to annex the Danish autonomous territory. Trump said during a press briefing on Jan. 4 that “we need Greenland” to protect US national security interests in the Arctic, comments which set off a wave of pushback from the Greenlandic and Danish governments.",

    "description": "U.S.",
    "fullText": "HAVANA/HOUSTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday said no more Venezuelan oil or money will go to Cuba and suggested the Communist-run island should strike a deal with Washington, ramping up pressure on the long-time U.S. nemesis and provoking defiant words from the island's leadership.\n\nVenezuela is ​Cuba's biggest oil supplier, but no cargoes have departed from Venezuelan ports to the Caribbean country since the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by U.S. forces ‌in early January amid a strict U.S. oil blockade on the OPEC country, shipping data shows.\n\nMeanwhile, Caracas and Washington are progressing on a $2 billion deal to supply up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil to the U.S. with ‌proceeds to be deposited in U.S. Treasury-supervised accounts, a major test of the emerging relationship between Trump and interim President Delcy Rodriguez.\n\n\"THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO! I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sunday.\n\n\"Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela,\" Trump added.\n\nCuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel rejected Trump's threat on social media, suggesting the U.S. had no moral authority to force a deal on Cuba.\n\n\"Cuba is a free, independent, and sovereign nation. Nobody dictates what ⁠we do,\" Diaz-Canel said on X. \"Cuba does not attack; it has ‌been attacked by the U.S. for 66 years, and it does not threaten; it prepares, ready to defend the homeland to the last drop of blood.\"\n\nThe U.S. president did not elaborate on his suggested deal.\n\nBut Trump's push on Cuba represents the latest escalation in his move to bring regional ‍powers in line with the United States and underscores the seriousness of the administration's ambition to dominate the Western Hemisphere.\n\nTrump's top officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have made no secret of their expectation that the recent U.S. intervention in Venezuela could push Cuba over the edge.\n\nU.S. officials have hardened their rhetoric against Cuba in recent weeks, though the two countries have been at odds since former leader Fidel Castro's ​1959 revolution.\n\nCuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said in another post on X on Sunday that Cuba had the right to import fuel from any suppliers willing to ‌export it. He also denied that Cuba had received financial or other \"material\" compensation in return for security services provided to any country.\n\nThirty-two members of Cuba's armed forces and intelligence services were killed during the U.S. raid on Venezuela. Cuba said those killed were responsible for \"security and defense\" but did not provide details on the arrangement between the two long-time allies.\n\nCuba relies on imported crude and fuel mainly provided by Venezuela, and Mexico in smaller volumes, purchased on the open market to keep its power generators and vehicles running.\n\nAs its operational refining capacity dwindled in recent years, Venezuela's supply of crude and fuel to Cuba has fallen. But the South American country is still the largest provider with some 26,500 barrels per day exported last year, according to ship ⁠tracking data and internal documents of state-run PDVSA, which covered roughly 50% of Cuba's oil deficit.\n\nEven before Maduro's ​capture, Cuba had been struggling to keep the lights on. Vast swaths of the island live without electricity for ​much of the day, and even the capital Havana has seen its economy crippled by hours-long rolling blackouts.\n\nShortages of food, fuel and medicine have put Cubans on edge and have prompted a record-breaking exodus, primarily to the United States, in the past five years.\n\nMexico has emerged in recent ‍weeks as a critical alternative oil supplier to ⁠the island, but the supply remains small, according to the shipping data.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum last week said her country had not increased supply volumes, but given recent political events in Venezuela, Mexico had turned into an \"important supplier\" of crude to Cuba.\n\nU.S. intelligence has painted a grim picture of Cuba's economic and political situation, but its assessments offer ⁠no clear support for Trump's prediction that the island is \"ready to fall,\" Reuters reported on Saturday, citing three people familiar with the confidential assessments.\n\nThe CIA's view is that key sectors of the Cuban economy, such as agriculture and ‌tourism, are severely strained by frequent blackouts, trade sanctions and other problems. The potential loss of oil imports and other support from Venezuela could make governing ‌more difficult for Diaz-Canel.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Ukrainian drone strike sparked a fire at an oil depot in Russia’s southern Volgograd region, officials said Saturday, after Russia launched a powerful hypersonic missile along with drones and other weapons that disrupted Kyiv's power supply and heating.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of casualties, Volgograd Gov. Andrei Bocharov was quoted as saying in a Telegram post published on the channel of the local administration. The post did not specify the damage, but said that people living near the depot may have to be evacuated.\n\nUkraine’s General Staff said Saturday it had struck the Zhutovskaya oil depot overnight. In a statement on Telegram, it said the depot is supplying fuel to Russian forces, adding that damage was being assessed.\n\nUkraine’s long-range drone strikes on Russian energy sites aim to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue its full-scale invasion. Russia wants to cripple the Ukrainian power grid, seeking to deny civilians access to heat, light and running water in what Kyiv officials say is an attempt to “weaponize winter.”\n\nSaturday's attack came the day after Russia bombarded Ukraine with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles overnight into Friday, according to Ukrainian officials, killing at least four people in the capital. For only the second time in the nearly 4-year-old war, it used a powerful new hypersonic missile that struck western Ukraine in a clear warning to Kyiv’s NATO allies.\n\nThe intense barrage and the launch of the nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile followed reports of major progress in talks between Ukraine and its allies on how to defend the country from further Moscow aggression if a U.S.-led peace deal is struck.\n\nStéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, said Friday's attacks “have resulted in significant civilian casualties and deprived millions of Ukrainians of essential services, including electricity, heating and water at a time of acute humanitarian need.”\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said heat supply would be fully restored in Kyiv by the end of Saturday.\n\nShe said areas on the right bank of the Dnieper River would gradually lift emergency blackouts and return to scheduled outages. But resuming power supply on the left bank, where Russian attacks were concentrated, is more complicated due to significant damage to the power grid, she added.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said Saturday that its forces used aviation, drones, missiles and artillery to strike Ukrainian energy facilities and fuel-storage depots.\n\nRussia struck Ukraine with 121 drones and one Iskander-M ballistic missile, according to the Ukrainian air force. It said 94 drones were shot down.\n\nSeparately, the Russian Defense Ministry said 59 Ukrainian drones were neutralized overnight over Russia and occupied Crimea.\n\nUkraine's military said that besides the oil depot in Volgograd, it had struck a drone storage facility belonging to a unit of Russia’s 19th Motor Rifle Division in Zaporizhzhia, southern Ukraine, as well as a drone command and control point near the eastern city of Pokrovsk.\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "Meta Platforms is turning to nuclear power to drive its AI ambitions, and its latest deal with a trio of companies is sending stocks in the sector soaring.\n\nThe tech giant revealed that it signed an agreement with several companies to help supply nuclear power for its data centers, including the massive Prometheus AI supercluster being built in New Albany, Ohio. The one gigawatt facility is expected to come online later this year.\n\nThe three companies that will help power it are Oklo, Vistra Corp, and privately held TerraPower. Both nuclear power stocks surged on news of the Meta deal, sparking momentum for many of their peers as well.\n\nHere are the big moves in the space on Friday:\n\nThis isn't the first nuclear power deal that Meta has inked. Last summer, it announced a similar agreement with Constellation Energy, which saw its shares spike on the news.\n\n\"State-of-the-art data centers and AI infrastructure are essential to securing America's position as a global leader in AI,\" said Joel Kaplan, chief of global affairs at Meta. \"Nuclear energy will help power our AI future, strengthen our country's energy infrastructure, and provide clean, reliable electricity for everyone.\"\n\nBig tech's support of nuclear energy has risen in recent years as experts have touted the need for alternative sources of power to enable the AI buildout. Oklo is backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, though he stepped down from his position as chairman of its board of directors in August 2025.\n\n\"Two years ago, Oklo shared its vision to build a new generation of advanced nuclear powerhouses in Ohio,\" Oklo CEO Jacob DeWitte said. \"Today, that vision is becoming a reality through the support of a multi-year effort with Meta.\"",

    "fullText": "The US military said on Friday that it \"apprehended\" an oil tanker in a pre-dawn operation in the Caribbean Sea, marking the fifth seizure of a Venezuela-linked vessel allegedly operating in violation of sanctions.\n\nUS Southern Command said in a statement that Marines and sailors, working in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, launched from the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford and captured the tanker, Olina, \"without incident.\"\n\nIt appears to be the first time that the US has directly acknowledged the Ford's involvement in the five boarding and seizure operations that began in early December. However, the government has indicated that the carrier was used for at least one of the other missions.\n\nThe Ford is the Navy's largest, newest, and most advanced aircraft carrier. It carries dozens of embarked fighter jets, early warning planes, and helicopters and was deployed to the Caribbean in the fall as part of the massive build-up of military forces in the region.\n\nLast year, the US imposed sanctions on Olina, which was flying the flag of Panama and named Minerva M at the time, according to a Treasury Department document.\n\nData from MarineTraffic, a ship-tracking site, showed that the tanker was off Venezuela's coast several weeks ago and was sailing under the flag of Timor-Leste.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Olina a \"ghost fleet\" tanker that was suspected of carrying embargoed oil and \"had departed Venezuela attempting to evade US forces.\"\n\nThe US announced a naval blockade on sanctioned oil tankers trying to enter or leave Venezuela last month as part of an effort to pressure the country's then-President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nThe operation on Friday marks the third tanker seizure this week. US forces captured two vessels on Wednesday: one in the North Atlantic after a dramatic, weekslong chase and another near the Caribbean. The American military boarded two other vessels — Skipper and Centuries — last month.\n\n\"The ghost fleets will not outrun justice. They will not hide under false claims of nationality,\" Noem said on Friday, adding that the US will continue to seize sanctioned tankers.\n\nThe Trump administration's pressure campaign against Maduro and Venezuela, which included the naval blockade, also consisted of the deployment of warships, military aircraft, and thousands of troops to the Caribbean.\n\nSince early September, US forces have carried out dozens of airstrikes on alleged drug boats, with President Donald Trump routinely suggesting that he may take action against Venezuela.\n\nTensions between Trump and Maduro culminated last weekend in a dramatic surprise operation and raid to capture the former Venezuelan president.\n\nIn the days since, Trump has threatened additional action against neighboring countries, including Mexico, Cuba, and Colombia.\n\nA US official told Business Insider on Thursday that the 12 Navy warships deployed to the Caribbean before the Maduro raid were still in the region, with no scaling down of forces yet.",

    "description": "Quantum computing has long promised transformative advances in data analysis, yet practical quantum machine learning has remained elusive due to fundamental obstacles such as a steep quantum cost for the loading of classical data and poor trainability of many quantum machine learning algorithms designed for near-term quantum hardware. In this work, we show that one can overcome these obstacles by using a linear Hamiltonian-based machine learning method which provides a compact quantum representation of classical data via ground state problems for k-local Hamiltonians. We use the recent sample-based Krylov quantum diagonalization method to compute low-energy states of the data Hamiltonians, whose parameters are trained to express classical datasets through local gradients. We demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of the methods by performing experiments on benchmark datasets using up to 50 qubits of an IBM Heron quantum processor.",

    "description": "Ukrainian cities have set up hundreds of \"invincibility points\" in preparation for a rare mass blackout event like this week's.",
    "fullText": "A new wave of Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure has put two of its biggest regions to the test, as local cities rolled out plans for dealing with their worst blackouts in years.\n\nTheir prepared \"blackout mode\" response provides some insight into how urban centers might steel themselves for energy crises in wartime, especially during cold months. Ukraine's winter can turn brutal in January and February, when temperatures typically drop to 18°F.\n\nMass blackouts can also disrupt water and sewage systems, hospitals, public transportation, and road control, including traffic lights.\n\nBoth Ukrainian troops and civilians have long learned to cope with frequent energy shortages in the winter, maintaining backup generators, battery-powered lamps, and stockpiles of coal or gas.\n\nBut Moscow's latest attacks on Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk, two eastern Ukrainian regions, plunged both areas into almost total darkness this week.\n\nRegional leaders have described it as their biggest energy crisis since 2022, when Ukrainians first faced wartime power outages. Borys Filatov, the mayor of Dnipro, Dnipropetrovsk's largest city, said the situation there was one of the most severe in the country and had risen to the level of a \"national emergency.\"\n\n\"This is the first total blackout in the entire region in recent years,\" Ivan Fedorov, Zaporizhzhia's governor, said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nAs national authorities reported that over 1 million people had lost heat and water, local officials rushed to restore power and open access to facilities prearranged for the blackouts.\n\nOne of their prepared responses was to deploy \"invincibility points,\" or earmarked emergency shelters equipped with heat, communication, and basic necessities.\n\nSome local governments publish a map with available locations for civilians. The city of Dnipro, for example, maintains a list of mostly schools, municipality buildings, and metro stations designated as safe spots.\n\nCivilians are meant to visit these shelters to \"warm up, charge your gadgets, and wait out the power outage,\" per the municipal government.\n\nA video published by Oleksy Kuleba, Ukraine's vice prime minister for reconstruction and the minister for community and territorial development, showed one point in Dnipropetrovsk that appears to be located in a small convenience store.\n\nKuleba said the region's energy sector had been hit with a \"massive blow,\" and that over 5,000 people visited 500 such locations in the city of Dnipro within 24 hours after the power outages began.\n\nKuleba added that neighboring regions in Ukraine had donated 45 generators to Dnipropetrovsk, where some of its trains had switched to burning onboard fuel for power.\n\nZaporizhzhia's governor, Fedorov, also said on Thursday that the region had 400 established invincibility points, with 200 ready for visitors within two hours.\n\n\"Residents could warm up, call their relatives, drink hot tea, and, if necessary, stay overnight,\" he said.\n\nFilatov, Dnipro's mayor, said on Thursday that the city had set up 130 water dispensers, which his staff marked on Google Maps, and that disrupted public transport would be temporarily replaced by buses.\n\nHospitals were already equipped with alternative power sources and necessities, while parts of the city, on the western bank of the Dnipro River, were supported by backup power, he added.\n\n\"The city's sewage system is also powered,\" Filatov said.\n\nNotably, Filatov said that while authorities had extended local school holidays to January 11, kindergartens would operate on four-hour shifts \"because it's clear that parents are also in a difficult situation.\"\n\nIn Zaporizhzhia, Fedorov said the region had been left \"completely without electricity\" on Wednesday evening.\n\n\"We immediately went into 'blackout' mode and started working according to a clear plan,\" he said.\n\nZaporizhzhia's hospitals similarly switched to backup power within minutes, and the region's traffic lights \"worked autonomously,\" he added.\n\nUkrainian officials have since said that power has been partially returned to both regions, with Kuleba reporting on late Thursday evening that water and heating in Dnipropetrovsk had been restored to over 1.7 million people and 270,000 people, respectively.\n\nEnergy supplier DTEK said that around 700,000 families in the Dnipropetrovsk region once again had access to electricity, though it added that Russian bombing was continuing.\n\n\"An exhausting day for energy workers in the Dnipropetrovsk region,\" the company said.\n\nFedorov warned repeatedly on Thursday evening of incoming drone and guided missile strikes over Zaporizhzhia. He later said that Russia had carried out over 728 strikes, including drone attacks, artillery shelling, and multiple-launch rocket system strikes across Ukraine that day.\n\nBoth Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk are close to the southern and eastern front lines in Ukraine.\n\nKyiv has often accused Russia of specifically targeting energy infrastructure during the winter to exhaust and punish Ukrainian civilians, which is a war crime but is often difficult to prove.\n\nThe Kremlin has often responded that its strikes were intended for legitimate military targets, though the years have shown that critical facilities are regularly damaged or destroyed by the attacks.\n\n\"There is no military sense in such strikes on the energy sector, on infrastructure, which leave people without electricity and heating in winter conditions,\" said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday.",

    "description": "When it comes to claiming that Venezuelan oil is now under his control, President Donald Trump is mincing no words.  After all, Trump is expected to visit Beijing in April as part of an effort to protect the fragile trade truce he reached with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last year.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — When it comes to claiming that Venezuelan oil is now under his control, President Donald Trump is mincing no words. But no small part of that oil belongs to China under contracts it struck with Caracas years ago, setting the stage for a delicate diplomatic dance in the next few weeks.\n\nSome experts expect Trump to work with China in an effort to stabilize trade relations. After all, Trump is expected to visit Beijing in April as part of an effort to protect the fragile trade truce he reached with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last year.\n\n“The administration appears focused on avoiding unnecessary escalation or new irritants with Beijing while keeping leverage firmly on Washington’s terms,” said Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nHe added that he doubted Trump would risk turning Venezuela into a “flashpoint that complicates trade dynamics or Trump’s personal engagement with Xi.”\n\nChina is owed at least $10 billion from Venezuela, according to various estimates, a debt that former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro had paid down by shipping oil to China. It is possible that the interim Venezuelan government complying with Washington’s demands could question the legality of those loans-for-oil deals and cease payments.\n\nTwo major Chinese state-owned enterprises — China National Petroleum Corp. and Sinopec — are entitled to 4.4 billion barrels of oil reserves in Venezuela, the highest for any foreign country, according to a research note by the investment bank Morgan Stanley.\n\nU.S. companies also have claims for tens of billions of dollars from when Caracas nationalized the oil industry, and it’s not clear how these IOUs will be honored and in what order.\n\nThe U.S. seized two sanctioned oil tankers this week as part of a plan to assert control over Venezuelan oil shipments. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the U.S. will handle the sales of Venezuela’s oil “indefinitely,” depositing proceeds into U.S.-controlled accounts that will ultimately “flow back into Venezuela to benefit the Venezuelan people.”\n\nThe administration said this week that the U.S. would kickstart those sales with 30 million to 50 million barrels taken from the South American country’s crude storage facilities. Asked for more detail, a Trump administration official not authorized to comment publicly and speaking on condition of anonymity said U.S. policy was to wind down “adversarial outside influence” in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe U.S. using such leverage over a crucial natural resource comes after Beijing flexed its muscles last year by choking off critical supplies of rare-earth magnets and weaponizing its purchase of American soybeans in the trade war with Washington. When Trump met Xi in South Korea in October, the two men agreed to a one-year truce, backing off from sky-high tariffs and export controls on each other.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2023, Venezuela was the fourth-largest recipient of Beijing's official credit, having received $106 billion worth of loans from China’s official-sector creditors, according to AidData, a research lab at Virginia's College of William & Mary that tracks Beijing's overseas lending activities. But how much of the total that Caracas has paid off and what is still owed is unclear, said AidData executive director Brad Parks, because Caracas stopped reporting debt details several years ago.\n\nWhile some estimates put the outstanding debt at $10 billion, Parks said the figure could be much higher because U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan oil might have delayed loan repayments. The loans from China, under an unusual arrangement, were set up to be paid down with proceeds from oil exports.\n\nIn China, the capture of Maduro evoked memories of another leader who had struck deals with Chinese companies and then suddenly lost power: Libya's Moammar Gadhafi.\n\nAfter the 2011 fall of Gadhafi, Chinese businesses had to leave behind billions in investments. Cui Shoujun, professor of international studies at Renmin University in Beijing, told the Chinese news and commentary site guancha.cn that the transition government in Caracas could deem agreements under Maduro unlawful and the debt to China illegal.\n\nAs in Libya, Beijing’s stakes in Venezuela have gone beyond oil. Chinese firms have invested in telecommunications, railways and ports in Venezuela, all now at risk, according to a report by the global financial firm Jefferies.\n\nStill, the firm noted that Beijing will likely manage any disruption because Venezuelan oil counted for only a small percentage of China's oil imports and because Beijing has diversified its energy supplies and pivoted to electrification.\n\nHours before he was captured by U.S. forces, Maduro hosted a high-level Chinese diplomat at the presidential palace and praised the countries' ties that had prospered from the days of his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, and given Beijing a strong foothold in America's backyard.\n\nVenezuela is the only Latin American country that has a high-level strategic partnership with China, on par with close friends like Pakistan, and the ouster of Maduro is expected to curtail China's influence in the Western Hemisphere — in line with one of the goals spelled out in the Trump administration's National Security Strategy.\n\nBeijing's response to the capture of Maduro\n\nSoon after Maduro was captured, Beijing said it was “deeply shocked” by the blatant use of U.S. force against a sovereign state and action against its president and said it “strongly” condemned the U.S. actions. It called for the immediate release of Maduro and his wife.\n\nChinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong said Thursday that no nation has the right to interfere with economic and trade cooperation between China and Venezuela, which he said is between two sovereign states and protected by international and domestic laws.\n\n“No matter how the political situation in Venezuela evolves, China’s willingness to deepen bilateral economic and trade cooperation will not change,” He said.\n\nSingleton said Beijing does not wield the clout in the Western Hemisphere as touted.\n\n“Beijing can protest diplomatically,” he said, “but it cannot protect partners or assets once Washington decides to apply direct pressure.”",

    "description": "USS Bulkeley and USS Paul Ignatius \"supported\" the operations to seize the vessel, a defense official told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "Two US Navy destroyers helped American forces chase down, board, and ultimately seize a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the North Atlantic after a weekslong chase across the ocean, a defense official told Business Insider on Thursday.\n\nThe Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers USS Bulkeley and USS Paul Ignatius \"supported\" the operations to seize the vessel, initially called Bella 1, on Wednesday, the official said.\n\nThe official declined to provide additional details about the warships' role in the seizure, citing operational security concerns.\n\nThe destroyers' involvement in the mission, which also included the Coast Guard and special operations forces, highlights the scale of the US military's efforts to capture the oil tanker, on the run since it evaded a naval blockade. Flight-tracking data showed various aircraft were airborne either shortly before or during the operation.\n\nThe UK government said it supported the operation with a tanker and Royal Air Force surveillance aircraft. A NATO official told Business Insider that the alliance's standing naval forces were not involved.\n\nBella 1, which has been described by the Trump administration as a \"dark fleet\" tanker operating in violation of sanctions, evaded a US naval blockade of sanctioned vessels near Venezuela last month and avoided attempts by the American military to board the vessel.\n\nThe tanker, sailing under the flag of Guyana, then fled north into the Atlantic, reflagged as a Russian vessel, and changed its name to the Marinera. On the run, the crew even painted the country's tricolor on the hull.\n\nThe Coast Guard pursued the tanker for weeks. The unusual chase ended on Wednesday when American forces seized the vessel in waters about halfway between the UK and Iceland.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told reporters that because the vessel had a judicial seizure order, the ship's crew is \"subject to prosecution for any applicable violation of federal law, and they will be brought to the United States for such prosecution if necessary.\"\n\nRussia's foreign ministry condemned the seizure and said that threats to prosecute the tanker's crew \"are entirely unacceptable,\" the state-owned news agency Tass reported on Thursday.\n\nSeparately, the US military said that it seized another sanctioned tanker — M/T Sophia — near the Caribbean Sea on Wednesday after it was \"conducting illicit activities\" in the region.\n\nThe back-to-back interdictions mark the latest in a string of vessel seizures that have occurred since the US announced last month that a naval blockade on sanctioned oil tankers trying to enter or leave Venezuela was going into effect.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the two tankers that were seized on Wednesday had either \"last docked\" in Venezuela or were sailing to the country.\n\n\"The United States continues to enforce the blockade against all dark fleet vessels illegally transporting Venezuelan oil to finance illicit activity, stealing from the Venezuelan people,\" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday after the operations. \"Only legitimate and lawful energy commerce — as determined by the US — will be permitted.\"\n\nThe US naval blockade was set up as part of a pressure campaign against Venezuela's former president, Nicolás Maduro, whom the US had long accused of facilitating drug trafficking and other criminal activity, allegations he denies.\n\nThe campaign also included a massive US military buildup in the Caribbean that began in August. American forces carried out dozens of airstrikes on alleged drug boats over the following months, as President Donald Trump threatened to take action against Venezuela.\n\nTensions between Trump and Maduro culminated over the weekend, when the US staged a dramatic surprise operation to capture Maduro. American forces who raided his compound in Caracas were supported by more than 150 military aircraft.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has threatened additional action against other countries near Venezuela, including Colombia, Cuba, and Mexico.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING (AP) — China escalated its trade tensions with Japan on Wednesday by launching an investigation into imported dichlorosilane, a chemical gas used in making semiconductors, a day after it imposed curbs on the export of so-called dual-use goods that could be used by Japan’s military.\n\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement that it had launched the investigation following an application from the domestic industry showing the price of dichlorosilane imported from Japan had decreased 31% between 2022 and 2024.\n\n“The dumping of imported products from Japan has damaged the production and operation of our domestic industry,” the ministry said.\n\nThe measure comes a day after Beijing banned exports to Japan of dual-use goods that can have military applications.\n\nBeijing has been showing mounting displeasure with Tokyo after new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested late last year that her nation's military could intervene if China were to take action against Taiwan — an island democracy that Beijing considers its own territory.\n\nTensions were stoked again on Tuesday when Japanese lawmaker Hei Seki, who last year was sanctioned by China for “spreading fallacies” about Taiwan and other disputed territories, visited Taiwan and called it an independent country. Also known as Yo Kitano, he has been banned from entering China. He told reporters that his arrival in Taiwan demonstrated the two are “different countries.”\n\n“I came to Taiwan … to prove this point, and to tell the world that Taiwan is an independent country,” Hei Seki said, according to Taiwan’s Central News Agency.\n\n“The nasty words of a petty villain like him are not worth commenting on,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning retorted when asked about his comment.\n\nMasaaki Kanai, head of Asia Oceanian Affairs at Japan's Foreign Ministry, urged China to scrap the trade curbs, saying a measure exclusively targeting Japan that deviates from international practice is unacceptable. Japan, however, has yet to announce any retaliatory measures.\n\nAs the two countries feuded, speculation rose that China might target rare earths exports to Japan, in a move similar to the rounds of critical minerals export restrictions it has imposed as part of its trade war with the United States.\n\nChina controls most of the global production of heavy rare earths, used for making powerful, heat-resistant magnets used in industries such as defense and electric vehicles.\n\nWhile the Commerce Ministry did not mention any new rare earths curbs, the official newspaper China Daily, seen as a government mouthpiece, quoted anonymous sources saying Beijing was considering tightening exports of certain rare earths to Japan. That report could not be independently confirmed.\n\nImproved South Korean ties contrast with Japan row\n\nAs Beijing spars with Tokyo, it has made a point of courting a different East Asian power — South Korea.\n\nOn Wednesday, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung wrapped up a four-day trip to China – his first since taking office in June. Lee and Chinese President Xi Jinping oversaw the signing of cooperation agreements in areas such as technology, trade, transportation and environmental protection.\n\nAs if to illustrate a contrast with the China-Japan trade frictions, Lee joined two business events at which major South Korean and Chinese companies pledged to collaborate.\n\nThe two sides signed 24 export contracts worth a combined $44 million, according to South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Resources.\n\nDuring Lee’s visit, Chinese media also reported that South Korea overtook Japan as the leading destination for outbound flights from China’s mainland over the New Year’s holiday.\n\nChina has been discouraging travel to Japan, saying Japanese leaders’ comments on Taiwan have created “significant risks to the personal safety and lives of Chinese citizens in Japan.”",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Chinese independent refiners are expected to switch to heavy crude from sources including Iran in coming months to replace Venezuelan shipments halted since the ​U.S. removed the country's president, traders and analysts said.\n\nCaracas and Washington agreed to export up to $2 ‌billion worth of Venezuelan crude to the United States, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday, after U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro over ‌the weekend.\n\nThat arrangement is likely to curtail Venezuelan supply to China, analysts say, reducing a source of cheap oil for independent refiners known as teapots. The world's biggest crude importer is a major buyer of discounted sanctioned oil from Russia, Iran and Venezuela.\n\n\"The Venezuela drama hits China's independent refineries the hardest, as they may lose access to the ⁠discounted heavy barrels,\" said Sparta Commodities analyst ‌June Goh.\n\n\"However as there are ample Russian and Iranian feedstocks available and Venezuelan barrels on water, we do not foresee the teapots needing to bid up for unsanctioned barrels as ‍the economics would likely not make sense for them,\" she said.\n\nChina imported 389,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan oil in 2025, about 4% of its total seaborne crude imports, Kpler data showed.\n\nAt least a dozen sanctioned vessels that loaded in December departed Venezuelan ​waters in early January carrying some 12 million barrels of crude and fuel, Reuters has reported. However, loadings ‌for Asia at Venezuela's main ports have stopped since January 1, shipping data showed.\n\nWith supply tightening, sellers of Venezuelan Merey crude for prompt delivery offered cargoes at discounts of about $10 per barrel to ICE Brent versus $15 last month, said one trader, although trade has come to a standstill.\n\nAnother trader said offers were at minus $11 per barrel.\n\nFLOATING STORAGE CAN LAST 75 DAYS\n\nVenezuelan crude aboard ships in Asia remains sufficient to cover roughly 75 days of Chinese demand, limiting any ⁠immediate upside for alternatives, said Kpler senior analyst Xu Muyu.\n\nTeapots using ​Venezuelan oil are likely to switch to Russian and Iranian supply ​in March and April, and China can also tap non-sanctioned sources such as Canada, Brazil, Iraq, and Colombia, she said.\n\nBuyers have yet to start sourcing alternatives, trade sources said, with Iranian Heavy ‍crude priced at a discount ⁠of about $10 per barrel to ICE Brent in ample supply, the cheapest alternative.",

    "description": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns about 6% of Chevron, the only US oil major currently operating in Venezuela.",
    "fullText": "Investors are scrambling to identify potential winners from the US capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and President Donald Trump's plan to \"run\" the nation and deliver an oil boom. Berkshire Hathaway is one contender thanks to its large bet on Chevron.\n\n\"Berkshire should benefit from its 6% stake in Chevron, since it is the only US oil major in Venezuela,\" David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland who's closely followed Berkshire for more than four decades, told Business Insider.\n\nBerkshire — now led by Greg Abel following Warren Buffett's recent retirement as CEO — is Chevron's largest corporate shareholder with a 6% stake worth about $19 billion, assuming Berkshire hasn't altered the wager since its latest portfolio update.\n\nThe conglomerate counted the oil major as its fifth-largest stock position at the end of September 2025, representing about 7% of the total $267 billion value of its US stock portfolio.\n\nVenezuela has the world's largest proven crude oil reserves, but decades of underinvestment in its oil infrastructure mean it only produces about 1% of global oil output.\n\nChevron has secured short-term exemptions to US sanctions on Venezuela, allowing it to produce and export limited amounts of the country's oil.\n\nRivals, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, left Venezuela years ago following the nationalization of the country's oil industry and government seizures of foreign-owned assets.\n\nTrump said over the weekend that he envisions large US oil companies coming to Venezuela, fixing and modernizing its pipelines and refineries, and supercharging the country's oil production.\n\nExcited investors piled into oil stocks on Monday. Chevron shares surged as much as 6.3% on the day to a nine-month high of about $166, briefly valuing Berkshire's stake at over $20 billion. They retreated on Tuesday but are still up nearly 3% so far in 2026.\n\nChevron already has stakes in five production projects in Venezuela, thanks to partnerships with affiliates of the country's state oil company.\n\nOn an earnings call in August, CEO Mike Wirth highlighted Chevron's deep foothold in the country. He said it has been operating in Venezuela for more than a century, and has \"played an important role in regional energy security, as well as maintaining American economic interests.\"\n\nChevron's presence in Venezuela means it \"stands to benefit from any reopening,\" Maurizio Carulli, a global energy analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said in a Tuesday note.\n\nThe oil major has the personnel, licenses, and oil fields \"ready to ramp up immediately,\" Charles-Henry Monchau, CIO of Syz Group, also said in a note on Tuesday.\n\nIndustry analysts have warned it will take years and huge sums to revitalize Venezuela's oil sector, and US companies won't want to invest heavily until they're confident they won't have assets seized or contracts changed down the line.\n\nThat suggests Venezuela won't be an overnight game changer for Chevron or Berkshire.\n\nBerkshire has further exposure to the oil industry via Occidental Petroleum, its next-largest stock holding after Chevron. It owns more than a quarter of the energy explorer and producer — a stake worth $11 billion today.\n\nA Chevron spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement: \"Chevron remains focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets. We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\"",

    "description": "Once one of the world's richest nations, Venezuela has faced a decadeslong collapse that triggered one of the largest migrations in history.",
    "fullText": "Half a century ago, Venezuela was one of the world's richest nations. Today, decades of economic collapse have driven nearly a quarter of its population to flee the country.\n\nOn January 3, the US launched a military operation in Venezuela that resulted in the capture of President Nicolás Maduro. He pleaded not guilty to narco-terrorism and weapons-related charges in New York on Monday.\n\nThe seizure of the country's leader, which Venezuelan officials have called a \"kidnapping,\" has raised questions about sovereignty and legality, as well as Venezuela's political and economic future.\n\nThe country, which has the largest proven oil reserves in the world, estimated at about a fifth of the world's total, produces less than 1% of the global oil production today, due to what President Donald Trump has called \"badly broken infrastructure.\"\n\nUS officials have said they will seek to influence Venezuela's transitional government and attract investment from American energy companies to help revive its collapsed oil sector.\n\nDuring the 1950s and more dramatically in the 1970s, Venezuela experienced periods of vast oil-fueled economic growth — nicknamed by historians as \"Saudi Venezuela\" — where luxury, foreign travel, and modernization defined a growing middle class.\n\nAt the same time, the dramatic wealth of the era left some behind, highlighting the visible inequalities that contributed to a shift in domestic politics by the end of the century.\n\nThese vintage photos capture what life in Venezuela was like during its decades of oil-fueled economic prosperity and how the country evolved as its economy boomed.\n\nThe first oil discovery in Venezuela was made near Lake Maracaibo in 1914. The national oil industry experienced exponential growth throughout the 1920s and 1930s, as foreign investments began to pour into the country.\n\nThe oil industry's boom transformed the country's economy, which had previously primarily been a coffee exporter.\n\nThe growing oil industry concentrated jobs and investment in the country's capital, drawing migrants from rural areas and smaller cities in search of work and opportunity.\n\n\"There was a growing, expansive, and increasingly influential middle class that established itself in the oil industry,\" said Miguel Tinker Salas, a Pomona College history professor focusing on Venezuelan oil culture and society.\n\nBefore the discovery and expansion of the oil industry in the country, Venezuela was a poor and rural nation, and its economy was defined by agricultural exports, such as coffee and cacao, as reported by Mongabay. Wealth in Venezuela was predominantly held by large landowners, who formed a dominant elite.\n\nThe rapid growth of the oil industry provided the country's middle class, which was relatively small and concentrated in cities like Caracas, with an opportunity for professional expansion.\n\n\"They benefited tremendously from oil wealth and held managerial and professional positions,\" Tinker Salas told Business Insider. \"But they remained a small percentage of the population.\"\n\nHe estimates that less than 20% of the population was part of the middle class that emerged from oil growth.\n\n\"The hardware of modernity — the buildings, the architecture, the glitzy lights, and the planned development of cities — was made possible by oil,\" said Alejandro Velasco, an associate professor of Latin American history at New York University.\n\nAs oil wealth flowed into the country, urban consumer culture in Caracas and other major cities was heavily influenced by the United States. Among members of the middle and upper classes, shopping, fashion, and leisure increasingly reflected American tastes and lifestyles.\n\n\"For a particular segment of the population, they wanted to see themselves as an appendage of Miami-Dade County,\" Tinker Salas said. \"For another segment of the population, that dream was never possible.\"\n\n\"Those who had money,\" Tinker Salas said, \"could get on a plane in Caracas on a Friday afternoon, be in Miami in three hours, shop at Miami department stores, and come back on Sunday afternoon.\"\n\nCaracas also became an international hub for fashion and culture, attracting designers, models, and luxury brands from around the world.\n\nFrom 1976 to 1982, Air France operated a weekly Concorde flight between Caracas and Paris, a symbol of how closely Venezuela's elites aligned themselves with Europe during the oil boom.\n\nEconomic prosperity made luxury brands and high-end shopping popular in parts of Caracas, particularly for the country's wealthiest residents. But that consumer culture existed alongside stark economic inequality.\n\n\"You had fancy department stores and consumer culture existing side by side with deep inequality,\" Tinker Salas said.\n\nWhile the capital city remained the center of political and economic power, oil revenues also fueled development in other cities, shaping urban life across much of the country and giving more people access to \"electricity, medical services, and infrastructure that was often lacking in rural areas,\" Tinker Salas said.\n\nThroughout the century, as the agricultural industry lost its dominance of the domestic economy, the country saw increased internal migration to urban centers.\n\nThe city surrounding Lake Maracaibo, where oil was first discovered in the country, grew into Venezuela's second-largest city as oil production expanded.\n\nIts economy, identity, and growth were closely tied to oil, making the city a counterpart to Caracas during Venezuela's decades of rapid expansion.\n\nAs international companies grew their operations, Maracaibo welcomed many foreign oil workers.\n\nAs the oil industry expanded, Venezuela attracted foreign oil workers and immigrants, including Europeans during and after World War II. These arrivals helped shape the culture of the country's major cities.\n\n\"Oil exploration brought cultural influence, but Venezuela also became a destination for immigrants from Europe and across Latin America,\" Velasco said.\n\nNot every part of Venezuela was reshaped evenly during the expansion of the oil industry. As cities expanded, many rural areas continued to rely on agriculture, fishing, and local trade throughout the mid-century.\n\n\"On the surface, the country had a veneer of progress,\" Tinker Salas said. \"Venezuela had the highest standard of living in Latin America, but it also had the highest cost of living.\"\n\nWhile modern high-rises emerged in Caracas and other major cities, slums and informal settlements — or barrios — surrounding urban centers often told a different story from the luxurious, store-lined streets.\n\n\"The city was expanding and growing dramatically,\" Tinker Salas said, \"but alongside and in the shadow of those high-rise buildings were poor shacks where people lived in poverty.\"\n\nIn many neighborhoods, access to reliable water, sanitation, and other basic services remained limited even as other parts of the city modernized. Rapid urban growth during the oil era often outpaced infrastructure and long-term planning, leaving families to manage everyday shortages on their own.\n\nThe growth of informal neighborhoods surrounding major cities was a marker of internal migration patterns, where families from rural areas came to the city.\n\n\"Before the 1950s, barrios served as a kind of transitional space — people were in the city, but not fully of the city,\" Velasco said. \"There was a sense of gradual upward mobility: moving from the countryside into a barrio, then into a rented room, then eventually into a house or apartment.\"\n\n\"Even at the height of the so-called golden era, there was tremendous social, cultural, and economic disparity,\" Tinker Salas said.\n\nBetween the late 1940s and the 1950s, the dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez ruled Venezuela after rising to power during a period of political instability.\n\nHis military government utilized growing oil revenues to fund major infrastructure and modernization projects, even as political and civil freedoms were tightly restricted, reflecting a long-standing pattern of strongman rule that has shaped Venezuelan politics during the country's push toward democracy.\n\nUnder Pérez Jiménez, large public housing projects — or superblocks — were constructed in an effort to modernize the capital and reshape its working-class population. During this effort, informal settlements and barrios were razed, and their residents were forcibly relocated into high-rise complexes designed to reshape their way of life.\n\n\"People were suddenly expected to become modern residents in new spaces, and that transition was difficult,\" Velasco said.\n\nDaily life in the complexes was regulated by strict rules of conduct and state oversight. The model relied on the control of an authoritarian state, Velasco said, which ended as Venezuela moved toward democracy.\n\n\"The failure of that project produced a paradox where you have superblocks and barrios right next to each other,\" Velasco said.\n\nLinking the capital to the mountaintop Hotel Humbold, the Caracas Aerial Tramway symbolized how the state used large-scale public works to project progress, visibility, and national pride in an era that emphasized monumental infrastructure as proof of modernization.\n\nOpened in 1953 as part of a government effort to increase tourism, the Hotel Tamanaco was a key component of a broader initiative to present Venezuela as a modern, international destination.\n\nThe military dictatorship ended in early 1958, but the transition to democracy was marked by unrest, strikes, and internal divisions within the armed forces. In the months that followed, a new civilian-led government struggled to stabilize the country and respond to popular demands amid lingering uncertainty.\n\n\"The 1960s, when democracy began in Venezuela, are not a period of abundance,\" Velasco said. \"They're a period of crisis.\"\n\nDuring the early days of its democracy, Venezuela was widely perceived abroad — and promoted at home — as a stable democracy at a time when military rule was common in Latin America.\n\nHigh-profile diplomatic engagements, like the visit of US President John F. Kennedy, promoted the myth of Venezuela as an \"exceptional democracy,\" as Tinker Salas described it, even during a time when democratic regimes struggled internally.\n\n\"The myth of Venezuela as the exceptional democracy persisted because Venezuela provided the contrary example to what was happening in Cuba,\" Tinker Salas said.\n\nConstruction of the Guri Dam began in the early 1960s and continued in phases through the 1980s, reflecting a long-term effort to channel oil revenues into large-scale development projects.\n\nThe hydroelectric complex was part of a broader effort to diversify Venezuela's economy and modernize the country through investments in industry, energy, and infrastructure, extending beyond oil itself.\n\nIntroduced through US oil companies and foreign workers, baseball spread first through oil camps and industrial towns before taking root across the country.\n\nOver time, the sport moved beyond its foreign origins and became a shared cultural language, eventually emerging as one of Venezuela's most powerful symbols of national identity.\n\nAs television spread across Venezuela, variety shows and music programs introduced salsa, Caribbean rhythms, and popular performers into living rooms nationwide.\n\nLaunched in the early 1950s, the Miss Venezuela pageant grew alongside the spread of television and mass media, turning beauty competitions into nationally shared events.\n\nOver time, the pageant evolved into a symbol of national pride, representing how Venezuelans presented themselves to one another and to the world.\n\nDecades of rapid growth reshaped daily life in Venezuela, affecting everyone from rural migrants who moved into expanding cities to foreign immigrants who arrived as the country experienced unprecedented prosperity.\n\nFor those who remained in Venezuela — and for the millions who have since left — the past paints a complex picture of ambition, luxury, and inequality.",

When you earn dividends, you automatically reinvest those proceeds to buy more shares, and your returns grow over time.\n\nBut there’s a catch, says personal finance YouTuber Mark Tilbury: the magic only really happens after you’ve invested your first $100,000.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers.

About 56% of Americans believe the cost of living is too high, according to a survey conducted by Politico last month (1).\n\nWhile it might take you longer to reach this milestone than it did previous generations, it’s still worth pursuing.\n\nHere’s why the first $100,000 is so important and how to reach it quickly.\n\nAfter you hit $100,000, “compound interest stops being lame,” according to Tilbury. “Getting that chunk of money as fast as possible is the key. [...] Once you get to this point, it’s almost inevitable that you’ll be wealthy if you just invest in a low-cost index fund.”\n\nTo get there, Tilbury suggests people follow what he calls the GROWTH method:\n\nG: Gain control of your finances.\n\nO: Optimize your tax management.\n\nT: Tap into additional income streams.\n\nGaining control of your finances is crucial for achieving long-term financial stability and reaching your goals. And according to Tilbury, there’s only one way to gain control of your finances — budgeting. Once you’ve assessed your budget, there may even be ways you can shave off some unnecessary dollars and avoid unnecessary spending.",

    "fullText": "Deal indicates Venezuelan government is responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention\n\nDonald Trump has said Venezuela will be “turning over” $2bn worth of Venezuelan crude to the United States, a flagship negotiation that would divert supplies from China while helping Venezuela avoid deeper oil production cuts.\n\n“This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!” Trump said in a post online.\n\nVenezuelan government officials and state company PDVSA did not provide comment.\n\nVenezuela has millions of barrels of oil loaded on tankers and in storage tanks that it has been unable to ship due to the blockade imposed by Trump, as part of the pressure campaign that culminated in the toppling of Nicolás Maduro who was seized from his country by US forces over the weekend.\n\nTop Venezuelan officials have called Maduro’s capture a kidnapping and accused the US of trying to steal the country’s vast oil reserver, however Tuesday’s agreement is a strong sign that the government is responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention.\n\nTrump has said he wants interim president Delcy Rodríguez to give the US and private companies “total access” to Venezuela’s oil industry.\n\nUS energy secretary Chris Wright is in charge of executing the deal, Trump said, adding that the oil will be taken from ships and sent directly to US ports. Supplying the trapped crude to the US could initially require reallocating cargoes originally bound for China, two sources had told Reuters earlier on Tuesday.\n\nChina has been Venezuela’s top buyer in the last decade and especially since the United States imposed sanctions on companies involved in oil trade with Venezuela in 2020.\n\nUS crude prices fell more than 1.5% after Trump’s announcement, with the agreement expected to increase the volume of Venezuelan oil exported to the US. That flow of oil is currently controlled entirely by Chevron, PDVSA’s main joint venture partner, under a US authorisation.\n\nChevron, which has been exporting between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan oil to the US, is the only company that has been loading and shipping crude without interruption from the South American country in recent weeks under the blockade.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Venezuela would have any access to proceeds from the supply. Sanctions mean PDVSA is excluded from the global financial system, its bank accounts are frozen and it is blocked from executing transactions in US dollars\n\nHours before Trump’s announcement on Tuesday, Rodríguez hardened her tone against the US, saying in a televised address that “no external agent governs Venezuela” – a clear rebuttal to the US president’s claim that, after the capture of Maduro, the US would now run the South American country.\n\nIt marked another shift in tone from Maduro’s former vice-president. After being sworn in as president by Venezuela’s supreme court on Saturday, Rodríguez released a conciliatory statement late on Sunday in which she “invited the US government to work together on an agenda of cooperation”.\n\nIn Tuesday’s address, however, Rodríguez reverted to harsher language, describing Saturday’s strike – the first large-scale US military operation on South American soil – as a “terrible military aggression” and a “criminal attack” whose “absolutely illegal outcome, in violation of international law”, was the “kidnapping” of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.\n\n“We are a people who do not surrender, who do not give up, and we are here, governing together with the people. The government of Venezuela rules in our country – no one else. There is no external agent governing Venezuela. It is Venezuela, its constitutional government, and the consolidated power of the people,” said Rodríguez, who had served as Maduro’s vice-president since 2018.",

    "fullText": "Not all American energy companies stand to benefit from a potential revival of Venezuela's oil industry following the US's capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.\n\nEnergy stocks rose on Monday as investors priced in potential gains from renewed US access to Venezuela's massive oil reserves. But analysts say smaller companies could struggle to benefit from a recovery in the country's energy sector.\n\nAdditional Venezuelan oil supply over the coming years could be \"negative for shale producers\" that don't have a footprint in Venezuela, Daan Struyven, the head of oil research at Goldman Sachs, said on the firm's \"Exchanges\" podcast, published on Tuesday.\n\nThat's because prices and volumes could come under pressure if supply growth over the next five to 10 years comes from Venezuela rather than from US shale, he added.\n\nThe potential strain on shale reflects a key difference in oil quality. Venezuelan crude is heavy and sulfur-rich, while US shale production is dominated by lighter oil. Many US Gulf Coast refineries were originally designed to process heavier crude, making Venezuelan barrels a better fit.\n\nGreater access to Venezuelan crude could therefore benefit refiners while undermining demand for lighter shale barrels.\n\nWhile light shale oil and heavy crude like Venezuela's are not directly interchangeable, increased supplies of heavy oil can still reshape refinery demand and pricing across the broader market. That kind of change would indirectly pressure US shale producers, who have long been the engine of America's shale revolution.\n\n\"In the US, the first casualties would likely be some oil producers, particularly smaller shale firms with high debt and thin margins,\" Philippe Le Billon, a professor at the University of British Columbia who studies the political economy of natural resources, wrote in The Conversation on Sunday.\n\nFurthermore, oil prices have already been under pressure in recent years due to ample supply and sluggish demand growth.\n\nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude futures are trading around $56 a barrel, while Brent futures are around $60 a barrel. Both are down around 2% so far this year after falling 20% last year.\n\nEven an increase in Venezuela's oil production in the medium term could put downward pressure on oil prices, making it harder for higher-cost US shale producers to justify new drilling, researchers at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy said in a Sunday post.\n\nThat dynamic could intensify the pressure on US shale producers.\n\n\"This complicates the notion that the US would unambiguously 'win' from a Venezuelan oil revival. Energy geopolitics creates winners and losers on all sides,\" wrote Le Billon.",

Interim President Delcy Rodriguez is now running the government, which the U.S. ‌has said it will oversee.\n\nThe United States imposed a blockade on sanctioned oil tankers sailing into and out of Venezuelan waters last month, which halted most exports other than those destined for Chevron.\n\nChevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in the country under a U.S. license that exempts it from sanctions imposed by Washington on Venezuela's oil industry ⁠to choke off revenue that financed Maduro's ‌government.\n\nOn Tuesday, several vessels chartered by Chevron were the only ones loading crude for export at Venezuela's Jose and Bajo Grande ports, ship monitoring data showed.\n\nOther ships were loading ‍either to move oil between domestic ports or to store crude because onshore storage was almost completely full, according to PDVSA's internal documents.\n\nThe last crude cargo that was loaded for an Asian customer at Jose finished loading on January 1, according to ​the data and documents. Without more exports, PDVSA could be forced to deepen production cuts it began in ‌recent days because storage tanks are full.\n\nChevron on Monday resumed exports of Venezuelan oil to the U.S. after a four-day pause and called workers abroad back to its Venezuelan offices as flights to the country restarted. The U.S. firm has emerged in recent weeks as the only company fluidly exporting Venezuela's crude.\n\nAt least a dozen vessels under sanctions that had loaded in December and had been stuck in Venezuela's waters due to the embargo sailed in ⁠early January.\n\nThose vessels were carrying around 12 million barrels of ​crude and fuel. It was unclear where the vessels were heading, ​although they were initially loaded for customers in China. The ships left in \"dark mode,\" which means that transponders that send out their location were switched off. The vessels appeared to break ‍the U.S. tanker blockade.\n\nThe U.S. ⁠government has not commented on the vessels or whether it authorized the departures. PDVSA has not replied to a request for comment. Chevron said this week it continues to operate \"in full compliance with all relevant ⁠laws and regulations.\"",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces used long-range, deep-strike drones to hit a Russian missile arsenal and oil depot supporting the invasion, a security official told Business Insider on Tuesday.\n\nThe attacks mark Ukraine's latest deep strikes as it continues to target Russian weapons and the country's vast energy sector, a major revenue source for the state as it wages war.\n\nA source in the Security Service of Ukraine, the SBU, said that drones hit Russia's 100th Main Missile and Artillery Directorate (GRAU) in the western Kostroma region. They were only authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss military developments.\n\nThe drone attack on the facility triggered a secondary detonation of ammunition, causing powerful blasts at the facility, the source said, calling it an important target because Russia uses it to supply munitions to smaller sites in other areas of the country.\n\nThe source said drones also struck an oil depot in the nearby Lipetsk region, sparking an \"intense\" blaze. Video footage and images shared on social media appeared to show fire and smoke at the two facilities.\n\nOvernight, Ukrainian attack drones successfully hit a Russian oil depot in the town of Usman, Lipetsk Oblast. Seen here, flames leap into the night sky from the burning facility. pic.twitter.com/EN6SRI2sXU\n\nRussia's defense ministry said on Tuesday that it shot down 360 Ukrainian drones without specifying where. Neither the ministry nor the Russian embassy in the US responded to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nThe SBU source said that the two drone attacks were carried out by its Alpha group, an elite \"spetsnaz\" unit considered to be among the best of Ukraine's special forces.\n\nThe Alpha group regularly carries out long-range drone attacks against Russian targets, including a recent first-of-its-kind strike on a Moscow-linked oil tanker in the Mediterranean Sea and the stunning June attacks against Russian airbases, known as Operation Spiderweb.\n\nThe SBU's Alpha forces also carry out ground operations; for instance, they have participated in Ukraine's defense of Pokrovsk, the war-torn city in the eastern Donetsk region that has been the site of some of the conflict's most intense fighting.\n\n\"In the New Year, the SBU continues to work successfully on military and oil facilities of the Russian Federation, reducing the enemy's ability to provide their army with ammunition and fuel,\" the source said in translated remarks shared with Business Insider.\n\n\"All Russian rear facilities that work for the war against Ukraine are absolutely legitimate targets,\" they added.\n\nSince August, Ukraine has stepped up its use of long-range drones to attack Russian energy facilities in a bid to put pressure on a key source of revenue for Moscow that helps fuel its war efforts.\n\nUkraine has mostly targeted oil and gas infrastructure on land, such as depots and ports, but in recent weeks, it has expanded attacks to maritime targets, striking several oil tankers and oil platforms in the Black, Caspian, and Mediterranean seas.\n\nUkrainian officials have described the deep-strike operations as the country's way of imposing \"long-range\" sanctions on Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, Tuesday's attack on the 100th GRAU arsenal reflects a tactic that Ukraine has long relied on — hitting ammunition storage sites inside Russia to cause more near-term battlefield impacts.",

    "fullText": "President says a ‘tremendous amount of money’ will need to be spent repairing country’s infrastructure\n\nWhy Venezuelan crude appeals to US refineries\n\nVenezuela live – latest updates\n\nDonald Trump has suggested US taxpayers could reimburse energy companies for repairing Venezuelan infrastructure for extracting and shipping oil.\n\nTrump acknowledged that “a lot of money” would need to be spent to increase oil production in Venezuela after US forces ousted its leader, Nicolás Maduro, but suggested his government could pay oil companies to do the work.\n\n“A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent and the oil companies will spend it, and then they’ll get reimbursed by us or through revenue,” the president said.\n\nThe US energy secretary, Chris Wright, reportedly plans to meet representatives of Chevron, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil at the Goldman Sachs Energy, Clean Tech & Utilities Conference in Miami later this week.\n\nRepresentatives of Trump’s administration are planning to meet executives to discuss increasing Venezuelan production, Reuters reported.\n\nThe meetings are crucial to the Trump administration’s hopes of getting top oil companies back into the South American nation after its government, nearly two decades ago, took control of US-led energy operations there.\n\nThe three biggest US oil companies – Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron – have not yet had any conversations with the administration about Maduro’s removal, Reuters reported. This contradicted Trump’s statements over the weekend that he had already held meetings with “all” the US oil companies, before and since Maduro was seized.\n\n“Nobody in those three companies has had conversations with the White House about operating in Venezuela, pre-removal or post-removal to this point,” one of the sources told Reuters.\n\nThe upcoming meetings will be crucial to the administration’s hopes to increase production and exports of heavy, unctuous crude from Venezuela, a former Opec nation that sits atop the world’s largest reserves and whose barrels can be processed by specially designed US refineries.\n\nAchieving that goal will require years of work and billions of dollars of investment, analysts say.\n\nVenezuela produces on average about 1.1m barrels of oil a day, down from the 3.5m barrels produced in 1999 before a government takeover of the domestic industry.\n\nIt is unclear which executives will be attending the upcoming meetings, and whether oil companies will be attending individually or collectively.\n\nThe White House did not comment on the meetings but said it believed the US oil industry was ready to move in to Venezuela.\n\n“All of our oil companies are ready and willing to make big investments in Venezuela that will rebuild their oil infrastructure, which was destroyed by the illegitimate Maduro regime,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.\n\nExxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips did not immediately respond to requests for comment to Reuters.\n\nAsked if the administration had briefed any oil companies before the military operation, Trump said, “No. But we’ve been talking to the concept of, ‘what if we did it?’”\n\n“The oil companies were absolutely aware that we were thinking about doing something,” Trump told NBC News. “But we didn’t tell them we were going to do it.”\n\nHe told NBC News it was “too soon” to say whether he had personally spoken to top executives at the three companies. “I speak to everybody,” he said.\n\nTrump said hours after Maduro’s capture he expects the biggest US oil companies to spend billions of dollars increase Venezuela’s oil production, after it dropped to about a third of its peak over the past two decades because of underinvestment and sanctions.\n\nBut those plans will be hindered by lack of infrastructure, along with deep uncertainty over the country’s political future, legal framework and long-term US policy, according to industry analysts.\n\nChevron is the only US major operating in Venezuela’s oilfields. Exxon and ConocoPhillips operated in the country before their projects were nationalised by former president Hugo Chávez.\n\nThe S&P 500 energy index rose to its highest since March 2025 on Monday, as Exxon Mobil rose 2.2% and Chevron jumped 5.1%.",

    "description": "If the US operation in Venezuela tells us anything, it’s that Washington is thinking past the shale boom and back to a more traditional playbook.",
    "fullText": "If the US operation in Venezuela tells us anything, it’s that Washington is thinking past the shale boom and back to a more traditional playbook: secure access to oil abroad when supply at home looks less assured.\n\nStart with the numbers. The US Energy Information Administration expects US crude output to dip slightly in 2026, after several years of growth. That’s not a collapse. But it matters politically because shale is a treadmill: production stability depends on constant reinvestment, which in turn depends on price. Top-tier shale sites can work at lower prices, but meaningfully higher prices are required to profitably drill new wells.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Venezuela looks like a long-term option the US doesn’t want to leave to rivals. Recent reporting around the crisis frames the push as one where US oil firms are being invited back into a country with the world’s largest stated reserves, but a degraded industry, an opportunity some analysts describe as a “poisoned chalice,” with extra-heavy Venezuelan supply requiring high prices and heavy upfront investment to scale.\n\nThat brings us to the uncomfortable inference: This is oil security dressed up as strategy. And it hints at a return to a familiar American pattern — political interference in petrostates — that felt less central in the 2014-2024 period when shale growth and surging exports reduced the urgency of “barrels at any cost.”\n\nOil has often been the subtext of US foreign policy. The 1953 coup in Iran followed the nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The point is not that “one company did it,” but that energy interests and state power intertwine when strategic supply appears at stake.\n\nToday, the corporate “face” of the Venezuela file is Chevron, not because it “controls” US policy, but because it sits at the chokepoint. With sanctions and licensing, Chevron has effectively become a valve, a channel through which some Venezuelan crude can still reach the US.\n\nThere’s also a quieter, very practical reason Venezuela matters: refinery physics. US shale is mostly light sweet. Venezuela’s flagship exports are often heavy sour. These are not interchangeable. What Venezuela can do, quickly, is redirect heavy barrels back to US Gulf Coast refineries that are built to run them — exactly the kind of trade shift that also happens to reduce China’s access to discounted sanctioned crude. For Washington, that China angle is a bonus argument, not the core driver.\n\nBut let’s be clear-eyed about the limits. Venezuela’s oil is hard to produce. Even optimistic investment roadmaps talk in multiyear timelines. So anyone expecting a fast flood of supply is likely to be disappointed. Even the reserve story is not simple. Venezuela may top the charts on paper, but “proved reserves” are an economic classification as much as a geological one.\n\nThat’s the deeper point for markets: Supply growth is not just about claimed resources. It’s about prices, production technology, political stability, know-how, and logistics.\n\nIf all of this is telling us anything, it’s that higher oil prices in the future may be needed to offset decline dynamics in both shale and extra-heavy oil provinces like Venezuela. Washington may be trying to secure additional future supply to cap price spikes, but that won’t be easy, and it won’t be quick.\n\nOPEC in a Shale Oil World: Where to Next?\n\nThe “Donroe Doctrine” gives Washington control of nearly 40% of the world oil output, and with it the power to keep crude prices close to $50 a barrel, writes Bloomberg Opinion’s Javier Blas.",

    "description": "Peter Krull, director of Earth Equity Advisors, discusses why he's bullish on renewable energy and shares his top clean energy stock picks.",
    "fullText": "Clean energy faced headwinds in 2025 as the White House prioritized fossil fuels, but the market showed remarkable resilience, which one investor thinks is set to boost renewable stocks further in 2026.\n\nAfter being buffeted by uncertainty related to energy policy changes in Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill, solar and other clean power stocks did remarkably well in 2025. The S&P Global Clean Energy Transition index is up 46% in the last year, compared to 16% for the broader S&P 500.\n\nPeter Krull, the former CEO and now director of Earth Equity Advisors, a sustainable investment firm and advisory with more than $150 million in assets, thinks that streak of outperformance could continue. With 2026 underway, he predicts certain clean energy stocks are poised to continue rising, even as uncertainty lingers.\n\nIn his view, the clean energy transformation that has been taking place for years will continue. He sees it starting to reshape markets such as infrastructure and transportation in 2026, ushering in a new wave of growth for the companies helping lay the foundation for a new phase of industrial development.\n\n\"I continue to be bullish on renewable energy both for the long and short-term,\" Krull told Business Insider. \"Climate change is pushing all economies to adopt cleaner energy, transportation, and real estate systems.\"\n\nHere are his top clean energy stocks to buy this year.\n\nCommentary: This electrical infrastructure company may not be well known outside its industry, but Krull sees it as a strategic play on an extremely important industry. MYR Group is coming off a strong year, and he thinks it will continue making progress in 2026 as demand increases due to the ongoing AI boom.\n\n\"Between the clean energy transition and the AI buildout, we're going to need to move electrons efficiently across the country,\" he said. \"MYR designs and builds transmission lines to meet the ever-growing demand for more electricity. I see continued growth for at least the next decade in their services.\"\n\nCommentary: While not a direct clean energy play, Recursion Pharmaceuticals is known for prioritizing sustainability in its operations. Krull remains highly bullish on the stock, citing the potential for AI to help transform the world of biotechnology and pharmaceutical development.\n\n\"Recursion teamed up with Nvidia to build a supercomputer to analyze potential drug opportunities. The analysis performed by the Recursion system has the potential to speed up the drug development process and reduce the cost of development by half.\n\nKrull said that while he views Recursion as a riskier play than the other clean energy stocks on his list, he still sees high upside potential.\n\nCommentary: First Solar is a leader in the solar technology space, a key component of the clean energy sector. The stock performed well in 2025, and Krull maintains that its growth is still in its early stages as the company prepares to continue expanding its empire in 2026.\n\n\"They are focused on innovation in the solar manufacturing space, investing in clean manufacturing and higher cell efficiency,\" Krull noted. \"The company has a year-long backlog and is sold out through 2026.\"\n\nCommentary: Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure invests in sustainable infrastructure companies, specifically those in the renewable energy space, such as solar and wind power firms. Krull sees this as a lucrative niche that will pay off as clean energy demand rises.\n\n\"There will be more opportunities to build out our renewable energy systems, and companies like Hannon Armstrong will be vital for financing,\" he predicted.\n\nCommentary: This electric vehicle producer rebounded in 2025 after shaking off significant volatility. Krull thinks that Rivian is poised to emerge stronger than ever in 2026, even as the EV market faces uncertainty.\n\nKrull thinks the automaker is well-positioned to serve a section of the market that industry leader Tesla hasn't focused on.\n\n\"Their anticipated R3 models will be in the lower-end EV market, a market Tesla doesn't seem to be targeting,\" he said of Rivian. \"Their CEO, R.J. Scaringe, is brilliant; he understands the importance of connected and integrated systems in EVs.\"",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said the US could reimburse American oil companies for expanding their operations in Venezuela.\n\n\"A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent, and the oil companies will spend it, and then they'll get reimbursed by us or through revenue,\" Trump told NBC News in an interview on Monday.\n\nTrump declined to share his estimate of the cost for companies to repair or expand the South American country's deteriorating oil infrastructure.\n\nDespite Venezuela's vast oil reserves — estimated at about one-fifth of the world's total — the country's output accounts for less than 1% of global daily oil production, because of sanctions, corruption, and what Trump has called \"badly broken infrastructure.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Trump said that the removal of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro from power would open up these vast reserves. Experts have said that the move could reshape the global energy market, disadvantaging China and Russia.\n\n\"They were pumping almost nothing by comparison to what they could have been,\" Trump said in a public address.\n\nTrump's comments followed an early Saturday raid in which US armed forces and law enforcement struck parts of the capital, Caracas, and captured Maduro and his wife.\n\nIn Monday's NBC interview, Trump said, \"Having a Venezuela that's an oil producer is good for the United States because it keeps the price of oil down.\"\n\nLower oil prices could mean cheaper gas for average Americans, but may also disincentivize the \"very large United States oil companies\" that Trump said he may subsidize.\n\nTrump added it was \"too soon\" to say whether he had spoken to executives at Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips, America's three largest oil producers.\n\nThe oil market has been under pressure, with crude prices falling 20% last year. A main issue facing the market is an oversupply of global crude because of sluggish demand. It's a focus of OPEC+, which over the weekend said it will refrain from pumping new oil during the first quarter.",
