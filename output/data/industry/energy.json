The search has concluded, and an investigation is underway.\n\nAction News has also learned that 20 people were sent to various hospitals. Their conditions are unknown.\n\nIt happened around 2:15 p.m. at the Bristol Health and Rehab Center, also known as Silver Lake Nursing Home, on the 900 block of Tower Road in Bristol Township.\n\nPECO confirms crews responded around 2 p.m. after getting reports of a gas odor.\n\nThe explosion occurred while crews were on the scene. PECO said it's not known at this time if their equipment, or natural gas, was involved in the incident.\n\nVideo from the Action Cam showed flames erupting from the building. Debris could be seen scattered around the area.\n\nAn explosion and fire have been reported at a nursing home in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.\n\nThis facility is operated by the Saber Healthcare Group, based in Ohio.\n\nIn a Facebook post Tuesday night, they said \"We are working closely with local authorities, and our primary focus remains on the well-being of residents, staff, and their families.\"\n\nOne woman who works at the facility said she has been trying to contact co-workers, but no one is answering their phones. That woman also told Action News that she flagged a gas smell over the weekend.\n\nA man who showed up at the scene said his wife works at the nursing home and he hasn't yet heard from her.\n\nRescuers were called in from neighboring Montgomery County, the city of Philadelphia and New Jersey.\n\n\"I saw smoke and I saw car after car after car was a fire truck or ambulance from all over the city, from all over,\" State Rep. Tina Davis, whose district includes the center, told the Associated Press. She approached the scene in her car but did not want to interfere with response efforts.\n\nThe American Red Cross of Southeastern Pennsylvania says anyone who needs help locating a family member that has been affected is asked to go to Lower Bucks Hospital, 501 Bath Road, Bristol, or call 215-785-9200.\n\n\"It's just so sad - it's that hopeful time of year. This is just something that is sad for everybody and the families and the workers that are there. I hope there's positive results from this. We don't know at this point,\" Davis said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "A 25-year-old startup founder said he starts each day with a nutrient-packed protein smoothie.\n\nMax Marchione is the cofounder of Superpower, a personalized health testing app that raised $30 million in funding earlier this year, backed by celebritiess like Steve Aoki and Logan Paul.\n\n\"Health is becoming a status symbol,\" Marchione told Business Insider. \"Twenty-somethings talking about their biomarkers, it would not have happened three years ago, but that is the defining young culture nowadays.\"\n\nRunning the company is no easy feat: Marchione works seven days a week, putting in more than 12 hours a day.\n\nThat means his self-care routine is precisely dialed in.\n\nMarchione says he has always taken an unconventional, even contrarian approach, exploring beyond what mainstream medicine recommends.\n\nAs a teen, he was an early adopter of fitness wearables like the Oura ring, and got into blue-light-blocking glasses and mouth taping — trends that, despite some mixed evidence, have become incredibly popular in wellness today.\n\nHe's also a big fan of peptide injections, such as the \"Wolverine shot,\" a compound called BPC-157. It is not FDA-approved. He began taking it in the hopes of accelerating his recovery after suffering a soccer injury.\n\nBut one constant in his health routine is much simpler: a daily smoothie.\n\nAs his first meal of the day, it packs in 50 grams of protein and 20 grams of fiber in 400 total calories.\n\nThe recipe includes fruit rich in antioxidants, plant-based compounds that research suggests help mitigate the cellular damage of aging. It also helps him get enough fiber, a crucial nutrient for gut health. Fiber helps nourish the microbiome in a way that may help prevent illnesses like heart disease and cancer as we age.\n\nCombined with protein (the primary building block for muscle), fiber helps improve fullness after eating and supports balanced blood sugar.\n\nMarchione's full \"smoothie stack,\" which he published on his website for other people to try, includes ingredients for gut health and energy, like:\n\nThis is a very high protein smoothie. The sweet spot for total daily protein intake to build muscle is about 0.7 grams per pound of body weight daily, studies suggest. For a 140-pound person, a single serving of Marchione's smoothie would be more than half the recommended amount in that range.\n\nIf he's loading up on extra protein in the smoothie, he adds digestive enzymes to make the protein easier to absorb.\n\n\"I find that if I don't do this, I have brain fog from too much protein at once,\" he wrote on his website.",

Some union leaders said they would go along with the elimination of the subsidies, which had been in place for almost two decades.\n\nBolivia's centrist President Rodrigo Paz, who took office on Nov. 8, ended the fuel subsidy that previous left-wing governments had maintained for more than 20 years, keeping gas prices at $0.53 per liter. An emergency decree by Paz last week put the price of gasoline at around $1 per liter.\n\n“The country is sick and must be healed,” Paz said on Sunday in a town hall meeting that was broadcast on state television.\n\n“Every day, $10 million is spent on a subsidy that benefits smugglers” who resell the subsidized fuel in Bolivia and abroad, Paz added.\n\nBusiness groups in Bolivia have backed Paz’s new economic measures, which are expected to ease dollar shortages and make it easier for companies to import goods and capital.\n\n“We knew that at some point the subsidies would end” said Luis Paco, a union leader representing merchants in the city of El Alto. “There were no negotiations over the new adjustments, but we knew this was inevitable.”\n\nBus drivers unions stayed away from Monday’s protests after Bolivia’s government said they will be able to import auto parts duty-free. Paz has also mandated a 20% increase in the minimum wage.\n\nImports of gasoline and diesel — costing the government up to $3 billion a year — had depleted foreign currency reserves and worsened Bolivia's biggest economic crisis in four decades, following the decline of the nation’s natural gas exports.\n\nBut unions that have traditionally aligned with left-wing political leaders — including those representing miners and coca growers — went on strike on Monday, demanding that fuel subsidies be reinstated.\n\nLa Paz police sealed off access to the central square where the palace housing the government is located, to prevent demonstrators from entering.\n\nIn the neighboring city of El Alto, local councils blocked some avenues. There were also road blocks on highways in six of the country’s nine regions, according to Bolivia’s highway administration agency.\n\n“We are in the streets in a struggle that will continue until that decree eliminating the subsidy is repealed,” mining leader Andrés Paye told reporters. “This government approves regulations to favor business owners and punish the poor.”\n\nUnions aligned with former President Evo Morales, led a massive march in Cochabamba, the Andean country’s third-largest city, and blocked two major highways in the east of the country.\n\nThe bus drivers unions did not join the strike, after negotiating over the weekend with Paz's new government.\n\n“We will continue to work, to serve the people” said Lucio Gomez, a leader of a transport workers union.\n\nCarlos Cordero, a political science professor in La Paz, said the union behind the strike was trying to “show its strength” ahead of next year's elections for governors and mayors. But the relatively low turnout on Monday showed that the union has been weakened, he said.\n\n“In many sectors of the country, there is a conviction that the adjustment was necessary” Cordero said.",

    "fullText": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump is gathering with top national security officials on Monday, a meeting that comes as the U.S. Coast Guard steps up efforts to interdict oil tankers in the Caribbean Sea as part of the Republican administration's escalating pressure campaign on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's government.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Navy Secretary John Phelan are scheduled to join Trump, who is vacationing at his Mar-a-Lago resort, for what the White House called a \"major announcement.\" Trump plans to discuss a shipbuilding initiative at the event, according to a White House official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nBut Trump's gathering of key members of his national security team also comes at yet another inflection point in Trump's four-month pressure campaign on the Maduro government, which began with the stated purpose of stemming the flow of illegal drugs from the South American nation but has developed into something more amorphous.\n\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry has started evacuating the families of diplomats from Venezuela, according to a European intelligence official speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information.\n\nThe official told The Associated Press the evacuations include women and children and began on Friday. The official said Russian Foreign Ministry officials are assessing the situation in Venezuela in “very grim tones.” The White House and Kremlin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn the Caribbean, the U.S. Coast Guard on Monday continued for the second day to chase a sanctioned oil tanker that the Trump administration describes as part of a “dark fleet” Venezuela is using to evade U.S. sanctions. The tanker, the official added, is flying under a false flag and is under a U.S. judicial seizure order.\n\nIt is the third ship pursued by the Coast Guard, which on Saturday seized a Panama-flagged vessel called Centuries that U.S. officials said was part of the Venezuelan shadow fleet.\n\nThe Coast Guard, with assistance from the Navy, seized a sanctioned tanker called Skipper on Dec. 10, also part of the shadow fleet of tankers that the U.S. says operates on the fringes of the law to move sanctioned cargo. That ship was registered in Panama.\n\nTrump, after that first seizure, said the U.S. would carry out a “blockade” of Venezuela. Trump has repeatedly said that Maduro's days in power are numbered.\n\nLast week, Trump demanded that Venezuela return assets that it seized from U.S. oil companies years ago, justifying anew his announcement of a “blockade” against sanctioned oil tankers traveling to or from the South American country.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose agency oversees the Coast Guard, said in a Monday appearance on “Fox & Friends” that the targeting of tankers is intended to send “a message around the world that the illegal activity that Maduro is participating in cannot stand, he needs to be gone, and that we will stand up for our people.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Defense Department, under Trump's orders, continues its campaign of attacks on smaller vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean that it alleges are carrying drugs to the United States and beyond.\n\nAt least 104 people have been killed in 28 known strikes since early September. The strikes have faced scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and human rights activists, who say the administration has offered scant evidence that its targets are indeed drug smugglers and that the fatal strikes amount to extrajudicial killings.",

    "description": "Scientists have imaged heat traveling as a wave, called \"second sound,\" in superfluid quantum gas. It may unlock mysteries of neutron stars and superconductors.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nUsually, when something gets warmed up, heat tends to spread outward before eventually dissipating. But things are a little different in the world of superfluid quantum gas.\n\nFor the first time, MIT scientists have successfully imaged how heat actually travels in a wave, known as a “second sound,” through this exotic fluid.\n\nUnderstanding this dynamic could help answer questions about high-temperature superconductors and neutron stars.\n\nIn the world of average, everyday materials, heat tends to spread out from a localized source. Drop a burning coal into a pot of water, and that liquid will slowly rise in temperature before its heat eventually dissipates. But the world is full of rare, exotic materials that don’t exactly play by these thermal rules.\n\nInstead of spreading out as one would expect, these superfluid quantum gasses “slosh” heat side to side—it essentially propagates as a wave. Scientists call this behavior a material’s “second sound” (the first being ordinary sound via a density wave). Although this phenomenon has been observed before, it’s never been imaged. But recently, scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) were finally able to capture this movement of pure heat by developing a new method of thermography (a.k.a. heat-mapping).\n\nThe results of this study were published in the journal Science, and in an university press release highlighting the achievement, MIT assistant professor and co-author Richard Fletcher continued the boiling pot analogy to describe the inherent strangeness of “second sound” in these exotic superfluids.\n\n“It’s as if you had a tank of water and made one half nearly boiling,” Fletcher said. “If you then watched, the water itself might look totally calm, but suddenly the other side is hot, and then the other side is hot, and the heat goes back and forth, while the water looks totally still.”\n\nThese superfluids are created when a cloud of atoms is subjected to ultra-cold temperatures approaching absolute zero (−459.67 °F). In this rare state, atoms behave differently, as they create an essentially friction-free fluid. It’s in this frictionless state that heat has been theorized to propagate like a wave.\n\n“Second sound is the hallmark of superfluidity, but in ultracold gases so far you could only see it in this faint reflection of the density ripples that go along with it,” lead author Martin Zwierlein said in a press statement. “The character of the heat wave could not be proven before.”\n\nTo finally capture this second sound in action, Zweierlein and his team had to think outside the usual thermal box, as there’s a big problem trying to track heat of an ultracold object—it doesn’t emit the usual infrared radiation. So, MIT scientists designed a way to leverage radio frequencies to track certain subatomic particles known as “lithium-6 fermions,” which can be captured via different frequencies in relation to their temperature (i.e. warmer temperatures mean higher frequencies, and vice versa). This novel technique allowed the researchers to essentially zero in on the “hotter” frequencies (which were still very much cold) and track the resulting second wave over time.\n\nThis might feel like a big “so what?” After all, when’s the last time you had a close encounter with a superfluid quantum gas? But ask a materials scientist or astronomer, and you’ll get an entirely different answer.\n\nWhile exotic superfluids may not fill up our lives (yet), understanding the properties of second wave movement could help questions regarding high-temperature superconductors (again, still at very low temperatures) or the messy physics that lie at the heart of neutron stars.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Japanese authorities have approved a decision to restart the world’s biggest nuclear power plant, which has sat dormant for more than a decade following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, in a pivotal moment as the country looks to looks to shift its energy supply away from fossil fuels.\n\nDespite nerves from many local residents, the Niigata prefectural assembly, home to the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant, approved a bill on Monday that clears the way for utility company Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) to restart one of the plant’s seven reactors.\n\nThe company plans to bring the No. 6 reactor back online around January 20, Japan’s public broadcaster NHK reported.\n\nJapan has taken a cautious approach to nuclear energy since a massive 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami in 2011 triggered a nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. It was the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.\n\nFollowing the disaster, Japan shut down all 54 of its nuclear power stations including Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, which sits in the coastal and port region of Niigata about 320 kilometers (200 miles) north of Tokyo on Japan’s main island of Honshu.\n\nJapan has since restarted 14 of the 33 nuclear reactors that remain operable, according to the World Nuclear Association.\n\nThe Niigata plant will be the first to reopen under the operation of TEPCO, the company that ran the Fukushima Daiichi power station. It has been trying to reassure residents of the restart plan is safe.\n\n“We remain firmly committed to never repeating such an accident and ensuring Niigata residents never experience anything similar,” said TEPCO spokesperson Masakatsu Takata, Reuters news agency reported.\n\nBefore the Fukushima disaster, Japan’s nuclear reactors had provided around 30% of the country’s electricity. Since then, Japan has increased its reliance on costly imported fossil fuels, including coal and gas, to power the country and keep the lights on.\n\nAbout 60–70% of Japan’s power generation comes from imported fossil fuels, which cost the country about 10.7 trillion yen ($68 billion) last year alone.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who took office two months ago, is a strong proponent of nuclear power and has pushed to revive the crippled industry to drive down costs, and tackle inflation and a stagnant economy.\n\nJapan is the world’s fifth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide, after China, the United States, India and Russia, according to the International Energy Agency. But it has committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050, and renewable energy was at the center of its latest energy plan published earlier this year, with a push for greater investments in solar and wind.\n\nThe country’s energy demands are also expected to increase in the coming years due to a boom in energy-hungry data centers that power AI infrastructure.\n\nTo achieve its energy and climate goals, Japan aims to double the share of nuclear power in its electricity mix to 20% by 2040.\n\nBut the memory of the Fukushima disaster endures, and some local residents are wary of reviving nuclear power due to safety concerns.\n\n“We know firsthand the risk of a nuclear accident and cannot dismiss it,” Ayako Oga, 52, told Reuters. Oga had settled in Niigata after fleeing the Fukushima disaster. She told the news agency that her old home was inside the exclusion zone and she still struggles with post-traumatic stress-like symptoms.\n\nA survey published by the Niigata prefecture in October found 60% of residents did not think conditions for the restart had been met. Nearly 70% were worried about TEPCO operating the plant, Reuters reported.\n\nOn its website, TEPCO said Kashiwazaki-Kariwa had undergone multiple inspections and upgrades and that the company had learned “the lessons of Fukushima.”\n\nThe company said new seawalls and watertight doors would provide “stronger protection against tsunamis” and that mobile generators and more fire trucks would be on hand for “cooling support” in an emergency. It also said the plant now had “upgraded filtering systems designed to control the spread of radioactive materials.”\n\nIn late October, TEPCO conducted “a full round of integrity checks” at Unit 6 and declared the reactor fit for startup.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Dec 22 (Reuters) - A revamp of China's electricity market is boosting the economics of storing power just as international demand surges, sparking a boom for the Chinese energy storage manufacturers that already dominate globally.\n\nChinese firms are on track for a 75% jump this year in global shipments of lithium-ion battery cells for energy storage, ​according to one estimate.\n\nThey have exported more than $65 billion worth of storage and electric-vehicle batteries this year, cementing their dominance in a sector vital to backing up wind and solar ‌and keeping power coursing through artificial-intelligence data centres.\n\nThe surge in sales is driven by data centres and renewables domestically, as well as by Chinese reforms and subsidies that are boosting general demand for energy storage. International demand is rising in tandem with the ‌surging growth in data centres, a need to back up Europe's ageing grid and China's burgeoning renewable energy business in the Middle East, analysts say.\n\n\"These leading energy storage cell makers, they have full orders. Many of them are basically working double shifts now to try and meet demand,\" said analyst Cosimo Ries at policy research firm Trivium China. The boom \"is one of the biggest surprises of the year, I think, in China's energy space.\"\n\nUBS last month raised its 2026 forecast for global battery-energy storage installations by 25%.\n\nThe International Energy Agency forecasts global investment in battery storage facilities will rise 16% this year to $66 billion. Much of that is ⁠set to be captured by Chinese firms because while Tesla is number ‌one in energy storage systems, China dominates production of the tiny cells inside them.\n\nAll of the six top global cell suppliers - Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL), HiTHIUM, EVE Energy, BYD, CALB and REPT BATTERO - are Chinese, according to a January-to-September ranking by consultancy Infolink. Of the top 10, only Japan's AESC is not from China.\n\nEVE's ‍energy storage sales volumes rose 35.51% in the first three quarters from the same period last year. REPT BATTERO's third-quarter shipments of all batteries set a record high. Top EV players CATL and BYD did not break out energy storage shipments through the third quarter. Storage has historically made up less of their revenue than automotive batteries and EVs, although the proportion is growing.\n\n\"Pairing solar with storage has effectively become the only solution for meeting U.S. AI ​data-centre power needs,\" UBS analyst Yishu Yan told a media briefing. \"U.S. AI data centre power demand is very robust, but power is the biggest bottleneck, and U.S. baseload power - gas, nuclear, thermal - they ‌won't grow much in the next five years.\"",

    "description": "The story behind Wales-based Wunda Group, which designs and supplies energy-efficient underfloor heating systems.",
    "fullText": "When entrepreneurs Charles and Josephine Pugh rented a property with \"uncomfortable and uncontrollable\" underfloor heating (UFH), it sparked a move away from the made-to-order furniture world they had been invested in since the late 1970s.\n\nThe couple, who had founded British retailer Multiyork in 1978, set up Wunda Group in 2006 at the height of the 'green homes revolution' when barn conversions and self-builds were de rigueur.\n\nThe Pughs’ home heating issue had centred on underfloor screed — a level layer of concrete where piping has traditionally been embedded into — with pipe centres too far apart. With no controls, there was a slow response time to heat and the floor became too hot. The Pughs thought the existing systems were \"slow and antiquated\".\n\nMonmouthshire-based Wunda now designs and supplies energy-efficient UFH systems and has cut through to the DIY consumer at a time of rising energy bills. The company employs 90 staff and says it has booked over £10m in sales this year.\n\nThe heating firm is also a family affair. With Charles as CEO and Josephine CFO, their daughter Josephine is managing director, while grandson Sam Jump is currently head of business development.\n\nThe business took off in 2008 when Wunda reorientated as installers looked for kits and components after the self-build market collapsed.\n\nIn 2010, their former base near Chepstow was in an old chicken farm shed renovated to offices. The Pughs still visited trade shows and had come across one American exhibitor’s aluminum chip board panel with grooves, which was employed as a last fix in the build.\n\nThey pioneered a version with high-compressed polystyrene and put a sample down in the chicken shed, with a heat pump which moved outside thermal energy internally. The closer piping also meant it could be run at lower temperatures.\n\nJump, who was working in the warehouse at the time and previously led a team of outreachers offering membership, recalled: “Everyone was walking around in T-shirts during winter and the response rate was unreal, the heat pump was operating at the optimum flow temperature with a co-efficient performance.”\n\nHowever, their product was initially met with scepticism from installers unwilling to test new products. “Where most people think of UFH as this uncomfortable system, we now have a rapid response system and it warms up as fast as radiators, if not quicker.”\n\nA booming DIY industry, renovating homes or building extensions instead of moving, has helped boost Wunda’s profits.",

    "title": "The evolution of expendability: Why some ants traded armor for numbers",
    "description": "Ants with lots of workers tend to put less energy into making them armored.",
    "fullText": "The trade-off between quality and quantity is a fundamental economic dilemma. Now, a team of British, American, and Japanese researchers describes how it applies to biology, as well. They have discovered that this dilemma most likely shaped the evolutionary trajectory of ants, one of Earth’s most successful groups of organisms.\n\nTheir study reveals that, as ant societies grew in complexity and numbers, they didn’t just make their workers smaller—they also made them cheaper.\n\nIn the insect world, the exoskeleton known as the cuticle serves as a protective barrier against predators, pathogens, and desiccation, while providing the structural framework for muscle attachment. But this protection comes at a price. Building a robust cuticle requires significant amounts of nitrogen and rare minerals like zinc and manganese. While skimping on armor for an individual insect may be a death sentence, the evolution of ants apparently found a way around it.\n\n“There’s this question in biology of what happens to individuals as societies they are in get more complex?” said Evan Economo, an entomologist at the University of Maryland and co-author of the study. “For example, the individuals may themselves become simpler because tasks that a solitary organism would need to complete can be handled by a collective.”\n\nEconomo’s team hypothesized that the metabolic balance behind investing in cuticles in social insects like ants could favor the collective over the individual. The idea was that a colony of 10,000 workers could lose a few individuals to a predator without much consequence, so investing heavily in each worker’s defenses would seem like a waste of precious nutrients. To test this hypothesis, they examined whether ant lineages that maintain massive, specialized workforces reduce the investment in their individual workers’ exoskeletons.\n\nTo test this idea, the researchers needed to pull off a comparative study on the anatomy of ants at an unprecedented scale. “We worked with scans of ant specimens and species from all over the world to capture the global diversity of ants,” Economo says. The team used a massive database called Antscan, which contains three-dimensional X-ray microtomography imaging of ants from around the globe.\n\nMicrotomography works similarly to medical CT scans, but at a vastly higher resolution. Still, on its own, the technique could only generate lots of precise data—it still had to be interpreted. Parsing through 3D imagery of over 880 specimens, including workers, queens, and males belonging to over 500 different species, was another challenge. “The 3D scanning itself is a very advanced technology,” says Arthur Matte, a researcher at the University of Cambridge and lead author of the study. “But once you have the ants in three dimensions, it’s still very hard to segment manually every tissue you’re interested in.”\n\nTo solve this, Matte developed a computer vision algorithm for “unsupervised segmentation.” Because the cuticle is always the outermost tissue of an arthropod, the algorithm could automatically identify and measure the volume of the exoskeleton across all ants in the dataset.\n\nThe first thing scientists noticed when the results poured in was that cuticle investment varied wildly, ranging from 6 percent to 35 percent of an ant’s total body volume. So, the next thing they focused on was figuring out the reasons behind these variations.\n\nThe team started checking how factors like diet, temperature, humidity, and foraging style correlated with the size of the cuticle. To get a handle on this, segmented 3D scans were fed into evolutionary models. “One of the most insightful things we did was to individually remove such variables from the models to estimate their contributions to the final cuticle investment,” Matte explains. This way, scientists learned that temperature was responsible for just 12 percent of variation in cuticle size and diet—especially its nitrogen content—explained another 37 percent. But the factor that had the strongest impact on the model was the colony size.\n\nAnts that invested less in their cuticle tended to have significantly larger colony sizes. More surprisingly, this reduction in cuticle investment and the resulting increase in colony size appeared to be associated with higher diversification rates. In biological terms, squishier ants could evolve to occupy new niches much faster than their heavily armored cousins. “Requiring less nitrogen could make these ants more versatile and able to conquer new environments,” Matte suggests. This efficiency may have allowed ants to transition from a diet of high-protein prey to more abundant but less nutritious liquid sugar sources, like honeydew or floral nectar.\n\n“Ants reduce per-worker investment in one of the most nutritionally expensive tissues for the good of the collective,” Matte explains. “They’re shifting from self-investment toward a distributed workforce.”\n\nThe researchers think the pattern they observed in ants reflects a more universal trend in the evolution of societal complexity. The transition from solitary life to complex societies echoes the transition from single-celled organisms to multicellular ones.\n\nIn a single-celled organism, a cell must be a “jack-of-all-trades,” performing every function necessary for survival. In a multicellular animal, however, individual cells often become simpler and more specialized, relying on the collective for protection and resources.\n\n“It’s a pattern that echoes the evolution of multicellularity, where cooperative units can be individually simpler than a solitary cell, yet collectively capable of far greater complexity,” says Matte. Still, the question of whether underinvesting in individuals to boost the collective makes sense for creatures other than ants remains open, and it most likely isn’t as much about nutritional economics as it is about sex.\n\nThe study focused on ants that already have a reproductive division of labor, one where workers do not reproduce. This social structure is likely the key prerequisite for the cheap worker strategy. For the team, this is the reason we haven’t, at least so far, found similar evolutionary patterns in more complex social organisms like wolves, which live in packs—or humans with their amazingly complex societies. Wolves and people are both social, but maintain a high degree of individual self-interest regarding reproduction. Ant workers could be made expendable because they don’t pass their own genes—they are essentially extensions of the queen’s reproductive strategy.\n\nBefore looking for signs of ant-like approaches to quality versus quantity dilemmas in other species, the team wants to take an even closer look at ants. Economo, Matte, and their colleagues seek to expand their analysis to other ant tissues, such as the nervous system and muscles, to see if the cheapening of individuals extends beyond the exoskeleton. They are also looking at ant genomes to see what genetic innovations allowed for the shift from quality to quantity.  “We still need a lot of work to understand ants’ evolution,” Matte says.\n\nScience Advances. 2025.

    "title": "Palm Beach is buzzing with Wall Street energy this winter. Here's our insider guide to the hotspots.",
    "description": "Wall Street arrived in Palm Beach early this winter. From Milos to Mary Lou's, these restaurants and nightlife spots are leading the scene.",
    "fullText": "Ask me about the ZIP code 33480, and I'll have plenty to say.\n\nIt's Palm Beach, a place I know well. I grew up in South Florida, and even now, I spend a good amount of time here, watching how the island continues to evolve. It also happens to overlap with my job: as a Wall Street reporter, many of the firms we cover — from Goldman Sachs to Citadel — have built out significant \"Wall Street South\" operations in and around Palm Beach County over the past few years.\n\nThis winter, locals tell me the island feels especially busy — noticeably earlier than usual. Restaurants are filling up weeks ahead of the holidays, reservations are disappearing quickly, and the finance crowd is playing a noticeable role, restaurant insiders say.\n\n\"We've never seen the island this full this early in the season,\" Alex Melillo, a partner at Mary Lou's, one of West Palm's newest and hottest nightlife venues, told me.\n\nTo get a broader sense of where people are actually going, I asked around. In addition to speaking with restaurant operators and longtime denizens of \"the Island,\" I checked in with some local contacts in finance: a money manager who works for a large bank and a trusted friend who works in private asset management.\n\nIn my conversations, the same names kept coming up — places where Wall Streeters, finance professionals, and winter visitors congregate when they're here.\n\nI recently had a meal at Buccan and wasn't disappointed. Unlike many popular Palm Beach hot spots that lean old-world, the space feels particularly modern, matching the restaurant's more cosmopolitan approach to dining.\n\nThe menu is built around avant-garde plates meant for sharing, with dishes that change seasonally but often include standouts like hamachi tiradito, inventive crudos, and rich pastas.\n\nWhen I went with a friend, we split the sweet corn agnolotti — and it's an absolute must. The room draws a lively mix of locals and visiting professionals, and it's the kind of place where dinners tend to stretch. Next door is Imoto, Buccan's sister restaurant, a sleek sushi spot if you're craving Japanese.\n\nCucina is often the first stop when my friends and I are looking for a fun night out.\n\nIt's Palm Beach's playground, an island favorite for seeing and being seen — and a place that tends to extend a simple dinner into a much longer affair when the music comes on. Specialized lights illuminate the ceiling in keeping with the DJ's beat. Tables feel like prime real estate, and the room gets even more packed as the evening goes on.\n\nOn busy nights, it's clear this is where a large cross-section of Palm Beach society — including professionals from out of town — has descended. The door can be selective, but once you're inside, the expectation is that you'll stay awhile and dance. I recommend stopping by Lola 41 around the corner for a drink first.\n\nEstiatorio Milos opened earlier this year on the West Palm Beach waterfront, bringing one of the most respected names in Mediterranean seafood to South Florida. The restaurant has the same bright, luminous aesthetic found at other Milos locations — including Hudson Yards — with fresh fish displayed on ice and a glowing bar that makes an ideal backdrop for conversation on a buzzy night.\n\nAside from Avra in Sunny Isles, this may be the best Greek restaurant in South Florida right now. A must-order for the table is the Milos chips — paper-thin zucchini and eggplant, lightly fried and genuinely impossible to resist — alongside simply prepared whole fish grilled with lemon and olive oil.\n\nIf you're craving a taste of Manhattan — or Paris — in Palm Beach, La Goulue has become one of the island's most popular destinations. The South Florida offshoot of the classic Upper East Side French restaurant serves familiar staples like cheese soufflé, lobster bisque, and rich French onion soup, drawing a steady mix of locals and winter visitors.\n\nIt's rarely quiet. \"I was passing by La Goulue the other day, and there wasn't an empty seat,\" said Daphne Nikolopoulos, editor in chief of Palm Beach Illustrated, a popular glossy title in the area. The restaurant has become a dependable choice for everything from long family dinners to client meals — the kind of place finance and business guests return to repeatedly once they're settled in town for the season.\n\nAn Upper East Side mainstay that opened in Palm Beach in 2021, Le Bilboquet has become a dependable stop for winter visitors looking for a taste of home. The French bistro serves its signature dishes — including cajun chicken, tuna tartare, and Dover sole — in a setting that works just as well for long lunches as for leisurely dinners.\n\nThe restaurant has been especially busy this season. \"We're certainly seeing a strong presence from the finance and business community this winter,\" a spokesperson for the restaurant told me. They said they've also seen an increase in group meals and celebrations, \"including more corporate and business dinners, often with groups of eight to 10 guests,\" tied to end-of-year and holiday gatherings.\n\nIf you're interested in a memorable night out, Mary Lou's, which opened this year to much fanfare, is arguably the area's hottest ticket. Inside, you'll find a space that's dark and sultry, anchored by a dramatic chandelier over the bar and a massive disco ball overhead. Visiting celebrities often pass through, tucked into the discrete banquettes along the wall.\n\nMelillo, one of Mary Lou's three partners, said the season has ramped up earlier than usual, driven in large part by visiting finance and corporate guests who are spending longer stretches in Palm Beach and going out more frequently. For Wall Streeters and the local professional crowd, the environment feels inviting but still upscale. Expect to see well-dressed partiers in sport jackets and toasting with free-flowing libations.\n\nJoe Cervasio, the partner who oversees programming, said the venue has leaned into booking touring DJs and festival-level talent as demand has grown.\n\n\"I cannot hold enough champagne — it's literally falling through our fingertips,\" Melillo said.\n\nReservations are strongly recommended.\n\nOne of the most talked-about openings on Palm Beach Island this season is The Polo Room, the new restaurant led by internationally known polo player Nacho Figueras. The menu is inspired by the legendary polo star's Argentinian roots.\n\nNot to be mistaken for an offshoot of a separate restaurant — Ralph Lauren's Polo Bar on 55th Street in Midtown — the space opened in early December and has quickly drawn attention from locals and winter visitors. It features an equestrian aesthetic throughout.\n\n\"Without question, The Polo Room is fantastic,\" said Nikolopoulos, who was one of the new restaurant's first customers. \"Figueras doesn't do anything halfway — he's meticulous and very professional with all his endeavors.\"\n\nShe said the food stood out, pointing to the empanadas and steaks in particular, and noted that Figueras has incorporated family recipes into the menu — like his mom's signature chocolate mousse for dessert.",

    "fullText": "Analysts see ‘global construction frenzy that shows no signs of slowing’ amid surge in demand from AI boom\n\nA new report finds that investment in the worldwide data center market reached $61bn this year, setting a new record atop the wave of the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nThe analysis by S&P Global, first reported by CNBC, documented what the market intelligence firm called a “global construction frenzy that shows no signs of slowing”, to build out the massive real estate, hardware, and energy requirements driven by insatiable demand from AI companies. S&P pegged 2024’s investment in the data center market at $60.8bn, just below the 2025 number.\n\n“Unable to buy, many investors are turning to new builds,” wrote Iuri Struta, an analyst for S&P Global.\n\nThere are approximately 500 data centers in the United Kingdom, compared with about 4,000 in the United States, according to Data Center Map, which tracks the facilities globally.\n\nStruta, the S&P Global analyst, said he does not see the demand for data centers slowing.\n\n“The global data center footprint is projected to expand at a faster rate over the next five years than it did in the previous five, spurred by demand for energy- and computer-intensive AI workloads,” said Struta.\n\nS&P Global’s report comes at a time when some investors worry that the entire artificial intelligence sector may be in the midst of huge overspending for unproven ongoing returns.\n\nLast week, Oracle’s shares dropped 11% after it reported lower quarterly earnings than analysts had expected, which in turn dragged the stock prices on some other major companies in AI. Some companies such as Oracle, along with Nvidia and OpenAI, have been criticized recently for making deals with one another that seem circular to many investors.\n\nEarlier this year, the International Energy Agency noted in a lengthy report that, globally, “electricity demand for data centres more than doubles by 2030”, reaching 945 terawatt hours (TWh), or just more than “Japan’s total electricity consumption today”.\n\nThis month, a trio of analysts from Deutsche Bank put out a staggering chart indicating that OpenAI alone will burn through $143bn between 2024 and 2029, the year before the company claims it will turn a profit. That chart shows how much more the ChatGPT maker, seen as a bellwether of the AI industry, plans to spend relative to other tech giants of the last two decades, including Amazon, Tesla and Uber, reached profitability.\n\n“Of course, OpenAI may continue to attract significant funding and could ultimately develop products that generate substantial profits and revolutionise the world,” Jim Reid, managing director, global head of macro research and thematic strategy at Deutsche Bank, wrote.\n\n“But at present, no startup in history has operated with losses on anything approaching this scale. We are firmly in uncharted territory.”",

    "description": "Ukraine’s dramatic escalation of its sea-drone attacks on tankers carrying Russian oil could spread to the English Channel, experts have warned.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine’s dramatic escalation of its sea-drone attacks on tankers carrying Russian oil could spread to the English Channel, experts have warned.\n\nThe hit on an Oman-flagged tanker on Friday widened the Ukrainian operation from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, signalling that sanctioned tankers could be hit anywhere on their journey.\n\n“The Ukrainians are now operating across a much wider area. If you’re a shadow fleet vessel then there’s now a risk wherever you are,” said Matthew Wright, of trade intelligence firm Kpler.\n\n“You get shadow fleet vessels that come out of the Baltic Sea, they are essentially going through the North Sea. The threat to them is now higher.”\n\nMichelle Bockmann, from maritime data company Windward, said the Ukrainians were likely to continue focusing on empty tankers rather than those laden with oil, but the attacks could impose massive costs on the vessel operators.\n\nShe added: “Marine insurers have been saying for quite a while now that one of these vessels, if they have a casualty, especially if they go through the English Channel, that they’re a billion-dollar marine accident waiting to happen.\n\n“Ukraine is aware of this risk, and I think that’s why this is a new strategy, an evolving strategy, and definitely one to watch.”\n\nThere are close to 1,000 tankers involved in Russia’s shadow fleet – the vessels, often false-flagged and with obscure ownership, that ferry crude or refined Russian oil to customers primarily in India and China.\n\nAbout 600 carry exclusively Russian oil, which puts them within the Western sanctions net. Roughly another 350 carry Russian oil alongside other cargo.\n\nUkraine has carried out drone attacks on three shadow tankers in the Black Sea in the past month, and is also thought to have been behind an apparent limpet-mine explosion off the coast of Senegal.\n\nExperts said the broadening attacks could prompt some vessel owners to question whether the risk of working for Vladimir Putin was still worth the reward.\n\nThe attacks could drive up ship owners’ insurance premiums. The insurers are believed to be mostly Russian or Chinese, and Kpler said operators might start to worry about whether they would get a payout if attacked.\n\nKpler’s Mr Wright said: “The London insurance market is incredibly well capitalised. It can handle a lot of large claims because the risk is spread. Whereas we don’t have a lot of visibility of how well capitalised the insurers are who cover the Russian shadow fleet.\n\n“If you’re a shadow fleet owner, you’d be asking whether you might get paid out. It will make a lot of the owners who have been leading players in the shadow fleet think about whether the risk-reward is worth it.”\n\nThe vessel owners could react to the bigger risks by raising the prices they charge Russia, further squeezing the Kremlin’s war chest.\n\nUkrainian security sources told local media this calculus made these tankers fair game.\n\n“The aggressor state used this tanker to circumvent sanctions and earn money that was used for the war against Ukraine,” the sources were quoted as saying.\n\n“Therefore ... this is an absolutely legitimate target. The enemy must understand that Ukraine will not stop, and will beat him anywhere in the world.”\n\nThe Ukrainian action underscores the extent to which civilian tankers have become involved in geopolitical conflict and tension this year, with the US also blockading oil-freight traffic around Venezuela.\n\nMs Bockmann said this blurring of the line between the commercial and military domains was making the industry “uneasy”.\n\nArsenio Dominguez, secretary-general of the UN’s International Maritime Organisation, this week urged restraint.\n\n“As the situation continues to escalate in the Black Sea, I call on all parties to refrain from targeting innocent seafarers, port workers and merchant ships,” he said.\n\n“Shipping should not be used as collateral in geopolitical situations and there is an increased environmental risk developing.”\n\nThe Ukrainians appear to be targeting only empty tankers, to avoid triggering an environmental disaster.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "Texas Pacific Land has generated substantial returns for long-term investors as Permian Basin oil and gas production has surged.",
    "fullText": "Texas Pacific Land is a high-margin cash cow.\n\nIts land is valuable because it's located in the largest oil-and-gas-producing region in the United States.\n\nThe company is one of the safest ways to invest in growing oil and gas production.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Texas Pacific Land ›\n\nNetflix captured the spotlight in November when it executed its long-awaited 10-for-1 stock split. With just two weeks left in 2025, many investors probably figure they'll have to wait for 2026 for more high-profile splits.\n\nEarlier this month, S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) component Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE: TPL) announced a 3-for-1 stock split. Trading of the split-adjusted shares will take place on Dec. 23.\n\nHere's why Texas Pacific is no ordinary oil and gas company and why the high-margin cash cow could be an excellent gift for your portfolio this December.\n\nTexas Pacific's stock split will triple the number of shares outstanding while reducing the share price by two-thirds, making it easier for investors to buy one full share of the company at around $280 per share. This compares to around $840 per share at the time of this writing.\n\nStock splits can indicate that management is confident in a company's future earnings growth and thus, a higher future stock price. Even though stock splits don't impact a company's value or market capitalization, they're still generally received favorably by investors.\n\nWhat makes Texas Pacific's split particularly interesting is that the stock is down 24.1% year to date -- but stock splits tend to occur after a stock has run up in price. To make matters even more interesting, the company issued a 3-for-1 stock split in March 2024.\n\nIt's incredibly rare for a company to issue stock splits in back-to-back years, but Texas Pacific more than doubled last year, has crushed the S&P 500 over the last five years, and is up 18-fold over the last decade. There are plenty of reasons to believe it has a long runway for future earnings growth.\n\nThe oil and gas industry is capital-intensive. Upstream exploration and production companies are the most sensitive to fluctuations in oil and gas prices. Midstream companies, which transport and store hydrocarbons, tend to have less price sensitivity due to long-term contracts but are incredibly capital-intensive and depend on growing demand to justify infrastructure spending. Similarly, the margins of downstream refining and marketing companies can fluctuate based on input costs, such as oil prices and the cyclical demand for refined products.",

    "fullText": "New York Giants defensive coordinator Charlie Bullen showered praise on rookie linebacker Abdul Carter following his dominant performance in a Week 15 loss to the Washington Commanders, calling it \"a great performance\" and exactly the type of impact plays Carter is capable of making.\n\n\"Those are the types of games and plays that I think he's capable of making,\" Bullen told reporters on Thursday. \"It was great to see, it kind of came together for him, and he helped the team win in a big way and made some impactful plays.\"\n\nCarter's breakout comes after a challenging start to his rookie season, during which he was benched twice and fined by former head coach Brian Daboll for repeated tardiness.\n\nFollowing a bye week in which teammates called him out, Carter rededicated himself to the process. He has since credited increased film study and early arrivals at the facility for his Week 15 dominance -- something he aims to sustain.\n\nBullen confirmed Carter's renewed commitment.\n\n\"He's been foot on the gas,\" Bullen said. \"He's even brought a couple teammates with him this week, too.\"\n\nThe coordinator highlighted the rookie's growth, noting that \"the production on the field was validation for the improvements and commitment he made to the process.\"\n\nAddressing rookie hurdles, Bullen preached experience above all -- something Carter gains each week.\n\n\"There's an element of it that the players have to experience it and feel that for themselves,\" he said. \"You don't know what you don't know.\"\n\nBullen credited Carter for responding positively to learning moments and leaning deeper into the process.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Giants' Charlie Bullen lauds Abdul Carter's breakthrough after benchings",

    "description": "Federal regulators will allow tech companies to effectively plug massive data centers directly into power plants, issuing a long-awaited order Thursday, as the Trump administration urges it to help the U.S. lead the world in artificial intelligence and revive domestic manufacturing.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's unanimous order is designed to clear up pressing issues around so-called “colocation” agreements in the nation's largest grid territory, which stretches across mid-Atlantic states to parts of Illinois and Indiana.

    "fullText": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Federal regulators will allow tech companies to effectively plug massive data centers directly into power plants, issuing a long-awaited order Thursday, as the Trump administration urges it to help the U.S. lead the world in artificial intelligence and revive domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's unanimous order is designed to clear up pressing issues around so-called “colocation” agreements in the nation's largest grid territory, which stretches across mid-Atlantic states to parts of Illinois and Indiana.\n\nBut it could become a blueprint for how FERC handles an October request from Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, to ensure that data centers and large manufacturers get the power they need as quickly as possible.\n\nIt also comes amid concerns that the mid-Atlantic territory covering some 65 million people will face electricity shortages in the coming years, as the build out of data centers outpaces the speed of new power sources coming online.\n\nLaura Swett, FERC’s chair, told Thursday's meeting that clearing the way for massive energy users — like data centers — to get electricity straight from power plants was a “critical step to give investors and consumers more certainty on how FERC believes we can solve the problem of meeting historic surging demand and realize our greatest potential as a country.”\n\nIt would, she said, also protect regular ratepayers, even as evidence mounts in various states that regular ratepayers are bearing the cost of new power plants and transmission lines to feed energy hungry data centers.\n\nPower plant owners applauded the step, as their share prices rose steeply in Thursday's trading. Advanced Energy United, whose members provide solar and wind power, said the FERC order should help clarify how big power users can set up their own power sources.\n\nThe Edison Electric Institute, which represents for-profit utilities, said only that it would “continue to work” to support rapid data center connection, protect ratepayers from cost-shifts and strengthen the grid for everyone.\n\nJeff Dennis, executive director of the Electricity Customer Alliance, said the order showed that FERC is trying to address looming issues around fast-growing power demand and underscored the urgency to reform grid policy.\n\nThursday's order grew out of a dispute between power plant owners and electric utilities over a proposed colocation deal between Amazon’s cloud-computing subsidiary and the owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.\n\nFor tech giants, such arrangements represent a quick fix to quickly get power while avoiding a potentially longer and more expensive process of hooking into a fraying electric grid that serves everyone else.\n\nBut utilities protested that it allows big power users to avoid paying them to maintain the grid. Some consumer advocates maintained that diverting energy from existing power plants to data centers could drive up energy prices without an answer for how rising power demand will be met for regular ratepayers.\n\nFERC's Thursday order sets up a couple new regulatory tracks.\n\nIt requires the operator of the mid-Atlantic grid, PJM Interconnection, to develop rates and conditions for different colocation scenarios involving new power plants or sources.\n\nThat could mean allowing a big power user to pay for only the transmission services they use, considerably less than they might otherwise pay to connect to the grid through a utility.\n\nThe order also could require a big power user that colocates with an existing power plant to pay the cost to replace the energy that it diverts away from the broader electric grid.\n\nFollow Marc Levy on X at https://x.com/timelywriter.",

    "description": "A doctor said powerlifting helped her boost her mood and energy while building muscle. She said two exercises can save you time in the gym.",
    "fullText": "When Dr. Shernan Holtan started lifting weights in 2013, she was mainly looking for a bit of me-time.\n\nHer career in bone marrow transplants — plus raising two kids — had left her with little room to take care of herself.\n\nAfter hiring a personal trainer, and was shocked at how much her energy and mood improved.\n\n\"All the energy you put in, you get back manyfold more through the metabolic and mental benefits of exercise,\" Holtan told Business Insider.\n\n\"As soon as I really realized what this was doing for me physically and mentally, I wanted to implement this for patients too.\"\n\nHer patients at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, New York receive stem cell treatments for conditions like leukemia — a grueling procedure that can require months of recovery time in a hospital.\n\nOnce they started following Holtan's personalized exercise plans, they recovered and returned home weeks earlier than expected, according to Roswell Park data.\n\nAs for Holtan, chief of blood and marrow transplant at the center, she is now a record-setting powerlifter, building her way up to an all-time best squat of 308.6 pounds, earning her the top national rank for her age group in 2019.\n\nNow at 49 years old, she can easily squat 225 pounds for reps, deadlift 250, bench 125, and run for miles without getting tired.\n\nShe said her favorite muscle-building exercises pay dividends for long-term health and offer an immediate boost to energy, confidence, and mood.\n\n\"I'm super happy to say at age almost 50, I can do all those things, and that means that I fear very little during any given week,\" she said. \"I know I can tackle these hard things and recover from them. So whatever challenge you have, send it my way.\"\n\nOn a typical day, Holtan hits the gym at about 5:30 a.m. to pump iron before work. Her routine varies, including a mix of strength training, CrossFit, and running for well-balanced fitness.\n\nWhen it comes to muscle and strength gains, \"squats and deadlifts are king,\" Holtan said.\n\nBoth movements are compound exercises, tapping into multiple muscle groups at once, including the core, back, and legs, to secure and stabilize your body and the weight as you move.\n\nTo get the most out of weightlifting and avoid injury, Holtan recommends starting small, with a weight you can handle and a number of reps that doesn't leave you exhausted. Then, build up a little at a time. That can make it easier to stick to a routine, rather than pushing too hard and feeling sore for a week (or more).\n\nFor patients recovering from treatment, Holtan gets them to begin with scaled exercises — doing squats without any added weights, or sitting back into a chair and standing up again until they have strength to do it without supportive equipment.\n\n\"Let's start with where you're at today. That's how you build without hurting yourself,\" she said. \"Major gains can be made over time with consistency.\"\n\nStrength training isn't just about building muscle; it can also help stave off early death, according to a growing body of research.\n\nHowever, it's only part of the equation — exercise that gets your heart pumping is crucial to prevent heart disease and lower the risk of heart attack and stroke, studies show.\n\nThat's why Holtan added running, hiking, and other cardio, like jump roping, to her routine.\n\nAs a result, she's lifting a bit less weight than when she trained for powerlifting alone, but can now easily run for five, six, or even seven miles (a feat she previously thought was unimaginable for her).\n\nChanging it up with new types of training also keeps exercise fun, and boosts her mood and energy, Holtan said, and the better longevity is a bonus.\n\n\"The main motivator, honestly, is I feel better today,\" Holtan said.\"Perhaps my rate of aging is slowing. Perhaps my risk of cancer is decreasing, perhaps my risk of other chronic diseases, including dementia, maybe that's decreasing too, and that's a nice benefit.\"",

The 1.4 gigawatt center would consume as much power as Detroit, and would help derail Michigan’s nation-leading transition to renewable energy.\n\nResponding to resident pressure, Saline Township’s board of trustees in September voted down the plans, but the data center’s powerful backers – including Donald Trump, Open AI’s Sam Altman, Oracle’s Larry Ellison, Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, utility giant DTE Energy, and Stephen Ross, the real-estate billionaire and Trump donor who owns Related Co – fought back.\n\nRelated Digital sued, and, vastly outgunned, the township board quickly folded and reversed its decision over strong resident objections. Now the project’s backers are trying to avoid minimal regulatory scrutiny on energy costs and pollution.\n\nThe controversy over the data center is representative of the David v Goliath fights playing out across the US, pitting working- and middle-class residents against the interests of billionaires and the political establishment.\n\n“This is part of an experience that America and the world is having around tech billionaires who are seizing power and widening the gap between those have much too much … and the working and middle classes,” said Yousef Rabhi, a former Democratic state legislative leader and clean energy advocate who opposes the plans.\n\n“That’s what these data centers are symbolic of, and they’re the vehicle for is the furtherance of this divide,” Rabhi added.\n\nThe proposal is part of the broader “Stargate” project composed of five data centers backed by the Trump administration, which granted $500bn in federal subsidies for them. It’s the largest project in Michigan history in terms of investment, and it also received subsidies on taxes that could have gone to roads and schools, among other uses, Rabhi said.\n\nThe plan’s supporters say the center would provide essential AI infrastructure, in part for national security, and create a few hundred jobs. Huge sums of money are at stake for the tech and utility companies.\n\nRoss’s Related Digital is the data center’s developer, while OpenAI, which produced ChatGPT, and Oracle will use the center to house its AI infrastructure.\n\nIn a statement, Related Digital alleged company the township’s decision violated zoning laws, and the spokesperson stressed the suit was filed jointly with three Saline Township property owners who are selling their property to Related.\n\n“Thankfully, we were able to reach a settlement agreement with the township to allow this project to move forward,” the spokesperson said. They noted Related is also making about $14m in donations to local causes.\n\nSaline Township is a small community of about 4,000 just outside Ann Arbor. The Stargate project is one of around a dozen data center proposals in Michigan over the last year that are strongly opposed at the local level. It’s one of four proposed near Ann Arbor – last week, plans for a second a few miles away in a neighboring town surfaced.\n\nSome municipalities have been successful in derailing plans, while others have lost the fight.\n\nIn Saline Township, former US marine Kate Haushalter and her husband are raising five children in a farmhouse next to the data center site. They bought and renovated the once-dilapidated home so they could live in a bucolic area, and Haushalter said she was not about to cede ground even though the township did.\n\n“Maybe because I was in the Marine Corps, but I would rather stay and fight,” Haushalter said. “I’m sure the chances are slim, but it’s worth fighting for, and I don’t want to teach my kids to roll over.”\n\nBig tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Open AI, which often own data centers, typically have enough political support at the state and federal levels that inexperienced local leaders who are comparatively poorly resourced are left on their own to defend their town from the centers.\n\nSaline Township supervisor Jim Marion conveyed that challenge when he told angry residents during a contentious November discussion that the township’s “hands were tied”.\n\n“This township doesn’t have the money to fight these big companies. You got to understand that,” Marion told the crowd. “We were dealt the cards we were dealt.”\n\nSome municipalities have utilized zoning laws to block the centers. Beyond that, there’s little local officials can do, and state and federal level regulations on the centers are virtually non-existent.\n\nStill, residents are growing more organized. A first protest on 1 December drew about 200 people, who Rabhi described as “truly a cross-section of American society”. The next week, 800 people participated in a state-level public input session, and organizers are pressuring state environmental regulators to hold up the project’s required wetland permits.\n\nAmong residents leading the pushback is Josh LeBaron, whose home sits about 500 yards from the site, where crews have broken down.\n\nHe characterized the project as “uniquely evil” because of the environmental risks, and because, he and others allege, the companies and government have been secretive about their plans. In response to questions about accusations of nimby-ism leveled against local residents by the project’s supporters, LeBaron said he would not be opposed to other developments.\n\nHe noted that Michigan is full of former industrial sites that would be more appropriate for the 575-acre property.\n\n“I would be at home reading a book if it were a subdivision,” LeBaron said.\n\nA Related spokesperson told the Guardian the company “explored sites across Michigan before deciding on this site, which is ideal as it’s a contiguous flat area”, and is set close to a major road and transmission lines.\n\nLocal opponents’ best hope for holding up the project lies in the arcane utility regulatory process on the massive amount of power the data center would require.\n\nDTE Energy claims the data center’s power demands and need for expensive new infrastructure will not increase residential electricity prices.\n\nBut it doesn’t want to show its math.\n\nDTE filed a petition with the Michigan Public Services Commission (MPSC), the state agency that regulates utilities, asking the MPSC to fast-track the plan’s approval. DTE’s request for an “ex parte” case requires limited scrutiny of its claim that the center won’t destroy the climate laws, or increase electricity bills.\n\nIn response, Michigan attorney general Dana Nessel and consumer advocacy groups filed a legal petition with the MPSC, calling for a “contested case” that would require much closer regulatory review of DTE’s claims.\n\nThe MPSC is helmed by Whitmer appointees, and the governor has strongly backed the project, raising suspicions among opponents that the agency will approve the ex parte request.\n\nStudies from across the country have shown data centers often increase rates, and DTE and regulators “cannot claim transparency while shutting the public out of the only process that requires DTE to support its claims with actual evidence”, said Bryan Smigielski, Michigan campaign organizer for the Sierra Club, which is intervening in the regulatory battle.\n\nIn a statement, a DTE spokesperson said: “To be clear, these data center customer contracts will NOT create a cost increase for our existing customers.”\n\nDTE has said the project won’t derail Michigan’s transition to clean energy, but state data and DTE’s plans suggest otherwise.\n\nMichigan, in late 2023, passed nation-leading climate laws that require utilities to transition to renewable energy by 2040. But the law included an “off-ramp” that allows utilities to continue running or building fossil fuel plants if renewable sources cannot handle the energy grid’s load.\n\nAt its peak, DTE’s grid already demands about 9.5 gigawatts of power, while the grid’s capacity is 11gw.\n\nIn July, DTE told investors it is in negotiations with big tech companies to provide 7gw of power for several proposed data centers.\n\nThe Saline center’s 1.4gw may not cause an exceedance of the 11gw threshold, especially because DTE is planning to build battery storage. But the Saline center along with any of the other proposed centers likely would trigger the off-ramp.\n\nDTE appears to be planning for that likelihood: DTE Energy executives said the company would likely need to build new gas plants to accommodate the data centers’ demand.\n\nHaushalter’s kids were born in the renovated farmhouse and are homeschooled there.\n\nShe and her husband try to teach the kids to respect nature. The family manages beehives, watches the geese and plant trees for wood to use in their wood-burning stove. At night, they take the kids outdoors for bonfires to look at the stars. “We’re not a big screen family,” Haushlater said.\n\nThe noise, light and air pollution is already disrupting the life the family built over 13 years. The center, if it is fully built, would fully destroy it, Haushalter said.\n\n“We are really passionate about nature and teaching our kids about it and I can’t believe the biggest construction project in Michigan is landing literally in my backyard, and there’s no recourse for the little guy,” she said. “It’s going to crush us.”",

    "description": "Louis Boyd-Madsen traces how a model of unregulated digital growth has outpaced energy planning in Ireland, and why it matters for the EU’s AI ambitions.",
    "fullText": "This reporting is published in collaboration with AlgorithmWatch and is supported by the European Digital Rights (EDRi), European Center for Non-For-Profit Law (ECNL), and Lighthouse Reports investigative journalism & civil society collaboration grants.\n\nIreland is now home to one of the highest concentrations of data centers in the world. What began as a quiet build-out of server farms around Dublin has expanded into an industrial presence with an ecological footprint that dominates the country’s electricity system. In the meanwhile, Big Tech has falsely portrayed itself as a partner in green transition.\n\nThe surge in energy consumption has reshaped the energy system around the needs of a handful of multinational tech companies. Grid capacity is being diverted to new hyperscale sites, transmission upgrades are being driven by their load, and the state is pouring billions into emergency fossil-fuel generators to keep supply stable. Households face higher bills, electrification plans have stalled, and national climate targets are slipping out of reach. What looks like a renewable success story on paper masks a system increasingly strained by a single, rapidly expanding sector of energy users.\n\nA growing social resistance has emerged in response. In nearby towns to Dublin, such as Rochfortbridge and Naas, local communities are pushing back against plans for new developments. At a national level, movements like “Energy for Who?” are demanding that renewables and grid connections be prioritized for essential social infrastructure, including housing and transport. Recent polling suggests this perspective is broadly shared by the public. Yet, government planning has so far focused on stabilizing digital growth, rather than reimagining how it fits within the goals of a just and affordable energy transition.\n\nIreland has thus become a test case for the political, economic, and environmental contradictions created by unregulated hyperscale expansion. As the EU moves to triple its data center capacity under the AI Continent Action Plan, the pressures already destabilizing Ireland’s grid offer a preview of what the continent may soon face.\n\nUnlike the hyperscale sites now being built across the globe amidst the frenzy of AI speculation, Ireland’s data center load growth was initially driven by more traditional uses: cloud storage, banking infrastructure, and the vast personal data archives that underpinned Big Tech’s earlier phase of expansion.\n\nSince the start of the post-war era, the Irish government has run an economic strategy based around courting investment from foreign multinationals – using a range of tools including tax incentives and infrastructure investment. This approach found real success with the rise of the ICT industry in the 1980s and 1990s, as US multinationals flooded into the country to lower their tax obligations and set up shop for export physical electronics, software, and services to the wider EU.\n\nAs money was channeled into a small set of tech giants in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, and the demand for computational capacity rose, Dublin began to see a steady growth in data centers – linking Big Tech’s offshore headquarters to the United States via a network of undersea internet cables.\n\nThe tech sector grew rapidly: Today, it has become a major source of government revenue and the main applicant for new electricity demand. Energy consumption by data centers is by far the highest in Europe: in comparison to the total Irish national consumption, they accounted for a 22% share in 2024. Roughly 97% of these data centers are clustered in the wider Dublin area. In 2023, 88% of all corporation tax was paid by foreign multinationals, of which 57% was paid by just 10 companies. A report from the Irish Central Bank suggests a major driver of growing tax revenue between 2011 and 2021 was “a small number of extremely profitable ICT firms.\"\n\nFor academic Patrick Brodie, this dependence is the latest chapter in a much longer development model. Ireland, he argues, “hitched its wagon to the transatlantic investment relationship” in the post-war period, shaping the country’s industrial and infrastructural landscape ever since. That bargain was never just about taxes. “It was also about building infrastructure,” he says, “and about managing the environmental contradictions that came with it.”\n\nThose contradictions are now concentrated directly in the electricity system, according to Brodie. Vast public resources are mobilized to serve capital-intensive digital infrastructure, even as shortages persist in housing, transport, and public services. “You can’t have a green transition that’s genuinely independent if it’s dictated by the needs of monopolistic tech companies,” he adds.\n\nThis facilitative model has already reappeared in different shades across Europe – from the UK’s AI Growth Zones, to Sweden’s energy tax break for data centers, or Denmark’s build-out of low-latency fiber optic and grid overcapacity. But nowhere has the potential bargain between digital growth and energy planning been pushed further than in Ireland. The consequences are now becoming visible across the country’s grid, climate trajectory, and public finances.\n\nThe Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) put an effective moratorium on new data center grid connections in Dublin, requiring new connections to be in unconstrained parts of the grid with sufficient local generation capacity. However, the grid remained fragile.\n\nIn response, the government and the energy system operator moved to commission emergency gas generators near the port of Dublin, the Irish Midlands, and a handful of additional sites, at an estimated cost of €1 billion. To help ease congestion, a wave of investment has been going into upgrading the grid’s capacity to distribute electricity. Much of this cost has been shouldered by Irish households, adding an average of roughly €100 per family to the bills in 2024.\n\nYet most of this newly created grid capacity was not used to electrify homes, rail, heat pumps, or industry. It was hoarded by data center developers. Ireland had limited rules governing priority access to grid connections, so hyperscalers simply booked capacity years in advance, effectively shutting out other users. For instance, a grid connection originally planned to serve new housing in Castlebaggot, West Dublin, was instead allocated to data centers.\n\nThe CRU suggested this trend was threatening the country’s broader targets for decarbonization and housing development: “The potential level of data center demand could significantly impact [the grid’s] ability to accommodate demand connections required to support Government policy targets such as 550,000 new homes by 2040, 680,000 heat pumps and 945,000 EVs [Electric Vehicles] by 2030, major electrified rail projects explicitly identified in the National Development Plan and other social infrastructure.”\n\nIreland is one of the most fossil fuel-reliant economies in Europe. “About 80% of all the energy we use today for our homes, our heating, our appliances, and our industry comes from fossil fuels,” says Paul Deane, senior lecturer in Clean Energy Futures at University College Cork.\n\nNevertheless, tech firms continued to portray themselves as green-transition partners — largely through Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (CPPAs). These allow companies to claim renewable electricity procurement on paper even when their facilities draw from the grid’s fossil-fuel-heavy mix in practice. Europe-wide, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are the three largest buyers.\n\nData from RE-Source suggests most CPPAs signed in Ireland are either financial – that is, not based on physical power delivery to the buyer – or structured in a way that has not been publicly disclosed. Only 14% are confirmed to involve a direct physical connection between the generator and the off-taker. The sources consulted for this investigation suggest the majority of these CPPAs match electricity on an annual basis rather than hour by hour.\n\nThe result is a widening gulf between corporate sustainability claims and actual, system-wide decarbonization.\n\nThese contradictions can be seen clearly in the Midlands where Bord na Móna’s planned Eco Energy Park will co-locate future Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centers with renewable-energy infrastructure. AWS is aiming to contract up to 800 MW of new wind and solar generation from Bord na Móna’s wider project pipeline — a volume of electricity roughly equivalent to the annual consumption of 2.2 million Irish homes. But so far, just 105 MW has been secured through a CPPA linking a proposed new AWS site to a nearby wind farm. Whenever the wind drops, any data centers built at the site will still draw power from the national grid, including fossil-fuel generated electricity.\n\nTo guarantee stability, Bord na Móna has already applied for a 600 MW gas plant adjacent to the site, which it claims will later switch to hydrogen or biomethane, according to the company’s environmental impact assessment report. No credible pathway exists to supply these fuels at this scale.\n\n“Renewable energy only helps meet our legally binding carbon budgets if it replaces fossil fuel demand, ” says Hannah Daly, Professor of Sustainable Energy at University College Cork. “If there was evidence that data centers were financing projects that wouldn’t otherwise have been built and that would match their demand at all hours of the year without creating bottlenecks for other renewables, they would at least not harm our carbon budgets.\"\n\nAnalysis conducted by AlgorithmWatch and Tech Policy Press, drawing on tech majors’ sustainability reports and press releases, suggests the total announced new capacity brought online via CPPAs with data centers in Ireland is far behind the pressure that data center expansion has already put on the energy system. Even if all announced CPPAs come online, they will still fall behind the load that has already been imposed on the system.\n\nIn a paper commissioned by FOE Ireland, Professor Daly found that half of the new capacity came from CPPAs, as opposed to government-run auctions, between 2020 and 2023. But this volume only amounted to 16% of the new data center demand during this period. Daly’s findings mirror our own. Despite industry claims of 100% renewable procurement, Ireland’s data centers in aggregate have seemingly deepened the country’s dependence on fossil fuels.\n\nYet regulators have limited power to intervene. Out of fear for the country’s energy security, the Irish government has promised to spend more on its fossil fuel infrastructure, beginning construction of a state-led strategic gas emergency reserve. The reserve will take the form of a floating LNG (liquefied natural gas) tanker and regasification plant, with an estimated upfront cost of between €300 and €900 million.\n\nMeanwhile, developers are increasingly turning to on-site gas generation to circumvent grid constraints entirely. Microsoft’s Grange Castle campus in Dublin has a fleet of gas generators totaling 239 MW. The site is one of seven with existing gas connections, five of which are currently actively consuming gas. Analysis by Hannah Daly from Cork’s University College suggests an additional four sites are awaiting connection and 22 have submitted planning requests.\n\nDaly shows that if existing, pending, and proposed gas-connected data center sites all operate at full capacity, they would emit up to 16.6 MtCO₂ per year — equivalent to 68% of Ireland’s total national emissions in 2023. She notes that Gas Network Ireland’s own, more conservative estimates, still predict an overshoot on sectoral emissions targets by 21-30%, driven by existing and confirmed on-site gas connections respectively.\n\nGas Networks Ireland and several private actors see this gas demand as a temporary, transitional problem as the network switches over to low-carbon hydrogen and bio-methane. Daly’s colleague Paul Deane remains sceptical. “Some data-center owners say they’ll only use gas for a few years, but there’s no convincing evidence of an off-ramp,” he says. “The promise of a technology in the future, isn't good enough to allow you to burn more natural gas today.”\n\nThese various interlinked problems have come to the fore in the discussions of the new Large Energy Users (LEU) Connection Policy. Expected to be finalized before the end of the year by the CRU, the policy will set out new rules for how data centers connect to the grid. The policy’s main goals are to improve grid stability, ensure sufficient on-site or nearby generation capacity, and strengthen emissions reporting.\n\nHowever, in the draft text, the CRU concedes that it will not receive enforcement powers to mandate renewable procurement, emissions caps, or set requirements for the decarbonization of the gas network.\n\nThe specialists interviewed said this reflects a broader pattern: rather than confronting the political trade-offs between digital growth and sustainability, the Irish government has deferred control to regulators tasked with managing that growth as smoothly as possible. The LEU policy, critics say, is the latest example of this deference to regulatory authority.\n\n“Ireland’s climate legislation directly conflicts with several of our enterprise strategies. There’s a lack of acceptance that it’s impossible to reconcile the constraints of carbon emission targets with what’s necessary for the growth of this industry via technological measures alone,” Daly says. “The right technologies and supply measures would need to be put in place ahead of the growth of the industry, not afterwards.”\n\nRosi Leonard, a data‑center campaigner for Friends of the Earth Ireland, argues that the government overestimates the sector’s mobility: companies are unlikely to abandon existing infrastructure in Ireland, even under stricter regulations, and any departure would indicate the need for broader economic diversification.\n\nThe Irish case has seen a consistent pattern: tech-sector growth is treated as inevitable, while climate obligations are accommodated around it. Managing the strained infrastructure comes at the cost of rising emissions and deferred decarbonization - a lesson that other countries facing rapid digital expansion will soon have to confront.\n\nIreland’s experience is no longer a local anomaly. The EU’s AI Continent Action Plan proposes tripling data center capacity by 2030 to support continent-wide AI deployment, cloud services, and high-performance computing. But the plan does not resolve the fundamental challenges that Ireland is now experiencing: scarce grid capacity, fossil fuel lock-in, insufficient transmission infrastructure, and potential social pressures caused by rising energy prices.\n\nThe EU also risks repeating one of Ireland’s biggest mistakes on renewable energy. Its plan to use public funds to de-risk long-term contracts for hyperscale data centers — through agreements linking governments, utilities and tech firms — could end up funneling taxpayers’ money into deals that let companies claim that they use renewable electricity without actually cutting emissions.\n\nEurope still has time to avoid these pitfalls. Countries planning to host hyperscale clusters should ensure sufficient energy capacity before data centers are built; block direct fossil-gas connections; enforce 24/7 renewable matching; and plan for the availability of clean power for critical public services and housing, rather than ring-fencing new renewables for the tech sector through CPPAs.\n\nThe Irish case shows what happens when digital expansion outruns energy planning, and when political dependency on a small group of firms overrides climate commitments. The costs - higher prices, deeper fossil lock-in, strained infrastructure, and derailed emissions targets - are now visible across the country, while access for homes, transport and essential infrastructure remains a low priority. The EU can treat Ireland as a cautionary tale, or repeat its mistakes on a continental scale.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge on Wednesday blocked Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 's attempt to shut down an aging oil pipeline running beneath a channel linking two of the Great Lakes, finding that only the federal government can regulate interstate pipeline safety.\n\nWhitmer, a Democrat, ordered regulators in 2020 to revoke an easement that allows Enbridge Inc. to operate a 4.5-mile (6.4) kilometer pipeline segment under the Straits of Mackinac, which link Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Whitmer made the move out of concern that the 72-year-old pipeline could rupture and cause a catastrophic spill.\n\nEnbridge filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block the revocation and the pipeline continues to operate. President Donald Trump's administration argued in filings this year that Whitmer's order interferes with U.S. foreign energy policy and that only the federal government, not the states, can regulate pipeline safety. The pipeline segment, known as Line 5, moves crude oil between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario.\n\nU.S. District Judge Robert Jonker wrote in an opinion that revoking the easement would effectively shut down Line 5. He found that Congress expressly prohibited states from regulating interstate pipeline safety in the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992. He also noted that the United States and Canada agree that Michigan's attempt to shut down the pipeline interferes with their federal foreign policy positions and trade relations.\n\n“An oil spill in Michigan's Great Lakes would undoubtedly be an environmental catastrophe. And Michigan would undoubtedly be the recipient of almost all the environmental damage that would result,” Jonker wrote. “But for better or worse, the national government has unequivocally decided to displace state power in this area and assume exclusive responsibility for interstate pipeline safety.”\n\nA message seeking comment was left for a spokesperson for Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, whose office represented Whitmer's administration in the lawsuit. A Whitmer spokesperson referred questions to Nessel.\n\nEnbridge issued a statement saying the line is safe and that Jonker's ruling protects both the United States and Canada from “significant energy disruptions.”\n\nMultiple other legal challenges are swirling around Line 5 in Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nNessel filed her own action in 2019 seeking to void the easement in the straits. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently weighing whether that case belongs in state or federal court. And a number of environmental groups and tribes have sued challenging state permits authorizing Enbridge's plan to build a protective tunnel around the straits segment. That case is pending before the Michigan state Supreme Court.\n\nIn Wisconsin, a federal judge ruled in 2023 that Enbridge must remove a section of Line 5 that runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa's reservation. The company has proposed a 41-mile (66-kilometer) route around the reservation, but the tribe and environmentalists say construction could harm the environment and the new route would still leave the region vulnerable to a spill.\n\nThe Bad River has sued in state court seeking to void state permits for the project; that case is still pending. The tribe along with a number of environmental groups also is challenging the permits through the state's contested case process, a proceeding similar to a lawsuit that will culminate with an administrative law judge's ruling.\n\nThe tribe filed a federal lawsuit on Tuesday in Washington, D.C., challenging U.S. Army Corps of Engineer permits authorizing the reroute.",

It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before,” Mr Trump declared on Tuesday.\n\nInsiders see the move as a creative new calculus aimed at starving Mr Maduro’s government, whose survival depends on selling crude oil abroad, while simultaneously forcing his allies in Moscow and Beijing to abandon him.\n\n“The White House is committed to the effort against the regime and seeing Maduro ousted,” a source close to the administration said.\n\nThis is the plan behind Mr Trump’s unprecedented blockade and the campaign the White House hopes rids Venezuela of its global influence.\n\nPerched in his presidential office in Miraflores Palace, Mr Maduro has relied on the export of Venezuela’s vast oil reserves to prop up his country.\n\nBeneath him lies more crude oil than Saudi Arabia, Russia or the United States and the mineral, dubbed “liquid gold”, accounts for about 88 per cent of Venezuela’s $24bn in exports.\n\nSince 2019, Mr Trump has sought to stop that.\n\nIn his first term, the US Treasury sanctioned Venezuela’s state oil company, PDVSA, and threatened secondary sanctions on any entity doing business with it.\n\nTo get around this, Mr Maduro’s government has turned to a clandestine “dark fleet” of tankers to evade sanctions and keep oil flowing to buyers in China, Russia and Cuba.\n\nHundreds of ageing tankers now smuggle sanctioned oil, acting as a financial lifeline to Caracas. As of late November, more than 30 of the 80 ships in Venezuelan waters or approaching the country were under US sanctions.\n\nIt is a growing phenomenon. Financial intelligence firm S&P Global estimates that one in five oil tankers worldwide are used to smuggle oil from sanctioned countries.\n\nThe tactic appears to be working. Despite international pressure, oil exports rose to some 921,000 barrels per day in November, the third-highest monthly average so far this year.\n\n“What they’re doing is essentially trying to cut off any remaining source of revenue for the government, to try to rattle the government into changing the regime,” said Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House.\n\nIndeed, oil tanker seizures are viewed by experts as the final act in Mr Trump’s chapter of maximum pressure that began with sanctions years before.\n\n“The revenue that is coming in from oil is something that the regime has long since used as a tool to buy influence within the military and maintain what little the government still is able to produce in the form of oil,” Andrés Martínez-Fernández, senior policy analyst for Latin America at the Allison Centre for National Security, explained.\n\n“It’s very quickly going to create instability to a new level within Venezuela and the regime.”\n\nRelations between Washington and Caracas are at a nadir. The US and many of its allies consider Mr Maduro, who is currently serving his disputed third term, as a dictator.\n\nYet thanks to the export of Venezuela’s oil, Mr Maduro has formed a network of loyal military commanders and international allies who keep his reign afloat.\n\nNone have become more important than China, which is the biggest buyer of Venezuelan oil, taking roughly 80 per cent of its exports. Every day it imports around 746,000 barrels of oil.\n\nBeijing has taken the oil not as a commercial import but as debt repayment towards an estimated $60bn in loans it has poured into Venezuelan oil projects.\n\nThe repayment deal suited both sides. Beijing secured oil while Maduro gained time and a friend on the international stage.\n\nThe blockade now threatens to derail the relationship and turn China against Mr Maduro as the ghost fleet of tankers stop arriving in Beijing’s ports.\n\nIf Venezuelan oil can no longer be delivered reliably, then Mr Maduro ceases to be an asset to China and becomes a legal liability as it chases repayment.\n\n“Once shipments stop arriving at foreign ports, the debts start getting called in. And that’s going to have an immediate impact. Things are going to start breaking down quickly, physical infrastructure, if these payments don’t start to come in,” Mr Martínez-Fernández explained.\n\n“It could get to a point where China says, ‘we would be better off being rid of this headache and being rid of Maduro, then by continuing any kind of active support.”\n\nBeijing has shown little sympathy to similar situations in the past. In Africa and Central Asia, the state has repeatedly distanced itself from leaders it no longer sees as reliable partners.\n\nFor Mr Trump, the blockade is another step in his plan dubbed the “Donroe Doctrine” by insiders, which aims to rid America’s backyard of Chinese influence.\n\nProject 2025, the Heritage Foundation doctrine long believed to be a blueprint for his second term, calls it “re-hemisphering”. It calls for the capture of supply chains in the region as a requirement of US economic security.\n\nIn that sense, the blockade is not aimed at confronting China head on but at making Mr Maduro persona non grata. If the oil-for-debt deal collapses, Beijing may consider switching horses and abandoning him.\n\nAlso in the crosshairs is Havana, which has long relied on subsidised Venezuelan oil.\n\nCuba, which has been the subject of its own US blockade, has been receiving some 24,000 barrels of crude, gasoline and jet fuel per day from the regime.\n\nMr Sabatini said the blockade will be “catastrophic” for Cuba, a historic enemy of the US, and estimates that exports will drop dramatically.\n\n“This is the moment that people like Marco Rubio [the secretary of state] and Cuban-American hardliners living in Florida have been waiting for,” he said.\n\n“They’re trying to starve the government. By doing that, then they actually starve the people too.”\n\nWhile China has poured millions into Venezuelan oil projects, Russia has been a key enabler in the shadows.\n\nA Russian-linked “dark fleet” of tankers have also helped Mr Maduro avoid sanctions by shipping his oil around the globe. However, Putin, who has sought to curry favour with Mr Trump since his return to the Oval Office, may redirect the vessels, further isolating Mr Maduro.\n\nIndeed, signs of Moscow’s shift in position are already there. Reports from late November suggested that Russia had initiated the evacuation of its citizens from the region.\n\nExperts agree that Mr Trump is attempting to squeeze Mr Maduro economically while testing the resolve of his few remaining allies in the hope they turn against him.\n\n“It does seem to be another way for the administration to ratchet up the pressure against the Maduro government,” said Brian Finucane, a former state department lawyer who is now senior adviser at the International Crisis Group.\n\nThe formation of the armada, the largest US military presence in the region in decades, began with a series of strikes on boats the Trump administration claimed were ferrying illegal narcotics to the US.\n\nFor months, American forces have launched lethal strikes on small vessels skimming through international waters under the banner of anti-drug operations.\n\nUS navy and coastguard units have destroyed around 20 boats since early September, killing over 90 people.\n\nEight warships, including three destroyers, three amphibious assault ships, a cruiser and a smaller littoral combat ship now make up the largest US military presence in the region in decades.\n\nThey are joined by a squadron of F-35B Lightning II jets and a handful of Reaper drones, which are capable of flying long distances and carrying up to eight laser-guided missiles. B-2 bombers have also been spotted flying off the coast.\n\nIt has led many Venezuelans, and many Americans, to believe that Mr Trump is preparing for war.\n\nThe blockade, insiders suggest, is one of the lesser military escalations the president had been weighing with his cabinet in recent weeks.\n\nInstead, they hope to turn the very cartels that military officials say are complicit in the smuggling of fentanyl to the US, against their leader by choking their cash flow, which is used to finance them.\n\nFor the armed forces, oil revenue is the glue that keeps the system intact. Generals control ports, customs and fuel distribution, making the military a pillar of Mr Maduro’s power.\n\nAs long as Mr Maduro can afford to pay his generals, their unfettered loyalty and in turn, his regime, will continue.\n\nThe same logic applies to Mr Maduro’s alleged relationship with organised crime. These groups rely on access to ports and laundering routes, all of which are sustained by the cash generated by oil sales.\n\n“It doesn’t take us yet to the place where we’re going into Venezuelan territory and conducting military strikes. We’re still talking about operations in international waters,” Mr Martínez-Fernández said.\n\nThe formation of the armada, coupled with Mr Trump’s continued threat of land strikes, have led experts to believe that the blockade is part of a slide towards conflict.\n\nTop military officials are said to have presented the US president with options for military intervention in the region which include land strikes. Other options reported to have been drawn up by the Pentagon include direct attacks on Mr Maduro’s security detail or operations to seize the country’s oil fields.\n\nIn each, Mr Trump is said to be against ideas that may place American troops at risk or could turn into an embarrassing failure.\n\nMr Trump and his cabinet have begun framing the blockade as a necessary intervention to reclaim “American oil”.\n\nSo what is stopping him? Perhaps his thirst for the Nobel Peace Prize and the potential blowback amongst his America First base if he started a war.\n\nWhat happens next will be determined by Mr Trump’s blockade. If oil flow continues, Mr Maduro survives.\n\nBut if it is stopped, China may decide the debt is not worth collecting and his cash-poor lieutenants may turn against him.\n\nThe gamble in Washington is simple; regimes do not fall when they are attacked but when they are abandoned.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

Some were ahead of their time, others were wonderfully weird, and a few were just plain misunderstood.\n\nAlright, time to check out these gems from the '70s that deserve more love from collectors.\n\nThe Gremlin gets mocked for its chopped-off rear end, but this little oddball was actually pretty clever. AMC created it by literally cutting down a Hornet to compete in the subcompact market, and it worked.\n\nWith optional V8 power, the Gremlin could surprise unsuspecting muscle cars at stoplights, and its quirky styling has aged into legitimate charm. You could get one with a 304 cubic inch V8 that made around 150 horsepower, which was respectable for the era.\n\nWhile collectors chase AMX models, clean Gremlins remain affordable and are starting to earn respect as honest, unpretentious American compacts.\n\nThe wedge-shaped TR7 was supposed to be Triumph's answer to modern sports car design, and while it had production issues, the driving experience was genuinely fun. Its \"wedge\" design was polarizing, earning the tagline \"The Shape of Things to Come,\" though reliability concerns overshadowed its decent handling.\n\nThe four-cylinder engine produced about 92 horsepower in North American spec, which sounds modest but kept the car nimble and engaging. Later TR8 models got a V8, but even the standard TR7 offers an accessible entry into British sports car ownership.\n\nThese days, you can find them for a fraction of what you'd pay for an MGB or Spitfire.\n\nBefore the 240Z became a collector darling, Datsun was building sensible sedans that happened to be incredibly well-engineered. The 710 was a reliable, practical sedan that competed with Toyota Corollas but somehow never achieved the same nostalgic status.\n\nIts 2.0-liter engine made around 94–97 horsepower (SAE net), depending on emissions spec and could reliably cruise all day without complaint. The wagon versions are particularly appealing today, offering classic lines and surprising cargo space.\n\nWhile collectors obsess over Z-cars, the humble 710 represents Datsun's commitment to quality without demanding classic car prices.\n\nSold through Mercury dealers, the Capri II was a captive import from Ford of Europe rather than a traditional American pony car. Built in Germany, it brought European hatchback styling and a more refined driving feel to the U.S. market at a time when domestic performance cars were shrinking.\n\nPower came from sensible options like the 2.3-liter four-cylinder or an optional 2.8-liter V6, prioritizing balance and fuel economy over straight-line speed.\n\nWhile it never tried to compete directly with muscle cars, the Capri II offered tidy handling, distinctive fastback styling, and a level of character that set it apart from its American contemporaries. Overshadowed by Mustangs and later fox-body Capris, the Capri II remains an overlooked slice of 1970s transatlantic automotive history.\n\nThis mid-engine, targa-topped Italian was designed by Bertone and offered sports car thrills in an affordable package. With just about 75 horsepower from its 1.5-liter engine, the X1/9 wasn't about straight-line speed but rather handling and driver engagement.\n\nThe mid-engine layout gave it phenomenal balance, making it a blast on twisty roads. Its removable roof panel predated the Miata's popularity by decades and offered open-air driving without sacrificing structural rigidity.\n\nWhile Fiat's rust reputation scared some buyers away, well-maintained examples prove that proper Italian sports cars don't need big price tags.\n\nThe Volaré replaced the beloved Valiant and initially suffered quality issues, but the platform itself was quite capable. Once Chrysler sorted out the early problems, these became solid, dependable cars with comfortable rides.\n\nYou could option them with everything from slant-six engines to 360 cubic inch V8s making around 160–170 horsepower (SAE net), depending on year/trim. The Road Runner package added some muscle car DNA to a practical body, creating an interesting sleeper.\n\nEarlier Mopars often get all the love, but clean examples represent affordable entry into Chrysler performance heritage.\n\nBefore Subaru became synonymous with crossovers, they built a compact pickup truck with rear-facing jump seats in the bed. The BRAT (Bi-drive Recreational All-terrain Transporter) cleverly avoided the chicken tax by including those seats, classifying it as a passenger vehicle.\n\nIts four-wheel drive system was ahead of its time for a small truck, and the about 67 horsepower from its flat-four engine was adequate for the lightweight body. The quirky design and practical utility made it perfect for outdoor enthusiasts.\n\nToday, rust-free BRATs are increasingly hard to find, but they remain much more affordable than vintage Toyota trucks.\n\nThe Alfetta brought Italian performance engineering to the sedan market with its unique transaxle layout for perfect weight distribution. Named after Alfa's successful racing cars, it featured a rear-mounted transmission that helped achieve 50/50 balance.\n\nThe four-cylinder engine produced around 109-130 PS but delivered smooth power and that distinctive Alfa character. Its handling was exceptional for a sedan, rewarding drivers who appreciated precise steering and responsive chassis dynamics.\n\nWhile collectors chase Spiders and GTVs, the Alfetta sedan offers genuine Alfa driving pleasure without the premium prices.\n\nThe Vega had serious quality issues at launch, but the GT version with its sport suspension and styling upgrades was actually entertaining to drive. Its aluminum-block four-cylinder was innovative if flawed, producing around 85 horsepower (SAE net) in typical mid-’70s GT spec (varies by year/engine option).\n\nThe lightweight body and decent handling made it competitive in autocross and club racing. Many enthusiasts have discovered that dropping in a small-block V8 turns the Vega into a genuine pocket rocket.\n\nSure, the reputation keeps values low, but that means more opportunity for builders and drivers who want an affordable project.\n\nFrench engineering excellence doesn't get enough credit in American collector circles, and the 504 proves that point beautifully. This sedan won European Car of the Year and featured independent suspension, comfortable seating, and surprisingly robust construction.\n\nThe fuel-injected four-cylinder made around 96 horsepower but delivered smooth, refined power delivery. Its ride quality was exceptional, combining European handling with comfortable long-distance cruising.\n\nWhile Citroëns get the quirky attention, the 504 represents practical French design that actually worked reliably in American conditions.\n\nBefore the RX-7 became a rotary icon, Mazda built the smaller RX-3 with the same spinning triangle magic. U.S.-market RX-3s used the larger 12A rotary, with published outputs closer to about 90 horsepower in North American spec; the engine’s willingness to rev was a big part of the appeal.\n\nRacing versions dominated their classes in IMSA competition, proving the chassis was more than just economical transportation. The coupe and wagon versions offer distinctive styling that stands out from typical Japanese offerings.\n\nCollectors focus on RX-7s and leave these earlier rotaries as affordable alternatives with genuine motorsport heritage.\n\nVolvo built a reputation on safety and practicality, but the 242 GT showed they understood driving dynamics too. This special edition featured unique aerodynamic bodywork, sport suspension, and distinctive alloy wheels.\n\nThe fuel-injected four-cylinder produced around produced about 123 hp in fuel-injected B21E form (outputs varied by market and rating standard) and delivered surprisingly spirited performance. Its handling was sharp for a Volvo, rewarding drivers who pushed it through corners.\n\nWhile 240-series cars are common, finding a genuine GT with its special equipment is increasingly difficult, yet they remain affordable compared to BMW 2002s.\n\nThese twelve overlooked machines from the 1970s prove that collector appeal isn't always about what's most expensive or most famous. Each offers something special, whether it's innovative engineering, quirky charm, or genuine driving pleasure that got overshadowed by flashier contemporaries. The best part about exploring these forgotten gems is that you can actually afford to buy one, drive it, and enjoy it without worrying about depreciation or astronomical restoration costs. As the collector car market continues evolving, smart enthusiasts are discovering that sometimes the most rewarding classics are the ones everyone else walked past.",

    "fullText": "Region struggling with drought now threatened by energy-hungry facilities – but some residents are fighting back\n\nThe sign outside Tom Hermes’s farmyard in Perkins Township in Ohio, a short drive south of the shores of Lake Erie, proudly claims that his family have farmed the land here since 1900. Today, he raises 130 head of cattle and grows corn, wheat, grass and soybeans on 1,200 acres of land.\n\nFor his family, his animals and wider business, water is life.\n\nSo when, in May 2024, the Texas-based Aligned Data Centers broke ground on its NEO-01, four-building, 200,000 sq ft data center on a brownfield site that abuts farmland that Hermes rents, he was concerned.\n\n“We have city water here. That’s going to reduce the pressure if they are sucking all the water,” he says of the data center.\n\n“They’re not good, I know that.”\n\nTwo years ago, the company said it would invest about $202m on a “hyperscale” data center that would employ 18 people and dozens \n\nAll the while, a 10-minute drive north, the shoreline of Lake Erie hasn’t been this low in years.\n\nWater levels across all five Great Lakes have begun to drop in recent months as part of a long-term fall. Since 2019, the Great Lakes have seen water-level decreases of two to four feet. While experts say this is a natural decrease given the record highs the lakes have experienced since 2020, it’s happening at a time when a huge new consumer of water has appeared on the horizon: data centers.\n\nThe source of the largest single deposit of freshwater on the planet, the Great Lakes, in particular Lake Erie, are already struggling with the fallout of drought and warmer water temperatures that, at this time of year, fuel major lake-effect snowstorms, and greater than normal levels of evaporation due to the absence of ice cover.\n\nWith major cities such as Chicago, Toronto, Detroit and Pittsburgh all within a few hundred miles of each other, small, under-resourced communities around the Great Lakes have become hugely attractive for data-center companies.\n\nIn Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, Microsoft is building what it calls the “world’s most-powerful AI data center” that is set to open early next year and expected to use up to 8.4bn gallons of municipal water from the city of Racine every year. Racine gets its water from Lake Michigan. Similar stories are playing out in Hobart, Indiana, where AWS is planning to build a data center two miles from Lake Michigan’s shoreline, and in Port Washington, Wisconsin.\n\nIn Benton Harbor, Michigan, locals are concerned that a proposed $3bn data center would contribute to environmental pollution and traffic.\n\nForty miles west of Aligned’s under-construction data center in Ohio, in Woodville Township, hundreds of people showed up to a public meeting last October to voice concern about another proposed data center project in their rural community.\n\n“The Great Lakes region, especially in states such as Illinois and Ohio, [is] among the most data-center dense states in the region. In addition to the high volumes of water used on site for cooling, our recent research found that even more water may be consumed to generate electricity to power data centers’ energy needs,” says Kirsten James, senior program director for water at Ceres, a nonprofit headquartered in Boston.\n\n“These impacts can conflict with communities’ water-resource planning efforts.”\n\nThe Great Lakes Compact, a 2005 accord signed by the governors of eight US states and two Canadian provinces, means that Great Lakes Water must only be used within the regional basin.\n\nResearch by Purdue University found that data centers on average consume about 300,000 gallons of water a day. Water used by data centers is warmed significantly and for those that do not use a closed loop system, that heated effluent water, just 20% of the initial amount, is often discharged back into local wastewater systems or the environment, with potentially serious consequences for flora, fauna and human consumers. Even closed-loop systems that reuse the same water repeatedly need millions of gallons of water.\n\nWhile many new data centers are drawing water from local municipalities that, in turn, get their water from groundwater, much of that supply comes from the Great Lakes watersheds.\n\nSome communities are fighting back. Last month, residents of Fife Lake, Michigan, were overjoyed after hearing a plan for a data center in their town of 471 residents would be scrapped due to local opposition.\n\nSimilar stories of successful opposition have played out in Indiana and elsewhere.\n\nBut the data centers are fighting back.\n\nPrivate firms representing data center companies have often successfully sued community authorities, accusing them of illegally excluding certain types of developments, making small towns powerless in the battle to keep out giant water-guzzling corporations.\n\nIn Michigan’s Saline Township, a community of about 400 people outside Ann Arbor, OpenAI and Oracle used a representative company to successfully sue the local authority to overcome opposition and build a massive facility that would use 1.4 gigawatts of electricity – roughly the equivalent of powering 1.4 million homes.\n\nThe Detroit Free Press editorial board assailed the move, calling it a “a fait accompli, hammered into this tiny Washtenaw county community over the objections of residents, the elected board that represents them, and Michigan’s attorney general, absent expert or outside testimony save a cursory public hearing held over Microsoft Teams”.\n\nData companies and their backers, however, say their presence is a net gain for Great Lakes communities by providing jobs and investment over the course of years.\n\nAligned has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to Perkins Township, the local school system and a career center. In return, it gets a 15-year tax exemption from local authorities. A representative declined to respond to questions from the Guardian asking how much water it intends to use at the data center and from where it originates.\n\nLocal municipalities that support these facilities claim that the data centers will increase tax revenue and help rebuild ageing infrastructure such as water delivery systems that, in some places, are in significant need of upgrading. Calls, emails and messages left with Erie county commissioners asking if local authorities plan to supply the Perkins Township data center with water were not responded to.\n\nSome Perkins Township residents say a number of local companies have been hired during the construction phase, bringing work to the area.\n\nBut many argue those investments are not worth the long-term price the community may pay.\n\nAmanda Voegle, who works at a heating business now directly facing the data center, is concerned about water and many other issues.\n\n“A couple of years ago, there was a water pollution issue at the site. I’m very concerned. Is this [water] going back into the lake?”\n\nTwo years ago, the construction site upon which the data center is being built was found to be the source of contamination of a river that flows into Lake Erie, with the remediation company responsible cited by the Ohio EPA for unauthorized discharges into state waters.\n\n“I don’t understand why they built it so close to the street, because it’s an eyesore,” says Voegle.\n\nShe says there have been other unusual incidents at her workplace recently, including power surges.\n\n“I don’t know if it’s related [to the data center]. It’s probably almost weekly that we lose power and have to fully reboot everything. There was a couple of things we actually had to replace because [the power surge] fried it.”",

    "description": "Archer, Beta, and Joby are developing autonomous, gas-electric hybrid air taxis in hopes of clinching defense contracts.",
    "fullText": "US tech companies are hoping soon to gain clearance for flying taxis that make short commercial hops like Manhattan to LaGuardia Airport. Eyeing defense dollars, they're also equipping air taxies for the battlefield.\n\nAir taxis have wings and propellers, allowing them to take off and land like a helicopter and fly like an airplane. You can't yet hail a flying taxi anywhere in the US, though those futuristic flights could be coming in the next couple of years.\n\nPentagon leaders have shifted their focus to the tech industry, arguing that traditional defense contractors can't deliver new weapons fast or cheaply enough to meet today's fast-changing global threats. The Pentagon has pledged to pour billions of dollars into new technology and has issued requests for information on hybrid, autonomous air taxis, also known as vertical takeoff and landing vehicles, or VTOLs.\n\nFlying-taxi makers including Archer Aviation, Joby Aviation, and Beta Technologies say that gas-electric hybrid vehicles reminiscent of \"The Jetsons\" could carry military cargo more cheaply and quietly than helicopters. Some of the designs under development for the battlefield incorporate autonomous technology that could detect and avoid threats. The aircraft could be used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, or moving supplies and equipment, these companies say.\n\nAmerican air-taxi makers are racing to develop cutting-edge technology as Chinese companies like EHang do the same. The VTOL industry is still young, and China hasn't yet cornered the air-taxi market as it has for smaller, aerial combat drones.\n\n\"When we can fundamentally go further and faster than a helicopter, then we have a tool that's more powerful than what the Chinese are going to bring to the fight,\" said Beta's CEO, Kyle Clark.\n\nCommercial air-taxi designs are typically electric. Swapping the electric battery for a hybrid engine will help the aircraft carry more weight and travel farther, a key consideration for the Pentagon, executives from Joby and Beta told Business Insider.\n\nArcher, Joby, and Beta are all developing military VTOLs that can fly autonomously. In Beta's battlefield version, a human must plug in destination coordinates for the aircraft, and artificial intelligence can help it navigate to the destination, said Clark. Configuring the aircraft to operate without a pilot makes it lighter than a commercial air taxi, since it doesn't require seats or the safety and avionics systems that are necessary when transporting people, Clark added.\n\nClinching coveted contracts from the Pentagon would add air-taxi manufacturers to a growing list of dual-use companies that sell to commercial clients as well as to the government. Joby is collaborating with traditional defense firm L3Harris on a military VTOL and test-flew a prototype in November. Archer is developing one with Anduril Industries for the US, according to Archer's CEO, Adam Goldstein. Anduril is also developing a military VTOL called Omen in a joint venture with Emirati defense giant Edge Group.\n\nOne of the air-taxi makers' biggest hurdles to commercial adoption is securing Federal Aviation Administration certification, though the Trump administration is attempting to make it easier. In September, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced an FAA program that permits VTOL companies to test-fly piloted and unmanned aircraft before receiving federal certification.\n\nJoby is leading the pack in the certification race, having cleared four of the five stages for commercial clearance. Archer and Joby hope to fly commercially as early as 2026.\n\nFor defense adoption in the US, the companies would need the Defense Department to deem their VTOLs ready to fly, Goldstein said.\n\nTaylor Rains contributed to this story.",

A statement said they own or manage shadow fleet tankers under sanctions and which transport oil “while practicing irregular and high-risk shipping practices.”\n\nThe sanctions, which were agreed at a meeting of the 27-nation bloc's foreign ministers in Brussels, involve mostly asset freezes and travel bans.\n\nThe EU move adds to growing pressure on the shadow fleet. Last month, Ukraine used domestically produced Sea Baby naval drones to strike two more Russian oil tankers in the Black Sea. Both were under international sanctions.\n\nSeparately, the bloc imposed sanctions on members of Russia’s military intelligence agency, GRU, and a hacking group known as Cadet Blizzard, accusing them of cyber attacks targeting Ukraine, the EU and unnamed NATO allies.\n\nThe EU also added a number of foreign policy analysts and influencers accused of promoting pro-Russian propaganda or conspiracy theories to its sanctions list.",

Venezuela's government ‍regularly blames problems like blackouts on conspirators from the opposition and foreign entities like the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, without giving evidence.\n\nSources said the effects were ongoing.\n\n\"There's no delivery (of cargoes), all systems are down,\" one company source said.\n\nOil output, refining and domestic distribution were not affected, the sources said, but ​the company on Monday failed to restart administrative systems, forcing workers to keep written records of operations.\n\nTwo other sources said PDVSA ordered ‌administrative and operational workers to disconnect from the company's systems and to limit access of indirect workers to PDVSA's facilities.\n\nLast week's VLCC seizure was the first interception of a tanker or cargo coming from Venezuela, which has been under U.S. sanctions since 2019, and a sign of growing pressure on President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nThe seizure has already led to a sharp fall in Venezuelan oil exports, also hitting crisis-stricken Cuba, which is facing daily power cuts.\n\nMore than 11 million barrels of oil are stuck on board other vessels in Venezuelan ⁠waters since last week. Among the few vessels setting sail are the ​ones chartered by U.S. oil firm Chevron, one of PDVSA's key partners, which continue ​departing under an authorization previously granted by Washington, according to shipping data.\n\nA tanker carrying Russian naphtha for PDVSA and at least four supertankers due to pick up crude cargoes in Venezuela have made u-turns, ship monitoring data ‍showed on Monday.\n\nBenin-flagged tanker Boltaris, which ⁠was carrying some 300,000 barrels of Russian naphtha bound for Venezuela, made a u-turn late last week and is now heading for Europe without having discharged, according to LSEG vessel monitoring data.\n\nAt least four VLCCs that were in PDVSA's schedules to ⁠load crude at Venezuelan ports in the coming weeks have also made u-turns in recent days, monitoring service TankerTrackers.com said.\n\nVenezuela's crude output averaged 1.17 million barrels per ‌day last month according to official figures, while oil exports rose to some 952,000 bpd, according to shipping data.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Reuters; editing by Julia Symmes-Cobb, Nathan Crooks and Nia Williams)",

    "fullText": "Don't say bah humbug to applying to jobs during the holiday season.\n\nIt's easy to feel like a Scrooge about the job market these days. At this point, you might think you'll need a Christmas miracle to get hired in the waning moments of 2025.\n\nBut unlike Santa Claus, your chances of getting hired in December are real, writes BI's Sarah E. Needleman.\n\nI don't mean to be a Grinch by telling you to spend your holidays applying for jobs. I get the feeling of wanting to shut it down for the year and give it a go in 2026. After all, it's been a brutal year for job seekers.\n\nBut recruiters and hiring managers told Sarah they're not slowing down, so neither should you. In some cases, they need to rush through hirings or risk losing any remaining budget for the year.\n\nAlso, what's the alternative? Wait until the New Year? That just means even more competition as people reevaluate their jobs after bonus season. There's also the risk of another wave of layoffs to kick off the new year, which will increase the candidate pool.\n\nSo set aside the eggnog for a bit and keep plugging away on those applications. Take it from me, it can happen.\n\nMy Business Insider work anniversary? December 10.\n\nJob hunting isn't the only thing you shouldn't hold off on until the New Year.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a cringey LinkedIn influencer, the best time to do something is yesterday; the second-best time is now.\n\nHere are three other things you can check off your to-do list before midnight on December 31:\n\nA new home for the holidays. The holidays can be a great time to go home shopping. In fact, according to one real-estate investor and agent, you could get a better deal. A few days before Christmas is her favorite time to submit an offer because the seller could be distracted or keen to wrap things up before year's end.\n\nInvest then rest. If you're investing for the long haul — which, let's be honest, is the only way you should be investing — the end of the year could be a good time to dive in. Certain investment vehicles, like IRAs, have limits on yearly contributions, meaning you can load up before starting fresh next month.\n\nSilver (dumb)bells. Gyms in January are a mess. Front-run the New Year's resolution crowd and start getting your workouts in now. The last few weeks of December are my favorite: It's mostly empty, and the people there are the gym rats who are always the friendliest. Get a lay of the land before people start doing curls in the squat rack on January 2.",

    "fullText": "Ukraine has hit Russian oil platforms in the Caspian Sea with long-range drones three times in a matter of days, a security source told Business Insider on Monday.\n\nIn the most recent attack, drones struck a platform at the Korchagin oil and gas condensate field, causing damage at the facility and forcing it to halt production, said the source in the Security Service of Ukraine, who was only authorized to speak anonymously to discuss sensitive military developments.\n\nThe drone attack is the latest against Russia's energy sector, a critical source of income for Moscow that helps fuel its war efforts in Ukraine. Kyiv has ramped up its deep-strike campaign on key oil and gas facilities and is now targeting infrastructure in the Caspian Sea, hitting activities there for the third time in less than a week.\n\nThe source in the SBU, Ukraine's main internal security agency, said that drones struck the Filanovsky oil production platform last Thursday, marking the first time Kyiv had caused damage to Russian oil infrastructure in the Caspian Sea.\n\nThe following day, Ukrainian drones struck the Filanovsky platform again and also hit the Korchagin platform. The SBU source said that the attacks caused damage at both facilities and forced a suspension of operations.\n\nThe platforms are owned by Lukoil-Nizhnevolzhskneft, a subsidiary of the Russian energy giant Lukoil. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the drone attacks. Additionally, neither Russia's defense ministry nor its US embassy responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe SBU source said that the agency is working to deny Russia the critical revenue from its energy sector, which helps finance the war in Ukraine. They said that the Filanovsky deposit is one of Russia's largest, with an estimated 129 million tons of oil.\n\n\"No Russian object working for the war is safe regardless of its location,\" the source said, according to a translation of their remarks shared with Business Insider.\n\nThe repeated targeting of the two Caspian Sea oil platforms appears to signal a new shift for Ukraine as it continues to strike Russian oil and gas infrastructure.\n\nFor months, Ukraine has mostly carried out attacks against oil refineries, ports, and other facilities across Russia. However, in recent weeks, Kyiv has expanded these operations beyond land and intensified its strikes on maritime targets.\n\nJust before the three strikes in the Caspian Sea, Ukraine used its naval drones packed with explosives to attack three tankers allegedly belonging to the Russian \"shadow fleet,\" a collection of hundreds of vessels that Moscow uses to move oil and circumvent sanctions on its energy exports.\n\nUkrainian officials have described the campaign against the Russian energy sector as \"long-range\" sanctions. The deep-strike campaign has been a bright spot for Kyiv in this war as Moscow's forces continue to make slow but costly gains on the battlefield.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine has repeatedly urged its international partners to do more to prevent Russia from exporting oil and earning cash to fuel its invasion.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The volume of Venezuelan oil already headed to China before the U.S. seized a Venezuelan tanker last week, plus a glut of crude in storage and weak demand, will limit ​the near-term impact of the move in the Chinese market, traders and analysts said.\n\nExports from the South American producer have ‌fallen sharply since the U.S. seized a tanker off Venezuela's coast and imposed new sanctions on shipping firms and vessels doing business with it, with the prospect of further ‌seizures deterring shipments.\n\nChina, the world's no. 1 oil importer, is the biggest buyer of Venezuelan crude, though Venezuelan supply accounts for only around 4% of its total crude imports.\n\nVenezuelan oil arrivals to China are on track to rise this month and next, traders and analysts say, thanks to a spate of exports over the previous four months, deepening discounts on crude that can take up to 60 days to reach the independent refiners ⁠that are its main buyers.\n\n\"The surge in Venezuela ‌flow to China increased in anticipation of sanctions,\" said Mukesh Sahdev, founder & CEO of energy consultancy XAnalysts. He predicted that the impact of the tanker seizure, and any additional sanctions or seizures, would be seen in ‍February.\n\nDecember China arrivals of Merey crude, Venezuela's main export grade, are expected to exceed 600,000 barrels per day, according to analysts at tanker tracker Vortexa. Kpler puts December Merey arrivals at 664,000 bpd, subject to revision, which it said would be a record.\n\nMOUNTING VOLUMES OF OIL IN FLOATING STORAGE\n\nThe Venezuelan supply comes ​on top of ample deliveries from other sanctioned producers Russia and Iran, which have led to mounting volumes of oil in floating ‌storage in Asia.\n\nAsian floating oil storage hit 71 million barrels last week, rising from 53 million barrels at end-October and about 33 million barrels in early September, Kpler data showed, adding to pressure that had deepened discounts on Venezuelan crude.\n\nAt least one-third of the estimated 650,000 bpd of Merey discharged in November in China is still looking for end-buyers, said Vortexa analyst Emma Li.\n\nTwo trade sources said plentiful Russian and Iranian supply, along with barrels on the way to China from Venezuela, had limited market worries for now.\n\nAnother trading manager at a regular ⁠buyer said it would take time to gauge the impact of the seizure ​on supplies, but that his company had shifted to buying \"small amounts\" of Canadian TMX ​crude to hedge against geopolitical risk.",

The shift signals concern too much crude is being offered in the Middle East than can readily be bought by refiners in Asia at a time of higher, competing worldwide output.",

    "fullText": "A 1,000-strong \"dark fleet\" of rogue oil tankers skirting sanctions has emerged as a new target for the U.S. and Ukraine, a senior maritime intelligence analyst claims.\n\nMichelle Wiese Bockmann warned the aging fleet poses geopolitical risks and threats of $1 billion oil spills, with the recent U.S. seizures in Venezuela and Ukrainian drone strikes in the Black Sea marking a turning point for both nations in their efforts.\n\n\"There are about 1,000 vessels worldwide that are trading sanctioned crude tankers containing sanctioned Iranian, Venezuelan and Russian oil,\" Bockmann told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"These vessels are a lifeline for these regimes, because they’re used for shipping oil to fund the war in Ukraine, and also give money to the illicit Maduro regime,\" she added.\n\nIran Backs Maduro To Keep Latin America Foothold As Trump Increases Pressure On Venezuela\n\n\"This is a brand-new problem for the U.S., and now Ukraine has signaled they are going to target these vessels the same way,\" she said. \"There is a new strategy to deal with this dark fleet, which is the lifeline of sanctioned oil revenues, and now under attack by the U.S. and Ukraine. The strategy is all to counter what we call gray-zone aggression.\"\n\nUs Escalation With Maduro Halts Deportation Flights To Venezuela\n\nRecent Ukrainian naval drone strikes have disabled several tankers in the Black Sea, including the Dashan, part of Russia’s so-called shadow fleet that Ukraine says helps Moscow export oil in defiance of sanctions, according to Reuters.\n\n\"It is dangerous and could be interpreted as a form of gray-zone aggression in order to continue to keep oil revenue flowing,\" Bockmann said.\n\n\"This is all a billion-dollar oil spill catastrophe waiting to happen,\" she added, pointing to the environmental and navigational risks posed by poorly maintained, uninsured ships.\n\nVenezuela Mobilizes Troops, Weapons In Response To Us Warship Buildup In Caribbean\n\nShe said a subset of \"about 350 to 400 vessels at any one time are not only sanctioned but falsely flying flags, which is dangerous,\" because false registration leaves vessels stateless and uninsured, putting crews at risk.\n\n\"This is a huge issue for maritime safety, it’s a menace to the environment, and it entails crew welfare,\" Bockmann said.\n\nThese vessels, she said, are typically \"elderly\" and used solely for sanctioned oil trades. Many also \"manipulate AIS\" to show they are in one place when they are actually elsewhere.\n\nTrump Sends World's Most Powerful Warship To Latin America — Historic Echoes Of Regime Change\n\n\"They use false flagging, but also spoofing and manipulating its AIS to show it's in one place when it's not. These vessels have also gone to fraudulent registries that don't exist, which means they have no insurance,\" she said. \"Their certificates of seaworthiness are invalid, and they have relied on international maritime conventions to have what's called the ‘right of innocent passage’ so they can't get intercepted.\"\n\nBockmann said U.S. forces have used legal tools including Article 110 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which allows boarding of stateless vessels, to stop these ships.\n\n\"It's my belief that they used Article 110, and they got on board that vessel, and they were absolutely entitled to remove that vessel from global trade,\" she said.\n\nVenezuela Accuses Us Of 'Piracy' After Seizing Massive Oil Tanker\n\nIn the Caribbean, U.S. forces recently seized the tanker Skipper, sanctioned in 2022 and found to be masking its location, under a federal warrant as part of a broader campaign to disrupt illicit oil shipping.\n\n\"The recent Venezuelan tanker was carrying 1.8 million barrels of oil uninsured, so that's a billion-dollar maritime disaster waiting to happen,\" Bockmann said.\n\nAs reported by Fox News Digital, Dec. 12 saw Attorney General Pam Bondi frame the U.S. seizure of a Venezuelan crude tanker as a sanctions-enforcement action rooted in a federal court warrant.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Black Sea, Ukraine targeted multiple alleged \"shadow fleet\" tankers with sea drones, according to Reuters.\n\n\"The three tankers that have been targeted by Ukraine are all in ballast, which means that they weren't carrying oil,\" Bockmann said.\n\n\"That was carefully chosen, and they were also falsely flagged, just like in the recent case of the three tankers attacked in Ukraine. That flag was Gambia. In the U.S. case of Skipper, the flag was Guyana,\" Bockmann said.\n\nFox News Digital's Morgan Phillips contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article",

    "description": "Snacking on junk food can disrupt your diet even if you eat healthy meals. A nutritionist recommends her favorite healthy snacks for lasting energy.",
    "fullText": "Eating more snacks can make it easier to stay on track with a healthy diet, according to a top nutritionist — if you pick the right kind of snacks.\n\nResearcher Federica Amati said smart snacking has been a game-changer for her personal eating habits on a busy schedule.\n\n\"If I've got a really busy day, sometimes I don't get time to have a proper lunch. If I have these snacks with me, I'm good and I'm feeling good. If I don't, then I'm ravenous later,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nAmati, medical scientist and head nutritionist at the nutrition app ZOE, has also seen the power of snacking first-hand in her work.\n\nEven if you're careful with most of your diet, snacking on junk food can leave you struggling with metabolic health issues like weight gain, low energy, high cholesterol and high blood sugar, she said. That's backed up by research from ZOE and other experts.\n\n\"Crappy snacks can basically outdo a lot of the greatness you are doing for yourself with good food,\" Amati said. \"Snacking per se isn't good or bad for you, but what you snack on has a massive influence on your metabolic health.\"\n\nShe shared the two foods she always carries for a nutrient-dense boost, and how to optimize your snacking routine for a healthier diet.\n\nAmati's go-to snack combination at work is an apple and a small jar of mixed nuts.\n\nThe pairing of fruit and nuts offers gut-healthy fiber, plant-based protein, and healthy fats — all satiating nutrients that tell your brain you're full.\n\n\"It doesn't have to be some sort of chef situation,\" Amati said.\"It's just about having a very different mentality to snacking. If you are hungry, eat something that's a food.\"\n\nWhat's key is that you reach for whole foods. If you snack on ultra-processed foods, like a granola bar loaded with additives like sugar, fat, and salt, it's easy to overeat.\n\nWhy? Because the nutrients in ultra-processed foods are already broken down, leaving you with less to digest. So, they offer a temporary energy fix but leave you crashing afterward, often leading to overindulgence at your next meal or snack.\n\n\"It's nutritionally pretty void. So though you may temporarily not be so ravenous, your body's not benefiting from it, and your hunger will remain later that day,\" Amati said.\n\nPlus, the benefit of Amati's fruit-and-nuts snack is that it's relatively inexpensive and requires zero prep: just grab and go.\n\nThe specifics aren't crucial — you can make a healthy snack from fruits like berries and other nuts and seeds, from almonds to pepitas.\n\nWhatever you choose to snack on, being proactive about your hunger cues can lead to better results, according to Amati.\n\nEating early helps you stay in tune with your circadian rhythm to feel consistently energized and make better choices throughout the day.\n\n\"We're primed to more efficiently deal with nutrients and with energy storage and distribution from fats or sugars at the beginning of the day,\" she said.\n\nSkimping on early meals and snacks can leave you so hungry by dinner that you double-down on dessert or late-night snacking, often with less-healthy choices.\n\nWhile timing your snacks can be a matter of personal preference, eating when you're hungry but not hangry can stave off temptations for a more balanced diet.\n\n\"You'd be surprised how many people who struggle with their weight or who struggle with poor metabolic health don't eat enough during the day,\" Amati said.",

    "fullText": "San Antonio police are warning residents to be alert when withdrawing large sums of money after more than 200 reported cases this year of \"jugging.\"\n\nIt's a crime in which suspects follow someone from a bank or ATM who has just withdrawn money and steal their cash at the first opportunity, often in a violent smash and grab.\n\nPolice shared footage of a jugging incident caught on camera involving a man who withdrew a large amount of money from an ATM and left it on the passenger seat of his vehicle before stopping to pump gas.\n\nInvestigators say suspects in a stolen car tailed the victim from the ATM to the gas station, circled his vehicle twice and then broke in, taking the cash.\n\nDetective Nathan Zachary said the pattern is simple: someone leaves a bank with money in hand, a soon-to-be thief sees this, follows them and quickly snatches the cash - either from the vehicle or directly from the victim.\n\nHe said jugging cases have been reported across the city, including one case in which someone was followed starting at the Ingram Road and Loop 410 area, all the way out to Boerne.\n\nIt's a rising crime that San Antonio police have been focusing in on this year.\n\nZachary advises people to \"check your tail\" when leaving a bank or ATM.\n\n\"If they stop when you stop and when you go somewhere else you see that car, they're probably waiting to steal money from you,\" he said.\n\nHe also recommends concealing bank envelopes or withdrawing cash discreetly so suspects don't see how much you're carrying.\n\nPolice stressed that jugging isn't tied to a specific neighborhood and urged anyone handling large sums of cash to remain aware of their surroundings and avoid leaving money visible inside a vehicle.\n\nThis article originally published at WATCH: San Antonio police share footage of jugging caught at gas station.",

    "fullText": "College football has always been an expansive and complex entity and it has shifted even further in that direction in recent years with the introduction of NIL deals and the expansion of the transfer portal. Oddly enough, it is those same alterations that play a part in the Oregon Ducks becoming such an attractive destination.\n\nThey landed five-star wide receiver Dakorien Moore last recruiting cycle and he has been everything that the school and scouts hoped he would be. He is dealing with a knee injury currently, but he had recorded 443 yards and three touchdowns in just eight games before his stellar season was disrupted.\n\nMoore has been so impressive that reports surfaced yesterday that he is signing an NIL deal with Red Bull, an energy drink manufacturer. No details have emerged about how much it is worth, but the true freshman wideout added yet another partnership to an already strong package of NIL contracts.\n\nNEW: Oregon star freshman WR Dakorien Moore has inked an NIL deal with Red Bull🔥https://t.co/FcFzoOQqkx pic.twitter.com/8bwaMAraSO\n\n— On3 NIL (@On3NIL) December 12, 2025\n\nMoore has become one of the rare freshmen that gets the chance to step on the field for the Ducks and he has made that leap of faith worth their while. If he continues on this trajectory, then there is no reason to believe that he won’t continue to rack up collaborations with other major corporations during his time in college.\n\nThis deal with Red Bull should be one of the first in a long line of significant sponsorships.\n\nContact/Follow @Ducks_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oregon Ducks news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ducks Wire: Oregon WR Dakorien Moore signs NIL deal with Red Bull",

    "description": "A warehouse worker consumed 8 energy drinks a day to \"stay alert\" at work, which led to a dangerous health condition",
    "fullText": "A “fit and well” man was rushed to the hospital after suffering a stroke caused by blood pressure that was “sky high”\n\nAfter he was discharged, his blood pressure began to rise again, and upon a follow-up visit, he shared with his doctors that he consumes 8 energy drinks a day\n\nThe man was drinking more than 3 times the recommended amount of caffeine\n\nA “fit and well” man’s habit of downing 8 energy drinks a day caused him to have a stroke — and he’s left with lingering damage.\n\nA 54-year-old warehouse worker arrived to the emergency room with numbness, weakness on his left side, and ataxia (trouble with balance and movement), according to a case report in BMJ Journals. He was “normally fit and well,” the report says —  except for his blood pressure.\n\n“His blood pressure was sky high — about 254 over 150 millimeters — yet when you looked at him you’d never know it, because he looked so well. That’s why we call hypertension the silent killer,” Dr. Sunil Munshi, a consulting physician at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust in the United Kingdom, and senior author of the report, told CNN.\n\nNormal blood pressure for a man his age is less than 120 over less than 80, per the American Heart Association. His numbers are classified as a “hypertensive emergency.”\n\nThe blood pressure had caused “a stroke in the deeper part of the brain, the thalamus, which explains the unsteadiness,” Munshi told the outlet. The man, a warehouse worker from the Sherwood district of the English city of Nottingham, was admitted and treated with five different medications to make his blood pressure drop.\n\nAfter he was discharged, his blood pressure began to increase again, leaving doctors baffled — until, as Munshi shares, he told doctors about his energy drink habit.\n\n“Each day he consumed eight highly potent energy drinks to stay alert for his job — two cans at four different times during the day,” Munshi told CNN. “Each of the drinks contained 160 milligrams of caffeine. Suddenly the diagnosis was clear.”\n\nThe Mayo Clinic says that up to 400 milligrams of caffeine a day “seems safe” for most adults; the patient was drinking more than three times that amount.\n\nToo much caffeine can increase your risk of developing cardiovascular disease, according to a study from the American College of Cardiology.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nHe stopped drinking the energy drinks (the specific brand was not identified in the study), and his blood pressure returned to normal. But the lingering impact of his stroke and energy drink habit remain, he told his doctors, per CNN.\n\n“I obviously wasn’t aware of the dangers drinking energy drinks were causing to myself,” he said, explaining he’s “been left with numbness [in my] left hand side hand and fingers, foot and toes even after 8 years.”\n\nAs Munshi explained, there are other ingredients in energy drinks that can contribute to health problems. “Energy drinks that contain caffeine plus taurine produce significantly higher blood pressure than caffeine alone,” he said. “They also contain high levels of glucose — we know sugar damages the blood vessels in diabetes which leads to heart damage.”",
