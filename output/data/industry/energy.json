    "fullText": "The long-predicted \"super glut\" of oil is expected to hit energy markets in 2026.\n\nTrafigura, one of the world's biggest commodities trading firms, said it believes the oil market will see a flood of new supply at a time when the demand outlook is softening globally.\n\n\"If we look at what is driving the expectations of that super glut, it's hard to see how we don't get there,\" Saad Rahim, the chief economist at Trafigura, said in a video posted with the firm's annual financial results on Tuesday.\n\nThere are two things that feed into the expected glut of crude next year, Rahim said:\n\nThe crude market has already been feeling the effects of the supply-demand imbalance this year. Apart from a brief blip during the Israel-Iran conflict over the summer, oil prices have been trending lower all year. Brent crude, the international benchmark, traded around $62 a barrel on Tuesday, down 18% year-to-date. West Texas Intermediate crude traded around $58 a barrel, down 19% year-to-date.\n\n\"Whether it's a glut or a super glut, it's really hard to get away from that,\" he added, though he noted that factors like tighter sanctions and decreased production among OPEC nations and the US could help with the supply outlook.\n\nIf China, one of the world's largest oil consumers, were to slow its oil purchases, that could be another factor that could usher in the supply glut, he added.\n\nThe firm's view tracks with what other forecasters see for the oil market next year, some of whom have floated the possibility of a supply glut in the past.\n\nIn its November report, the International Energy Agency said it expected the world's oil supply to surge by over 3 million barrels a day in 2026 while demand growth remains \"modest by historical standards.\" The agency added that the balance of the market looked \"increasingly askew.\"",

    "description": "Merck and Duke Energy stand out as rare “safe yield” plays, pairing 3%+ dividends with solid earnings growth, reasonable payout ratios, and durable demand drivers in healthcare and regulated utilities.",
    "fullText": "The Fed just reminded everyone that the path to lower rates won't be a straight line. In late October, policymakers delivered a second cut this year. The benchmark rate was trimmed by 0.25 points to about 3.9%. They aimed to support growth and hiring even though inflation remains above the 2% goal.\n\nShortly after, two Fed officials publicly pushed back against another December reduction. They argue that future moves will depend heavily on incoming data rather than any preset easing script. Markets took the hint quickly as the dollar has bounced, and gold has slumped.\n\nOur exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most. \n\nThat same repricing has pushed investors to focus more on dependable cash flow and balance sheet strength. The search for quality income is undoubtedly why Triumvirate recently highlighted Merck (MRK) and Duke Energy (DUK) as two of the top high-yield stocks to own right now.\n\nSo in a market full of high-yield landmines, what exactly sets Merck and Duke Energy apart as two of the safest dividend stocks income investors can buy right now? Let’s find out.\n\nMerck & Co., with roughly $252.7B in market capitalization, develops human and animal health therapies spanning oncology, vaccines, infectious diseases, and cardiometabolic care. Its dividend profile fits neatly with the “safe high-yield” thesis, with a forward annual dividend of $3.24 per share and a forward yield of 3.09%, plus a next ex-dividend date scheduled for 12/15/25 and a payout ratio of 37.38%.\n\nMRK sits at $102.81 as of Dec. 3, up 3.2% year-to-date (YTD) and 0.82% over the last 52 weeks.\n\nIts valuation picture shows investors paying 12.12x trailing earnings and 0.96x on a PEG basis versus sector medians of 17.87x and 1.86x, signaling a discount multiple for a business still producing solid growth.​\n\nIts dividend looks even sturdier when set against the earnings engine. This latest quarterly report, released for the period ending 09/25, showed total worldwide sales of $17.3B, up 4% year-over-year (YoY), or 3% excluding currency effects. It highlighted KEYTRUDA as the main driver, with sales of $8.1B, climbing 10% reported and 8% on a constant-currency basis. This also broke out WINREVAIR revenue at $360M, up 141%, and CAPVAXIVE sales of $244M, underscoring depth beyond the flagship oncology franchise.\n\nIt noted that GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 slipped to $1.7B, down 24%, or 25% excluding FX, while Animal Health grew 9% to $1.6B, or 7% in constant currency. This translated into GAAP EPS of $2.32 and non‑GAAP EPS of $2.58, with both figures including a $0.10 per‑share charge tied to a milestone payment to LaNova. It also beat the quarter’s $2.36 consensus by $0.22, a 9.32% upside surprise.​",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Congress urged to act against energy-hungry facilities blamed for increasing bills and worsening climate crisis\n\nA coalition of more than 230 environmental groups has demanded a national moratorium on new datacenters in the US, the latest salvo in a growing backlash to a booming artificial intelligence industry that has been blamed for escalating electricity bills and worsening the climate crisis.\n\nThe green groups, including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Food & Water Watch and dozens of local organizations, have urged members of Congress to halt the proliferation of energy-hungry datacenters, accusing them of causing planet-heating emissions, sucking up vast amounts of water and exacerbating electricity bill increases that have hit Americans this year.\n\n“The rapid, largely unregulated rise of datacenters to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans’ economic, environmental, climate and water security,” the letter states, adding that approval of new data centers should be paused until new regulations are put in place.\n\nThe push comes amid a growing revolt against moves by companies such as Meta, Google and Open AI to plow hundreds of billions of dollars into new datacenters, primarily to meet the huge computing demands of AI. At least 16 datacenter projects, worth a combined $64bn, have been blocked or delayed due to local opposition to rising electricity costs. The facilities’ need for huge amounts of water to cool down equipment has also proved controversial, particularly in drier areas where supplies are scarce.\n\nThese seemingly parochial concerns have now multiplied to become a potent political force, helping propel Democrats to a series of emphatic recent electoral successes in governor elections in Virginia and New Jersey as well as a stunning upset win in a special public service commission poll in Georgia, with candidates campaigning on lowering power bill costs and curbing datacenters.\n\nThis threatens to be a major headache for Donald Trump, who has aggressively pushed the growth of AI but also called himself the “affordability president” and vowed to cut energy costs in half in his first year.\n\nHowever, household electricity prices have increased by 13% so far under Trump and the president recently lashed out in the wake of the election losses, calling affordability a “fake narrative” and a “con job” created by Democrats. “They just say the word,” Trump said last week. “It doesn’t mean anything to anybody. They just say it – affordability.”\n\nYet about 80 million Americans are currently struggling to pay their bills for electricity and gas, with many voters regardless of political party blaming datacenters for this, according to Charles Hua, founder and executive director of PowerLines, a non-partisan organization that aims to reduce power bills.\n\n“We saw rising utility bills become a core concern in the New Jersey, Georgia and Virginia elections, which shows us there is a new politics in America – we are entering a new era that is all about electricity prices,” Hua said.\n\n“Nobody in America wants to pay more for electricity and we saw in Georgia a meaningful chunk of conservative voters vote against the Republican incumbents, which was staggering.”\n\nHua said the causes of the electricity cost rises were nuanced, with ageing transmission lines and damage caused by extreme weather also adding to utilities’ costs on top of the surging demand for power.\n\nBut it is the growth of datacenters to service AI – with electricity consumption set to nearly triple over the next decade, equivalent to powering 190m new homes – that is the focus of ire for voters as well as an unlikely sweep of politicians ranging from Bernie Sanders on the left to Marjorie Taylor Greene on the far right.\n\nMore broadly, almost half of Americans say the cost of living in the US, including power, food and other essentials, is the worst they can ever remember it being.\n\nThis focus on affordability has provided a new line of attack for an environmental movement that has struggled to counter Trump’s onslaught upon rules that reduce air and water pollution. The president has called the climate crisis a “hoax” and clean energy a “scam” and has slashed support for and even blocked new wind and solar projects, even though renewables are often the cheapest and fastest options for new power generation.\n\nAt the current rate of growth, datacenters could add up to 44m tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by 2030, equivalent to putting an extra 10m cars on to the road and exacerbating a climate crisis that is already spurring extreme weather disasters and ripping apart the fabric of the American insurance market.\n\nBut it is the impact upon power bills, rather than the climate crisis, that is causing anguish for most voters, acknowledged Emily Wurth, managing director of organizing at Food & Water Watch, the group behind the letter to lawmakers.\n\n“I’ve been amazed by the groundswell of grassroots, bipartisan opposition to this, in all types of communities across the US,” she said. “Everyone is affected by this, the opposition has been across the political spectrum. A lot of people don’t see the benefits coming from AI and feel they will be paying for it with their energy bills and water.\n\n“It’s an important talking point,” Wurth said of the affordability concerns. “We’ve seen outrageous utility price rises across the country and we are going to lean into this. Prices are going up across the board and this is something Americans really do care about.”",
