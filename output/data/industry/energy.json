    "description": "A warehouse worker consumed 8 energy drinks a day to \"stay alert\" at work, which led to a dangerous health condition",
    "fullText": "A “fit and well” man was rushed to the hospital after suffering a stroke caused by blood pressure that was “sky high”\n\nAfter he was discharged, his blood pressure began to rise again, and upon a follow-up visit, he shared with his doctors that he consumes 8 energy drinks a day\n\nThe man was drinking more than 3 times the recommended amount of caffeine\n\nA “fit and well” man’s habit of downing 8 energy drinks a day caused him to have a stroke — and he’s left with lingering damage.\n\nA 54-year-old warehouse worker arrived to the emergency room with numbness, weakness on his left side, and ataxia (trouble with balance and movement), according to a case report in BMJ Journals. He was “normally fit and well,” the report says —  except for his blood pressure.\n\n“His blood pressure was sky high — about 254 over 150 millimeters — yet when you looked at him you’d never know it, because he looked so well. That’s why we call hypertension the silent killer,” Dr. Sunil Munshi, a consulting physician at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust in the United Kingdom, and senior author of the report, told CNN.\n\nNormal blood pressure for a man his age is less than 120 over less than 80, per the American Heart Association. His numbers are classified as a “hypertensive emergency.”\n\nThe blood pressure had caused “a stroke in the deeper part of the brain, the thalamus, which explains the unsteadiness,” Munshi told the outlet. The man, a warehouse worker from the Sherwood district of the English city of Nottingham, was admitted and treated with five different medications to make his blood pressure drop.\n\nAfter he was discharged, his blood pressure began to increase again, leaving doctors baffled — until, as Munshi shares, he told doctors about his energy drink habit.\n\n“Each day he consumed eight highly potent energy drinks to stay alert for his job — two cans at four different times during the day,” Munshi told CNN. “Each of the drinks contained 160 milligrams of caffeine. Suddenly the diagnosis was clear.”\n\nThe Mayo Clinic says that up to 400 milligrams of caffeine a day “seems safe” for most adults; the patient was drinking more than three times that amount.\n\nToo much caffeine can increase your risk of developing cardiovascular disease, according to a study from the American College of Cardiology.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nHe stopped drinking the energy drinks (the specific brand was not identified in the study), and his blood pressure returned to normal. But the lingering impact of his stroke and energy drink habit remain, he told his doctors, per CNN.\n\n“I obviously wasn’t aware of the dangers drinking energy drinks were causing to myself,” he said, explaining he’s “been left with numbness [in my] left hand side hand and fingers, foot and toes even after 8 years.”\n\nAs Munshi explained, there are other ingredients in energy drinks that can contribute to health problems. “Energy drinks that contain caffeine plus taurine produce significantly higher blood pressure than caffeine alone,” he said. “They also contain high levels of glucose — we know sugar damages the blood vessels in diabetes which leads to heart damage.”",

    "description": "On Wednesday, US military and law enforcement agents seized an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast.",
    "fullText": "The high seas are increasingly dangerous territory for autocratic petrostates. On Wednesday, US military and law enforcement agents seized an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast. The ship had reportedly spent at least the past two years ferrying sanctioned crude from Iran and Venezuela, and using transponder tricks to obscure its location.\n\nNabbing the ship marks a drastic escalation in US President Donald Trump’s pressure campaign against Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, one that will be especially painful for Maduro’s deeply oil-reliant budget and that is probably on firmer legal footing than the recent spate of missile strikes on purported drug boats (and that could sting China, the main buyer of Venezuelan oil). The fate of the oil itself is less clear: “We keep it, I guess,” Trump said, which the Venezuelan government called “blatant theft.”\n\nThe bigger picture is that seaborne oil trade is quickly turning into the most exposed Achilles’ heel at the center of major global conflicts. The European Union and G7 are considering aggressive new financial measures against Russia’s “shadow fleet,” which now handles two-thirds of the country’s oil exports. Ukraine is acting more decisively on its own, with a recent string of naval drone attacks that hit five Russian oil vessels in far-flung corners of the globe over 13 days.\n\nIn the past, when Western governments sanctioned an adversary’s oil exports, they were loath to take “kinetic” action against sanction-dodging ships. Shadow vessels could be hard to track; interceptions risk oil spills or violations of international law; and political leaders are always fearful that attempts to squeeze an adversary’s oil revenue can backfire by raising energy prices at home.\n\nBut now, satellite imagery and other open-source data have made it much harder to hide on the high seas. And oil prices are relatively low amidst an oversupplied global market, reducing the risk of significant price blowback. In fact, that market glut is most visible at sea: The total number of barrels currently on ships is 24% higher than the average of the last decade, and the number of sanctioned barrels has leapt 82% in the past year. The seas are awash, in other words, in juicy oil targets.\n\nWould Russia or Venezuela risk a direct engagement with the US Navy in defense of commercial oil vessels? The Pentagon seems to find that unlikely. Still, there’s a lesson here about the security risks faced by both buyers and sellers of seaborne fossil fuels — one that applies to the US as much as its adversaries.",

    "description": "Oil prices stumbled in 2025 on weaker demand and surging supply. One of the world's biggest commodities firms says the dynamic will worsen in 2026.",
    "fullText": "The long-predicted \"super glut\" of oil is expected to hit energy markets in 2026.\n\nTrafigura, one of the world's biggest commodities trading firms, said it believes the oil market will see a flood of new supply at a time when the demand outlook is softening globally.\n\n\"If we look at what is driving the expectations of that super glut, it's hard to see how we don't get there,\" Saad Rahim, the chief economist at Trafigura, said in a video posted with the firm's annual financial results on Tuesday.\n\nThere are two things that feed into the expected glut of crude next year, Rahim said:\n\nThe crude market has already been feeling the effects of the supply-demand imbalance this year. Apart from a brief blip during the Israel-Iran conflict over the summer, oil prices have been trending lower all year. Brent crude, the international benchmark, traded around $62 a barrel on Tuesday, down 18% year-to-date. West Texas Intermediate crude traded around $58 a barrel, down 19% year-to-date.\n\n\"Whether it's a glut or a super glut, it's really hard to get away from that,\" he added, though he noted that factors like tighter sanctions and decreased production among OPEC nations and the US could help with the supply outlook.\n\nIf China, one of the world's largest oil consumers, were to slow its oil purchases, that could be another factor that could usher in the supply glut, he added.\n\nThe firm's view tracks with what other forecasters see for the oil market next year, some of whom have floated the possibility of a supply glut in the past.\n\nIn its November report, the International Energy Agency said it expected the world's oil supply to surge by over 3 million barrels a day in 2026 while demand growth remains \"modest by historical standards.\" The agency added that the balance of the market looked \"increasingly askew.\"",

    "description": "Merck and Duke Energy stand out as rare “safe yield” plays, pairing 3%+ dividends with solid earnings growth, reasonable payout ratios, and durable demand drivers in healthcare and regulated utilities.",
    "fullText": "The Fed just reminded everyone that the path to lower rates won't be a straight line. In late October, policymakers delivered a second cut this year. The benchmark rate was trimmed by 0.25 points to about 3.9%. They aimed to support growth and hiring even though inflation remains above the 2% goal.\n\nShortly after, two Fed officials publicly pushed back against another December reduction. They argue that future moves will depend heavily on incoming data rather than any preset easing script. Markets took the hint quickly as the dollar has bounced, and gold has slumped.\n\nOur exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most. \n\nThat same repricing has pushed investors to focus more on dependable cash flow and balance sheet strength. The search for quality income is undoubtedly why Triumvirate recently highlighted Merck (MRK) and Duke Energy (DUK) as two of the top high-yield stocks to own right now.\n\nSo in a market full of high-yield landmines, what exactly sets Merck and Duke Energy apart as two of the safest dividend stocks income investors can buy right now? Let’s find out.\n\nMerck & Co., with roughly $252.7B in market capitalization, develops human and animal health therapies spanning oncology, vaccines, infectious diseases, and cardiometabolic care. Its dividend profile fits neatly with the “safe high-yield” thesis, with a forward annual dividend of $3.24 per share and a forward yield of 3.09%, plus a next ex-dividend date scheduled for 12/15/25 and a payout ratio of 37.38%.\n\nMRK sits at $102.81 as of Dec. 3, up 3.2% year-to-date (YTD) and 0.82% over the last 52 weeks.\n\nIts valuation picture shows investors paying 12.12x trailing earnings and 0.96x on a PEG basis versus sector medians of 17.87x and 1.86x, signaling a discount multiple for a business still producing solid growth.​\n\nIts dividend looks even sturdier when set against the earnings engine. This latest quarterly report, released for the period ending 09/25, showed total worldwide sales of $17.3B, up 4% year-over-year (YoY), or 3% excluding currency effects. It highlighted KEYTRUDA as the main driver, with sales of $8.1B, climbing 10% reported and 8% on a constant-currency basis. This also broke out WINREVAIR revenue at $360M, up 141%, and CAPVAXIVE sales of $244M, underscoring depth beyond the flagship oncology franchise.\n\nIt noted that GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 slipped to $1.7B, down 24%, or 25% excluding FX, while Animal Health grew 9% to $1.6B, or 7% in constant currency. This translated into GAAP EPS of $2.32 and non‑GAAP EPS of $2.58, with both figures including a $0.10 per‑share charge tied to a milestone payment to LaNova. It also beat the quarter’s $2.36 consensus by $0.22, a 9.32% upside surprise.​",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Congress urged to act against energy-hungry facilities blamed for increasing bills and worsening climate crisis\n\nA coalition of more than 230 environmental groups has demanded a national moratorium on new datacenters in the US, the latest salvo in a growing backlash to a booming artificial intelligence industry that has been blamed for escalating electricity bills and worsening the climate crisis.\n\nThe green groups, including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Food & Water Watch and dozens of local organizations, have urged members of Congress to halt the proliferation of energy-hungry datacenters, accusing them of causing planet-heating emissions, sucking up vast amounts of water and exacerbating electricity bill increases that have hit Americans this year.\n\n“The rapid, largely unregulated rise of datacenters to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans’ economic, environmental, climate and water security,” the letter states, adding that approval of new data centers should be paused until new regulations are put in place.\n\nThe push comes amid a growing revolt against moves by companies such as Meta, Google and Open AI to plow hundreds of billions of dollars into new datacenters, primarily to meet the huge computing demands of AI. At least 16 datacenter projects, worth a combined $64bn, have been blocked or delayed due to local opposition to rising electricity costs. The facilities’ need for huge amounts of water to cool down equipment has also proved controversial, particularly in drier areas where supplies are scarce.\n\nThese seemingly parochial concerns have now multiplied to become a potent political force, helping propel Democrats to a series of emphatic recent electoral successes in governor elections in Virginia and New Jersey as well as a stunning upset win in a special public service commission poll in Georgia, with candidates campaigning on lowering power bill costs and curbing datacenters.\n\nThis threatens to be a major headache for Donald Trump, who has aggressively pushed the growth of AI but also called himself the “affordability president” and vowed to cut energy costs in half in his first year.\n\nHowever, household electricity prices have increased by 13% so far under Trump and the president recently lashed out in the wake of the election losses, calling affordability a “fake narrative” and a “con job” created by Democrats. “They just say the word,” Trump said last week. “It doesn’t mean anything to anybody. They just say it – affordability.”\n\nYet about 80 million Americans are currently struggling to pay their bills for electricity and gas, with many voters regardless of political party blaming datacenters for this, according to Charles Hua, founder and executive director of PowerLines, a non-partisan organization that aims to reduce power bills.\n\n“We saw rising utility bills become a core concern in the New Jersey, Georgia and Virginia elections, which shows us there is a new politics in America – we are entering a new era that is all about electricity prices,” Hua said.\n\n“Nobody in America wants to pay more for electricity and we saw in Georgia a meaningful chunk of conservative voters vote against the Republican incumbents, which was staggering.”\n\nHua said the causes of the electricity cost rises were nuanced, with ageing transmission lines and damage caused by extreme weather also adding to utilities’ costs on top of the surging demand for power.\n\nBut it is the growth of datacenters to service AI – with electricity consumption set to nearly triple over the next decade, equivalent to powering 190m new homes – that is the focus of ire for voters as well as an unlikely sweep of politicians ranging from Bernie Sanders on the left to Marjorie Taylor Greene on the far right.\n\nMore broadly, almost half of Americans say the cost of living in the US, including power, food and other essentials, is the worst they can ever remember it being.\n\nThis focus on affordability has provided a new line of attack for an environmental movement that has struggled to counter Trump’s onslaught upon rules that reduce air and water pollution. The president has called the climate crisis a “hoax” and clean energy a “scam” and has slashed support for and even blocked new wind and solar projects, even though renewables are often the cheapest and fastest options for new power generation.\n\nAt the current rate of growth, datacenters could add up to 44m tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by 2030, equivalent to putting an extra 10m cars on to the road and exacerbating a climate crisis that is already spurring extreme weather disasters and ripping apart the fabric of the American insurance market.\n\nBut it is the impact upon power bills, rather than the climate crisis, that is causing anguish for most voters, acknowledged Emily Wurth, managing director of organizing at Food & Water Watch, the group behind the letter to lawmakers.\n\n“I’ve been amazed by the groundswell of grassroots, bipartisan opposition to this, in all types of communities across the US,” she said. “Everyone is affected by this, the opposition has been across the political spectrum. A lot of people don’t see the benefits coming from AI and feel they will be paying for it with their energy bills and water.\n\n“It’s an important talking point,” Wurth said of the affordability concerns. “We’ve seen outrageous utility price rises across the country and we are going to lean into this. Prices are going up across the board and this is something Americans really do care about.”",
