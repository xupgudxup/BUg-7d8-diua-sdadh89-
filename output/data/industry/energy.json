    "description": "Eighteen states will restrict what SNAP users can buy with their benefits in 2026, including soda, candy, and energy drinks. See the changes by state.",
    "fullText": "Big changes are coming to how shoppers can use SNAP food benefits in some states.\n\nStarting on January 1, some states are planning to implement new rules limiting purchases of soda, energy drinks, candy, and other foods for people who receive SNAP benefits, according to a list of changes provided by the Department of Agriculture. In total, 18 states plan to introduce new restrictions in 2026.\n\nNearly 42 million people, or about 12% of the US resident population, relied on SNAP benefits each month during the 2024 federal fiscal year, according to the Department of Agriculture.\n\nThe coming changes are in line with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Make America Healthy Again effort. Along with skepticism of vaccine mandates, Kennedy has highlighted the importance of limiting the consumption of certain food ingredients, such as sugar and some food dyes, as a priority.\n\nTo implement the changes, states had to request waivers from the federal government for existing rules governing how SNAP benefits can be spent.\n\nWhether clamping down on purchases of sugary drinks and other foods will make people who rely on SNAP to buy food healthier remains unclear.\n\nIn many cases, shoppers and retailers haven't been provided with a list of which products would no longer be eligible for purchase with SNAP dollars, the anti-hunger advocacy group Food Research and Action Center, or FRAC, wrote in a blog post on December 29.\n\nIn Iowa, for instance, the changes indicate that products, including vitamins and minerals, as well as candy-coated products, will no longer be eligible for SNAP in the new year. But that directive won't help shoppers as they head to the store, FRAC said.\n\n\"The items list does not provide enough specific information to prepare a SNAP participant to go to the grocery store,\" FRAC wrote.\n\nHere are all 18 states that are changing which foods are SNAP-eligible in 2026, per the Department of Agriculture:\n\nStarting July 1, SNAP rules in Arkansas will restrict purchases of soda, \"unhealthy drinks,\" drinks that are less than 50% natural juice, and candy.\n\nColorado will restrict the purchase of soft drinks with SNAP funds on March 1.\n\nFlorida SNAP shoppers will face new restrictions on purchases of soda, energy drinks, candy, and \"prepared desserts\" starting on April 20.\n\nThe 50th state will limit SNAP shoppers' ability to purchase soft drinks, beginning on August 1.\n\nSoda and candy purchases will be restricted for SNAP users in Idaho starting on February 15.\n\nIn Indiana, shoppers who use SNAP benefits will face new restrictions on buying soft drinks and candy on January 1.\n\nIowa, another state enacting SNAP changes on January 1, will restrict purchases of \"all taxable food items.\" According to a notice sent to SNAP recipients in that state, that means that shoppers can't purchase soda, candy, candy-coated items, vitamins and minerals, chewing gum, or drinks with 50% or less fruit and vegetable juice.\n\nLouisiana will restrict SNAP purchases of soft drinks, energy drinks, and candy starting February 18.\n\nPeople who use SNAP benefits in Missouri will see new restrictions on buying candy, prepared desserts, and \"certain unhealthy beverages\" starting on October 1.\n\nNebraska SNAP recipients will face restrictions on buying soda and energy drinks starting on January 1.\n\nOklahoma shoppers who use SNAP will see fresh restrictions on purchasing soft drinks and candy as of February 15.\n\nCandy, energy drinks, soft drinks, and sweetened beverages will all face new SNAP buying restrictions in South Carolina on August 31.\n\nOn July 31, Tennessee will restrict SNAP purchases of processed foods and beverages, \"such as soda, energy drinks, and candy.\"\n\nTexas' new rule, which takes effect on April 1, will limit purchases of sweetened drinks and candy among SNAP shoppers.\n\nUtah will restrict the purchase of soft drinks for SNAP users starting January 1.\n\nPurchases of \"sweetened beverages\" will be restricted for SNAP users in Virginia starting on April 1.\n\nBuying soda will be restricted for SNAP shoppers in West Virginia starting on January 1.",

    "fullText": "Crew members aboard the aging, rusted oil tanker that the US has been pursuing at sea for nearly two weeks appear to have painted a crude image of a Russian flag on the ship’s hull, which American officials believe is an attempt at claiming Russian protection, a US official familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe new insignia was spotted by Coast Guard personnel, who are trailing the tanker from about a half-mile behind as it sails in the open Atlantic Ocean away from Venezuela, the official said.\n\nIt wasn’t clear when the new flag appeared on the side of the Bella 1. The massive tanker has been resisting seizure since December 21, when it made a U-turn in the Caribbean Sea after the Coast Guard attempted to interdict it on its way into Venezuela to pick up oil.\n\nThe flag, which the US official said was sloppily painted on the side of the ship by its crew, was the latest development in the slow-speed pursuit of the vessel, which is under US sanctions for allegedly shipping Iranian oil. The New York Times first reported the new flag.\n\nUS officials said the Bella 1 was flying under the flag of Guyana, which they said was not valid, when the Coast Guard originally tried to board it. Its current registration is listed as “not known” on the shipping database Equasis. By claiming Russian status, the legalities of seizing the vessel could become more complicated.\n\nAmerican officials no longer expect the Bella 1 to return to Venezuela to load up with oil, and it’s possible the Trump administration will decide to abandon its effort to seize the ship.\n\nBut until then, assets have been readied in case the order comes from the White House to reattempt a seizure of the tanker. That would require a Maritime Special Response Team with experience in boarding vessels that do not submit to seize control of it.\n\nThe pursuit stems from Trump’s order of a “blockade” on sanctioned Venezuelan oil tankers. Administration officials believe squeezing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s main economic lifeline is the best path to potentially ousting the authoritarian leader.\n\nOfficials aren’t sure why the crew of the Bella 1 did not stop the ship and submit to the Coast Guard’s efforts to interdict it, as two previous oil tankers did this month.",

    "description": "New reporting from the accountability site DeSmog reveals the gas industry knew about these risks for decades.",
    "fullText": "A shocking study from December 2022 revealed that gas stoves cause one in eight cases of childhood asthma, in addition to contributing to a wide range of other health issues.\n\nMore recent reporting from the accountability site DeSmog reveals that both the gas industry and the government knew about these risks as far back as 50 years ago. However, as Grist reports, the gas industry managed to cover up these health hazards for decades.\n\nIn 1972, the American Gas Association raised concerns about indoor air quality in a report on natural gas. The group showed evidence that gas appliances, such as gas stoves, were likely leaking poisonous carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide into homes.\n\nHowever, after this report went to the National Industrial Pollution Control Council, it was reviewed by a \"government advisory council,\" primarily made up of business executives in the industry who likely would lose money when the information went public, reports Grist. After the review, the concerns about in-home pollution were removed from the report.\n\nWe have carbon monoxide detectors in our houses with the knowledge that too much of it is deadly, and the Environmental Protection Agency refers to nitrogen oxide as a \"poisonous gas\" and diligently regulates it.\n\nThe link between these gases and childhood asthma means that gas stoves are a partial reason for an increase in a chronic, debilitating, or sometimes deadly illness in children.\n\nAsthma causes the lungs to become inflamed more easily and ranges in severity. According to Mayo Clinic, \"childhood asthma is the leading cause of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and missed school days.\"\n\nWhat's more, these gas stoves also release methane gas — and while researchers do not believe that methane is being leaked in amounts that are harmful to people, it is harmful to the environment.\n\nThese gases are planet-warming gases — and methane especially is a powerful driver of increasing global temperatures.\n\nNow that the information is public, governments and organizations are making moves to reduce the use of gas appliances.\n\nSome cities in the U.S. are attempting to \"phase out\" gas in current building projects and eventually transition off of it completely.\n\nOn a personal level, just getting the word out helps to create change. Even if you can't replace your stove, it is important to share the knowledge and to keep it in mind if and when you do buy something new.\n\nElectric stoves — particularly induction stoves, which cook faster and are easier to clean — are great alternatives that don't release the toxic gases that we now know gas stoves create so much of.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for cool news and actionable info that makes it easy to help yourself while helping the planet.",

    "fullText": "Oil prices are on track for their steepest annual drop since the Covid-era crash in 2020, battered by fears of a deepening supply glut — and compounding economic pressure on Russia as sanctions and discounts bite harder.\n\nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures are trading around $58 a barrel, down nearly 20% for the year. Meanwhile, Brent crude futures are around $61 a barrel.\n\nOil prices have been on a downtrend due to rising output from producers and slowing demand growth.\n\nThe supply-demand dynamic has weighed heavily on prices, dulling the impact of geopolitical tensions that might otherwise have lifted crude, including US strikes on Iran in June and the US's blockade of sanctioned oil tankers going to and from Venezuela.\n\n\"What's really stood out in oil markets this year is the lack of volatility, particularly given the myriad geopolitical events and supply risks,\" wrote Warren Patterson, the head of commodities strategy at ING, earlier this month.\n\nPatterson attributed that to fatigue over geopolitical developments and growing expectations of a supply surplus toward the latter part of the year.\n\nFor Russia, persistently low prices have magnified the impact of sweeping Western sanctions over its February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDiscounts on Russian oil sold at export terminals have climbed back toward historic highs, squeezing exporters' profits just as energy revenues become more critical for Russian President Vladimir Putin's administration.\n\nRussian crude sold at discounts of $20 to $30 a barrel below the Brent oil price in December, making its widest gap at ports since early 2022, according to data from Reuters.\n\nAn analysis from Goldman Sachs earlier this month showed Russia's oil export revenues, measured in rubles, have plunged 50% this year, tumbling from the equivalent of 7.6% of GDP to just 3.7%.\n\nThe pressure comes as Russia's economic momentum slows.\n\nRussia's GDP grew 0.6% in the third quarter from a year ago, slower than the growth rates of 1.1% in the second quarter and 1.4% in the first quarter.\n\nEconomic growth is set to cool even more sharply. The central bank now sees economic expansion of just 0.5% to 1.5% in 2026 and cut its 2025 growth forecast to 0.5% to 1%, down from earlier expectations.\n\nThat follows economic growth of 4.3% in 2024, when defense spending, state subsidies, and higher energy revenues bolstered Russia's economy.",

The Qinghai cluster can produce almost 17,000 megawatts of power, according to the New York Times, but it isn't just a huge producer of energy.\n\nA study published in the Nature journal also claims that the presence of miles of solar panels changes the desert environment around the farm, and actually helps improve the biodiversity of the surrounding area. The study analysed a wide range of environmental factors, including the nutrients in the soil around the solar farms, the range of plant and microbial species that lived there, and the humidity of the surrounding air.\n\nResearchers found that the presence of the solar farm helped boost moisture levels in the soil, which in turn affected its structure. They suggested that the increased moisture could be due to the panels absorbing most of the Sun's radiation, which led to the soil underneath losing less water through evaporation. The regular washing of the panels was also noted as a potential reason for the increased soil moisture content.\n\nThe improved condition of the soil helped a wider variety of microbes and plants live within the grounds of the solar farm than in the surrounding desert. It's fresh evidence that, as well as helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by providing clean electricity, solar panels can also help the environment in more unexpected ways. The study also noted that the solar farm required local workers to operate, which helped boost jobs in an area where there were otherwise relatively few opportunities for employment.\n\nChina has an advantage when it comes to creating giant solar farms, since most of the world's solar cell supply comes from Chinese manufacturers. It also has a huge domestic demand for electricity, particularly since it's the world's largest EV market by a significant margin. According to IEA, 17 million EVs were sold worldwide in 2024, and more than 11 million of those were sold in China. Around 10% of all cars on the road in China are electric, and to power them, the country will need to keep developing projects like the Qinghai solar farm cluster. If it keeps building them within its vast deserts, these farms will potentially have the bonus side effect of improving the quality of the environment around them, too.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

At recent United Nations climate talks, South Korea's new Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment announced plans to retire most of the country’s coal-fired power plants by 2040 and to at least halve its carbon emissions by 2035.",
    "fullText": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea is promising to shrink its reliance on coal power as part of its pledge to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to climate change, but that ambition is at odds with the Trump administration’s push for more U.S. natural gas exports.\n\nAt recent United Nations climate talks, South Korea's new Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment announced plans to retire most of the country’s coal-fired power plants by 2040 and to at least halve its carbon emissions by 2035.\n\nExperts say this shows that South Korea, a major coal importer with one of the world’s largest fleets of coal plants, wants to speed up its renewable energy transition, which lags behind its neighbors and global averages.\n\nBut as part of trade deals with President Donald Trump, Seoul is raising imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas, or LNG. Climate activists contend such plans may conflict with the country’s pledges to help curb climate change and could lock South Korea into a fossil fuel-dependent future.\n\nTalks are underway for South Korea to invest $350 billion in U.S. projects and purchase up to $100 billion worth of U.S. energy products, including LNG, a natural gas cooled to liquid form for easy storage and travel. It burns cleaner than coal, but still causes planet-warming emissions, especially of methane.\n\nSouth Korea’s overall LNG imports may not increase if it offsets purchases of more U.S. natural gas by reducing imports from other sources such as Australia and the Middle East.\n\nStill, it's unclear how South Korea will “manage and consolidate all this somehow contradictory planning regarding its energy sector,\" said Michelle Kim, an energy specialist for the U.S.-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.\n\nPower transition sparks climate goals\n\nSouth Korea's liberal President Lee Jae Myung, who won a snap election in June, campaigned for stronger climate commitments. They had softened under his conservative predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol, who was ousted after a short-lived martial law declaration.\n\n“As the global temperature rises, we all need to responsibly take climate action and Korea will have a stronger sense of responsibility in tackling the climate crisis,\" Kim Sung-hwan, the inaugural Minister of Climate, Energy and Environment, said in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\nSouth Korea's goal to cut carbon emissions by 53% to 61% of its 2018 level, fell short of climate activists’ expectations. Business lobbies representing major manufacturers had proposed a 48% emissions reduction target.\n\n“This range presents an effort by the government to accommodate two very different ways of thinking about the economic and climate future of the nation,” said Joojin Kim of the Seoul-based advocacy group, Solutions for Our Climate.\n\nSouth Korea faces climate dilemma over U.S. deal\n\nThe South Korean government made the ambitious commitment to increase its clean energy use even after Trump's sweeping ‘America First’ tariffs spurred energy negotiations between Seoul and Washington.\n\nAs part of its broader efforts to avoid higher tariffs, South Korea offered to import more LNG from the U.S., but the final trade deal has not been announced.\n\nThe agreement still under negotiation could last between three to 10 years, according to industry analysis and U.S. federal documents. Depending on the deal's duration, South Korea may import between 3 million to 9 million tons of American LNG a year.\n\nLNG made up almost a fifth of South Korea’s total energy supply last year, according to the International Energy Agency, or IEA. The government's target was to cut that to 10.6% by 2038.\n\nSouth Korea risks its climate goals if the pending trade deal increases the total volume of imported LNG, which will likely lead to an oversupply issue and the excess burning of gas to justify the deal, said Insung Lee, with Greenpeace in Seoul.\n\n“If we just replace coal plants with LNG, that means the coal exit actually doesn’t lead to a green transition and merely shifts Korea’s addiction from coal to gas, which undermines the whole spirit of climate action,\" Lee said.\n\nRenewable energy generated 7% of South Korea’s domestic power in 2022, according to the IEA. South Korean government data show that had increased to 10.5% last year, still one of the lowest levels among leading economies.\n\nJapan, with an economy more than twice as big, generates 21% of its power from renewable sources. Spain, whose economy is about the same size as South Korea's, gets 42% of its power from renewable sources.\n\nClean energy provided about 30% of global electricity production in 2023.\n\nNuclear power produces a major share of South Korea's domestic energy, with government data showing that nuclear sources accounted for 31% of total electricity generation last year.\n\n“We will transition into a new energy system that focuses on renewables and nuclear, while phasing out coal,” said Kim, the energy minister. He said South Korea will use LNG as a “complementary or emergency energy source” to make up for irregularities in renewable energy supplies.\n\nIn early December, South Korea set another goal of boosting its offshore wind power capacity to 4 gigawatts, about 10 times the current level.\n\nSouth Korean companies that don’t cut back on carbon emissions may find that to be a competitive disadvantage, said Michelle Kim of the IEEFA.\n\nMany global industries, including shipping and aviation, face pressure to reduce their emissions by providing incentives for low emitters and creating deterrents for high ones, she said.\n\n“This is a lot of risk,” she said. “South Korea needs to speed up renewable energy deployment and come out from high dependency on the fossil fuel industry.”\n\nCoal trade braces for South Korea cuts\n\nAt last month's climate talks, South Korea joined the Powering Past Coal Alliance, a group of businesses, organizations and governments promoting the green energy transition.\n\nThat's mainly a symbolic move, said Bruce Douglas, with the Global Renewables Alliance. “But it signifies very clear government intention to move away from fossil fuels and towards clean power.”\n\nSouth Korea imports virtually all its coal, largely from Australia, Indonesia and Russia, and the switch to renewables is bound to impact regional markets.\n\nThe pledge to retire 40 of South Korea's 61 coal sites by 2040 may be “an enforced transition\" for coal exporters in the Asia-Pacific region, said James Bowen, with Climate Analytics. “It’s a reality that they’re going to have to face this downturn in the market.”\n\n“The writing's on the wall,\" Bowen said. “One of the biggest importers in the world, one of the biggest customers, is starting to move away from coal.”\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "fullText": "The chipmaker’s sprawling partnerships are driving extraordinary growth but also bank its future on the AI boom paying off quickly\n\nNvidia is, in crucial ways, nothing like Enron – the Houston energy giant that imploded through multibillion-dollar accounting fraud in 2001. Nor is it similar to companies such as Lucent or Worldcom that folded during the dotcom bubble.\n\nBut the fact that it needs to reiterate this to its investors is less than ideal.\n\nNow worth more than $4tn (£3tn), Nvidia makes the specialised technology that powers the world’s AI surge: silicon chips and software packages that train and host systems such as ChatGPT. Its products fill datacentres from Norway to New Jersey.\n\nThis year has been an exceptional one for the company: it has struck at least $125bn in deals, ranging from a $5bn investment into Intel – to facilitate its access to the PC market – to $100bn invested in OpenAI, the startup behind ChatGPT.\n\nBut even as those deals have fuelled surging stock prices and paved the way for chief executive Jensen Huang’s energetic world tour, doubts have emerged about how Nvidia does business, especially as it has become increasingly central to the health of the global economy.\n\nThe start of these concerns has been the circular nature of many of its deals. These arrangements resemble vendor financing: Nvidia lending money to customers so they can buy its products.\n\nThe largest of these is its deal with OpenAI, which involves Nvidia investing $10bn into the company each year for the next 10 years – most of which will go to buying Nvidia’s chips. Another is its arrangement with CoreWeave, a company that provides on-demand computing capacity to big AI firms, essentially leasing out Nvidia’s chips.\n\nThe circularity of these deals has drawn comparisons with Lucent Technologies, a telecoms company that also aggressively lent money to its customers, only to overextend itself and unravel in the early 2000s. Nvidia has aggressively rebutted suggestions of any similarity, saying in a leaked recent memo that it “does not rely on vendor financing arrangements to grow revenue”.\n\nJames Anderson, a renowned tech investor, describes himself as a “huge admirer” of Nvidia, but said this year that the OpenAI deal presented “more reason to be concerned there than before”.\n\nHe added: “I have to say the words ‘vendor financing’ do not carry nice reflections to somebody of my age. It’s not quite like what many of the telecom suppliers were up to in 1999-2000, but it has certain rhymes to it. I don’t think it makes me feel entirely comfortable from that point of view.”\n\nOther high-profile recent deals include the tech firm Oracle spending $300bn on datacentres for OpenAI in the US – with the ChatGPT developer then paying back roughly the same amount to use those datacentres. In October, OpenAI and the chipmaker AMD signed a multibillion-dollar chip deal that also gave OpenAI the option to buy a stake in the Nvidia rival.\n\nThere is also a deal with CoreWeave where, along with a commitment to buying $22bn of data centre capacity from the cloud provider, OpenAI is receiving $350m in CoreWeave stock. Asked this month about circularity in the AI industry, the chief executive of CoreWeave, Michael Intrator, said: “Companies are trying to address a violent change in supply and demand. You do that by working together.”\n\nAll these moves form part of OpenAI’s $1.4tn bet on computing capacity to build and operate models that, it argues, will transform economies – and make back that expenditure. OpenAI argues that, while the Nvidia and AMD deals have an investment component, it only kicks in once the chips have been bought and deployed, while the investments themselves create aligned incentives to build out AI infrastructure at huge scale.\n\nNvidia has also used structures called special-purpose vehicles (SPVs) in financing deals. The best-known example is the SPV linked to Elon Musk’s xAI: an entity into which Nvidia invested $2bn, money that will be used to buy Nvidia’s chips.\n\nThis drew comparisons with Enron, which used SPVs to keep debts and toxic assets off its balance sheets, convincing investors and creditors that it was stable while concealing ballooning liabilities.\n\nNvidia has also strongly denied that it is like Enron: in the same leaked memo where it discussed Lucent, it said its reporting was “complete and transparent” and “unlike Enron” it “does not use special-purpose entities to hide debt and inflate revenue”.\n\nThe journalist Ed Zitron, a noted sceptic of the AI boom, agrees that Nvidia is not like either company. Unlike Lucent, it does not appear to be taking on a great deal of debt to finance its circular deals, he says, and most of the customers it is supporting are not as obviously risky as Lucent’s dotcom bubble partners. And it isn’t like Enron, Zitron argues, because it’s being fairly transparent about its own complex, off-balance sheet deals.\n\nSo what could warrant a comparison? Nvidia “is not hiding debt, but it is leaning heavily on vendor-financed demand, which creates exposure if AI growth slows,” says Charlie Dai, an analyst at the research firm Forrester. “The concern is about sustainability, not legality.”\n\nEssentially, whether Nvidia is able to stick the landing depends on whether AI really takes off, generating billions for its corporate users and putting companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and CoreWeave – Nvidia’s customers – firmly in the black, and able to keep buying its systems. That possibility alone is debatable. If this does not happen, says Dai, Nvidia “could face write-downs on equity stakes and unpaid receivables”: meaning, it could lose a lot of money and its stock price could then tank.\n\nApproached for comment, an Nvidia spokesperson referred the Guardian to remarks its chief financial officer, Colette Kress, made to investors in early December. Kress said they were not seeing an AI bubble, instead gesturing at trillions of dollars of business that lie ahead for Nvidia in the next decade.\n\nIn particular, Kress argued that Nvidia’s recent – massive – deals are just the start for the company, and the real money will be made in the coming years, largely through replacing almost all the chips in existing datacentres with its products.\n\nThere is another complexity, which is that Nvidia’s health – and therefore the health of the entire global economy – also depends on whether AI takes off in time for Nvidia and its customers to service the debt from their huge datacentre buildouts and significant capital expenditures.\n\nAdd to this a final category of concern: recent, big-ticket deals with countries such as South Korea and Saudi Arabia, worth multiple billions of dollars, whose terms are opaque. In October, Nvidia said that it would supply 260,000 of its Blackwell chips to South Korea’s government and South Korean companies. The value of this deal was not disclosed, but is estimated to be in the billions.\n\nLikewise with Saudi Arabia. Its government-owned AI startup, Humain, has committed to deploying up to 600,000 Nvidia chips: when that deployment will involve actual purchases, and at what price, is again undisclosed. Nvidia has a number of other strategic partnerships like this – with Italy, with the French AI champion Mistral and with Deutsche Telekom, for example – all involving thousands of chips and unknown sums.\n\nGovernments are likely to pay. There’s nothing circular about a sovereign partnership with Germany. But the deals mean more – quite large – uncertainties nested within a straining web of commitments that require massive capital outlay, and rely on ambitious assumptions about the economy undergoing a revolution in the next years.\n\n“They concentrate risk in a few big customers,” says Dai. “If execution delays occur, Nvidia’s revenue recognition and cashflow could be affected.”",

    "title": "Solid-state batteries charge faster, last longer: review",
    "description": "Solid-state batteries are poised to transform everything from electric cars to consumer electronics, and represent a transformational leap in energy storage.",
    "fullText": "Solid-state batteries charge in a fraction of the time, run cooler, and pack more energy into less space than traditional lithium-ion versions.\n\nA new review from the University of California, Riverside, published in Nano Energy, explains why this technology is poised to transform everything from electric cars to consumer electronics, and represents a major leap in energy storage.\n\nThese batteries replace the flammable liquid found in standard versions with a solid material that is safer and far more efficient. Where today’s batteries may take 30 to 45 minutes to reach 80% charge, solid-state models can cut that time to 12 minutes, and in some cases, as little as three.\n\nLead author Cengiz Ozkan, a professor of mechanical engineering at UCR, said the benefits come down to chemistry and engineering. “By removing the liquid and using stable solid materials instead, we can safely push more electricity into the battery at once, without the risks of overheating or fires,” he said.\n\nConventional lithium-ion batteries move lithium ions, the particles that carry electric charge, through a liquid. But that liquid can degrade over time, limit charging speed, and pose fire risks. Solid-state batteries use a solid material instead, which offers a safer and more stable environment for lithium ions to move through. This enables faster, more efficient charging with fewer safety concerns.\n\nThe solid inside these batteries is known as a solid-state electrolyte. The review highlights three main types: sulfide-based, oxide-based, and polymer-based. Each type has strengths: some allow ions to move faster, others offer better long-term stability or are easier to manufacture. One standout group, sulfide-based electrolytes, performs almost as well as the liquid in current batteries, but without the downsides.\n\nThe researchers also describe the tools scientists now use to watch batteries work in real time. Techniques like neutron imaging and high-powered X-rays let researchers see how lithium moves inside a battery as it charges and discharges. This helps identify areas where the lithium gets stuck or where unwanted structures called “dendrites” start to grow. Dendrites are tiny, needle-like formations that can cause a battery to short-circuit or fail.\n\nUnderstanding these inner workings is key to making better batteries. “These imaging tools are like an MRI for batteries,” Ozkan said. “They let us watch the battery’s vital signs and make smarter design choices.”\n\nSolid-state batteries also tend to use lithium more efficiently. Many designs feature a lithium metal layer that can store more energy in less space than the graphite layers used in current batteries. This means solid-state batteries can be lighter and smaller while still powering devices for just as long, or longer.\n\nWhile conventional lithium-ion batteries typically begin to show noticeable degradation after approximately 5–8 years of use in electric vehicles, solid-state batteries could remain functional for 15–20 years or more, depending on usage and environmental factors.\n\n“Traditional lithium-ion batteries, while revolutionary, are reaching their performance and safety limits as electric vehicles, renewable energy grids, portable electronics, and aerospace systems become more widespread and demanding,” Ozkan said.\n\nOzkan said solid-state batteries could also play a pivotal role in the future of interstellar travel and space exploration.\n\nDue to their thermal and chemical stability, these batteries are better suited to withstand extreme temperatures and radiation conditions in outer space. They’re also able to store more power in less space, which is critical for missions where every cubic centimeter counts. And without liquid electrolytes, they would be more reliable in closed, oxygen-controlled environments like spacecraft or planetary bases.\n\nThe researchers’ goal with this review was to guide researchers and technologists in accelerating the development, scalability, and real-world deployment of solid-state systems.\n\nBut challenges remain. Making these batteries on a large scale is still difficult and expensive. The paper offers a roadmap for solving these problems, including developing better materials, refining how the battery parts interact, and improving factory techniques to make production easier.\n\n“Solid-state batteries are moving closer to reality every day,” Ozkan said. “Our review shows how far the science has come and what steps are needed next to make these batteries available for everyday use.”\n\n(Cover image of solid-state batteries: Just_Super/Getty)",

    "fullText": "The U.S. is preparing for a high-risk boarding of a massive oil tanker accused of evading sanctions tied to Venezuela, marking the most dangerous moment yet in Washington's expanding maritime crackdown. Officials say the vessel ignored U.S. orders, reversed course at sea, and is now being pursued as elite forces move into position, according to a new report.\n\nThe standoff centers on the Bella 1, an oil tanker far larger than any Coast Guard ship, now more than five days into an active pursuit in the Atlantic. According to U.S. officials cited by The Wall Street Journal, the ship refused to stop for boarding, executed a sudden U-turn, and sped away from Venezuelan waters, forcing U.S. forces to regroup.\n\nThe response has escalated quickly. The Coast Guard and U.S. military are assembling additional ships, aircraft, and an elite Maritime Special Response Team trained to board hostile vessels.\n\nU.S. authorities say the Bella 1 is part of a sprawling \"shadow fleet\" used to move sanctioned oil from Venezuela, Iran, and Russia to buyers abroad while masking its origins. The ship has been sanctioned by the Treasury Department for allegedly transporting oil linked to Iranian-backed groups, including Hezbollah and the Houthis, with ties to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nTracking data shows the tanker has repeatedly switched off its transponder, conducted ship-to-ship transfers on the high seas, and falsely claimed foreign registration - all hallmarks of sanction-evasion tactics.\n\nU.S. officials say the ship's behavior is unusual. Most commercial crews comply quickly when confronted by U.S. forces. \"They're probably getting orders from somewhere,\" one former Coast Guard legal chief told the Journal.\n\nThe Bella 1 pursuit comes as the U.S. intensifies pressure on Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, whom the Trump administration accuses of using oil revenue to fund criminal networks and destabilize the region. Maduro denies the allegations and has accused Washington of piracy.\n\nSince December 10, the U.S. has already seized two other tankers carrying Venezuelan oil. Unlike the Bella 1, neither resisted. One of those vessels, carrying roughly two million barrels of crude, is now being escorted to U.S. waters, where officials say the oil will be offloaded.\n\nOfficials tell the Journal there is no rush to board the Bella 1. The tanker is slow, closely tracked, and cannot outrun U.S. forces. That has allowed time to assemble the right personnel, including captains certified to operate a vessel nearly three football fields long.\n\nUnder international law, U.S. forces can escalate gradually, starting with warnings and potentially moving to warning shots before a forced boarding. If seized, the Bella 1 would follow the same path as previous captures: escorted to U.S. ports, its cargo confiscated.\n\nThe post Tanker defies Coast Guard as US escalates Venezuela oil blockade appeared first on Straight Arrow News.\n\nCoast Guard pursuing third oil tanker near Venezuela: reports\n\nVenezuela denounces US oil tanker seizure as &#8216;barefaced robbery&#8217;\n\nVenezuela escorts oil ships amid heightened US military readiness",

    "description": "“Consumers are just in this, whatever the highest price is, is the price they're going to focus on,” Harvard professor Jason Furman said.",
    "fullText": "As President Donald Trump struggles to address Americans’ growing affordability concerns, he has gotten some sympathy from one of former President Barack Obama’s former top economists.\n\nJason Furman, Harvard Kennedy School of Government professor and former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under Obama, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Wednesday pessimistic consumers have overlooked gas prices that have remained affordable, making Trump’s job of addressing the affordability crisis more challenging.\n\nGas prices in December marked the lowest they’ve been all year, according to data from motor club AAA, with unleaded gasoline $0.18 cheaper nationally this year compared to last. National average prices reached their cheapest on Monday, hitting $2.85 a gallon. That hasn’t stopped consumer confidence falling to its lowest level since April, and approval ratings indicating more Americans disagree with how Trump is handling the economy.\n\n“I’ve been puzzled,” Furman said. “When you’re in government, you’re told, politically, the one price that matters is the price of gasoline. That’s the one price that’s been great this year. And I sort of feel a tiny bit bad for President Trump that he doesn’t get any credit for that.”\n\nTrump has continued to offer his own mixed signals on the affordability crisis, including saying in a primetime address last week he inherited an economic “mess” from the Biden administration, offering to cut checks for millions of military personnel for housing supplements, while simultaneously calling the economy the strongest it’s been.\n\nAccording to Furman, Trump also has a bit of a tough crowd: Consumers have been concerned about inflation and the price of groceries, which have increased nearly 30% over the past five years, making it more difficult to assuage economic anxieties, even when there are other optimistic signals.\n\n“Consumers are just in this sort of, whatever the highest price is, is the price they’re going to focus on and be upset about,” he said. “And that’s a really hard problem to solve economically or politically.”\n\nConflicting economic indicators extend beyond prices, Furman said. The U.S. saw its strongest economic growth in two years last quarter with a 4.3% GDP growth, exceeding past analysts’ estimates. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate creeped up to 4.6% in November, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, markedly higher than last November’s 4.2% and above 4%, which is considered reasonable.",

    "description": "Researchers from University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland VA showed restoring the brain’s energy balance led to both pathological and functional recovery.",
    "fullText": "Dr. Andrew Pieper, senior author of the study.\n\nCLEVELAND – For over a century, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been considered irreversible. Consequently, research has focused on disease prevention or slowing, rather than recovery. Despite billions of dollars spent on decades of research, there has never been a clinical trial of a drug for AD with an outcome goal of reversing disease and recovering function.\n\nNow, a research team from University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University, and the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center has challenged this long-held dogma in the field. They tested whether brains already badly afflicted with advanced AD could recover.\n\nThe study, led by Kalyani Chaubey, PhD, from the Pieper Laboratory, published today in Cell Reports Medicine. Through studying diverse preclinical mouse models and human AD brains, the team showed that the brain’s failure to maintain normal levels of a central cellular energy molecule, NAD+, is a major driver of AD, and that maintaining proper NAD+ balance can prevent and even reverse the disease.\n\nNAD+ levels decline naturally across the body, including the brain, as people age. Without proper NAD+ balance, cells eventually become unable to execute critical processes required for proper functioning and survival. In this study, the team showed that the decline in NAD+ is even more severe in the brains of people with AD, and that this also occurs in mouse models of the disease.\n\nWhile AD is a uniquely human condition, it can be studied in the laboratory with mice that have been engineered to express genetic mutations that cause AD in people. The researchers used two of these models. One line of mice carried multiple human mutations in amyloid processing, and the other mouse line carried a human mutation in the tau protein. Amyloid and tau pathology are two of the major early events in AD, and both lines of mice develop brain pathology resembling AD, including blood-brain barrier deterioration, axonal degeneration, neuroinflammation, impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, reduced synaptic transmission, and widespread accumulation of oxidative damage. These mice also develop severe cognitive impairments that resemble what is seen in people with AD.\n\nAfter finding that NAD+ levels in the brain declined precipitously in both human and mouse AD, the research team tested whether preventing the loss of brain NAD+ balance before disease onset, or restoring brain NAD+ balance after significant disease progression, could prevent or reverse AD, respectively. The study was based on their previous work, published in Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences USA, showing that restoring the brain's NAD+ balance achieved pathological and functional recovery after severe, long-lasting traumatic brain injury. They restored NAD+ balance by administering a now well-characterized pharmacologic agent known as P7C3-A20, developed in the Pieper lab.\n\nRemarkably, not only did preserving NAD+ balance protect mice from developing AD, but delayed treatment in mice with advanced disease also enabled the brain to fix the major pathological events caused by the genetic mutations. Moreover, both lines of mice fully recovered cognitive function. This was accompanied by normalized blood levels of phosphorylated tau 217, a recently approved clinical biomarker of AD in people, providing confirmation of disease reversal and highlighting a potential biomarker for future clinical trials.\n\n“We were very excited and encouraged by our results,” said Andrew A. Pieper, MD, PhD, senior author of the study and Director of the Brain Health Medicines Center, Harrington Discovery Institute at UH. “Restoring the brain's energy balance achieved pathological and functional recovery in both lines of mice with advanced Alzheimer's. Seeing this effect in two very different animal models, each driven by different genetic causes, strengthens the idea that restoring the brain’s NAD+ balance might help patients recover from Alzheimer’s.”\n\nDr. Pieper also holds the Morley-Mather Chair in Neuropsychiatry at UH and the CWRU Rebecca E. Barchas, MD, DLFAPA, University Professorship in Translational Psychiatry. He serves as Psychiatrist and Investigator in the Louis Stokes VA Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center (GRECC).\n\nThe results prompt a paradigm shift in how researchers, clinicians, and patients can think about treating AD in the future. “The key takeaway is a message of hope – the effects of Alzheimer's disease may not be inevitably permanent,” said Dr. Pieper. “The damaged brain can, under some conditions, repair itself and regain function.”\n\nDr. Chaubey further explained, “Through our study, we demonstrated one drug-based way to accomplish this in animal models, and also identified candidate proteins in the human AD brain that may relate to the ability to reverse AD.”\n\nDr. Pieper emphasized that currently available over the counter NAD+-precursors have been shown in animal models to raise cellular NAD+ to dangerously high levels that promote cancer The approach in this study, however, uses a pharmacologic agent (P7C3-A20) that enables cells to maintain their proper balance of NAD+ under conditions of otherwise overwhelming stress, without elevating NAD+ to supraphysiologic levels.\n\n“This is important when considering patient care, and clinicians should consider the possibility that therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring brain energy balance might offer a path to disease recovery,” said Dr. Pieper.\n\nThis work also encourages new research into complementary approaches and eventual testing in patients, and the technology is being commercialized by Cleveland-based company Glengary Brain Health, co-founded by Dr. Pieper.\n\n“This new therapeutic approach to recovery needs to be moved into carefully designed human clinical trials to determine whether the efficacy seen in animal models translates to human patients,” Dr. Pieper explained. “Additional next steps for the laboratory research include pinpointing which aspects of brain energy balance are most important for recovery, identifying and evaluating complementary approaches to Alzheimer's reversal, and investigating whether this recovery approach is also effective in other forms of chronic, age-related neurodegenerative disease.”\n\nChaubey, Kalyani et al. “Pharmacologic reversal of Alzheimer’s disease in mice reveals potential therapeutic nodes in human brain.” Cell Reports Medicine. DOI: 10.1016/j.xcrm.2025.102535\n\nTags:\r\n Alzheimer's Disease, Aging",

He began taking it in the hopes of accelerating his recovery after suffering a soccer injury.\n\nBut one constant in his health routine is much simpler: a daily smoothie.\n\nAs his first meal of the day, it packs in 50 grams of protein and 20 grams of fiber in 400 total calories.\n\nThe recipe includes fruit rich in antioxidants, plant-based compounds that research suggests help mitigate the cellular damage of aging. It also helps him get enough fiber, a crucial nutrient for gut health. Fiber helps nourish the microbiome in a way that may help prevent illnesses like heart disease and cancer as we age.\n\nCombined with protein (the primary building block for muscle), fiber helps improve fullness after eating and supports balanced blood sugar.\n\nMarchione's full \"smoothie stack,\" which he published on his website for other people to try, includes ingredients for gut health and energy, like:\n\nThis is a very high protein smoothie. The sweet spot for total daily protein intake to build muscle is about 0.7 grams per pound of body weight daily, studies suggest. For a 140-pound person, a single serving of Marchione's smoothie would be more than half the recommended amount in that range.\n\nIf he's loading up on extra protein in the smoothie, he adds digestive enzymes to make the protein easier to absorb.\n\n\"I find that if I don't do this, I have brain fog from too much protein at once,\" he wrote on his website.",

Some union leaders said they would go along with the elimination of the subsidies, which had been in place for almost two decades.\n\nBolivia's centrist President Rodrigo Paz, who took office on Nov. 8, ended the fuel subsidy that previous left-wing governments had maintained for more than 20 years, keeping gas prices at $0.53 per liter. An emergency decree by Paz last week put the price of gasoline at around $1 per liter.\n\n“The country is sick and must be healed,” Paz said on Sunday in a town hall meeting that was broadcast on state television.\n\n“Every day, $10 million is spent on a subsidy that benefits smugglers” who resell the subsidized fuel in Bolivia and abroad, Paz added.\n\nBusiness groups in Bolivia have backed Paz’s new economic measures, which are expected to ease dollar shortages and make it easier for companies to import goods and capital.\n\n“We knew that at some point the subsidies would end” said Luis Paco, a union leader representing merchants in the city of El Alto. “There were no negotiations over the new adjustments, but we knew this was inevitable.”\n\nBus drivers unions stayed away from Monday’s protests after Bolivia’s government said they will be able to import auto parts duty-free. Paz has also mandated a 20% increase in the minimum wage.\n\nImports of gasoline and diesel — costing the government up to $3 billion a year — had depleted foreign currency reserves and worsened Bolivia's biggest economic crisis in four decades, following the decline of the nation’s natural gas exports.\n\nBut unions that have traditionally aligned with left-wing political leaders — including those representing miners and coca growers — went on strike on Monday, demanding that fuel subsidies be reinstated.\n\nLa Paz police sealed off access to the central square where the palace housing the government is located, to prevent demonstrators from entering.\n\nIn the neighboring city of El Alto, local councils blocked some avenues. There were also road blocks on highways in six of the country’s nine regions, according to Bolivia’s highway administration agency.\n\n“We are in the streets in a struggle that will continue until that decree eliminating the subsidy is repealed,” mining leader Andrés Paye told reporters. “This government approves regulations to favor business owners and punish the poor.”\n\nUnions aligned with former President Evo Morales, led a massive march in Cochabamba, the Andean country’s third-largest city, and blocked two major highways in the east of the country.\n\nThe bus drivers unions did not join the strike, after negotiating over the weekend with Paz's new government.\n\n“We will continue to work, to serve the people” said Lucio Gomez, a leader of a transport workers union.\n\nCarlos Cordero, a political science professor in La Paz, said the union behind the strike was trying to “show its strength” ahead of next year's elections for governors and mayors. But the relatively low turnout on Monday showed that the union has been weakened, he said.\n\n“In many sectors of the country, there is a conviction that the adjustment was necessary” Cordero said.",

    "fullText": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump is gathering with top national security officials on Monday, a meeting that comes as the U.S. Coast Guard steps up efforts to interdict oil tankers in the Caribbean Sea as part of the Republican administration's escalating pressure campaign on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's government.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Navy Secretary John Phelan are scheduled to join Trump, who is vacationing at his Mar-a-Lago resort, for what the White House called a \"major announcement.\" Trump plans to discuss a shipbuilding initiative at the event, according to a White House official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nBut Trump's gathering of key members of his national security team also comes at yet another inflection point in Trump's four-month pressure campaign on the Maduro government, which began with the stated purpose of stemming the flow of illegal drugs from the South American nation but has developed into something more amorphous.\n\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry has started evacuating the families of diplomats from Venezuela, according to a European intelligence official speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information.\n\nThe official told The Associated Press the evacuations include women and children and began on Friday. The official said Russian Foreign Ministry officials are assessing the situation in Venezuela in “very grim tones.” The White House and Kremlin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn the Caribbean, the U.S. Coast Guard on Monday continued for the second day to chase a sanctioned oil tanker that the Trump administration describes as part of a “dark fleet” Venezuela is using to evade U.S. sanctions. The tanker, the official added, is flying under a false flag and is under a U.S. judicial seizure order.\n\nIt is the third ship pursued by the Coast Guard, which on Saturday seized a Panama-flagged vessel called Centuries that U.S. officials said was part of the Venezuelan shadow fleet.\n\nThe Coast Guard, with assistance from the Navy, seized a sanctioned tanker called Skipper on Dec. 10, also part of the shadow fleet of tankers that the U.S. says operates on the fringes of the law to move sanctioned cargo. That ship was registered in Panama.\n\nTrump, after that first seizure, said the U.S. would carry out a “blockade” of Venezuela. Trump has repeatedly said that Maduro's days in power are numbered.\n\nLast week, Trump demanded that Venezuela return assets that it seized from U.S. oil companies years ago, justifying anew his announcement of a “blockade” against sanctioned oil tankers traveling to or from the South American country.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose agency oversees the Coast Guard, said in a Monday appearance on “Fox & Friends” that the targeting of tankers is intended to send “a message around the world that the illegal activity that Maduro is participating in cannot stand, he needs to be gone, and that we will stand up for our people.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Defense Department, under Trump's orders, continues its campaign of attacks on smaller vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean that it alleges are carrying drugs to the United States and beyond.\n\nAt least 104 people have been killed in 28 known strikes since early September. The strikes have faced scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and human rights activists, who say the administration has offered scant evidence that its targets are indeed drug smugglers and that the fatal strikes amount to extrajudicial killings.",

    "description": "Scientists have imaged heat traveling as a wave, called \"second sound,\" in superfluid quantum gas. It may unlock mysteries of neutron stars and superconductors.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nUsually, when something gets warmed up, heat tends to spread outward before eventually dissipating. But things are a little different in the world of superfluid quantum gas.\n\nFor the first time, MIT scientists have successfully imaged how heat actually travels in a wave, known as a “second sound,” through this exotic fluid.\n\nUnderstanding this dynamic could help answer questions about high-temperature superconductors and neutron stars.\n\nIn the world of average, everyday materials, heat tends to spread out from a localized source. Drop a burning coal into a pot of water, and that liquid will slowly rise in temperature before its heat eventually dissipates. But the world is full of rare, exotic materials that don’t exactly play by these thermal rules.\n\nInstead of spreading out as one would expect, these superfluid quantum gasses “slosh” heat side to side—it essentially propagates as a wave. Scientists call this behavior a material’s “second sound” (the first being ordinary sound via a density wave). Although this phenomenon has been observed before, it’s never been imaged. But recently, scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) were finally able to capture this movement of pure heat by developing a new method of thermography (a.k.a. heat-mapping).\n\nThe results of this study were published in the journal Science, and in an university press release highlighting the achievement, MIT assistant professor and co-author Richard Fletcher continued the boiling pot analogy to describe the inherent strangeness of “second sound” in these exotic superfluids.\n\n“It’s as if you had a tank of water and made one half nearly boiling,” Fletcher said. “If you then watched, the water itself might look totally calm, but suddenly the other side is hot, and then the other side is hot, and the heat goes back and forth, while the water looks totally still.”\n\nThese superfluids are created when a cloud of atoms is subjected to ultra-cold temperatures approaching absolute zero (−459.67 °F). In this rare state, atoms behave differently, as they create an essentially friction-free fluid. It’s in this frictionless state that heat has been theorized to propagate like a wave.\n\n“Second sound is the hallmark of superfluidity, but in ultracold gases so far you could only see it in this faint reflection of the density ripples that go along with it,” lead author Martin Zwierlein said in a press statement. “The character of the heat wave could not be proven before.”\n\nTo finally capture this second sound in action, Zweierlein and his team had to think outside the usual thermal box, as there’s a big problem trying to track heat of an ultracold object—it doesn’t emit the usual infrared radiation. So, MIT scientists designed a way to leverage radio frequencies to track certain subatomic particles known as “lithium-6 fermions,” which can be captured via different frequencies in relation to their temperature (i.e. warmer temperatures mean higher frequencies, and vice versa). This novel technique allowed the researchers to essentially zero in on the “hotter” frequencies (which were still very much cold) and track the resulting second wave over time.\n\nThis might feel like a big “so what?” After all, when’s the last time you had a close encounter with a superfluid quantum gas? But ask a materials scientist or astronomer, and you’ll get an entirely different answer.\n\nWhile exotic superfluids may not fill up our lives (yet), understanding the properties of second wave movement could help questions regarding high-temperature superconductors (again, still at very low temperatures) or the messy physics that lie at the heart of neutron stars.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Japanese authorities have approved a decision to restart the world’s biggest nuclear power plant, which has sat dormant for more than a decade following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, in a pivotal moment as the country looks to looks to shift its energy supply away from fossil fuels.\n\nDespite nerves from many local residents, the Niigata prefectural assembly, home to the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant, approved a bill on Monday that clears the way for utility company Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) to restart one of the plant’s seven reactors.\n\nThe company plans to bring the No. 6 reactor back online around January 20, Japan’s public broadcaster NHK reported.\n\nJapan has taken a cautious approach to nuclear energy since a massive 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami in 2011 triggered a nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. It was the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.\n\nFollowing the disaster, Japan shut down all 54 of its nuclear power stations including Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, which sits in the coastal and port region of Niigata about 320 kilometers (200 miles) north of Tokyo on Japan’s main island of Honshu.\n\nJapan has since restarted 14 of the 33 nuclear reactors that remain operable, according to the World Nuclear Association.\n\nThe Niigata plant will be the first to reopen under the operation of TEPCO, the company that ran the Fukushima Daiichi power station. It has been trying to reassure residents of the restart plan is safe.\n\n“We remain firmly committed to never repeating such an accident and ensuring Niigata residents never experience anything similar,” said TEPCO spokesperson Masakatsu Takata, Reuters news agency reported.\n\nBefore the Fukushima disaster, Japan’s nuclear reactors had provided around 30% of the country’s electricity. Since then, Japan has increased its reliance on costly imported fossil fuels, including coal and gas, to power the country and keep the lights on.\n\nAbout 60–70% of Japan’s power generation comes from imported fossil fuels, which cost the country about 10.7 trillion yen ($68 billion) last year alone.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who took office two months ago, is a strong proponent of nuclear power and has pushed to revive the crippled industry to drive down costs, and tackle inflation and a stagnant economy.\n\nJapan is the world’s fifth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide, after China, the United States, India and Russia, according to the International Energy Agency. But it has committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050, and renewable energy was at the center of its latest energy plan published earlier this year, with a push for greater investments in solar and wind.\n\nThe country’s energy demands are also expected to increase in the coming years due to a boom in energy-hungry data centers that power AI infrastructure.\n\nTo achieve its energy and climate goals, Japan aims to double the share of nuclear power in its electricity mix to 20% by 2040.\n\nBut the memory of the Fukushima disaster endures, and some local residents are wary of reviving nuclear power due to safety concerns.\n\n“We know firsthand the risk of a nuclear accident and cannot dismiss it,” Ayako Oga, 52, told Reuters. Oga had settled in Niigata after fleeing the Fukushima disaster. She told the news agency that her old home was inside the exclusion zone and she still struggles with post-traumatic stress-like symptoms.\n\nA survey published by the Niigata prefecture in October found 60% of residents did not think conditions for the restart had been met. Nearly 70% were worried about TEPCO operating the plant, Reuters reported.\n\nOn its website, TEPCO said Kashiwazaki-Kariwa had undergone multiple inspections and upgrades and that the company had learned “the lessons of Fukushima.”\n\nThe company said new seawalls and watertight doors would provide “stronger protection against tsunamis” and that mobile generators and more fire trucks would be on hand for “cooling support” in an emergency. It also said the plant now had “upgraded filtering systems designed to control the spread of radioactive materials.”\n\nIn late October, TEPCO conducted “a full round of integrity checks” at Unit 6 and declared the reactor fit for startup.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Dec 22 (Reuters) - A revamp of China's electricity market is boosting the economics of storing power just as international demand surges, sparking a boom for the Chinese energy storage manufacturers that already dominate globally.\n\nChinese firms are on track for a 75% jump this year in global shipments of lithium-ion battery cells for energy storage, ​according to one estimate.\n\nThey have exported more than $65 billion worth of storage and electric-vehicle batteries this year, cementing their dominance in a sector vital to backing up wind and solar ‌and keeping power coursing through artificial-intelligence data centres.\n\nThe surge in sales is driven by data centres and renewables domestically, as well as by Chinese reforms and subsidies that are boosting general demand for energy storage. International demand is rising in tandem with the ‌surging growth in data centres, a need to back up Europe's ageing grid and China's burgeoning renewable energy business in the Middle East, analysts say.\n\n\"These leading energy storage cell makers, they have full orders. Many of them are basically working double shifts now to try and meet demand,\" said analyst Cosimo Ries at policy research firm Trivium China. The boom \"is one of the biggest surprises of the year, I think, in China's energy space.\"\n\nUBS last month raised its 2026 forecast for global battery-energy storage installations by 25%.\n\nThe International Energy Agency forecasts global investment in battery storage facilities will rise 16% this year to $66 billion. Much of that is ⁠set to be captured by Chinese firms because while Tesla is number ‌one in energy storage systems, China dominates production of the tiny cells inside them.\n\nAll of the six top global cell suppliers - Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL), HiTHIUM, EVE Energy, BYD, CALB and REPT BATTERO - are Chinese, according to a January-to-September ranking by consultancy Infolink. Of the top 10, only Japan's AESC is not from China.\n\nEVE's ‍energy storage sales volumes rose 35.51% in the first three quarters from the same period last year. REPT BATTERO's third-quarter shipments of all batteries set a record high. Top EV players CATL and BYD did not break out energy storage shipments through the third quarter. Storage has historically made up less of their revenue than automotive batteries and EVs, although the proportion is growing.\n\n\"Pairing solar with storage has effectively become the only solution for meeting U.S. AI ​data-centre power needs,\" UBS analyst Yishu Yan told a media briefing. \"U.S. AI data centre power demand is very robust, but power is the biggest bottleneck, and U.S. baseload power - gas, nuclear, thermal - they ‌won't grow much in the next five years.\"",

    "description": "The story behind Wales-based Wunda Group, which designs and supplies energy-efficient underfloor heating systems.",
    "fullText": "When entrepreneurs Charles and Josephine Pugh rented a property with \"uncomfortable and uncontrollable\" underfloor heating (UFH), it sparked a move away from the made-to-order furniture world they had been invested in since the late 1970s.\n\nThe couple, who had founded British retailer Multiyork in 1978, set up Wunda Group in 2006 at the height of the 'green homes revolution' when barn conversions and self-builds were de rigueur.\n\nThe Pughs’ home heating issue had centred on underfloor screed — a level layer of concrete where piping has traditionally been embedded into — with pipe centres too far apart. With no controls, there was a slow response time to heat and the floor became too hot. The Pughs thought the existing systems were \"slow and antiquated\".\n\nMonmouthshire-based Wunda now designs and supplies energy-efficient UFH systems and has cut through to the DIY consumer at a time of rising energy bills. The company employs 90 staff and says it has booked over £10m in sales this year.\n\nThe heating firm is also a family affair. With Charles as CEO and Josephine CFO, their daughter Josephine is managing director, while grandson Sam Jump is currently head of business development.\n\nThe business took off in 2008 when Wunda reorientated as installers looked for kits and components after the self-build market collapsed.\n\nIn 2010, their former base near Chepstow was in an old chicken farm shed renovated to offices. The Pughs still visited trade shows and had come across one American exhibitor’s aluminum chip board panel with grooves, which was employed as a last fix in the build.\n\nThey pioneered a version with high-compressed polystyrene and put a sample down in the chicken shed, with a heat pump which moved outside thermal energy internally. The closer piping also meant it could be run at lower temperatures.\n\nJump, who was working in the warehouse at the time and previously led a team of outreachers offering membership, recalled: “Everyone was walking around in T-shirts during winter and the response rate was unreal, the heat pump was operating at the optimum flow temperature with a co-efficient performance.”\n\nHowever, their product was initially met with scepticism from installers unwilling to test new products. “Where most people think of UFH as this uncomfortable system, we now have a rapid response system and it warms up as fast as radiators, if not quicker.”\n\nA booming DIY industry, renovating homes or building extensions instead of moving, has helped boost Wunda’s profits.",

    "title": "The evolution of expendability: Why some ants traded armor for numbers",
    "description": "Ants with lots of workers tend to put less energy into making them armored.",
    "fullText": "The trade-off between quality and quantity is a fundamental economic dilemma. Now, a team of British, American, and Japanese researchers describes how it applies to biology, as well. They have discovered that this dilemma most likely shaped the evolutionary trajectory of ants, one of Earth’s most successful groups of organisms.\n\nTheir study reveals that, as ant societies grew in complexity and numbers, they didn’t just make their workers smaller—they also made them cheaper.\n\nIn the insect world, the exoskeleton known as the cuticle serves as a protective barrier against predators, pathogens, and desiccation, while providing the structural framework for muscle attachment. But this protection comes at a price. Building a robust cuticle requires significant amounts of nitrogen and rare minerals like zinc and manganese. While skimping on armor for an individual insect may be a death sentence, the evolution of ants apparently found a way around it.\n\n“There’s this question in biology of what happens to individuals as societies they are in get more complex?” said Evan Economo, an entomologist at the University of Maryland and co-author of the study. “For example, the individuals may themselves become simpler because tasks that a solitary organism would need to complete can be handled by a collective.”\n\nEconomo’s team hypothesized that the metabolic balance behind investing in cuticles in social insects like ants could favor the collective over the individual. The idea was that a colony of 10,000 workers could lose a few individuals to a predator without much consequence, so investing heavily in each worker’s defenses would seem like a waste of precious nutrients. To test this hypothesis, they examined whether ant lineages that maintain massive, specialized workforces reduce the investment in their individual workers’ exoskeletons.\n\nTo test this idea, the researchers needed to pull off a comparative study on the anatomy of ants at an unprecedented scale. “We worked with scans of ant specimens and species from all over the world to capture the global diversity of ants,” Economo says. The team used a massive database called Antscan, which contains three-dimensional X-ray microtomography imaging of ants from around the globe.\n\nMicrotomography works similarly to medical CT scans, but at a vastly higher resolution. Still, on its own, the technique could only generate lots of precise data—it still had to be interpreted. Parsing through 3D imagery of over 880 specimens, including workers, queens, and males belonging to over 500 different species, was another challenge. “The 3D scanning itself is a very advanced technology,” says Arthur Matte, a researcher at the University of Cambridge and lead author of the study. “But once you have the ants in three dimensions, it’s still very hard to segment manually every tissue you’re interested in.”\n\nTo solve this, Matte developed a computer vision algorithm for “unsupervised segmentation.” Because the cuticle is always the outermost tissue of an arthropod, the algorithm could automatically identify and measure the volume of the exoskeleton across all ants in the dataset.\n\nThe first thing scientists noticed when the results poured in was that cuticle investment varied wildly, ranging from 6 percent to 35 percent of an ant’s total body volume. So, the next thing they focused on was figuring out the reasons behind these variations.\n\nThe team started checking how factors like diet, temperature, humidity, and foraging style correlated with the size of the cuticle. To get a handle on this, segmented 3D scans were fed into evolutionary models. “One of the most insightful things we did was to individually remove such variables from the models to estimate their contributions to the final cuticle investment,” Matte explains. This way, scientists learned that temperature was responsible for just 12 percent of variation in cuticle size and diet—especially its nitrogen content—explained another 37 percent. But the factor that had the strongest impact on the model was the colony size.\n\nAnts that invested less in their cuticle tended to have significantly larger colony sizes. More surprisingly, this reduction in cuticle investment and the resulting increase in colony size appeared to be associated with higher diversification rates. In biological terms, squishier ants could evolve to occupy new niches much faster than their heavily armored cousins. “Requiring less nitrogen could make these ants more versatile and able to conquer new environments,” Matte suggests. This efficiency may have allowed ants to transition from a diet of high-protein prey to more abundant but less nutritious liquid sugar sources, like honeydew or floral nectar.\n\n“Ants reduce per-worker investment in one of the most nutritionally expensive tissues for the good of the collective,” Matte explains. “They’re shifting from self-investment toward a distributed workforce.”\n\nThe researchers think the pattern they observed in ants reflects a more universal trend in the evolution of societal complexity. The transition from solitary life to complex societies echoes the transition from single-celled organisms to multicellular ones.\n\nIn a single-celled organism, a cell must be a “jack-of-all-trades,” performing every function necessary for survival. In a multicellular animal, however, individual cells often become simpler and more specialized, relying on the collective for protection and resources.\n\n“It’s a pattern that echoes the evolution of multicellularity, where cooperative units can be individually simpler than a solitary cell, yet collectively capable of far greater complexity,” says Matte. Still, the question of whether underinvesting in individuals to boost the collective makes sense for creatures other than ants remains open, and it most likely isn’t as much about nutritional economics as it is about sex.\n\nThe study focused on ants that already have a reproductive division of labor, one where workers do not reproduce. This social structure is likely the key prerequisite for the cheap worker strategy. For the team, this is the reason we haven’t, at least so far, found similar evolutionary patterns in more complex social organisms like wolves, which live in packs—or humans with their amazingly complex societies. Wolves and people are both social, but maintain a high degree of individual self-interest regarding reproduction. Ant workers could be made expendable because they don’t pass their own genes—they are essentially extensions of the queen’s reproductive strategy.\n\nBefore looking for signs of ant-like approaches to quality versus quantity dilemmas in other species, the team wants to take an even closer look at ants. Economo, Matte, and their colleagues seek to expand their analysis to other ant tissues, such as the nervous system and muscles, to see if the cheapening of individuals extends beyond the exoskeleton. They are also looking at ant genomes to see what genetic innovations allowed for the shift from quality to quantity.  “We still need a lot of work to understand ants’ evolution,” Matte says.\n\nScience Advances. 2025.

    "description": "Wall Street arrived in Palm Beach early this winter. From Milos to Mary Lou's, these restaurants and nightlife spots are leading the scene.",
    "fullText": "Ask me about the ZIP code 33480, and I'll have plenty to say.\n\nIt's Palm Beach, a place I know well. I grew up in South Florida, and even now, I spend a good amount of time here, watching how the island continues to evolve. It also happens to overlap with my job: as a Wall Street reporter, many of the firms we cover — from Goldman Sachs to Citadel — have built out significant \"Wall Street South\" operations in and around Palm Beach County over the past few years.\n\nThis winter, locals tell me the island feels especially busy — noticeably earlier than usual. Restaurants are filling up weeks ahead of the holidays, reservations are disappearing quickly, and the finance crowd is playing a noticeable role, restaurant insiders say.\n\n\"We've never seen the island this full this early in the season,\" Alex Melillo, a partner at Mary Lou's, one of West Palm's newest and hottest nightlife venues, told me.\n\nTo get a broader sense of where people are actually going, I asked around. In addition to speaking with restaurant operators and longtime denizens of \"the Island,\" I checked in with some local contacts in finance: a money manager who works for a large bank and a trusted friend who works in private asset management.\n\nIn my conversations, the same names kept coming up — places where Wall Streeters, finance professionals, and winter visitors congregate when they're here.\n\nI recently had a meal at Buccan and wasn't disappointed. Unlike many popular Palm Beach hot spots that lean old-world, the space feels particularly modern, matching the restaurant's more cosmopolitan approach to dining.\n\nThe menu is built around avant-garde plates meant for sharing, with dishes that change seasonally but often include standouts like hamachi tiradito, inventive crudos, and rich pastas.\n\nWhen I went with a friend, we split the sweet corn agnolotti — and it's an absolute must. The room draws a lively mix of locals and visiting professionals, and it's the kind of place where dinners tend to stretch. Next door is Imoto, Buccan's sister restaurant, a sleek sushi spot if you're craving Japanese.\n\nCucina is often the first stop when my friends and I are looking for a fun night out.\n\nIt's Palm Beach's playground, an island favorite for seeing and being seen — and a place that tends to extend a simple dinner into a much longer affair when the music comes on. Specialized lights illuminate the ceiling in keeping with the DJ's beat. Tables feel like prime real estate, and the room gets even more packed as the evening goes on.\n\nOn busy nights, it's clear this is where a large cross-section of Palm Beach society — including professionals from out of town — has descended. The door can be selective, but once you're inside, the expectation is that you'll stay awhile and dance. I recommend stopping by Lola 41 around the corner for a drink first.\n\nEstiatorio Milos opened earlier this year on the West Palm Beach waterfront, bringing one of the most respected names in Mediterranean seafood to South Florida. The restaurant has the same bright, luminous aesthetic found at other Milos locations — including Hudson Yards — with fresh fish displayed on ice and a glowing bar that makes an ideal backdrop for conversation on a buzzy night.\n\nAside from Avra in Sunny Isles, this may be the best Greek restaurant in South Florida right now. A must-order for the table is the Milos chips — paper-thin zucchini and eggplant, lightly fried and genuinely impossible to resist — alongside simply prepared whole fish grilled with lemon and olive oil.\n\nIf you're craving a taste of Manhattan — or Paris — in Palm Beach, La Goulue has become one of the island's most popular destinations. The South Florida offshoot of the classic Upper East Side French restaurant serves familiar staples like cheese soufflé, lobster bisque, and rich French onion soup, drawing a steady mix of locals and winter visitors.\n\nIt's rarely quiet. \"I was passing by La Goulue the other day, and there wasn't an empty seat,\" said Daphne Nikolopoulos, editor in chief of Palm Beach Illustrated, a popular glossy title in the area. The restaurant has become a dependable choice for everything from long family dinners to client meals — the kind of place finance and business guests return to repeatedly once they're settled in town for the season.\n\nAn Upper East Side mainstay that opened in Palm Beach in 2021, Le Bilboquet has become a dependable stop for winter visitors looking for a taste of home. The French bistro serves its signature dishes — including cajun chicken, tuna tartare, and Dover sole — in a setting that works just as well for long lunches as for leisurely dinners.\n\nThe restaurant has been especially busy this season. \"We're certainly seeing a strong presence from the finance and business community this winter,\" a spokesperson for the restaurant told me. They said they've also seen an increase in group meals and celebrations, \"including more corporate and business dinners, often with groups of eight to 10 guests,\" tied to end-of-year and holiday gatherings.\n\nIf you're interested in a memorable night out, Mary Lou's, which opened this year to much fanfare, is arguably the area's hottest ticket. Inside, you'll find a space that's dark and sultry, anchored by a dramatic chandelier over the bar and a massive disco ball overhead. Visiting celebrities often pass through, tucked into the discrete banquettes along the wall.\n\nMelillo, one of Mary Lou's three partners, said the season has ramped up earlier than usual, driven in large part by visiting finance and corporate guests who are spending longer stretches in Palm Beach and going out more frequently. For Wall Streeters and the local professional crowd, the environment feels inviting but still upscale. Expect to see well-dressed partiers in sport jackets and toasting with free-flowing libations.\n\nJoe Cervasio, the partner who oversees programming, said the venue has leaned into booking touring DJs and festival-level talent as demand has grown.\n\n\"I cannot hold enough champagne — it's literally falling through our fingertips,\" Melillo said.\n\nReservations are strongly recommended.\n\nOne of the most talked-about openings on Palm Beach Island this season is The Polo Room, the new restaurant led by internationally known polo player Nacho Figueras. The menu is inspired by the legendary polo star's Argentinian roots.\n\nNot to be mistaken for an offshoot of a separate restaurant — Ralph Lauren's Polo Bar on 55th Street in Midtown — the space opened in early December and has quickly drawn attention from locals and winter visitors. It features an equestrian aesthetic throughout.\n\n\"Without question, The Polo Room is fantastic,\" said Nikolopoulos, who was one of the new restaurant's first customers. \"Figueras doesn't do anything halfway — he's meticulous and very professional with all his endeavors.\"\n\nShe said the food stood out, pointing to the empanadas and steaks in particular, and noted that Figueras has incorporated family recipes into the menu — like his mom's signature chocolate mousse for dessert.",

    "fullText": "Analysts see ‘global construction frenzy that shows no signs of slowing’ amid surge in demand from AI boom\n\nA new report finds that investment in the worldwide data center market reached $61bn this year, setting a new record atop the wave of the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nThe analysis by S&P Global, first reported by CNBC, documented what the market intelligence firm called a “global construction frenzy that shows no signs of slowing”, to build out the massive real estate, hardware, and energy requirements driven by insatiable demand from AI companies. S&P pegged 2024’s investment in the data center market at $60.8bn, just below the 2025 number.\n\n“Unable to buy, many investors are turning to new builds,” wrote Iuri Struta, an analyst for S&P Global.\n\nThere are approximately 500 data centers in the United Kingdom, compared with about 4,000 in the United States, according to Data Center Map, which tracks the facilities globally.\n\nStruta, the S&P Global analyst, said he does not see the demand for data centers slowing.\n\n“The global data center footprint is projected to expand at a faster rate over the next five years than it did in the previous five, spurred by demand for energy- and computer-intensive AI workloads,” said Struta.\n\nS&P Global’s report comes at a time when some investors worry that the entire artificial intelligence sector may be in the midst of huge overspending for unproven ongoing returns.\n\nLast week, Oracle’s shares dropped 11% after it reported lower quarterly earnings than analysts had expected, which in turn dragged the stock prices on some other major companies in AI. Some companies such as Oracle, along with Nvidia and OpenAI, have been criticized recently for making deals with one another that seem circular to many investors.\n\nEarlier this year, the International Energy Agency noted in a lengthy report that, globally, “electricity demand for data centres more than doubles by 2030”, reaching 945 terawatt hours (TWh), or just more than “Japan’s total electricity consumption today”.\n\nThis month, a trio of analysts from Deutsche Bank put out a staggering chart indicating that OpenAI alone will burn through $143bn between 2024 and 2029, the year before the company claims it will turn a profit. That chart shows how much more the ChatGPT maker, seen as a bellwether of the AI industry, plans to spend relative to other tech giants of the last two decades, including Amazon, Tesla and Uber, reached profitability.\n\n“Of course, OpenAI may continue to attract significant funding and could ultimately develop products that generate substantial profits and revolutionise the world,” Jim Reid, managing director, global head of macro research and thematic strategy at Deutsche Bank, wrote.\n\n“But at present, no startup in history has operated with losses on anything approaching this scale. We are firmly in uncharted territory.”",

    "fullText": "Ukraine’s dramatic escalation of its sea-drone attacks on tankers carrying Russian oil could spread to the English Channel, experts have warned.\n\nThe hit on an Oman-flagged tanker on Friday widened the Ukrainian operation from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, signalling that sanctioned tankers could be hit anywhere on their journey.\n\n“The Ukrainians are now operating across a much wider area. If you’re a shadow fleet vessel then there’s now a risk wherever you are,” said Matthew Wright, of trade intelligence firm Kpler.\n\n“You get shadow fleet vessels that come out of the Baltic Sea, they are essentially going through the North Sea. The threat to them is now higher.”\n\nMichelle Bockmann, from maritime data company Windward, said the Ukrainians were likely to continue focusing on empty tankers rather than those laden with oil, but the attacks could impose massive costs on the vessel operators.\n\nShe added: “Marine insurers have been saying for quite a while now that one of these vessels, if they have a casualty, especially if they go through the English Channel, that they’re a billion-dollar marine accident waiting to happen.\n\n“Ukraine is aware of this risk, and I think that’s why this is a new strategy, an evolving strategy, and definitely one to watch.”\n\nThere are close to 1,000 tankers involved in Russia’s shadow fleet – the vessels, often false-flagged and with obscure ownership, that ferry crude or refined Russian oil to customers primarily in India and China.\n\nAbout 600 carry exclusively Russian oil, which puts them within the Western sanctions net. Roughly another 350 carry Russian oil alongside other cargo.\n\nUkraine has carried out drone attacks on three shadow tankers in the Black Sea in the past month, and is also thought to have been behind an apparent limpet-mine explosion off the coast of Senegal.\n\nExperts said the broadening attacks could prompt some vessel owners to question whether the risk of working for Vladimir Putin was still worth the reward.\n\nThe attacks could drive up ship owners’ insurance premiums. The insurers are believed to be mostly Russian or Chinese, and Kpler said operators might start to worry about whether they would get a payout if attacked.\n\nKpler’s Mr Wright said: “The London insurance market is incredibly well capitalised. It can handle a lot of large claims because the risk is spread. Whereas we don’t have a lot of visibility of how well capitalised the insurers are who cover the Russian shadow fleet.\n\n“If you’re a shadow fleet owner, you’d be asking whether you might get paid out. It will make a lot of the owners who have been leading players in the shadow fleet think about whether the risk-reward is worth it.”\n\nThe vessel owners could react to the bigger risks by raising the prices they charge Russia, further squeezing the Kremlin’s war chest.\n\nUkrainian security sources told local media this calculus made these tankers fair game.\n\n“The aggressor state used this tanker to circumvent sanctions and earn money that was used for the war against Ukraine,” the sources were quoted as saying.\n\n“Therefore ... this is an absolutely legitimate target. The enemy must understand that Ukraine will not stop, and will beat him anywhere in the world.”\n\nThe Ukrainian action underscores the extent to which civilian tankers have become involved in geopolitical conflict and tension this year, with the US also blockading oil-freight traffic around Venezuela.\n\nMs Bockmann said this blurring of the line between the commercial and military domains was making the industry “uneasy”.\n\nArsenio Dominguez, secretary-general of the UN’s International Maritime Organisation, this week urged restraint.\n\n“As the situation continues to escalate in the Black Sea, I call on all parties to refrain from targeting innocent seafarers, port workers and merchant ships,” he said.\n\n“Shipping should not be used as collateral in geopolitical situations and there is an increased environmental risk developing.”\n\nThe Ukrainians appear to be targeting only empty tankers, to avoid triggering an environmental disaster.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "Texas Pacific Land has generated substantial returns for long-term investors as Permian Basin oil and gas production has surged.",
    "fullText": "Texas Pacific Land is a high-margin cash cow.\n\nIts land is valuable because it's located in the largest oil-and-gas-producing region in the United States.\n\nThe company is one of the safest ways to invest in growing oil and gas production.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Texas Pacific Land ›\n\nNetflix captured the spotlight in November when it executed its long-awaited 10-for-1 stock split. With just two weeks left in 2025, many investors probably figure they'll have to wait for 2026 for more high-profile splits.\n\nEarlier this month, S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) component Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE: TPL) announced a 3-for-1 stock split. Trading of the split-adjusted shares will take place on Dec. 23.\n\nHere's why Texas Pacific is no ordinary oil and gas company and why the high-margin cash cow could be an excellent gift for your portfolio this December.\n\nTexas Pacific's stock split will triple the number of shares outstanding while reducing the share price by two-thirds, making it easier for investors to buy one full share of the company at around $280 per share. This compares to around $840 per share at the time of this writing.\n\nStock splits can indicate that management is confident in a company's future earnings growth and thus, a higher future stock price. Even though stock splits don't impact a company's value or market capitalization, they're still generally received favorably by investors.\n\nWhat makes Texas Pacific's split particularly interesting is that the stock is down 24.1% year to date -- but stock splits tend to occur after a stock has run up in price. To make matters even more interesting, the company issued a 3-for-1 stock split in March 2024.\n\nIt's incredibly rare for a company to issue stock splits in back-to-back years, but Texas Pacific more than doubled last year, has crushed the S&P 500 over the last five years, and is up 18-fold over the last decade. There are plenty of reasons to believe it has a long runway for future earnings growth.\n\nThe oil and gas industry is capital-intensive. Upstream exploration and production companies are the most sensitive to fluctuations in oil and gas prices. Midstream companies, which transport and store hydrocarbons, tend to have less price sensitivity due to long-term contracts but are incredibly capital-intensive and depend on growing demand to justify infrastructure spending. Similarly, the margins of downstream refining and marketing companies can fluctuate based on input costs, such as oil prices and the cyclical demand for refined products.",

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's unanimous order is designed to clear up pressing issues around so-called “colocation” agreements in the nation's largest grid territory, which stretches across mid-Atlantic states to parts of Illinois and Indiana.

    "fullText": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Federal regulators will allow tech companies to effectively plug massive data centers directly into power plants, issuing a long-awaited order Thursday, as the Trump administration urges it to help the U.S. lead the world in artificial intelligence and revive domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's unanimous order is designed to clear up pressing issues around so-called “colocation” agreements in the nation's largest grid territory, which stretches across mid-Atlantic states to parts of Illinois and Indiana.\n\nBut it could become a blueprint for how FERC handles an October request from Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, to ensure that data centers and large manufacturers get the power they need as quickly as possible.\n\nIt also comes amid concerns that the mid-Atlantic territory covering some 65 million people will face electricity shortages in the coming years, as the build out of data centers outpaces the speed of new power sources coming online.\n\nLaura Swett, FERC’s chair, told Thursday's meeting that clearing the way for massive energy users — like data centers — to get electricity straight from power plants was a “critical step to give investors and consumers more certainty on how FERC believes we can solve the problem of meeting historic surging demand and realize our greatest potential as a country.”\n\nIt would, she said, also protect regular ratepayers, even as evidence mounts in various states that regular ratepayers are bearing the cost of new power plants and transmission lines to feed energy hungry data centers.\n\nPower plant owners applauded the step, as their share prices rose steeply in Thursday's trading. Advanced Energy United, whose members provide solar and wind power, said the FERC order should help clarify how big power users can set up their own power sources.\n\nThe Edison Electric Institute, which represents for-profit utilities, said only that it would “continue to work” to support rapid data center connection, protect ratepayers from cost-shifts and strengthen the grid for everyone.\n\nJeff Dennis, executive director of the Electricity Customer Alliance, said the order showed that FERC is trying to address looming issues around fast-growing power demand and underscored the urgency to reform grid policy.\n\nThursday's order grew out of a dispute between power plant owners and electric utilities over a proposed colocation deal between Amazon’s cloud-computing subsidiary and the owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.\n\nFor tech giants, such arrangements represent a quick fix to quickly get power while avoiding a potentially longer and more expensive process of hooking into a fraying electric grid that serves everyone else.\n\nBut utilities protested that it allows big power users to avoid paying them to maintain the grid. Some consumer advocates maintained that diverting energy from existing power plants to data centers could drive up energy prices without an answer for how rising power demand will be met for regular ratepayers.\n\nFERC's Thursday order sets up a couple new regulatory tracks.\n\nIt requires the operator of the mid-Atlantic grid, PJM Interconnection, to develop rates and conditions for different colocation scenarios involving new power plants or sources.\n\nThat could mean allowing a big power user to pay for only the transmission services they use, considerably less than they might otherwise pay to connect to the grid through a utility.\n\nThe order also could require a big power user that colocates with an existing power plant to pay the cost to replace the energy that it diverts away from the broader electric grid.\n\nFollow Marc Levy on X at https://x.com/timelywriter.",

    "description": "A doctor said powerlifting helped her boost her mood and energy while building muscle. She said two exercises can save you time in the gym.",
    "fullText": "When Dr. Shernan Holtan started lifting weights in 2013, she was mainly looking for a bit of me-time.\n\nHer career in bone marrow transplants — plus raising two kids — had left her with little room to take care of herself.\n\nAfter hiring a personal trainer, and was shocked at how much her energy and mood improved.\n\n\"All the energy you put in, you get back manyfold more through the metabolic and mental benefits of exercise,\" Holtan told Business Insider.\n\n\"As soon as I really realized what this was doing for me physically and mentally, I wanted to implement this for patients too.\"\n\nHer patients at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, New York receive stem cell treatments for conditions like leukemia — a grueling procedure that can require months of recovery time in a hospital.\n\nOnce they started following Holtan's personalized exercise plans, they recovered and returned home weeks earlier than expected, according to Roswell Park data.\n\nAs for Holtan, chief of blood and marrow transplant at the center, she is now a record-setting powerlifter, building her way up to an all-time best squat of 308.6 pounds, earning her the top national rank for her age group in 2019.\n\nNow at 49 years old, she can easily squat 225 pounds for reps, deadlift 250, bench 125, and run for miles without getting tired.\n\nShe said her favorite muscle-building exercises pay dividends for long-term health and offer an immediate boost to energy, confidence, and mood.\n\n\"I'm super happy to say at age almost 50, I can do all those things, and that means that I fear very little during any given week,\" she said. \"I know I can tackle these hard things and recover from them. So whatever challenge you have, send it my way.\"\n\nOn a typical day, Holtan hits the gym at about 5:30 a.m. to pump iron before work. Her routine varies, including a mix of strength training, CrossFit, and running for well-balanced fitness.\n\nWhen it comes to muscle and strength gains, \"squats and deadlifts are king,\" Holtan said.\n\nBoth movements are compound exercises, tapping into multiple muscle groups at once, including the core, back, and legs, to secure and stabilize your body and the weight as you move.\n\nTo get the most out of weightlifting and avoid injury, Holtan recommends starting small, with a weight you can handle and a number of reps that doesn't leave you exhausted. Then, build up a little at a time. That can make it easier to stick to a routine, rather than pushing too hard and feeling sore for a week (or more).\n\nFor patients recovering from treatment, Holtan gets them to begin with scaled exercises — doing squats without any added weights, or sitting back into a chair and standing up again until they have strength to do it without supportive equipment.\n\n\"Let's start with where you're at today. That's how you build without hurting yourself,\" she said. \"Major gains can be made over time with consistency.\"\n\nStrength training isn't just about building muscle; it can also help stave off early death, according to a growing body of research.\n\nHowever, it's only part of the equation — exercise that gets your heart pumping is crucial to prevent heart disease and lower the risk of heart attack and stroke, studies show.\n\nThat's why Holtan added running, hiking, and other cardio, like jump roping, to her routine.\n\nAs a result, she's lifting a bit less weight than when she trained for powerlifting alone, but can now easily run for five, six, or even seven miles (a feat she previously thought was unimaginable for her).\n\nChanging it up with new types of training also keeps exercise fun, and boosts her mood and energy, Holtan said, and the better longevity is a bonus.\n\n\"The main motivator, honestly, is I feel better today,\" Holtan said.\"Perhaps my rate of aging is slowing. Perhaps my risk of cancer is decreasing, perhaps my risk of other chronic diseases, including dementia, maybe that's decreasing too, and that's a nice benefit.\"",

    "fullText": "Locals band together in David v Goliath battle against facility they say would jack up bills, increase pollution and destroy area’s character\n\nA who’s who of the nation’s most powerful politicians and tech tycoons are forcing through a proposal for a massive data center in rural Michigan as locals from across the political spectrum have come out in force against it, with one calling it “uniquely evil”.\n\nSaline Township, Michigan, residents fear the $7bn center would jack up energy bills, pollute groundwater, and destroy the area’s rural character. The 1.4 gigawatt center would consume as much power as Detroit, and would help derail Michigan’s nation-leading transition to renewable energy.\n\nResponding to resident pressure, Saline Township’s board of trustees in September voted down the plans, but the data center’s powerful backers – including Donald Trump, Open AI’s Sam Altman, Oracle’s Larry Ellison, Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, utility giant DTE Energy, and Stephen Ross, the real-estate billionaire and Trump donor who owns Related Co – fought back.\n\nRelated Digital sued, and, vastly outgunned, the township board quickly folded and reversed its decision over strong resident objections. Now the project’s backers are trying to avoid minimal regulatory scrutiny on energy costs and pollution.\n\nThe controversy over the data center is representative of the David v Goliath fights playing out across the US, pitting working- and middle-class residents against the interests of billionaires and the political establishment.\n\n“This is part of an experience that America and the world is having around tech billionaires who are seizing power and widening the gap between those have much too much … and the working and middle classes,” said Yousef Rabhi, a former Democratic state legislative leader and clean energy advocate who opposes the plans.\n\n“That’s what these data centers are symbolic of, and they’re the vehicle for is the furtherance of this divide,” Rabhi added.\n\nThe proposal is part of the broader “Stargate” project composed of five data centers backed by the Trump administration, which granted $500bn in federal subsidies for them. It’s the largest project in Michigan history in terms of investment, and it also received subsidies on taxes that could have gone to roads and schools, among other uses, Rabhi said.\n\nThe plan’s supporters say the center would provide essential AI infrastructure, in part for national security, and create a few hundred jobs. Huge sums of money are at stake for the tech and utility companies.\n\nRoss’s Related Digital is the data center’s developer, while OpenAI, which produced ChatGPT, and Oracle will use the center to house its AI infrastructure.\n\nIn a statement, Related Digital alleged company the township’s decision violated zoning laws, and the spokesperson stressed the suit was filed jointly with three Saline Township property owners who are selling their property to Related.\n\n“Thankfully, we were able to reach a settlement agreement with the township to allow this project to move forward,” the spokesperson said. They noted Related is also making about $14m in donations to local causes.\n\nSaline Township is a small community of about 4,000 just outside Ann Arbor. The Stargate project is one of around a dozen data center proposals in Michigan over the last year that are strongly opposed at the local level. It’s one of four proposed near Ann Arbor – last week, plans for a second a few miles away in a neighboring town surfaced.\n\nSome municipalities have been successful in derailing plans, while others have lost the fight.\n\nIn Saline Township, former US marine Kate Haushalter and her husband are raising five children in a farmhouse next to the data center site. They bought and renovated the once-dilapidated home so they could live in a bucolic area, and Haushalter said she was not about to cede ground even though the township did.\n\n“Maybe because I was in the Marine Corps, but I would rather stay and fight,” Haushalter said. “I’m sure the chances are slim, but it’s worth fighting for, and I don’t want to teach my kids to roll over.”\n\nBig tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Open AI, which often own data centers, typically have enough political support at the state and federal levels that inexperienced local leaders who are comparatively poorly resourced are left on their own to defend their town from the centers.\n\nSaline Township supervisor Jim Marion conveyed that challenge when he told angry residents during a contentious November discussion that the township’s “hands were tied”.\n\n“This township doesn’t have the money to fight these big companies. You got to understand that,” Marion told the crowd. “We were dealt the cards we were dealt.”\n\nSome municipalities have utilized zoning laws to block the centers. Beyond that, there’s little local officials can do, and state and federal level regulations on the centers are virtually non-existent.\n\nStill, residents are growing more organized. A first protest on 1 December drew about 200 people, who Rabhi described as “truly a cross-section of American society”. The next week, 800 people participated in a state-level public input session, and organizers are pressuring state environmental regulators to hold up the project’s required wetland permits.\n\nAmong residents leading the pushback is Josh LeBaron, whose home sits about 500 yards from the site, where crews have broken down.\n\nHe characterized the project as “uniquely evil” because of the environmental risks, and because, he and others allege, the companies and government have been secretive about their plans. In response to questions about accusations of nimby-ism leveled against local residents by the project’s supporters, LeBaron said he would not be opposed to other developments.\n\nHe noted that Michigan is full of former industrial sites that would be more appropriate for the 575-acre property.\n\n“I would be at home reading a book if it were a subdivision,” LeBaron said.\n\nA Related spokesperson told the Guardian the company “explored sites across Michigan before deciding on this site, which is ideal as it’s a contiguous flat area”, and is set close to a major road and transmission lines.\n\nLocal opponents’ best hope for holding up the project lies in the arcane utility regulatory process on the massive amount of power the data center would require.\n\nDTE Energy claims the data center’s power demands and need for expensive new infrastructure will not increase residential electricity prices.\n\nBut it doesn’t want to show its math.\n\nDTE filed a petition with the Michigan Public Services Commission (MPSC), the state agency that regulates utilities, asking the MPSC to fast-track the plan’s approval. DTE’s request for an “ex parte” case requires limited scrutiny of its claim that the center won’t destroy the climate laws, or increase electricity bills.\n\nIn response, Michigan attorney general Dana Nessel and consumer advocacy groups filed a legal petition with the MPSC, calling for a “contested case” that would require much closer regulatory review of DTE’s claims.\n\nThe MPSC is helmed by Whitmer appointees, and the governor has strongly backed the project, raising suspicions among opponents that the agency will approve the ex parte request.\n\nStudies from across the country have shown data centers often increase rates, and DTE and regulators “cannot claim transparency while shutting the public out of the only process that requires DTE to support its claims with actual evidence”, said Bryan Smigielski, Michigan campaign organizer for the Sierra Club, which is intervening in the regulatory battle.\n\nIn a statement, a DTE spokesperson said: “To be clear, these data center customer contracts will NOT create a cost increase for our existing customers.”\n\nDTE has said the project won’t derail Michigan’s transition to clean energy, but state data and DTE’s plans suggest otherwise.\n\nMichigan, in late 2023, passed nation-leading climate laws that require utilities to transition to renewable energy by 2040. But the law included an “off-ramp” that allows utilities to continue running or building fossil fuel plants if renewable sources cannot handle the energy grid’s load.\n\nAt its peak, DTE’s grid already demands about 9.5 gigawatts of power, while the grid’s capacity is 11gw.\n\nIn July, DTE told investors it is in negotiations with big tech companies to provide 7gw of power for several proposed data centers.\n\nThe Saline center’s 1.4gw may not cause an exceedance of the 11gw threshold, especially because DTE is planning to build battery storage. But the Saline center along with any of the other proposed centers likely would trigger the off-ramp.\n\nDTE appears to be planning for that likelihood: DTE Energy executives said the company would likely need to build new gas plants to accommodate the data centers’ demand.\n\nHaushalter’s kids were born in the renovated farmhouse and are homeschooled there.\n\nShe and her husband try to teach the kids to respect nature. The family manages beehives, watches the geese and plant trees for wood to use in their wood-burning stove. At night, they take the kids outdoors for bonfires to look at the stars. “We’re not a big screen family,” Haushlater said.\n\nThe noise, light and air pollution is already disrupting the life the family built over 13 years. The center, if it is fully built, would fully destroy it, Haushalter said.\n\n“We are really passionate about nature and teaching our kids about it and I can’t believe the biggest construction project in Michigan is landing literally in my backyard, and there’s no recourse for the little guy,” she said. “It’s going to crush us.”",

    "fullText": "This reporting is published in collaboration with AlgorithmWatch and is supported by the European Digital Rights (EDRi), European Center for Non-For-Profit Law (ECNL), and Lighthouse Reports investigative journalism & civil society collaboration grants.\n\nIreland is now home to one of the highest concentrations of data centers in the world. What began as a quiet build-out of server farms around Dublin has expanded into an industrial presence with an ecological footprint that dominates the country’s electricity system. In the meanwhile, Big Tech has falsely portrayed itself as a partner in green transition.\n\nThe surge in energy consumption has reshaped the energy system around the needs of a handful of multinational tech companies. Grid capacity is being diverted to new hyperscale sites, transmission upgrades are being driven by their load, and the state is pouring billions into emergency fossil-fuel generators to keep supply stable. Households face higher bills, electrification plans have stalled, and national climate targets are slipping out of reach. What looks like a renewable success story on paper masks a system increasingly strained by a single, rapidly expanding sector of energy users.\n\nA growing social resistance has emerged in response. In nearby towns to Dublin, such as Rochfortbridge and Naas, local communities are pushing back against plans for new developments. At a national level, movements like “Energy for Who?” are demanding that renewables and grid connections be prioritized for essential social infrastructure, including housing and transport. Recent polling suggests this perspective is broadly shared by the public. Yet, government planning has so far focused on stabilizing digital growth, rather than reimagining how it fits within the goals of a just and affordable energy transition.\n\nIreland has thus become a test case for the political, economic, and environmental contradictions created by unregulated hyperscale expansion. As the EU moves to triple its data center capacity under the AI Continent Action Plan, the pressures already destabilizing Ireland’s grid offer a preview of what the continent may soon face.\n\nUnlike the hyperscale sites now being built across the globe amidst the frenzy of AI speculation, Ireland’s data center load growth was initially driven by more traditional uses: cloud storage, banking infrastructure, and the vast personal data archives that underpinned Big Tech’s earlier phase of expansion.\n\nSince the start of the post-war era, the Irish government has run an economic strategy based around courting investment from foreign multinationals – using a range of tools including tax incentives and infrastructure investment. This approach found real success with the rise of the ICT industry in the 1980s and 1990s, as US multinationals flooded into the country to lower their tax obligations and set up shop for export physical electronics, software, and services to the wider EU.\n\nAs money was channeled into a small set of tech giants in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, and the demand for computational capacity rose, Dublin began to see a steady growth in data centers – linking Big Tech’s offshore headquarters to the United States via a network of undersea internet cables.\n\nThe tech sector grew rapidly: Today, it has become a major source of government revenue and the main applicant for new electricity demand. Energy consumption by data centers is by far the highest in Europe: in comparison to the total Irish national consumption, they accounted for a 22% share in 2024. Roughly 97% of these data centers are clustered in the wider Dublin area. In 2023, 88% of all corporation tax was paid by foreign multinationals, of which 57% was paid by just 10 companies. A report from the Irish Central Bank suggests a major driver of growing tax revenue between 2011 and 2021 was “a small number of extremely profitable ICT firms.\"\n\nFor academic Patrick Brodie, this dependence is the latest chapter in a much longer development model. Ireland, he argues, “hitched its wagon to the transatlantic investment relationship” in the post-war period, shaping the country’s industrial and infrastructural landscape ever since. That bargain was never just about taxes. “It was also about building infrastructure,” he says, “and about managing the environmental contradictions that came with it.”\n\nThose contradictions are now concentrated directly in the electricity system, according to Brodie. Vast public resources are mobilized to serve capital-intensive digital infrastructure, even as shortages persist in housing, transport, and public services. “You can’t have a green transition that’s genuinely independent if it’s dictated by the needs of monopolistic tech companies,” he adds.\n\nThis facilitative model has already reappeared in different shades across Europe – from the UK’s AI Growth Zones, to Sweden’s energy tax break for data centers, or Denmark’s build-out of low-latency fiber optic and grid overcapacity. But nowhere has the potential bargain between digital growth and energy planning been pushed further than in Ireland. The consequences are now becoming visible across the country’s grid, climate trajectory, and public finances.\n\nThe Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) put an effective moratorium on new data center grid connections in Dublin, requiring new connections to be in unconstrained parts of the grid with sufficient local generation capacity. However, the grid remained fragile.\n\nIn response, the government and the energy system operator moved to commission emergency gas generators near the port of Dublin, the Irish Midlands, and a handful of additional sites, at an estimated cost of €1 billion. To help ease congestion, a wave of investment has been going into upgrading the grid’s capacity to distribute electricity. Much of this cost has been shouldered by Irish households, adding an average of roughly €100 per family to the bills in 2024.\n\nYet most of this newly created grid capacity was not used to electrify homes, rail, heat pumps, or industry. It was hoarded by data center developers. Ireland had limited rules governing priority access to grid connections, so hyperscalers simply booked capacity years in advance, effectively shutting out other users. For instance, a grid connection originally planned to serve new housing in Castlebaggot, West Dublin, was instead allocated to data centers.\n\nThe CRU suggested this trend was threatening the country’s broader targets for decarbonization and housing development: “The potential level of data center demand could significantly impact [the grid’s] ability to accommodate demand connections required to support Government policy targets such as 550,000 new homes by 2040, 680,000 heat pumps and 945,000 EVs [Electric Vehicles] by 2030, major electrified rail projects explicitly identified in the National Development Plan and other social infrastructure.”\n\nIreland is one of the most fossil fuel-reliant economies in Europe. “About 80% of all the energy we use today for our homes, our heating, our appliances, and our industry comes from fossil fuels,” says Paul Deane, senior lecturer in Clean Energy Futures at University College Cork.\n\nNevertheless, tech firms continued to portray themselves as green-transition partners — largely through Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (CPPAs). These allow companies to claim renewable electricity procurement on paper even when their facilities draw from the grid’s fossil-fuel-heavy mix in practice. Europe-wide, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are the three largest buyers.\n\nData from RE-Source suggests most CPPAs signed in Ireland are either financial – that is, not based on physical power delivery to the buyer – or structured in a way that has not been publicly disclosed. Only 14% are confirmed to involve a direct physical connection between the generator and the off-taker. The sources consulted for this investigation suggest the majority of these CPPAs match electricity on an annual basis rather than hour by hour.\n\nThe result is a widening gulf between corporate sustainability claims and actual, system-wide decarbonization.\n\nThese contradictions can be seen clearly in the Midlands where Bord na Móna’s planned Eco Energy Park will co-locate future Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centers with renewable-energy infrastructure. AWS is aiming to contract up to 800 MW of new wind and solar generation from Bord na Móna’s wider project pipeline — a volume of electricity roughly equivalent to the annual consumption of 2.2 million Irish homes. But so far, just 105 MW has been secured through a CPPA linking a proposed new AWS site to a nearby wind farm. Whenever the wind drops, any data centers built at the site will still draw power from the national grid, including fossil-fuel generated electricity.\n\nTo guarantee stability, Bord na Móna has already applied for a 600 MW gas plant adjacent to the site, which it claims will later switch to hydrogen or biomethane, according to the company’s environmental impact assessment report. No credible pathway exists to supply these fuels at this scale.\n\n“Renewable energy only helps meet our legally binding carbon budgets if it replaces fossil fuel demand, ” says Hannah Daly, Professor of Sustainable Energy at University College Cork. “If there was evidence that data centers were financing projects that wouldn’t otherwise have been built and that would match their demand at all hours of the year without creating bottlenecks for other renewables, they would at least not harm our carbon budgets.\"\n\nAnalysis conducted by AlgorithmWatch and Tech Policy Press, drawing on tech majors’ sustainability reports and press releases, suggests the total announced new capacity brought online via CPPAs with data centers in Ireland is far behind the pressure that data center expansion has already put on the energy system. Even if all announced CPPAs come online, they will still fall behind the load that has already been imposed on the system.\n\nIn a paper commissioned by FOE Ireland, Professor Daly found that half of the new capacity came from CPPAs, as opposed to government-run auctions, between 2020 and 2023. But this volume only amounted to 16% of the new data center demand during this period. Daly’s findings mirror our own. Despite industry claims of 100% renewable procurement, Ireland’s data centers in aggregate have seemingly deepened the country’s dependence on fossil fuels.\n\nYet regulators have limited power to intervene. Out of fear for the country’s energy security, the Irish government has promised to spend more on its fossil fuel infrastructure, beginning construction of a state-led strategic gas emergency reserve. The reserve will take the form of a floating LNG (liquefied natural gas) tanker and regasification plant, with an estimated upfront cost of between €300 and €900 million.\n\nMeanwhile, developers are increasingly turning to on-site gas generation to circumvent grid constraints entirely. Microsoft’s Grange Castle campus in Dublin has a fleet of gas generators totaling 239 MW. The site is one of seven with existing gas connections, five of which are currently actively consuming gas. Analysis by Hannah Daly from Cork’s University College suggests an additional four sites are awaiting connection and 22 have submitted planning requests.\n\nDaly shows that if existing, pending, and proposed gas-connected data center sites all operate at full capacity, they would emit up to 16.6 MtCO₂ per year — equivalent to 68% of Ireland’s total national emissions in 2023. She notes that Gas Network Ireland’s own, more conservative estimates, still predict an overshoot on sectoral emissions targets by 21-30%, driven by existing and confirmed on-site gas connections respectively.\n\nGas Networks Ireland and several private actors see this gas demand as a temporary, transitional problem as the network switches over to low-carbon hydrogen and bio-methane. Daly’s colleague Paul Deane remains sceptical. “Some data-center owners say they’ll only use gas for a few years, but there’s no convincing evidence of an off-ramp,” he says. “The promise of a technology in the future, isn't good enough to allow you to burn more natural gas today.”\n\nThese various interlinked problems have come to the fore in the discussions of the new Large Energy Users (LEU) Connection Policy. Expected to be finalized before the end of the year by the CRU, the policy will set out new rules for how data centers connect to the grid. The policy’s main goals are to improve grid stability, ensure sufficient on-site or nearby generation capacity, and strengthen emissions reporting.\n\nHowever, in the draft text, the CRU concedes that it will not receive enforcement powers to mandate renewable procurement, emissions caps, or set requirements for the decarbonization of the gas network.\n\nThe specialists interviewed said this reflects a broader pattern: rather than confronting the political trade-offs between digital growth and sustainability, the Irish government has deferred control to regulators tasked with managing that growth as smoothly as possible. The LEU policy, critics say, is the latest example of this deference to regulatory authority.\n\n“Ireland’s climate legislation directly conflicts with several of our enterprise strategies. There’s a lack of acceptance that it’s impossible to reconcile the constraints of carbon emission targets with what’s necessary for the growth of this industry via technological measures alone,” Daly says. “The right technologies and supply measures would need to be put in place ahead of the growth of the industry, not afterwards.”\n\nRosi Leonard, a data‑center campaigner for Friends of the Earth Ireland, argues that the government overestimates the sector’s mobility: companies are unlikely to abandon existing infrastructure in Ireland, even under stricter regulations, and any departure would indicate the need for broader economic diversification.\n\nThe Irish case has seen a consistent pattern: tech-sector growth is treated as inevitable, while climate obligations are accommodated around it. Managing the strained infrastructure comes at the cost of rising emissions and deferred decarbonization - a lesson that other countries facing rapid digital expansion will soon have to confront.\n\nIreland’s experience is no longer a local anomaly. The EU’s AI Continent Action Plan proposes tripling data center capacity by 2030 to support continent-wide AI deployment, cloud services, and high-performance computing. But the plan does not resolve the fundamental challenges that Ireland is now experiencing: scarce grid capacity, fossil fuel lock-in, insufficient transmission infrastructure, and potential social pressures caused by rising energy prices.\n\nThe EU also risks repeating one of Ireland’s biggest mistakes on renewable energy. Its plan to use public funds to de-risk long-term contracts for hyperscale data centers — through agreements linking governments, utilities and tech firms — could end up funneling taxpayers’ money into deals that let companies claim that they use renewable electricity without actually cutting emissions.\n\nEurope still has time to avoid these pitfalls. Countries planning to host hyperscale clusters should ensure sufficient energy capacity before data centers are built; block direct fossil-gas connections; enforce 24/7 renewable matching; and plan for the availability of clean power for critical public services and housing, rather than ring-fencing new renewables for the tech sector through CPPAs.\n\nThe Irish case shows what happens when digital expansion outruns energy planning, and when political dependency on a small group of firms overrides climate commitments. The costs - higher prices, deeper fossil lock-in, strained infrastructure, and derailed emissions targets - are now visible across the country, while access for homes, transport and essential infrastructure remains a low priority. The EU can treat Ireland as a cautionary tale, or repeat its mistakes on a continental scale.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge on Wednesday blocked Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 's attempt to shut down an aging oil pipeline running beneath a channel linking two of the Great Lakes, finding that only the federal government can regulate interstate pipeline safety.\n\nWhitmer, a Democrat, ordered regulators in 2020 to revoke an easement that allows Enbridge Inc. to operate a 4.5-mile (6.4) kilometer pipeline segment under the Straits of Mackinac, which link Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Whitmer made the move out of concern that the 72-year-old pipeline could rupture and cause a catastrophic spill.\n\nEnbridge filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block the revocation and the pipeline continues to operate. President Donald Trump's administration argued in filings this year that Whitmer's order interferes with U.S. foreign energy policy and that only the federal government, not the states, can regulate pipeline safety. The pipeline segment, known as Line 5, moves crude oil between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario.\n\nU.S. District Judge Robert Jonker wrote in an opinion that revoking the easement would effectively shut down Line 5. He found that Congress expressly prohibited states from regulating interstate pipeline safety in the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992. He also noted that the United States and Canada agree that Michigan's attempt to shut down the pipeline interferes with their federal foreign policy positions and trade relations.\n\n“An oil spill in Michigan's Great Lakes would undoubtedly be an environmental catastrophe. And Michigan would undoubtedly be the recipient of almost all the environmental damage that would result,” Jonker wrote. “But for better or worse, the national government has unequivocally decided to displace state power in this area and assume exclusive responsibility for interstate pipeline safety.”\n\nA message seeking comment was left for a spokesperson for Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, whose office represented Whitmer's administration in the lawsuit. A Whitmer spokesperson referred questions to Nessel.\n\nEnbridge issued a statement saying the line is safe and that Jonker's ruling protects both the United States and Canada from “significant energy disruptions.”\n\nMultiple other legal challenges are swirling around Line 5 in Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nNessel filed her own action in 2019 seeking to void the easement in the straits. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently weighing whether that case belongs in state or federal court. And a number of environmental groups and tribes have sued challenging state permits authorizing Enbridge's plan to build a protective tunnel around the straits segment. That case is pending before the Michigan state Supreme Court.\n\nIn Wisconsin, a federal judge ruled in 2023 that Enbridge must remove a section of Line 5 that runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa's reservation. The company has proposed a 41-mile (66-kilometer) route around the reservation, but the tribe and environmentalists say construction could harm the environment and the new route would still leave the region vulnerable to a spill.\n\nThe Bad River has sued in state court seeking to void state permits for the project; that case is still pending. The tribe along with a number of environmental groups also is challenging the permits through the state's contested case process, a proceeding similar to a lawsuit that will culminate with an administrative law judge's ruling.\n\nThe tribe filed a federal lawsuit on Tuesday in Washington, D.C., challenging U.S. Army Corps of Engineer permits authorizing the reroute.",

    "description": "The footage was grainy but unmistakable: US marines fast-roping from a black hawk helicopter onto the deck of an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela.",
    "fullText": "The footage was grainy but unmistakable: US marines fast-roping from a black hawk helicopter onto the deck of an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela.\n\nSeizing the vessel, one of Caracas’ sanctioned “ghost ships” illegally shipping crude oil, was the prelude to the second act of Donald Trump’s campaign to topple Nicolas Maduro.\n\nWithin days, the US president announced a full naval blockade designed to sever the Venezuelan president’s economic lifeline and compel his loyal inner circle to oust him.\n\n“Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the history of South America. It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before,” Mr Trump declared on Tuesday.\n\nInsiders see the move as a creative new calculus aimed at starving Mr Maduro’s government, whose survival depends on selling crude oil abroad, while simultaneously forcing his allies in Moscow and Beijing to abandon him.\n\n“The White House is committed to the effort against the regime and seeing Maduro ousted,” a source close to the administration said.\n\nThis is the plan behind Mr Trump’s unprecedented blockade and the campaign the White House hopes rids Venezuela of its global influence.\n\nPerched in his presidential office in Miraflores Palace, Mr Maduro has relied on the export of Venezuela’s vast oil reserves to prop up his country.\n\nBeneath him lies more crude oil than Saudi Arabia, Russia or the United States and the mineral, dubbed “liquid gold”, accounts for about 88 per cent of Venezuela’s $24bn in exports.\n\nSince 2019, Mr Trump has sought to stop that.\n\nIn his first term, the US Treasury sanctioned Venezuela’s state oil company, PDVSA, and threatened secondary sanctions on any entity doing business with it.\n\nTo get around this, Mr Maduro’s government has turned to a clandestine “dark fleet” of tankers to evade sanctions and keep oil flowing to buyers in China, Russia and Cuba.\n\nHundreds of ageing tankers now smuggle sanctioned oil, acting as a financial lifeline to Caracas. As of late November, more than 30 of the 80 ships in Venezuelan waters or approaching the country were under US sanctions.\n\nIt is a growing phenomenon. Financial intelligence firm S&P Global estimates that one in five oil tankers worldwide are used to smuggle oil from sanctioned countries.\n\nThe tactic appears to be working. Despite international pressure, oil exports rose to some 921,000 barrels per day in November, the third-highest monthly average so far this year.\n\n“What they’re doing is essentially trying to cut off any remaining source of revenue for the government, to try to rattle the government into changing the regime,” said Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House.\n\nIndeed, oil tanker seizures are viewed by experts as the final act in Mr Trump’s chapter of maximum pressure that began with sanctions years before.\n\n“The revenue that is coming in from oil is something that the regime has long since used as a tool to buy influence within the military and maintain what little the government still is able to produce in the form of oil,” Andrés Martínez-Fernández, senior policy analyst for Latin America at the Allison Centre for National Security, explained.\n\n“It’s very quickly going to create instability to a new level within Venezuela and the regime.”\n\nRelations between Washington and Caracas are at a nadir. The US and many of its allies consider Mr Maduro, who is currently serving his disputed third term, as a dictator.\n\nYet thanks to the export of Venezuela’s oil, Mr Maduro has formed a network of loyal military commanders and international allies who keep his reign afloat.\n\nNone have become more important than China, which is the biggest buyer of Venezuelan oil, taking roughly 80 per cent of its exports. Every day it imports around 746,000 barrels of oil.\n\nBeijing has taken the oil not as a commercial import but as debt repayment towards an estimated $60bn in loans it has poured into Venezuelan oil projects.\n\nThe repayment deal suited both sides. Beijing secured oil while Maduro gained time and a friend on the international stage.\n\nThe blockade now threatens to derail the relationship and turn China against Mr Maduro as the ghost fleet of tankers stop arriving in Beijing’s ports.\n\nIf Venezuelan oil can no longer be delivered reliably, then Mr Maduro ceases to be an asset to China and becomes a legal liability as it chases repayment.\n\n“Once shipments stop arriving at foreign ports, the debts start getting called in. And that’s going to have an immediate impact. Things are going to start breaking down quickly, physical infrastructure, if these payments don’t start to come in,” Mr Martínez-Fernández explained.\n\n“It could get to a point where China says, ‘we would be better off being rid of this headache and being rid of Maduro, then by continuing any kind of active support.”\n\nBeijing has shown little sympathy to similar situations in the past. In Africa and Central Asia, the state has repeatedly distanced itself from leaders it no longer sees as reliable partners.\n\nFor Mr Trump, the blockade is another step in his plan dubbed the “Donroe Doctrine” by insiders, which aims to rid America’s backyard of Chinese influence.\n\nProject 2025, the Heritage Foundation doctrine long believed to be a blueprint for his second term, calls it “re-hemisphering”. It calls for the capture of supply chains in the region as a requirement of US economic security.\n\nIn that sense, the blockade is not aimed at confronting China head on but at making Mr Maduro persona non grata. If the oil-for-debt deal collapses, Beijing may consider switching horses and abandoning him.\n\nAlso in the crosshairs is Havana, which has long relied on subsidised Venezuelan oil.\n\nCuba, which has been the subject of its own US blockade, has been receiving some 24,000 barrels of crude, gasoline and jet fuel per day from the regime.\n\nMr Sabatini said the blockade will be “catastrophic” for Cuba, a historic enemy of the US, and estimates that exports will drop dramatically.\n\n“This is the moment that people like Marco Rubio [the secretary of state] and Cuban-American hardliners living in Florida have been waiting for,” he said.\n\n“They’re trying to starve the government. By doing that, then they actually starve the people too.”\n\nWhile China has poured millions into Venezuelan oil projects, Russia has been a key enabler in the shadows.\n\nA Russian-linked “dark fleet” of tankers have also helped Mr Maduro avoid sanctions by shipping his oil around the globe. However, Putin, who has sought to curry favour with Mr Trump since his return to the Oval Office, may redirect the vessels, further isolating Mr Maduro.\n\nIndeed, signs of Moscow’s shift in position are already there. Reports from late November suggested that Russia had initiated the evacuation of its citizens from the region.\n\nExperts agree that Mr Trump is attempting to squeeze Mr Maduro economically while testing the resolve of his few remaining allies in the hope they turn against him.\n\n“It does seem to be another way for the administration to ratchet up the pressure against the Maduro government,” said Brian Finucane, a former state department lawyer who is now senior adviser at the International Crisis Group.\n\nThe formation of the armada, the largest US military presence in the region in decades, began with a series of strikes on boats the Trump administration claimed were ferrying illegal narcotics to the US.\n\nFor months, American forces have launched lethal strikes on small vessels skimming through international waters under the banner of anti-drug operations.\n\nUS navy and coastguard units have destroyed around 20 boats since early September, killing over 90 people.\n\nEight warships, including three destroyers, three amphibious assault ships, a cruiser and a smaller littoral combat ship now make up the largest US military presence in the region in decades.\n\nThey are joined by a squadron of F-35B Lightning II jets and a handful of Reaper drones, which are capable of flying long distances and carrying up to eight laser-guided missiles. B-2 bombers have also been spotted flying off the coast.\n\nIt has led many Venezuelans, and many Americans, to believe that Mr Trump is preparing for war.\n\nThe blockade, insiders suggest, is one of the lesser military escalations the president had been weighing with his cabinet in recent weeks.\n\nInstead, they hope to turn the very cartels that military officials say are complicit in the smuggling of fentanyl to the US, against their leader by choking their cash flow, which is used to finance them.\n\nFor the armed forces, oil revenue is the glue that keeps the system intact. Generals control ports, customs and fuel distribution, making the military a pillar of Mr Maduro’s power.\n\nAs long as Mr Maduro can afford to pay his generals, their unfettered loyalty and in turn, his regime, will continue.\n\nThe same logic applies to Mr Maduro’s alleged relationship with organised crime. These groups rely on access to ports and laundering routes, all of which are sustained by the cash generated by oil sales.\n\n“It doesn’t take us yet to the place where we’re going into Venezuelan territory and conducting military strikes. We’re still talking about operations in international waters,” Mr Martínez-Fernández said.\n\nThe formation of the armada, coupled with Mr Trump’s continued threat of land strikes, have led experts to believe that the blockade is part of a slide towards conflict.\n\nTop military officials are said to have presented the US president with options for military intervention in the region which include land strikes. Other options reported to have been drawn up by the Pentagon include direct attacks on Mr Maduro’s security detail or operations to seize the country’s oil fields.\n\nIn each, Mr Trump is said to be against ideas that may place American troops at risk or could turn into an embarrassing failure.\n\nMr Trump and his cabinet have begun framing the blockade as a necessary intervention to reclaim “American oil”.\n\nSo what is stopping him? Perhaps his thirst for the Nobel Peace Prize and the potential blowback amongst his America First base if he started a war.\n\nWhat happens next will be determined by Mr Trump’s blockade. If oil flow continues, Mr Maduro survives.\n\nBut if it is stopped, China may decide the debt is not worth collecting and his cash-poor lieutenants may turn against him.\n\nThe gamble in Washington is simple; regimes do not fall when they are attacked but when they are abandoned.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "When Steve Evans got the call from the Bristol Rovers' hierarchy to be their new head coach, he had one condition - he needed a hotel to stay in with a swimming pool.\n\nFar from demanding the height of luxury because he could, a pool means that Evans can keep up his routine of swimming 70 to 80 lengths every day.\n\nIn the eight-and-a-half months since the 63-year-old was last in the dugout at Rotherham United to being appointed at League Two strugglers Bristol Rovers, Evans has lost eight-and-a-half stone in weight.\n\nWorking with a \"specialist team\", he has transformed his fitness, now swimming and spending time on a bike daily alongside dieting.\n\n\"One of my insistences in the short term when I came to Bristol was they had found me a hotel to stay in until I find an apartment, I insisted a hotel with a swimming pool,\" Evans told BBC Radio Bristol.\n\n\"They thought that was quite posh but it's not posh, it just allows me to do my work in the morning at six before I come in.\"",

    "description": "China buys Russian oil and gas at steep discounts while supplying Moscow with machinery and electronics as Western sanctions tighten.",
    "fullText": "Moscow's wartime pivot to Beijing has helped keep Russia's economy afloat under the weight of sweeping Western sanctions — but at a cost.\n\nWhat looks like a lifeline today may lock Moscow into a long-term role as Beijing's junior economic partner. Russia is now heavily dependent on China for key manufactured goods and advanced inputs blocked by Western sanctions, according to a report from the Atlantic Council, a think tank, published on Friday.\n\n\"Economically and politically, Russia's relationship with China is simultaneously deeply asymmetrical and mutually beneficial,\" wrote Elina Ribakova, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and Lucas Risinger, an economic analyst and nonresident research fellow at the Kyiv School of Economics Institute.\n\nChina buys up Russian oil at volumes that offset lost European customers — at a discount — while Russia buys machinery, vehicles, and electronics from the East Asian giant amid Western boycotts and sanctions.\n\n\"This is a complete and embarrassing reversal in the relationship compared to the 2000s, when Russia exported higher value-added goods to China,\" wrote the analysts.\n\nSince Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Kremlin has steered the country's economy into a wartime footing. Heavy defense and government spending help sustain topline resilience, despite sanctions and export restrictions.\n\nBut cracks are emerging as energy export revenues have fallen sharply in a low oil-price environment. Consumer demand has also weakened amid still high inflation.\n\nChina now accounts for a large share of Russia's imports, and the vast majority of its trade with China is settled in the Chinese yuan.\n\nRussia became China's top crude oil supplier in 2023, but the country accounts for just one-fifth of China's imports of the commodity. Meanwhile, oil and gas revenues account for a substantial one-third of Russia's budget inflows.\n\nTo be sure, China needs global buyers for its massive manufacturing sector, and Russia has become one of them. Still, the gains are \"far more important to Russia than to China,\" since Beijing doesn't rely on Moscow the way Europe relied on Russian energy, wrote the analysts.\n\nFurthermore, \"from an economic point of view, China is not a better trading partner for Russia than the European Union was. It buys oil and gas at lower prices, it invests far less in Russia, and its products are often technologically inferior,\" they added.\n\nThis skewed relationship gives Beijing substantial leverage in negotiations and transactions. China purchases Russian oil at steep discounts, knowing Moscow's alternatives are limited.\n\n\"While Moscow has not become Beijing's vassal — at least not to the extent that it would attack NATO purely to distract the Alliance from a war for Taiwan — Russia is certainly the junior partner in the 'no limits' partnership,\" the analysts wrote.",
