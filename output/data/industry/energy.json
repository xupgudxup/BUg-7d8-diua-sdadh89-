    "fullText": "The 1970s gave us muscle cars, oil crises, and some truly wild automotive experiments. While everyone's chasing Camaros and Corvettes at auctions, there's a whole world of fascinating machines from that decade that fly under the radar.\n\nThese overlooked cars offer character, quirky engineering, and surprisingly solid performance without the six-figure price tags. Some were ahead of their time, others were wonderfully weird, and a few were just plain misunderstood.\n\nAlright, time to check out these gems from the '70s that deserve more love from collectors.\n\nThe Gremlin gets mocked for its chopped-off rear end, but this little oddball was actually pretty clever. AMC created it by literally cutting down a Hornet to compete in the subcompact market, and it worked.\n\nWith optional V8 power, the Gremlin could surprise unsuspecting muscle cars at stoplights, and its quirky styling has aged into legitimate charm. You could get one with a 304 cubic inch V8 that made around 150 horsepower, which was respectable for the era.\n\nWhile collectors chase AMX models, clean Gremlins remain affordable and are starting to earn respect as honest, unpretentious American compacts.\n\nThe wedge-shaped TR7 was supposed to be Triumph's answer to modern sports car design, and while it had production issues, the driving experience was genuinely fun. Its \"wedge\" design was polarizing, earning the tagline \"The Shape of Things to Come,\" though reliability concerns overshadowed its decent handling.\n\nThe four-cylinder engine produced about 92 horsepower in North American spec, which sounds modest but kept the car nimble and engaging. Later TR8 models got a V8, but even the standard TR7 offers an accessible entry into British sports car ownership.\n\nThese days, you can find them for a fraction of what you'd pay for an MGB or Spitfire.\n\nBefore the 240Z became a collector darling, Datsun was building sensible sedans that happened to be incredibly well-engineered. The 710 was a reliable, practical sedan that competed with Toyota Corollas but somehow never achieved the same nostalgic status.\n\nIts 2.0-liter engine made around 94–97 horsepower (SAE net), depending on emissions spec and could reliably cruise all day without complaint. The wagon versions are particularly appealing today, offering classic lines and surprising cargo space.\n\nWhile collectors obsess over Z-cars, the humble 710 represents Datsun's commitment to quality without demanding classic car prices.\n\nSold through Mercury dealers, the Capri II was a captive import from Ford of Europe rather than a traditional American pony car. Built in Germany, it brought European hatchback styling and a more refined driving feel to the U.S. market at a time when domestic performance cars were shrinking.\n\nPower came from sensible options like the 2.3-liter four-cylinder or an optional 2.8-liter V6, prioritizing balance and fuel economy over straight-line speed.\n\nWhile it never tried to compete directly with muscle cars, the Capri II offered tidy handling, distinctive fastback styling, and a level of character that set it apart from its American contemporaries. Overshadowed by Mustangs and later fox-body Capris, the Capri II remains an overlooked slice of 1970s transatlantic automotive history.\n\nThis mid-engine, targa-topped Italian was designed by Bertone and offered sports car thrills in an affordable package. With just about 75 horsepower from its 1.5-liter engine, the X1/9 wasn't about straight-line speed but rather handling and driver engagement.\n\nThe mid-engine layout gave it phenomenal balance, making it a blast on twisty roads. Its removable roof panel predated the Miata's popularity by decades and offered open-air driving without sacrificing structural rigidity.\n\nWhile Fiat's rust reputation scared some buyers away, well-maintained examples prove that proper Italian sports cars don't need big price tags.\n\nThe Volaré replaced the beloved Valiant and initially suffered quality issues, but the platform itself was quite capable. Once Chrysler sorted out the early problems, these became solid, dependable cars with comfortable rides.\n\nYou could option them with everything from slant-six engines to 360 cubic inch V8s making around 160–170 horsepower (SAE net), depending on year/trim. The Road Runner package added some muscle car DNA to a practical body, creating an interesting sleeper.\n\nEarlier Mopars often get all the love, but clean examples represent affordable entry into Chrysler performance heritage.\n\nBefore Subaru became synonymous with crossovers, they built a compact pickup truck with rear-facing jump seats in the bed. The BRAT (Bi-drive Recreational All-terrain Transporter) cleverly avoided the chicken tax by including those seats, classifying it as a passenger vehicle.\n\nIts four-wheel drive system was ahead of its time for a small truck, and the about 67 horsepower from its flat-four engine was adequate for the lightweight body. The quirky design and practical utility made it perfect for outdoor enthusiasts.\n\nToday, rust-free BRATs are increasingly hard to find, but they remain much more affordable than vintage Toyota trucks.\n\nThe Alfetta brought Italian performance engineering to the sedan market with its unique transaxle layout for perfect weight distribution. Named after Alfa's successful racing cars, it featured a rear-mounted transmission that helped achieve 50/50 balance.\n\nThe four-cylinder engine produced around 109-130 PS but delivered smooth power and that distinctive Alfa character. Its handling was exceptional for a sedan, rewarding drivers who appreciated precise steering and responsive chassis dynamics.\n\nWhile collectors chase Spiders and GTVs, the Alfetta sedan offers genuine Alfa driving pleasure without the premium prices.\n\nThe Vega had serious quality issues at launch, but the GT version with its sport suspension and styling upgrades was actually entertaining to drive. Its aluminum-block four-cylinder was innovative if flawed, producing around 85 horsepower (SAE net) in typical mid-’70s GT spec (varies by year/engine option).\n\nThe lightweight body and decent handling made it competitive in autocross and club racing. Many enthusiasts have discovered that dropping in a small-block V8 turns the Vega into a genuine pocket rocket.\n\nSure, the reputation keeps values low, but that means more opportunity for builders and drivers who want an affordable project.\n\nFrench engineering excellence doesn't get enough credit in American collector circles, and the 504 proves that point beautifully. This sedan won European Car of the Year and featured independent suspension, comfortable seating, and surprisingly robust construction.\n\nThe fuel-injected four-cylinder made around 96 horsepower but delivered smooth, refined power delivery. Its ride quality was exceptional, combining European handling with comfortable long-distance cruising.\n\nWhile Citroëns get the quirky attention, the 504 represents practical French design that actually worked reliably in American conditions.\n\nBefore the RX-7 became a rotary icon, Mazda built the smaller RX-3 with the same spinning triangle magic. U.S.-market RX-3s used the larger 12A rotary, with published outputs closer to about 90 horsepower in North American spec; the engine’s willingness to rev was a big part of the appeal.\n\nRacing versions dominated their classes in IMSA competition, proving the chassis was more than just economical transportation. The coupe and wagon versions offer distinctive styling that stands out from typical Japanese offerings.\n\nCollectors focus on RX-7s and leave these earlier rotaries as affordable alternatives with genuine motorsport heritage.\n\nVolvo built a reputation on safety and practicality, but the 242 GT showed they understood driving dynamics too. This special edition featured unique aerodynamic bodywork, sport suspension, and distinctive alloy wheels.\n\nThe fuel-injected four-cylinder produced around produced about 123 hp in fuel-injected B21E form (outputs varied by market and rating standard) and delivered surprisingly spirited performance. Its handling was sharp for a Volvo, rewarding drivers who pushed it through corners.\n\nWhile 240-series cars are common, finding a genuine GT with its special equipment is increasingly difficult, yet they remain affordable compared to BMW 2002s.\n\nThese twelve overlooked machines from the 1970s prove that collector appeal isn't always about what's most expensive or most famous. Each offers something special, whether it's innovative engineering, quirky charm, or genuine driving pleasure that got overshadowed by flashier contemporaries. The best part about exploring these forgotten gems is that you can actually afford to buy one, drive it, and enjoy it without worrying about depreciation or astronomical restoration costs. As the collector car market continues evolving, smart enthusiasts are discovering that sometimes the most rewarding classics are the ones everyone else walked past.",

    "fullText": "Region struggling with drought now threatened by energy-hungry facilities – but some residents are fighting back\n\nThe sign outside Tom Hermes’s farmyard in Perkins Township in Ohio, a short drive south of the shores of Lake Erie, proudly claims that his family have farmed the land here since 1900. Today, he raises 130 head of cattle and grows corn, wheat, grass and soybeans on 1,200 acres of land.\n\nFor his family, his animals and wider business, water is life.\n\nSo when, in May 2024, the Texas-based Aligned Data Centers broke ground on its NEO-01, four-building, 200,000 sq ft data center on a brownfield site that abuts farmland that Hermes rents, he was concerned.\n\n“We have city water here. That’s going to reduce the pressure if they are sucking all the water,” he says of the data center.\n\n“They’re not good, I know that.”\n\nTwo years ago, the company said it would invest about $202m on a “hyperscale” data center that would employ 18 people and dozens \n\nAll the while, a 10-minute drive north, the shoreline of Lake Erie hasn’t been this low in years.\n\nWater levels across all five Great Lakes have begun to drop in recent months as part of a long-term fall. Since 2019, the Great Lakes have seen water-level decreases of two to four feet. While experts say this is a natural decrease given the record highs the lakes have experienced since 2020, it’s happening at a time when a huge new consumer of water has appeared on the horizon: data centers.\n\nThe source of the largest single deposit of freshwater on the planet, the Great Lakes, in particular Lake Erie, are already struggling with the fallout of drought and warmer water temperatures that, at this time of year, fuel major lake-effect snowstorms, and greater than normal levels of evaporation due to the absence of ice cover.\n\nWith major cities such as Chicago, Toronto, Detroit and Pittsburgh all within a few hundred miles of each other, small, under-resourced communities around the Great Lakes have become hugely attractive for data-center companies.\n\nIn Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, Microsoft is building what it calls the “world’s most-powerful AI data center” that is set to open early next year and expected to use up to 8.4bn gallons of municipal water from the city of Racine every year. Racine gets its water from Lake Michigan. Similar stories are playing out in Hobart, Indiana, where AWS is planning to build a data center two miles from Lake Michigan’s shoreline, and in Port Washington, Wisconsin.\n\nIn Benton Harbor, Michigan, locals are concerned that a proposed $3bn data center would contribute to environmental pollution and traffic.\n\nForty miles west of Aligned’s under-construction data center in Ohio, in Woodville Township, hundreds of people showed up to a public meeting last October to voice concern about another proposed data center project in their rural community.\n\n“The Great Lakes region, especially in states such as Illinois and Ohio, [is] among the most data-center dense states in the region. In addition to the high volumes of water used on site for cooling, our recent research found that even more water may be consumed to generate electricity to power data centers’ energy needs,” says Kirsten James, senior program director for water at Ceres, a nonprofit headquartered in Boston.\n\n“These impacts can conflict with communities’ water-resource planning efforts.”\n\nThe Great Lakes Compact, a 2005 accord signed by the governors of eight US states and two Canadian provinces, means that Great Lakes Water must only be used within the regional basin.\n\nResearch by Purdue University found that data centers on average consume about 300,000 gallons of water a day. Water used by data centers is warmed significantly and for those that do not use a closed loop system, that heated effluent water, just 20% of the initial amount, is often discharged back into local wastewater systems or the environment, with potentially serious consequences for flora, fauna and human consumers. Even closed-loop systems that reuse the same water repeatedly need millions of gallons of water.\n\nWhile many new data centers are drawing water from local municipalities that, in turn, get their water from groundwater, much of that supply comes from the Great Lakes watersheds.\n\nSome communities are fighting back. Last month, residents of Fife Lake, Michigan, were overjoyed after hearing a plan for a data center in their town of 471 residents would be scrapped due to local opposition.\n\nSimilar stories of successful opposition have played out in Indiana and elsewhere.\n\nBut the data centers are fighting back.\n\nPrivate firms representing data center companies have often successfully sued community authorities, accusing them of illegally excluding certain types of developments, making small towns powerless in the battle to keep out giant water-guzzling corporations.\n\nIn Michigan’s Saline Township, a community of about 400 people outside Ann Arbor, OpenAI and Oracle used a representative company to successfully sue the local authority to overcome opposition and build a massive facility that would use 1.4 gigawatts of electricity – roughly the equivalent of powering 1.4 million homes.\n\nThe Detroit Free Press editorial board assailed the move, calling it a “a fait accompli, hammered into this tiny Washtenaw county community over the objections of residents, the elected board that represents them, and Michigan’s attorney general, absent expert or outside testimony save a cursory public hearing held over Microsoft Teams”.\n\nData companies and their backers, however, say their presence is a net gain for Great Lakes communities by providing jobs and investment over the course of years.\n\nAligned has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to Perkins Township, the local school system and a career center. In return, it gets a 15-year tax exemption from local authorities. A representative declined to respond to questions from the Guardian asking how much water it intends to use at the data center and from where it originates.\n\nLocal municipalities that support these facilities claim that the data centers will increase tax revenue and help rebuild ageing infrastructure such as water delivery systems that, in some places, are in significant need of upgrading. Calls, emails and messages left with Erie county commissioners asking if local authorities plan to supply the Perkins Township data center with water were not responded to.\n\nSome Perkins Township residents say a number of local companies have been hired during the construction phase, bringing work to the area.\n\nBut many argue those investments are not worth the long-term price the community may pay.\n\nAmanda Voegle, who works at a heating business now directly facing the data center, is concerned about water and many other issues.\n\n“A couple of years ago, there was a water pollution issue at the site. I’m very concerned. Is this [water] going back into the lake?”\n\nTwo years ago, the construction site upon which the data center is being built was found to be the source of contamination of a river that flows into Lake Erie, with the remediation company responsible cited by the Ohio EPA for unauthorized discharges into state waters.\n\n“I don’t understand why they built it so close to the street, because it’s an eyesore,” says Voegle.\n\nShe says there have been other unusual incidents at her workplace recently, including power surges.\n\n“I don’t know if it’s related [to the data center]. It’s probably almost weekly that we lose power and have to fully reboot everything. There was a couple of things we actually had to replace because [the power surge] fried it.”",

    "description": "Archer, Beta, and Joby are developing autonomous, gas-electric hybrid air taxis in hopes of clinching defense contracts.",
    "fullText": "US tech companies are hoping soon to gain clearance for flying taxis that make short commercial hops like Manhattan to LaGuardia Airport. Eyeing defense dollars, they're also equipping air taxies for the battlefield.\n\nAir taxis have wings and propellers, allowing them to take off and land like a helicopter and fly like an airplane. You can't yet hail a flying taxi anywhere in the US, though those futuristic flights could be coming in the next couple of years.\n\nPentagon leaders have shifted their focus to the tech industry, arguing that traditional defense contractors can't deliver new weapons fast or cheaply enough to meet today's fast-changing global threats. The Pentagon has pledged to pour billions of dollars into new technology and has issued requests for information on hybrid, autonomous air taxis, also known as vertical takeoff and landing vehicles, or VTOLs.\n\nFlying-taxi makers including Archer Aviation, Joby Aviation, and Beta Technologies say that gas-electric hybrid vehicles reminiscent of \"The Jetsons\" could carry military cargo more cheaply and quietly than helicopters. Some of the designs under development for the battlefield incorporate autonomous technology that could detect and avoid threats. The aircraft could be used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, or moving supplies and equipment, these companies say.\n\nAmerican air-taxi makers are racing to develop cutting-edge technology as Chinese companies like EHang do the same. The VTOL industry is still young, and China hasn't yet cornered the air-taxi market as it has for smaller, aerial combat drones.\n\n\"When we can fundamentally go further and faster than a helicopter, then we have a tool that's more powerful than what the Chinese are going to bring to the fight,\" said Beta's CEO, Kyle Clark.\n\nCommercial air-taxi designs are typically electric. Swapping the electric battery for a hybrid engine will help the aircraft carry more weight and travel farther, a key consideration for the Pentagon, executives from Joby and Beta told Business Insider.\n\nArcher, Joby, and Beta are all developing military VTOLs that can fly autonomously. In Beta's battlefield version, a human must plug in destination coordinates for the aircraft, and artificial intelligence can help it navigate to the destination, said Clark. Configuring the aircraft to operate without a pilot makes it lighter than a commercial air taxi, since it doesn't require seats or the safety and avionics systems that are necessary when transporting people, Clark added.\n\nClinching coveted contracts from the Pentagon would add air-taxi manufacturers to a growing list of dual-use companies that sell to commercial clients as well as to the government. Joby is collaborating with traditional defense firm L3Harris on a military VTOL and test-flew a prototype in November. Archer is developing one with Anduril Industries for the US, according to Archer's CEO, Adam Goldstein. Anduril is also developing a military VTOL called Omen in a joint venture with Emirati defense giant Edge Group.\n\nOne of the air-taxi makers' biggest hurdles to commercial adoption is securing Federal Aviation Administration certification, though the Trump administration is attempting to make it easier. In September, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced an FAA program that permits VTOL companies to test-fly piloted and unmanned aircraft before receiving federal certification.\n\nJoby is leading the pack in the certification race, having cleared four of the five stages for commercial clearance. Archer and Joby hope to fly commercially as early as 2026.\n\nFor defense adoption in the US, the companies would need the Defense Department to deem their VTOLs ready to fly, Goldstein said.\n\nTaylor Rains contributed to this story.",

They are also trying to secure deals with flag-carrying countries to make it easier to board the vessels.\n\nEU headquarters said the businessmen “control vessels transporting crude oil or petroleum products, originating in Russia or being exported from Russia, concealing the actual origin of the oil, while practicing irregular and high-risk shipping practices.”\n\nThe four shipping companies targeted are based in the United Arab Emirates, Vietnam and Russia. A statement said they own or manage shadow fleet tankers under sanctions and which transport oil “while practicing irregular and high-risk shipping practices.”\n\nThe sanctions, which were agreed at a meeting of the 27-nation bloc's foreign ministers in Brussels, involve mostly asset freezes and travel bans.\n\nThe EU move adds to growing pressure on the shadow fleet. Last month, Ukraine used domestically produced Sea Baby naval drones to strike two more Russian oil tankers in the Black Sea. Both were under international sanctions.\n\nSeparately, the bloc imposed sanctions on members of Russia’s military intelligence agency, GRU, and a hacking group known as Cadet Blizzard, accusing them of cyber attacks targeting Ukraine, the EU and unnamed NATO allies.\n\nThe EU also added a number of foreign policy analysts and influencers accused of promoting pro-Russian propaganda or conspiracy theories to its sanctions list.",

    "fullText": "Dec 15 (Reuters) - Venezuela's PDVSA was subject to a cyberattack that it blamed on the United States, the state-run oil company said on Monday, adding that its operations were unaffected even though four sources said systems remained down ​with oil cargo deliveries suspended.\n\nTensions are high between the U.S. and Venezuelan governments, with a large-scale U.S. military buildup in ‌the southern Caribbean, U.S. strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats and comments from U.S. President Donald Trump that land operations may begin soon in Venezuela.\n\nThe Venezuelan government ‌has said the U.S. is seeking regime change to take over the country's vast oil reserves. Last week the U.S. Coast Guard seized a very large crude carrier (VLCC) carrying some 1.85 million barrels of Venezuelan heavy oil sold by PDVSA.\n\nPDVSA and the oil ministry said in statements on Monday that the cyberattack was carried out by \"foreign interests in complicity with domestic entities who are seeking to destroy the country's right to sovereign energy ⁠development.\"\n\nThey alleged the attack was part of U.S. efforts ‌to control Venezuela's oil through \"force and piracy.\"\n\nThe U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPDVSA provided no further details, although the company said it had recovered from the attack. Venezuela's government ‍regularly blames problems like blackouts on conspirators from the opposition and foreign entities like the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, without giving evidence.\n\nSources said the effects were ongoing.\n\n\"There's no delivery (of cargoes), all systems are down,\" one company source said.\n\nOil output, refining and domestic distribution were not affected, the sources said, but ​the company on Monday failed to restart administrative systems, forcing workers to keep written records of operations.\n\nTwo other sources said PDVSA ordered ‌administrative and operational workers to disconnect from the company's systems and to limit access of indirect workers to PDVSA's facilities.\n\nLast week's VLCC seizure was the first interception of a tanker or cargo coming from Venezuela, which has been under U.S. sanctions since 2019, and a sign of growing pressure on President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nThe seizure has already led to a sharp fall in Venezuelan oil exports, also hitting crisis-stricken Cuba, which is facing daily power cuts.\n\nMore than 11 million barrels of oil are stuck on board other vessels in Venezuelan ⁠waters since last week. Among the few vessels setting sail are the ​ones chartered by U.S. oil firm Chevron, one of PDVSA's key partners, which continue ​departing under an authorization previously granted by Washington, according to shipping data.\n\nA tanker carrying Russian naphtha for PDVSA and at least four supertankers due to pick up crude cargoes in Venezuela have made u-turns, ship monitoring data ‍showed on Monday.\n\nBenin-flagged tanker Boltaris, which ⁠was carrying some 300,000 barrels of Russian naphtha bound for Venezuela, made a u-turn late last week and is now heading for Europe without having discharged, according to LSEG vessel monitoring data.\n\nAt least four VLCCs that were in PDVSA's schedules to ⁠load crude at Venezuelan ports in the coming weeks have also made u-turns in recent days, monitoring service TankerTrackers.com said.\n\nVenezuela's crude output averaged 1.17 million barrels per ‌day last month according to official figures, while oil exports rose to some 952,000 bpd, according to shipping data.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Reuters; editing by Julia Symmes-Cobb, Nathan Crooks and Nia Williams)",

At this point, you might think you'll need a Christmas miracle to get hired in the waning moments of 2025.\n\nBut unlike Santa Claus, your chances of getting hired in December are real, writes BI's Sarah E. Needleman.\n\nI don't mean to be a Grinch by telling you to spend your holidays applying for jobs. I get the feeling of wanting to shut it down for the year and give it a go in 2026. After all, it's been a brutal year for job seekers.\n\nBut recruiters and hiring managers told Sarah they're not slowing down, so neither should you. In some cases, they need to rush through hirings or risk losing any remaining budget for the year.\n\nAlso, what's the alternative? Wait until the New Year? That just means even more competition as people reevaluate their jobs after bonus season. There's also the risk of another wave of layoffs to kick off the new year, which will increase the candidate pool.\n\nSo set aside the eggnog for a bit and keep plugging away on those applications. Take it from me, it can happen.\n\nMy Business Insider work anniversary? December 10.\n\nJob hunting isn't the only thing you shouldn't hold off on until the New Year.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a cringey LinkedIn influencer, the best time to do something is yesterday; the second-best time is now.\n\nHere are three other things you can check off your to-do list before midnight on December 31:\n\nA new home for the holidays. The holidays can be a great time to go home shopping. In fact, according to one real-estate investor and agent, you could get a better deal. A few days before Christmas is her favorite time to submit an offer because the seller could be distracted or keen to wrap things up before year's end.\n\nInvest then rest. If you're investing for the long haul — which, let's be honest, is the only way you should be investing — the end of the year could be a good time to dive in. Certain investment vehicles, like IRAs, have limits on yearly contributions, meaning you can load up before starting fresh next month.\n\nSilver (dumb)bells. Gyms in January are a mess. Front-run the New Year's resolution crowd and start getting your workouts in now. The last few weeks of December are my favorite: It's mostly empty, and the people there are the gym rats who are always the friendliest.

    "description": "Ukraine has used long-range drones to attack Russian oil platforms as it expands its strikes on the country's energy sector.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine has hit Russian oil platforms in the Caspian Sea with long-range drones three times in a matter of days, a security source told Business Insider on Monday.\n\nIn the most recent attack, drones struck a platform at the Korchagin oil and gas condensate field, causing damage at the facility and forcing it to halt production, said the source in the Security Service of Ukraine, who was only authorized to speak anonymously to discuss sensitive military developments.\n\nThe drone attack is the latest against Russia's energy sector, a critical source of income for Moscow that helps fuel its war efforts in Ukraine. Kyiv has ramped up its deep-strike campaign on key oil and gas facilities and is now targeting infrastructure in the Caspian Sea, hitting activities there for the third time in less than a week.\n\nThe source in the SBU, Ukraine's main internal security agency, said that drones struck the Filanovsky oil production platform last Thursday, marking the first time Kyiv had caused damage to Russian oil infrastructure in the Caspian Sea.\n\nThe following day, Ukrainian drones struck the Filanovsky platform again and also hit the Korchagin platform. The SBU source said that the attacks caused damage at both facilities and forced a suspension of operations.\n\nThe platforms are owned by Lukoil-Nizhnevolzhskneft, a subsidiary of the Russian energy giant Lukoil. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the drone attacks. Additionally, neither Russia's defense ministry nor its US embassy responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe SBU source said that the agency is working to deny Russia the critical revenue from its energy sector, which helps finance the war in Ukraine. They said that the Filanovsky deposit is one of Russia's largest, with an estimated 129 million tons of oil.\n\n\"No Russian object working for the war is safe regardless of its location,\" the source said, according to a translation of their remarks shared with Business Insider.\n\nThe repeated targeting of the two Caspian Sea oil platforms appears to signal a new shift for Ukraine as it continues to strike Russian oil and gas infrastructure.\n\nFor months, Ukraine has mostly carried out attacks against oil refineries, ports, and other facilities across Russia. However, in recent weeks, Kyiv has expanded these operations beyond land and intensified its strikes on maritime targets.\n\nJust before the three strikes in the Caspian Sea, Ukraine used its naval drones packed with explosives to attack three tankers allegedly belonging to the Russian \"shadow fleet,\" a collection of hundreds of vessels that Moscow uses to move oil and circumvent sanctions on its energy exports.\n\nUkrainian officials have described the campaign against the Russian energy sector as \"long-range\" sanctions. The deep-strike campaign has been a bright spot for Kyiv in this war as Moscow's forces continue to make slow but costly gains on the battlefield.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine has repeatedly urged its international partners to do more to prevent Russia from exporting oil and earning cash to fuel its invasion.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The volume of Venezuelan oil already headed to China before the U.S. seized a Venezuelan tanker last week, plus a glut of crude in storage and weak demand, will limit ​the near-term impact of the move in the Chinese market, traders and analysts said.\n\nExports from the South American producer have ‌fallen sharply since the U.S. seized a tanker off Venezuela's coast and imposed new sanctions on shipping firms and vessels doing business with it, with the prospect of further ‌seizures deterring shipments.\n\nChina, the world's no. 1 oil importer, is the biggest buyer of Venezuelan crude, though Venezuelan supply accounts for only around 4% of its total crude imports.\n\nVenezuelan oil arrivals to China are on track to rise this month and next, traders and analysts say, thanks to a spate of exports over the previous four months, deepening discounts on crude that can take up to 60 days to reach the independent refiners ⁠that are its main buyers.\n\n\"The surge in Venezuela ‌flow to China increased in anticipation of sanctions,\" said Mukesh Sahdev, founder & CEO of energy consultancy XAnalysts. He predicted that the impact of the tanker seizure, and any additional sanctions or seizures, would be seen in ‍February.\n\nDecember China arrivals of Merey crude, Venezuela's main export grade, are expected to exceed 600,000 barrels per day, according to analysts at tanker tracker Vortexa. Kpler puts December Merey arrivals at 664,000 bpd, subject to revision, which it said would be a record.\n\nMOUNTING VOLUMES OF OIL IN FLOATING STORAGE\n\nThe Venezuelan supply comes ​on top of ample deliveries from other sanctioned producers Russia and Iran, which have led to mounting volumes of oil in floating ‌storage in Asia.\n\nAsian floating oil storage hit 71 million barrels last week, rising from 53 million barrels at end-October and about 33 million barrels in early September, Kpler data showed, adding to pressure that had deepened discounts on Venezuelan crude.\n\nAt least one-third of the estimated 650,000 bpd of Merey discharged in November in China is still looking for end-buyers, said Vortexa analyst Emma Li.\n\nTwo trade sources said plentiful Russian and Iranian supply, along with barrels on the way to China from Venezuela, had limited market worries for now.\n\nAnother trading manager at a regular ⁠buyer said it would take time to gauge the impact of the seizure ​on supplies, but that his company had shifted to buying \"small amounts\" of Canadian TMX ​crude to hedge against geopolitical risk.",

    "fullText": "A 1,000-strong \"dark fleet\" of rogue oil tankers skirting sanctions has emerged as a new target for the U.S. and Ukraine, a senior maritime intelligence analyst claims.\n\nMichelle Wiese Bockmann warned the aging fleet poses geopolitical risks and threats of $1 billion oil spills, with the recent U.S. seizures in Venezuela and Ukrainian drone strikes in the Black Sea marking a turning point for both nations in their efforts.\n\n\"There are about 1,000 vessels worldwide that are trading sanctioned crude tankers containing sanctioned Iranian, Venezuelan and Russian oil,\" Bockmann told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"These vessels are a lifeline for these regimes, because they’re used for shipping oil to fund the war in Ukraine, and also give money to the illicit Maduro regime,\" she added.\n\nIran Backs Maduro To Keep Latin America Foothold As Trump Increases Pressure On Venezuela\n\n\"This is a brand-new problem for the U.S., and now Ukraine has signaled they are going to target these vessels the same way,\" she said. \"There is a new strategy to deal with this dark fleet, which is the lifeline of sanctioned oil revenues, and now under attack by the U.S. and Ukraine. The strategy is all to counter what we call gray-zone aggression.\"\n\nUs Escalation With Maduro Halts Deportation Flights To Venezuela\n\nRecent Ukrainian naval drone strikes have disabled several tankers in the Black Sea, including the Dashan, part of Russia’s so-called shadow fleet that Ukraine says helps Moscow export oil in defiance of sanctions, according to Reuters.\n\n\"It is dangerous and could be interpreted as a form of gray-zone aggression in order to continue to keep oil revenue flowing,\" Bockmann said.\n\n\"This is all a billion-dollar oil spill catastrophe waiting to happen,\" she added, pointing to the environmental and navigational risks posed by poorly maintained, uninsured ships.\n\nVenezuela Mobilizes Troops, Weapons In Response To Us Warship Buildup In Caribbean\n\nShe said a subset of \"about 350 to 400 vessels at any one time are not only sanctioned but falsely flying flags, which is dangerous,\" because false registration leaves vessels stateless and uninsured, putting crews at risk.\n\n\"This is a huge issue for maritime safety, it’s a menace to the environment, and it entails crew welfare,\" Bockmann said.\n\nThese vessels, she said, are typically \"elderly\" and used solely for sanctioned oil trades. Many also \"manipulate AIS\" to show they are in one place when they are actually elsewhere.\n\nTrump Sends World's Most Powerful Warship To Latin America — Historic Echoes Of Regime Change\n\n\"They use false flagging, but also spoofing and manipulating its AIS to show it's in one place when it's not. These vessels have also gone to fraudulent registries that don't exist, which means they have no insurance,\" she said. \"Their certificates of seaworthiness are invalid, and they have relied on international maritime conventions to have what's called the ‘right of innocent passage’ so they can't get intercepted.\"\n\nBockmann said U.S. forces have used legal tools including Article 110 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which allows boarding of stateless vessels, to stop these ships.\n\n\"It's my belief that they used Article 110, and they got on board that vessel, and they were absolutely entitled to remove that vessel from global trade,\" she said.\n\nVenezuela Accuses Us Of 'Piracy' After Seizing Massive Oil Tanker\n\nIn the Caribbean, U.S. forces recently seized the tanker Skipper, sanctioned in 2022 and found to be masking its location, under a federal warrant as part of a broader campaign to disrupt illicit oil shipping.\n\n\"The recent Venezuelan tanker was carrying 1.8 million barrels of oil uninsured, so that's a billion-dollar maritime disaster waiting to happen,\" Bockmann said.\n\nAs reported by Fox News Digital, Dec. 12 saw Attorney General Pam Bondi frame the U.S. seizure of a Venezuelan crude tanker as a sanctions-enforcement action rooted in a federal court warrant.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Black Sea, Ukraine targeted multiple alleged \"shadow fleet\" tankers with sea drones, according to Reuters.\n\n\"The three tankers that have been targeted by Ukraine are all in ballast, which means that they weren't carrying oil,\" Bockmann said.\n\n\"That was carefully chosen, and they were also falsely flagged, just like in the recent case of the three tankers attacked in Ukraine. That flag was Gambia. In the U.S. case of Skipper, the flag was Guyana,\" Bockmann said.\n\nFox News Digital's Morgan Phillips contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article",

    "description": "Snacking on junk food can disrupt your diet even if you eat healthy meals. A nutritionist recommends her favorite healthy snacks for lasting energy.",
    "fullText": "Eating more snacks can make it easier to stay on track with a healthy diet, according to a top nutritionist — if you pick the right kind of snacks.\n\nResearcher Federica Amati said smart snacking has been a game-changer for her personal eating habits on a busy schedule.\n\n\"If I've got a really busy day, sometimes I don't get time to have a proper lunch. If I have these snacks with me, I'm good and I'm feeling good. If I don't, then I'm ravenous later,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nAmati, medical scientist and head nutritionist at the nutrition app ZOE, has also seen the power of snacking first-hand in her work.\n\nEven if you're careful with most of your diet, snacking on junk food can leave you struggling with metabolic health issues like weight gain, low energy, high cholesterol and high blood sugar, she said. That's backed up by research from ZOE and other experts.\n\n\"Crappy snacks can basically outdo a lot of the greatness you are doing for yourself with good food,\" Amati said. \"Snacking per se isn't good or bad for you, but what you snack on has a massive influence on your metabolic health.\"\n\nShe shared the two foods she always carries for a nutrient-dense boost, and how to optimize your snacking routine for a healthier diet.\n\nAmati's go-to snack combination at work is an apple and a small jar of mixed nuts.\n\nThe pairing of fruit and nuts offers gut-healthy fiber, plant-based protein, and healthy fats — all satiating nutrients that tell your brain you're full.\n\n\"It doesn't have to be some sort of chef situation,\" Amati said.\"It's just about having a very different mentality to snacking. If you are hungry, eat something that's a food.\"\n\nWhat's key is that you reach for whole foods. If you snack on ultra-processed foods, like a granola bar loaded with additives like sugar, fat, and salt, it's easy to overeat.\n\nWhy? Because the nutrients in ultra-processed foods are already broken down, leaving you with less to digest. So, they offer a temporary energy fix but leave you crashing afterward, often leading to overindulgence at your next meal or snack.\n\n\"It's nutritionally pretty void. So though you may temporarily not be so ravenous, your body's not benefiting from it, and your hunger will remain later that day,\" Amati said.\n\nPlus, the benefit of Amati's fruit-and-nuts snack is that it's relatively inexpensive and requires zero prep: just grab and go.\n\nThe specifics aren't crucial — you can make a healthy snack from fruits like berries and other nuts and seeds, from almonds to pepitas.\n\nWhatever you choose to snack on, being proactive about your hunger cues can lead to better results, according to Amati.\n\nEating early helps you stay in tune with your circadian rhythm to feel consistently energized and make better choices throughout the day.\n\n\"We're primed to more efficiently deal with nutrients and with energy storage and distribution from fats or sugars at the beginning of the day,\" she said.\n\nSkimping on early meals and snacks can leave you so hungry by dinner that you double-down on dessert or late-night snacking, often with less-healthy choices.\n\nWhile timing your snacks can be a matter of personal preference, eating when you're hungry but not hangry can stave off temptations for a more balanced diet.\n\n\"You'd be surprised how many people who struggle with their weight or who struggle with poor metabolic health don't eat enough during the day,\" Amati said.",

    "description": "A warehouse worker consumed 8 energy drinks a day to \"stay alert\" at work, which led to a dangerous health condition",
    "fullText": "A “fit and well” man was rushed to the hospital after suffering a stroke caused by blood pressure that was “sky high”\n\nAfter he was discharged, his blood pressure began to rise again, and upon a follow-up visit, he shared with his doctors that he consumes 8 energy drinks a day\n\nThe man was drinking more than 3 times the recommended amount of caffeine\n\nA “fit and well” man’s habit of downing 8 energy drinks a day caused him to have a stroke — and he’s left with lingering damage.\n\nA 54-year-old warehouse worker arrived to the emergency room with numbness, weakness on his left side, and ataxia (trouble with balance and movement), according to a case report in BMJ Journals. He was “normally fit and well,” the report says —  except for his blood pressure.\n\n“His blood pressure was sky high — about 254 over 150 millimeters — yet when you looked at him you’d never know it, because he looked so well. That’s why we call hypertension the silent killer,” Dr. Sunil Munshi, a consulting physician at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust in the United Kingdom, and senior author of the report, told CNN.\n\nNormal blood pressure for a man his age is less than 120 over less than 80, per the American Heart Association. His numbers are classified as a “hypertensive emergency.”\n\nThe blood pressure had caused “a stroke in the deeper part of the brain, the thalamus, which explains the unsteadiness,” Munshi told the outlet. The man, a warehouse worker from the Sherwood district of the English city of Nottingham, was admitted and treated with five different medications to make his blood pressure drop.\n\nAfter he was discharged, his blood pressure began to increase again, leaving doctors baffled — until, as Munshi shares, he told doctors about his energy drink habit.\n\n“Each day he consumed eight highly potent energy drinks to stay alert for his job — two cans at four different times during the day,” Munshi told CNN. “Each of the drinks contained 160 milligrams of caffeine. Suddenly the diagnosis was clear.”\n\nThe Mayo Clinic says that up to 400 milligrams of caffeine a day “seems safe” for most adults; the patient was drinking more than three times that amount.\n\nToo much caffeine can increase your risk of developing cardiovascular disease, according to a study from the American College of Cardiology.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nHe stopped drinking the energy drinks (the specific brand was not identified in the study), and his blood pressure returned to normal. But the lingering impact of his stroke and energy drink habit remain, he told his doctors, per CNN.\n\n“I obviously wasn’t aware of the dangers drinking energy drinks were causing to myself,” he said, explaining he’s “been left with numbness [in my] left hand side hand and fingers, foot and toes even after 8 years.”\n\nAs Munshi explained, there are other ingredients in energy drinks that can contribute to health problems. “Energy drinks that contain caffeine plus taurine produce significantly higher blood pressure than caffeine alone,” he said. “They also contain high levels of glucose — we know sugar damages the blood vessels in diabetes which leads to heart damage.”",

    "fullText": "The high seas are increasingly dangerous territory for autocratic petrostates. On Wednesday, US military and law enforcement agents seized an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast. The ship had reportedly spent at least the past two years ferrying sanctioned crude from Iran and Venezuela, and using transponder tricks to obscure its location.\n\nNabbing the ship marks a drastic escalation in US President Donald Trump’s pressure campaign against Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, one that will be especially painful for Maduro’s deeply oil-reliant budget and that is probably on firmer legal footing than the recent spate of missile strikes on purported drug boats (and that could sting China, the main buyer of Venezuelan oil). The fate of the oil itself is less clear: “We keep it, I guess,” Trump said, which the Venezuelan government called “blatant theft.”\n\nThe bigger picture is that seaborne oil trade is quickly turning into the most exposed Achilles’ heel at the center of major global conflicts. The European Union and G7 are considering aggressive new financial measures against Russia’s “shadow fleet,” which now handles two-thirds of the country’s oil exports. Ukraine is acting more decisively on its own, with a recent string of naval drone attacks that hit five Russian oil vessels in far-flung corners of the globe over 13 days.\n\nIn the past, when Western governments sanctioned an adversary’s oil exports, they were loath to take “kinetic” action against sanction-dodging ships. Shadow vessels could be hard to track; interceptions risk oil spills or violations of international law; and political leaders are always fearful that attempts to squeeze an adversary’s oil revenue can backfire by raising energy prices at home.\n\nBut now, satellite imagery and other open-source data have made it much harder to hide on the high seas. And oil prices are relatively low amidst an oversupplied global market, reducing the risk of significant price blowback. In fact, that market glut is most visible at sea: The total number of barrels currently on ships is 24% higher than the average of the last decade, and the number of sanctioned barrels has leapt 82% in the past year. The seas are awash, in other words, in juicy oil targets.\n\nWould Russia or Venezuela risk a direct engagement with the US Navy in defense of commercial oil vessels? The Pentagon seems to find that unlikely. Still, there’s a lesson here about the security risks faced by both buyers and sellers of seaborne fossil fuels — one that applies to the US as much as its adversaries.",

    "description": "Oil prices stumbled in 2025 on weaker demand and surging supply. One of the world's biggest commodities firms says the dynamic will worsen in 2026.",
    "fullText": "The long-predicted \"super glut\" of oil is expected to hit energy markets in 2026.\n\nTrafigura, one of the world's biggest commodities trading firms, said it believes the oil market will see a flood of new supply at a time when the demand outlook is softening globally.\n\n\"If we look at what is driving the expectations of that super glut, it's hard to see how we don't get there,\" Saad Rahim, the chief economist at Trafigura, said in a video posted with the firm's annual financial results on Tuesday.\n\nThere are two things that feed into the expected glut of crude next year, Rahim said:\n\nThe crude market has already been feeling the effects of the supply-demand imbalance this year. Apart from a brief blip during the Israel-Iran conflict over the summer, oil prices have been trending lower all year. Brent crude, the international benchmark, traded around $62 a barrel on Tuesday, down 18% year-to-date. West Texas Intermediate crude traded around $58 a barrel, down 19% year-to-date.\n\n\"Whether it's a glut or a super glut, it's really hard to get away from that,\" he added, though he noted that factors like tighter sanctions and decreased production among OPEC nations and the US could help with the supply outlook.\n\nIf China, one of the world's largest oil consumers, were to slow its oil purchases, that could be another factor that could usher in the supply glut, he added.\n\nThe firm's view tracks with what other forecasters see for the oil market next year, some of whom have floated the possibility of a supply glut in the past.\n\nIn its November report, the International Energy Agency said it expected the world's oil supply to surge by over 3 million barrels a day in 2026 while demand growth remains \"modest by historical standards.\" The agency added that the balance of the market looked \"increasingly askew.\"",

    "description": "Merck and Duke Energy stand out as rare “safe yield” plays, pairing 3%+ dividends with solid earnings growth, reasonable payout ratios, and durable demand drivers in healthcare and regulated utilities.",
    "fullText": "The Fed just reminded everyone that the path to lower rates won't be a straight line. In late October, policymakers delivered a second cut this year. The benchmark rate was trimmed by 0.25 points to about 3.9%. They aimed to support growth and hiring even though inflation remains above the 2% goal.\n\nShortly after, two Fed officials publicly pushed back against another December reduction. They argue that future moves will depend heavily on incoming data rather than any preset easing script. Markets took the hint quickly as the dollar has bounced, and gold has slumped.\n\nOur exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most. \n\nThat same repricing has pushed investors to focus more on dependable cash flow and balance sheet strength. The search for quality income is undoubtedly why Triumvirate recently highlighted Merck (MRK) and Duke Energy (DUK) as two of the top high-yield stocks to own right now.\n\nSo in a market full of high-yield landmines, what exactly sets Merck and Duke Energy apart as two of the safest dividend stocks income investors can buy right now? Let’s find out.\n\nMerck & Co., with roughly $252.7B in market capitalization, develops human and animal health therapies spanning oncology, vaccines, infectious diseases, and cardiometabolic care. Its dividend profile fits neatly with the “safe high-yield” thesis, with a forward annual dividend of $3.24 per share and a forward yield of 3.09%, plus a next ex-dividend date scheduled for 12/15/25 and a payout ratio of 37.38%.\n\nMRK sits at $102.81 as of Dec. 3, up 3.2% year-to-date (YTD) and 0.82% over the last 52 weeks.\n\nIts valuation picture shows investors paying 12.12x trailing earnings and 0.96x on a PEG basis versus sector medians of 17.87x and 1.86x, signaling a discount multiple for a business still producing solid growth.​\n\nIts dividend looks even sturdier when set against the earnings engine. This latest quarterly report, released for the period ending 09/25, showed total worldwide sales of $17.3B, up 4% year-over-year (YoY), or 3% excluding currency effects. It highlighted KEYTRUDA as the main driver, with sales of $8.1B, climbing 10% reported and 8% on a constant-currency basis. This also broke out WINREVAIR revenue at $360M, up 141%, and CAPVAXIVE sales of $244M, underscoring depth beyond the flagship oncology franchise.\n\nIt noted that GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 slipped to $1.7B, down 24%, or 25% excluding FX, while Animal Health grew 9% to $1.6B, or 7% in constant currency. This translated into GAAP EPS of $2.32 and non‑GAAP EPS of $2.58, with both figures including a $0.10 per‑share charge tied to a milestone payment to LaNova. It also beat the quarter’s $2.36 consensus by $0.22, a 9.32% upside surprise.​",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Congress urged to act against energy-hungry facilities blamed for increasing bills and worsening climate crisis\n\nA coalition of more than 230 environmental groups has demanded a national moratorium on new datacenters in the US, the latest salvo in a growing backlash to a booming artificial intelligence industry that has been blamed for escalating electricity bills and worsening the climate crisis.\n\nThe green groups, including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Food & Water Watch and dozens of local organizations, have urged members of Congress to halt the proliferation of energy-hungry datacenters, accusing them of causing planet-heating emissions, sucking up vast amounts of water and exacerbating electricity bill increases that have hit Americans this year.\n\n“The rapid, largely unregulated rise of datacenters to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans’ economic, environmental, climate and water security,” the letter states, adding that approval of new data centers should be paused until new regulations are put in place.\n\nThe push comes amid a growing revolt against moves by companies such as Meta, Google and Open AI to plow hundreds of billions of dollars into new datacenters, primarily to meet the huge computing demands of AI. At least 16 datacenter projects, worth a combined $64bn, have been blocked or delayed due to local opposition to rising electricity costs. The facilities’ need for huge amounts of water to cool down equipment has also proved controversial, particularly in drier areas where supplies are scarce.\n\nThese seemingly parochial concerns have now multiplied to become a potent political force, helping propel Democrats to a series of emphatic recent electoral successes in governor elections in Virginia and New Jersey as well as a stunning upset win in a special public service commission poll in Georgia, with candidates campaigning on lowering power bill costs and curbing datacenters.\n\nThis threatens to be a major headache for Donald Trump, who has aggressively pushed the growth of AI but also called himself the “affordability president” and vowed to cut energy costs in half in his first year.\n\nHowever, household electricity prices have increased by 13% so far under Trump and the president recently lashed out in the wake of the election losses, calling affordability a “fake narrative” and a “con job” created by Democrats. “They just say the word,” Trump said last week. “It doesn’t mean anything to anybody. They just say it – affordability.”\n\nYet about 80 million Americans are currently struggling to pay their bills for electricity and gas, with many voters regardless of political party blaming datacenters for this, according to Charles Hua, founder and executive director of PowerLines, a non-partisan organization that aims to reduce power bills.\n\n“We saw rising utility bills become a core concern in the New Jersey, Georgia and Virginia elections, which shows us there is a new politics in America – we are entering a new era that is all about electricity prices,” Hua said.\n\n“Nobody in America wants to pay more for electricity and we saw in Georgia a meaningful chunk of conservative voters vote against the Republican incumbents, which was staggering.”\n\nHua said the causes of the electricity cost rises were nuanced, with ageing transmission lines and damage caused by extreme weather also adding to utilities’ costs on top of the surging demand for power.\n\nBut it is the growth of datacenters to service AI – with electricity consumption set to nearly triple over the next decade, equivalent to powering 190m new homes – that is the focus of ire for voters as well as an unlikely sweep of politicians ranging from Bernie Sanders on the left to Marjorie Taylor Greene on the far right.\n\nMore broadly, almost half of Americans say the cost of living in the US, including power, food and other essentials, is the worst they can ever remember it being.\n\nThis focus on affordability has provided a new line of attack for an environmental movement that has struggled to counter Trump’s onslaught upon rules that reduce air and water pollution. The president has called the climate crisis a “hoax” and clean energy a “scam” and has slashed support for and even blocked new wind and solar projects, even though renewables are often the cheapest and fastest options for new power generation.\n\nAt the current rate of growth, datacenters could add up to 44m tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by 2030, equivalent to putting an extra 10m cars on to the road and exacerbating a climate crisis that is already spurring extreme weather disasters and ripping apart the fabric of the American insurance market.\n\nBut it is the impact upon power bills, rather than the climate crisis, that is causing anguish for most voters, acknowledged Emily Wurth, managing director of organizing at Food & Water Watch, the group behind the letter to lawmakers.\n\n“I’ve been amazed by the groundswell of grassroots, bipartisan opposition to this, in all types of communities across the US,” she said. “Everyone is affected by this, the opposition has been across the political spectrum. A lot of people don’t see the benefits coming from AI and feel they will be paying for it with their energy bills and water.\n\n“It’s an important talking point,” Wurth said of the affordability concerns. “We’ve seen outrageous utility price rises across the country and we are going to lean into this. Prices are going up across the board and this is something Americans really do care about.”",
