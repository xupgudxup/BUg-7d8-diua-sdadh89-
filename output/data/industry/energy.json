    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Pronnoy Goswami, 31, who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in 2022, I thought: Why me?\n\nI didn't have lots of bad habits, I hadn't abused my body, and it took me a long time to accept what was happening to me.\n\nI considered giving up my dream of solving meaningful problems in tech at scale, taking a career break to focus on my health, and leaving the US to go back to my home country of India.\n\nUltimately, I stayed in the US and continued with my career while making huge changes to my lifestyle and work routine. I'm proud of what I've achieved in tech in spite of my adversities, and along the way, I've found my voice and a new vision of success.\n\nWhen I first got sick in 2021, I was working in Washington as a software engineer at Microsoft. Previously, I'd spent two years in software engineering at McKinsey, and a few months interning at PayPal. I now work at a large enterprise software company.\n\nI was on a trip with my partner just before Thanksgiving when I had rectal bleeding and felt weak, but I didn't think it was anything more serious than hemorrhoids or food poisoning. My symptoms kept getting worse, even after I consulted doctors and took medication. I was going to the restroom 15 to 20 times a day, and I lost a lot of weight.\n\nDoctors noticed my gut was inflamed, and referred me to a gastroenterologist. I was very scared.\n\nA colonoscopy showed I have ulcerative colitis, a type of inflammatory bowel disease that causes symptoms like abdominal pain and rectal bleeding.\n\nI'm used to putting 100% into my work, and when I was diagnosed in 2022, I'd been working on projects at Microsoft I felt were impactful. I took three to four weeks of sick leave, then returned to work, but I was completely remote for a year after my diagnosis.\n\nMy body struggles to absorb nutrients, and I get tired very quickly. I've had to make many dietary changes to manage flare-ups, including cutting out caffeine, alcohol, lactose, chile, and red meat.\n\nWhen my wife and I went on honeymoon in Hawaii in August 2025, we planned the trip down to the restaurants I could eat at and what I'd order. But then I ate something I hadn't planned at a lūʻau, and I was sick for two days, which was disheartening.\n\nAt first, I was scared to tell people about my condition, but when I started sharing with my colleagues, I found people empathized and judged me according to my merits.\n\nI have bad days related to my condition 20% of the time, and sometimes have to step away for appointments and procedures. For example, I have a colonoscopy every year because ulcerative colitis puts me at higher risk of getting colorectal cancer. I always try to catch up with tasks in my own time, and accept that I have to achieve the same things as others in less time.\n\nI left Microsoft and started working at a large enterprise software company in 2023. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the allure of startups is all around. However, I'm not physically or mentally ready to take the leap of faith to work at one yet. The stability of my current job is vital for my health.\n\nI also need to be careful with what jobs I consider, because a workplace might not be a good fit if it has a strict policy of being in the office five days a week and doesn't make accommodations. Plus, I'm very happy where I am.\n\nBefore I got sick, I took my health for granted, but I've started treating my body like a temple and am careful with how I'm spending my energy. I've come to define success as being healthy, because it helps me solve problems at work better.\n\nIt's also given me a voice. My diagnosis made me want to be more purposeful with my time, so I started exploring creative passions, like writing a newsletter and technical blogs. I want to connect with like-minded people and not live in a shell.\n\nWhen I look back at what I've achieved in my career since my diagnosis, I feel God has been kind to me. I've done interesting, cutting-edge work in tech, like building important infrastructure.\n\nBut I'm not done yet. I'm still in the early innings of my career, and I have a long way to go.\n\nMicrosoft declined to respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nDo you have a story to share about navigating a diagnosis alongside your career?

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — It is pre-dawn in the historic Podil district of the Ukraine capital, Kyiv, and warm light from the Spelta bakery-bistro’s window pierces the darkness outside. On a wooden surface dusted with flour, the baker Oleksandr Kutsenko skilfully divides and shapes soft, damp pieces of dough. As he shoves the first loaves into the oven, a sweet, delicate aroma of fresh bread fills the space.\n\nWhat economic risks do energy attacks pose to Ukraine?\n\nHow are labor shortages impacting Ukrainian companies?\n\nHow are power outages affecting Ukrainian business operations?\n\nWhat additional costs are Ukrainian businesses facing during wartime?\n\nSeconds later the lights go out, the ovens switch off and darkness envelops the room. Kutsenko, 31, steps outside into the freezing night, switches on a large rectangular generator and the power kicks back in. It’s a pattern that will be repeated many times as the business struggles to keep working through the power outages caused by Russia’s bombing campaign on Ukraine's energy grid.\n\n“It’s now more than impossible to imagine a Ukrainian business operating without a generator,” said Olha Hrynchuk, the co-founder and head baker of Spelta.\n\nThe cost of purchasing and operating generators to overcome power outages is just one of many challenges facing Ukrainian businesses after nearly four years of war. Acute labor shortages due to mobilization and war-related migration, security risks, declining purchasing power and complicated logistics add to the pressure, officials say.\n\nHrynchuk, 28, opened the bakery 10 months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. That winter was the first year Russia targeted Ukraine’s energy system. Hrynchuk says they barely know what it is to work under “normal” conditions, but have never faced the challenges they do now.\n\nProduction is entirely dependent on electricity and the generator burns about 700 hryvnias ($16) worth of fuel per hour.\n\n“We run on a generator for 10 to 12 hours a day. You have no fixed schedule — you have to adapt and refuel it at the same time,” Hrynchuk said.\n\nOlha Nasonova, 52, who is head of the Restaurants of Ukraine analytical center, says the industry is experiencing its most difficult period of the past 20 years.\n\nWhile businesses were prepared for electricity cuts, no one expected such a cold winter and it’s been especially tough for small cafés and family-run establishments, because they have the least financial resources.\n\nThe “Best Way to Cup” project, which has two venues and roasts and grinds its own coffee, is on the brink of permanent closure. Co-founder Yana Bilym, 33, who opened the cafe in May, said a Russian attack shattered all its windows and glass doors in August. Bilym said the cost of renovation was 150,000 hryvnias (about $3,400), half of which she financed with a bank loan that she only recently finished repaying.",

    "title": "‘Disaster waiting to happen': Fracking boom put hundreds of tanks in Guadalupe River floodplain",
    "description": "Lack of a state floodplain policy in Texas enabled oil companies to build in areas hit by an epic inundation less than 30 years ago.",
    "fullText": "GONZALES - More than 500 enormous oil tanks dot the floodplains of the Guadalupe River and its tributaries across one of Texas' leading oil fields, posing risk of environmental disaster in a flood climatologists say is almost certain to come.\n\nLongtime residents of this area's historic ranchlands vividly remember the last time these plains filled with water, in a biblical inundation in 1998. But that was before the fracking boom that hit the region because of the oil-rich geological formation that lies beneath it, known as the Eagle Ford Shale.\n\nToday, a repeat of the historic flood could wreak havoc, an Inside Climate News investigation has found.\n\n\"There's a whole lot of tanks full of oil that are going to float away,\" said Sara Dubose, a fifth-generation landowner in Gonzales County with 10 tanks in the floodplain on her family's ranchlands, each holding up to 21,000 gallons of oil or toxic wastewater. \"Spill all over our land and ruin it for 100 years.\"\n\nAlmost 20 feet of water could submerge some of the tanks on the Dubose family's land in a flooding event similar to 1998, according to an analysis of data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nInside Climate News scoured satellite imagery of the area to identify batteries of oil tanks and other oil field infrastructure in the Eagle Ford Shale near waterways in the Guadalupe River Basin. Using latitude and longitude coordinates of each tank battery, the analysis used FEMA flood mapping data to extract the agency's estimates for the depths of its benchmark flood scenarios at each location.\n\nIn some areas, the 1998 flood exceeded the worst-case scenario considered by disaster planners. FEMA calls it the \"500-year flood,\" a hypothetical event the agency estimates has a 0.2% chance of happening in any year.\n\nToday, a 500-year flood across the entire area analyzed would cover at least 22 tank batteries containing 144 individual oil and wastewater tanks with 10 or more feet of water. Of those, 12 tanks would sit beneath at least 20 feet of water.\n\nFEMA's estimates for a 500-year flood understate present risk in many locations, research shows, as warming air and oceans continue to fuel an intensification of extreme rainfall.\n\nDubose experienced the 1998 flood, when the Guadalupe River sprang from its banks and filled the shallow valleys at the edge of these coastal plains. The water almost reached her house, 7 miles from the river, where it trapped her for a week, covering U.S. 183 in both directions as it drained slowly into San Antonio Bay on the coast.\n\nIn a warming world with more intense rainfall, a future flood could be even more severe.\n\n\"One day, it's going to happen,\" Dubose said. \"We've all been concerned about the oil field flooding.\"\n\nWhen flooding hit a smaller oil field in 2013 in northeastern Colorado, authorities tallied two dozen overturned tanks and almost 90,000 gallons of oil and wastewater spilled. During Hurricane Katrina in 2005, millions of gallons of oil spilled when several supersized storage tanks floated off their pads. In 1994, flooding on the San Jacinto River in East Texas severed eight pipelines, ignited massive fires, injured hundreds of people and released more than 2 million gallons of petroleum products.\n\nLast summer, severe flooding in the Texas Hill Country near Kerrville washed away a girls' summer camp and killed more than 100 people along the Guadalupe River, 150 miles upstream from the Eagle Ford Shale.\n\nThe rules for building in floodplains in Texas fall to county governments, often small and rural. The 78 tank batteries in the Guadalupe floodplains analyzed all sit within Gonzales and DeWitt counties, which have a combined population of about 40,000 people.\n\nIt was left to the governments of the two counties to design and implement floodplain policies during the shale oil boom.\n\n\"Those are not issues that most counties, on an individual basis, are well suited to handle,\" said Todd Votteler, former executive manager of science, intergovernmental relations and policy at the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority. \"It raises a question of how serious the state is about avoiding future flood damage in high-risk areas if we don't have a statewide policy.\"\n\nTank batteries at well sites aren't typically secured to the ground by anything but the weight of the equipment and the oil and wastewater inside them. While they are especially vulnerable, they aren't the only industry infrastructure that could be affected by flooding. Eight oil pipelines and about two dozen gas pipelines also cross the Guadalupe River in the Eagle Ford Shale, and others cross local creeks.\n\nThe batteries in the floodplain on Dubose's property were previously operated by Canadian firm Baytex Energy, which sold all of its Eagle Ford Shale assets in November for $3.2 billion to an undisclosed buyer. Other operators with numerous batteries in the floodplains include EOG Resources, Devon Energy and Burlington Resources, a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips. None of those companies responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe floodplains also contain many open and buried pits of drilling waste. Dubose unsuccessfully sued an oil company in 2018, alleging that the unlined pit where it buried drilling mud and wastewater on her property was responsible for the orange, gassy goo that seeped up from the earth during heavy rainfall.\n\n\"Think about all the stuff that's soaked into the ground,\" said David Muir, a fifth-generation landowner with more than a dozen wells on his property. \"They've got thousands of chemicals that go into the drilling mud.\"\n\nMuir's land has been in his family since the 1840s. Outside his old, single-story ranch house near the border of Gonzales and DeWitt counties, a private airplane hangar and a waterpark-style swimming pool commemorate the riches fracking has brought to the region.\n\nInside the house between clamoring dogs, Muir sifted through boxes of photos that predated the shale boom. He pulled out strips of 11 film photos taped together to show the vast landscape of water that overtook this rolling savannah on the morning of Oct. 17, 1998.\n\nIt rose far past the tops of the trees. It even covered a spot on Muir's land where a tank battery now stands, 1.5 miles from the Guadalupe River.\n\n\"I thought the whole world was going to flood,\" he said as he flipped through the old pictures. \"We haven't had a flood like that since the oil field hit us.\"\n\nIt all seemed to happen in minutes, recalled Ben Prause, a former elected executive of DeWitt County who presided during the flood. The water wasn't even raging but almost calm as it swiftly rose up to swallow about two-thirds of the town of Cuero. In one case, he said, sheriff's deputies entered a home with water to their knees to save an old woman. When they walked out minutes later, the water was at their chests.\n\n\"It was so rapid,\" said Prause, 92, at his home in downtown Cuero, a few blocks from the 1998 waterline. \"It was just terrible. Water was everywhere.\"\n\nIt wasn't just the Guadalupe River, he said. Several major tributaries also flooded to make the situation worse. Torrential rains hit the upper reaches of Plum Creek and Sandies Creek, which both gushed simultaneously into the Guadalupe.\n\n\"What made it so bad is they all hit about the same time,\" he said.\n\nThese creeks barely trickle for most of the year, said Prause, a 1950 graduate of Cuero High School, but on rare occasions their large floodplains fill.\n\nIn 1998 the floodwaters south of Gonzales were several miles wide, said a report issued the next year by the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority and FEMA, exceeding predicted worst-case scenarios in some areas.\n\n\"It was the flood that many thought would never happen,\" the report said. \"Unfortunately, an even greater flood will occur sometime in the future.\"\n\nThe 1998 flood caused a few oil spills, said James Dodson, 71, co-founder of the San Antonio Bay Partnership and the son of a South Texas pipeline technician. His late wife worked for Texas' environmental regulator and spent weeks overseeing cleanups. But the extent of oil field infrastructure at that time was nothing compared with today.\n\n\"That was long before the Eagle Ford Shale plays came along,\" he said. \"The landscape was so much different in that regard - there's so many more facilities and well pads now.\"\n\nToday, along one eastward turn in the Guadalupe's snaking course, three batteries consisting of 15 tanks would sit under about 20 feet of water in a 500-year flood. One of them, operated by EOG Resources, is just 500 feet from the riverbank.\n\nTwo miles from the Guadalupe River, four tanks operated by Burlington Resources would take on almost 23 feet of water.\n\nNear Boggy Creek, east of the Guadalupe River by the small town of Dreyer, 10 feet of water would cover EOG Resources' Shiner Hub gas processing plant, a complex of 14 tanks, pipes, motors, chemical separators and flares.\n\nAlong Peach Creek, southeast of Gonzales, batteries of 12 and 28 tanks previously operated by Baytex Energy would sit under 13 feet and 8 feet of water, respectively.\n\nThe oil from toppled tanks probably wouldn't spill onto the land around them, said Dodson, a former water department director for the city of Corpus Christi who worked South Texas oil fields in the 1970s. Instead, he predicted, it would float on the water and end up at the edge of the flood's crest, like the rings in a bathtub. More of it, he said, would wash over the creeks and estuaries of San Antonio Bay and into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\"It's a disaster waiting to happen,\" said Sister Elizabeth Riebschlager, an 89-year-old Catholic nun from Cuero. \"They have these oil wells all through these areas that flooded like it's no problem.\"\n\nThe oil field infrastructure dates back less than 20 years to the shale revolution, when innovations in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing unleashed an explosion of new oil exploration.\n\nBack then, Riebschlager, the daughter of a local civic leader, conducted town hall meetings for local families baffled by the swarm of businessmen and lawyers descending on their sleepy countryside, whipping up 100-page contracts and casually writing checks for mind-boggling sums.\n\nMany landowners warned the oil companies about flooding, she said.\n\nRiebschlager related the story of one rancher: \"When they were getting ready to drill there, he said, ‘Please don't drill them here, it's a floodplain. They will flood.' The oil man says, ‘Don't worry, we'll have all the oil and gas out of this ground before the next flood.' ‘\n\nDubose, who missed out on the riches of the oil boom because her mother sold her family's mineral rights, got a similar answer when she mentioned the 1998 floods to the company drilling on her land. She recalls a man telling her: ‘That was a 100-year flood so it won't happen for another 100 years.'\n\nThat's a common misconception surrounding terms like a 100-year and the 500-year flood, said Matthew Berg, CEO of Houston-based water risk management firm Simfero. A former water specialist with Texas A&M AgriLife, he understands why the general public is misled.\n\n\"They would understand a 100-year flood only happens once every 100 years,\" he said. \"That's a problem because statistics don't work that way.\"\n\nSuch flood events don't literally return only once every century. Rather, computer models estimate that such an event has a 1% chance of occurring at any given spot in a year. What happened in previous years doesn't change those odds.\n\nFurthermore, Berg said, these estimated probabilities are \"to some extent meaningless\" where records go back barely 100 years. They are meant for purposes of development planning, not weather forecasting. The likelihood of storms across centuries isn't known. Neither is when the 500-year floodplain of the Guadalupe River may fill up again. Two things are certain, though: It will fill again and the chances are increasing.\n\nThe warming climate is making precipitation more intense in Texas and beyond. A similar amount of rain falls in fewer, more concentrated storms than it used to, according to a 2024 report from the Office of the Texas State Climatologist at Texas A&M University.\n\n\"Many studies have documented an increase in extreme rainfall in Texas and surrounding areas,\" the report said. \"Extreme rainfall is strongly affected by increased temperatures.\"\n\nIn Texas, as elsewhere on the planet, all 10 of the warmest years on record have occurred since 2011. Warming is a result of the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, released in large part by burning fossil fuels like the oil in the tanks sitting in the floodplains across the Eagle Ford Shale. And warmer air can hold more water vapor, leading to heavier downpours.\n\nIf global fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions continue to climb, so will extreme rainfall.\n\n\"Extreme precipitation is expected to increase in intensity on average statewide,\" the state climatologist's report said. \"We anticipate an additional increase of about 10% in expected extreme rainfall intensity in 2036 compared to 2001-2020 and an overall increase of over 20% compared to 1950-1999.\"\n\nThose changes in rainfall intensity correspond to a 50% increase in the likelihood of extreme precipitation compared to 2001-2020, the report said, and a 100% increase compared to 1950-1999.\n\nHowever, heavy rains alone don't always make a mega-flood. They have to fall on just the right areas, across multiple tributaries of a single river so that their waters all converge at once downstream.\n\nIf a 500-year flood returns to the Eagle Ford Shale, it's hard to tell how much oil, wastewater and other petroleum fluids could spill. Conventional oil field tanks range from 210 to 750 barrels in size, or from 13,000 to 32,000 gallons. Typical tank batteries in the Eagle Ford often include five 500-barrel oil tanks and one 500-barrel wastewater tank, according to an investor presentation by Baytex Energy. Some are out of use or empty, some are full, most are in between.\n\nWhatever fluids wash down the river would flow into San Antonio Bay, part of the winter grounds for the world's last flock of wild, endangered whooping cranes, then into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\"With a flood, it causes a lot more dispersion. It breaks it up then you've got oil mixed with sediment and debris. It can stink and it's much, much harder to clean up,\" said Diane Wilson, founder of San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper and a 77-year-old former shrimper who lives near the mouth of the Guadalupe River. \"It would be unbelievable, the damage it could do.\"\n\nLast summer, Dubose said, she thought it was about to happen. As soon as she saw the news late at night on the Fourth of July, she rushed out and sped her white Hummer down ranch roads to the river.\n\nIncredible rainfall was hitting the Guadalupe about 150 miles upstream in the Hill Country. Online posts said the water had washed away a summer camp for girls.\n\nDubose had flashbacks to 1998, when there were also overnight rainstorms far upriver that put this region underwater for a week. So she hurried to save a mobile home parked at her fishing camp by the river, the same spot where she'd lost a mobile home in 1998.\n\nAlmost there, she passed nervously between the towering, three-story tank batteries in the floodplain on her land, then past the site of the buried waste where, she said, the grass dies each time heavy rains bring the water table to the surface.\n\nLuckily for Dubose, no torrent came downriver. For Kerrville, in the Hill Country, it was the worst flood since 1987. But all the heavy rain fell upstream of a major dam and reservoir, where water levels were low enough to absorb it. So the Eagle Ford Shale was spared, for now.\n\n\"What happened in Kerrville, if that happens here, that's a really bad situation,\" Dubose said. \"We've told the oil field, this is going to flood someday.\"\n\nThis report is published in partnership with Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, independent news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment.\n\nThis article originally published at ‘Disaster waiting to happen': Fracking boom put hundreds of tanks in Guadalupe River floodplain.",

    "description": "(Reuters) Feb 8 - On the edge of Venezuela’s main oil city Maracaibo, members of a local branch of the ruling socialist party went door-to-door in the weeks after U.S. forces captured President",
    "fullText": "(Reuters) Feb 8 - On the edge of Venezuela’s main oil city Maracaibo, members of a local branch of the ruling socialist party went door-to-door in the weeks after U.S. forces captured President Nicolas Maduro, asking residents if they still supported the party that has run the country for nearly 20 years. The result: about half of members said they no longer did.\n\n“The response is very bad,” said a person who helped lead the effort. “There is division among us.”\n\nWhile Reuters was not able to independently verify the canvassing results, the reported drop in support aligned with ​information gathered from three other parts of the country.\n\nThe news agency spoke to 13 party members or local leaders across four states who reported fractures in the United Socialist Party (PSUV) following the U.S. attack. All of them expressed a deep sense of uncertainty and many voiced worries about their economic future.\n\nThe government’s ‌patronage system, which bought a form of party loyalty through financial benefits and food parcels, also appears to be under pressure, with five of the sources saying some contributions had stopped since Maduro’s capture.\n\nSix of the people described distrust among party loyalists and spreading suspicion of interim President Delcy Rodriguez. Eight said they had seen a drop in participation and support at their local party branch, with two of them estimating a ‌70% fall in attendance at events like marches and local assembly meetings.\n\nThe people Reuters spoke to all requested anonymity for fear of reprisal, with several saying local leaders were encouraging the party faithful to snitch on any members losing faith in the cause, a common tactic for weeding out popular dissent in Venezuela. Reuters has withheld the names of the people it interviewed to protect their safety.\n\nThere are no recent public numbers on party membership and while Reuters talked to people observing falling participation in four geographically dispersed states, the news agency could not determine what the situation was across all 24 states in the country. Most foreign media do not have permanent staff in the country and Venezuelans are generally reluctant to speak freely with reporters because of potential reprisals.\n\nNeither the Venezuelan government nor PSUV responded to Reuters requests for comment on the eroding support for the party and the fraying of its patronage system.\n\nCalls for national unity in the face of threats to Venezuela have been a constant in Rodriguez’s speeches and public appearances since Maduro's removal, and she has also cheered the resilience of the ⁠country's people and pledged economic development for all.\n\nDespite decrying Maduro’s detention as a kidnapping, Rodriguez appears to be complying with ‌U.S. demands to open the country to American oil companies and has also met with the director of the Central Intelligence Agency to discuss cooperation against drug trafficking.\n\nFraying party support at the grassroots level would be a problem for Rodriguez. Reuters has previously reported how she is already battling to shore up her rule by putting allies in positions of power to shield herself from the potential threat posed by Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, who also heads the PSUV and has close connections to the security services and colectivos - the hardline motorcycle-riding ‍enforcement arm of the party.\n\nPublicly, Cabello has stressed unity. On Jan. 12, he used his weekly press conference as party leader to emphasize Rodriguez has \"all the support of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela.”\n\nNeither U.S. President Donald Trump nor Rodriguez has seriously addressed the question of elections since Maduro’s ouster, but the anecdotal dwindling of local support appears to point to an uncomfortable truth for the PSUV: Maduro’s exit has done little to improve popularity, according to the party members Reuters interviewed.\n\nA local party leader in the northern state of Aragua said the party had no way to grow or ​win elections, “even if we had Che Guevara or Gandhi as a candidate.\"\n\n“You have a situation where the apparatus of repression is fragmenting and on top of that the remaining grassroots base is demobilizing. That’s a huge challenge for governability,” said Ricardo Rios, head of Caracas-based analysis and consultancy firm Poder & Estrategia.\n\nStill, local support for the party ‌may revive. Venezuela has already received $500 million from crude sales and any significant economic improvement could help boost funding of the party and get membership perks, which have historically helped buttress support, flowing again.\n\nIn response to Reuters questions about the problems facing the Socialist Party, a senior White House official said: “The country is stable, illegal migration has stopped, drug flows have halted, and the new oil deal will generate economic prosperity for both the Venezuelan and American people.\"\n\nAll of Venezuela's top officials are long-time members of the PSUV. The party was created in 2007 by merging the disparate political and social forces that swept socialist President Hugo Chavez to power in 1999. That movement also came to bear his name - ‘Chavismo.’\n\nThe reasons given for falling local support varied. Some said people were wary of being associated with the party if the opposition were to win power, fearing some form of retribution. Others said uncertainty was causing infighting in ⁠the party. Nearly all spoke of disillusionment and questioned the loyalty of the new leadership to the Chavista cause.\n\nAdding to people’s hardship are problems with the delivery of party handouts, both food and ​financial, that have hit local branches, five sources said. They said members in three states - Zulia, Aragua and Falcon – were deserting the party because the government had stopped making bonus payments and distributing welfare. Reuters ​was not able to independently verify the information it gathered about stalling handouts.\n\nGovernment payments, which through various different benefits can for some add up to over $100 a month, are a vital income for millions in Venezuela, where the monthly minimum wage is less than $1 and poverty is rampant. Inflation is also estimated by analysts to have topped 400% in 2025.\n\nThe complexity of Venezuela's welfare system, with an array of benefits delivered at different times to different people, meant Reuters was unable to get a complete picture of the status of all payments and food ‍parcels, with some of those interviewed saying certain bonuses were still arriving while others were ⁠not.\n\nOne source in Zulia state said that in their district 600 people had not received their “family bonus”, a direct welfare payment of up to $65 given to help with living costs. Three sources also reported that food parcels, known as CLAP, have not been delivered, with some adding that problems with these deliveries predate the capture of Maduro but have continued since.\n\nIn the municipality of Mara, in the northwest border with Colombia, one party member said there were old-school Socialist Party members still committed to the cause and “clapping like seals” but that even they are “turning because they haven't been paid their bonuses.\"\n\nAbout 70% of local party members and ⁠public employees in Mara ignored calls to participate in two recent pro-Maduro marches, the person said, leading bosses to threaten people with firings. Reuters could not establish the size of the marches or if there were any firings as a result.\n\nFour of the people Reuters spoke to reported that even the motorbike-riding ‘colectivos’ were attending fewer events and have not been mobilized to push people into public support of the government. Their ‌members have been responsible for killing opposition figures and anti-government protesters, according to reports, which Reuters has not independently confirmed, from organizations like Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe person in Mara said many colectivo members are now working as motorbike taxi drivers, failing to show up to marches despite threats from ‌local authorities to revoke their mototaxi work permits, the person said. \"They hide, they fake an illness and a few have gone to Colombia.\"",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Italian police fired tear gas and a water cannon at dozens of protesters who threw firecrackers and tried to access a highway near a Winter Olympics venue on Saturday.\n\nThe brief confrontation came at the end of a peaceful march by thousands against the environmental impact of the Games and the presence of U.S. agents in Italy.\n\nPolice held off the violent demonstrators, who appeared to be trying to reach the Santagiulia Olympic ice hockey rink, after the skirmish. By then, the larger peaceful protest, including families with small children and students, had dispersed.\n\nEarlier, a group of masked protesters had set off smoke bombs and firecrackers on a bridge overlooking a construction site about 800 meters (a half-mile) from the Olympic Village that's housing around 1,500 athletes.\n\nPolice vans behind a temporary metal fence secured the road to the athletes’ village, but the protest veered away, continuing on a trajectory toward the Santagiulia venue. A heavy police presence guarded the entire route.\n\nThere was no indication that the protest and resulting road closure interfered with athletes’ transfers to their events, all on the outskirts of Milan.\n\nThe demonstration coincided with U.S. Vice President JD Vance’s visit to Milan as head of the American delegation that attended the opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nHe and his family visited Leonardo da Vinci's “The Last Supper” closer to the city center, far from the protest, which also was against the deployment of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to provide security to the U.S. delegation.\n\nU.S. Homeland Security Investigations, an ICE unit that focuses on cross-border crimes, frequently sends its officers to overseas events like the Olympics to assist with security. The ICE arm at the forefront of the immigration crackdown in the U.S. is known as Enforcement and Removal Operations, and there is no indication its officers are being sent to Italy.\n\nAt the larger, peaceful demonstration, which police said numbered 10,000, people carried cardboard cutouts to represent trees felled to build the new bobsled run in Cortina. A group of dancers performed to beating drums. Music blasted from a truck leading the march, one a profanity-laced anti-ICE anthem.\n\n“Let’s take back the cities and free the mountains,” read a banner by a group calling itself the Unsustainable Olympic Committee. Another group called the Association of Proletariat Excursionists organized the cutout trees.\n\n“They bypassed the laws that usually are needed for major infrastructure project, citing urgency for the Games,” said protester Guido Maffioli, who expressed concern that the private entity organizing the Games would eventually pass on debt to Italian taxpayers.\n\nHomemade signs read “Get out of the Games: Genocide States, Fascist Police and Polluting Sponsors,” the final one a reference to fossil fuel companies that are sponsors of the Games. One woman carried an artificial tree on her back decorated with the sign: “Infernal Olympics.”\n\nThe demonstration followed another last week when hundreds protested the deployment of ICE agents.\n\nLike last week, demonstrators Saturday said they were opposed to ICE agents’ presence, despite official statements that a small number of agents from an investigative arm would be present in U.S. diplomatic territory, and not operational on the streets.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The U.S. has given Ukraine and Russia a June deadline to reach a deal to end the nearly four‑year war, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters, as Russian strikes on energy infrastructure forced nuclear power plants to cut output on Saturday.\n\nIf the June deadline is not met, the Trump administration will likely put pressure on both sides to meet it, he added.\n\n“The Americans are proposing the parties end the war by the beginning of this summer and will probably put pressure on the parties precisely according to this schedule,” Zelenskyy said, speaking to reporters on Friday. Zelenskyy’s comments were embargoed until Saturday morning.\n\n“And they say that they want to do everything by June. And they will do everything to end the war. And they want a clear schedule of all events,” he said.\n\nHe said the U.S. proposed holding the next round of trilateral talks next week in their country for the first time, likely in Miami, Zelenskyy said. “We confirmed our participation,” he added.\n\nZelenskyy said Russia presented the U.S. with a $12 trillion economic proposal — which he dubbed the “Dmitriev package” after Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev. Bilateral economic deals with the U.S. form part of the broader negotiating process.\n\nRussian strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure continued with over 400 drones and about 40 missiles launched overnight Saturday, Zelenskyy said in a post on X. Targets included the energy grid, generation facilities and distribution networks.\n\nUkrenergo, the state energy transmission operator, said the attack was the second mass strike on energy infrastructure since the start of the year, forcing nuclear power plants to reduce output. Eight facilities in eight regions came under attack, it said in a statement.\n\n“As a result of missile strikes on key high-voltage substations that ensured the output of nuclear power units, all nuclear power plants in the territories under control were forced to reduce their load,” the statement said.\n\nIt said the power deficit in the country has increased “significantly” as a result of the attacks forcing an extension of hourly power outages in all regions of Ukraine.\n\nThe latest deadline follows U.S.-brokered trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi that produced no breakthrough as the warring parties cling to mutually exclusive demands. Russia is pressing Ukraine to withdraw from the Donbas, where fighting remains intense — a condition Kyiv says it will never accept.\n\n“Difficult issues remained difficult. Ukraine once again confirmed its positions on the Donbas issue. ‘We stand where we stand’ is the fairest and most reliable model for a ceasefire today, in our opinion,” Zelenskyy said. He reiterated that the most challenging topics would be reserved for a trilateral meeting between leaders.\n\nZelenskyy said no common ground was reached on managing the Russian‑held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and expressed skepticism about a U.S. proposal to turn the Donbas region, coveted by Russia, into a free economic zone as a compromise.\n\n“I do not know whether this can be implemented, because when we talked about a free economic zone, we had different views on it,” he said.\n\nHe said in the last round of talks the negotiators discussed how a ceasefire would be technically monitored. He added that the U.S. has reaffirmed it would play a role in that process.\n\nRepeated Russian aerial assaults have in recent months focused on Ukraine’s power grid, causing blackouts and disrupting the heating and water supply for families during a bitterly cold winter, putting more pressure on Kyiv.\n\nZelenskyy said the U.S. again proposed a ceasefire banning strikes on energy infrastructure. Ukraine is ready to observe such a pause if Russia commits; but he added that when Moscow previously agreed to a one-week pause suggested by the U.S., it was violated after just four days.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "Elon Musk believes that space is the answer to the AI data center energy problem. SpaceX says it is hiring \"many engineers\" to make it happen.",
    "fullText": "To the world's richest man, all things eventually end in outer space.\n\nAs countries pour billions into new Earth-bound data centers in a global race for AI dominance, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk thinks the best way to conserve energy, money, and space is to put data centers in, well, space.\n\n\"In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale,\" Musk wrote in a memo announcing that SpaceX would acquire his AI company, xAI, earlier this month.\n\nSpaceX says its goal is to launch a \"constellation of a million satellites that operate as orbital data centers,\" and it's now hiring to make it happen. Each will generate about 100 kW of compute power per ton and would add 100 gigawatts of AI compute capacity annually, the company says.\n\nLike many of Musk's ambitious ideas, some have questioned the viability of this one. Musk, typically, is undeterred. He doubled down on the plan this week on the Dwarkesh Podcast.\n\n\"You can mark my words. In 36 months, but probably closer to 30 months, the most economically compelling place to put AI will be space,\" Musk, who is famous for missing deadlines, said. \"It will then get ridiculously better to be in space.\"\n\nDwarkesh Patel, the host of the eponymous long-form tech podcast (he interviewed Musk for nearly three hours), challenged the SpaceX CEO on his plan to build data centers in space.\n\nPatel said energy use is only about 10% to 15% of the total cost of operating a data center, so while planting data centers in space would solve the cost-of-energy problem, the cost of maintenance and servicing them would presumably erase any savings.\n\nMusk said the plan was not about saving money on energy consumption, but about ensuring energy availability.\n\n\"If you look at electrical output outside of China, everywhere outside of China, it's more or less flat,\" Musk replied. \"If you're putting data centers anywhere except China, where are you going to get your electricity?\"\n\nData centers are resource-intensive.\n\nThe largest can consume as much power as a city and up to several million gallons of water a day. Collectively, Business Insider estimated in an investigation published last year, that US data centers could soon consume more electricity than Poland, with a population of 36.6 million, used in 2023.\n\nBusiness Insider's investigation found that companies had filed permits to build 311 data centers nationwide as of 2010. By the end of 2024, that number had nearly quadrupled to 1,240.\n\nAs of 2023, about 4.4% of total US electricity consumption came from data centers, according to the Department of Energy. Globally, data centers accounted for about 1.5% of global electricity consumption in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nMcKinsey and Company estimates that by 2030, data centers will require $6.7 trillion in investment worldwide to keep pace with demand for computing power.\n\nThe need for data centers is driving enormous spending among the big AI companies. Capital expenditures for Big Tech are expected to reach some $600 billion in 2026, with Amazon alone planning to spend $200 billion.\n\nSpaceX has already started hiring for its space-based data center project.\n\nMichael Nicolls, the vice president of Starlink Engineering, wrote in a post on X on Friday that the company is hiring for \"many critical engineering roles\" to develop space-bound data centers. One of them is for a \"Space Lasers Engineer\" based out of Redmond, Washington.\n\nLocating data centers in space might appeal to the communities, like Northern Virginia, where electricity costs are growing and housing developments are vying with data centers for land.\n\nFor Musk, the idea is simple. \"I mean, space is called 'space' for a reason,\" he wrote in SpaceX's memo.\n\nSpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "If you're low on energy all the time, have you tried spending eight hours in a cool, dark, quiet room?",
    "fullText": "It's amazing how many problems can be solved with a little sleep hygiene. If you often feel low on energy, one of the first things you should ask yourself is how much sleep you're getting. Good sleep also helps our overall health, our recovery from exercise, our ability to focus, and more. And while there are plenty of gadgets and biohacks that claim to help, the fundamentals of sleep hygiene are basic and simple.\n\nMost adults need seven to nine hours of sleep, on average, each night. This varies: you might be a seven-hour person or a nine-hour person. (Young people usually need even more; older adults may be okay with less.) So if you’re feeling tired all the time, an easy gut check is to note how much time you spend in bed, on average. If it's fewer than seven hours, it's probably not enough. And even if it's within that seven- to nine-hour window, try getting an extra hour or two of sleep for a few days in a row. If you feel a lot better, you have your answer.\n\nWearables like smartwatches and rings can help collect data, but remember that the main thing they can tell you is how much sleep you're getting. (Sleep \"quality\" scores and even sleep stages are not necessarily reliable.) To call out a few of my favorites: the Oura ring is pricey ($349-$499) but comfortable to wear and presents data nicely. The Amazfit Helio Strap is a bargain at $99 and can track workouts, too. Garmin's Index Sleep Band ($169) is built for comfort while you sleep, but gives the same data as Garmin watches, so you may just want to find a watch you like and stick with that.\n\nIf you have trouble waking up on time but easily fall asleep when you’re sitting quietly (like watching a movie), that's another sign you're probably not getting enough sleep. If you sleep in when you get the chance, your wake-up time is another hint. If you sleep in two hours or more past your normal time, that's your body applying a short-term fix (getting enough sleep now) to a long-term problem (chronically getting too little sleep).\n\nIf you know you should sleep more, but you can’t seem to figure out how, below are the basics of sleep hygiene you need to master.\n\nSet a wake-up time that you can stick to every day. Consistency is important here: don’t set the alarm for 6 a.m. on weekdays and sleep until noon on weekends. If you can’t be perfectly consistent—for example, if you work different shifts—adjust as needed, but try to do your best.\n\nNext comes setting a bedtime. Figure out what time you need to hit the hay to get enough sleep before your alarm goes off. Then work backward from that to figure out when to start changing into jammies and whatever else your nighttime routine involves. (More on that routine below.)\n\nCrucial to both steps is prioritizing sleep so you can actually get yourself on schedule. If you’ve been having trouble getting enough sleep lately, give yourself a week or two to make your bedtime and wake-up time (and nine or so hours in between) the highest priority appointments in your calendar. Don’t go out too late, and don’t stay up revenge procrastinating. There will be time for occasional indulgences once your everyday schedule is more consistent.\n\nOkay, so what goes into that routine? Feel free to personalize the specifics, but sleep experts recommend that you include the following as basic building blocks:\n\nAt least 30 minutes dedicated to winding down. Don’t expect to switch off the lights and instantly be able to zonk out.\n\nNo screens right before bedtime. No, not even with blue-blocking glasses. Those glasses don’t actually block very much blue light anyway. Videos and social media keep your brain awake and unrelaxed, so they don’t really have a place in your wind-down time anyway.\n\nDim the lights. A cool, dark bedroom makes it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep.\n\nDo something relaxing. Read a chill book. Take a luxurious bath. Do some breathing exercises. Whatever works for you.\n\nSticking to this routine not only helps you get into a relaxed mood for sleeping, it also helps you stick to that sleep schedule you set in the first step. After all, you can't be halfway through a movie at 10 p.m. if you refrained from starting it at 9 p.m.\n\nSleep and darkness aren't the only things that set your body's circadian rhythms. Daytime activities help to keep your internal clock on track, and these can help your overall health as well.\n\nGet plenty of sunlight in the morning. (In the winter, a light box may help.)\n\nExercise during the day. You can combine this with sunlight by going for a morning or lunchtime walk. But any type of exercise will help you to sleep better.\n\nEat meals earlier in the day. We sleep best when we eat during the daytime; if a nice early breakfast fits your schedule, consider making it a regular thing. But at the very least, don’t eat right before bed.\n\nCaffeine keeps you up, and its effects linger longer than you may realize. Caffeine has a half-life of five hours, with some of us processing it a little faster or a little slower. To put this another way, If the average person has a 250-milligram cup of coffee at noon (such as a Starbucks Tall sized brewed coffee), they'll still have about 125 milligrams in their system at 5 p.m. and 63 milligrams at 10 p.m.\n\nThe speed with which we break down caffeine varies from person to person, but in general: It’s affecting you more than you realize. If you think of yourself as a person who “can have an energy drink and then fall right to sleep” you are probably (a) in denial—hey, you’re the one who clicked on an article about getting better sleep—and/or (b) you have built up a massive caffeine tolerance because you drink so much of the stuff to stay awake, which in turn is because you don’t get enough sleep so you’re tired all the time. Do yourself a favor and break the cycle. An easy way to back off is to give yourself a cutoff time. No caffeine after 5 p.m., let’s say. Once that’s part of your routine, walk it back to 2 p.m. or noon.\n\nAlcohol is another chemical that affects our sleep. A nightcap before bed may make you feel sleepy, but it tends to disrupt the quality of your sleep. If you aren’t convinced, just start keeping a sleep diary—on paper is fine if you don’t have a sleep-tracking gadget—and see if you don’t get more and better sleep on the nights you don’t drink.\n\nA welcoming, cozy bed will help you get to sleep faster. Make it dark, with blackout curtains or an eye mask, if needed. Make it quiet, with a white noise machine or earplugs if you can’t completely silence your surroundings. And make it a comfortable temperature. Most people prefer a cool environment—usually around 66 degrees—but again, this varies from person to person.\n\nComfortable sheets and pillows can help. If you’re always tossing and turning, try to figure out if there’s something that physically bothers you. A new mattress might not be in the budget, but a mattress topper or a different pillow is an easy fix.\n\nWhile the tips here are the basic things you should at least try, you may not need every single aspect to be textbook. I freeze if my room is set to 66 degrees, for example, so I keep the thermostat a tick warmer and I make sure I always have a warm duvet, even in summertime.\n\nYou may find that you can bend certain rules but not others. I always have a crappy night’s sleep if I’ve been drinking, but late meals don’t bother me much. Once you’re getting a solid night’s sleep on the regular, you can start playing with the routine.\n\nAnd if you’re doing everything you can for good sleep hygiene and you still feel tired all the time, consider seeking medical help in case you have sleep apnea or another condition that could be affecting your sleep or energy levels.",

    "fullText": "Russia said the United States is pushing Russian companies out of Venezuela's energy sector.\n\n\"Right now, following Venezuela and what is happening there, our companies are quite openly being pushed out of Venezuela,\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview with RT, a state-linked media network.\n\nThe US launched a military operation in early January that resulted in the capture of then-Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nIn the interview published on Thursday, Lavrov linked the US's pressure on Russian companies to broader efforts to curb Moscow's role in global oil markets.\n\nLavrov cited recent sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil, as well as tariffs and restrictions on countries purchasing Russian oil, including India.\n\n\"Everywhere it is being said that Russian oil and Russian gas will be replaced by American oil and American liquefied natural gas,\" Lavrov said.\n\nRussia now faces the prospect of significant financial losses in Venezuela following the US operation, which has upended decades of strategic cooperation between Moscow and Caracas spanning energy, defense, and diplomacy.\n\nEnergy ties played a central role, reflecting the importance of the oil sector to Russia's economy.\n\nA former US ambassador-at-large for the former Soviet Union warned last month that Russia's exposure in Venezuela could translate into concrete losses.\n\n\"Russian investments in Venezuela's oil industry over the last twenty years will now have to be, formally or informally, written off,\" wrote Stephen Sestanovich, the George F. Kennan senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nLoans for Venezuela's purchase of Russian weapons could meet the same fate, while trade between the two countries could also come to a halt, Sestanovich added.\n\nThat would come at a sensitive moment for Russia's economy.\n\nAs the war in Ukraine approaches its fifth year, sweeping Western sanctions and lower oil prices are weighing on budget revenues that fund President Vladimir Putin's war chest. In January, Russia's oil revenue plunged to its lowest level in over five years.\n\nAt least one Russian state-owned oil company has moved to ringfence its exposure. Last month, Roszarubezhneft said that all of its Venezuelan assets are owned by the Russian state.",

    "fullText": "A routine fuel stop turned into a national political flashpoint after a gas station employee refused service to federal immigration agents, igniting a debate that now reaches far beyond politics and squarely into the automotive and fuel retail space.\n\nThe incident unfolded at a Speedway gas station in Minneapolis when Border Patrol agents attempted to refuel government vehicles during official operations.\n\nAccording to video footage that quickly spread online, a man identifying himself as the store’s manager denied service and stated bluntly that he did not support ICE, adding that no one at the store did either. The agents were told to leave without being allowed to purchase fuel.\n\nWithin hours, the encounter became a lightning rod. Critics accused the business of politicizing a basic commercial service, while supporters framed the refusal as a form of protest.\n\nBut for the automotive and fuel industries, the episode raises deeper questions about neutrality, safety, and the evolving role of gas stations in an increasingly polarized environment.\n\nFuel stations occupy a unique position in American infrastructure for the simple fact that they aren’t simply retail outlets. They are essential service points relied upon by private motorists, commercial fleets, emergency responders, and, yes, government agencies like ICE.\n\nDenying fuel is not equivalent to refusing a cup of coffee or retail merchandise. Vehicles without fuel do not operate, and in the case of law enforcement or emergency services, that reality carries serious implications.\n\nIndustry experts note that while private businesses generally retain the right to refuse service, gas stations historically operate under an expectation of political neutrality. Fleet contracts, fuel cards, and government supply agreements are built on reliability, not ideology.\n\nOnce a station is perceived as selectively serving customers based on political or occupational identity, that reliability comes into question.\n\nThe fallout for Speedway and its parent companies has been swift. Calls for boycotts surfaced almost immediately, with critics warning that the brand risks alienating everyday drivers who view fuel access as nonpartisan.\n\nOthers warned of reputational damage that could ripple across franchise networks, where individual store decisions can reflect on national brands regardless of corporate policy.\n\nThere is also a safety dimension that automotive analysts are watching closely. Federal agents often refuel during active operations or long-distance deployments. Forcing vehicles to reroute in search of fuel introduces delays and unpredictability.",

    "fullText": "Global warming means the future of Winter Games “is literally melting away.”\n\nSome of the world’s greatest winter sports athletes have called on the International Olympics Committee to stop taking fossil fuel industry money, including from Italian oil giant ENI, a “Premium Partner” of the 2026 Winter Olympics. “The time has come to question the ethical implications of…normalizing the connections between our sports and the detrimental effects of the product that [fossil fuel companies] sell,” reads a petition delivered yesterday to IOC officials in Milan, Italy, where the Games’ opening ceremony takes place on Friday.\n\nBurning oil, gas, coal, and other fossil fuels is the main driver of global warming, which is raising winter temperatures and reducing the snow cover that skiing and other winter sports require. Winters are rapidly warming across much of the Northern Hemisphere, threatening not only the Olympics but also communities economically and culturally dependent on skiing and other winter recreational activities.\n\nTo date, the petition to the IOC and the International Ski and Snowboard Federation has attracted more than 20,000 signatories, including Alex Hall of the US, who won the Olympic gold medal in freestyle skiing at the 2022 Winter Games; Helvig Wessel of Norway, the 2024 Freeride World Tour skiing champion; and Nikolai Schirmer, also of Norway, whose nonprofit Ski Fossil Free organized the petition and hand-delivered it to IOC officials on February 4; a full list of signatories is available here.\n\nAlthough neither the IOC nor ENI have yet commented on the petition, the IOC did purchase 2.4 million cubic meters of artificial snow to enable reliable conditions for events taking place in the Italian Alps town of Cortina d’Ampezzo. ENI, which has said it aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, announced in December that “90% of the fuels that Eni…will supply to power the Games will be derived from renewable feedstocks.”\n\nFebruary temperatures have warmed by 3.6 degrees Celsius (6.4 degrees Fahrenheit) over the 70 years since Cortina hosted the first Winter Olympics in 1956, according to new research from the scientific nonprofit Climate Central. Cortina now experiences 41 fewer freezing days per year than it did in 1956. Globally, only half of the locations deemed suitable for future Winter Olympics will have reliably cold temperatures by the year 2050, Climate Central found. “Unless we address human-caused climate change and the fossil fuel burning that we’re doing, the possibility of having Winter Olympics is literally melting away,” Kaitlyn Trudeau, a Climate Central scientist who conducted the research, said at a press briefing on January 28 cohosted by Climate Central and Covering Climate Now.\n\n“People in my community aren’t discussing whether or not climate change is real.… it’s very, very apparent when we look at the high mountains,” said Graham Zimmerman, a professional alpinist and director of athletic alliance for the nonprofit Protect Our Winters, which supported the petition drive. Zimmerman and a team were 7,000 meters (23,000 feet) up Pakistan’s K-2, the second-highest peak in the world, when melting snow and ice forced them to shelter in place on a narrow ledge for 14 hours. “It’s an altitude where, generally speaking, you are putting on all of the puffy clothes to stay warm,” he said. “Instead, we found ourselves in temperatures of 42 degrees [F] in the shade, having to take shelter from avalanches and rock fall because the mountain was literally falling apart.”\n\nAlthough amateur climbers, skiers, and snowboarders are not immune to such dangers, the greater risk for them is simply fewer opportunities to enjoy their favorite winter sports. “Climate Central data shows a steady decline in snowfall at nearly two-thirds of monitoring stations” in the United States, Ben Tracy, a climate journalist on assignment for Climate Central, said in a TV report shown during the briefing (and available for TV stations to air free of charge). “For the ski industry, that meltdown means billions in lost revenue.” A resort Tracy visited in Idaho that normally would have 42 ski runs open had only one—and that one was open only because of costly artificial snow.\n\nThat winters are rapidly warming even as bitter cold grips much of the US at the moment may seem counterintuitive to some people (including the nation’s climate-denier in chief), but scientists explain that weather is not the same thing as climate. “In a warming world we’re still going to have cold snaps, they’ll just be less frequent,” Trudeau said. A good way to think about it, she added, is that “weather is [the clothes] you’re wearing today. Climate is the clothes you have in your closet.”\n\nThe unreliability of winters on a warming planet leads Rocky Anderson, the former mayor of Salt Lake City, Utah, to emphasize the urgency of phasing out fossil fuels. Anderson was the mayor when Salt Lake City hosted the 2002 Games, a role it is scheduled to repeat in 2034. But during his interview with Tracy, he pointed to the majestic peaks east of the city and noted, “There’s almost no snow anywhere in those mountains,” adding, “I don’t think we’re going to see a Winter Olympic Games in Utah in 2034.”\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nJupiter is slightly smaller and flatter than scientists thought for decades, a new study finds.\n\nResearchers used radio data from the Juno spacecraft to refine measurements of the solar system's largest planet. Although the differences between the current and previous measurements are small, they are improving models of Jupiter's interior and of other gas giants like it outside the solar system, the team reported Feb. 2 in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n\n\"Textbooks will need to be updated,\" study co-author Yohai Kaspi, a planetary scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, said in a statement. \"The size of Jupiter hasn't changed, of course, but the way we measure it has.\"\n\nUntil now, scientists' understanding of Jupiter's size and shape have been based on six measurements performed by the Voyager 1 and 2 and Pioneer 10 and 11 missions. Those measurements, which have since been adopted as standard, were performed around 50 years ago using radio beams, according to the statement.\n\nBut the Juno mission, which has been gathering data on Jupiter and its moons since it arrived at the gas giant in 2016, has collected much more of this radio data in the past two years. With that additional data, researchers have now refined measurements of Jupiter's size down to about 1,300 feet (400 meters) in each direction.\n\n\"Just by knowing the distance to Jupiter and watching how it rotates, it's possible to figure out its size and shape,\" Kaspi said. \"But making really accurate measurements calls for more sophisticated methods.\"\n\nIn the new study, the scientists tracked how the radio signals from Juno back to Earth bent as they passed through Jupiter's atmosphere, before cutting out when the planet blocked the signal entirely. Those measurements allowed the team to account for Jupiter's winds, which slightly alter the shape of the gaseous planet. Then, they used that information to make precise calculations of the planet's shape and size.\n\nWith the new data, the team calculated that the planet's radius from its pole to its center is 41,534 miles (66,842 km) — 7.5 miles (12 km) smaller than previous measurements. The newly calculated radius at the equator is 44,421 miles (71,488 km) — 2.5 miles (4 km) smaller than previously thought.\n\n\"These few kilometers matter,\" study co-author Eli Galanti, an expert on gas giants at the Weizmann Institute of Science, said in the statement. \"Shifting the radius by just a little lets our models of Jupiter's interior fit both the gravity data and atmospheric measurements much better.\"\n\n—Jupiter is shrinking and used to be twice as big, mind-boggling study reveals\n\n—Spiders on Jupiter? Scientists uncover secret origins of arachnid-like 'demon' lurking on gas giant's moon\n\n—Is Jupiter's Great Red Spot an impostor? Giant storm may not be the original one discovered 350 years ago\n\nThe updated measurements will improve our understanding of Jupiter's interior, as well as help scientists interpret data from gas giants beyond the solar system, the researchers wrote in the study.\n\n\"This research helps us understand how planets form and evolve,\" Kaspi said in the statement. \"Jupiter was likely the first planet to form in the solar system, and by studying what's happening inside it, we get closer to understanding how the solar system, and planets like ours, came to be.\"",

    "description": "Russian missiles and drones have pounded Ukraine’s energy grid in recent weeks, plunging people into frozen darkness in one of the country’s coldest winters on record.  Ukraine has accused Russia of illegally targeting power infrastructure during the war to deny civilians light, heating and running water.  \"Taking advantage of the coldest days of winter to terrorize people is more important to Russia than diplomacy,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday, on the eve of a new round of talks about ending the conflict and as temperatures in Kyiv hovered around minus 20 C (minus 3 F).",
    "fullText": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Russian missiles and drones have pounded Ukraine’s energy grid in recent weeks, plunging people into frozen darkness in one of the country’s coldest winters on record.\n\nUkraine has accused Russia of illegally targeting power infrastructure during the war to deny civilians light, heating and running water.\n\n\"Taking advantage of the coldest days of winter to terrorize people is more important to Russia than diplomacy,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday, on the eve of a new round of talks about ending the conflict and as temperatures in Kyiv hovered around minus 20 C (minus 3 F).\n\nRussia says its attacks are a legitimate part of its military campaign against its neighbor. Moscow's invasion of Ukraine itself is widely regarded as an illegal act of aggression.\n\nSo, are attacks on energy installations allowed during war?\n\nCombatants can legally target a power grid if the attack “directly affects a valid military target” — but they cannot cause excessive civilian casualties, said David Crane, former chief prosecutor at the United Nations Special Court for Sierra Leone.\n\nIn the case of Russia's attacks on Ukraine, “the indiscriminate and widespread targeting does not come close to what is legal,” he said in an emailed response to questions from The Associated Press.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross says that parts of energy systems providing essential services to civilians “are in principle civilian objects, and as such are protected against direct attack and reprisals as well as incidental harm.”\n\nPretrial judges from the International Criminal Court, in fact, issued arrest warrants in 2024 for top Russian military brass and the country’s former defense minister for their alleged involvement in missile strikes targeting electricity infrastructure.\n\nIn announcing warrants for former Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Russia’s chief military officer, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the court said that judges found “reasonable grounds to believe that the alleged strikes were directed against civilian objects, and for those installations that may have qualified as military objectives at the relevant time, the expected incidental civilian harm and damage would have been clearly excessive to the anticipated military advantage.”\n\nRussia is not a member of the court, rejects its jurisdiction, and refuses to extradite suspects to face justice in the ICC’s courtrooms in The Hague, Netherlands.\n\nThe Russian military has repeatedly said that it has targeted energy facilities and other infrastructure that support Ukrainian military industries and armed forces. It has denied targeting residential areas despite daily evidence to the contrary.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted Wednesday that “our military is striking the targets that they believe are associated with the military complex of the Kyiv regime, the operation is continuing.”\n\nKyiv accuses Russia of seeking to wear down Ukrainians’ appetite for the fight by inflicting grinding hardship on civilians forced to live in dark, freezing homes.\n\nAuthorities say Russia has tried to cripple Ukraine's electricity network by targeting substations, transformers, turbines and generators at power plants. Ukraine’s largest private power company, DTEK, said that this week's overnight attack was the ninth major assault on the company’s thermal power plants since October.\n\nUkraine’s energy sector has suffered more than $20 billion in direct war damage, according to a joint estimate by the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations.",

This collision caused the bottom of the Earth’s crust to melt, with the molten material rising higher in the crust and forming granite. “There are lots of different types of granite that intrude at different times, more than 10m years or so,” she says. “The rock is made of minerals and, if you’ve got the right composition in the original material and the right conditions, then within those minerals there are some called mica. Some of those micas contain lithium.”\n\nThat’s what we are talking about here: lithium, the L-word. Or possibly the El Dorado word; lithium is often referred to as “white gold”, and in 2021 the then PM Boris Johnson declared that Cornwall would be the “Klondike of lithium”.\n\nIt is not breaking news that there is lithium here. Victorian miners reported finding it in the water coming from the ground. (You may know, possibly from Poldark, about Cornwall’s rich history mining tin and copper; it has been going on since the early bronze age, in about 2000BC.) Back then there was little use for lithium. Now it is a very different story. Its high electrochemical potential means lithium can hold a charge for longer than most other elements and so is ideal for use in rechargeable batteries. That’s phones, laptops and so much of the technology we use. Plus, electric cars and big battery storage projects. Lithium is now among the most important mined elements on the planet.\n\nMost of the world’s lithium is extracted in Australia and the lithium triangle in South America (Chile, Argentina and Bolivia), as well as in China, which also processes and therefore controls a majority of it for use in batteries. Cornwall doesn’t compare in scale, but it is, says Wall, “probably the largest lithium deposit in Europe”. A couple of companies – British Lithium and Cornish Lithium – are leading the way to tap into it.\n\nJeremy Wrathall is the founder of the latter. When he graduated from Camborne School of Mines in 1988, mining in Cornwall was gasping its last breaths – with just four active mines left, down from more than 300 in the 1860s. Now there are none, though there are still some china clay (kaolin) operations. So Wrathall went to work in South African goldmines, before returning to London to work as a mining analyst and financier.\n\nCornwall remained in his heart, though, and when electric cars began to be a thing, he remembered hearing about the lithium there. “I put lithium plus Cornwall into Google and up came four historical records of lithium being found in water. I thought: that one is an awful long way away from that one, they must be geologically connected. And then I thought: maybe I’m on to something and should start picking up mineral rights. So that’s what I did.”\n\nAlong with the mineral rights for which he did deals, Wrathall acquired a number of 19th-century mining plans, which gave him information about geological features – the granite and what was in it. He founded Cornish Lithium in 2016.\n\nWrathall says the UK – particularly Cornwall – will be able to extract 50,000 tonnes of lithium (actually lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate equivalent, depending on how it’s extracted) a year for more than 20 years – about 50% of the UK’s annual needs by 2030. There are two methods. One is to extract lithium from water via deep boreholes, which we will get to later. Here at Trelavour is the company’s “hard rock extraction” site. Wrathall picks up a small piece of rock. “You can see the sparkly bits, that’s the mica – all of this rock, everything you can see, has lithium.”\n\nHe explains that there will be some blasting, then the granite will be dug from the quarry and crushed before going on a conveyor belt to the processing plant in the valley. But, hang on; this doesn’t sound super sustainable, even if the intended destination is the UK’s transition to clean renewable energy. Lithium mining projects in Portugal and Serbia have been hampered by fierce opposition from locals and environmentalists. In Argentina, mining companies and politicians have been accused of robbing Indigenous people of their water and employing colonial-style divide-and-rule tactics in pursuit of the valuable metal. Why is that not happening here?\n\nWall explains that it is a very different process in South America, where brine gets pumped into a series of ponds and then evaporates slowly in the sun. Cornwall has neither the geology nor climate for that. Trelavour is a traditional quarry, “so you’ve got all your normal stuff associated with quarrying: drilling, blasting and lorries.” Environmental permits are very strict, she says, and they’ll need to sort out what they’re doing with the waste. “But the granite is pretty benign, it’s not like some of the sulphides, where you have a lot of trouble with acid mine drainage [the outflow of acidic water largely from metal and coal mines].”\n\nSome of the byproducts could be valuable: silica for cement, sulphate of potash for fertiliser, gypsum for plasterboard. Wrathall says the company’s crushers are electric and it will look into using electric trucks. “We’re trying our best to go zero carbon, or very low carbon.” The situation in Cornwall is different from the controversial projects in Europe, he says, because the quarry already exists; they will simply be repurposing it. “You can see the damage is done. In Portugal, it is a pristine area, olive groves, it would be digging up people’s farms. This is not a farm. What are you going to do with this? It’s dangerous, fenced-off to stop people getting in. And at the end of it, we will rehabilitate it.”\n\nI have found it hard to find anyone who is really against the project. Charmian Larke of the Cornwall Climate Action Network says: “Because the area is so destroyed anyway, the surrounding villages tend to be very poor, with poor health and educational outcomes.” Wrathall says the Cornish people are proud of their 4,000-year history of mining, “and it will bring back economic prosperity to an area with one of the highest levels of deprivation in the country”.\n\nOn cue, we are joined by Peter Morse, general manager of the hard-rock project here. He grew up in the nearby village of Roche. His family has been here for generations, he says, mostly working in the china clay industry, and he used to ride around in a truck with his grandad, driving in and out of the plants. He thought he would go into it, too, and did a geology degree. Instead, he went to the US, where he worked in the mining industry for 30 years.\n\nWrathall and Morse are what are known as “Cousin Jacks” – Cornish miners who went abroad to work. “If you go anywhere in the world and there’s a hole, there’ll be a Cousin Jack at the bottom of it,” says Morse. They took a bit of Cornwall with them: he says he could get a pasty on the shores of Lake Superior.\n\nWhen he came back home, it was different from when he left: fewer people were employed in the china clay business. St Dennis, the village nearest to the site, used to have three pubs and a bunch of shops. Now there is just one of each. “And St Austell is not the town it was when I went to school there. It was bustling, lively – but it doesn’t feel like that now.”\n\nMorse says lithium can help to reverse the trend. Cousin Jack is back. I also spoke to Noah Law, another local, now Labour MP for St Austell and Newquay. “Mining is part of our heritage, it’s part of what makes Cornwall great. It has made us wealthy in the past and can do the same again.”\n\nThings have changed though. “Mining is more capital intensive than it used to be, and not as labour intensive. Part of the challenge is sharing the prosperity. I’ve levelled with the industry to say we’re really invested in this and are going to work hard to make a success of the industry, if it is willing to work really hard to make sure my constituents are sharing the spoils.”\n\nLaw says Cornwall can be a beautiful place and an industrial powerhouse, “because that’s what we have been for the most of the past 200-300 years. It’s only recently that Cornwall hasn’t been an industrial economy.”\n\nCornish Lithium employs just over 100 people, and the plan is to triple that. “Every mining job provides at least four times as many knock-on jobs,” says Wrathall. And not just another shop selling wetsuits or ice cream. “They’re good, but that’s not going to make any difference to the lives of people here. What is going to make a difference is the development of an industry that is already here, but is now seeing its next generation. It’s going to change Cornwall’s future.”\n\nWe have come down from the quarry to the processing plant, where the lithium gets extracted from the granite. At this stage it’s a demonstration facility, but it still takes up a huge shed, a remnant of a former china clay facility. The crushed granite comes in at one end and the lithium is extracted in a series of processes. First physical – milling, soaking, spinning – followed by chemical separation that involves dissolving the mica in sulphuric acid. All the machinery – mills and pipes, scrubbers and chillers, pumps and vats – looks rather Willy Wonka. And here’s a bag of the end product – lithium hydroxide, a white crystalline power that looks, frankly, illegal.\n\nAbout 20 miles away, the villages of St Day and Gwennap were once big centres for tin and copper mining and the surrounding landscape is dotted with derelict brick engine houses from that time. Between the two is now the centre for Cornish Lithium’s other project: geothermal extraction. It doesn’t look much, a capped borehole in the corner of the United Downs industrial estate, but under the cap a shaft goes down 800 metres. This was the first exploratory hole. They’ve since done others, including one 2km deep on a farm a few miles away at Cross Lanes. The results were very positive and Cross Lanes has recently been granted planning permission for the country’s first commercial geothermal lithium production facility.\n\nIn another shed, Adam Matthews, who leads the geology team, shows me what it’s all about. Laid out on trays are hundreds of core samples of rock from the Cross Lanes drill holes: they look like pencil leads for giants. One is solid, “siltstone and sandstones mostly, the darker bands are muds, nothing of much interest”, says Matthews. But here’s one from 1,700 metres down, “and you can see fractures running throughout the rock. The water flows naturally throughout those fractures.”\n\nIn this water – hot brine – they have found lithium. The next stage is to drill two new larger diameter 2km-deep holes, one to pump the water out, the other to return it once the lithium has been extracted. It’s probably the least impactful, most sustainable way of getting hold of lithium.\n\nThe water at that depth is between 80 and 90C and Wrathall says it could be used to provide low-carbon heat energy for communities and industries. There are few houses to heat near to Cross Lanes, but he says the heat could be used in agriculture. “There is an opportunity to build greenhouses there, to grow tomatoes and cucumbers.”\n\nIt sounds wonderful – pumping water out of the ground, extracting the mineral that will help the country on its transition to renewable energy, then returning the water to where it came from … with a byproduct of locally grown salad.\n\nBut we’re not quite there yet. The next phase will be to build a demonstration plant to produce samples of lithium. If successful, the company will build a commercial production plant there. The Trelavour hard rock site is also still at the demonstration phase. Wrathall thinks they will first be producing lithium commercially in 2028 or 29. Even then the UK will still have to import about half of what it needs. Reliance on China isn’t over yet.\n\nSince they’ve been looking at lithium in Cornwall, “we’ve seen critical minerals go from ‘Who cares?’ to ‘Oh my goodness, what are we going to do?’” says Wrathall. “Why is Trump interested in Greenland? Minerals. Ukraine? Minerals. Canada? Minerals? I’m just hoping he doesn’t find out about Cornwall!”",

    "fullText": "HOUSTON/NEW YORK, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Oil refiners on the U.S. Gulf Coast are struggling to absorb a rapid surge in Venezuelan crude shipments since last month's flagship $2 billion supply deal between Caracas and Washington, pressuring prices and leaving some volumes unsold, according to traders and shipping data.\n\nWhat challenges are U.S. refiners facing with Venezuelan crude?\n\nHow might India's trade deal affect Venezuelan oil sales?\n\nWhat role do trading houses play in Venezuelan exports?\n\nHow has Venezuelan oil export volume changed recently?\n\nThe soft U.S. demand represents ​an early obstacle for President Donald Trump's hopes of sending the majority of the South American country's oil to the United States since U.S. forces captured Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro ‌last month in a raid in Caracas.\n\nTrading houses Vitol and Trafigura were granted U.S. licenses to market and sell millions of barrels of Venezuelan oil following the U.S. operation and a subsequent supply agreement with interim President Delcy Rodriguez.\n\nThe trading houses, ‌which joined energy major Chevron in holding approval to export Venezuelan oil, struck several early deals to sell some cargoes to refiners in the U.S. and Europe. However, with Chevron also raising exports quickly, the trading companies are now finding it harder to secure enough buyers among Gulf Coast refiners, traders said.\n\n\"We're all facing this issue where there's more to place and not enough takers,\" one of the traders said, citing reluctance from U.S. refiners to buy Venezuelan crude. Some refiners are complaining that prices, albeit declining, remain high compared to competing Canadian heavy grades.\n\nVenezuelan heavy oil cargoes for delivery at the Gulf Coast are being offered at ⁠about $9.50 per barrel below benchmark Brent, versus discounts of between $6 and $7.50 per ‌barrel in mid-January.\n\nLast month, total Venezuelan oil exports to the U.S. almost tripled to 284,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to data based on tanker movements.\n\nThe U.S. was absorbing some 500,000 bpd of Venezuelan oil before Washington imposed sanctions on the country in 2019. But exports to the U.S. went to zero in mid-2025 ‍after Trump revoked all licenses to trade and ship.\n\nReaching the U.S. refiners' maximum capacity again will require time, one of the traders said, in part because some facilities would require adjustments to process heavier oil.\n\nThe chief executive of refiner Phillips 66, Mark Lashier, said on Tuesday the company can process around 250,000 bpd of Venezuelan crude, but prices must be competitive for Venezuelan grades to displace other sources of heavy oil.\n\nChevron and Trafigura declined to comment. ​Venezuela's state oil firm PDVSA and Vitol did not reply to requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "LOS ARRECIFES, Mexico (AP) — The sun has set and the clouds are washed in purple as Mauricio Contreras and his daughter Eunices head out to fish in the Gulf of Mexico. Eunices casts the heavy net for snapper, pollock or cabrilla while her father pilots their small boat.\n\nContreras, an anchor dangling from a silver chain against his deeply tanned skin, has been doing this for more than 40 years. But he worries the family's main source of income is now at risk from an underwater pipeline completed last year to import natural gas from the United States.\n\n“When they started laying it, it affected us because the boats were dropping explosives and you could hear it all the way here, right on the shore,” Contreras recalls. Now that it's operational, he worries about leaks: “It’s a constant danger that will always be there, and it’s a risk for the entire fishing industry.”\n\nThe pipeline known as Southeast Gateway was built by Canadian company TC Energy in partnership with Mexico’s state-owned power company CFE. It adds 700 kilometers (435 miles) to a line that now stretches from southern Texas to Tabasco state, where it's supplying electricity for a major oil refinery. But its main goal is to someday deliver gas to the Yucatan Peninsula when the expansion of another pipeline is completed.\n\nSoutheast Gateway is part of a wave of projects that would allow Mexico, already the world's single largest buyer of U.S. gas, to bring in even more for its own use and to re-export to Asia and Europe. But that faces growing resistance from communities and environmental groups who say the strategy increases use of a polluting fossil fuel, deepens dependence on the U.S. and puts Mexico's climate commitments at risk.\n\nMore than 40,000 people across Veracruz make their living from the sea, including Contreras, who lives in a community where fishing is almost the only work. He joined residents of 15 coastal communities last year in a lawsuit over the pipeline that was dismissed, but is under appeal.\n\nThey allege that their communities, mostly Nahua and Nuntajiiyi' Indigenous peoples, weren't consulted before construction began as required by Mexico's Constitution.\n\n“We do not agree with this gas pipeline megaproject because we were never informed about it. We were never consulted and therefore we do not know the consequences it will have,” Maribel Cervantes, an activist and teacher who joined the lawsuit, said.\n\nThe government argued that Southeast Gateway was a matter of national security and kept some information about it secret, including its exact route. President Claudia Sheinbaum said last year that it was important for natural gas to reach the area.\n\nGreenpeace warned that dredging to bury the pipeline could affect deepwater reefs that are home to many species, some not found in shallow reefs. Pablo Ramírez, Greenpeace Mexico's energy and climate change program coordinator, also said methane leaks could affect ecosystems like the reefs. They sustain important species, including green and olive ridley sea turtles that nest on the beaches of communities such as Los Arrecifes.\n\nIn a video last September, TC Energy said experts had “thoroughly analyzed the marine environment to ensure that the route was designed to preserve ecosystems.” The Canadian company declined an interview but said the pipeline created 4,000 jobs during construction and met all federal requirements. It said the project “brings natural gas to the southeast of Mexico for the first time, opening opportunities for economic and social development in one of the poorest regions of the country.”\n\nMexico's push for U.S. gas dates to a 2013 reform that opened its energy sector to private and foreign investment, said Víctor Ramírez of energy consulting firm P21Energía. The goal was to reduce the use of more polluting fuels, such as fuel oil and coal, and take advantage of low natural gas prices in the U.S.\n\nNow, as the U.S. seeks new markets for gas fracked from the Permian Basin in Texas, Mexico offers not only a strategic geographic position for re-export but also more favorable political conditions for reaching markets the U.S. cannot easily access, said Wilmar Suárez, an energy analyst at Ember.\n\nIn turn, Mexico can resell that gas to other countries at a profit, Suárez said.\n\nSoutheast Gateway is currently supplying gas only to the $20 billion Dos Bocas refinery, one of former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's flagship projects and Mexico's largest refinery. But it could eventually carry more than 1.3 billion cubic feet of gas per day if the government's ambitious plans are realized.\n\nThose include completing another pipeline to connect Southeast Gateway with a planned plant in Oaxaca that will convert the gas to liquid for shipment to Asia. These plants burn part of the gas to power liquefaction, generating polluting emissions, said Claudia Campero of the Mexican nonprofit Climate Connections.\n\nLiquefaction plants have drawn the most opposition in recent years. That includes the Saguaro project, a planned 800-kilometer (500-mile) gas pipeline from Texas to the fishing community of Puerto Libertad, in Sonora. There, the U.S. company Mexico Pacific wants to build a plant to liquefy 15 million tons of gas per year for shipment to Asia.\n\nSuch shipping would pass through the Gulf of California, threatening whales because it's a key area for reproduction, Campero said.\n\nThe project is on hold due to lawsuits.\n\nMexico’s first export terminal for liquefied natural gas began operating in 2024, but many more are planned. If all of those come online, Mexico would have eight, with most along the Pacific coastline, according to Global Energy Monitor. The U.S. currently has nine.\n\nBoth Víctor Ramírez and Suárez said Mexico's natural gas strategy now jeopardizes its energy sovereignty.\n\nMore than 60% of Mexico’s electricity comes from gas-fired power plants, and about 70% of that gas comes from the U.S. Fitch Ratings said last year that Mexico's reliance on U.S.-piped gas will continue to grow because of rising demand, insufficient domestic production and the buildout of pipelines.\n\n“It is very easy for the U.S. to impose certain conditions on Mexico because it has a dominant position over gas supplies,\" Suárez said.\n\nThe Ministry of Energy did not respond to interview requests.\n\nPablo Ramírez, of Greenpeace, said completing all the pipeline projects would make it unlikely Mexico could meet its goal of reducing net carbon dioxide emissions by 31% to 37% by 2035. And Suárez, of Ember, said the strong focus on gas raises doubt about Mexico more than doubling — to 45% — its electricity from renewables by 2030, as promised by Sheinbaum.\n\nSheinbaum inherited most of the gas projects and must honor those commitments because funds have been invested, said Víctor Ramírez, of P21Energia. But he found optimism in the Ministry of Energy approving 20 private renewable energy projects in December.\n\nBack in Maribel Cervantes' courtyard in San Juan Volador, far from where Mexico City's powerful make energy policy decisions, she demanded that officials take communities like hers into account.\n\n“As Indigenous peoples, we demand that our right to autonomy and self-determination be respected,\" she said. \"We don't want them imposing their megaprojects on us.”\n\nDe Miguel reported from Mexico City.

    "fullText": "KYIV, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Russia has largely observed a ceasefire on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday as Kyiv prepared for the next round of trilateral talks on how ​to end the war.\n\nZelenskiy said that Russia had not carried out any targeted missile or drone strikes ‌on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in the past 24 hours, but steady Russian shelling hit energy facilities near the front line.\n\n\"The de-escalation measures... are ‌helping to build public trust in the negotiation process and its possible outcome. The war needs to be ended,\" Zelenskiy said after he met his negotiating team ahead of the next round of peace talks with Russian and U.S. officials scheduled to take place this week in Abu Dhabi. \"Ukraine is ready for real steps. We believe it is realistic to achieve a ⁠dignified and lasting peace.\"\n\nIn his nightly ‌video address, Zelenskiy noted that Russian forces had continued to shell Ukrainian positions and logistics, damaging transmission lines and other sites in parts of the southeastern Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions.\n\nHe ‍said the pause in strikes on energy infrastructure underscored the fact that U.S. efforts to pursue negotiations to end the war were having an impact.\n\n\"This demonstrates that when the United States has the motivation to genuinely change the situation, the situation can indeed ​change,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\nRussia and Ukraine said last week they halted strikes on each other's energy infrastructure, but disagreed ‌on the timeframe for the truce.\n\nThe Kremlin said U.S. President Donald Trump had made a personal request to Russian President Vladimir Putin to refrain from striking Kyiv until February 1. Zelenskiy said the truce was supposed to last for a week, starting January 30.\n\nUKRAINE STRUGGLES TO RESTORE POWER SUPPLIES\n\nUkraine is struggling to restore its battered energy system and secure electricity and heat for the population after several large Russian strikes this month. Repair work has been complicated by ⁠bitterly cold temperatures.\n\n\"Today we are coming to the critical point. We ​need some time to recover what is destroyed for the last ​three months,\" said Maxim Timchenko, CEO of private energy producer DTEK. \"Energy ceasefire is extremely important for us to recover partly and avoid any tragic consequences because of no power supply.\"\n\nDTEK said on ‍Monday one of its coal ⁠mining enterprises in the Dnipropetrovsk region had been attacked for the second time in 24 hours. The previous strike on Sunday killed 12 miners, the company said.\n\nZelenskiy also said Russian forces were focusing on ⁠attacking transport logistics, especially railway infrastructure.\n\nRegional officials said that a Russian strike had killed a father and a son, and wounded two children and ‌their mother in the frontline Donetsk region.",

Musk folded social media ​platform X into xAI through a share swap last year, giving the AI startup access to the platform’s data and distribution. In 2016, he used Tesla's stock to buy his solar-energy company SolarCity.\n\nThe ‍agreement could draw scrutiny from regulators and ⁠investors over governance, valuation and conflicts of interest given Musk's overlapping leadership roles across multiple firms, as well as the potential movement of engineers, proprietary technology and contracts between entities.",

    "fullText": "Feb 2 (Reuters) - Venezuelan oil exports rose to some 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) in January, from 498,000 bpd in December, after the U.S. capture of Nicolas Maduro and the ending of an oil ​blockade which has let traders carry most exports, shipping data showed.\n\nWashington imposed an oil embargo on the U.S.-sanctioned ‌country in December to pressure Maduro and seized seven tankers.\n\nHow did Venezuelan oil exports change in January?\n\nWhich companies received licenses to export Venezuelan oil?\n\nWhere is Venezuelan oil being shipped now?\n\nWhat caused the U.S. oil blockade to end?\n\nThe blockade led to the accumulation of more than 40 million barrels of crude and fuel ‌in onshore tanks and vessels that could not be exported and forced Venezuela's state-run energy company PDVSA to cut output in early January.\n\nSince the U.S. Treasury Department extended the first licenses to traders Trafigura and Vitol in January to begin exporting the stocks, oil production, processing and shipments from the OPEC member have accelerated, the data, which is based on tanker movements, shows.\n\nThe January volume ⁠was close to average exports of 847,000 bpd ‌of crude and fuel last year. However, PDVSA's partners and traders would have to continue accelerating the pace of exports to drain millions of barrels still in inventories, so crude output cuts ‍can be fully reversed.\n\nThe January exports were slightly lower than the 867,000 bpd shipped in the same month of 2025, the data showed.\n\nThe Treasury Department last week issued a broad license authorizing business between U.S. companies and PDVSA to export, store, transport and refine Venezuelan oil, ​another step to untangle exports. PDVSA's partners, including Chevron, are still waiting for individual licenses to expand operations.\n\nThe United States ‌last month regained its position as the main individual destination of Venezuela's crude with some 284,000 bpd exported there, of which 220,000 bpd were shipped by Chevron, up from the 99,000 bpd it sent the previous month.\n\nChina, which until December was the top destination of Venezuelan oil, with than 70% of total exports, received 156,000 bpd last month. There were no exports to political ally Cuba.\n\nVitol and Trafigura exported 12 million barrels of Venezuelan crude and fuel oil under U.S. licenses, or about ⁠392,000 bpd in January, mostly to storage terminals in the Caribbean, ​the data showed, from which they began exporting and marketing cargoes to customers ​in the U.S., Europe and India.\n\nBetween 18 million and 38 million barrels more are yet to be exported under the $2 billion flagship supply deal agreed by Caracas and Washington shortly after Maduro's capture, ‍with sale proceeds going to a ⁠U.S.-supervised fund.",

    "description": "Shirin Behzadi shares how fleeing Iran alone at 18 led her from gas station shifts to becoming the CEO of a billion-dollar company.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Shirin Behzadi, author of \"The Unexpected CEO: My Journey from Gas Station Cashier to Billion-Dollar CEO.\" It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy childhood in Iran was normal and stable. Then, when the Iranian Revolution started, chaos and violence were everywhere. I was arrested the first time when I was walking down the street. The second time, I was 15, and was arrested on charges of having a book. I can't even remember what the book was. The Revolutionary Guards who were arresting me were about my age themselves, and they were looking for anyone who was trying to educate themselves.\n\nAfter I graduated from high school at 17, my parents told me it was time for me to leave the country. Iran was no longer safe. I used to lie in bed, knowing that someone could knock on the door and take me away. My mother travelled with me to Turkey, but my parents weren't able to leave their homeland. I eventually immigrated to the US, alone, at 18.\n\nGetting into the US was difficult at the time for Iranians, because it was soon after the Iranian Hostage Crisis. I applied to college and was able to get a visa to attend. I'd been accepted to a private college, but I couldn't afford that, so soon after I immigrated, I transferred to a state school.\n\nMy parents were still in Iran, and I needed to support myself. I worked as a gas station cashier, spending shifts behind bulletproof glass. Because I didn't have kids or a family, the long, lonely shifts fell to me. I remember working on Christmas morning, alone and far from my family.\n\nStill, I knew I was going to make something of my life. One day, while working at the gas station, I created a business card for myself. I knew one day I would run a big company, and that gave me the drive to work full-time at the gas station while being enrolled full-time in college.\n\nAfter college, I started working at an accounting firm. I kept focused on my goal of running a big company. It wasn't a dream, it was a knowing: I was determined to get there.\n\nI moved up the ladder at the accounting firm, but I knew if I stayed there, I wouldn't run a company. So I left, taking a job in operations so I could learn more about how a large company runs. I became a chief financial officer and then CEO.\n\nAs CEO of Home Franchise Concepts, I oversaw the integration of private equity, which allowed the company to flourish. When I stepped down in 2019, the company was doing about $1 billion in revenue and had about 1,700 franchisees.\n\nSince those early days at the gas station, my career has been guided by my core values, including a commitment to caring for people. As a CEO and leader, I wanted to do well financially while also doing good for those in my community.\n\nThe same principle guided me as a mom. I wanted to be an engaged, nurturing mother to my son and daughter.\n\nMy kids grew up with a very different lifestyle than I did. And yet, everyone has challenges and changes in their lives, which, by definition, constitute adversity. I believe there's a superpower in adversity, because it allows you to learn.

    "title": "Russia's Oil Revenue, the Lifeblood of Its War Machine, Is Plummeting",
    "description": "The new reality has forced the Kremlin to raise taxes and increase debt, and hovers over peace talks with Ukraine.",
    "fullText": "As Russia holds direct peace talks with Ukraine for the first time in months, the Kremlin’s most potent fuel for the war, oil revenue, is under mounting strain.\n\nThe price of Russian oil, the country’s primary export, has declined under the weight of surging global supplies and Western sanctions related to the war. Last year, Russia’s oil and gas revenue fell by almost a quarter, according to the Finance Ministry. The Kremlin is resorting to tax increases and deficit spending to bridge the gap.\n\nSo far, there is little sign that the economic strains, and any discontent they generate among business leaders and the public, will be enough to change President Vladimir V. Putin’s calculations on the war. Trilateral negotiations involving Russia, Ukraine and the United States are set to continue on Sunday in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nBut with the economy stagnating and the Kremlin reaching the limit of what it can squeeze from it, the Russian people will have to bear more of the burden of a war whose costs exceed about $170 billion a year.\n\n“This situation is manageable,” said Yevgeny Nadorshin, an economist in Moscow who advises companies and banks. “But no one is comfortable with that.”\n\nThroughout his decades-long rule, Mr. Putin has taken pride in the stability he has brought to a Russian economy that was in free fall after the demise of the Soviet Union — slashing debt, streamlining taxes and taming inflation.\n\nA strong oil economy allowed the Russian state to deliver an improved standard of living. That, the Kremlin hoped, would keep the public content even as the government eroded personal freedoms.\n\nNow, the carefully cultivated economic stability is fracturing. The steep drop in oil revenue has sent Russia into a new era defined by sustained budget deficits, higher taxes and stubborn inflation.\n\nRussia’s oil trade has been battered by two forces. Oil prices have declined since April, after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided to gradually increase production after years of cuts. The Russian oil industry has also been hit in recent months by new Western sanctions and the heavier enforcement of existing ones.\n\nIn October, President Trump imposed sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft, which is state-owned, and Lukoil, which is private. Those penalties significantly undercut the companies’ ability to sell crude. Since then, Russia has also faced stepped-up enforcement of restrictions against the illicit “shadow fleet” of tankers it uses to ship oil.\n\nThis month, the U.S. military seized a Russian-flagged vessel in the North Atlantic that had been used to carry Venezuelan oil. The French Navy also intercepted a tanker in the Mediterranean suspected of using a false flag and belonging to a Russia-linked fleet.\n\nBecause of the current global oversupply, buyers now have more alternatives to Russian crude. This allows them to either walk away entirely or demand significantly higher discounts to compensate for the risk of handling goods hit with sanctions, said Sergey Vakulenko, an energy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n“Had it not been for this noticeable decrease in oil prices,” he said, “all these measures would have been far less effective.”\n\nDiscounts on Russian oil have grown drastically. The economy ministry said this month that the average price of Russian oil was $39 per barrel in December, down from more than $57 in August.\n\nAdding to Moscow’s problems, Ukraine has been using drones since November to strike Russia-linked tankers in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. The Ukrainian military has also been attacking Russian refineries. That has contributed to fuel crises in several regions, forcing the government to temporarily ban the export of oil products.\n\n“The only factor that can change the situation is economic pressure on Russia,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on Friday. “Russia must run out of money for the war to start coming to an end.”\n\nThis is not the first time that Mr. Putin has dealt with a drop in oil prices. But in previous years, the Russian state had more options. It could cut expenditures or allow the currency to weaken to replenish the budget. But the costs of the war, which amount to about 30 percent of Russia’s $580 billion annual budget, make it hard to reduce expenses. And the currency, the ruble, has remained strong.\n\nPropped up by restrictions on imports and high interest rates, the ruble surged by about 45 percent against the U.S. dollar in 2025. A strong ruble means that the government receives less money for each barrel of crude that is sold.\n\nWith options dwindling, the Kremlin had little choice but to increase state debt as well as personal and corporate taxes. The Russian government also increased taxes on smaller enterprises like bakeries and shops, causing a rare uproar among owners.\n\nRussia’s budget deficit reached $72 billion in 2025, nominally the highest since 2009. Mr. Nadorshin, the economist, said he expected it to increase further this year.\n\n“The situation is becoming more complicated,” he said, “and it’s clear that the pace of this complication is, naturally, worrying.”",

    "fullText": "SOUTH GOA, INDIA, Jan 30 (Reuters) - A rare combination of rising fuel demand and expanding refining capacity is drawing global commodity traders ​to India, with firms such as Trafigura seeking long-term partnerships with state oil companies.\n\nAs ‌consumption growth slows in most major economies, trading firm executives told the India Energy Week conference that they see ‌opportunities across crude, refined fuels and liquefied natural gas (LNG).\n\n\"We see massive opportunities in India,\" said Sachin Gupta, chief executive of Trafigura India, pointing to strong demand for diesel, gasoline and liquefied petroleum gas and adding that India would be buying \"a lot\" of liquefied natural gas.\n\nGupta expects Indian oil demand to ⁠reach closer to 9 million barrels ‌per day by 2050, from about 5 million barrels per day currently.\n\nOn Friday, Trafigura said it signed a \"landmark crude supply agreement\" with Bharat Petroleum Corp ‍to supply Iraqi Basrah and Omani crude to the Indian state refiner. BPCL also signed a term agreement with TotalEnergies for the procurement of UAE crude.\n\nIndian Oil Corp (IOC), the country's largest refiner, last year ​signed a five-year import deal with Trafigura to buy 2.5 million metric tons of LNG ‌in a deal valued at $1.3 billion-$1.4 billion.\n\nIOC's head of marketing, S.P. Srivastava told reporters at the conference that the company expects annual diesel demand to grow by 2-3% and gasoline demand to rise by 5-6% by 2030.\n\nIt signed a preliminary agreement with Paris-based Engie at India Energy Week for LNG and other natural gas trading opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region, IOC Chairman A.S.

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The terms of a Russian commitment to U.S. President Donald Trump to temporarily halt its bombardment of Ukraine during one of the country's bleakest winters in years remained unclear Friday, as Ukrainians braced for even worse conditions to come next week.\n\nTrump said late Thursday that President Vladimir Putin had agreed to a temporary pause in targeting Kyiv and other places as the region experiences freezing temperatures that have brought widespread hardship to civilians.\n\n“I personally asked President Putin not to fire on Kyiv and the cities and towns for a week during this ... extraordinary cold,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting at the White House. Putin has “agreed to that,” he said, without elaborating on when the request to the Russian leader was made.\n\nThe White House didn't immediately respond to a query seeking clarity about the scope and timing of any limited pause.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed Friday that Trump “made a personal request” to Putin to stop targeting Kyiv until Feb. 1 “in order to create favorable conditions for negotiations.”\n\nThe mention of Feb. 1 was confusing since that is only two days away. Also, the cold weather is forecast to get much worse from Sunday, with temperatures dropping even further and making the time frame for a pause in attacks hard to understand.\n\nRussia has sought to deny Ukrainian civilians heat, light and running water over the course of the war, in a strategy that Ukrainian officials describe as “weaponizing winter.”\n\nAsked if Moscow agreed to Trump’s proposal, Peskov said, “Yes, of course.” But he refused to answer further questions about whether the agreement covered only energy infrastructure or all aerial strikes, and when the halt on strikes was supposed to start.\n\nRussia struck Ukrainian energy assets in several regions of Ukraine on Thursday but there were no strikes on those facilities overnight, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday.\n\nIn a post on social media, Zelenskyy also noted that Russia has turned its attention to targeting Ukrainian logistics networks and that Russian drones and missiles hit residential areas of Ukraine overnight, as they have most nights during the war.\n\nTrump framed Putin's acceptance as a concession. But Zelenskyy was skeptical as Russia’s invasion approaches its fourth anniversary on Feb. 24 with no sign that Moscow is willing to reach a peace settlement despite a U.S.-led push to end the fighting.\n\n“I do not believe that Russia wants to end the war. There is a great deal of evidence to the contrary,” Zelenskyy said Thursday. Ukraine is ready to halt its attacks on Russia’s energy infrastructure, including oil refineries, if Moscow also stops its bombardment of the Ukrainian power grid and other energy assets, he said.\n\nRussia fired 111 drones and one ballistic missile at Ukraine overnight, injuring at least three people, the Ukrainian Air Force said.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said that its air defenses overnight shot down 18 Ukrainian drones over several Russian regions, as well as the illegally annexed Crimea and the Black Sea.\n\nForecasters say Kyiv, which recently endured severe power shortages, will see a brutally cold stretch starting Friday that is expected to last into next week. Temperatures in some areas will drop to minus 30 degrees Celsius (minus 22 Fahrenheit), the State Emergency Service said.\n\nThe possibility of a respite in energy sector attacks was discussed at last weekend’s meeting in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, between envoys of Ukraine, Russia and the United States, Zelenskyy said, adding that he had agreed to adhere to a “reciprocal approach” on energy assaults.\n\n“If Russia does not strike us, we will … take corresponding steps,” he told reporters.\n\nFurther talks were expected on Sunday in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates, but that could change because of a spike in tensions between the United States and Iran.\n\nIt was unclear whether and how any partial truce might work amid ongoing wider fighting and mistrust between the two countries.\n\n“There is no ceasefire. There is no official agreement on a ceasefire, as is typically reached during negotiations,” Zelenskyy said. “There has been no direct dialogue and no direct agreements on this matter between us and Russia.”\n\nUkraine had originally proposed a limited energy ceasefire at talks in Saudi Arabia last year, Zelenskyy said, but it gained no traction.\n\nDisagreement over what happens to occupied Ukrainian territory, and Moscow’s demand for possession of territory it hasn’t captured, are a key issue holding up a peace deal, according to Zelenskyy.\n\n“We have repeatedly said that we are ready for compromises that lead to a real end to the war, but that are in no way related to changes to Ukraine’s territorial integrity,” Zelenskyy said. “The American side understands this and says that there is a compromise solution regarding a free economic zone.”\n\nUkraine demands control over such a zone, he said.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "Electric and gas providers more than doubled rate increase requests to state regulators last year, often citing soaring demand from AI data centers.",
    "fullText": "The average American's skyrocketing electric bill has caught the attention of everyone from President Donald Trump to Microsoft executives — just don't expect lower rates in 2026.\n\nElectric and gas utilities asked state regulators to approve $31 billion in rate increases last year, more than double the $15 billion they sought in 2024, a new study from PowerLines, a nonprofit that advocates for utility customers, found.\n\nThe surge in requests from utilities to tack on additional charges to customer bills comes as Big Tech companies continue their sweeping buildout of power-hungry AI data centers across the country. Many utilities have attributed rate increases to unprecedented demand from data centers.\n\nWhile some of those requests are still pending approval, many — including the majority of a $9 billion increase for customers of one Florida power company — have been pushed through and will start showing up on customer bills this year.\n\n\"Gas and electricity are the two fastest drivers of inflation, and not by a little bit more. It's significantly more than what we're used to seeing,\" said Charles Hua, founder and executive director of PowerLines.\n\nTo track rate hikes, PowerLines used publicly available data from investor-owned utilities in the US.\n\nCustomers in southern states were hit hardest by rate-hike requests last year, PowerLines found. Utilities in the region sought approval for more than $14 billion in rate increases. Much of that came from Florida Power and Light's $9 billion rate hike request — nearly all of which regulators approved.\n\nFPL cited population growth and extreme weather events as key factors in its decision to raise rates by such a significant amount.\n\nIn Virginia, residential customers of Dominion Energy, which also delivers power to the world's largest data center hub, will see their bills increase by an average of $13.60 by 2027.\n\nInvestor-owned utilities in the US are on track to spend $1.1 trillion on a massive expansion of the power grid between 2025 and 2029, according to the Edison Electric Institute, a powerful industry lobbying group. It has cited data centers and AI as key drivers of utility spending.\n\nThe majority of residential ratepayers in the US are customers of investor-owned utilities like NextEra Energy, Duke Energy, and Southern Company. These large, publicly traded companies turn a profit for shareholders by recovering the costs of constructing new power plants and lines, plus interest, from their customer bases.\n\nBig Tech and its enormous appetite for power are facing growing public backlash.\n\nEarlier this month, Microsoft said it would be a \"good neighbor\" and \"pay its own way\" for the electricity it uses as it scales its AI data center fleet.\n\nIn a Truth Social post preceding Microsoft's announcement, Trump said his administration will work with tech companies to ensure their data center electricity consumption won't drive up bills for everyone else.\n\n\"I never want Americans to pay higher electricity bills because of data centers,\" Trump said in the post.\n\nSome power grid researchers are skeptical of the forecast demand. They have warned that utilities risk overbuilding new power plants and transmission lines that will have to be paid for but ultimately won't be needed.\n\nHua is pushing regulators to take a closer look at forecast power demand from utilities, which stand to profit from building new infrastructure that could lead to rate hikes. Steering utilities to first consider the latest electric grid-enhancing technologies before building new power plants to serve data centers could also help lower customer electric bills, Hua said.\n\n\"Utilities don't profit on making the grid more efficient. They are constantly trying to build new infrastructure. That's their job,\" said Hua. \"This moment is the perfect justification.\"",

    "fullText": "A wave of affordable Chinese-made EVs is accelerating the shift away from petrol cars, challenging long‑held assumptions about how transport decarbonisation unfolds\n\nDon’t get Down to Earth delivered to your inbox? \nLast year, almost every new car sold in Norway, the nature-loving country flush with oil wealth, was fully electric. In prosperous Denmark, which was all-in on petrol and diesel cars until just before Covid, sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) reached a share of 68%. In California, the share of zero-emissions vehicles hit 20%. And at least every third new car now bought by the Dutch, Finns, Belgians and Swedes burns no fuel.\n\nThese figures, which would have felt fanciful just five years ago, show the rich world leading the shift away from cars that pump out toxic gas and planet-heating pollutants. But a more startling trend is that electric car sales are also racing ahead in many developing countries. While China is known for its embrace of electric vehicles (EVs), demand has also soared in emerging markets from South America to south-east Asia. BEV sales in Turkey have caught up with the EU’s, data published this week shows.\n\nIs the electric car revolution finally entering the fast lane? Let’s take a look – after this week’s most important reads.\n\nThe Fukushima towns frozen in time: nature has thrived since the nuclear disaster but what happens if humans return?\n\nThe UK government didn’t want you to see this report on ecosystem collapse. I’m not surprised\n\nThe 16-month battle to reveal the truth about Sydney Water’s poo balls\n\nFor decades, climate progress has largely come from cleaning up the power sector. Burn gas instead of coal, or replace power plants with wind turbines or solar panels, and you can slash the amount of planet-heating gas spewed into the atmosphere for little cost.\n\nNow, early signs suggest transportation may be on the brink of delivering similar wins. EVs have quickly gained ground in markets outside Europe and North America, avoiding a rise in fuel-burning vehicles and “leapfrogging” the development path that richer countries have taken in transport.\n\n“Five years ago you might have thought [transportation] is really going to be a bottleneck [for climate progress],” says William Lamb, a scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. “But now with the widescale adoption of EVs, it’s looking a little bit easier.”\n\nThe EV race has gone global, according to a report (pdf) published last month by Ember, a climate thinktank, which looked at BEV and plug-in hybrid sales for the first 10 months of last year. It found 39 countries around the world have an electric sales share above 10%, up from just four countries (all in Europe) in 2019. Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam have overtaken the EU in their EV uptake. India, Mexico and Brazil have overtaken Japan.\n\n“It’s good news that we’re seeing growth in the EV market in more countries now,” said Robbie Andrew, a scientist who tracks electric vehicle sales at Cicero, a research centre in Oslo, the world’s EV capital. “In developing countries, this is largely about the recent arrival of much cheaper models from China. The Chinese companies have innovated extraordinarily quickly.”\n\nHalf of the cars registered in China last year were electric, and carmakers such as BYD have driven the boom in much of the global south. The Ember report found that three of the ten largest-value markets for Chinese EV exports are outside the OECD – Brazil, the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia – while the value of its exports to non-OECD countries and Mexico has tripled in the last two years.\n\nThe countries that benefit range from Ethiopia, which in 2024 became the first nation to ban imports of combustion engine cars, to Nepal, a polluted country scarred by a blockade 11 years ago that left it with severe petrol shortages. But it is not just the Chinese driving progress. Turkey’s share of BEV sales hit 17% last year – the same as the EU’s – in a transition led by domestic carmaker Togg. It has overtaken Tesla as the country’s leading supplier, with BYD in third place.\n\nThe question of whether to buy an electric vehicle has also been complicated by a culture war surrounding some of the brands that make them. Tesla has seen sales plummet across Europe and the US in response to Elon Musk’s support for far-right parties, and promotion of racist conspiracy theories. But in Turkey, the brand is viewed somewhat more favourably.\n\n“If you have a Togg in Turkey, some people think you are a government-lover and a political Islamist,” says Berke Astarcioğlu, an engineer from Istanbul and an early adopter of EVs. “But if you have a Tesla, you are seen as secular, educated and open-minded.”\n\nA challenge for developing countries seeking to sustain the EV boom is whether they can build charging infrastructure fast enough to avoid customer frustration. About two-thirds of the growth in public chargers since 2020 has occurred in China, which now has about 65% of the global charging stock, a report by the International Energy Agency found last year. But charging infrastructure in many other markets is lagging behind EV adoption rates.\n\nThere are also fears the surge in EVs may taper out as the rich customer base in lower- and middle-income countries is exhausted. New cars are generally bought by wealthier residents, while others buy theirs second-hand.\n\nStill, in places like Turkey and Thailand (to name two of many), where falling prices and rising subsidies bring the price of EVs in line with petrol cars, Andrew says the question of whether only the rich can afford them falls away. “With price parity, people buy the cars because they’re simply better and cost less to run.”\n\nIf that trend continues to spread around the world, we may soon see electric cars leave their fume-belching rivals in the dust.\n\nPowering up: how Ethiopia is becoming an unlikely leader in the electric vehicle revolution\n\n‘My Tesla has become ordinary’: Turkey catches up with EU in electric car sales\n\nThe electric vehicle revolution is still on course – don’t let your loathing of Elon Musk stop you joining up",

    "fullText": "Saturday’s NBA slate packs in six games with playoff energy and clear betting angles. From Charlotte’s hot streak against San Antonio to Houston hosting an injury-hit Dallas side, every matchup has a story behind it. Some teams rely on rebounding, others on star scorers, and a few are just trying to survive tough stretches. Here is a closer look at who holds the edge and why these games matter. (Odds via CBS Sports)\n\nDate: Saturday, January 31, 2026\n\nVenue: Spectrum Center, Charlotte\n\nCharlotte enters this game riding a five-game winning streak. The Hornets have been strong on the glass, ranking near the top of the East in rebounding at 45.7 per game. Moussa Diabate leads them with 8.4 rebounds. San Antonio also rebounds well at 46.3 per game, with Luke Kornet setting the pace.\n\nVictor Wembanyama continues to anchor the Spurs with 24.3 points and 11.2 rebounds per game. Miles Bridges leads Charlotte at 18.5 points, while Brandon Miller has averaged 23.4 points over the last 10 games.\n\nRecent form favors Charlotte slightly. Over the last 10 games, the Hornets average 116.5 points and allow only 107.4. San Antonio has scored 110.7 in the same span. Home momentum and the +4.5 line make Charlotte the safer side.\n\nPredicted winner: Charlotte Hornets\n\nDate: Saturday, January 31, 2026\n\nVenue: Gainbridge Fieldhouse, Indianapolis\n\nIndiana struggles in blowout games and owns an 8-24 record in the East. Still, the Pacers play closer games at home. Andrew Nembhard averages 17.4 points and 7.4 assists, while Pascal Siakam has scored 20.8 per game over the last 10.\n\nAtlanta is 12-17 against conference teams and recently beat Indiana 132-116. Onyeka Okongwu leads the Hawks with 16.3 points and 7.9 rebounds. Nickeil Alexander-Walker has added 19.7 points per game over the last 10.\n\nThe Pacers shoot only 44.3 percent this season, but Atlanta allows 47.5 percent to opponents. With a short spread and home court edge, Indiana has a narrow path to control the pace.\n\nPredicted winner: Indiana Pacers\n\nDate: Saturday, January 31, 2026\n\nVenue: Xfinity Mobile Arena, Philadelphia\n\nNew Orleans comes in at 12-37 and allows 121.2 points per game. Defense has been the main issue. The Pelicans still rebound well at 44 per game and force nearly 15 turnovers. Zion Williamson remains their focal point, averaging 21 points in the last outing with 11 rebounds.\n\nPhiladelphia is 25-21 and just beat Milwaukee 139-122. Paul George scored 32 in that win. The 76ers average 116.6 points but sit near the bottom of the league in shooting efficiency at 45.8 percent.\n\nThe Pelicans allow 48.3 percent shooting, which keeps games close late. A large spread gives New Orleans room to stay competitive even if they do not lead for long stretches.\n\nPredicted winner: New Orleans Pelicans\n\nDate: Saturday, January 31, 2026\n\nMinnesota holds a 29-19 record and ranks fifth in scoring at 119 points per game. Julius Randle just dropped 31 points in a win over Dallas. The Timberwolves shoot 48.1 percent and allow only 114.1 points.\n\nMemphis sits at 18-27 and struggles offensively at 45.4 percent shooting. Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 26 in the last game, but team rebounding remains an issue. The Grizzlies were outworked on the boards by Charlotte in their last loss.\n\nThe Timberwolves force turnovers and defend the three well at 35.2 percent allowed. With better balance on both ends, Minnesota should control the matchup.\n\nPredicted winner: Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nDate: Saturday, January 31, 2026\n\nChicago enters after three straight losses but still averages 118.7 points over the last 10 games. Nikola Vucevic posts 17 points and 9.1 rebounds, while Coby White leads fast-break scoring.\n\nMiami has gone 6-4 in its last 10 and scores 121.3 points per game in that span. Bam Adebayo averages 18 points and shoots 44.5 percent. The Heat won the last meeting 116-113.\n\nThe Bulls shoot 47.6 percent this season, slightly higher than what Miami allows. With a +5.5 line, Chicago can stay within range even if Miami controls the fourth quarter.\n\nPredicted winner: Chicago Bulls\n\nDate: Saturday, January 31, 2026\n\nDallas is 19-29 and missing key players like Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis. Cooper Flagg has been productive, but the Mavericks give up 116.7 points per game.\n\nHouston stands at 29-17 and thrives when limiting turnovers. Kevin Durant averages 26.5 points, while Alperen Sengun adds steady scoring inside. The Rockets allow only 110 points per game, which ranks among the league’s best marks.\n\nDallas won the last meeting, but the injury list has grown. Houston’s defense and depth give them a strong edge at home.\n\nPredicted winner: Houston Rockets\n\nThese six games shape a busy Saturday card. Charlotte and Indiana look strong at home. Minnesota and Houston hold the clearest advantages. New Orleans and Chicago bring value due to large spreads. Each matchup carries a different style of play, which should make January 31 a full night of competitive basketball.\n\nThe post NBA schedule for January 31: Matchups and predicted winners appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "The Buffalo Bills introduced current offensive coordinator Joe Brady as the franchise’s 21st head coach Thursday during a press conference at One Bills Drive.\n\nOn a frigid Western New York day, surrounded by president of football operations Brandon Beane, reigning NFL MVP Josh Allen and many members of the Bills, Brady said he believes in “being the weather,” a reference to his high-energy approach to being Buffalo’s newest head coach.\n\n“It starts with a new energy, a new mentality and a new vision,” said Brady, who at 36 years old is currently the youngest head coach in the league.\n\n“I’m going to bring the energy every single day. I believe people are going to feed off that. I truly believe in being the temperature. I’m the weather, and they’re going to feel it every single day, a mentality. I believe in everything about these guys right here.”\n\nToday’s edition of Buffalo Rumblinks leads off by recapping Brady’s introductory press conference and offering up the important takeaways for Bills fans as the Joe Brady era begins in Orchard Park, NY.\n\nAfter interviewing nine total candidates for their head coaching vacancy following the firing of Sean McDermott, current offensive coordinator Joe Brady was named Buffalo’s next head coach because he was “the perfect fit for our team, right now,” according to Brandon Beane.\n\nBrady now takes over as one of the key voices in the organization, and during his press conference, Brady made sure to emphasize that he is bringing a new vision to the team while also paying respect for the foundation of success established by McDermott during his nine years coaching the Bills.\n\n“Over the past four years, I’ve learned a tremendous amount of things from coach McDermott,” Brady said. “How to lead, resilience, standards. The past nine years in this organization matter. I’m understanding of that. I’m appreciative of the opportunity to be a part of it. They matter deeply, and they deserve respect. I’m so grateful for coach McDermott. I love coach McDermott, and I’m going to do whatever I can to build upon the things he laid, and the foundation he laid.”\n\nLinked below: learn more about the key developments and takeaways from Brady’s press conference, including how Brady emphasized that this is Josh Allen’s team, and the organization’s singular focus is helping their quarterback finally win a Super Bowl.\n\n“Every decision this organization makes is with the thought of Josh Allen and the players in mind,” Brady said. “I’d be crazy not to.”\n\nJoe Brady tabbed as ‘the perfect fit’ in being named 19th head coach in Bills history – Buffalo News (subscription required)\n\nWhat we learned from Joe Brady’s introductory news conference as Bills head coach – The Athletic (subscription required)\n\nJoe Brady brings the gusto, but what will new Buffalo Bills coach change?

    "description": "No matter their industries, many successful women swear by incorporating exercise into their daily routines to boost energy and mental health.",
    "fullText": "The start of a new year always brings new exercise routines — or at least the intentions to start them.\n\nIf you're anything like me, though, you might need a little encouragement and inspiration to get going.\n\nSo Business Insider spoke with successful women who make time for fitness regimens each week. They shared the workouts they love, and the gym essentials they swear by.\n\nJanel Barden, 27, is a cofounder of the talent and marketing agency LuxeHaus Management.\n\nIdeally, she likes to exercise between three and five times a week. When her schedule is extra busy, though, she uses a simple piece of equipment to enhance shorter exercises: $65 Bala Bangles.\n\nEach bracelet weighs two pounds and attaches with elastic straps.\n\n\"I love wearing them on walks, and when I'm at home doing a five to 10-minute arm workout I found on YouTube,\" Barden said.\n\nBarden uses ClassPass to vary her workouts. Sometimes, she does Pilates. Other times, she visits the gym, and most recently, she started working with a personal trainer.\n\nNo matter the workout, she's almost always wearing Alo Yoga clothes. She said its pieces are cute and comfortable.\n\nBarden specifically loves the brand's $138 sweatpants and $148 quarter-zip pullover from its Accolade collection, as well as the $78 bra and $134 leggings from its Airlift line.\n\nOccasionally, though, she'll swap her Alo pants for Lululemon's $108 Align leggings.\n\nVictoria Villanueva, 25, cofounded LuxeHaus Management with Barden. She said that exercise is vital to staying active and boosting her mental health while working from home.\n\n\"I've been really into bike riding lately,\" she said. \"I used to go all the time with my dad when I was little, and getting back into it now as an adult is healing something inside me. It's better than taking walks.\"\n\nTo hydrate before and after those rides, she relies on her $40 Stanley 1913 tumbler.\n\nVillanueva told Business Insider that her exercise wardrobe includes a mix of Halara leggings, Fabletics sets, and one accessory: the $349 Ultrahuman Ring Air in bionic gold.\n\n\"It's a dupe for the Oura Ring, but you don't have to pay for a monthly subscription,\" she said.\n\nIt helps her track her steps, heart rate, sleep, and more.\n\nSabrina Guler is the 32-year-old founder of Intuitive CEO, an advisory studio that helps new brands grow and raise capital.\n\nHer exercise regimen starts before she really gets moving each day.\n\n\"Drinking electrolytes before coffee every morning has completely changed my energy levels and hydration,\" she said. \"I avoid sugar-based options and use Ultima electrolytes.\"\n\nThe brand sells packets in sets for around $20.99 per bag.\n\n\"My 45-minute morning walk helps with insulin regulation, cortisol balance, and mental clarity,\" Guler told Business Insider. \"Hormones are everything.\"\n\nThe specific clothing pieces she wears on those walks might vary, but the brands don't.\n\n\"If I want to be seen and look cute, I am wearing Alo Yoga,\" she said. \"If I want to be comfortable, Lululemon has functional pieces. The butter-soft leggings still have me in a chokehold years later.\"\n\nNikki Seaman, 30, is the founder and CEO of Freestyle Snacks. Her brand, which recently appeared on \"Shark Tank,\" offers premium olives and pickles in to-go pouches.\n\n\"I do strength training two or three times a week, and I try to walk outside on the other days,\" she told Business Insider. \"I started strength training after my first son was born, and it has totally changed me physically and mentally.\"\n\nDuring those workouts, she wears $110 performance joggers from Vuori and $155 Clifton 10 sneakers from Hoka.\n\nShe described both as comfortable, durable, and easy to throw on before heading outside.",

    "description": "An X post about rejecting a candidate over their \"olive oil\" interest went viral. Four recruiters shared their reactions with Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "Some people like reading or long walks. Others like olive oil.\n\nBut would you list olive oil as an interest on your résumé? That's the latest internet debate after a post about the interests section on résumés went viral on X.\n\nThe person, who said they were reviewing résumés for a banking role, wrote that applicants needed to be \"normal\" and \"well adjusted.\"\n\n\"I reviewed a resume that listed 'olive oil' as an interest. That is not an interest,\" they wrote. \"It's been hours and I cannot stop thinking about it. There will not be an interview.\"\n\nThe identity of the X user, @90daysliquidity, isn't clear, but they list \"Tech Analyst\" in their bio. They did not respond to a direct message from Business Insider.\n\nCannot stress how much of an advantage it is to be a normal, well adjusted, applicant for banking roles. \n\nI reviewed a resume that listed “olive oil” as an interest. That is not an interest. It’s been hours and I cannot stop thinking about it. There will not be an interview.\n\nThe post caused a stir online. Memes abound, both celebrating and scoffing at the supposed olive oil-enjoyer.\n\nAn employee at Elon Musk's xAI commented that they would hire a \"cracked finance professional\" who is interested in olive oil.\n\n\"If you have olive oil as an interest on your resume, we want to talk to you,\" the official Coinbase account posted.\n\nIs it really so bad to list \"olive oil\" — or any offbeat hobby — on your résumé? Business Insider asked five recruiters what they thought.\n\nPaula Mathias Fryer would want to see just one more word added.\n\nThe SLO Partners senior director from California has been a technical recruiter for 15 years. She would have preferred olive oil \"taster\" or \"grower,\" she told Business Insider.\n\n\"It would have explained it a bit more,\" she said. \"Just those two words is a bit odd.\"\n\nBrianne Sterling, a New York-based director at Selby Jennings who leads investment banking recruitment, also wants more information. Are they just eating olive oil all day long?\n\n\"Do you make your own olive oil?\" Sterling said. \"If someone made their own olive oil, I would find that really interesting, and I might want to speak to them.\"\n\nSterling is a fan of chocolate, but doesn't plan on putting it on her résumé anytime soon.\n\nHobbies offer a common interest between the applicant and the hirer, Sterling said. She listed some popular ones in investment banking: football, basketball, travel, and World War II history.\n\nIt poses a question: what makes a good résumé hobby?\n\nThe off-limits topics are more obvious: politics, religion, anything you wouldn't talk about at the dinner table. Picking the best hobby, on the other hand, depends on the recruiter.\n\nMargaret Buj, a London-based principal recruiter at Mixmax, wants candidates to be interesting. Olive oil was \"weird\" to her — but better than the answers that are \"cliché and vague.\"\n\n\"Traveling, socializing, reading,\" Buj said. \"Who cares? We all do that.\"\n\nSpace on a one-page résumé is a precious resource. Hobbies don't display relevant work experience, and they don't directly show what your contribution to the team would be. Is it even worth listing them?\n\nMathias-Fryer used to vote no. She saw hobbies as \"less professional,\" an unnecessary waste of space. Then came AI, which has upended recruitment and filled hiring managers' inboxes with identical, ChatGPT-generated CVs.\n\nApplicants now need to do \"whatever they can do to stand out,\" she said. \"If that's a hobby, so be it.\"\n\nMatt Stevenson disagrees. The New York-based managing director of executive search agency 33eleven loves to see a quirky hobby. It's another thing to connect about, he said. But, on the candidate side, Stevenson thought that hobbies were too risky.\n\n\"You don't know who is going to be reviewing that résumé, what their hobbies are, and what their personality is like,\" he said.\n\nAs for that X user, endlessly thinking about the olive oil-loving applicant?\n\n\"I would pick up the phone and call the guy,\" he said. \"Scratch that itch.\"",

    "fullText": "LONDON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Former Nigerian oil minister Diezani Alison-Madueke had no real influence over the awarding of lucrative government contracts and was merely a \"rubber stamp\" for official recommendations, her lawyer said on ​Thursday at her London corruption trial.\n\nAlison-Madueke, minister for petroleum resources between 2010 and 2015 under then-president Goodluck Jonathan, has pleaded not ‌guilty to five counts of accepting bribes and a charge of conspiracy to commit bribery.\n\nProsecutors say Alison-Madueke \"enjoyed a life of luxury\" in London, with oil and gas industry ‌figures having provided the use of high-end properties and given her lavish gifts to try and influence the awarding of lucrative contracts.\n\nBut her lawyer Jonathan Laidlaw told jurors at London's Southwark Crown Court that purchases were made on Alison-Madueke's behalf \"because Nigerian ministers are forbidden from having bank accounts abroad\".\n\nHe also said Alison-Madueke, 65, disputes the extent to which properties were provided for her use and the amounts of goods she received, but ⁠that \"all that was spent on her personally, in ‌one way or another, was reimbursed\".\n\nLaidlaw said personal expenses were repaid by Alison-Madueke in Nigeria and expenses relating to official business were \"reimbursed from government coffers\", meaning Alison-Madueke received no financial advantage.\n\n\"If there was any financial advantage, ‍it was to Nigeria, enabling the Minister for Petroleum Resources to undertake her ministerial business and ... there was, of course, nothing improper about it,\" he added.\n\nOTHER ALLEGED BRIBE PAYERS NOT CHARGED IN UK\n\nAlison-Madueke, who was also briefly president of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, is standing trial alongside her brother ​Doye Agama, 69, who has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery relating to his church.\n\nTheir co-defendant Olatimbo Ayinde, 54, ‌has pleaded not guilty to one count of bribing Alison-Madueke between 2012 and 2014 and one count of bribery of a foreign public official.\n\nThe trial, expected to conclude in April, is one of the most high-profile cases relating to alleged corruption in oil-rich Nigeria.\n\nProsecutors say that Nigerian businessman Kolawole Aluko spent more than 2 million pounds ($2.8 million) on items for Alison-Madueke at London department store Harrods alone.\n\nAlison-Madueke is also accused of taking bribes, including gifts and payment for her son's school fees, from prominent oil and gas industry figures.\n\nBut, Laidlaw told the jury, ⁠none of the others named in the charges against Alison-Madueke have been charged, ​nor had Britain sought to have them extradited to stand trial.\n\nMINISTER HAD NO REAL ​INFLUENCE, LAWYER SAYS\n\nLaidlaw said Alison-Madueke's role as minister meant she signed off on oil and gas contracts which were awarded by the Nigerian government.\n\nHe told the jury to ask whether Alison-Madueke had \"any ability to exercise influence upon ‍who would be awarded these contracts ⁠or ... was she effectively a rubber stamp, stamping the recommendations that her civil servants made\".\n\nAlison-Madueke's lawyer also acknowledged that Nigeria, which is one of the world's largest producers of oil and the largest in Africa, had long been blighted by corruption.\n\nHe said, ⁠however, that perception of government and business practices may be different in Britain compared to Nigeria.\n\n\"Things which may seem uncomfortable or extravagant to all of us sitting ‌here in Southwark, may well feel very different to 12 people sitting together in Nigeria,\" Laidlaw told the jury.",

    "fullText": "American households will continue to feel the pinch of high energy costs as gas prices are set to increase in the coming year, according to a new analysis.\n\nThe Guardian reported that the Energy Information Administration projects that U.S. homes will pay 4% more for gas in 2026 than in 2024. These increases are being driven by a multitude of factors.\n\nOne is the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, whose effects are felt worldwide. A 2023 analysis by the World Economic Forum found that the war caused household energy prices to nearly double. Increased instances of extreme weather events also affect household prices. Hurricanes and extremes in heat and cold can all lead to intense short-term price surges. Additionally, the current administration's decision to resume exports of liquefied natural gas is only adding to the problem.\n\nThe U.S. exported 100 million tons of LNG last year that was a windfall for producers, but at the expense of domestic consumers. In the first nine months of 2025, American households forked out over $12 billion in additional costs, per Public Citizen.\n\nClark Williams-Derry, an energy analyst, told the Guardian that the effects will be long-lasting: \"This may be something that lasts for a while and will be a severe economic crimp for lower-income families.\"\n\nThe steep cost increases reflect short-term thinking that prioritizes profiteering and convenience above all else. It's hardly unique to the current situation or even the United States; Germans are still paying the price for their overreliance on gas imports from Russia.\n\nFor households, the problems of using gas as an energy source go beyond the cost. Using a gas stove presents a serious health risk akin to having a car's tailpipe pumping directly into your kitchen.\n\nFortunately, there is a cost-effective way for homes to move past cooking with gas without compromising on quality. An induction stove may look like an underpowered electric hob, but it performs much better.\n\nIts highly efficient design applies heat directly to the cookware instead of heating a surface. That means the surface remains cool and is a good deal safer for the little fingers that might touch it. Upgrading to an induction stove doesn't have to mean an expensive renovation, as there are several plug-in options starting at around $50.\n\nWhat would it take for you to get rid of your gas stove?\n\nI already have an electric stove\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Despite recent setbacks in the Champions League, Cristian Chivu has no doubts about the work he's doing. The former Inter professional, who took over from Simone Inzaghi in the summer, believes his team are on the right track in both Serie A and Europe. “My team have grown mentally over the past two months – they are playing with more conviction and ambition,” said the Romanian. “Ups and downs are part of any development.” Despite his great respect for the difficult task ahead, his anticipation prevails: “We know it’s not easy to play here. There’s a lot of energy in this stadium. Dortmund rarely lose at home. But even they have their problems sometimes.”\n\nDefender Yann Bisseck expressed similar optimism. The Cologne-born Germany international continues to believe in a conciliatory end to the first half of the season – including a possible jump back into the top eight teams. “BVB are very strong and reached the Champions League final in 2024. In this atmosphere, it’s crucial to keep a cool head,” said Bisseck. He is not intimidated by the Yellow Wall: “We’re not afraid. We also play at San Siro, which is a special stadium.”\n\nLike Borussia, who dropped from sixth to 16th place after a 2-2 draw with Bodø/Glimt and a 2-0 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur and go into the last matchday of the league phase with 11 points, Inter Milan were also unable to defend a good starting position (see facts). Victories over Ajax (2-0), Slavia Prague (3-0), Union Saint-Gilloise (4-0) and Kairat Almaty (2-1) had put the Nerazzurri in third place early on and fuelled hopes of early direct qualification for the round of 16, which is only guaranteed for the top eight teams.\n\nThis prospect is now only realistic with the help of other clubs. For the first time in the club's history, Inter failed to pick up any points in three consecutive Champions League matches – against Atlético Madrid (2-1), Liverpool (1-0) and Arsenal (3-1). As a result, they have fallen to 14th place. The away game in Dortmund is their fourth attempt to get points on the board against a major European rival.\n\nAt least the 20-time Italian champions, who will be without the injured EURO 2020 winner Nicolo Barella, are not in danger of being eliminated prematurely. With 12 points, they are guaranteed a place in the play-offs even if they lose. The teams ranked 9th to 24th will play home and away matches for the remaining places in the round of 16. With only one point separating them from sixth to eighth place, Inter could avoid this additional round by winning in Dortmund.\n\nChivu's team are performing very differently in Serie A. Ten games without defeat have put Inter at the top of the table, five points ahead of city rivals AC Milan. Even a 0-2 deficit had no consequences in the recent 6-2 win against bottom-of-the-table Pisa. Nevertheless, there is a parallel to their European record at national level: they have only managed one win against their direct rivals AC Milan, Roma, Napoli and Juventus.\n\nInter are taking heart from their positive history against BVB. The two clubs met in the semi-finals of the 1963/64 European Cup, the quarter-finals of the 1993/94 UEFA Cup and the group stage of the 2019/20 Champions League. With three wins, one draw and two defeats, Inter have a slight edge in the head-to-head record.\n\nThe club, founded in 1908, also has the edge in terms of European titles. After successes in the European Cup in 1964 and 1965, Inter won the Champions League for the third time in 2010 with a 2-0 victory over Bayern Munich. They also have three UEFA Cup triumphs to their name (1991, 1994, 1998). Further title chances have recently gone unused: in 2023, Inter lost to Manchester City (1-0) in the Champions League final and in 2025 to Paris Saint-Germain (5-0).\n\nBVB coach Niko Kovac paid great respect to the current Italian league leaders, whose squad includes two former Dortmund players, Manuel Akanji and Henrikh Mkhitaryan: “We are playing against a really strong team that has been in the final twice in the last three years. It’s anything but easy. Balance will be crucial – we mustn’t be naive” (see preview).",

    "title": "As we breach 1.5°C, we must replace temperature limits with clean-energy targets",
    "description": "Actionable goals are needed to guide the world towards what needs to happen most quickly: shifting economies to clean energy sources.",
    "fullText": "On 28 October 2025, United Nations secretary-general António Guterres acknowledged that the totemic goal of the Paris climate agreement is going to be missed: “The truth is that we have failed to avoid an overshooting above 1.5 °C in the next few years”1.\n\nGuterres was merely stating the obvious. In 2024, Earth’s global mean surface temperature averaged 1.55 °C above pre-industrial levels2, and the average for 2023–25 is 1.48 °C, perilously close to the limit. Keeping to the Paris target now looks impossible by any realistic measure. Yet this moment should not invite despair. Instead, it demands an urgent reframing of how climate progress is measured and mobilized.\n\nThe world today looks very different from that in 2015 when the Paris goal was framed. Although emissions are still rising and global actions on climate change are slow, a lot of progress has been made. Clean energy is expanding rapidly and decarbonization, not fossil fuels, is the new ‘business as usual’. In the first three quarters of 2025, growth in clean electricity generation outpaced that in energy demand for the first time, implying that fossil fuels are being displaced (see go.nature.com/3jvqzcb).\n\nWe argue that the main focus of climate action in 2026 and beyond should be on accelerating the clean-energy revolution. And the rate at which clean energy displaces fossil fuels in the global economy should become the key measure of climate progress. Here we describe how such progress can be tracked and incentivized using a metric we call the clean-energy shift. Unlike chasing intangible temperature targets, cleaning up the energy sector is a more-focused battle that the world can win.\n\nTo move forwards, climate scientists and policymakers must first accept that the Paris 1.5 °C target has outlived its usefulness. Although initially valuable as a unifying focus for international efforts to increase mitigation, continuing to emphasize a failed temperature target might produce more harm than good.\n\nOne reason is the difficulty of determining when and whether the world has crossed the line. Forecasts suggest that Earth is likely to exceed the 1.5 °C threshold around 2028, for instance (see go.nature.com/4pf95x6). But in the terminology of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), “exceedance” of 1.5 °C refers to the midpoint of a 20-year period at that level3. Confirmation would therefore not come until a decade after the fact.\n\nSuch a target, requiring years of expert interpretation to assess, could never have great salience for decision makers. And it challenges public understanding because, by definition, no person experiences global average temperatures. Moving to a higher number when 1.5 °C is crossed, such as 1.6 °C or 1.7 °C, would only make climate target setting seem arbitrary and unrooted in scientific evidence.\n\nMore concerningly, the emphasis on keeping Earth’s temperature below 1.5 °C might serve to justify risky interventions in the climate system. For example, injecting vast amounts of sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere through ‘solar radiation modification’ could be one of the few remaining ways to bring 1.5 °C back into reach. But it might also alter precipitation patterns or result in a burst of warming if the programme were suddenly halted.\n\nMore complex temperature targets won’t help. Discussions have begun around the concept of ‘overshoot’, in which the planet’s average temperature would be brought back to 1.5 °C by 2100 after a period exceeding that level4. But its achievement would be even harder to pin down. While in overshoot, no one can be sure whether it is permanent or temporary. A successful return to 1.5 °C could be confirmed only at the end of the century.\n\nAny approach based on projections to 2100 is unlikely to inspire public interest or political action because the goal is so far off. It is hubristic to think that researchers can predict accurately how emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence will affect the climate, or how Earth’s climate system itself will respond to unprecedented conditions.\n\nInstead, we propose that policymakers focus on rapidly building the clean-energy systems that can deliver the safer climate and thriving economies that populations demand. These goals are already agreed. For example, in 2023 at the UN Conference of the Parties (COP) 28 climate summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, countries called for a tripling of renewable-energy capacity globally by 2030 and the transition away from fossil fuels to reach net zero by 2050. Whereas delegates at COP30 in Belém, Brazil, in 2025, struggled to agree to phase out fossil fuels, support for accelerating clean energy is almost universal.\n\nTo fulfil this mandate, the world needs one clear number with which to measure climate progress during a transition that ends the use of fossil fuels. We think the most promising metric is one we term the ‘clean-energy shift’. Building on a concept initially proposed by Bloomberg New Energy Finance founder Michael Liebreich (see go.nature.com/3zr5y1), we define it as the growth rate in clean-energy generation minus the growth rate in total energy demand for a given time interval.\n\nThis metric emphasizes that clean-energy supply must expand faster than overall energy demand for decarbonization. When the percentage growth of clean-energy supply exceeds the growth in total energy use, fossil fuels get squeezed out of the system. By contrast, simply measuring clean energy share is insufficient, because fossil fuels might also rise overall to meet extra demand.\n\nFor example, if clean-energy grows by 6% each year and total energy demand grows by 3%, the clean-energy shift is +3%, meaning that clean energy is displacing fossil energy as a share of total energy generation. The bigger the number, the faster the exit from fossil fuels.\n\nClean-energy shift measures progress in a positive way5, towards a 100% clean economy, rather than negatively towards net zero. This would reduce the political resistance that arises from the perceived economic sacrifice of limiting emissions. Chasing the number zero will never motivate politicians concerned about economic development. Framing decarbonization as a story of building clean-energy industries and jobs is more appealing. The metric points to policies that are politically feasible, economically desirable and already advancing rapidly technologically, including solar, wind, batteries, geothermal, hydro and nuclear — without picking winners.\n\nThe power of pursuing this approach is evident in recent energy trends. Between 2018 and 2020, the annual percentage growth of clean-energy generation rose sharply, driven by rapid additions of solar, wind and storage capacities. Total global energy demand also grew, but at a slower rate, implying that growth in clean-energy production began eating into the share of fossil fuels. If this clean-energy shift can be increased further, the world would see a peak and then a steady decline in fossil-fuel use and related emissions. Indeed, data from China suggest the nation’s emissions peak could come as soon as this year6.\n\nIt is up to policymakers to determine how high the clean-energy shift should be. For example, to eliminate fossil fuels by 2050, the metric would need to rise substantially, from around 4% over the past five years, and keep climbing through the 2030s and 2040s. This means that clean-energy generation must continue its current rapid growth, rising several percentage points faster than total energy demand each year.\n\nAlthough challenging, trends in solar, wind and storage deployment suggest that this acceleration is achievable — although it will require expanded manufacturing capacity, grids built to integrate renewable technologies, continued reductions in battery costs and political will.\n\nTo achieve global decarbonization by 2050, policymakers need short-term milestones. We suggest they might set global targets of clean-energy shifts in five-year intervals — like rungs on a ladder, each climbing closer to a safe climate. It should be noted that the intervals are non-linear in terms of added capacity: because clean-energy shift is a percentage-growth metric, the higher rungs reflect increasingly rapid rates of clean-energy expansion, rather than a constant yearly addition.\n\nEncouragingly, the world has already climbed the first two rungs. We calculate an average shift of about 3.4% during 2014–19, rising to about 5.7% in 2024. The next rungs would need to sustain or increase these numbers to enable a fossil-fuels exit by 2050. Lower numbers would mean fossil fuels staying longer as part of the energy mix.\n\nThese intervals can be aligned with the five-year timelines used by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) policy process, such as major COP agreements, reviews of ‘nationally determined contributions’ and ‘global stocktakes’ of progress towards the Paris goals for emissions reductions.\n\nThe clean-energy shift metric also respects long-established UN principles of equity and accountability, including the concept of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities’ in climate policy. The metric would not be a legally binding top-down number but the upward product of the collective efforts of all countries, which would continue to determine their own energy policies.\n\nIndividual countries can use the metric to track their own progress. And several major emitters already include clean-energy targets in their Paris commitments. For example, India met its 50% non-fossil power capacity goal five years ahead of its 2030 target. China has more than doubled its wind and solar capacity over the past three years. The European Union currently has about one-quarter of its energy consumption supplied by renewable sources, which it has mandated should rise to 42.5% within five years.\n\nNo metric can cover everything. And the clean-energy shift excludes emissions from sources other than fossil fuels, such as greenhouse gases resulting from deforestation, soil cultivation or wildfires. But the climate damage caused by fossil fuels is unique in its scale — comprising 90% of the carbon dioxide problem (38 of 42 gigatonnes in 2024)7.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-026-00246-z\n\nWatts, J. & Xipai, W. in The Guardian (28 October 2025).\n\nWorld Meteorological Organization.

    "fullText": "LONDON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The captain of a Venezuela-linked crude oil tanker seized by the U.S. this month has been taken from British territorial waters and is now ​aboard a U.S. Coast Guard vessel, a lawyer for the captain's wife said on ‌Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. military special forces, bearing a judicial seizure warrant, apprehended the Russian-flagged Marinera in the ‌Atlantic near Iceland on January 7 after pursuing it for more than two weeks as part of Washington's efforts to block Venezuelan oil exports.\n\nAfter its capture, the tanker was moved to a location off the coast of Scotland.\n\nDespite legal attempts to stop their removal, Captain Avtandil Kalandadze, a Georgian, and ⁠the boat's first officer were taken ‌from Scottish jurisdiction to the U.S. Coast Guard vessel Munro, Aamer Anwar, the lawyer for Kalandadze's wife, Natia Dzadzama, said.\n\nOn Monday, a Scottish court ‍issued an interim order preventing the captain's removal pending a judicial review of his detention, but the order was revoked early Tuesday after the court heard Kalandadze was already outside British territorial waters, Anwar said.\n\n\"Our client's ​judicial review can no longer be enforced now her husband has, in essence, been abducted ‌by the U.S. government on Scottish and British territory,\" he said in a statement.\n\nA British government spokesperson said at the request of U.S. authorities, crew members had been allowed to disembark for onward travel and would be processed in line with appropriate immigration and legal requirements.\n\n\"Deterring, disrupting and degrading the Russian shadow fleet is a priority for this government. Alongside our allies, we are stepping ⁠up our response to shadow vessels – and we will continue ​to do so,\" the spokesperson added, referring to ships ​that transport oil under sanctions.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the U.S. Coast Guard or the Scottish government.\n\nAnwar said the other 26 crew of the Marinera, formerly ‍known as the Bella-1, ⁠had been processed at a British army centre in Inverness. Five had chosen to travel to the United States, while the others chose alternative travel arrangements to their home countries, ⁠Anwar said.\n\nLast week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow had expected the U.S. to free the crew members, ‌which he said included two Russians, as well as Ukrainians, Georgians and Indians.",

Women likely feel that companies are \"too masculine,\" he told Rogan, and that things are \"biased\" against them. But the shift had gone too far, the Facebook cofounder said.\n\n\"It's one thing to say we want to be welcoming and make a good environment for everyone,\" Zuckerberg said. \"It's another to basically say that masculinity is bad.\"\n\nAltman also wrote in his memo that OpenAI didn't \"become super woke when that was popular.\"\n\nMeta didn't respond to Business Insider's request for comment on Altman's remark.\n\nAltman and Zuckerberg are currently engaged in a talent war for top AI researchers and engineers.\n\nZuckerberg has attempted to poach OpenAI employees with eye-popping compensation packages, which Altman in June said included $100 million signing bonuses.\n\nWhile Altman at the time said that he was happy that \"at least so far, none of our best people have decided to take them up on that,\" Zuckerberg successfully hired away some prominent OpenAI talent.\n\nThe Meta CEO, who even hand-delivered soup to an OpenAI employee he was attempting to poach, hired away ChatGPT co-creator Shengjia Zhao and three researchers who helped build OpenAI's Zurich office.",

    "fullText": "Bad weather and geopolitical turmoil have boosted the energy sector to the top of the stock market leaderboard in 2026, and there could be stronger gains to come.\n\nThe S&P 500 energy sector is up more than 10% in 2026, handily outpacing the 1% gain in the broader index. Temperatures have plummeted across the US, raising the outlook for energy demand, while geopolitical tensions have increased the risk to supply.\n\nAdam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at wealth management firm LPL Financial, says there are technical signals flashing in the sector that point to gains piling up from here.\n\n\"Technically, the energy sector has finally cleared resistance off the 2014 and 2024 highs, checking the box for a breakout from its multi-year range,\" Turnquist wrote, adding that the sector could rally another 20% from current levels.\n\n\"From a near‑term perspective, energy appears overbought, making a retracement to the prior breakout level a reasonable expectation,' Turnquiest told Business Insider. \"That area should serve as an important test for the bulls. A successful retest would reinforce the breakout thesis, while a failure to find support would increase the risk of a false breakout.\"\n\nWhile crude oil has steadily declined in the last year on outlooks for heavy supply and uncertain demand, energy markets recently have been boosted by a brutally cold winter in the US and potential disruptions to crude flows amid geopolitical tensions. Commentators have warned of the potential for oil shocks that could send energy prices surging.\n\nTurnquist noted that he thinks oil futures will need to top $62.25, up from their current price of $60.94, in order for the boom in the energy sector to feel sustainable. While it hasn't proven a lasting recovery yet, that type of strength would add to the bull case.\n\n\"For WTI crude, the 200-day moving average near $62.25 will be a big test, as it also overlaps with a prior intra-day high registered earlier this month,\" he said. \"A breakout above this area would raise the probability of the cycle low being reached near $55 but technical evidence suggests it would be too early to call make the call that an uptrend is underway.\"",

    "fullText": "Southern state becoming ground zero in fight against rapid growth of facilities using huge amounts of energy and water\n\nLawmakers in several states are exploring passing laws that would put statewide bans in place on building new datacenters as the issue of the power-hungry facilities has moved to the center of economic and environmental concerns in the US.\n\nIn Georgia a state lawmaker has introduced a bill proposing what could become the first statewide moratorium on new datacenters in America. The bill is one of at least three statewide moratoriums on datacenters introduced in state legislatures in the last week as Maryland and Oklahoma lawmakers are also considering similar measures.\n\nBut it is Georgia that is quickly becoming ground zero in the fight against untrammelled growth of datacenters – which are notorious for using huge amounts of energy and water – as they power the emerging industry of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Georgia bill seeks to halt all such projects until March of next year “to allow state, county and municipal-level officials time to set necessary policies for regulating datacenters … which permanently alter the landscape of our state”, said bill sponsor state Democratic legislator Ruwa Romman.\n\nIt comes at a time when Georgia’s public service commission – the agency that oversees utility company Georgia Power – just last month approved a plan to provide 10 additional gigawatts of energy in the coming years. It was the largest amount of electricity sought for a multi-year plan in the commission’s history, was driven by datacenters and will mostly be supplied by fossil fuels.\n\nThe 10-gigawatt plan – enough to power about 8.3m homes – in turn comes as the Atlanta metro area led the nation in datacenter construction in 2024.\n\nThis accelerated growth has already led at least 10 Georgia municipalities to pass their own moratoriums on datacenter construction, with Atlanta suburb Roswell becoming the most recent earlier this month. Municipalities in at least 14 states have done the same, according to Tech Policy Press.\n\nBernie Sanders, the Vermont independent democratic socialist senator, proposed a national moratorium last month.\n\n“What we’re seeing is, as communities are learning more about this aggressive industry’s presence … [they] want to have time to thoroughly investigate all potential harms,” said Seth Gladstone, spokesperson for Food and Water Watch.\n\nThe rampant development of datacenters to power AI raises several concerns for residents and activists alike. One is their impact on the cost of electricity. “In the public’s mind, datacenters and utility bills are inextricably linked,” said Charles Hua, founder and executive director of PowerLines, an organization that works on lowering utility bills and involving communities in decisions about energy.\n\nHua noted that the relationship between the two varies, depending on each state’s market and regulatory system. In Georgia, he said, the Georgia Power utility company makes profit off new capital investments – so it has incentive to keep building new power plants. This approach has led Georgia’s rates to go up by a third in the last several years alone. Meanwhile, he said, the power company doesn’t have incentive to make the electrical grid more efficient – which “could actually lower prices”, Hua said.\n\nBut datacenter concerns in Georgia also include water use and lost tax revenue. Republicans in the state legislature have introduced bills this year to protect consumers from increases in their utility bills and to end tax breaks for the centers. A Democrat has proposed that datacenters make public how much energy and water they use each year.\n\nRomman is also running for governor. If elected, she would become the first Palestinian American elected to statewide office in Georgia and break the near quarter-century hold Republicans have on the office.\n\nHer bill, HB 1012, has a Republican co-sponsor in state representative Jordan Ridley, who said he signed onto the measure because he wanted to give local governments time to develop zoning regulations on datacenters, since “it seems like they’re being built across the state”.\n\n“Every local government has zoning codes and … they need public input. That takes time,” Ridley said. At the same time, Ridley added, “datacenters … provide tax revenue and high-paying jobs. I’m not against datacenters.”\n\nRomman’s bill is not just a policy proposal; it’s also a political one. In a statement, she wrote that the moratorium “would provide time for Georgians to vote on the majority of the Public Service Commission seats who make final decisions on energy-related projects”.\n\nGeorgia is one of 10 states that elect their utility regulators. Voters in the state elected progressive Democrats Alicia Johnson and Peter Hubbard to the five-member commission in November, leading the agency to lose its all-Republican makeup for the first time in nearly two decades. Another seat is up for a vote this November.\n\nThe calculus: if the commission becomes majority-Democratic, it will no longer give a rubber stamp to electricity demands from Georgia Power driven by tech companies seeking to build datacenters.\n\nHubbard, now in his new position, recently wrote an editorial asserting that Georgia voters “see data centers receiving tax breaks as their power bills go up. They see local communities struggle with competition for water supplies and high voltage transmission lines that reduce property values. And they see how the PSC approved every request placed before it by the monopoly electric utility.\n\n“This is why opposition to data centers is growing in Georgia; because Georgians oppose being treated as collateral damage by the unregulated growth of data centers that will push their power bills even higher.”\n\nThere’s another political implication to Romman’s bill. Paul Glaze, spokesperson for Georgia Conservation Voters, said if the bill crosses from the House to the Senate, “it may be a preview of the potential general election” later this year.\n\n“The question is, in communities where datacenters are coming, who are voters going to trust to have their back?” Glaze said. “Anyone serious about statewide office should have a clear position on this.”",

    "fullText": "LONDON/WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. control of Venezuela's oil exports has ensnared barrels that had been servicing debt to China, lining up another potential showdown between the two superpowers that could further complicate the South American country's path out of default.\n\nAround a tenth of Venezuela's $150 billion foreign debt pile is estimated to be loans from China that ​the OPEC member was paying in oil cargoes - until the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month.\n\nDebt experts said the ramifications of China's claim on the cargoes and any clash with ‌the United States could make it tougher for Venezuela to restructure its debt after a 2017 default and put at risk Beijing's cooperation in restructuring deals for other developing nations.\n\n\"Even under the best circumstances, this was going to be very messy - trying to disentangle where all ‌these creditors stand in the credit hierarchy,\" said Christopher Hodge, chief economist with Natixis and a former U.S. Treasury official.\n\n\"The fact that now America is controlling all the finances into and out of the country...this seems to be unprecedented to me, that we're going to have such entanglements, such opacity about the finances of a government,\" Hodge said.\n\nWhile Washington currently controls only oil sale proceeds, Hodge noted that these are Venezuela's main source of revenue.\n\nDocuments and sources from state-run oil firm PDVSA show three supertankers have been shuttling between Venezuela and China over the last five years carrying oil for interest payments under the terms of a temporary deal struck in 2019. But these shipments are only ⁠a fraction of Venezuela's total crude exports to China.\n\nAidData, a research lab at ‌the U.S. university William & Mary that tracks lending, said some cash proceeds from oil sent to China went into an account controlled by Beijing and on to service the debt - even as sanctions and default blocked payments to many of Venezuela's other creditors.\n\nThe Trump administration has now said that proceeds from the sale of Venezuela's oil will go into ‍a Qatar-based account controlled by Washington, potentially giving the U.S. President himself substantial leverage over which creditors get paid, and when.\n\nIn response to a request for comment on the cargoes and debt payments, China's foreign ministry said Beijing \"has repeatedly stated its position\".\n\nBeijing condemned the redirection of Venezuelan oil exports during a January 7 news conference, adding \"legitimate rights and interests of China and other countries in Venezuela must be protected\".\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Reuters that Trump had brokered an oil deal with Venezuela ​that \"will benefit the American and Venezuelan people\".\n\nThe Trump administration is allowing China to purchase Venezuelan oil but not at the \"unfair, undercut\" prices at which Caracas sold the crude previously, a U.S. official said on Thursday.\n\nTraders managing Venezuelan oil ‌sales have offered some to Chinese refiners, but these are private market transactions, not intended as debt payments.\n\n\"The people of Venezuela will collect a fair price for their oil from China and other nations,\" the U.S. official said.\n\nThe Venezuelan communications ministry, which handles all press inquiries for the government, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nTrump could yet make a deal with China. However, the planned U.S. takeover of Venezuela's oil sector and control of its revenue could upend the hierarchy of creditors, restructuring advisors warn.\n\n\"All of these things will have the practical effect of subordinating the claims of legacy debtholders,\" said global sovereign debt expert Lee Buchheit, adding it was unclear if Trump had the legal right to determine who gets paid first.\n\nSome $60 billion of Venezuela's bonds tipped into default in 2017, and a restructuring agreement is essential to enable it to borrow again and attract new ⁠investment.\n\nIn a typical restructuring, bilateral lenders come together and agree what losses they will accept, usually via the Paris Club of ​creditor nations. This sets the bar for the \"comparable\" losses private lenders - bond investors, banks and others - must take.\n\n\"Comparability of treatment will be ​a real challenge, particularly if the U.S. controls the use of oil revenues,\" said Mark Walker, a longtime sovereign debt advisor who previously worked on potential Venezuelan restructurings.\n\nIf the U.S. pushes China to swallow significant writedowns on its debt - and China digs its heels in - it could slow a restructuring and hinder Venezuela's economic recovery in the process.\n\nThat could ‍keep Venezuela \"in very dire straits during the foreseeable future\", said ⁠Jean-Charles Sambor, head of emerging market debt with TT International, which holds Venezuelan bonds. In turn, this would limit how much the country can afford to repay to bondholders and other creditors.\n\nChina has little immediate leverage. Countries typically do not take other nations to court or arbitration over lending claims, Walker said, and would need to settle the situation \"on a government-to-government basis\".\n\nBut ramifications are possible: China is the ⁠largest bilateral lender to the developing world and its cooperation with the Paris Club has been crucial over the past decade. Beijing agreed restructuring terms via a platform called the Common Framework during Ghana, Zambia and Ethiopia's debt restructuring talks.\n\n\"China's obvious leverage is to refuse ‌to cooperate in future Common Framework sovereign debt workouts until it feels that it has been treated fairly in Venezuela,\" Buchheit said. \"And that threat would have some force.\"",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW, Jan 23 (Reuters) - China is set to ramp up imports of Russian oil in January, absorbing barrels that would have previously gone to India ​and Turkey, as tougher Western sanctions force Moscow to redirect flows, LSEG data ‌and traders said.\n\nThe United States and the European Union imposed sweeping sanctions in late 2025 targeting Russian oil ‌sellers and shippers, including energy giants Rosneft and Lukoil, complicating purchases for global buyers and tightening scrutiny on Russian crude exports.\n\nChina is poised to receive nearly 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of Russian oil by sea this month, compared with 1.1 million bpd in December, according to ⁠preliminary LSEG data. Beijing, already ‌a key consumer of Russian Far East ESPO Blend, also boosted imports of Russian Urals oil to a record high of 405,000 bpd ‍in January, the highest since mid-2023, data provided by energy consultancy Kpler showed.\n\nIndia, previously the largest buyer of Russian Urals by sea since the EU embargo on Moscow's oil in 2022, slashed purchases ​to below 1 million bpd in December, down from an average of 1.3 million ‌bpd last year, LSEG data showed. Indian refiners are expected to keep Russian oil imports near 1 million bpd in January as they diversify supply sources.\n\nTurkey, also a major Russian oil buyer, reduced Urals imports in January to about 250,000 bpd, compared to an average of 275,000 bpd in 2025 and well below the record 400,000 bpd reached in June ⁠last year.\n\n\"As Indian and Turkish buyers cut purchases ​recently, some Russian Urals cargoes headed for China,\" said ​a trader involved in Russian oil sales. He added that the surplus of Urals barrels weighed on prices.\n\nDiscounts for Urals crude delivered to China ‍in late 2025 widened ⁠to as much as $12 per barrel below ICE Brent for some cargoes, while current Urals differentials hover near minus $10 to the benchmark, according to two traders active ⁠in the Asian market.\n\nDemand for Urals in India and Turkey, both major exporters of diesel to Europe, slumped ‌due to the EU ban on fuels produced from Russian-origin crude, the ‌traders added.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 23 (Reuters) - India can leverage its growing energy demand to negotiate better oil and gas ​supply deals, Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Friday, ‌as its refiners continue seeking alternatives to Russian oil.\n\nIndia became the top buyer of discounted ‌Russian seaborne crude after Moscow's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, but challenges posed by Western sanctions eventually prompted Indian refiners to increase imports from other sources.\n\nIndian officials have been careful to avoid directly referencing Russian oil ⁠imports, but Puri said ‌supplies from \"one source\" that had surged after February 2022, were now easing.\n\nData obtained from trade sources showed India's Russian ‍oil imports fell to their lowest level in two years in December, lifting OPEC's share of imports to an 11-month high.\n\nIndia's rising oil demand gives it \"a ​little bit of positioning inside the world\" to negotiate better deals, ‌Puri said.\n\nThe world's third-largest oil importer and consumer should have no trouble covering its needs given ample global supplies and rising output in countries such as Brazil, Guyana, Suriname and the United States.\n\nIndian refiners have been buying more oil from Middle Eastern, African and South American ⁠countries to make up for a drop ​in Russian oil imports, which is expected ​to help India negotiate a tariff deal with Washington.\n\nPuri said Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd had doubled the size of its ‍annual contract with ⁠Brazil's Petrobras.\n\nIndian Oil Corp, the country's top refiner, has bought 7 million barrels of oil, including from Brazil's Petrobras, for March ⁠loading to replace Russian oil, trade sources said.\n\nIOC last month bought its first Colombian ‌oil and for the first time bought Ecuadorean Oriente crude.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Nidhi VermaEditing by Tomasz Janowski)",

    "description": "Despite geopolitical upheaval, sanctions, and military action, this South American state's proven oil reserves remain colossal.",
    "fullText": "When it comes to oil-rich countries, one would usually think of Middle Eastern nations like Saudi Arabia or Iraq. But what many do not know is that the country with the largest oil reserves in the world lies just 1,200 miles to the south of Florida — or about a three-and-a-half-hour flight across the Caribbean. This is the state of Venezuela, and the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that its oil reserves are at more than 303 billion barrels, as of 2025.\n\nMost of Venezuela's oil is in the Orinoco Belt, a swathe of land north of the Orinoco River, but extracting it poses an unusual set of challenges. The country's oil infrastructure needs to be overhauled due to years of mismanagement and corruption and a history of asset seizures from private companies by the state. The country is also under U.S. sanctions, which limit its ability to sell oil overseas.\n\nVenezuela's crude oil isn't easy to process, either. Saudi Arabian and American oil fields produce light, sweet crude oil, which contains very little sulfur, and isn't corrosive to pipes and equipment. On the other hand, Venezuelan oil is much harder to process because it's mostly heavy and sour, making it harder to process crude oil into unleaded gasoline. Prof. Paasha Mahdavi of the University of California, Santa Barbara, told NPR that it's \"among the dirtiest oils in the world to produce when it comes to global warming.\"\n\nAside from Venezuela, other countries that have massive reserves include Saudi Arabia (267 billion barrels), Iran (208 billion barrels), Iraq (145 billion barrels), and the United Arab Emirates (113 billion barrels). The United States sits in the top eight, with an estimated 45 billion barrels of crude oil in reserve.\n\nOne thing that allowed the U.S. to massively increase its oil reserves and become one of the top 10 countries with the largest oil reserves is the development of fracking. Unlike traditional oil extraction techniques, which siphoned oil deposits from porous material, fracking pumps a special type of fluid deep underground to break the dense rock that holds the oil and make it easier to extract.\n\nOther nations are continually exploring to find new oil fields within their borders, and the U.S. made a new discovery in Texas in January 2026, which potentially has 1.6 billion barrels of oil. So, if there's a new substantial find or new technologies are developed to efficiently extract more oil from existing wells, then it's possible that another state can overtake Venezuela as the largest oil reserve holder in the world.",

    "fullText": "In cities across Australia, fleets of nice-looking electric buses quietly ferry thousands of commuters each day. But new warnings from cybersecurity experts have transformed what once looked like a clean energy success story into a geopolitical flashpoint.\n\nOfficials in Australia and the United Kingdom now say some Chinese-made buses may contain code that theoretically lets the buses’ manufacturer shut them down remotely via a so-called “kill switch.”\n\nThe revelation has renewed global fears about foreign-controlled technology embedded in critical infrastructure.\n\nThe spotlight is on the Yutong-made battery-electric buses. It’s a major Chinese manufacturer whose vehicles have been widely purchased in Australia’s capital, Canberra, and other jurisdictions.\n\nBritish reports, citing tests by the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre and Transport for the UK government, found that similar models in Europe could be accessed remotely by the manufacturer’s systems, including diagnostics and software updates, and that, theoretically, such access could be used to stop a bus’s drive system.\n\nThis marks a dramatic escalation in cyber-risk warnings tied that aren’t about phone networks or internet routers but about public transit vehicles. Transport Canberra reportedly responded by launching a fresh investigation into cybersecurity risks linked to the buses, following the British analysis and earlier flags from Norwegian transit authorities who found what they termed a functional remote shutdown capability during tests.\n\nTo cyber researchers, the worry is not that a Chinese government operator is now flipping switches in real time, since there aren’t any confirmed cases of foreign actors actively disabling buses. The concern is that the vulnerability exists at all in imported vehicles that operate on public streets and, in some cases, carry government employees and personnel.\n\n“This isn’t just about buses,” Australian cybersecurity expert Alastair MacGibbon told local media. “It goes to how much control is embedded in the technology we import, and whether those controls could be abused.”\n\nThis episode in neighboring Australia (ally, we mean) reads like vindication for policymakers in the US who have long sounded the alarm over dependencies on Chinese technology.\n\nTransport Secretary Sean Duffy and other hardliners have repeatedly asserted that Chinese-linked vehicles and connected technologies pose unacceptable security risks — even going so far as to say China should never sell cars (or similarly connected vehicles) on American roads “as long as I have breath in my body.”\n\nWhile those comments were dismissed as bluster by critics, the Australian “kill-switch” story has suddenly given them a concrete, globally reported incident to point to.\n\nIn Washington, the Biden administration tightened restrictions on connected vehicles containing Chinese software or hardware, with new rules designed to ban such imports by model year 2027 — a response to precisely the kinds of national security vulnerabilities highlighted by the Australian case.\n\nOpponents of these policies argue that connectivity features, including remote diagnostics and over-the-air updates, are standard across the global auto and transit industries, not unique to Chinese manufacturers.\n\nIndeed, any modern vehicle with internet connectivity might in theory be accessed remotely, whether made in Beijing, Detroit, or Tokyo. Critics in China have taken to global media to warn that U.S. bans could backfire by raising costs and supply chain challenges for American automakers dependent on global components.\n\nBut for many U.S. national security experts, the defining issue isn’t simply connectivity but control. If a foreign company can access the mission-critical systems of vehicles running on public streets — or the energy grids, solar inverters, or AI systems that undergird modern life — then that access becomes a lever that adversaries could exploit during crises.\n\nThe Australian episode has already spurred official reviews of every Yutong model in service. Transport Canberra officials insist there is no immediate operational concern based on current investigations, and that local buses are updated via physical service centers rather than remote connectivity.\n\nBut the warning’s broader resonance has rippled through capitals from London to Canberra, Oslo to Washington: as nations electrify their transit fleets and embrace connected vehicles, they must also reckon with who controls that connectedness.\n\nAnd for American lawmakers who warned loudly (and, in the eyes of some, prematurely) that Chinese technology on wheels isn’t just another import, this moment may well feel like a long-anticipated reckoning.",

    "description": "Morgan Stanley identifies AI adoption, energy trends, societal shifts, and deglobalization as key market drivers in 2026.",
    "fullText": "There are four major themes that will drive markets in 2026, Morgan Stanley says: A multipolar world, technology diffusion, societal shifts, and the future of energy.\n\nLet's get into each, starting with the concept of a multipolar world. For Morgan Stanley, the world is becoming less globalized as governments become more protectionist.\n\n\"It's clear that policymakers globally are implementing policies that will speed up the devolution of the globalization that marked much of the post-Cold War period,\" said Stephen C Byrd, an equity strategist at the bank, in a client note on Thursday. \"Said more simply, policymakers are keen to promote their visions of national and economic security through less open commerce and more local control of supply chains and key technologies.\"\n\nSecond, the bank thinks AI will begin to be adopted more broadly by businesses, helping them boost profits. Stocks will be judged on whether their businesses are incorporating AI enough, MS said.\n\nThird, energy demand has turned a corner thanks to the AI infrastructure buildout. While demand for energy has fallen over the last couple of decades, it's now surging to all-time highs.\n\n\"We expect total US energy consumption to rise 10% over the next decade, reversing decades of declines; by 2030, it should eclipse the prior peak, set in 2007,\" Byrd wrote.\n\nFinally, societal shifts are happening in things like work (thanks to AI), and aging and longevity.\n\n\"We see multiple trends driving broad societal impacts around the world, with effects felt across a surprisingly wide range of industries,\" Byrd wrote. \"The ripple effects of AI-driven employment disruption/evolution, an aging population, changing consumer preferences, the drive for healthy longevity, and challenging demographics across many geographies will continue to matter for governments, economies, and corporates.\"\n\nAs a way to play these trends, the bank highlighted 14 US stocks that its analysts have an \"overweight\" rating on.
