    "description": "Zelenskyy said his country's 1,000 daily interceptor drones are \"still not enough,\" even at a 2:1 manufacturing ratio against Russia's Shaheds.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Thursday that Russia is building roughly 500 Iranian-designed drones a day.\n\nHis comments at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, are a rare public assessment from Ukrainian leaders about Russia's drone-making capacity and provide some insight into how Kyiv sees the balance of power in its long-range drone fight.\n\nZelenskyy has said repeatedly that Ukraine is building 1,000 interceptor drones — small quadcopters designed to counter other flying drones — every day.\n\n\"We produce them at about 1,000 a day. We really produce them, but it's not enough. It's still not enough,\" he told his audience in Davos. \"Russia has 500, about 500 drones, Iranian drones, each day, and dozens of missiles, ballistic missiles.\"\n\nIranian drones refer to Russia's Geran family of loitering munitions, which are mostly based on the Iranian Shahed, a delta-wing drone designed to carry explosive warheads at long range. Because their designs are so closely related, Ukrainians often use their names interchangeably.\n\nThese drones have been a major pain point for Ukraine, which is frequently bombarded by hundreds of Gerans and decoy drones at a time from across Russia's border.\n\nLast week, Ukraine's commander in chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said that Russia is likely aiming to scale up its drone-making capacity to 1,000 Gerans per day.\n\nHe added that Russia is already building 404 Shaheds of \"various types\" per day.\n\nZelenskyy's latest comment also provides clues about the battlefield conditions for Ukraine's new type of air defense with interceptor drones.\n\nThe Ukrainian president's figures imply that his country is fielding twice as many interceptors as Russia's Shaheds, but that a 2:1 ratio isn't sufficient to protect his country's skies.\n\nFor now, interceptor drones in Ukraine are mostly controlled by human pilots, who have the difficult task of maneuvering lightweight quadcopters — sometimes in strong winds or poor weather — to chase down a flying target at speeds of over 100 mph in the vast sky.\n\nEarlier this week, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine also risks running short of interceptor drone pilots and told his government to prioritize recruiting and training more of them.\n\nThe Kremlin has been increasingly developing versions of Gerans with new features, such as jet engines to replace propellers or additional cameras to help the drone avoid interceptors.\n\nMore recently, Ukraine said Russia has deployed a new type of turbojet Geran that mirrors Iran's Karrar attack drone. Unlike the Shahed, it features a more conventional aircraft design,",

    "fullText": "Jan 22 (Reuters) - General Motors is moving production of a China-built Buick SUV to the U.S., ​its latest move to expand U.S. factory work in the ‌wake of the Trump administration’s tariffs.\n\nThe Detroit automaker said Thursday it is ending China production ‌of the Buick Envision, a midsize SUV that it has been importing to the U.S. for nearly a decade. GM will instead build the next generation of the vehicle at its assembly plant in the Kansas City area ⁠starting in 2028.\n\n“This decision further ‌strengthens GM’s domestic manufacturing footprint and supports U.S. jobs,” the automaker said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nGM has shipped ‍the Envision to the U.S. since 2017 as its only Chinese import. GM has faced a 25% tariff on the vehicles since 2018, and did not win ​an exemption from the tariff during the first Trump administration.\n\nThe Envision ‌became a target for critics of Chinese-made goods, including leaders of the United Auto Workers union and members in key political swing states such as Michigan and Ohio.\n\nTariffs on vehicles imported from China increased last year amid a trade war between Washington and Beijing.\n\nLast year, GM announced it would ⁠bring production of the Chevrolet Equinox SUV ​to the same Kansas City-area plant, from ​a factory in Mexico. GM recently began production of the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt out of the plant for a limited run.\n\nWhen ‍production of the ⁠Bolt ends, GM will convert the plant to make only combustion-engine vehicles. Equinox production will start in 2027, GM said.\n\nGM is also ⁠moving production of the Chevy Blazer to Spring Hill, Tennessee, from Mexico in 2027.",

    "fullText": "The Newbridge Cutlery Company said today it will stop production of silver-plated cutlery and tableware at its factory in Newbridge in Co Kildare.\n\nThe factory, which employs 11 people, will officially cease operations on 10 April.\n\nFounded in 1934, the company said that given its long and proud heritage in the industry the decision to close the factory was an extremely difficult decision and came after a comprehensive strategic review of the loss-making cutlery business.\n\nThe company said the closure of the factory will not affect the broader Newbridge Silverware business which will continue to operate as normal.\n\nThis includes the Newbridge Visitor Centre in Newbridge, its six standalone stores and the 250 local stockists of Newbridge Silverware around the country.\n\nA consultation process with impacted workers is underway, the company said.\n\nIn a statement, the Newbridge Cutlery Company said today's decision follows several years of falling sales due to reduced demand for silver-plated tableware such as cutlery driven by changing tastes and dining habits at home and across the hospitality sector.\n\n\"Traditional purchases like silver cutlery canteens for wedding gifts have also become increasingly rare. This has resulted in a steady decline in sales and demand for this product,\" the company said.\n\nThe Newbridge Cutlery Company opened as a local co-operative in 1934 with a view to leveraging skills from the former military barracks to craft silver-plated tableware for the Irish market. In the 1990s the company expanded into the jewellery and homeware market which operates under the Newbridge Silverware brand.\n\n\"We have taken the difficult decision to cease operations at our cutlery factory from mid-April. Since 1934, we have built a long and proud history in silver cutlery and tableware manufacturing and have earned a reputation as a centre of excellence in the industry. Today's announcement reflects sustained changes in market demand, and it is with deep regret that we are ceasing operations,\" Martin Kilduff, Operations Director at The Newbridge Cutlery Company, said.\n\nHe said the decline of silver cutlery manufacturing is not unique to Ireland and has been a long-term, Europe-wide trend in line with changing consumer tastes.\n\n\"In addition to this, over the past 12 months, the price of silver bullion has risen by approximately 150%. Absorbing an increase of this magnitude is not feasible without significantly impacting retail pricing. This is a challenge currently being faced across the entire industry,\" he said.\n\n\"We fully understand the impact this decision will have on those craftsmen and women who maintained the tradition of crafting silver plated tableware in Newbridge for generations,\" Mr Kilduff said.\n\n\"We are committed to a meaningful consultation process and to supporting affected employees through clear communication, engagement with their representatives, and access to appropriate supports during this time,\" he added.",

    "description": "A plush toy horse designed as a cheerful Chinese New Year mascot has galloped into unexpected popularity — with an ironic twist.",
    "fullText": "A plush toy horse designed as a cheerful Chinese New Year mascot has galloped into unexpected popularity — with an ironic twist.\n\nCreated for the upcoming Year of the Horse in the Chinese zodiac, it was originally meant to wear an upturned smile. Instead, due to a production error at a factory in Yiwu, Zhejiang province — widely known as the world's capital of small commodities — the toy left the assembly line with its mouth stitched into a distinct, down-turned pout.\n\n\"It was simply a worker's mistake — the mouth was sewn upside down,\" factory owner Zhang Huoqing said in an interview on Friday.\n\nThe story began when a social media user in Hangzhou, the provincial capital, received the flawed toy and contacted customer service to request a replacement. After posting photos of its melancholic expression online, the plush unexpectedly surged to fame.\n\nNetizens quickly dubbed it the \"cry-cry horse\", and demand for the \"accidental edition\" flooded in. By Sunday, the hashtag #YiwuCryCry-HorseGoneViral had garnered about 100 million views on the social media platform Sina Weibo.\n\nThe toy's forlorn pout, paired with determined eyes, was swiftly embraced as a \"cyber mouthpiece\" for a generation of office workers. It embodies a collective sentiment of maintaining outward composure while enduring internal pressure — a feeling often described by the popular term \"cattle-and-horse\", a euphemism for being overworked.\n\n\"It's a true depiction of the 'cattle-and-horse' mindset,\" one user wrote. Another added, \"It's quite adorable and looks really stubborn. For the Year of the Horse, let's make it a determined and hardworking one.\"\n\nWang Bin, a professor of social media communication at Renmin University of China, interpreted the trend as a psychological response to widespread social fatigue. He said the plush toy functions as an emotional anchor for consumers grappling with uncertainty and daily pressures.\n\n\"Everyone feels exhausted and faces many uncertainties about the future,\" Wang said, adding that the toy serves as a form of emotional comfort that people can buy.\n\nThe factory in Yiwu seized the moment with remarkable speed, pivoting production almost overnight. The number of assembly lines dedicated to the toy expanded from two to more than 10, with workers now meticulously trained to replicate the signature \"sad\" mouth — the very flaw they had once been instructed to avoid.\n\nThe identity of the original artisan responsible for the error remains unknown. Zhang said the company would award a bonus to the entire production team in recognition of their role in the toy's unexpected success.\n\nDespite the frenzy, the company has pledged to keep the retail price fixed at 25 yuan ($3.5).\n\nIts rapid rise to popularity underscores a shifting industrial paradigm whereby manufacturers increasingly prioritize consumer feedback, turning sentiment into a key factor in new product launches, said Zhu Huasheng, a professor at Beijing Normal University who studies industrial clusters.\n\n\"The success is not just about supply chain agility,\" Zhu said. \"The internet-driven thinking of vendors played a major role.\"\n\nHe pointed to Yiwu — known as the \"world's supermarket\" — as a prime example of how online sentiment can now be translated almost instantly into physical products.\n\nFor decades, Yiwu has relied on flexible networks of small suppliers capable of rapid retooling and small-batch production. What has changed, Zhu said, is the addition of a digital layer. Social media and online platforms now provide real-time, high-resolution data on niche emotional trends, allowing factories to identify and validate new market signals almost overnight.\n\n\"Consumers, especially young people, are no longer passive buyers but active participants,\" he said.\"Their emotional expressions can directly shape what gets made.\"\n\nThe \"cry-cry horse\" illustrates this system in action. Yiwu's sprawling commercial complex, home to more than 75,000 wholesale booths, has long served as a bellwether for disposable consumer trends and a sourcing base for global bargain retailers.\n\nHowever, the toy industry remains notoriously fickle, and viral crazes often last only months. Zhu said manufacturers in Yiwu are keenly aware of the \"burst\" nature of internet trends. Their strategy centers on hyper-agile production — riding the wave at its peak and winding down quickly.\n\nLow per-unit costs help minimize financial risk, and the dense local supply network allows labor and materials to be swiftly redirected to other products. Ultimately, Zhu said, the strength of such hubs lies less in predicting a trend's longevity than in mastering the logistics of a short life cycle — maximizing returns within a narrow window before enthusiasm fades.",

    "description": "Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter spoke to Business Insider on how humanoid robots will take over the factory and when they'll come to our homes.",
    "fullText": "In a few years, factory employees at Hyundai's massive Georgia plant could be getting a new coworker.\n\nIt's about 200 pounds, six-feet, two-inches tall, has a four-hour battery life, and a face inspired by Disney's Pixar lamp, Luxor Jr.\n\nIts name is Atlas, an all-electric humanoid robot from Boston Dynamics, the Massachusetts-based company and maker of the four-legged inspection robot, Spot, and the mobile warehouse robot, Stretch.\n\nHyundai, which owns Boston Dynamics, unveiled the latest version of Atlas at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on January 5. During live demonstrations, Atlas was seen waving hello to its audience before moving car parts from one rack to another.\n\nThis is how the humanoid robot revolution starts, according to Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter.\n\n\"We're starting with the simpler stuff, which is parts sequencing,\" Playter said in an interview with Business Insider. Eventually, the tasks get more complex, and Atlas will be on the assembly line. Then, the CEO said, perhaps in five to 10 years' time, the robots will enter our homes.\n\nPlayter, an MIT alumn and aerospace engineer by training, has been at Boston Dynamics for more than 30 years and has seen the company change hands multiple times — first to Google, then to SoftBank, and now to Hyundai after the South Korean automaker acquired a majority stake in the robotics company five years ago.\n\nPlayter was appointed CEO in 2019. Since then, he has steered the company through its commercial launch of Spot, Atlas' transition from a hydraulics platform to an all-electric platform, and more recently, Boston Dynamics' partnership with Google DeepMind, Alphabet's AI research lab, to help build Atlas' \"brain.\"\n\nThe CEO spoke to Business Insider on the Atlas demonstration floor about how humanoid robots will transform the workplace before they take over our homes, the problems still to be solved before humanoids can work, and why Atlas looks like a Disney-inspired character.\n\nThe interview was edited for length and clarity.\n\nIs there a story behind Atlas' face?\n\nAbsolutely. A lot of the humanoid producers create what I would call scary, dystopian robot faces. It's like, oh my god, there's this black face. Is that a human shape? Why can't I see it? It's just scary.\n\nSo we tried to go the other way, and the shape is really driven from the Pixar lamp, the original friendly mechanism. We wanted to forecast that this is not a human. It is a machine — it's a friendly machine.\n\nIs this what you imagined the robot takeover looking like when you were at MIT about 40 years ago?\n\nI think it's what we dreamed about. But we've been doing humanoids since 2008. We've been doing this for a long time. But for us to be approaching a point where we're really thinking about commercializing the humanoid, I don't know that we expected that years ago. The turning point has been AI. It's really the enabler that lets a robot like this do a huge variety of tasks, which is what's needed to really make these generalizable.\n\nIs AI the main technological advancement that's transformed the robot?\n\nThere's a lot of hardware advancements as well. The early robots were hydraulic. These are all electric. This is our newest version that is going to be mass-produced. And it's designed for simplicity and cost. If you notice, there's a lot of similar joints and shapes on this robot — it's really built to be modular. There's only three different types of motors, which means we're going to be able to mass-produce them at scale and get the cost down. The joints all have 360-degree rotation, which is why you see these crazy inside-out yoga motion. And it's strong. This robot's going to be able to pick up 110 pounds.\n\nA few years ago, Aaron Saunders, the former CTO, talked about the bipedal form factor and how it's not the best for every task. That's why you have Stretch, for example, to carry boxes. Has that mentality shifted at Boston?\n\nI think we're still going to see lots of different morphologies for different applications. But one of the great things about humanoids is people are just fascinated by them, and they could be truly general-purpose. With two manipulators, you could basically pick up and put down almost anything that a person could do. You can go to almost any place that a person can go to.\n\nIs the tradeoff of tackling the technical challenges of doing a humanoid worth it compared to sticking with a robot like Stretch that can perform limited tasks but is already deployed?\n\nDefinitely, there's more complexity. This has 56 degrees of freedom. Stretch is going to work in warehouses. Humanoids could potentially work anywhere and eventually in our homes. So the generality of this shape is really what lends it power. It's the best robot we've ever built. It's the one we've built to be mass-producible right out of the gate. But there's still complexity that has to get solved. Part of that's in the AI. We've solved a lot of the hardware parts; now we need to go solve the AI problems.\n\nSo there's still something to solve between now and 2028 deployment.\n\nAbsolutely. What we've seen is that AI techniques allow us to get an unprecedented diversity of skills onto the robots quickly, but we really need to generalize that. If you're going to have a robot that's actually useful in the factory, it's got to do a hundred different tasks, not just one or two. And it's really the AI that's going to enable that. We also have to make that unprecedented reliability — 99.9% reliable. The AI is not quite there yet, but it's very promising.\n\nIs there a specific number of tasks Atlas needs to achieve that will make it ready to be shipped out?\n\nWe need to be able to bring a new task to bear in a day or two. And that's because, I think in a factory, there's literally hundreds of tasks, and the tasks evolve. So yeah, every 24 or 48 hours to get a new task onto a robot.\n\nHow do you imagine Atlas transforming the workplace, starting with the factory?\n\nThere's a lot of logistics work that has to be done in an automotive factory — a huge variety of pick-and-place tasks to get all the pieces of the car to the line. Atlas is going to start in that sequencing — it's called parts sequencing. It's really a logistics task. And as the capabilities get more sophisticated, we're going to eventually start entering assembly tasks. We're going to deal with heavy lifting, repeatable tasks that tend to wear people out. That's kind of what we're doing with Stretch, which is unloading trailing. The people who used to unload trailers now operate the robot. We see the same thing happening in factories. Factory workers are going to be the trainers of these new technologies.\n\nCan the workers interact with the robots and talk to them?\n\nYes. We have demonstrations of some of these behaviors where we just tell the robot, \"Empty out this bin of parts,\" and it'll go do that. That is all part of the package, and we really want to just make it a seamless interaction.\n\nIs there a list of tasks you believe Atlas will be best for and ones that Atlas will avoid?\n\nWe've analyzed all the jobs that have to occur in an automotive factory. We're starting with the simpler stuff, which is parts sequencing. And then above that, you have gradations of complexity. Do you have to get inside the car to fit something? Do you have to do a close-tolerant fit? Do you have to deal with flexible wiring harness? Those things are more complex, and it's going to take more time to bring to bear. So, we're starting with the simple stuff, and then it'll grow over time.\n\nThere's a lot of ambivalence around robots taking over our jobs. Has Boston Dynamics done an analysis of how many jobs one Atlas can actually replace or take on?\n\nLet me get to the ambivalence. There's a feeling of a little anxiety around robots in general. What we're actually finding when we bring robots into the workplace is that people end up enjoying interacting with the robots.\n\nSome of the people who used to unload trailers now operate Stretch. They just got upskilled. They like their job more now that Stretch is doing the heavy-lifting. And I think there's a great potential with AI-powered robots that anybody can interact with them and train them. It will not require an advanced engineering degree, and that essentially opens up the productivity enhancements to regular workers. I think it's going to be a symbiosis.\n\nSo, less about human replacement?\n\nI think so. We're going to build a whole new industry. There's going to be a lot of jobs created just building, maintaining, deploying, and training robots.\n\nAnd if you've paid attention to demographic trends worldwide, population has decreased everywhere. If we're going to bring manufacturing back to the United States, we have to increase productivity. And I think robotics is a way to increase the productivity of our workforce.\n\nSo Boston Dynamics doesn't have a metric or ratio — like, one Atlas robot can do the job of five humans?\n\nI think it depends totally on the task. And so we don't have that metric yet. The way we measure that in the Stretch is it's all about case pick rate: How many boxes can you pick per hour, and how does that compare to the humans that did that job? And we pretty much have to at least match that. In some cases, we can exceed it, but in some cases, people are still better because the robots aren't quite smarter.\n\nHow do you pitch companies on Atlas? Do you tell them they can save X amount of money?\n\nWe have experience doing this with Spot. Companies typically want to see a return on investment in around two to three years.\n\nWe talk a lot about AI talent wars. Is it competitive for Boston Dynamics?\n\nHoly, it's crazy. We need the same AI talent that Meta and Google and Nvidia are all hiring, so it's extremely competitive. The thing we have that nobody else has, which is important for the top talent, is really exciting robots.\n\nDo you have Atlas running around in your home right now for testing?\n\nNo, we have it in the lab. We had Spots at home. During COVID, everybody had to go home, and our developers just took the robots home with them. We probably paid for the damage to the house when they ran into the walls.\n\nHa, the real test case. Well, the goal with Atlas is to bring them home, too, right?\n\nEventually. We see industrial as the first stepping stone for three reasons.\n\nCost. These first robots are going to be a little bit too expensive for consumer level. Safety. Factories are a safer environment. You can control it a little bit more than the home. And then capabilities.\n\nAt home, you've got the worst of all worlds. It has to be the cheapest, it has to be the most safe, and it's the most complex environment.\n\nWe're going to get to home, I'd say, in five to 10 years. The next five years we're really focusing on industrial applications.\n\nIs there something your competitors don't understand about deploying humanoid robots?\n\nI think they understand it just fine. They're just playing a slightly different game.\n\nThis is a very expensive business to be in. It takes billions of dollars of investment to sort of get this technology to where it needs to be. If you're going to play that game, you got to have the largest possible market. So, of course, they're saying they're going to go home. It's the large end market, but I just think that's a mistake.",

    "title": "Suspended Ford Worker Who Was Flipped Off By Trump Made So Much Money On GoFundMe He Paused Donations",
    "description": "Two six-figure crowdfunding campaigns saw thousands of individual donations for the Ford factory worker.",
    "fullText": "President Trump giving the middle-finger to a Ford employee who apparently calls it like he sees it seems to be the best thing that has ever happened to him — financially at least. TJ Sabula, a 40-year old United Auto Workers Local 600 line worker, was quickly suspended with pay by Ford after heckling the President while he was visiting one of its factories in Michigan (the President, in turn, flipped him the bird and apparently mouthed \"F**k you.\") But, soon after, a pair of GoFundMe pages were set up for Sabula and they took off like wildfire.\n\nAs of mid-morning on January 15, the pair of campaigns for Sabula have raised $811,010 from nearly 35,000 separate donations. Sabula, seeming to be a stand-up guy, actually decided to stop accepting donations, indicating he and his family had more than enough.\n\nIn an update on one of the pages, Sabula wrote, \"We greatly appreciate the outpouring of support! At this time we are closing donations to this campaign and encourage you to look for other causes and organizations to support. We appreciate every single donation, comment, share, and sign of support!\" The other page had a similar message and said it was also closing donations. I'm not sure I'm big enough to ever stop taking free money, but good for him.\n\nOf course, Trump didn't just pick a random guy out of the crowd to cuss out, though it wouldn't be that surprising. Sabula reportedly called Trump a \"pedophile protector\" during his visit to the Michigan F-150 factory. The Department of Justice faces criticisms as to the speed it has released the Epstein files–along with the redactions being made to the documents–which must be made public in compliance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act.\n\nIn any case, as we previously reported, Trump's White House didn't try to cover up or downplay what the President did, instead telling the Washington Post that \"A lunatic was wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage, and the President gave an appropriate and unambiguous response.\"\n\nSabula told The Post that he has \"no regrets whatsoever,\" though he did add that he feels concerned about the future of his job and believes he has been \"targeted for political retribution\" for \"embarrassing Trump in front of his friends.\"\n\nIt's still unclear what Sabula's future with Ford will be, but at the very least the $800,000+ he's gotten from GoFundMe will help lighten the blow. On top of that, he's got the backing of the UAW. The union posted this on its website:\n\nThe autoworker at the Dearborn Truck Plant is a proud member of a strong and fighting union —the UAW. He believes in freedom of speech, a principle we wholeheartedly embrace, and we stand with our membership in protecting their voice on the job.\n\nThe UAW will ensure that our member receives the full protection of all negotiated contract language safeguarding his job and his rights as a union member. Workers should never be subjected to vulgar language or behavior by anyone—including the President of the United States.\n\nThat's certainly the type of union representation we all deserve.\n\nSabula has also received support from U.S. Rep Rashida Tlaib of Detroit, who represents Detroit, calling him a \"national hero,\" according to the Detroit Free Press. Former U.S. Secretary of Transportation and fellow Michigander Pete Buttigieg has also voiced his support.\n\nNot everyone was on board, though, including Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford, who earlier in the visit said meeting the president was \"the experience of a lifetime.\"\n\n\"Discipline is in the hands of the organization. It's unfortunate and 99% of the employees in the plant were great and I was embarrassed because we're the host. But that was six seconds out of an hour tour and the tour went great.\"\n\nCrowdfunding campaigns can often get people all riled up about someone being rewarded for \"bad behavior\": In early 2025, a woman in Minnesota was caught calling a child a racist slur on a playground and then made over $800,000 on GoFundMe-alike site GiveSendGo, according to NBC News. That woman was charged with three counts of disorderly conduct by the City of Rochester, with a trial set to begin in August 2026, ABC 6 News reports.\n\nWant more like this?

    "fullText": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company just gave the AI trade a fresh boost.\n\nThe chipmaker reported fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, blowing past analyst estimates on multiple metrics. It also reported a record 35% quarterly profit, sending TSMC stock soaring as investors cheered the latest indicator that AI demand is still running hot.\n\nThe end of 2025 saw rising doubts about the sustainability of the market's top trade, and investor fatigue over relentless AI infrastructure spending. But TSMC's earnings smash and record profit looks to have revived the AI trade as investors get ready for Big Tech earnings in the coming weeks.\n\nTSMC reported that revenue increased 20% on a year-over-year basis in the quarter, while both net income and diluted earnings-per-share surged more than 35%.\n\n\"Our business in the fourth quarter was supported by strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies,\" said TSMC CFO and senior VP Wendell Huang. \"Moving into first quarter 2026, we expect our business to be supported by continued strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies.\"\n\nThe company also revealed that its capital spending could rise by as much as 37% to $56 billion this year, and it is expected to rise even more over the coming two years. Analysts had only expected $46 billion for this year.\n\nThis news quickly sent AI chip stocks soaring in anticipation of for higher demand. The sector's top premarket moves are as follows:\n\nThe news proved particularly bullish for ASML stock, which saw its market cap surge past $500 billion on Thursday after TSMC posted its big spending forecast.\n\nThe high spending forecast makes it clear that TSMC, considered the market's leader in the AI chip production space, expects demand to remain high not just in 2026 but over the upcoming three year period. As the company is seen as a bellwether for its industry, Wall Street will likely take it as an indicator that the AI trade is as strong as ever.",

    "description": "Jose Fernando Partida was trapped for five hours while rescuers worked to free him",
    "fullText": "An Arizona man died after he was involved in an industrial accident at his workplace.\n\nJose Fernando Partida, 57, was cleaning the inside of a chemical mixer at at Gowan Milling LLC in Yuma when tragedy struck. The machine he was in turned on as a co-worker climbed inside to assist with the cleaning, and although they managed to escape, Partida wasn’t so lucky, according to his son Omar.\n\nWorkers managed to shut the machine’s power off instantly, Rural Metro Fire said, but the complex rescue operation took over five hours. Rescuers had to wear hazmat equipment due to the chemical exposure. Partida would suffered several serious injuries and died a week later.\n\n“The sad thing is the time that he was there and that he was begging for help,” Omar told AZFamily. “I was imagining all the pain that he was passed through and all that stuff. I imagine it’s just to be there for five hours and hold all the pain. I don’t think my dad deserved all that.”\n\nOmar told AZFamily that he received a call that there'd been an accident, but he assumed it was something minor. Instead, he learned his father was trapped inside a piece of heavy equipment.\n\nPartida was hospitalized for a week after the incident. He was unconscious for much of it and had endured broken ribs, a broken leg, and bruising throughout his body. He died over the weekend.\n\nThe Yuma County Sheriff's Office and the Industrial Commission of Arizona said the incident is being investigated. It could take up to five months to complete, AZFamily reports.\n\nOmar said his father was always there for him and his family.\n\n“He always was trying to help us and anything that we had the problems, he was there,” he added. “And he always have an answer for me. Now that he’s not here, it’s like, I don’t know. It’s like, ‘cause it was just me, my sister and him.”\n\n“He always called me to let me know about soccer and about football,” Omar said.\n\nOmar's family has launched a GoFundMe to help with medical and funeral costs. At the time of writing, it has raised over $5,000 towards its target of $10,000.\n\n“Jose was a joyful, loving man who brought people together. He loved life, music, dancing, soccer, and above all, his family. He leaves behind his devoted wife Lupe and two children, Omar and Allison, whom he loved tremendously,” the GoFundMe states.\n\nGowan Milling LLC issued the following statement following the incident:\n\n\"A Gowan Milling employee was injured during an incident on January 4 at our Yuma, Arizona production facility,” a statement from Gowan Milling LLC to AZFamily read.\n\n“We immediately enacted our emergency response protocol upon learning of this employee’s injury, including calling emergency medical professionals and other first responders. Emergency responders provided medical care to our employee on the scene and transported him to the hospital by ambulance.”\n\nIt continued: “We also worked closely with first responders to secure the area surrounding the incident. Unfortunately, the employee passed away in the hospital due to his injuries on January 10. We are deeply saddened by the loss of our employee, and our thoughts and most sincere sympathies are extended to his family at this time. The safety of our employees is our first priority, and we are conducting an investigation into this incident. We also are continuing to cooperate with local law enforcement and regulatory agencies\"",

    "description": "With US federal EV incentives gone, Tesla gets back to dominating the US market. It's all about volume and EV manufacturing scale.",
    "fullText": "Federal incentives for electric vehicles disappeared at the end of the third quarter, leaving the US market to survive on its own merits.\n\nSo, how did companies perform in this new, realistic environment?\n\nCox Automotive, an industry data provider, has just released EV sales estimates for the fourth quarter on Tuesday, and the numbers reveal which companies thrive and which struggle without government assistance.\n\nTesla once again dominates the EV market in the US. Its market share surged to 59% in Q4, up from 41% in the previous quarter, Cox data shows.\n\nOne major reason is that EV companies in the US now have to make the numbers work without government help. A significant part of the equation is volume.\n\nDespite a decline in sales recently, Tesla still sold 138,000 EVs in the US during the fourth quarter. That type of volume helps the company maintain relatively low prices while still making money.\n\nMost rivals don't have that volume, and their EV manufacturing operations just aren't as efficient as Tesla's because they still make other types of cars, which have way more parts than EVs. This can make them more expensive to manufacture and can lead to big losses.\n\n\"In the volume-driven business of automotive manufacturing, low volume is the enemy; EV profitability remains a distant dream for nearly every automaker,\" Cox warned last year as federal incentives ended.\n\nFord's EV market share was measly 6% in the fourth quarter, while Rivian's stood at just 4%.\n\nGeneral Motors is performing somewhat better, with a market share of over 10%. Even here, the math just doesn't add up. General Motors took $6 billion in fourth-quarter charges tied to scaling back EV plans in the US.\n\nIn December, Ford abandoned large EVs because it couldn't make a profit on them. The company took a $20 billion write-down on its failing EV business. Rivian still loses a lot of money, although its cheaper R2 EV might improve things later this year.\n\nIn July, Mercedes stopped taking EV orders in the US. Stellantis recently shelved some of its EV plans, along with Porsche and Honda. Even Ferrari, which has juicy profit margins, dialed down its EV plans.\n\nIf EV operations can't reach high-volume scale, they risk constantly losing money. At some point, they have to stop the bleeding. When incentives ended in the US, many players decided to give up.\n\nTesla remains the exception in the US. It's proving that, in this industry, volume equals survival.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "With Mecum Kissimmee in full swing, it’s a good time to take a closer look at the factory options that turned performance machines into auction record holders. When these cars were new, they weren’t conceived ... Read more",
    "fullText": "With Mecum Kissimmee in full swing, it’s a good time to take a closer look at the factory options that turned performance machines into auction record holders.\n\nWhen these cars were new, they weren’t conceived as future collectibles. They were production vehicles that you could walk into a dealership and order by checking boxes on a form. Many of these options were skipped simply because the average buyer didn’t feel they needed the extra performance for the added cost, and no one was thinking about how those decisions would matter decades later.\n\nWhat follows isn’t an exhaustive list. It’s a cross-section of factory options and vehicles, shaped in part by what we could actually find source photos for. Some of the rarest configurations simply don’t have usable images available, so they aren’t represented here.\n\nDecades later, those same choices are why these cars now sit at the very top of the collector market.\n\nAmong American muscle cars, few factory option combinations have proven more valuable than the pairing of 426 Hemi power and a convertible body, particularly at the end of the muscle car era.\n\nFor 1971, the final year of Hemi ’Cuda production, Plymouth built just 12 Hemi ’Cuda Convertibles. That exceptionally low production figure is the primary driver of the model’s value today.\n\nSurvivorship is extremely limited, and documentation is critical. Cars retaining their original matching-numbers 426/425 HP Hemi engines, factory drivetrains, and verified build data occupy the top tier of the collector market. Differences such as automatic versus manual transmission, axle packages, and production sequence can have a measurable impact on value among the small number of known examples.\n\nA documented 1971 Hemi ’Cuda Convertible currently being offered at Mecum Kissimmee 2026 illustrates how a single factory option—combining the Hemi engine with a convertible body—now places these cars among the most valuable American muscle cars ever built.\n\nLike the other vehicles featured here, the Hemi ’Cuda Convertible’s status is not the result of racing success or aftermarket modification. Its value is defined by a factory-approved option that was technically available, rarely chosen, and never repeated.\n\nIn the late 1960s, General Motors officially limited Camaro engine displacement to 400 cubic inches. Dealers found a workaround through the Central Office Production Order (COPO) system, which allowed special-purpose vehicles to bypass standard restrictions.\n\nThrough COPO, select Camaros could be ordered with 427-cubic-inch V8s. Most received iron-block engines, but just 69 were fitted with the all-aluminum ZL1, an engine derived from Chevrolet’s Can-Am racing program. The ZL1 dramatically reduced weight while delivering immense power, making it one of the most extreme factory engine options ever installed in a street car.\n\nThat simple engine choice is what elevates documented COPO ZL1 Camaros into seven-figure territory today.\n\nThe Judge was already a bold performance and appearance package, but pairing it with a convertible body style created one of the rarest factory GTO configurations Pontiac ever offered.\n\nOnly 168 GTO Judge Convertibles were built for the 1970 model year. While no exotic engine separates these cars mechanically, the Judge package itself was a defining factory option, and combining it with an open body proved unpopular when new.\n\nThat low take rate is what drives their value today.\n\nDodge produced 963 Challenger R/T Convertibles in 1970. Of those, just five were ordered with the 426 Street Hemi and a four-speed manual transmission.\n\nThe Hemi was a fully factory-approved engine option, but its high cost and demanding nature discouraged most buyers, particularly in a convertible. Survivorship is exceptionally low, and the rarity of that option combination is what pushes these cars into million-dollar territory.\n\nBuilt to homologate aerodynamic components for NASCAR competition, the Superbird was extreme even by muscle-car standards. Approximately 1,920 were produced, most equipped with the 440 Magnum V8.\n\nOnly roughly 135–170 were ordered with the optional 426 Hemi, a costly upgrade few buyers selected at the time. Today, that single factory engine option often separates six-figure Superbirds from seven-figure examples.\n\nDodge built 503 Charger Daytonas, the majority powered by the 440 Magnum. Only about 70 left the factory with the 426 Hemi, making them among the rarest American muscle cars ever produced.\n\nThe combination of radical aerodynamics and the Hemi engine created a dominant race car and one of the most valuable factory option packages of the era.\n\nAuction Prices: Multiple sales in the multi-million-dollar range\n\nWhen the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL debuted in 1954, it was already revolutionary. A small number of buyers, however, were allowed to order the Leichtmetallausführung, or Light Metal Version.\n\nThis factory option replaced the standard steel body panels with aluminum and added competition-oriented components. The option carried a substantial price premium when new, and fewer than 30 alloy-bodied Gullwings were produced.\n\nToday, documented factory alloy examples sell for millions more than standard steel-bodied cars.\n\nAuction Prices: Can exceed $3 million\n\nThe L88 was one of the most extreme factory engine options ever offered in a production Corvette. Introduced in 1967 and available through 1969, the option spanned the final year of the C2 and the early C3 generation, with the engine itself—rather than the body style—being the defining factor.\n\nOfficially rated at 430 horsepower, the aluminum-head 427-cubic-inch V-8 was intentionally underrated. Real-world output was significantly higher, but Chevrolet paired the L88 with restrictive ordering requirements that ensured only informed buyers selected it.\n\nChoosing RPO L88 automatically bundled heavy-duty suspension and cooling components while deleting common comfort features such as a radio and heater. The result was a Corvette that prioritized performance over usability, reinforcing the engine’s competition-focused intent.\n\nOriginality and documentation are critical to value, as the L88’s purpose-built nature makes correct components and factory verification especially important. Well-documented examples, whether late-C2 or early-C3, consistently reside at the top of the Corvette market.\n\nLike the other vehicles featured here, the L88 Corvette’s status is defined by a factory-approved option that was technically available, rarely chosen, and never intended for casual ownership. That single engine decision is what now places these cars firmly in multi-million-dollar territory.\n\nThe L89 was a factory option that spanned two Corvette generations, appearing in the final year of the C2 and the first year of the C3. Rather than being tied to a single body style, the option itself was the defining factor.\n\nRPO L89 paired Chevrolet’s 427-cubic-inch big-block with aluminum cylinder heads, reducing weight while preserving street usability. It could be ordered with several 427 variants, making it a flexible but rarely selected performance upgrade.\n\nIn total, fewer than 850 Corvettes are believed to have been equipped with the L89 option across both model years. While not every example commands seven figures, the most original, well-documented cars—regardless of generation—have crossed the million-dollar mark at auction.\n\nAs with the other vehicles featured here, it is the factory-approved option, not the body style alone, that defines long-term value.\n\nAuction Prices: Approaching or exceeding $1 million\n\nOffered for just one year, RPO ZR2 was a factory competition package built around the high-revving LT1 small-block V8. It bundled heavy-duty suspension, upgraded cooling, racing-focused driveline components, and deleted common comfort features.\n\nOnly 12 ZR2 Corvettes were built, making it one of the rarest factory Corvette options ever offered.\n\nNone of these cars became million-dollar collectibles by accident. In every case, the leap in value traces back to factory-approved options that were available, yet rarely chosen.\n\nThese were not dealer modifications or one-off prototypes. They were decisions made on order forms, often dismissed as unnecessary at the time. Decades later, those same decisions define the top of the collector market.\n\nSometimes, the most valuable performance upgrade isn’t horsepower alone—it’s the option almost no one ordered.",

    "description": "KeyBanc analyst John Vinh upgraded Intel to Overweight from Sector Weight.",
    "fullText": "Intel (INTC) stock climbed more than 5% Tuesday as investment firm KeyBanc upgraded shares to Overweight from Sector Weight, citing the chipmaker’s advances in its manufacturing business and demand for its chips from AI data centers.\n\nAnalyst John Vinh said in a note to clients Tuesday that Big Tech’s demand for chips and servers to power AI is leading to higher sales of Intel’s CPUs — central processing units, or more traditional computer chips used alongside AI chips such as Nvidia's (NVDA) GPUs to train and run artificial intelligence models. Vinh said his supply chain checks show Intel is “almost sold out for the year” in data center server CPUs and may raise prices on the chips.\n\nVinh also cited “significant progress\" in Intel's manufacturing business.\n\nIntel has worked to revive its manufacturing arm, Intel Foundry Services (IFS), just as its chips have lost ground to AMD (AMD) and Arm (ARM). The company has fallen into a vicious cycle: Manufacturing stumbles hurt the competitiveness of its chips, and softer chip sales left its factories underutilized, which only made the manufacturing turnaround harder. Early reported tests of Intel's latest manufacturing process, 18A, by Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO) failed to result in major deals for Intel.\n\nBut a new CEO, investments from the US government and Nvidia, and the so-far successful launch of PC chips made with 18A have buoyed investor confidence in Intel’s ability to right the ship.\n\nIn what would be a major boost for IFS, Vinh said his supply chain checks in Asia indicate that Intel has signed Apple (AAPL) as a customer to use its next-generation manufacturing 18A-P process to make low-end PC chips for its Macs and iPads. In semiconductor terms, Intel's recently launched 18A process node represents the latest generation of its chip fabrication technology, and 18A-P is an advanced, upcoming version of that node.\n\nThe potential Apple deal was first predicted by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo in late November, sending Intel shares soaring. Vinh called the rumored partnership Intel’s “first big whale design win.”\n\nThe KeyBanc analyst also said he believes the two tech firms are in discussions for Apple to use Intel’s upcoming process, 14A, to make low-end chips for iPhones in 2029.\n\nIntel and Apple did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment on the possible deals.\n\nMeanwhile, Vinh said 18A’s improving yield — the percentage of chips that a manufacturer produces from a silicon wafer that function correctly — is “enough to convince us it could credibly be the #2 foundry supplier in the industry ahead of Samsung.” The chip manufacturing industry has just three large-scale players: the leading, Taiwan-based TSMC (TSM), Korea’s Samsung (005930.KS), and US-based Intel.",

    "fullText": "The higher spending on AI chips is going to be a tailwind for TSMC stock in 2026.\n\nIts earnings are likely to grow at a faster pace than Wall Street's expectations this year.\n\nTSMC's attractive valuation and strong earnings potential suggest that it could soar nicely.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\n\nThe S&P 500 has been in a bull market for more than three years now, entering this territory in October 2022, and the good news is that the index is expected to sustain its rally in 2026 as well.\n\nAfter recording three consecutive years of double-digit gains, a feat that the index has achieved five times since it came into existence in 1957, Wall Street is looking forward to another year of robust growth in the S&P 500. Deutsche Bank, for instance, expects the S&P 500 to hit 8,000 points by the end of 2026, suggesting potential gains of 15% from current levels.\n\nAdditionally, financial services firm Carson Group's chief market strategist Ryan Detrick points out that once a bull market is three years old, it tends to stretch up to eight years on average, citing data going back to 1950. All this indicates that 2026 could turn out to be another good year for the stock market, and artificial intelligence (AI) is set to play a key role in driving more gains this year.\n\nJPMorgan points out that strong capital spending and earnings growth fueled by AI are going to be a catalyst for stocks in 2026. That's why now is a good time to take a closer look at a key company that's playing a central role in driving AI adoption -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) -- before the stock market heads higher in the new year.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the world's largest semiconductor foundry, manufacturing chips for all the leading chip designers and consumer electronics companies. That explains why it has been growing at a healthy pace in the past couple of years. TSMC's share of the foundry market stood at an incredible 72% in the third quarter of 2025, according to Counterpoint Research. Its fabrication plants that produce advanced chips for customers, such as Nvidia, Qualcomm, Broadcom, Apple, Sony, Advanced Micro Devices, and others, are reportedly running at full capacity.\n\nThis isn't surprising as the cutting-edge nature of TSMC's advanced manufacturing nodes means that chip designers are able to pack in more transistors into a smaller area on chips fabricated by the Taiwan-based giant. As a result, TSMC-made chips are both powerful and power-efficient, making them ideal for various applications, including data centers, smartphones, and personal computers (PCs).Deloitte estimates that $250 billion to $300 billion could be spent on AI data center chips alone this year, up from an estimated $150 billion last year.",

    "fullText": "Two years. That's the ambitious timeline Boston Dynamics set for its Atlas humanoid robots to start working on Hyundai's factory floor.\n\nThe company's CEO, Robert Playter, told Business Insider at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that Atlas will need to hit several milestones within that timeframe to get there, including an ability to learn fast.\n\n\"We need to be able to bring a new task to bear in a day or two,\" Playter said. \"And that's because, I think in a factory, there's literally hundreds of tasks and the tasks evolve.\"\n\nAtlas is a six-foot, 200-pound, bipedal robot with a face inspired by Disney's Pixar lamp.\n\nHyundai, which has a controlling majority stake in Boston Dynamics, revealed on Monday its plans to deploy Atlas at its sprawling factory in Ellabell, Georgia, by 2028.\n\nThe big pitch behind Atlas is that the robot will be able to learn industrial tasks quickly and adapt to the existing floor plan of a factory by leveraging artificial intelligence.\n\n\"If you're going to have a robot that's actually useful in the factory, it's got to do a hundred different tasks, not just one or two,\" he said.\n\nBoston Dynamics announced on Monday a partnership with Google DeepMind, Alphabet's AI research lab.\n\nPlayter is hinging on AI's advancement within the next two years to unlock Atlas' ability to learn quickly, reason, and, in the near future, interact with its human coworkers.\n\n\"It's really AI that's going to enable that,\" he said. \"We also have to make that unprecedented reliability, 99.9% reliable. The AI is not quite there yet, but it's very promising.\"\n\nThe CEO said Atlas will start with simpler tasks at Hyundai's automotive plant, such as parts sequencing or organizing car parts in the right order before they're sent to the assembly line.\n\n\"That's really a logistics task,\" he said. \"And then we're going to evolve as the product and as the capabilities get more sophisticated. We're going to eventually start entering assembly tasks.\"",

The chips feature a new transistor design and a way to deliver power to the chip due to the company's 18A manufacturing process.\n\nAt the event, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said the company made good on its promise to ship its first products with the 18A manufacturing process in 2025, referring to ⁠the Panther Lake chips.\n\nIntel's prior-generation Lunar ‌Lake chips were largely made by TSMC. The stakes for Intel are high - the company is making its first high-volume product with 18A, and hopes to reclaim market share ‍it has lost to Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nJohnson said the company has created a separate graphics chiplet - a mini chip stitched together with other mini-chips to form a complete processor. On Monday, Intel said the Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips ​would deliver 60% better performance than the prior-generation Lunar Lake Series 2.\n\nIntel plans to launch a platform ‌for handheld video games based on the Panther Lake designs this year, Johnson said. Handheld PCs designed by a range of suppliers have grown in popularity in recent years.\n\nIntel has struggled with the yield, or the number of good chips per silicon wafer, for the Panther Lake processors, Reuters reported last year. Intel executives have said its yields are improving monthly and will pave the way for the launch this year.\n\nFor its part, ⁠AMD plans to give a CES keynote address at 9:30 p.m. ​EST on Monday  (0230 GMT on Tuesday). CEO Lisa Su will ​likely launch new generations of PC chips that are geared for AI and graphics.\n\nAMD announced a multibillion-dollar deal with OpenAI for its next-generation MI400 chips, some of which the companies ‍plan to deploy this year. ⁠The deal with the ChatGPT maker is expected to generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue for the chip designer.\n\nThe CEO of AI chip leader Nvidia, Jensen Huang, also spoke at CES ⁠on Monday. He said the company’s next generation of chips was in “full production,” and they could deliver five times the artificial-intelligence computing ‌of the company’s previous chips when serving up chatbots and other AI apps.",

    "description": "Justin Flint, 27,  has one big piece of advice for getting promoted after he went from the assembly line to software engineer at the same company.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Justin Flint, 27, a software engineer at an oven manufacturing factory near Seattle, Washington. His employment and progression has been verified by Business Insider. This piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThe first full-time job I could get after I dropped out of college in 2019 was in a factory building ovens, and it was miserable.\n\nInside the ovens, I'd be drenched in sweat and my safety glasses would fog up. I'd step out, wipe them off with my shirt, and get back to work, because that was my only option.\n\nIt was horrible transitioning from taking mechanical engineering classes at college to working in a factory in the early hours of the morning. But one thing I've learned over the years is the importance of patience.\n\nSometimes you need to stick at something long enough for opportunities to materialize. When they do, you can showcase your skills and move up in the world. That's what happened to me, and now I'm a software engineer at the same company.\n\nI fell in love with inventing things when I was a kid, and started 3D printing things as a teenager. One of my first inventions was a lid that stopped your knuckles from getting dirty when scraping peanut butter out from the bottom of a jar.\n\nIn 2017, I transferred from a college to a community college to be closer to home and continued studying mechanical engineering, then dropped out in 2019 to heal from a traumatic situation. I needed a full-time job and got hired to work on the assembly line at a local factory.\n\nThe job put me in a dark place. You'd show up before your 5 a.m. shift in steel-toe boots, wait in line to clock in, and then walk to your section of the assembly line.\n\nI remember thinking that my career had crumbled. I was working in a factory, I still wanted to be an engineer, and I knew I could do more.\n\nTwice a day, an engineer would oversee my work: using gauges to set sheet-metal shutters in the ovens. I was taking longer than management wanted, so the engineer asked me if I could find a way to do it faster or more efficiently.\n\nOne day, in May 2019, I wrote the dimensions of the gauges for each shutter on a sticky note. At home, I designed a fixture that would speed up my work by letting me set two shutters at once. I 3D printed it at home before my next shift, and took it in to show the engineer.\n\nAbout a week later, the engineer's boss came to the assembly line to ask if I had any experience with coding 3D printers, and I told him I had a tiny bit. A couple of weeks after that, I was asked to join the engineers for a brainstorm after work, which felt like a huge compliment.\n\nIn September, a position opened up for an engineering technician who would work on 3D designing sheet-metal parts for the ovens and printing inserts that would be used for oven handles. After applying and not hearing for a couple of months, I was thrilled to be selected for the job in December, which started in February 2020.\n\nI was intimidated at first, but proud that I'd moved up from the assembly line.\n\nAbout six months into the job, my manager asked me if I'd be willing to return to school if the company paid for it. It was a very easy \"yes,\" but it was hard to make it work. Five days a week, I drove for 40 minutes straight from work to school, took an hour-long class, and then drove back home.\n\nIt felt great to be back at school, learning C++, a programming language used for building software, and discovering how coding could open the door to developing things like apps. I realized coding was a missing component of my skillset.\n\nBut I was starting to feel burned out, so I decided to leave the oven factory in May 2022 to make more time for my studies.\n\nIn March 2023, I got my associate degree in engineering, computer science, and physics after studying full-time for about nine months. It was great to finally have something to show for all my years of hard work. It also gave me a safety net, a qualification that would prevent me from returning to the assembly line.\n\nWhen I finished college I needed another full-time job. The only one I could find was at a printing factory as a technician, loading large printers with paper and performing maintenance on them. Back to working in factories, I felt like a failure.\n\nIf I ever completed printing jobs early, I would go on my phone and listen to podcasts or watch YouTube tutorials on coding. I fell in love with programming.\n\nIn June 2023, the oven factory reached out and offered me a software developer position. When I took the job, it felt like being back home. I'll always appreciate them taking a bet on me.\n\nIt was a place where I'd originally not enjoyed working, because I saw it only for my job on the assembly line. But I felt like I was where I belonged when I returned as a software developer.\n\nI'm a software engineer II at the oven factory, which involves managing software projects, and my goal is to become a chief technology officer. The prospect of defining technological paths forward and designing tools that make people's lives easier sounds so exciting. It would take me back to my roots: inventing things.\n\nIt's what got me off the assembly line job, and if I hadn't taken the initiative to build a fixture and show it to the engineering team, I'd never have been promoted.\n\nUltimately, I had to step on a few toes— politely — to show what I was capable of.\n\nIt's easy to get stuck in a rut — trust me, I've been there — but I've learned that you can often invent your way out of a horrible situation. You simply need to search for opportunities to prove yourself.\n\nIf you study the work you do every day closely enough, you'll find something to improve, and that improvement could be your golden ticket to promotion.",

    "description": "A new alloy combines the best of the refractory metals with cutting-edge engineering. The material might just revolutionize modern manufacturing.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA new alloy combines the best of the refractory metals with cutting-edge engineering.\n\nEven these extremely tough metals can be made to deform and show bands of adjustment.\n\nThese kink bands add strength through subtle shifts in the crystal structure, reducing brittleness.\n\nIn recently published research, scientists have revealed a special alloy that could change the game with its combination of temperature tolerance, resistance to wear, and previously unheard of fracture toughness.\n\nHow do you make one alloy that has it all? The secret is a feature called a kink band, where the material naturally forms a certain way as it is heated and treated. As the saying goes, sometimes our flaws can lead to our greatest strengths. Turns out that’s also true for exotic alloys.\n\nMany metals are soft in their pure form—or, at least, softer than we’d like them to be for applications like manufacturing and heavy machinery. Long ago, humans realized they could combine two metals into one alloy (like bronze) and get results that were tougher, held a sharp edge better, and lasted longer.\n\nWhy are alloys so strong? Well, each element has its own atomic mass and particle size. Think about a pure metal like a game of Jenga. When you push on a block (or deform your metal), you know how that block is going to move. But in an alloy, your Jenga tower is built from blocks of different sizes, meaning it’s much harder to simply “push” (deform) them out of place. There are fewer of the neat lines that are prone to breakage.\n\nIn this paper, researchers from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and a handful of west coast universities collaborated on a new refractory alloy. Refractory—used colloquially to mean stubborn—in this case means an alloy that is extremely tolerant of very high heat. They’re made by combining metals from the fifth and sixth period of the periodic table of elements: molybdenum, niobium, tungsten, tangalum, and rhenium.\n\nThese elements have some of the highest melting points in the known periodic table. They also have very high hardness among the pure metals—although if we’re talking about materials in general, diamond still leaves them in the dust. That means when alloyed in a particular way, these metals (along with a few others with high melting points, like titanium and iridium) can become even more resistant to heat and wear, forming the family of refractory alloys.\n\nThere’s just a few problems. The same toughness and hardness that defines the refractory alloys often means they’re literally too hard to work with, with low ductility and a high likelihood of fracture. In other words, if you’re trying to metalwork a refractory alloy into any kind of shape, it will break instead of bend. We needed to find a middle ground where a very hard refractory alloy could take a hit and deform in the desired way rather than fracturing.\n\nTo do this, the Berkeley Lab scientists “specifically engineered” an alloy of niobium, tantalum, titanium, and hafnium, and formed kink bands in the metal. Inside a solid material like an alloy, kinks and jogs are terms referring to types of flaws that affect the alloy’s structure. Their details are more scientific, but a kink in a power cable or a street that jogs over a bit give you the intuitive idea. While the alloy forms, its crystal structures move around just enough to create these “stretch marks” or seams that show a change in crystal orientation.\n\nIn cables, a kink is often a sign of damage or unusual wear. In the crystals that we use as gemstones, a kink band might ruin the desired sparkly effect by disrupting how light passes through the material. But in the alloy, researchers found that the kink bands resulted from dislocation tolerance—meaning deformability without breaking. The particles in the alloy were able to adapt to a space where the crystals had shifted around, and those bands of adaptation made the results stronger.\n\n“Our work shows that contrary to conventional understanding, complex concentrated refractory alloys can possess exceptional fracture toughness across extreme temperature ranges, even in the cryogenic regime,” the scientists conclude. The next step is more research, since this is just one exploratory paper.\n\nBut in a world waiting on new technologies like quantum computing and nuclear fusion, the cryogenic regime—where materials are cooled to near absolute zero—is vital. The stronger we can make those materials, the better.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "Boeing is well-known for building and manufacturing aircraft, but it also owns several aviation companies. Here's everything you need to know.",
    "fullText": "Over more than a century in the aerospace industry, Boeing has gone through many iterations. It began building primitive seaplanes in the early 20th century under the moniker Pacific Aero Products Co. — later redubbed Boeing Airplane Co. In 1961, the company ditched the qualifiers and changed its name to simply Boeing, partly because it had expanded into other arenas outside of aerospace.\n\nToday, Boeing builds military aircraft, helicopters, spacecraft, missiles, and more. Boeing also built the Lunar Roving Vehicles (the Moon buggies) which were driven by astronauts on the lunar surface during the last three Apollo missions. Boeing is also, and long has been, the world's largest manufacturer of commercial jets.\n\nBoeing is most well known for designing and manufacturing aircraft, it's a name which is almost synonymous with airplanes, but it's also a massive company with hundreds of subsidiaries. Some are research and development operations, others build parts or craft software for navigation or defense, and others create rockets and spaceships. Of course, some of Boeing's subsidiaries are precisely what you'd expect, aerospace companies doing aerospace things. Here are five aviation companies you might not know are owned by Boeing.\n\nAutonomous or remotely operated aircraft, commonly called drones or UAVs (short for uncrewed aerial vehicles), have become common in toy stores and hobby shops. You can get simple and affordable drones to fly around your backyard or more complex ones for racing, filmmaking, and other activities. Meanwhile, there's another class of drone used for scientific research and military applications. Those are the sorts of drones Insitu makes.\n\nThe company was founded in 1994, with the goal of developing small robotic aircraft, and achieved early milestones like the first uncrewed transatlantic flight in 1998. Insitu was acquired by Boeing in 2008 and, today, it's a wholly owned subsidiary of Boeing, headquartered in Bingen, Washington.\n\nWhile Boeing is mostly known for passenger airplanes, Insitu offers a range of UAVs including the Integrator VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing), Integrator extended range, Integrator, ScanEagle VTOL, ScanEagle, and RQ-21A. These can also be supplemented with payloads including cameras, laser guidance, wide-area search instruments, and more.\n\nSpirit AeroSystems (not to be confused with Spirit Airlines) began as the Stearman Aircraft Company, founded by Lloyd Stearman, back in the early 20th century. It was later purchased by The United Aircraft and Transport Company (later Boeing) in 1929.",

    "description": "Posters that appeared at Tesla's California factories and a review of LinkedIn profiles show how the automaker is scaling its ride-hailing service.",
    "fullText": "Tesla is going all in on its \"Robotaxi\" service — and putting factory workers and sales staff in drivers' seats to make it happen.\n\nThe electric-car maker has started recruiting workers off factory lines to operate its ride-hailing fleet. Tesla is offering production associates and material handlers extra hours and pay to take on the role of AI operator, according to posters that appeared at its California factories earlier this month.\n\nThe AI operators sit in the driver's seat, actively monitoring the vehicle while Tesla's Full Self-Driving software is engaged, and taking over when needed. Tesla plans to eventually release the software as a fully autonomous service.\n\nThe extra sets of hands will help the company expand ride-hailing availability in the Bay Area, the posters said.\n\nThe posters, which also appeared in several engineering facilities, noted that staffers could earn $500 if they refer a friend for the AI operator role.\n\nSome sales staffers in Nevada and Arizona moved over to similar operator roles in Las Vegas and Phoenix last month, according to a review of LinkedIn profiles.\n\nAdding more operators could help Tesla speed up service. After Tesla rolled out its Robotaxi app to the public in September, wait times spiked, with some passengers reporting on social media wait times as long as 40 minutes and a lack of available vehicles.\n\nBusiness Insider's Alistair Barr said he's recently seen wait times around 10 minutes in the Bay Area, and during peak commuting times, the app at times says it cannot provide a ride due to \"high service demand.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTesla completed the self-certification process for service in Nevada and Arizona last month. It has yet to apply for a license with the Nevada Transportation Authority to launch a commercial service, but it has a permit from the Arizona Department of Transportation that allows it to operate commercially in the state, spokespeople from the agencies told Business Insider.\n\nThe company has yet to begin offering paid rides in either state.\n\nMeanwhile, the company launched its Bay Area ride-hailing service in August. It's not registered as an autonomous vehicle service in California; it operates its service with a driver because the state has stricter regulations around autonomous vehicles than most other states, many of which operate around an honor system where the company self-certifies its vehicles.\n\nTesla has a permit from the California Public Utilities Commission that allows it to provide transportation services to employees and some members of the public as a regular car service with a driver. The agency has said Tesla is not authorized to transport members of the public in an autonomous vehicle.\n\nTesla currently has 1,655 vehicles and 798 drivers registered for its ride-hailing service in California, according to a spokesperson for the CPUC. Tesla is required to update the agency incrementally as it adds new vehicles to the fleet, but not drivers, the spokesperson said. (The registration number reflects vehicles approved for use; it doesn't necessarily indicate how many are operating at any given time.)\n\nLast December, Tesla registered more than 220 test drivers and 100 vehicles for a permit with the California Department of Motor Vehicles that would allow it to test its autonomous software with a test driver.\n\nA spokesperson for the DMV said Tesla has yet to apply for a driverless testing permit, which would be required before the company can offer AV rides to the public.\n\nThe company also operates a ride-hailing service in Austin, where it launched with a safety operator in the passenger seat.\n\nMusk said during an xAI event earlier this month that Tesla's Austin service will be driverless by the end of the year.\n\n\"I think it's pretty much a solved problem, we're going through validation right now,\" he said, according to a recording posted on social media.\n\nA spokesperson for the Austin Transportation Department told Business Insider that the company has yet to inform the city of the date it plans to roll out the driverless feature to its commercial service. Tesla is not legally required to inform the city, but it has typically alerted it to changes to its service, the spokesperson said.\n\nTesla is hiring for AI operators across the US, including in Illinois, Massachusetts, Colorado, and Texas, according to its website. The role has around-the-clock shifts and requires workers to sit behind the wheel while FSD is engaged, interact with passengers, and collect detailed reports on vehicle performance. It can also involve testing in various cities across the country. The salary ranges from around $25 to $30 per hour.\n\nThe recruiting process involved an FSD test drive, a valid driver's license, and passing a drug test and background check, according to people who interviewed for the role.\n\nMusk said in October that the company plans to expand its service to eight to 10 metropolitan areas by the end of the year. The company is testing its service in several cities across the country.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip? Contact this reporter via email at gkay@businessinsider.com or Signal at 248-894-6012.

In late October, it suspended supplies of wafers to the Chinese unit, while a Dutch court ordered Wingtech's founder be removed as Nexperia CEO.\n\nBeijing responded by halting exports of Nexperia's finished products, triggering chip shortages for global automakers.\n\nBoth governments relaxed their measures last month, but court fights and an internal battle continue over control ⁠of Nexperia, with China and Wingtech both warning ‌that disruptions could resume without a long-term resolution.\n\nIn a letter sent to its distributors earlier this month and seen by Reuters, Nexperia's China unit said it had locked in wafer production capacity for IGBT products with ‍local suppliers for 2026 and was accelerating verification of wafers from Wingtech's foundry Wingsky Semi to ensure \"abundant supply.\"\n\nThe previously unreported move marks a further supply-chain separation between Nexperia China and its Dutch parent that could lead to a complete split.\n\nNexperia told Reuters that it was not in communication with its Chinese ​subsidiary and the unit showed \"no intention to negotiate a short-term solution to restore the flow of chips to customers.\"\n\nThe company said that ‌IGBT products accounted for about 0.1% of Nexperia total revenue in 2024.\n\nNexperia China did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nBeijing last week called on the Dutch government to implement the consensus they reached on encouraging negotiations between Nexperia and Wingtech and to urge the chipmaker to send representatives to China as soon as possible for talks.\n\nNexperia China has told local distributors wafer inventory at its factory in Dongguan in southern China's Guangdong province is low as supply from the Netherlands is not expected to resume soon, a ⁠person familiar with the matter said.",

    "fullText": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Federal regulators will allow tech companies to effectively plug massive data centers directly into power plants, issuing a long-awaited order Thursday, as the Trump administration urges it to help the U.S. lead the world in artificial intelligence and revive domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's unanimous order is designed to clear up pressing issues around so-called “colocation” agreements in the nation's largest grid territory, which stretches across mid-Atlantic states to parts of Illinois and Indiana.\n\nBut it could become a blueprint for how FERC handles an October request from Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, to ensure that data centers and large manufacturers get the power they need as quickly as possible.\n\nIt also comes amid concerns that the mid-Atlantic territory covering some 65 million people will face electricity shortages in the coming years, as the build out of data centers outpaces the speed of new power sources coming online.\n\nLaura Swett, FERC’s chair, told Thursday's meeting that clearing the way for massive energy users — like data centers — to get electricity straight from power plants was a “critical step to give investors and consumers more certainty on how FERC believes we can solve the problem of meeting historic surging demand and realize our greatest potential as a country.”\n\nIt would, she said, also protect regular ratepayers, even as evidence mounts in various states that regular ratepayers are bearing the cost of new power plants and transmission lines to feed energy hungry data centers.\n\nPower plant owners applauded the step, as their share prices rose steeply in Thursday's trading. Advanced Energy United, whose members provide solar and wind power, said the FERC order should help clarify how big power users can set up their own power sources.\n\nThe Edison Electric Institute, which represents for-profit utilities, said only that it would “continue to work” to support rapid data center connection, protect ratepayers from cost-shifts and strengthen the grid for everyone.\n\nJeff Dennis, executive director of the Electricity Customer Alliance, said the order showed that FERC is trying to address looming issues around fast-growing power demand and underscored the urgency to reform grid policy.\n\nThursday's order grew out of a dispute between power plant owners and electric utilities over a proposed colocation deal between Amazon’s cloud-computing subsidiary and the owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.\n\nFor tech giants, such arrangements represent a quick fix to quickly get power while avoiding a potentially longer and more expensive process of hooking into a fraying electric grid that serves everyone else.\n\nBut utilities protested that it allows big power users to avoid paying them to maintain the grid. Some consumer advocates maintained that diverting energy from existing power plants to data centers could drive up energy prices without an answer for how rising power demand will be met for regular ratepayers.\n\nFERC's Thursday order sets up a couple new regulatory tracks.\n\nIt requires the operator of the mid-Atlantic grid, PJM Interconnection, to develop rates and conditions for different colocation scenarios involving new power plants or sources.\n\nThat could mean allowing a big power user to pay for only the transmission services they use, considerably less than they might otherwise pay to connect to the grid through a utility.\n\nThe order also could require a big power user that colocates with an existing power plant to pay the cost to replace the energy that it diverts away from the broader electric grid.\n\nFollow Marc Levy on X at https://x.com/timelywriter.",

    "title": "China may have reverse engineered EUV lithography tool in covert lab, report claims — employees given fake IDs to avoid secret project being detected, prototypes expected in 2028",
    "description": "China has reportedly built and begun testing a secret EUV lithography prototype using ASML-style laser-produced plasma technology. Yet, despite generating 13.5-nm light, the system remains unable to make chips and appears to be years away from achieving a complete, production-ready EUV manufacturing capability.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nA secret laboratory in China has quietly assembled a prototype extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography system and is now testing it stealthily, which means that the country may be close to replicating the most advanced technology that currently exists on Earth, reports Reuters.\n\nThe tool was reportedly developed by reverse engineering existing scanners from ASML and is said to be on-track to make prototype chips in 2028. If the information is correct, then Chinese scientists have made numerous breakthroughs across multiple disciplines in just a few years instead of decades, a scenario that appears extremely unlikely. Further analysis of the report indicates that China's laboratory is far from completing the tool, meaning that the country is years away from making chips using EUV lithography.\n\nThe system was reportedly completed in early 2025 inside a highly secured facility in Shenzhen and occupies nearly an entire factory floor. The Chinese machine reportedly generates EUV light with a wavelength of 13.5nm using the same laser-produced plasma (LPP) method as ASML Twinscan NXE machines, not the particle accelerator-based steady-state microbunching (SSMB) method designed at Tsinghua University or discharge-produced plasma (DPP) technology developed at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), which might prove the point that the system was reverse-engineered or at least contains a substantial amount of technologies pioneered by ASML.\n\nASML's laser-produced plasma (LPP) method uses tiny molten tin droplets, roughly 25–30 microns in diameter, which are injected into a vacuum chamber at a rate of about 50,000 droplets per second. Then, a high-power CO₂ laser first fires a low-intensity pre-pulse at each droplet, flattening it into a disk-like shape, followed by a more powerful main pulse that vaporizes the flattened tin and creates a superheated plasma with temperatures exceeding 200,000°C. This plasma emits isotropic EUV light, which is then collected by a large multilayer collector mirror and directed into the lithography system's reflective optics for patterning silicon wafers. This process repeats tens of thousands of times per second.\n\nThe machine is reportedly larger than the original, but it is operational in the sense that it can generate EUV radiation. However, it has not progressed to make usable chips as it still struggles to replicate 'the precision optical systems' features by Twinscan NXE systems. Furthermore, there is no word about power of the EUV light source, a crucial parameter that defines whether a tool can or cannot be used for volume production.\n\nThe report clearly states that the Chinese EUV scanner cannot currently be used to make chips, but the Chinese government reportedly wants the first chip prototypes to emerge in 2028, two or three years down the road. However, a more realistic target is 2030, four or five years from now, which is a long time. Meanwhile, from the report, it is not completely clear what stage the Chinese team is at today.\n\nThe report does not disclose which specific components of the optical system are the primary bottlenecks, as the article groups them rather generally. In particular, it is uncertain if the alleged EUV tool struggles to replicate the ultra-precise collector mirror system coated with multilayer molybdenum-silicon (Mo/Si) stacks, illuminator optics (which shapes and uniforms the beam using faceted mirrors), or projection optics (a series of aspheric mirrors for 4X – 8X reduction imaging with sub-nanometer wavefront errors). ASML outsources the development and production of these components to Carl Zeiss from Germany. If the developers failed to replicate the collector itself, then the rest of the machine can hardly be called an EUV lithography system, as technically, the only thing they have is some kind of light source that they have yet to learn how to use. Yet, even if the developers cannot replicate illuminator optics or projection optics (suggesting that the collector itself is there), it still means they do not have even a poorly working EUV lithography tool, but rather a set of certain components.\n\nWhen talking about advanced lithography equipment, we must keep in mind that such tools rely on seamless integration of sophisticated light sources, advanced optics, ultra-precise mechanical engineering, complex control software, and specialized materials, all of which must function reliably within nanometer-scale tolerances demanded by modern chip manufacturing. The story has no word about the state of the mechanical systems of the alleged tool: we know nothing about the wafer stocker system, wafer stages, or reticle stages, all of which are crucial for operation and yields.\n\nTo put China's EUV efforts into perspective, the secret lab is not even close to building an alpha tool. For now, what the Chinese lab has cannot even put the light on a wafer, save for printing lines and spaces, something ASML's tool could do in 2006, about 11 years before the company shipped its first Twinscan NXE:3400B system meant for high-volume manufacturing. Of course, reverse engineering certain components can give Chinese engineers a speed boost, but it remains to be seen how significant this one is going to be.\n\nAccording to Reuters's sources familiar with the effort, the Chinese EUV tool was 'developed' by a team that includes former engineers from ASML and recent university graduates, who allegedly reverse-engineered the company's EUV machines. The secret lab was so stealthy that its employees were given fake IDs to avoid detection of their concentration in one place by foreign spies.\n\nYet, it is unclear how any engineers from China could reverse engineer an EUV lithography scanner, as the Dutch company has never supplied one to China and hardly taught personnel from China how to service its EUV systems that are not allowed to be shipped to the People's Republic.\n\nReverse engineering a machine that contains over 100,000 parts is a hard task that takes hundreds of engineers with knowledge of the matter, which is why the secret entity led by the Government of China hired not only former engineers from ASML China, but also former employees of the Dutch company from elsewhere, presumably from Europe, Taiwan, and the U.S. For example, Lin Nan, formerly responsible for EUV light source technology at ASML, now leads a team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Shanghai Institute of Optics that has filed eight EUV-related patents in just 18 months. Yet, this may mean that he uses his experience and knowledge rather than trying to replicate what he did at ASML or reverse engineer what he did at ASML due to the absence of an EUV scanner in his lab.\n\n“It makes sense that companies would want to replicate our technology, but doing so is no small feat,” a statement by ASML published by Reuters reads.\n\nThe report says that around 100 recent university graduates are tasked with reverse-engineering parts from EUV and DUV lithography tools, with each workplace monitored by a dedicated camera that records the disassembly and reassembly process, an important part of the whole China's lithography program, according to the report. Employees who successfully put components back together receive bonuses. Yet again, a Twinscan NXE tool is a mechanism consisting of over 100,000 parts working together, not just a sum of all parts.\n\nTo sum up, China has reportedly built a secret prototype EUV lithography system and begun testing it, which suggests that the country may be closer to reproducing the most advanced chipmaking technology in existence than previously believed. However, details provided by the report indicate that China is still years — if not a decade — away from making chips using EUV lithography.\n\nThe machine can generate 13.5-nm EUV light using the same laser-produced plasma (LPP) method employed by ASML, which may demonstrate extensive reverse engineering of Western technology rather than the use of alternative domestic approaches. However, the tool is significantly larger than commercial systems available today, it cannot produce usable chips, and appears to struggle with other elements of EUV lithography, particularly ultra-precise optics supplied to ASML by Carl Zeiss. In fact, details about the system like light source power, optical subsystem maturity, and the state of critical mechanical components remain unclear.\n\nWhile China expects first prototype EUV chips to emerge in 2028, Reuters's sources suggest 2030 is more realistic. Yet, the whole effort relies heavily on recruiting former ASML engineers and reverse engineering parts from existing EUV and DUV tools, which are not only hard to develop, but are extremely hard to make. Meanwhile, there is no word whether the current team responsible for disassembling and reassembling components can actually make an ultra-complex machine consisting of over 100,000 parts work flawlessly to produce semiconductors in high volumes.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.",

    "description": "The judge ruled Tesla should have to suspend manufacturing and sales in California for 30 days, but the DMV stayed those rulings for 90 days to allow Tesla to comply.",
    "fullText": "An administrative law judge has ruled that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing that gave customers a false impression of the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving driver assistance software, a pivotal development in a years-long case initiated by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nThe judge agreed with the state DMV’s request to suspend Tesla sales for 30 days as a penalty for its actions, but the DMV stayed the order and is giving Tesla 60 days to modify or remove any deceptive language before implementing the suspension, according to multiple outlets. The judge also recommended suspending Tesla’s manufacturing license for 30 days, but the DMV stayed that order, too, according to Bloomberg News.\n\n“The DMV’s decision today confirms that the department will hold every vehicle manufacturer to the highest safety standards to keep California’s drivers, passengers and pedestrians protected,” DMV director Steve Gordon said in a statement. “Tesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue — steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve in California’s nation-leading and supportive innovation marketplace.”\n\nTesla said in a post on X that: “Sales in California will continue uninterrupted.”\n\n“This was a ‘consumer protection’ order about the use of the term ‘Autopilot’ in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there’s a problem,” the company wrote.\n\nAfter the 60-day window, Tesla can appeal the decision and should Tesla comply, the suspensions will be dropped. But it’s not immediately clear what steps the DMV wants Tesla to take, beyond telling the company to “take action regarding its use of the term ‘autopilot.’” The DMV did not immediately respond to a request for clarification, or to a request regarding Tesla’s apparent plan to ignore the decision.\n\nTesla has faced multiple investigations from the California Attorney General, the Department of Justice, and the Securities and Exchange Commission over similar allegations that its marketing around partial autonomy systems was misleading. The company has also faced (and now settled) a number of personal civil lawsuits over crashes involving its Autopilot technology.\n\nThe case brought by the CA DMV has been winding through the state’s Office of Administrative Hearings for years. The agency essentially accused Tesla of making customers believe that its advanced driver assistance systems were capable of high levels of autonomy. This led to overconfidence in the systems, the DMV alleged, which has contributed to dozens of crashes and multiple deaths. Tesla refuted these claims by saying its marketing was protected speech.\n\nA shutdown of sales in California, even temporary, could have a major impact on Tesla’s business as it remains the company’s largest market in the United States. A manufacturing suspension could also hurt Tesla’s business. While the company has constructed a massive factory in Austin, Texas (and moved its official headquarters to the same location), it still relies on its Fremont, California factory to make hundreds of thousands of vehicles, including all North American-bound Model 3 sedans.\n\nThe judge’s decision comes at a moment when Tesla is advancing its Robotaxi service test in Austin. Over the weekend, the company removed the safety monitors from its small fleet in the city. It had been offering rides to customers in the city for the last six months, but with a safety monitor either in the driver’s or passenger’s seat. Those vehicles are running a different version of Tesla’s driving software than what the automaker’s customers have in their cars, CEO Elon Musk has said.\n\nThis story has been updated to include information from the DMV’s press release and Tesla’s response.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 11 - Major automakers on Thursday urged Washington to prevent Chinese government-backed automakers and battery manufacturers from opening U.S. ​manufacturing plants, warning the industry's future is at stake.\n\nThe Alliance for Automotive ‌Innovation, which represents General Motors, Ford, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen, Hyundai, Stellantis and other major automakers, sounded the ‌alarm and said Congress and the Trump administration needed to act.\n\n\"China poses a clear and present threat to the auto industry in the U.S.,\" the group wrote in a statement for a U.S. House hearing on Chinese vehicles. The group also said ⁠lawmakers should maintain the U.S. ‌Commerce Department's prohibition on importing information and communications technology and services from China that effectively bars the import of vehicles from ‍Chinese manufacturers.\n\n\"No amount of investment by automakers and battery manufacturers operating inside the U.S. can counter a China that is enabled by subsidies to chronically oversupply around the world. This is ​a recipe for dumping that Congress and the Trump Administration must prevent ‌from happening inside the U.S.,\" the auto industry group said.\n\nRepresentative John Moolenaar, a Republican who chairs a select House committee on China, said Congress should codify into law the prohibitions on Chinese-connected vehicles that were adopted in the final days of former President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"In just five years, China has gone from a minor ⁠exporter to the world's largest auto exporter, shipping ​6 million vehicles abroad last year at below ​market prices that U.S. and allied automakers cannot match,\" Moolenaar said. \"With massive subsidies, control over raw materials and supply chains and a ‍predatory regulatory regime, Beijing ⁠has turned its auto industry into a tool of the state.\n\nHe also cited national security concerns about Chinese-imported vehicles and concerns that Beijing could ⁠disable vehicles with Chinese-made software or components in the event of a major confrontation.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in ‌Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
