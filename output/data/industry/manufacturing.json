    "description": "A new alloy combines the best of the refractory metals with cutting-edge engineering. The material might just revolutionize modern manufacturing.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA new alloy combines the best of the refractory metals with cutting-edge engineering.\n\nEven these extremely tough metals can be made to deform and show bands of adjustment.\n\nThese kink bands add strength through subtle shifts in the crystal structure, reducing brittleness.\n\nIn recently published research, scientists have revealed a special alloy that could change the game with its combination of temperature tolerance, resistance to wear, and previously unheard of fracture toughness.\n\nHow do you make one alloy that has it all? The secret is a feature called a kink band, where the material naturally forms a certain way as it is heated and treated. As the saying goes, sometimes our flaws can lead to our greatest strengths. Turns out that’s also true for exotic alloys.\n\nMany metals are soft in their pure form—or, at least, softer than we’d like them to be for applications like manufacturing and heavy machinery. Long ago, humans realized they could combine two metals into one alloy (like bronze) and get results that were tougher, held a sharp edge better, and lasted longer.\n\nWhy are alloys so strong? Well, each element has its own atomic mass and particle size. Think about a pure metal like a game of Jenga. When you push on a block (or deform your metal), you know how that block is going to move. But in an alloy, your Jenga tower is built from blocks of different sizes, meaning it’s much harder to simply “push” (deform) them out of place. There are fewer of the neat lines that are prone to breakage.\n\nIn this paper, researchers from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and a handful of west coast universities collaborated on a new refractory alloy. Refractory—used colloquially to mean stubborn—in this case means an alloy that is extremely tolerant of very high heat. They’re made by combining metals from the fifth and sixth period of the periodic table of elements: molybdenum, niobium, tungsten, tangalum, and rhenium.\n\nThese elements have some of the highest melting points in the known periodic table. They also have very high hardness among the pure metals—although if we’re talking about materials in general, diamond still leaves them in the dust. That means when alloyed in a particular way, these metals (along with a few others with high melting points, like titanium and iridium) can become even more resistant to heat and wear, forming the family of refractory alloys.\n\nThere’s just a few problems. The same toughness and hardness that defines the refractory alloys often means they’re literally too hard to work with, with low ductility and a high likelihood of fracture. In other words, if you’re trying to metalwork a refractory alloy into any kind of shape, it will break instead of bend. We needed to find a middle ground where a very hard refractory alloy could take a hit and deform in the desired way rather than fracturing.\n\nTo do this, the Berkeley Lab scientists “specifically engineered” an alloy of niobium, tantalum, titanium, and hafnium, and formed kink bands in the metal. Inside a solid material like an alloy, kinks and jogs are terms referring to types of flaws that affect the alloy’s structure. Their details are more scientific, but a kink in a power cable or a street that jogs over a bit give you the intuitive idea. While the alloy forms, its crystal structures move around just enough to create these “stretch marks” or seams that show a change in crystal orientation.\n\nIn cables, a kink is often a sign of damage or unusual wear. In the crystals that we use as gemstones, a kink band might ruin the desired sparkly effect by disrupting how light passes through the material. But in the alloy, researchers found that the kink bands resulted from dislocation tolerance—meaning deformability without breaking. The particles in the alloy were able to adapt to a space where the crystals had shifted around, and those bands of adaptation made the results stronger.\n\n“Our work shows that contrary to conventional understanding, complex concentrated refractory alloys can possess exceptional fracture toughness across extreme temperature ranges, even in the cryogenic regime,” the scientists conclude. The next step is more research, since this is just one exploratory paper.\n\nBut in a world waiting on new technologies like quantum computing and nuclear fusion, the cryogenic regime—where materials are cooled to near absolute zero—is vital. The stronger we can make those materials, the better.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "Boeing is well-known for building and manufacturing aircraft, but it also owns several aviation companies. Here's everything you need to know.",
    "fullText": "Over more than a century in the aerospace industry, Boeing has gone through many iterations. It began building primitive seaplanes in the early 20th century under the moniker Pacific Aero Products Co. — later redubbed Boeing Airplane Co. In 1961, the company ditched the qualifiers and changed its name to simply Boeing, partly because it had expanded into other arenas outside of aerospace.\n\nToday, Boeing builds military aircraft, helicopters, spacecraft, missiles, and more. Boeing also built the Lunar Roving Vehicles (the Moon buggies) which were driven by astronauts on the lunar surface during the last three Apollo missions. Boeing is also, and long has been, the world's largest manufacturer of commercial jets.\n\nBoeing is most well known for designing and manufacturing aircraft, it's a name which is almost synonymous with airplanes, but it's also a massive company with hundreds of subsidiaries. Some are research and development operations, others build parts or craft software for navigation or defense, and others create rockets and spaceships. Of course, some of Boeing's subsidiaries are precisely what you'd expect, aerospace companies doing aerospace things. Here are five aviation companies you might not know are owned by Boeing.\n\nAutonomous or remotely operated aircraft, commonly called drones or UAVs (short for uncrewed aerial vehicles), have become common in toy stores and hobby shops. You can get simple and affordable drones to fly around your backyard or more complex ones for racing, filmmaking, and other activities. Meanwhile, there's another class of drone used for scientific research and military applications. Those are the sorts of drones Insitu makes.\n\nThe company was founded in 1994, with the goal of developing small robotic aircraft, and achieved early milestones like the first uncrewed transatlantic flight in 1998. Insitu was acquired by Boeing in 2008 and, today, it's a wholly owned subsidiary of Boeing, headquartered in Bingen, Washington.\n\nWhile Boeing is mostly known for passenger airplanes, Insitu offers a range of UAVs including the Integrator VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing), Integrator extended range, Integrator, ScanEagle VTOL, ScanEagle, and RQ-21A. These can also be supplemented with payloads including cameras, laser guidance, wide-area search instruments, and more.\n\nSpirit AeroSystems (not to be confused with Spirit Airlines) began as the Stearman Aircraft Company, founded by Lloyd Stearman, back in the early 20th century. It was later purchased by The United Aircraft and Transport Company (later Boeing) in 1929.",

    "description": "Posters that appeared at Tesla's California factories and a review of LinkedIn profiles show how the automaker is scaling its ride-hailing service.",
    "fullText": "Tesla is going all in on its \"Robotaxi\" service — and putting factory workers and sales staff in drivers' seats to make it happen.\n\nThe electric-car maker has started recruiting workers off factory lines to operate its ride-hailing fleet. Tesla is offering production associates and material handlers extra hours and pay to take on the role of AI operator, according to posters that appeared at its California factories earlier this month.\n\nThe AI operators sit in the driver's seat, actively monitoring the vehicle while Tesla's Full Self-Driving software is engaged, and taking over when needed. Tesla plans to eventually release the software as a fully autonomous service.\n\nThe extra sets of hands will help the company expand ride-hailing availability in the Bay Area, the posters said.\n\nThe posters, which also appeared in several engineering facilities, noted that staffers could earn $500 if they refer a friend for the AI operator role.\n\nSome sales staffers in Nevada and Arizona moved over to similar operator roles in Las Vegas and Phoenix last month, according to a review of LinkedIn profiles.\n\nAdding more operators could help Tesla speed up service. After Tesla rolled out its Robotaxi app to the public in September, wait times spiked, with some passengers reporting on social media wait times as long as 40 minutes and a lack of available vehicles.\n\nBusiness Insider's Alistair Barr said he's recently seen wait times around 10 minutes in the Bay Area, and during peak commuting times, the app at times says it cannot provide a ride due to \"high service demand.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTesla completed the self-certification process for service in Nevada and Arizona last month. It has yet to apply for a license with the Nevada Transportation Authority to launch a commercial service, but it has a permit from the Arizona Department of Transportation that allows it to operate commercially in the state, spokespeople from the agencies told Business Insider.\n\nThe company has yet to begin offering paid rides in either state.\n\nMeanwhile, the company launched its Bay Area ride-hailing service in August. It's not registered as an autonomous vehicle service in California; it operates its service with a driver because the state has stricter regulations around autonomous vehicles than most other states, many of which operate around an honor system where the company self-certifies its vehicles.\n\nTesla has a permit from the California Public Utilities Commission that allows it to provide transportation services to employees and some members of the public as a regular car service with a driver. The agency has said Tesla is not authorized to transport members of the public in an autonomous vehicle.\n\nTesla currently has 1,655 vehicles and 798 drivers registered for its ride-hailing service in California, according to a spokesperson for the CPUC. Tesla is required to update the agency incrementally as it adds new vehicles to the fleet, but not drivers, the spokesperson said. (The registration number reflects vehicles approved for use; it doesn't necessarily indicate how many are operating at any given time.)\n\nLast December, Tesla registered more than 220 test drivers and 100 vehicles for a permit with the California Department of Motor Vehicles that would allow it to test its autonomous software with a test driver.\n\nA spokesperson for the DMV said Tesla has yet to apply for a driverless testing permit, which would be required before the company can offer AV rides to the public.\n\nThe company also operates a ride-hailing service in Austin, where it launched with a safety operator in the passenger seat.\n\nMusk said during an xAI event earlier this month that Tesla's Austin service will be driverless by the end of the year.\n\n\"I think it's pretty much a solved problem, we're going through validation right now,\" he said, according to a recording posted on social media.\n\nA spokesperson for the Austin Transportation Department told Business Insider that the company has yet to inform the city of the date it plans to roll out the driverless feature to its commercial service. Tesla is not legally required to inform the city, but it has typically alerted it to changes to its service, the spokesperson said.\n\nTesla is hiring for AI operators across the US, including in Illinois, Massachusetts, Colorado, and Texas, according to its website. The role has around-the-clock shifts and requires workers to sit behind the wheel while FSD is engaged, interact with passengers, and collect detailed reports on vehicle performance. It can also involve testing in various cities across the country. The salary ranges from around $25 to $30 per hour.\n\nThe recruiting process involved an FSD test drive, a valid driver's license, and passing a drug test and background check, according to people who interviewed for the role.\n\nMusk said in October that the company plans to expand its service to eight to 10 metropolitan areas by the end of the year. The company is testing its service in several cities across the country.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip? Contact this reporter via email at gkay@businessinsider.com or Signal at 248-894-6012.

In late October, it suspended supplies of wafers to the Chinese unit, while a Dutch court ordered Wingtech's founder be removed as Nexperia CEO.\n\nBeijing responded by halting exports of Nexperia's finished products, triggering chip shortages for global automakers.\n\nBoth governments relaxed their measures last month, but court fights and an internal battle continue over control ⁠of Nexperia, with China and Wingtech both warning ‌that disruptions could resume without a long-term resolution.\n\nIn a letter sent to its distributors earlier this month and seen by Reuters, Nexperia's China unit said it had locked in wafer production capacity for IGBT products with ‍local suppliers for 2026 and was accelerating verification of wafers from Wingtech's foundry Wingsky Semi to ensure \"abundant supply.\"\n\nThe previously unreported move marks a further supply-chain separation between Nexperia China and its Dutch parent that could lead to a complete split.\n\nNexperia told Reuters that it was not in communication with its Chinese ​subsidiary and the unit showed \"no intention to negotiate a short-term solution to restore the flow of chips to customers.\"\n\nThe company said that ‌IGBT products accounted for about 0.1% of Nexperia total revenue in 2024.\n\nNexperia China did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nBeijing last week called on the Dutch government to implement the consensus they reached on encouraging negotiations between Nexperia and Wingtech and to urge the chipmaker to send representatives to China as soon as possible for talks.\n\nNexperia China has told local distributors wafer inventory at its factory in Dongguan in southern China's Guangdong province is low as supply from the Netherlands is not expected to resume soon, a ⁠person familiar with the matter said.",

    "fullText": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Federal regulators will allow tech companies to effectively plug massive data centers directly into power plants, issuing a long-awaited order Thursday, as the Trump administration urges it to help the U.S. lead the world in artificial intelligence and revive domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's unanimous order is designed to clear up pressing issues around so-called “colocation” agreements in the nation's largest grid territory, which stretches across mid-Atlantic states to parts of Illinois and Indiana.\n\nBut it could become a blueprint for how FERC handles an October request from Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, to ensure that data centers and large manufacturers get the power they need as quickly as possible.\n\nIt also comes amid concerns that the mid-Atlantic territory covering some 65 million people will face electricity shortages in the coming years, as the build out of data centers outpaces the speed of new power sources coming online.\n\nLaura Swett, FERC’s chair, told Thursday's meeting that clearing the way for massive energy users — like data centers — to get electricity straight from power plants was a “critical step to give investors and consumers more certainty on how FERC believes we can solve the problem of meeting historic surging demand and realize our greatest potential as a country.”\n\nIt would, she said, also protect regular ratepayers, even as evidence mounts in various states that regular ratepayers are bearing the cost of new power plants and transmission lines to feed energy hungry data centers.\n\nPower plant owners applauded the step, as their share prices rose steeply in Thursday's trading. Advanced Energy United, whose members provide solar and wind power, said the FERC order should help clarify how big power users can set up their own power sources.\n\nThe Edison Electric Institute, which represents for-profit utilities, said only that it would “continue to work” to support rapid data center connection, protect ratepayers from cost-shifts and strengthen the grid for everyone.\n\nJeff Dennis, executive director of the Electricity Customer Alliance, said the order showed that FERC is trying to address looming issues around fast-growing power demand and underscored the urgency to reform grid policy.\n\nThursday's order grew out of a dispute between power plant owners and electric utilities over a proposed colocation deal between Amazon’s cloud-computing subsidiary and the owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.\n\nFor tech giants, such arrangements represent a quick fix to quickly get power while avoiding a potentially longer and more expensive process of hooking into a fraying electric grid that serves everyone else.\n\nBut utilities protested that it allows big power users to avoid paying them to maintain the grid. Some consumer advocates maintained that diverting energy from existing power plants to data centers could drive up energy prices without an answer for how rising power demand will be met for regular ratepayers.\n\nFERC's Thursday order sets up a couple new regulatory tracks.\n\nIt requires the operator of the mid-Atlantic grid, PJM Interconnection, to develop rates and conditions for different colocation scenarios involving new power plants or sources.\n\nThat could mean allowing a big power user to pay for only the transmission services they use, considerably less than they might otherwise pay to connect to the grid through a utility.\n\nThe order also could require a big power user that colocates with an existing power plant to pay the cost to replace the energy that it diverts away from the broader electric grid.\n\nFollow Marc Levy on X at https://x.com/timelywriter.",

    "title": "China may have reverse engineered EUV lithography tool in covert lab, report claims — employees given fake IDs to avoid secret project being detected, prototypes expected in 2028",
    "description": "China has reportedly built and begun testing a secret EUV lithography prototype using ASML-style laser-produced plasma technology. Yet, despite generating 13.5-nm light, the system remains unable to make chips and appears to be years away from achieving a complete, production-ready EUV manufacturing capability.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nA secret laboratory in China has quietly assembled a prototype extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography system and is now testing it stealthily, which means that the country may be close to replicating the most advanced technology that currently exists on Earth, reports Reuters.\n\nThe tool was reportedly developed by reverse engineering existing scanners from ASML and is said to be on-track to make prototype chips in 2028. If the information is correct, then Chinese scientists have made numerous breakthroughs across multiple disciplines in just a few years instead of decades, a scenario that appears extremely unlikely. Further analysis of the report indicates that China's laboratory is far from completing the tool, meaning that the country is years away from making chips using EUV lithography.\n\nThe system was reportedly completed in early 2025 inside a highly secured facility in Shenzhen and occupies nearly an entire factory floor. The Chinese machine reportedly generates EUV light with a wavelength of 13.5nm using the same laser-produced plasma (LPP) method as ASML Twinscan NXE machines, not the particle accelerator-based steady-state microbunching (SSMB) method designed at Tsinghua University or discharge-produced plasma (DPP) technology developed at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), which might prove the point that the system was reverse-engineered or at least contains a substantial amount of technologies pioneered by ASML.\n\nASML's laser-produced plasma (LPP) method uses tiny molten tin droplets, roughly 25–30 microns in diameter, which are injected into a vacuum chamber at a rate of about 50,000 droplets per second. Then, a high-power CO₂ laser first fires a low-intensity pre-pulse at each droplet, flattening it into a disk-like shape, followed by a more powerful main pulse that vaporizes the flattened tin and creates a superheated plasma with temperatures exceeding 200,000°C. This plasma emits isotropic EUV light, which is then collected by a large multilayer collector mirror and directed into the lithography system's reflective optics for patterning silicon wafers. This process repeats tens of thousands of times per second.\n\nThe machine is reportedly larger than the original, but it is operational in the sense that it can generate EUV radiation. However, it has not progressed to make usable chips as it still struggles to replicate 'the precision optical systems' features by Twinscan NXE systems. Furthermore, there is no word about power of the EUV light source, a crucial parameter that defines whether a tool can or cannot be used for volume production.\n\nThe report clearly states that the Chinese EUV scanner cannot currently be used to make chips, but the Chinese government reportedly wants the first chip prototypes to emerge in 2028, two or three years down the road. However, a more realistic target is 2030, four or five years from now, which is a long time. Meanwhile, from the report, it is not completely clear what stage the Chinese team is at today.\n\nThe report does not disclose which specific components of the optical system are the primary bottlenecks, as the article groups them rather generally. In particular, it is uncertain if the alleged EUV tool struggles to replicate the ultra-precise collector mirror system coated with multilayer molybdenum-silicon (Mo/Si) stacks, illuminator optics (which shapes and uniforms the beam using faceted mirrors), or projection optics (a series of aspheric mirrors for 4X – 8X reduction imaging with sub-nanometer wavefront errors). ASML outsources the development and production of these components to Carl Zeiss from Germany. If the developers failed to replicate the collector itself, then the rest of the machine can hardly be called an EUV lithography system, as technically, the only thing they have is some kind of light source that they have yet to learn how to use. Yet, even if the developers cannot replicate illuminator optics or projection optics (suggesting that the collector itself is there), it still means they do not have even a poorly working EUV lithography tool, but rather a set of certain components.\n\nWhen talking about advanced lithography equipment, we must keep in mind that such tools rely on seamless integration of sophisticated light sources, advanced optics, ultra-precise mechanical engineering, complex control software, and specialized materials, all of which must function reliably within nanometer-scale tolerances demanded by modern chip manufacturing. The story has no word about the state of the mechanical systems of the alleged tool: we know nothing about the wafer stocker system, wafer stages, or reticle stages, all of which are crucial for operation and yields.\n\nTo put China's EUV efforts into perspective, the secret lab is not even close to building an alpha tool. For now, what the Chinese lab has cannot even put the light on a wafer, save for printing lines and spaces, something ASML's tool could do in 2006, about 11 years before the company shipped its first Twinscan NXE:3400B system meant for high-volume manufacturing. Of course, reverse engineering certain components can give Chinese engineers a speed boost, but it remains to be seen how significant this one is going to be.\n\nAccording to Reuters's sources familiar with the effort, the Chinese EUV tool was 'developed' by a team that includes former engineers from ASML and recent university graduates, who allegedly reverse-engineered the company's EUV machines. The secret lab was so stealthy that its employees were given fake IDs to avoid detection of their concentration in one place by foreign spies.\n\nYet, it is unclear how any engineers from China could reverse engineer an EUV lithography scanner, as the Dutch company has never supplied one to China and hardly taught personnel from China how to service its EUV systems that are not allowed to be shipped to the People's Republic.\n\nReverse engineering a machine that contains over 100,000 parts is a hard task that takes hundreds of engineers with knowledge of the matter, which is why the secret entity led by the Government of China hired not only former engineers from ASML China, but also former employees of the Dutch company from elsewhere, presumably from Europe, Taiwan, and the U.S. For example, Lin Nan, formerly responsible for EUV light source technology at ASML, now leads a team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Shanghai Institute of Optics that has filed eight EUV-related patents in just 18 months. Yet, this may mean that he uses his experience and knowledge rather than trying to replicate what he did at ASML or reverse engineer what he did at ASML due to the absence of an EUV scanner in his lab.\n\n“It makes sense that companies would want to replicate our technology, but doing so is no small feat,” a statement by ASML published by Reuters reads.\n\nThe report says that around 100 recent university graduates are tasked with reverse-engineering parts from EUV and DUV lithography tools, with each workplace monitored by a dedicated camera that records the disassembly and reassembly process, an important part of the whole China's lithography program, according to the report. Employees who successfully put components back together receive bonuses. Yet again, a Twinscan NXE tool is a mechanism consisting of over 100,000 parts working together, not just a sum of all parts.\n\nTo sum up, China has reportedly built a secret prototype EUV lithography system and begun testing it, which suggests that the country may be closer to reproducing the most advanced chipmaking technology in existence than previously believed. However, details provided by the report indicate that China is still years — if not a decade — away from making chips using EUV lithography.\n\nThe machine can generate 13.5-nm EUV light using the same laser-produced plasma (LPP) method employed by ASML, which may demonstrate extensive reverse engineering of Western technology rather than the use of alternative domestic approaches. However, the tool is significantly larger than commercial systems available today, it cannot produce usable chips, and appears to struggle with other elements of EUV lithography, particularly ultra-precise optics supplied to ASML by Carl Zeiss. In fact, details about the system like light source power, optical subsystem maturity, and the state of critical mechanical components remain unclear.\n\nWhile China expects first prototype EUV chips to emerge in 2028, Reuters's sources suggest 2030 is more realistic. Yet, the whole effort relies heavily on recruiting former ASML engineers and reverse engineering parts from existing EUV and DUV tools, which are not only hard to develop, but are extremely hard to make. Meanwhile, there is no word whether the current team responsible for disassembling and reassembling components can actually make an ultra-complex machine consisting of over 100,000 parts work flawlessly to produce semiconductors in high volumes.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.",

    "description": "The judge ruled Tesla should have to suspend manufacturing and sales in California for 30 days, but the DMV stayed those rulings for 90 days to allow Tesla to comply.",
    "fullText": "An administrative law judge has ruled that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing that gave customers a false impression of the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving driver assistance software, a pivotal development in a years-long case initiated by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nThe judge agreed with the state DMV’s request to suspend Tesla sales for 30 days as a penalty for its actions, but the DMV stayed the order and is giving Tesla 60 days to modify or remove any deceptive language before implementing the suspension, according to multiple outlets. The judge also recommended suspending Tesla’s manufacturing license for 30 days, but the DMV stayed that order, too, according to Bloomberg News.\n\n“The DMV’s decision today confirms that the department will hold every vehicle manufacturer to the highest safety standards to keep California’s drivers, passengers and pedestrians protected,” DMV director Steve Gordon said in a statement. “Tesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue — steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve in California’s nation-leading and supportive innovation marketplace.”\n\nTesla said in a post on X that: “Sales in California will continue uninterrupted.”\n\n“This was a ‘consumer protection’ order about the use of the term ‘Autopilot’ in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there’s a problem,” the company wrote.\n\nAfter the 60-day window, Tesla can appeal the decision and should Tesla comply, the suspensions will be dropped. But it’s not immediately clear what steps the DMV wants Tesla to take, beyond telling the company to “take action regarding its use of the term ‘autopilot.’” The DMV did not immediately respond to a request for clarification, or to a request regarding Tesla’s apparent plan to ignore the decision.\n\nTesla has faced multiple investigations from the California Attorney General, the Department of Justice, and the Securities and Exchange Commission over similar allegations that its marketing around partial autonomy systems was misleading. The company has also faced (and now settled) a number of personal civil lawsuits over crashes involving its Autopilot technology.\n\nThe case brought by the CA DMV has been winding through the state’s Office of Administrative Hearings for years. The agency essentially accused Tesla of making customers believe that its advanced driver assistance systems were capable of high levels of autonomy. This led to overconfidence in the systems, the DMV alleged, which has contributed to dozens of crashes and multiple deaths. Tesla refuted these claims by saying its marketing was protected speech.\n\nA shutdown of sales in California, even temporary, could have a major impact on Tesla’s business as it remains the company’s largest market in the United States. A manufacturing suspension could also hurt Tesla’s business. While the company has constructed a massive factory in Austin, Texas (and moved its official headquarters to the same location), it still relies on its Fremont, California factory to make hundreds of thousands of vehicles, including all North American-bound Model 3 sedans.\n\nThe judge’s decision comes at a moment when Tesla is advancing its Robotaxi service test in Austin. Over the weekend, the company removed the safety monitors from its small fleet in the city. It had been offering rides to customers in the city for the last six months, but with a safety monitor either in the driver’s or passenger’s seat. Those vehicles are running a different version of Tesla’s driving software than what the automaker’s customers have in their cars, CEO Elon Musk has said.\n\nThis story has been updated to include information from the DMV’s press release and Tesla’s response.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 11 - Major automakers on Thursday urged Washington to prevent Chinese government-backed automakers and battery manufacturers from opening U.S. ​manufacturing plants, warning the industry's future is at stake.\n\nThe Alliance for Automotive ‌Innovation, which represents General Motors, Ford, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen, Hyundai, Stellantis and other major automakers, sounded the ‌alarm and said Congress and the Trump administration needed to act.\n\n\"China poses a clear and present threat to the auto industry in the U.S.,\" the group wrote in a statement for a U.S. House hearing on Chinese vehicles. The group also said ⁠lawmakers should maintain the U.S. ‌Commerce Department's prohibition on importing information and communications technology and services from China that effectively bars the import of vehicles from ‍Chinese manufacturers.\n\n\"No amount of investment by automakers and battery manufacturers operating inside the U.S. can counter a China that is enabled by subsidies to chronically oversupply around the world. This is ​a recipe for dumping that Congress and the Trump Administration must prevent ‌from happening inside the U.S.,\" the auto industry group said.\n\nRepresentative John Moolenaar, a Republican who chairs a select House committee on China, said Congress should codify into law the prohibitions on Chinese-connected vehicles that were adopted in the final days of former President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"In just five years, China has gone from a minor ⁠exporter to the world's largest auto exporter, shipping ​6 million vehicles abroad last year at below ​market prices that U.S. and allied automakers cannot match,\" Moolenaar said. \"With massive subsidies, control over raw materials and supply chains and a ‍predatory regulatory regime, Beijing ⁠has turned its auto industry into a tool of the state.\n\nHe also cited national security concerns about Chinese-imported vehicles and concerns that Beijing could ⁠disable vehicles with Chinese-made software or components in the event of a major confrontation.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in ‌Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
