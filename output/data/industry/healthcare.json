    "description": "Citi said it was overweight on info tech, healthcare, and financial stocks heading into the first quarter of 2026.",
    "fullText": "The investing playbook to follow in the new year homes in on three key sectors of the stock market, according to Citigroup.\n\nThe bank's investment research arm unveiled its list of sector calls heading into the first quarter of 2026, which included three areas it believes investors should be overweight in as the new year begins: Information technology, financials, and healthcare.\n\nBesides financials, those sectors have seen a stellar performance in 2025. The healthcare sector of the S&P 500 is up 17% for the year, while technology stocks are up 28% year-to-date, beating the benchmark index. The financials sector has lagged the broader market, up 6% since January.\n\n\"For most of '25, we led with a Growth cluster focus while frequently advocating a Cyclical barbell,\" the bank wrote of its portfolio based on its 2025 sector picks, which outperformed the S&P 500 by over four percentage points. \"Headed into '26, we focus on a better balance with Defensives. This is aligned with our expectations for fundamental broadening,\" it said of its outlook for the coming year.\n\nHere are Citi's areas of focus heading into the new year, followed by its top stock picks for each sector.\n\nThesis: Earnings growth among banks and financial services stocks appears to be holding strong heading into 2026.\n\nFor bank stocks in particular, profit margins look \"healthy,\" and the sector is flashing positive trading signals, Citi said. The bank pointed to the sector's positive Relative Strength Index reading, one gauge that measures whether an investment is overbought or oversold.\n\nThesis: The bank said it expects \"lessening policy overhang\" to boost investor sentiment across healthcare, referring to trends like uncertainty around drug pricing fading as more pharma companies make deals with the Trump administration.\n\n\"Revisions have turned positive and the growth outlook for '26 should begin to improve,\" the bank said of the healthcare equipment & services area in particular. \"Insiders have stepped up purchases while sells have declined off recent peak.\"\n\nThesis: Fundamentals across the information technology sector look strong, Citi researchers said, pointing to an \"attractive\" growth setup in the semiconductors space and positive earnings revisions in the software & services area.\n\n\"This is our preferred growth sector given good fundamental trends and revisions. Surprisingly, not all valuation reads are stretched,\" the bank wrote.",

    "title": "Healthcare VCs predict more AI transparency investment, private equity M&A, and a quiet year for IPOs in 2026",
    "description": "It's been a hot year for healthcare venture investment. Backers said they expect investments in AI cost savings in 2026, plus more M&A — but not IPOs.",
    "fullText": "It's been a hot year for healthcare deals — but some investors are predicting a shift in which startups will capture VC attention next year.\n\n2025 saw a welcome surge in healthcare venture funding as investors rushed to back top AI startups. Last December, VCs predicted huge funding rounds for AI scribe startups like Abridge and Ambience Healthcare; indeed, both Abridge and Ambience landed hundreds of millions of dollars in venture funding this year.\n\nInvestors also said in December 2024 that they anticipated a race for those startups to expand beyond AI health scribing into other product lines, like medical coding and billing. That pressure intensified in August, when medical records giant Epic announced it was releasing its own AI tools, including for clinical documentation, in competition with its closest startup partner Abridge.\n\nWith Epic in the mix and tech giants like OpenAI working on their own healthcare AI plays, VCs told Business Insider that they're expecting different profiles of healthcare startups to grab funding next year as companies focus on cost savings, securing patient and provider trust, and ensuring high-quality data.\n\n\"AI has diffused nicely for passive listening in clinical settings, and administrative simplification,\" said Dan Mendelson, the CEO of Morgan Health, JPMorgan's healthcare investing arm. \"AI now needs to show savings to payers by helping consumers make good choices and reducing the burden on clinicians.\"\n\nInvestors are also watching for more healthcare exits in 2026. Two venture-backed digital health companies went public this year: Hinge Health in May, and Omada Health in June. VCs weren't optimistic that 2026 would bring a deluge of new public healthcare companies, but they're looking forward to what many said should be an active year for healthcare M&A.\n\nThis year, investment surged for AI startups tackling administrative burdens for large health systems. AI scribe startups Abridge and Ambience Healthcare notched $5.3 billion and $1.25 billion valuations, respectively, while AI-powered medical knowledge platform OpenEvidence hit a $6 billion valuation with its own raise.\n\nMany such startups have expanded into coding and billing to help hospitals capture more revenue from health insurers. But in 2026, insurers could use AI to fight back, said Todd Cozzens, cofounder and managing partner of Transformation Capital.\n\nCozzens said that many insurers have already partnered with large organizations such as Palantir and Anthropic on custom AI solutions. Next year, he expects those payers to contract with more specialized AI platforms trained on complex clinical data, like providers are already doing.\n\n\"It's a zero-sum game in the end, but like with the nuclear weapons arms race, a lot of money is going to be spent here, and doing nothing is no longer an option for either side of the battle,\" he said.\n\nSeveral VCs suggested that the next wave of healthcare investment will go toward business models that prioritize higher-quality AI behind the scenes.\n\nSapphire Ventures partner Cathy Gao predicted a conscious shift away from \"black box\" AI models in high-stakes industries like healthcare, calling them \"uninvestable.\"\n\n\"The next healthcare unicorns will be 'glass box' platforms where the core product is the digital paper trail,\" she said. \"Any engineering team can build an AI that fills out a medical form. The real opportunity is building the governance layer that proves why the AI made that decision.\"\n\nLiam Donohue, cofounder and managing partner at .406 Ventures, said his firm has also been investing in companies focused on AI decision transparency and data quality.\n\n\"One of the obstacles that needs to be hurdled for AI to be more widely used in enterprise settings is absolutely the ability to go back to the source of why some process happened or why a decision was made. And there's a lot of infrastructure being built to do that,\" he said.\n\nAs insurers cut reimbursement rates for key services, investors are also expecting a surge in business models that prioritize lower-cost care settings and eschew point solutions, paired with AI to reduce administrative spend.\n\nNorwest partner Irem Rami said she expects a boost for in-home care models that incorporate AI agents. Mercedes Bent, cofounder and partner at Premise VC, is watching healthcare startups that aim to support patients across a chosen specialty, like women's health tech that assists patients from fertility tracking through conception.\n\nTech startups that actually provide healthcare have somewhat fallen out of favor with VCs in recent years. The costs of employing providers or running brick-and-mortar clinics can make it tough for those businesses to deliver venture-style returns.\n\nBut in 2026, according to 7wireVentures partner Alyssa Jaffee, \"tech-enabled services is coming back, baby.\"\n\nAfter 2021's venture boom and the subsequent funding drought, some tech-enabled services companies struggled to maintain their growth or hit their next milestone on slim margins, especially at earlier stages, Jaffee said.\n\nBut many startups that have made it to the other side have stronger businesses as a result, including durable relationships with key customers like health plans, she said.\n\nShe also pointed to Hinge Health and Omada Health's successful IPOs; both companies are tech-enabled service providers that sell to employers and health plans.\n\n\"We have a number of those companies in our portfolio that have really hit their stride. It's just a meatier business, and I think we're going to get a lot of interest from later-stage investors coming in to support those kinds of companies,\" Jaffee said.\n\nNorthzone partner Wendy Xiao said that she's now seeing some employers try out a few different tech-enabled services solutions in a given category, such as GLP-1 management, and test them against one another.\n\nContracting with multiple companies could be a tough sell for employers who are already seeing their healthcare costs skyrocket. But Xiao said many of these startups are paid a portion of the money they save employers — a model that dramatically lowers employers' financial exposure.\n\nThere are a few healthcare companies that could be eyeing the exits next year. Virta Health has publicly said it expects to be IPO-ready in 2026. And Business Insider previously reported that two private-equity-backed healthtech companies, Zelis Healthcare and Ensemble Health, have been in talks with bankers about potential IPOs.\n\nStill, no reports have emerged of venture-backed healthcare startups filing their S-1s. By this time last year, Hinge Health and Omada Health were already deep into their IPO preparations.\n\nWhile Xiao thinks a handful of healthtech startups are waiting for their debuts, she's not confident they'll take the plunge before the second half of 2026.\n\n\"I think they'll probably go out in a similar timeframe of, if not late next year, then the year after. There seems to be a lot of momentum pent up around IPO readiness at the organizational level over the past few years. I think a lot of these companies are in pretty good shape in terms of that, and they're just waiting for one of the larger ones to go out,\" Xiao said.\n\nMichael Greeley, the cofounder and general partner at Flare Capital Partners, agreed that the new year is unlikely to bring a steady stream of new healthcare IPOs. But he's anticipating more M&A activity as interest rates come down and private equity buyers look for healthcare AI acquisitions in the VC world.\n\n\"A lot of us are still sitting on a lot of unrealized gains, and the obsession is going to be heightened around liquidity,\" Greeley said. \"We're seeing a lot more interest from the big buyout funds in our sector, who are going down market to buy AI assets to wrap around their legacy platform companies.\"\n\n2025 saw a few such deals. New Mountain Capital, in particular, made several AI acquisitions this year as the PE firm rolled startups onto its existing healthcare bets. Greeley also pointed to firms such as Bain Capital, TPG, Silver Lake, and KKR as potential buyers in 2026.\n\nDonohue is similarly optimistic that 2026 will bring a flurry of exit activity as more companies mull going public, selling, or merging with a competitor. In particular, he expects strategic buyers, such as health plans, to become more active in the second half of 2026.\n\n\"I actually think it'll be a good exit year. I'm seeing lots of signs of life, both within our portfolio and more broadly. There's a lot of activity percolating that you just haven't seen for the last several years,\" he said.",

    "description": "C-section rates at individual hospitals are hard to find. Search our map by hospital name, city, state, or ZIP code to compare facilities near you.",
    "fullText": "At Valley Baptist Medical Center in Brownsville, Texas, doctors performed C-sections on half of all women with low-risk pregnancies — first-time mothers at full term, carrying a single baby positioned head-down — on average, in a seven-year period.\n\nThat's double the low-risk C-section rate of the next closest hospital, less than 5 miles away.\n\nThe contrast isn't unique to the Rio Grande Valley. Across the country, neighboring hospitals deliver babies at vastly different C-section rates — even when controlling for factors like maternal age, health complications, and whether a hospital treats high-risk pregnancies.\n\nBusiness Insider spent months compiling C-section data from 29 states and Washington, DC, analyzing rates at 1,744 hospitals that collectively deliver around 70% of babies born in the US each year. The result: the first comprehensive, publicly searchable map of hospital C-section rates across the country.\n\nSearch by hospital name, city, state, or ZIP code to see C-section rates at hospitals near you. Click on any hospital to compare its rates with nearby facilities.\n\nHospitals change ownership — and names — frequently. Business Insider used the hospital name provided by each state department of health. Hospital names in our database may have since changed.\n\nThe table shows whether each hospital performs overall C-sections at higher, lower, or similar rates compared to the next closest hospital. Color coding indicates whether a hospital's rate falls above or below the national average for overall, first-time, or low-risk C-section rates in Business Insider's dataset.\n\nFor states that didn't provide low-risk C-section data, the map displays first-time rates. If neither metric was available, it shows overall rates.\n\nThe map displays three types of C-section rates for over 1,700 hospitals:\n\nOverall rates include all C-sections, whether a woman is undergoing her first surgery or has had the procedure before.\n\nFirst-time rates track C-sections performed on women giving birth for the first time — a critical metric since a first C-section almost always leads to more surgeries in later pregnancies.\n\nLow-risk rates measure C-sections performed on women with these lowest-risk pregnancies. Maternal health experts consider this the most authoritative metric for comparing hospitals, since these women are the least likely to need surgery to safely deliver.\n\nThe map reveals dramatic variation. Hospital C-section rates swing from as low as 4% overall at a hospital in Alaska to as high as 62% overall at a hospital in Florida.\n\nBusiness Insider identified 158 hospitals with average low-risk C-section rates at least 25% higher than their nearest neighbor.\n\nMultiple studies show that one of the biggest risk factors for undergoing a medically unnecessary C-section is the hospital where a woman delivers — even when accounting for maternal age, race, health, income, and whether a hospital specializes in high-risk births.\n\nDozens of obstetricians, midwives, and labor nurses told Business Insider that while C-sections are often lifesaving, concerns for maternal health aren't the only influences driving surgery rates. They cited fear of lawsuits, understaffing, and indirect financial incentives; C-sections are more profitable and cost-effective than vaginal deliveries.\n\nThe consequences are serious. Each additional C-section a woman undergoes increases her risk of severe complications like placenta accreta, a life-threatening condition that almost always requires a hysterectomy to prevent hemorrhage.\n\nNot all states have data. Many hospitals don't publicly disclose their C-section rates. Eleven states would not produce data identifying individual hospitals, citing confidentiality policies or saying they don't track the information. Twenty-eight states required formal public records requests, sometimes charging fees reaching $1,500.\n\nRead more about how Business Insider collected hospitals' C-section data here.",

    "description": "Henley & Partners say data shows wealthy families shifting plans as private healthcare costs surge worldwide and cheaper European options gain appeal.",
    "fullText": "A surge in global wealth migration seems to be colliding with an overlooked but increasingly decisive factor: the soaring cost of private healthcare.\n\nHenley & Partners, an investment migration firm, said its client data and new cost comparisons from a global health index show wealthy families are no longer choosing where to live solely on tax or lifestyle, but are increasingly factoring in the long-term cost of private healthcare.\n\nThe firm said in a press release this month that it has received applications from 92 nationalities in 2025, supporting clients across more than 50 residence and citizenship programs.\n\nApplications jumped 43% year-over-year in the first three quarters of 2025 compared with the same period in 2024, it said.\n\n\"Global mobility is becoming a core risk-management strategy for wealthy families,\" said Christian H. Kaelin, the firm's chairman. Clients \"are scrutinizing not only access to residence and citizenship, but also the real cost of sustaining that lifestyle — especially the price of reliable private healthcare.\"\n\n\"Destinations that look attractive on paper can become far less so once true healthcare exposure is understood,\" he added.\n\nHenley & Partners cited the SIP Health Cost Index 2025, from the SIP Medical Family Office in Switzerland, a global benchmark released earlier this month, which ranks 50 countries by the true cost of private healthcare using international private medical insurance (IPMI) premiums as of August 2025.\n\nIn Europe, the UK ($11,726) and Greece ($9,654) sit at the pricier end due in part to insurance taxes, it said. while Switzerland ranks mid-table at $8,912. The UAE ranks 10th globally, with an average of $9,680.\n\nSome of the mid-range markets include South Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Monaco, which range from roughly $7,100 to $7,600.\n\nKevin Bürchler, CEO of SIP Medical Family Office, which is behind the SIP Health Cost Index 2025, said inflation in private healthcare \"is rising worldwide, but the pace and pattern differ dramatically.\"\n\nSpeaking to Business Insider, he pointed to \"value\" destinations such as Italy, Portugal, and Austria, which offer lower costs and proximity to top-tier medical hubs like Switzerland and Germany.\n\nWhile ultra-high-net-worth individuals can absorb steep premiums, the cost gap matters for affluent families, especially those planning toward retirement, he said.\n\n\"It can make a significant difference whether you pay $30,000 plus for private health insurance versus $10,000,\" or whether \"a doctor consultation costs $500 or $50,\" he added.\n\nThat pressure, among other factors, is reshaping behavior, especially among Americans.\n\n\"US citizens were 5% of our client base in 2018, whereas today they comprise 40%,\" Basil Mohr-Elzeki, managing partner at Henley & Partners North America, told Business Insider — a shift he described as part of a broader hedge that includes healthcare resilience.\n\nHe said healthcare costs are explicitly cited in at least 15% of client decisions, making it a top-five factor behind geopolitical risk, global mobility, legacy planning, and tax optimization.\n\nInterest is rising in Portugal, Italy, Greece, Malta, and in cost-effective Latin American options such as Panama and Costa Rica, he said, adding that Turkey also attracts clients for affordable private medical tourism.\n\nMohr-Elzeki said many aging clients are increasingly seeking alternative healthcare options abroad — not only because of the cost, but also to access different medical opinions and treatments outside the US system, which he said, while \"top-tier,\" may have a \"commercial bias.\"\n\nHenley & Partners said the SIP Index is helping clients \"avoid hidden high-cost traps\" as healthcare becomes a central part of global mobility planning.",
