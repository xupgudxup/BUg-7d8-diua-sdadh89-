    "description": "As an American, living in Paris for almost a decade has come with many surprises about French culture, fashion, healthcare, and smoking habits.",
    "fullText": "Shortly after I turned 25, I asked myself: \"If you could live anywhere, where would it be?\" The answer was always Paris.\n\nGrowing up in the US, I'd taken French classes from sixth grade through college. The language and the culture were always on my radar, so I decided to take the leap.\n\nEt voilà! About nine years later, I still live in Paris full-time. Here are a few things that have surprised me about life in the French capital over the years.\n\nIn Paris, I rarely cross paths with people wearing sweatpants or leggings in public, which is a stark contrast to my experience in the US.\n\nMost people in the French capital seem to put effort into their appearances and dress one step above what I'd consider casual in the US, even if they're making a quick run to the grocery store.\n\nI see a lot of tailored trousers paired with plain sweaters and scarves. People also dress up jeans with loafers or crisp white sneakers and tailored jackets.\n\nIn the US, I had three fashion modes: going-out clothes (crop tops, jeans, and heels), athleisure (leggings, colored sneakers, and tank tops), and office attire (slacks, loafers, and silky blouses).\n\nOn Saturdays, I was dressed for either the bars or the gym. There was really no in-between.\n\nLiving here has improved my sense of style and helped me take pride in how I present myself. My new, simplified wardrobe consists of smart, simple pieces I can wear during the day and in the evening.\n\nI've developed a uniform of sorts, mixing trousers, jeans, white sneakers, silk maxi skirts, plain T-shirts, tailored jackets, and lots of black pieces.\n\nGetting dressed is easier with a capsule wardrobe — I feel ready for anything when I leave the house.\n\nWhen I was living stateside, it seemed I was always asked where I worked out, not whether I worked out. And I'd regularly go to the gym first thing in the morning.\n\nThough new gyms and studios have cropped up in Paris in recent years, the fitness scene doesn't feel nearly as prominent here as it does in the US.\n\nI joined a gym when I arrived purely out of habit, but I've since changed my routine. Lately, I go on a leisurely jog along the Seine a few times a week instead.\n\nMany Parisians I know walk a ton and lead active lifestyles, even if they aren't in the weight room at 6 a.m. Although I'm exercising less here in Paris, I've never felt healthier.\n\nThe first time I went to lunch with my colleagues in Paris, we stayed at the restaurant from noon until 2 p.m. Everyone ordered a three-course meal that included appetizers, entrées, desserts, and coffee.\n\nIn the US, I got used to grabbing a quick salad and inhaling it at my desk while working, so I had to adjust to this slower pace.\n\nI quickly learned that long lunches filled with conversation are very common in Paris.\n\nAs much as I appreciate this mindset, I'm not a big lunch person. So, I've started declining invites to avoid being stuck for hours at a time.\n\nBaguettes are a way of life here. Bread is a component of almost every meal and is meant to be eaten with the main courses, not beforehand as an appetizer as it is in the US.\n\nMost baguettes in France contain just flour, water, yeast, and salt. There are no preservatives, meaning they can go stale in a short amount of time. It's not uncommon for people in Paris to buy a fresh baguette every day.\n\nWith boulangeries selling them for less than 2 euros a pop, who can blame them?\n\nThe legal drinking age in France is 18, which could play into the mindset I've noticed surrounding alcohol here.\n\nDrinking is part of France's culture, and based on what I've seen, the focus isn't on getting drunk the way it can be in the US, where people can't legally purchase or consume alcohol until they're 21. Here, it's about socialization.\n\nOf course, I've seen my fair share of locals overdo it since moving to Paris (and people's drinking habits vary the same way they do around the world), but jungle-juice parties, drinking games, and vodka-soaked watermelons don't seem to be as popular among people in their 20s here.\n\nInebriation feels like a byproduct of drinking in Paris rather than its purpose.\n\nThe first time I picked up a prescription in Paris, the pharmacist took a pen and wrote instructions on the box herself. I thought I was on an episode of \"Punk'd.\"\n\nMy name and information weren't included on the box, and the only way I knew how much to take was by reading her handwritten cursive, which was in French and somewhat hard to read.\n\nIn the US, pill boxes tend to have all the relevant information — such as the patient's name, birth date, and dosage instructions — printed in giant letters.\n\nBefore I moved to Paris, I was aware of the stereotype that French people are big smokers. I half expected it to be false (as so many clichés are), so I was surprised to find that cigarettes are actually very common here.\n\nWalk down a busy street in Paris around noon, and you will pass dozens of Parisians smoking before lunch. Grab a seat at a café, and you will find an ashtray on the table. Have a drink with a friend on a terrace, and you may sit directly next to someone ready to pull out a cigarette.\n\nSmoking is prohibited in enclosed public places, workplaces, and public parks, so I didn't expect so many nightclubs to have designated-smoking rooms inside. I've also noticed that it's completely normal for people to light up at crowded concerts.\n\nI've seen plenty of locals smoke inside at house parties in Paris (usually by a window or in a bathroom, to be fair), which I rarely, if ever, saw happen in the US.\n\nThe smoking here put me off in the beginning — partly because I have asthma — but after several years in Paris, it doesn't bother me as much anymore.\n\nThe most surprising thing about moving to Paris was the realization that healthcare costs significantly less here than it does in the US, where steep copays and premiums are par for the course.\n\nOf course, I knew about France's healthcare system before I relocated, but it was something altogether different to experience it firsthand.\n\nThe US has a mixed healthcare system that doesn't provide universal coverage, so it was quite a change to see France's social security, a government-funded healthcare system, cover every person who permanently resides in the country.\n\nEveryone in France contributes to social security, so it isn't free, but the healthcare system reimburses most medical costs.\n\nSince moving to Paris, I've rarely paid out of pocket for doctor visits and medications. If I wanted to, I could also enroll in supplemental health insurance provided by private companies, which some people in France do.\n\nI got sick in the winter of 2017 and begrudgingly went to the emergency room in Paris because I was having trouble breathing. If I were in the US, I probably would've avoided going at all costs because of how expensive hospital bills can be.\n\nWhen I protested the physician's request for chest X-rays (a force of habit, as X-rays can cost thousands of dollars in the US), she responded by telling me that it would be covered by social security.\n\nThat was the moment I understood what universal health coverage really meant.\n\nSince I've moved to France, I always do the tests and see the specialists as soon as I have a health concern. Here, looking after my health is not a luxury I have to budget for.\n\nThis story was originally published on June 27, 2023, and most recently updated on February 20, 2026.",

    "fullText": "Healthcare is draining Social Security checks, and the squeeze is getting worse.\n\nOut-of-pocket healthcare spending in retirement is mountains more than people plan for. Even including Medicare coverage and ignoring long-term care, retirees face sizable out-of-pocket costs for premiums, copays, and uncovered medical services.\n\nHow do medical inflation rates compare to Social Security adjustments?\n\nHow much do healthcare costs consume of Social Security benefits?\n\nWhy are Medicare Advantage plans less beneficial long-term?\n\nWhat strategies help manage rising healthcare costs in retirement?\n\nThese bills eat up roughly a third of a typical retiree’s Social Security income and almost a quarter of total income, according to a new report from the Center for Retirement at Boston College.\n\n“Retirees get this because they’re writing the checks now, but those nearing retirement need to realize that this is coming up,” Matthew Rutledge, an economist and the report’s author, told Yahoo Finance. “It's a rude awakening for people once they get to retirement.”\n\nFor about half of seniors, monthly Social Security benefits provide at least 50% of their income, and for about 1 in 4 seniors, it provides at least 90% of income. For 27% — 6.4 million seniors — it’s their only source of income.\n\nIn January, the estimated average monthly Social Security retirement benefit was $2,071, according to Social Security Administration data.\n\nFor women, those checks tend to be smaller. The average woman’s monthly Social Security check is roughly one-quarter less than the average man’s due in part to lower pay over their working years, time out of the workforce for caregiving, and more part-time work.\n\nThe bad news is that healthcare costs aren’t subsiding.\n\n“Moving forward, we're going to see really big portions of people's Social Security checks going toward medical costs,” Rutledge said.“The picture isn’t going to get any better anytime soon.”\n\nEven basic medical care early in retirement is expensive. “Medicare premiums have risen quite high, much faster than inflation over the last few years,” Rutledge said.\n\nIn 2026, for example, the monthly Part B premium rate is $202.90, an increase of $17.90 from last year. And the annual Part B deductible, which most people must pay before their Medicare coverage begins, rose by $26 this year, to $283.\n\nWhat’s more, medical inflation is projected to climb at more than double the rate of Social Security cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs).\n\nHealth-related cost inflation is expected to remain high with a projected long-term inflation rate of 5.8% (based on a 65-year-old couple retiring in 2026, with average health and national average costs), according to a new report from data firm HealthView Services. Social Security COLAs are projected to rise by only 2.4%.",

    "description": "Matt Rosenberg negotiated a $163,000 discount on a hospital bill using Claude for help — and says AI is giving patients more power.",
    "fullText": "The hospital bill arrived a month after the cremation. Eight lines of vague descriptions — cardiology, pharmacy, medical supplies — each with a dollar amount, many in five figures. The American health system's casual itemization of grief.\n\nMy 62-year-old brother-in-law had suffered a massive heart attack in June 2025 after running a 5K, barely an effort for a lifelong triathlete on most days, but this day, the trigger for a life-ending coronary.\n\nTelling his wife he was having difficulty breathing, he was rushed first to urgent care and then to the ER at Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura, CA.\n\nSix weeks later, the bill for the hospital's four hours of failed effort trying to save him: $195,628.\n\nMy sister-in-law's first instinct was to pay it. The life insurance would more than cover it. I told her to wait — to email me everything and sign nothing until we understood what we were looking at. The American healthcare system counts on people in grief making quick decisions. We weren't going to be those people.\n\nMy brother-in-law hadn't been uninsured by circumstance but by miscalculation — he'd let his policy lapse while shopping for something cheaper. When you regularly bike 10 miles before breakfast, re-upping health insurance feels less urgent than it should. The heart attack had come before he'd set up a new policy.\n\nThe first lesson in medical billing is that hospitals speak in tongues. That initial bill was too vague — categories rather than procedures.\n\nWhen I requested an itemized version, what arrived was a longer list of internal codes with prices — codes that existed only within the hospital's accounting system, opaque as an inside joke.\n\nAs a former ad agency guy, I've been trained in negotiation. The first task is to define the playing field, a reasonable starting point in response to their $195K gambit.\n\nMy strategy was to figure out what an insurer would've paid for identical services. Medicare is the country's largest healthcare payer, so I'd start there.\n\nAfter two requests via phone, the hospital sent a UB-04 form — the same coded document they'd submit to Medicare or Blue Cross. I prepared to do what seemed straightforward: look up Medicare payments for each code, create a spreadsheet, and build our negotiating position on the radical proposition that the uninsured shouldn't pay more than the insured.\n\nThere were a lot of codes. I took a shortcut and went to my AI assistant, Anthropic's Claude, which I typically use for research and to understand how AI intersects with our lives, for good or ill.\n\n\"Make a spreadsheet with these CPT codes and research what Medicare pays for each one,\" I typed. \"Flag anything that needs further research.\"\n\nClaude responded with questions: Which insurance type? Which geographic location? Which year? I'd thought Medicare rates were just Medicare rates. Lesson no. 2.\n\nWithin a couple of minutes, Claude produced a spreadsheet. But it showed zeros for many of the codes instead of the dollar amounts I expected. In the notes column for these, it said, \"See 92941RC, C-APC comprehensive payment.\"\n\nCode 92941RC was a cardiac intervention priced at $30,767. I asked Claude to explain.\n\nClaude responded with the flat precision of a tax attorney: Medicare doesn't pay à la carte for complex procedures. When doctors place a cardiac stent, Medicare makes one bundled payment covering everything — the procedure, the catheters, the guide wires, the contrast dye. It's called a Comprehensive Ambulatory Payment Classification, designed to prevent exactly the kind of bill I was looking at.\n\nThe hospital had unbundled the procedure. After charging $30,767 for the main intervention, they'd added separate lines for catheters (around $20,000), guide wires ($3,565), and medical supplies ($77,400) — over $100,000 for items Medicare would've paid nothing for because they're already included. (A gift with purchase!) It was as if a restaurant charged you for the pizza, then added separate charges for the dough, the sauce, and each pepperoni.\n\nClaude found more ways that the bill my sister-in-law got differed from what Medicare would've received. The hospital had included a charge for a bypass, an in-patient-only procedure — you don't have a heart bypass in the morning and go home that same day. But my brother in-law hadn't had one; he'd never even made it past the ER/OR. They also billed for ventilation management, though Medicare forbids charging for ventilation when there is another critical care code.\n\nWithin an hour of back-and-forth conversation over details, Claude calculated Medicare would've paid approximately $28,675 instead of $195,628.\n\nBefore explaining our position to the hospital, I needed to verify Claude's analysis. Large language models are known to hallucinate. I've seen them make things up in service of giving me the answer it could tell would please me. I couldn't take the information at face value.\n\nSo I fed Claude's work to ChatGPT. \"Check this for accuracy. Examine every detail. Flag any errors.\"\n\nMy logic: While each AI might hallucinate, two competing systems seemed unlikely to share the same delusion. And giving ChatGPT facts to check, I felt, would be less prone to sycophantic pattern-matching than asking it to run the same exercise — where there was clearly an outcome that would have pleased me.\n\nChatGPT confirmed the analysis. I then spent 20 minutes spot-checking on Google, reading the actual Medicare rules about bundling and inpatient charges. It was all there, but dense reading. I wouldn't have known what to look for without Claude.\n\nI drafted a six-page letter detailing each way the bill violated Medicare billing rules — the improper unbundling, the mutually exclusive service billing, the inpatient procedure on an outpatient claim. We offered to pay $28,675 promptly in exchange for a zero balance.\n\nWithin a week, the hospital countered at $36,356 without defending their initial billing. We split the difference at roughly $32,500. Three emails, a settlement agreement Claude helped me draft, and done. (I should note that as a former agency new business guy, I've spent a lot of time with lawyers and contracts and speak that language well — I don't recommend using AI as your lawyer.)\n\nThe collaboration with Claude and ChatGPT hadn't just saved $163,000. It had revealed the byzantine architecture of American medical billing — a system built on the assumption that patients won't understand what they're being charged.\n\nHospitals maintain \"chargemaster\" prices — fantasy numbers that bear the same relationship to reality as airport sandwich prices. No insurer pays those rates. They exist largely so insurers can claim massive negotiated discounts and so hospitals can report charity to maintain tax-exempt status. The only people who don't play this game are the uninsured. They get the unreal bill presented as real. Claude helped me call \"not it.\"\n\nThe opacity isn't impenetrable; it's just tedious. The rules exist, published in federal registers, available to anyone willing to decode them. The system counts on people not having the time, energy, or knowledge to understand it.\n\nHospitals have armies of billing specialists, coding experts, and lawyers. Patients have grief, fear, and confusion.\n\nAI changes the equilibrium. Not by being infallible — it isn't — but by making the tedious manageable. What would have been days of regulatory research became a couple hours of conversation, collaboration, and brainstorming. Where I had questions or found errors, Claude informed or corrected. Together, our strengths and weaknesses produced a winning strategy.\n\nNot everyone has the experience — but as these tools become more common, those who don't know how to use them will probably know someone who does.\n\nMy sister-in-law could've paid in full. She would've been among countless Americans who pay because fighting feels impossible, or go bankrupt because they can't pay and don't know they can fight. But she had someone to call, and that someone had Claude, and Claude could parse regulations hospitals hope patients are too intimidated to read.\n\nThe hospital that treated my brother-in-law wasn't uniquely unethical. They're caught in their own trap. But for the first time, the trap has a map — and the map is finally readable.\n\nMatt Rosenberg is a marketing consultant for technology, travel, entertainment, and advertising companies.

    "fullText": "With many unable to access or afford qualified therapists, AI is filling the mental healthcare vacuum, amid calls for tighter regulation\n\nOn a quiet evening in her Abuja hotel, Joy Adeboye, 23, sits on her bed clutching her phone, her mind racing and chest tightening. On her screen is yet another abusive message from her stalker – a man she had met nine months earlier at her church.\n\nHe had asked Adeboye out; when she declined, he began sending her intimidating, insulting and blackmailing messages on social media, as well as spreading false information about her online. There were even death threats.\n\nThe experience is taking its toll on her mental health, leaving her struggling to cope. Family and friends she confided in did not take it seriously, and she cannot afford in-person therapy or counselling. As the feeling of panic rose at the sight of his words, she turns to an alternative: a WhatsApp chatbot called Chat Kemi.\n\n“Good evening, Resilient Joy,” the bot types. “How are you today?”\n\n Adeboye hesitates, then starts typing: “Someone is defaming me online and threatening to kill me, because I refused to date him. I am depressed and confused. What should I do?”\n\nThe chatbot, which Adeboye had heard about at an event on gender-based violence run by an NGO, advises her to deactivate her social media accounts and provide all necessary information about the person making the threats to someone she trusts.\n\nFor the first time in months, Adeboye says, she felt less alone.\n\nAI platforms offering first-line mental health support have proliferated over the past year, with early trials in the US showing mixed results. In Nigeria, where AI has been embraced in many sectors and industries, a growing number of people turn to chatbots for virtual therapy.\n\nNigeria’s health system, including its mental health provision, has long been underfunded. Between 2015 and 2025, Nigeria has consistently spent less than 5% of its budget to healthcare, with 4.2% allocated for 2026, far less than the 15% target that African Union member states agreed to as part of the 2001 Abuja Declaration. It is not known how many people in Nigeria live with mental health conditions but, with only 262 psychiatrists in a country of 240 million people, most do not get adequate treatment.\n\nThe shortages have been exacerbated by the Trump administration dismantling USAID, which has badly hit services in Nigeria, especially at the primary level, having a devastating effect on patients in communities already struggling with HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and other health challenges. More than 90% of Nigerians have no health insurance, and now face uncertainty over access to services and feelings of helplessness over rising costs.\n\nPrivate healthcare is expensive; one therapy session can cost between 50,000 naira (£27) – the equivalent of a week’s worth of groceries. Cultural stigma remains strong; many Nigerians still associate mental illness with spiritual weakness or witchcraft.\n\nCommercial and nonprofit AI initiatives are starting to fill this vacuum. HerSafeSpace is an organisation that offers free and instant legal and emotional assistance to victims of technology-facilitated gender-based violence in five west and central African countries. Its Chat Kemi service is available in local and international languages.\n\n“These services don’t replace therapy,” says its founder, Abideen Olasupo. Instead, the chatbot uses a referral system to direct users and specific cases to mental health, legal or psychosocial professionals or organisations, should the need arise.\n\n“Our major objective is to support young girls, who are particularly vulnerable to gender-based violence, especially online,” he says.\n\nOther platforms in Nigeria offering similar services include FriendnPal, whose AI chatbot provides emotional support, matches patients with licensed therapists and includes mood tracking, psycho-education and ASMR tools to alleviate stress and anxiety.\n\nIts pay-as-you-go model gives users instant access to tailored therapy sessions that can include homework or assessments, according to Esther Eruchie, who created the service in response to the loss of her mother after years of depression caused by her 20-year-old brother’s death.\n\nAnother platform, Blueroomcare, connects clients with licensed therapists through video, voice, text and in-app messaging. It offers in-person outpatient and virtual care at partner clinics nationwide, includes a free wellness assessment, and charges between 5,000 and 51,000 naira for a therapist subscription plan.\n\n“Therapy was often too expensive, and there weren’t enough professionals to meet the demand,” says Moses Aiyenuro, who founded Blueroomcare after his own struggles with depression. “I wanted to build a platform that lowers the barriers to care.”\n\nThe technology used by these apps follows scripts written by licensed Nigerian psychologists and therapists who deliver care to users.\n\nIn Lagos, Oluwakemi Oluwakayode, a mother of four, started using FriendnPal’s chatbot after watching her eight-year-old daughter endure frequent seizures due to cerebral palsy.\n\n“Sometimes, it gave very standard replies,” she admits. “But I could finally say things I couldn’t share with my family. That alone gave me relief.”\n\nLater, the app connected her with a licensed therapist – something she says she would never have considered without AI easing her into it.\n\nDr Joy Aifuobhokhan, a Lagos-based public health doctor, says these platforms’ advantage is that they are more affordable and efficient than conventional therapy. “Digital platforms save time otherwise spent preparing, commuting and waiting [to be seen] at physical consultation centres,” she says.\n\nBut some experts caution that AI cannot provide the same level of expertise as a qualified therapist. “These platforms borrow from clinical methods like CBT [cognitive behavioural therapy] and mindfulness,” says Dr Nihinlola Olowe, a psychologist at Live Still Counselling Services, a Nigerian-based mental health practice.\n\n“They can be useful for coping, but they cannot replace the depth or judgment of professional care.”\n\nEruchie says FriendnPal has run more than 10,000 sessions in the past year, while Olasupo says HerSafeSpace has 1,600 users across three continents. Blueroomcare declined to say how many users it had.\n\nBut measuring the impact based on numbers alone is a challenge. “The real story lies in the engagement,” says Olasupo. “It’s exciting to see that users aren’t just using the app and leaving – they’re coming back again and again.”\n\nFor many patients, the immediacy and anonymity of a chatbot is key to its appeal but the ease of digital care could come at the cost of privacy. Avril Eyewu-Edero, a cybersecurity expert, believes that without introducing strong database protections in Nigeria, sensitive information – such as medical histories – becomes vulnerable the moment it enters an AI system.\n\n“If startups fail to prioritise privacy and encryption from the outset, adoption will stall. Nigerians are eager but wary,” she says.\n\nFounders of the services acknowledge these uncertainties, often highlighting their use of end-to-end encryption, unique codes that identify users or devices without including personally identifiable information, and strict non-sharing policies – even with government authorities, unless compelled by a court order.\n\nNow, medical professionals are calling on the Nigerian government to develop enforceable national standards for AI. Dr Alero Roberts, a public health consultant and lecturer at the University of Lagos’s medical college, says: “AI chatbots for mental health are an innovative solution, but without robust regulation, we are venturing blindly into potentially dangerous territory.\n\n“Robots can’t interpret human emotion as humans do. For people in crisis, like suicidal thoughts or psychosis, human contact is crucial. Someone, even a non-professional, can recognise the need for urgent intervention,” she says. “This is often lost with AI; strong governance is essential.”\n\nUnlike medicines or hospitals, AI mental health platforms operate in a regulatory grey zone. Nigeria’s 2023 Data Protection Act sets baseline privacy standards but lacks specific AI regulations for healthcare.\n\n“The main issue is enforcement, not a lack of laws,” says Ayotunde Abiodun of SBM Intelligence, a thinktank that provides analysis on political, economic and social issues in Nigeria and across west Africa.\n\nBabatunde Bamigboye, head of regulations at the Nigeria Data Protection Commission, a statutory body set up under the 2023 law, says: “Any use involving personal data must comply with the act. The framework focuses on data ethics, testing within sandboxes, and risk mitigation. AI in Nigeria is governed, but not via AI-specific laws.”\n\nIn Lagos, Oluwakayode continues to use FriendnPal. One day, she hopes to afford in-person therapy, but for now, the bot is her companion.\n\n“I know it’s not a real human,” she says. “But at 2am, it feels like someone is there for me. And that’s enough to keep me going.”",

    "description": "Moody's economist Mark Zandi doubts job growth will continue despite a strong January jobs report, due to healthcare reliance and AI risks.",
    "fullText": "The Bureau of Labor Statistics released a delayed January jobs report on Wednesday, beating economists expectations and showing the US economy added 130,000 jobs in the first month of 2026.\n\nMark Zandi says don't get comfortable with the upbeat data.\n\nThe figure is substantially higher than the 75,000 jobs that economists anticipated, but the Moody's Analytics economist isn't optimistic that the growth will continue.\n\nZandi has repeatedly warned that the US economy is on shaky ground, and could tumble into a recession. In a post on X on Wednesday, he said that the latest jobs data didn't do anything to ease his concerns.\n\n\"The job market remains fragile and highly vulnerable,\" he said. \"Yes, payroll employment increased by 130,000 in January, but given the big downward revisions to history, there has been no job growth since last April (Liberation Day).\"\n\nZandi also highlighted that almost all the January jobs growth came from the healthcare industry, something he doesn't think bodes well for the broader US economy.\n\n\"Without healthcare, the economy would be losing lots of jobs and unemployment headed higher,\" he told Business Insider. \"There are good reasons why healthcare is adding jobs, but it shows how vulnerable the job market and economy are if healthcare stumbled or even slowed its hiring.\"\n\nThat's not his only concern. Zandi also warned that a fragile labor market could be further compromised by the impact of AI, something he thinks is approaching quickly. While AI hasn't yet appeared in macro data, Zandi maintains that it is likely to change in the near future.\n\nThe economist added that he thinks rising layoffs will be the clearest indication that the labor market is starting to crack. Companies such as Amazon, Meta, and Pinterest have announced steep job cuts recently, and layoffs throughout the economy touched the highest level since 2009 last month.\n\n\"The best real-time measure of layoffs is weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance,\" Zandi added. \"They are running close to 225k per week, which is low. If they rise above 250k on a consistent basis, the job market is in trouble.\"",

    "title": "The 10 best states for retirement in 2026 — and the 10 worst",
    "description": "WalletHub ranked every US state on affordability, quality of life, and healthcare to determine the best places for retirement.",
    "fullText": "Retirement is full of decisions, and the state you choose to retire in could be the most important one.\n\nA recent WalletHub study pitted the 50 states against one another across three main categories — affordability, quality of life, and healthcare — to determine the best places for retirement.\n\nThe three factors were assessed using 46 different metrics. To determine a state's affordability, metrics such as adjusted cost of living and retired taxpayer-friendliness were considered. Quality of life included metrics such as the risk of social isolation, the mildness of the weather, and even the number of bingo halls per capita, while the healthcare category considered metrics such as nurses, dentists, and health aides per capita, life expectancy, and more.\n\n\"Retirement is supposed to be relaxing, but it can also be incredibly stressful given that it typically puts people on a fixed income, which may not be enough for them to live comfortably,\" WalletHub analyst Chip Lupo said in the study. \"As a result, the best states for retirees are those that have low taxes and a low cost of living to help retirees' budgets stretch as far as possible.\"\n\nWalletHub used data from the US Census Bureau, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other sources.\n\nSee the 10 states that topped WalletHub's retirement ranking, followed by the 10 states that ranked the lowest.\n\nWyoming barely edged out Florida for the overall No. 1 spot on WalletHub's ranking.\n\nIt ranked first in affordability, sixth in quality of life, and 33rd among the 50 states in healthcare.\n\nWalletHub also reported the state had the 10th strongest elder-abuse protections and the fifth-lowest violent crime rate in the US. It also has the nation's seventh-lowest poverty rate among residents ages 65 and up.\n\nIt comes as no surprise that Florida was ranked the second-best state to retire in. Florida's beaches — perhaps its defining feature as a retirement haven — give it the second-most miles of shoreline out of any state. This factor, along with others, earned Florida the No. 1 spot in the quality-of-life category.\n\nLike Wyoming, Florida's healthcare ranked in the bottom half of the report, at No. 27, but the state's relatively high cost of living wasn't enough to stop it from ranking second in overall affordability.\n\nFlorida just missed out on the No. 1 spot on the list, trailing Wyoming by only 0.01 points on WalletHub's 100-point scale.\n\nSouth Dakota has more to offer than just Mount Rushmore. The state ranked 15th in affordability and 25th in quality of life. Its healthcare was the standout, finishing at No. 4.\n\nThe state also had one of the lowest rates of seniors feeling social isolation, and the second lowest rate of seniors experiencing frequent mental distress, per WalletHub.\n\nColorado's rankings in affordability and quality of life were near the middle in WalletHub's report, each at No. 19.\n\nThe state made up for this with a No. 3 ranking in healthcare.\n\nWalletHub ranked Minnesota as the top state for healthcare for retirees. The Midwest state also ranked seventh in quality of life, resulting in a favorable combination for retirees despite the state's No. 33 finish in affordability.\n\nThough it may not be one of the first locations that pops into retirees' minds, Alaska's good affordability and healthcare rankings make it the sixth-best state to retire in, per WalletHub's report. And if you ask a local, the state's snow, ice, and short winter days might not be as intimidating as they seem.\n\nDespite these high points, Alaska's quality of life ranked 34th out of the 50 states.\n\nRanked seventh on the list, Delaware was found to be an extremely retiree-friendly state. WalletHub crowned it the second-best state in its \"taxpayer\" ranking, which led to its third-place finish in affordability overall.\n\nThe state also ranked in the top 15 in healthcare and had the fifth-highest percentage of population aged 65 and older.\n\nIt's for these reasons that retirees can perhaps forgive Delaware's 46th place ranking in museums per capita.\n\nAnchored by two major cities on opposite ends of the state, and with no shortage of scenic views and getaway opportunities, it's perhaps no surprise that Pennsylvania rounded out the top five in quality of life.\n\nThe state ranked 13th in healthcare and 26th for affordability.\n\nAmong all states, New Hampshire had the highest percentage of the workforce aged 65 and older and the second-lowest property-crime rate.\n\nIt ranked 8th in overall quality of life, 20th in affordability, and 23rd in healthcare, making it a desirable place for retirement.\n\nA ranking of 17th for affordability and 11th in the quality-of-life category meant Iowa closed out the top 10 in WalletHub's report. The Hawkeye state finished 28th in healthcare.\n\nAt the other end of the ranking, New Mexico was named the 10th-worst state for retirement.\n\nNew Mexico holds the unfavorable distinction of having the highest property crime rate in WalletHub's report.\n\nOverall, the state ranked 30th in affordability, 44th in quality of life, and 36th in healthcare.\n\nMeanwhile, Rhode Island had the third-lowest property-crime rate, but that wasn't enough to pull up its overall score in WalletHub's report. The state was found to be the 40th most affordable and to have the 39th highest quality of life.\n\nRhode Island's healthcare ranked in the top half, at No. 21.\n\nThough the report ranked Washington 17th in both quality of life and healthcare, the state was held back by its 46th-place ranking in affordability, largely due to having the fourth-highest annual cost of in-home services.\n\nThe state was also found to have the third-highest property crime rate.\n\nArkansas ranked just outside the top 10 states in affordability, at No. 11. It came second for adjusted cost of living and had the fifth-lowest annual cost of in-home services.\n\nHowever, it ranked 45th in healthcare and had the worst quality of life across all states, WalletHub reported.\n\nFor all the draws of the Empire State, affordability isn't one of them.\n\nNew York was named the least affordable state in WalletHub's report.\n\nThe state ranked 12th in both healthcare and quality of life, but these merits weren't enough to keep New York out of the bottom 10.\n\nHawaii may be one of the world's quintessential vacation spots, but retiring there is a different story. The state ranked 49th in affordability and had the highest adjusted cost of living in the US, according to WalletHub's report. On the plus side, it claimed an 11th-place finish in healthcare.\n\nOther special considerations, like climate and transportation, bring unique challenges to living in the state. As Business Insider's Ashley Probst reported, \"If you were to ask a born-and-raised Hawaii resident what they'd say to someone who wants to move here, a majority of the time their answer will simply be, 'Don't.'\"\n\nWest Virginia ranked 18th among all states for affordability — it ranked fifth lowest for adjusted cost of living and had the 3rd-lowest annual costs for in-home services, tied with Alabama.\n\nHowever, the Rust Belt state ranked 41st in quality of life and finished last in healthcare.\n\nMississippi ranked 49th in both quality of life and healthcare, contributing to its 48th overall placement.\n\nThe silver lining? The state ranked ninth in affordability, making it one of the most affordable states for retirees.\n\nThe fact that Oklahoma was found to have the lowest cost of living in the US wasn't enough to balance out its rankings of 31st in affordability, 48th in quality of life, and 43rd in healthcare.\n\nWith low rankings across all three categories, WalletHub found Kentucky to be the worst state for retirees in 2026.\n\nThe state ranked 34th in affordability, 42nd in quality of life, and 47th in healthcare.",

    "fullText": "Minister announces Microsoft, Cisco and Adobe to help apply AI to local schools, hospitals, GPs and businesses\n\nIn 2002 Barnsley toyed with a redesign as a Tuscan hill village as it sought out a brighter post-industrial future. In 2021 it adopted the airily vague slogan “the place of possibilities”. Now it is trying a different image: Britain’s first “tech town”.\n\nThe technology secretary, Liz Kendall, has anointed the South Yorkshire community as a trailblazer for “how AI can improve everyday life” in the UK.\n\nIn the latest move in Labour’s drive to inject AI into Britain’s bloodstream, the government has announced four US tech companies – Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Adobe – have agreed to help as the council pushes to apply AI to local schools, hospitals, GPs and businesses in Barnsley, an area of South Yorkshire which has struggled with unemployment and deprivation since the coal pits closed.\n\nThe town and its 250,000 people have been chosen because they have already adopted AI faster than many places, said Sir Stephen Houghton, the Labour leader of Barnsley metropolitan borough council. His authority has been using AI assistants for the last couple of years in adult social care and children’s services, and its bin lorries have been enabled with tech to scan roads for potholes. The parcel company Evri, which has one of its largest distribution hubs in the town, has been trialling robot dogs for deliveries.\n\nBut local opposition leaders have warned rebranding Barnsley as a tech town “might seem a bit of a leap” and highlighted local anxiety about whether AI is a force for good.\n\nThe “tech town” status means residents will get free AI and digital training, businesses will be supported to adopt AI, the hospital will test AI tools for check-ins, triage and outpatient care and AI will be tested in schools and at Barnsley College, all in an effort to improve pupils’ results and teachers’ workloads.\n\n“The economic basis of Barnsley was destroyed 30 years ago,” Houghton said. “This is the biggest opportunity we have had since then. The future of the economy is going to be in technology and for Barnsley to be at the centre of that is an incredible opportunity.”\n\nBut one area of uncertainty is the role of the tech companies. Houghton said: “The council won’t be paying them. Whether the government is, we have to wait and see.”\n\nMicrosoft already has a relationship with Barnsley College and, along with Google and Cisco, is understood to be working on a pro bono basis.\n\n“If we are going to get AI to work for Britain, we need Britons and British public services that can work with AI,” Kendall said. “If we can show that AI helps young people learn, supports local businesses to be more productive, and improves public services, then we can show what’s possible for the whole country. What we learn here will shape how we roll out AI across the UK.”\n\nMinisters have faced criticism over their handling of big technology companies. Last week the government launched a national AI training programme to upskill 10 million citizens, but many of the online courses turned out to be bespoke training for customers of particular companies such as Google, others cost as much as £525 to complete and some simply promoted the merits of particular company’s approaches to AI such as one explaining Microsoft’s “responsible AI approach”.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said hundreds of courses on the AI Skills Hub are free and where payment is required it is clearly advertised. “All courses are reviewed against a common set of criteria to ensure they are relevant, high quality, and delivered by eligible organisations,” they said.\n\nMinisters have also been challenged for holding meetings with tech bosses at the rate of more than once each working day. The government insists engagement is vital to create growth and transform services.\n\n“It’s not about giving tech companies access to data they shouldn’t be having,” Houghton said. “It’s a secure programme and we are not leaving ourselves open. But this stuff is not going away. We have to make sure we are smart enough to protect people while taking advantage of the positive stuff it brings.”\n\nHannah Kitching, the leader of the council’s Liberal Democrat opposition, said investment in the town was welcome but “there is a lot of anxiety among people about the use of AI and whether it is a force for good. We know it could be but there are darker sides as well.”\n\n“[Barnsley] is still really connected to its mining past,” she said. “Younger people see the jobs and opportunities around the tech town idea but older generations perhaps don’t. There is a job to be done to get people onboard.”\n\nResidents “want the council to get the basics right”, she said. Roads were “absolutely crumbling” and in bad weather bins did not get collected, she added.",

    "description": "Jordan Blake Banks, an American who moved to Finland, said the pay is lower but healthcare education, and childcare are much more accessible.",
    "fullText": "This is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with Jordan Blake Banks, an American and Finnish citizen who moved to Finland in 2019 for school and stayed to work. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was born and raised in St. Louis, then moved to Urbana-Champaign to study my bachelor's in agricultural and biological engineering at the University of Illinois. I graduated in May 2019 and moved to Finland about a month and a half later.\n\nI studied abroad in Spain, and really loved it there. It opened my world and gave me more perspective, so I knew I wanted to go abroad after I graduated. I was interested in bioenergy, and that industry isn't very developed in the US. After doing some research, I landed on Finland, which has a huge forestry and bioenergy industry. The Nordics, in general, also have a lot of English-language master's degree programs. Through a Fulbright scholarship, I moved to Finland to pursue my master's degree.\n\nI basically moved from one university environment to another, so in that sense, it was pretty similar. During my second year, I completed a research traineeship while I worked in a lab and wrote my thesis. After school, I eventually got a job in sustainability consulting at Deloitte, one of the Big Four consulting firms.\n\nIn Finland, you will most likely get a much lower salary than what you would make in the United States, but at least in my experience, it has balanced out. A lot of the things that are more expensive in the United States, like health insurance, education, and childcare, cost way less in Finland.\n\nFinland has a really good work-life balance in general. There isn't a huge culture of grinding, staying up late, and working long hours to get ahead in your career. The general idea is that the company and your colleagues respect you as a person and your personal time.\n\nIt's very common for people to set clear boundaries around work. A parent might leave in the middle of the day to take care of their child or have strict start and stop times because of family responsibilities. I really don't think that's seen as anything bad in Finland. Most people also take a month of holiday in the summer and time off in the winter. Even in consulting, the expectation to constantly work overtime just isn't the norm.\n\nFinnish is a very different language and probably the biggest challenge. Even though many international companies operate in English, in consulting, some projects are done in Finnish, and colleagues who speak the language are more likely to get those assignments.\n\nI eventually participated in an integration program where I spent months learning Finnish full-time. That experience really accelerated my language learning. Learning the language helped me feel more integrated in everyday life. I also don't think I would have passed the national Finnish language exam without it, which I took to become a citizen after meeting and marrying my wife here.\n\nOne of the biggest pluses is that I feel very safe here as a woman. Walking alone at night is something I would probably be very anxious about in many places in the United States, but in Finland, I feel pretty comfortable.\n\nAs a Black American living in a small Finnish town, that can be a shock if you're not used to it. In the smaller university town where I started, I did feel maybe a little bit more othered, but since moving to Helsinki, I noticed there was a lot more diversity.\n\nThere are also all of these different Facebook groups like \"Americans in Finland\" or \"Americans in Helsinki.\" I think it's actually pretty easy to connect if you're looking for a specific cultural group.\n\nPeople in Finland are not as open initially. In the US, it's very common to make eye contact, smile, or say hi to people you pass on the street. In Finland, it can feel like people are actively avoiding contact. I've heard many stories of people about to leave their apartment who hear their neighbor open their door to also leave, so they rush back inside so they don't have to make contact with anyone.\n\nThat can be a shock at first. At the same time, once you do get to know people, you can make good connections and real friendships. You just have to be willing to put yourself out there and be the brave American who asks for what you want.\n\nYou can also use it to your advantage, and I think it helped me land my first paid research job at the university. I was willing to make contact and be the \"brave American\" who asks for things.\n\nDo you have a story to share about moving abroad? Contact this reporter at kvlamis@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "AI health care is taking off in China, led by Jack Ma's Ant Group",
    "description": "Ant’s health chatbot has become a top downloaded app in China as users seek personalized care they can’t get from the overburdened hospitals.",
    "fullText": "Ant Group, Alibaba’s fintech affiliate and parent of China’s ubiquitous payment app Alipay, is racing to lead the country’s digital health market with a chatbot designed to be a wellness companion.\n\nIts app, Ant Afu, uses artificial intelligence and agentic capabilities to answer health-related questions, suggest hospital appointments, analyze test results, and remind users to exercise or take medication. First created in June under the name AQ, it had recorded 30 million monthly active users by January, with more than half of them living in small cities, according to Ant Group’s chief executive Han Xinyi.\n\nInternet users have increasingly turned to AI for everyday health questions and companionship, especially in markets where access to physicians is limited. Despite concerns about patient safety and data privacy, products like Ant Afu are widely embraced in China as consumers seek more personalized, round-the-clock health support.\n\nChina’s primary care system is underdeveloped. Most people seek treatment for everything from the flu to cancer at sprawling, overcrowded public hospitals that are concentrated in big cities. Patients often complain of long wait times, short consultations, and poor bedside manner of exhausted clinicians.\n\nThis demand for better care, combined with a fast-aging population, has created a fertile ground for digital health products that can spare people the burden of visiting hospitals. Tech companies including JD.com, ByteDance, and Baidu have all built online medical consultation tools, and more recently, chatbots branded as AI doctors.\n\nAnt has a unique advantage as Alipay has long hosted the appointment and payment systems for many hospitals. Millions of people access their national medical insurance accounts through Alipay. In January 2025, Ant acquired Haodf, a leading online consultation portal with more than 300,000 registered physicians.\n\nIn the U.S., AI companies are also expanding their health-care offerings, but they do not yet offer direct access to the country’s large number of private providers and insurers. This month, both OpenAI and Anthropic announced tools targeting consumers, health-care providers, and clinical researchers. Both ChatGPT and Claude now offer features that analyze users’ medical reports and fitness data.\n\nAmong its domestic rivals, Ant’s extensive partnerships with regulators, hospitals, and doctors give it an edge in the AI health-care race, Ivy Yang, a China tech analyst and founder of New York-based consulting firm Wavelet Strategy, told Rest of World. On Ant Afu, users can ask health-related questions, book online consultations and offline appointments at major hospitals, and get reimbursed by state or commercial insurance.\n\n“For startups, the bureaucratic red tape and initial investment required to build the platform, be compliant with all health-care data [regulations], and deal with various government agencies seem like too big a hurdle to overcome,” Yang said.\n\nAnt’s foray into health care has been endorsed by its billionaire founder Jack Ma. He came up with the name Afu, because it made the chatbot sound like a friend, chief executive Han told Chinese tech outlet Latepost this month. “He really cares about whether or not Afu can be like an AI friend that offers emotional companionship and humane care,” Han said, “rather than being just a tool for solving professional problems.”\n\nMa hopes to one day launch the app in underdeveloped parts of Africa and Southeast Asia, Han said.\n\nAnt has spent tens of millions of dollars marketing Afu in China, according to Han. Ant Afu ads have popped up in subway stations, on social media feeds, inside public restrooms, and have been painted on walls in rural China, according to photos shared online. By the end of January, Ant Afu ranked among the top ten most-downloaded iOS apps in China, according to Sensor Tower data.\n\nThe expanding role of AI in patient care, a largely unregulated area, has also prompted warnings about misinformation around the world.  A recent investigation by The Guardian found that Google’s AI summaries were giving out inaccurate health advice. Academics have also found AI diagnostic tools to harbor racial or socioeconomic biases.",

    "title": "Healthcare Workers Must Continue Alex Pretti’s Fight",
    "description": "Gregg...",
    "fullText": "Pretti was one of us. We have to carry on his struggle.\n\nIn 1964, a military coup overthrew the democratically elected government of Brazil and plunged the country into more than 20 years of dictatorship. One might ask why an epidemiologist like me would be interested in Latin American history at this moment. What drew me to that era was the key role that clinicians and public health workers played in the resistance against the dictatorship; their simultaneous push for a national healthcare program; and the ways in which this sector organized, even as more conservative physicians sided with the putschists, happy to see their more progressive colleagues jailed and persecuted.\n\nI’m not making one-to-one comparisons between our current predicament and what happened in Brazil years ago. But the insights of that time ring true generations later. Brazil’s medical rebels thought healthcare was a human right. They wanted it to benefit the public good, not private greed. And they saw themselves as equal to workers rather than as their social betters. That history also reminds us that authoritarianism, which Americans since the Red Scares of the 20th century have been told comes from the left, finds an easy alliance with the rich and privileged.\n\nWhich brings us to Minneapolis and the United States in 2026. The killing of ICU nurse Alex Pretti last weekend sent shock waves across this country, but it fell especially hard on people who work in health. The National Nurses United union spoke out directly on an assault on one of their own, but the grief was shared by everyone who knows the clinicians at our local VA hospitals or works on infectious disease research. For all of us, the murder of Alex Pretti has cut close to home.\n\nThere are plenty of clinicians and public health professionals who, like Pretti, have been appalled by what is happening in this country and to our communities. But there are still others who, whether because of their class or their ideology, either see themselves above the fray or have allied themselves with the current administration. Then there are the reactionary centrists in the field, more concerned with academic hippie-punching and attacking the supposed excesses of the progressive movement in public health than they are with fighting fascism.\n\nThe political economy of healthcare and public health in America is deeply tied up with the oligarchy of wealth. The authoritarian violence happening now is occurring in conjunction with a totalizing project from the far right and its corporate allies that, among other things, seeks to destroy public health and healthcare in the US and leave the carcass of what is left to the private sector to devour.\n\nDespite what the “can’t we all just get along” caucus tells us, merely pleading for an end to polarization won’t turn the tide here. We have to organize directly against the entrenched interests that have brought this country to the brink. This means, as Adrienne Maree has said, “Do we all share the same worldview?” isn’t the question we need to be posing now; we rather need to ask,“Is your heart beating and do you plan to live? Then come this way and we will figure out the rest on the other side.”\n\nThe fight for health for all, for clinical care as a public good, and for public health as a necessity is tied up with the struggle against authoritarianism in 2026. At this point, the threat is existential, and the coalition we need to build can include everyone who is not part of this administration’s techno-death cult. And this coalition is growing every day.\n\nFor all the sorrow and horror over what is happening in Minneapolis, the people there are an example to the rest of us. They are organizing to defend their city, but more importantly to care for each other. They are the antithesis of the rapacious violence that President Trump has brought down on them—an example of another kind of social organization built on solidarity and community rather than extraction and exploitation, the grift that this president personifies.\n\nWhat is happening in Minneapolis is partly spontaneous, but also deeply rooted in the expertise of activists there. Organizing is a practice, a way of life; it can be taught. Two weeks ago, I was at a gathering in Orlando, Florida, which was organized by the Emergency Campaign to Support Higher Education. The meeting was a training on the basics of community organizing with over 300 people, mostly students, in attendance from all around the country. For two days, we went through the basics of understanding and using power and public narrative, identifying issues that inspire, building a mass movement, mapping power, and developing campaigns. These kinds of trainings can be done all over the US—there are groups in every state that have the experience and expertise to take you through these fundamentals. Find them. Organize local trainings. Get skilled up. Learn the tools. Put them to use.\n\nThis leads us back to Brazil. Like the Brazilian doctors, who joined the labor movement and helped topple their dictatorship, we can build power by organizing and linking together with others, so that the chance to divide and conquer us, by stoking class and professional divisions, simply fails. This isn’t about just showing up to rallies and marches, signing petitions and sending letters—it’s creating powerful movements locally that can hold politicians and other decision-makers to account, to shape the future ourselves on an ongoing basis. Look to Brazil. Look to Alex Pretti. History shows us it can be done.",

    "description": "Virta Health CEO Sami Inkinen only felt like he “made it” once in 2008, when he was able to pay off $100,000 in debt. He didn’t own a car until he was 37, and is “happy with very little.”",
    "fullText": "When envisioning the CEO of a billion-dollar company, it’s easy to fall victim to the clichés: a well-manicured businessman adorned in designer clothes, jet-setting from one international meeting to the next, a team of assistants in tow. But not every entrepreneur enjoys the spoils of their success with a glitzy lifestyle—some are simply thankful to pay off their student loans.\n\nSerial entrepreneur Sami Inkinen has founded and scaled three different companies—including two unicorns—throughout his 20-year career. While the Virta Health CEO has built wealth thanks to his business success, he isn’t concerned with his net worth. In fact, Inkinen only viewed himself as wealthy when he was able to repay the $100,000 of student debt that was burning a hole in his bank account.\n\n“There’s one moment in my life that I felt rich. And then after that, I’ve never thought of money,” Inkinen tells Fortune. In 2008, three years after Inkinen cofounded real estate search company Trulia, he sold off a batch of secondary shares worth $500,000 pre-tax. “I had enough money to pay all my student debts. I was able to buy whatever I wanted, and it was a very expensive bicycle purchase, [and] furnishing my tiny apartment in San Francisco.”\n\nThe immigrant entrepreneur first made his foray into entrepreneurship with mobile software company Matchem back in 2000 when he was still living in Finland. After two and a half years serving as the cofounder and VP of business development, Inkinen sold the organization for a few million dollars, and uprooted his life in Europe to head to the U.S.\n\nThe Gen X entrepreneur attended Stanford’s MBA program, graduating in 2005 with an advanced business degree and $100,000 of student debt. Consulting giant McKinsey floated him a six-figure job offer, flush with a $10,000 signing bonus. It was a chance for Inkinen to quickly pay off his loans, but he skirted the opportunity and returned to entrepreneurship.\n\nFor the next decade, the entrepreneur helped scale Trulia into an industry staple, before Zillow acquired the company for a whopping $3.5 billion in 2015. Now, Inkinen is 11 years into his third stint as a founder, serving as the CEO of $2 billion healthcare business Virta Health. His student loans are squared away, bills are covered, and housing is fully furnished.\n\nInkinen will always remember the excitement of financial security he felt back in 2008, but stipulates the thrill was fleeting. It’s not in his nature to be “money-driven,” the executive says.\n\n“This feeling of money bringing happiness disappeared in less than two or three days. I was like, ‘Okay, well, it’s nice that I have no debt,’” Inkinen explains. “Money isn’t going to make my life or break it, and it’s not going to bring happiness.”",

    "description": "From gasoline and housing, to healthcare and credit cards, Trump touted his affordability agenda at Davos. The numbers are a mixed bag.",
    "fullText": "America's economy has never been stronger.\n\nAt least that's what President Donald Trump told the Davos audience on Wednesday. From gasoline and housing, to healthcare and credit cards, Trump framed his economic agenda as one centered on affordability.\n\nTrump repeatedly credited his policies for lowering everyday costs, and promised more savings in the future. But the reality is slightly different.\n\nAs Americans navigate a brutal job market and climbing cost of living, Business Insider dove into the data behind the president's Davos speech.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"The price of gasoline is now below $2.50 a gallon in many states… Soon it will be averaging less than $2 a gallon.\"\n\nWhat's happening: The average price of gasoline in the US was $2.81 a gallon as of January 19, nearly half of what it was during a 2022 high. Gas prices haven't been below $2 since the height of the pandemic.\n\nAs of January 21, AAA reported that ten states have an average gas price at or below $2.50.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"Homes are built for people, not corporations. America will not become a nation of renters. We're not going to do that. That's why I've signed an order banning large institutional investors from buying single-family homes.\"\n\nWhat's happening: Trump signed an executive order targeting institutional investors this month — but it's unlikely to have a notable impact on housing affordability. These investors only own 2 or 3% of family rental properties in the US, largely in Southern and Sun Belt cities.\n\nThirty-year fixed mortgage rates have been trending downward over the past year, though they remain relatively high. Average rent prices have seen consistent, steep growth over the last five years.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"The cost of prescription drugs is coming down by up to 90%.\"\n\nWhat's happening: The president is negotiating with some pharmaceutical companies to lower the cost of drugs and has launched TrumpRx, a government-run, direct-to-consumer prescription platform aimed at connecting people with cheaper medications. Trump's healthcare plan, released last week, outlines the administration's goals to lower drug prices and insurance premiums while maximizing transparency for Americans.\n\nEnhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies expired in December because of Republican opposition in Congress, leading to a spike in premiums for millions of Americans on marketplace plans. January data shows that, with rising costs, at least 1.4 million Americans dropped their healthcare plans between 2025 and 2026.\n\nWhite House Spokesperson Kush Desai told Business Insider that the enrollment decline is \"entirely a result of the Trump administration's commonsense measures to cut waste, fraud, and abuse and remove people who were improperly enrolled on highly-subsidized ACA plans.\"\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act also proposed changes to Medicaid, including stricter work requirements for enrollees and a federal funding reduction of $1 trillion over the next ten years.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"I'm asking Congress to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for one year.\"\n\nWhat's happening: Trump has called on Congress to cap credit card rates that have \"ripped off\" consumers. In the third quarter of 2025, the most recently available data, American credit card debt reached a record high of $1.23 trillion — a $24 billion increase from the previous quarter and a $67 billion increase from Q3 2024.\n\nThis proposal has received bipartisan support, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders pushing for a similar credit card cap. \"Trump even acknowledge the bipartisan appeal, telling CNBC's Joe Kernen Wednesday that the proposal sounds like something \"the mayor of New York maybe came up with.\"\n\nBank and business leaders are largely opposed, arguing that a 10% cap would prevent companies from adequately pricing subprime credit risk.",

    "description": "China faces a shrinking population and record-low birth rates, challenging economic growth and straining pensions and healthcare.",
    "fullText": "China's population is shrinking — and the decline is accelerating.\n\nThe country's population fell for the fourth year in a row, falling by 3.39 million to 1.405 billion people in 2025, according to new data from China's National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nIts birth rate hit its lowest level on record — 5.63 per 1,000 people — since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, while the death rate climbed to 8.04 per 1,000 people. The number of babies born in the country dropped to 7.92 million, down from 9.54 million in 2024.\n\nThe United Nations predicted in 2024 that China's population could fall as low as 663 million — less than half its current population — by 2100, if birth rates continue to decline and immigration stays low.\n\nIf things don't change, China's shrinking and aging population poses serious long-term risks for the country's economy. It could mean a much smaller workforce, weaker demand for goods and services such as housing, and mounting pressure on pension and healthcare systems. A smaller working-age population in China could also hurt the global economy, which has relied on China's booming productivity and economic growth.\n\nChina reported that its economy grew by 5% last year, meeting its official growth target. The country also logged a record trade surplus in 2025, despite President Donald Trump's tariffs. However, it's struggling with soaring unemployment among young people and an ongoing oversupply of housing, which has tanked property values, hurting consumer spending and slowing investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, and real estate.\n\nThe population of mainland China began shrinking in 2022, when it declined by 850,000 people after years of falling birth rates. That year marked the first time the country's population had declined since a major famine killed an estimated 30 million people during Mao Zedong's failed Great Leap Forward in the early 1960s.\n\nChina's demographic challenges have unfolded faster than the government once anticipated. The government has loosened previous restrictions to counter the effect, dropping the one-child policy a decade ago to allow families to have two children. Five years ago, it began allowing three children.\n\nIn recent years, the government has raced to lift the fertility rate by offering financial incentives to parents, tightening access to abortions, and, more recently, imposing new taxes on contraceptives, including birth control and condoms. There is little evidence these efforts have been successful at lifting birth rates.\n\nThough its situation is serious, China is far from alone in declining fertility. Birth rates are falling in countries around the world, particularly in higher-income nations, including the US. Fertility rates below the \"replacement rate\" of 2.1 births per woman are \"becoming the global norm,\" according to a report by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. This has sparked similar economic concerns about a shrinking workforce and a growing elderly population.\n\nThe US has a slightly rosier population forecast than other major economies, as it's set to grow slightly due to immigration.",

    "title": "Hundreds of America's rural hospitals have vanished. Maps show closures by state.",
    "description": "Rural hospitals are disappearing across America, with hundreds more under financial distress. It's leaving patients without care options.",
    "fullText": "Emergency rooms, maternity wards, and intensive care units are vanishing across rural America.\n\nThe phenomenon is leaving millions of people without access to medical services. Some now have to travel long distances for their annual checkup, while others worry paramedics won't arrive in time if they need help. Hospitals are major employers, and closures can leave hundreds of people without a job.\n\nThere are a few reasons why this is happening, and has been for decades. Smaller patient populations in rural areas make it difficult for hospitals to cover their operating costs, aging equipment and facilities can become too expensive to fix, and a change in ownership can tip an already-struggling hospital into the red.\n\nThis longstanding problem is also likely to get much worse — and quickly. Medicaid changes in President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act will limit key sources of federal funding to these hospitals, risking future closures. And the administration's $50 billion investment in rural health initiatives might not be enough to offset the harm.\n\nHere's what to know about closures in your area.\n\nSince 2005, 110 of the US' rural hospitals have closed permanently, 24 of which have shut their doors in the last five years. Researchers at The University of North Carolina found that the majority of these hospitals are in especially small and isolated locations, leaving residents with few options to see a doctor for preventive or urgent care. And many of these closure locations are near one another, creating healthcare deserts.\n\nNearly 800 more rural hospitals are currently at risk closure due to financial distress, the Center for Healthcare Equity and Reform estimates.\n\nSome struggling hospitals don't shut down completely. Eighty five rural hospitals have downsized since 2005, stopping all inpatient care while still offering some outpatient services. A formerly complete hospital, for example, might be repurposed into an urgent care, nursing home, or rehab facility.\n\nThis strategy saves money, but can come at the expense of patients. Over 500 hospitals closed their labor and delivery departments in the last decade, more than half of which were in rural areas.\n\nScaled-down hospitals are occasionally repurposed into rural emergency centers, which are designed to handle immediate trauma cases. These hospitals are stand-alone ERs and don't exceed an average patient stay of 24 hours.\n\nSince CMS began tracking it in January 2023, 42 rural hospitals have been converted into these emergency centers.\n\nAnd, while rural America is hardest hit by funding challenges, urban areas aren't immune. A recent report from the Government Accountability Office found that more urban hospitals closed than opened between 2019 to 2023, with many reporting financial distress and outdated equipment in the years before closure.\n\nBusiness Insider is diving into the business of hospitals and Americans' access to healthcare.

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Barbara Ford, an 83-year-old registered nurse and patient advocate for a healthcare company. Ford's husband worked into his 80s until some health issues led him to retire. This interview is edited for length and clarity.\n\nA nurse helps those who need help. If you have knowledge, you should share it. If you know how to do something and somebody is struggling, then lend a hand and help them.\n\nMy first job was working as a board clerk at the University of Rochester's hospital. I wanted to be a nurse, and I discovered that I could attend the community college and earn my registered nurse license. I can still remember the feeling of my feet flying through the air because this was my dream, and I was going to be able to do it.\n\nI was married with three children, 2, 4, and 6, and I was working full-time. I got my RN in two years and continued to work for the University of Rochester in pediatrics. As my children grew, I became certified as a school nurse and worked in schools before returning to the hospital.\n\nI worked my way up to assistant director of nursing at a community hospital, then moved to Virginia, where I spent a year working in an emergency room. I became the head nurse on the med-surg unit before retiring in 1990, but I never stopped working.\n\nAfter retiring as a nurse, I attended truck driving school and hit the road. We bought our own truck and leased it to a company in Missouri. We drove for them for 21 years, hauling government explosives across the country. He drove at night, and I drove during the day. We came home about 14 years ago.\n\nI went back to school for nursing for a year and went into hospice. Hospice was where I'd always wanted to be. I took the roundabout way to get there, but everything that I did on the way was preparation for it.\n\nI had to stop with patient care because of my age and balance. I didn't feel 100% safe with the patient if I had to lift them. I would love to go back to hospice care, but I guess all things come to an end.\n\nI was called to come into a health agency to assist with some office paperwork over a year ago. It was supposed to just be for a short time, but it turned into a regular job.\n\nSometimes, it would be five days a week, while other weeks it may be two or three. I typically worked from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., auditing charts and checking nurses' notes.\n\nNow, I'm starting a new job as a patient advocate for a healthcare company. I'll be working from home, and I'm really excited about it.\n\nWe have our Social Security income, which is the pay that was set aside for us to use in our later years. I also have a small retirement account from my time working at the hospital. Having some extra money makes it easier to go out to dinner.\n\nMy sister has been living in town here for the first time since we were teenagers, and we go out to dinner together once a week. I don't have to worry about how I'll pay that bill.\n\nFour were ours biologically. We also had foster children, and we adopted one of them. We helped our kids and our grandchildren as much as we could along the way. Had we kept it all to ourselves, we'd probably be better off financially, but I don't regret one single thing.\n\nIf one of them were to come up and say, \"I need some money for such and such,\" if it made sense to me, I'd find a way to help them with it. We don't need to be millionaires, but we just want to be able to do a little extra if we want to. There are many people out there who don't have that ability or that cushion, and I feel for them.\n\nPeople think I can't learn and have to be taken care of. I walk with a cane, but if I drop it, I can pick it up. I don't want to get to a point where I can't take care of myself.\n\nMy knees are pretty well shot. I've had one replacement, but not the other, and I really don't want to have to go through that again. I need some help standing up.\n\nMy husband takes care of himself, his own medicines, and everything, but he can no longer do all of the activities he used to do. He can vacuum a little, but he can't do any yard work. I try to do some of the weed eating, but we have four of our five children in the area who help out.\n\nIt just seems like such a wonderful thing not to have to get up in the morning, but what are you going to do for the day? Are you going to sit and watch the grass grow? How are you going to do something productive?\n\nSomebody asked me why I don't retire and travel. We did that for 21 years in a semi. We lived in a room that was the size of a good-sized bathroom, but that was OK.\n\nMy husband and I will soon celebrate 64 years of marriage. We have a good-standing relationship. He'll be 88 in February, and he just retired from the school system as a bus aide due to health reasons. Otherwise, he would still be working.\n\nMy husband doesn't want me to quit. He doesn't need me to sit around and stare at him. We're trying to keep our lives as normal as we can.",

A new study illuminates how extreme temperatures in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) are already responsible for a large number of emergency visits, and the trend could get even worse.\n\nA study led by the Australian National University (ANU), published in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health, found that from 2000 to 2021, about one in 15 emergency room visits (6.54%) in the ACT were associated with extreme temperatures.\n\nThe researchers project that the raw numbers of weather-related visits are expected to rise even further in the 2040-2061 period. They synthesized their findings in a press release and sounded the alarm for at-risk groups facing more extreme temperatures.\n\nThe ACT and its biggest population hub, Canberra, is an apt place to study. The region is known for hot summers and cool winters. From 2000-2021, winter was the bigger source of emergency department trips.\n\nThe researchers project that to flip in the future, with the biggest increase in visits chalked up to extreme heat. They offered predictions of up to 90,000 heat-related visits between 2040 and 2061, which is elevated from 36,000 between 2000 and 2021.\n\nAlthough the share of cold-related visits might decrease as winters warm, they're still expected to account for over 81,000 visits in the same period. That's up from just under 58,000 visits in the 2000-2021 time period.\n\nThe research shed light on how rising temperatures pose a major threat to public health and strain hospitals.\n\n\"This study shows that even a small increase in local temperature can make people unwell, and this intensifies pressure on our hospitals,\" said ANU researcher and professor Hilary Bambrick.\n\nExtreme heat can exacerbate health conditions like asthma and dehydration, and research also links temperature rise to increased suicide rates and drug use, per the Yale School of Medicine. Meanwhile, cold snaps can increase the risk of heart conditions.\n\nThe researchers pointed to at-risk groups in the various challenging conditions. Teens and children were vulnerable to same-day visits during very hot days. The elderly faced the biggest risk when facing extreme cold. Adults of all ages saw increased emergency trips on days with moderate and severe heat.\n\nDo you feel like the air quality is safe where you live?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nThese visits increase demand on health systems, which can be overstretched on the hottest or coldest days.\n\nThe researchers outlined a number of steps ACT residents should take during heat waves. They advised them to stay hydrated, plan outdoor activities for cooler times of the day, dress appropriately, and remain in cooler environments while specifically avoiding heat traps like hot cars.\n\nThey also urged residents to watch out for symptoms and reach out to others, including at-risk family members and neighbors, to see how they're doing during heat events.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Musk attempts to recast AI tool’s misuse. Plus, tech billionaires plot against a proposed California tax on their fortunes\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, US tech editor for the Guardian. Today, we discuss Elon Musk’s rosy depiction of Grok’s image generation controversy; the seven-figure panic among Silicon Valley billionaires over a proposed wealth tax in California, though with one notable exception; and how AI and robotics have revitalized the Consumer Electronics Showcase.\n\nThe firestorm over the Grok AI tool has been raging for more than a week now, and it shows no signs of dying down.\n\nLast week, I wrote about the rising backlash against Elon Musk’s Grok AI tool, which in recent weeks has allowed users to generate thousands of sexualized images of women. Some of the images show real women, some are fake, some are nonconsensual, and some depict children, all in “minimal clothing”, as the AI tool itself described them.\n\nX and its parent company, xAI, have taken some measures to curb the flood. The social network shut off its image generation feature for users who do not pay, which constitute the majority of X’s users.\n\nThroughout the controversy, Musk has obstinately recast the AI tool’s problems as everything but what they really are. He’s been promoting its popularity as if it were a piece of productivity software. He crows about its download numbers with dubious claims. On 10 January; he celebrated Grok reaching the top spot in New Zealand’s version of Apple’s App Store. (Rankings by the analytics firm SimilarWeb of the most-downloaded apps in New Zealand, which were updated the same day as Musk’s tweet, put Grok in 14th place.) The same day, he reposted a tweet about Grok reaching the No 1 spot in Thailand’s Apple App Store. (SimilarWeb’s rankings do not show Grok in the top 50 most-downloaded apps in the country.) On 9 January, he retweeted a post about Google searches for Grok spiking. (I would guess the increase in searches is evidence of great interest in the AI tool’s scandal more so than interest in using it.)\n\nIn response to the UK’s threats to ban the AI tool, he accused the country’s government of stifling free speech. After watchdogs cited instances of Grok undressing minors, he said: “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” handing the responsibility to moderate his social network to law enforcement and courts. “Illegal” is in a court’s hands and frees him from moderating all but the most heinous content.\n\nPerhaps to Musk, all press is good press? He may be right: his AI tool seems likely to accrue more users and few penalties as a result of the flood of nearly naked images.\n\nGrok has faced some repercussions: the UK’s communications regulator, Ofcom, has launched an investigation into xAI and Grok, and possible punishments could include a total ban. The Internet Watch Foundation, also based in the UK, announced it had found instances of child sexual abuse material generated by Grok in Dark Web forums. X’s revenue in the UK has plummeted by 60% as concerns over content moderation and brand safety grow. Both Indonesia and Malaysia have limited access to the AI tool in response.\n\nBut missing from the chorus decrying Grok are the two de facto smartphone regulators of smartphone software, Apple and Google, operators of the world’s biggest mobile app stores. Neither has indicated whether the Grok’s output violates their app stores’ terms of service. In the US, there’s been little backlash from regulators and lawmakers.\n\nThe lesson for Musk and other tech leaders seems apparent: the fewer restrictions you place on AI, the more shocking content you allow it to generate, the greater your engagement and your profit.\n\nTech’s billionaires are plotting against a proposed tax on their fortunes that may appear on ballots across California in November.\n\nVenture capitalist and antichrist evangelist Peter Thiel has already made a $3m donation to fight the proposal, according to campaign finance disclosures filed with the state. Other billionaires have started an encrypted group chat on Signal to strategize against it, which includes Anduril founder Palmer Luckey, Trump’s AI and crypto “czar” David Sacks, according to the Wall Street Journal. It’s called “Save California”. My colleague Dara Kerr reports on the division among billionaires:\n\nUnder a tax proposal that could be put to voters this November, any California resident worth more than $1bn would have to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state.\n\nSeveral Silicon Valley figures have already threatened to leave California and take their business elsewhere. But Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, whose net worth is nearly $159bn, told Bloomberg Television this week that he is “perfectly fine with it”.\n\nThis puts Huang in stark contrast with the Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, the venture capitalist David Sacks, all of whom have recently indicated they are leaving California for tax-friendlier states including Florida and Texas.\n\nUnder the proposed tax, Huang would pay roughly $7bn, and Page and Brin would pay one-time amounts of about $13bn and $12bn, respectively, based on their current net worth of $264bn and $243bn. Thiel would pay $1.3bn, based on his current net worth of $26bn.\n\nThe Consumer Electronics Show, held annually in Las Vegas for decades since its start in 1967, made global news this year. Nvidia and AMD chose it as the forum for major announcements on new hardware and software. Samsung announced a double folding phone, the Galaxy Z Fold 3, and Lego debuted a “smart brick” that seems quite fun as well. Robots abounded, rechristened as “physical AI”.\n\nIt’s been quite the turnaround for CES. For much of the 2010s, hardware announcements rarely made for top headlines. New DVD players or TVs did not make a splash. Smartphones dominated, and they all looked extremely similar. Apple, the most valuable company in the world at the end of the decade, even skipped it entirely. Now, however, Nvidia is the most valuable company in the world, and it chose CES to present what’s next. Artificial intelligence and robotics have breathed new life into CES. The themes and innovations that define the convention are broader and affect more industries outside tech than they once did.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I predicted that consumer technology would take many strange new shapes in the coming year, which seems to already be true as we view new developments in robotics. Humanoid robots debuted at CES, including one from Hyundai and Boston Dynamics. My colleague Samuel Gibbs dubbed a laundry-folding robot one of the best things about the convention.\n\nMeta blocked nearly 550,000 accounts in first days of Australia’s under-16s social media ban\n\nIran’s internet shutdown is chillingly precise and may last some time\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet hits $4tn valuation after AI deal with Apple\n\n‘Dangerous and alarming’: Google removes some of its AI summaries after users’ health put at risk",

They're more resilient to cyclical changes.\n\n\"It's hard to take a pause in hiring in that sector compared to maybe some typical business sectors,\" Ullrich said.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that employment of nurse practitioners, which ranked No. 3 on Indeed's new list, is projected to grow 40% from 2024 to 2034. The employment of data scientists, which ranked No. 10 on Indeed's list, is also expected to grow rapidly over the decade, increasing by 33.5%.\n\nBelow are the top 10 jobs and estimates from Indeed.\n\nRecent three-year growth in job postings: 15%\n\nRecent three-year wage growth: -3%\n\nRecent three-year growth in job postings: 8%\n\nRecent three-year wage growth: 26%\n\nRecent three-year growth in job postings: 13%\n\nRecent three-year wage growth: 6%\n\nRecent three-year growth in job postings: 0%\n\nRecent three-year wage growth: 8%\n\nRecent three-year growth in job postings: -32%\n\nRecent three-year wage growth: 20%\n\nRecent three-year growth in job postings: -17%\n\nRecent three-year wage growth: 33%\n\n\"Those that are in the top 10 that have negative postings growth have high values for either overall postings, wages, wage growth, or remote options,\" Ullrich said.\n\nRecent three-year growth in job postings: 11%\n\nRecent three-year wage growth: 14%\n\nRecent three-year growth in job postings: -2%\n\nRecent three-year wage growth: 10%\n\nRecent three-year growth in job postings: 39%\n\nRecent three-year wage growth: -5%\n\nRecent three-year growth in job postings: 34%\n\nRecent three-year wage growth: 34%",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - New York City nurses walked out of 10 major private hospitals across the city on Monday ​to demand increased staffing, funding of health benefits and protection from workplace violence ‌often coming from patients.\n\nMayor Zohran Mamdani, who is just two weeks into his term, joined the picket lines to ‌support 15,000 nurses that the New York State Nurses Association said were on strike.\n\n\"They are not asking for a multi-million dollar salary. What they are asking is for their pensions to be safeguarded, to be protected in their own workplace, to receive the pay and the health benefits ⁠that they deserve,\" Mamdani told ‌reporters.\n\nMount Sinai said that the union's proposals would cost it $1.6 billion over three years, with a $638 million increase in nursing costs by the third ‍year, which is 74% more than current costs.\n\nNew York State Gov. Kathy Hochul had declared a disaster emergency last week, allowing out-of-state and foreign medical personnel to cover for striking staff. The disaster emergency ​is in effect until February 8.\n\nOn Monday morning, dozens of nurses spoke of lack of ‌healthcare benefits and inability to take adequate breaks during their shifts as they rallied outside a NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in uptown Manhattan. NewYork-Presbyterian is one of three healthcare networks affected by the strike along with Mount Sinai and Montefiore.\n\n\"In the operating room, I work as a night nurse and we're always short on staffing and this is unsafe for the patient,\" said Michael ⁠Lazar, a 53-year-old NewYork-Presbyterian nurse.\n\nMount Sinai said it ​had secured more than 1,000 qualified and specialized agency ​nurses to cover for striking medics and to deliver care for \"however long a strike may last.\"\n\nNewYork-Presbyterian said all of its hospitals were open and continued ‍to provide services.\n\nMontefiore did ⁠not immediately respond to a request for comment. A notice on its website said that services would not be impacted by the strike.\n\nThe union and the hospitals held ⁠the last round of the negotiations the day before the strike, according to Mount Sinai and NYSNA. As ‌of Monday evening, there was no information about the next talks.",

    "fullText": "Dr. Mehmet Oz made the case that improving Americans’ health through better diets could transform both the nation's economy and healthcare spending.\n\nOz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, connected the dots between improved public health and workforce participation during a White House press conference this week. If Americans could stay healthy enough to work just one additional year beyond the current average retirement age of 61, it would “increase the overall GDP of our nation by trillions of dollars,” he said.\n\n“We will reduce healthcare expenses,” Oz said. “At the same time, we jazz up the U.S. economy with trillions of dollars created by the productivity of American workers.”\n\nFast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share\n\nSam Altman Says AI Will Transform the Economy — This Platform Lets Investors Back Private Tech Early\n\nOz praised the Trump administration's updated dietary guidelines, which encourage Americans to prioritize whole foods, proteins and healthy fats while reducing ultraprocessed food and added sugar.\n\n“The best way to reduce drug spend in America is to not need the drugs in the first place,” he said. He said that new guidelines could cut demand for expensive medications like GLP-1 drugs and autoimmune treatments by helping prevent chronic diseases from developing. “You can’t be a wealthy nation without being a healthy nation,” he said.\n\nHe pointed to data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services showing that roughly 30% of Medicare spending, about $300 billion a year, is directly tied to obesity. “If we were to affect obesity by 10%, which is an incredibly conservative and justifiable assumption… just that alone is $30 billion of reduction of expenses for Medicare,” he said.\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform Before the Raise Ends 1/19\n\nOz highlighted the importance of reaching children early, saying that 53% of U.S. children are covered by Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program. Programs teaching families how to implement the new dietary guidelines, he said, “will dramatically change the natural history of how children are able to participate in life.”\n\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said at the press conference that reducing healthcare costs requires upfront investments in education and access to healthy food. “The idea that a cheap meal made of processed food is cheap is an illusion, because you’re paying for it on the back end,” he said. “You’re paying for it with diabetes, with obesity, with illness.”",

    "fullText": "Anthropic is rolling out a major expansion of its healthcare and life-sciences offerings, as AI companies race to embed large language models more deeply into regulated medical workflows.\n\nThe company on Sunday announced Claude for Healthcare, a product that allows healthcare providers, insurers, and consumers to use Claude for medical purposes through HIPAA-ready infrastructure.\n\nThe launch builds on Anthropic's earlier release of Claude for Life Sciences, which focused on research and drug discovery, and reflects the company's broader effort to position its AI models as practical tools for regulated industries.\n\nThe move also underscores intensifying competition in healthcare AI. OpenAI recently unveiled a rival product, and startups including Abridge and Sword Health have attracted multibillion-dollar valuations as investors pour money into AI tools for medicine.\n\nAnthropic said Claude for Healthcare is designed to reduce administrative work and help both clinicians and patients better understand medical information. The tools are powered by recent improvements to the company's flagship model, Claude Opus 4.5, which Anthropic says performs significantly better than earlier versions on simulated medical and scientific tasks while showing fewer factual errors.\n\nAs part of the healthcare expansion, Claude can now connect directly to several industry-standard databases. These include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Coverage Database, ICD-10 medical coding data, the National Provider Identifier Registry, and PubMed's biomedical research library. Anthropic said these connectors allow Claude to quickly surface relevant information, support prior authorization workflows, and help clinicians and administrators generate reports more efficiently.\n\nThe company is also introducing customizable \"Agent Skills,\" including sample tools for streamlining prior authorization requests and assisting developers in building applications using FHIR, the modern standard for exchanging healthcare data between systems.\n\nOn the consumer side, Anthropic is rolling out integrations that let US subscribers on its Pro and Max plans give Claude secure access to their personal health records. New connectors include HealthEx and Function Health, with Apple HealthKit and Android Health Connect integrations launching in beta via Claude's mobile apps. Anthropic said data accessed through these integrations isn't stored in Claude's memory or used to train its models.\n\nAnthropic is also expanding Claude's capabilities for life sciences customers, adding connectors to platforms such as Medidata, ClinicalTrials.gov, and bioRxiv. New agent skills support tasks like drafting FDA- and NIH-compliant clinical trial protocols or monitoring trial performance.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "New data showed which sectors added more jobs than others in 2025. Healthcare had a lot of job growth, while the federal government lost a lot.",
    "fullText": "Friday's December employment report — the last for 2025 — reinforced the biggest theme in the job market last year: It's a hard time to be looking for work, unless you're looking at a few select corners of the economy.\n\n\"The job market is ending the year with a fizzle rather than a bang,\" Daniel Zhao, the chief economist at Glassdoor, said.\n\nIn total, the US added just 584,000 jobs in 2025, a big drop from the past few years. Job growth has been unequal across the economy, as growth in just a few sectors masks the weakness undergirding the rest of the economy. For those in healthcare and social assistance, prospects had been rosy: The sectors added more than 700,000 jobs together in 2025. But it's more of a reckoning for those in government, professional and business services, and manufacturing. Those three sectors were among the ones that had fewer jobs than a year ago.\n\nIt's a sign of how uneven the job market has become, and it shows why job searches have become so frustrating for many on the hunt.\n\n\"There wasn't a single month in 2025 where we added as many jobs as we did on average in 2024,\" Laura Ullrich, the director of economic research in North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said.\n\nHere are the bright spots and darker areas of the long-frozen job market of 2025.\n\nHealthcare continues to shine amid the general job market dreariness, holding strong throughout the year.\n\nThe healthcare sector accounted for 69% of the growth in 2025, with job growth of over 100,000 in ambulatory healthcare services, over 100,000 in hospitals, and about 84,000 in nursing and residential care facilities, reflecting that healthcare job growth hasn't been concentrated in just one area.\n\nIt's a sector that's likely to continue growing; in an August 2025 report, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projected that healthcare and social assistance would have both the largest job growth and the fastest growth rate out of all sectors. BLS chalked that up to the needs of an aging population and the rise of chronic conditions — all of which require more workers to take care of growing numbers of patients.\n\nLeisure and hospitality also added a good number of roles, although that sector tends to have quite a bit of turnover. Social assistance, however, remains a key jobs engine: After recovering in 2022 from pandemic-related job loss, the sector didn't stop growing. Individual and family services added about 289,000 jobs in 2025.\n\nWhile healthcare workers are still in demand, it might not be an easy job switch; many types of healthcare work require certain skills and years of education.\n\n\"It's not necessarily really easy for people to snap their fingers and switch from working in manufacturing to healthcare, for example,\" Ullrich previously told Business Insider.\n\nThe new report showed federal employment fell by 274,000 this past December from a year prior, which Zhao said meant the largest single-year drop since 1946, just after World War II. It's also comparable to the job loss in 1953, when the Korean War was winding down.\n\nThe federal government workforce weathered a lot of change in 2025: People were offered — and many ended up taking — a deferred resignation package to voluntarily leave their roles. At the same time, agencies like the Department of Education and the Small Business Administration moved to cut jobs, leading some workers to end up in employment limbo as the courts ruled on those layoffs, and others ultimately lost their roles.\n\n\"The president promised to right-size the federal government. What you saw is exactly that — a downsize of the federal government and a increase in private sector jobs,\" Department of Labor Deputy Secretary Keith Sonderling told Business Insider.\n\nMeanwhile, some other white-collar sectors experienced job loss last year. The professional and business services sector lost 97,000 payrolls, with employment in temporary help services falling by 99,200. That loss in temporary help services isn't as large as it had been in the previous few years.\n\nUllrich said white-collar softness could be due to businesses shifting investments to AI as opposed to head count, economic uncertainty, and overhiring a few years ago, leading to less of a need for new employees.\n\nGuy Berger, senior fellow at the Burning Glass Institute, said in a LinkedIn post that young people have carried most of the pain of a slow market. \"And not just young people with college degrees — it's also high school grads and people with associate degrees,\" he said.\n\nAaron Terrazas, an independent economist, expects this year to be a little bit easier for job searching, partly because employers won't be dealing with the uncertainty of what a new administration could bring.\n\n\"It's not that uncertainty has cleared up, but people are just having to make decisions because they have to be made,\" Terrazas said. \"We're going to see more investment, more business plans being laid, and ultimately I think that will lead to some degree of more robust job creation.\"\n\nAnother bright spot: Berger told Business Insider said he doesn't think the newly released report indicates a recession is on the horizon and instead lowers the odds for one in the near term.\n\n\"The labor market has cooled a little over the past six months — mostly via weak hiring,\" Berger said.\n\nInstead, the next year might just be slow and steady. \"The job market, in some ways, is like someone recovering from a ski accident — eventually you get better, but you never quite get back fully to where you were before,\" Terrazas said.\n\nAre you a job seeker with a story to share?

    "fullText": "In most healthcare organizations, AI adoption didn't begin with a strategy document or a formal approval process.\n\nIt began organically with individuals hearing about how AI could help them do their jobs better, easier. Who doesn't want that? So, they start using AI tools to summarize notes, draft communications, interpret documents, or explore ideas faster. Often with good intentions. Often without visibility.\n\nWhether an organization has formally approved AI usage or not, the reality is the same: AI is already in the workflow.\n\nThe real question is no longer if employees are using AI.\n\nIt's whether that usage is intentional, governed, and defensible.\n\nMany organizations respond to AI risk in one of two ways:\n\nNeither approach reflects how work actually gets done.\n\nWhen tools are banned outright, usage tends to move underground.\n\nWhen policies exist without enforcement or structure, teams are left guessing where the boundaries really are.\n\nIn both cases, leadership loses visibility causing compliance risk to go up.\n\nThe most common AI risk in healthcare isn't malicious behavior or reckless intent.\n\nIt's the absence of a clear boundary between sensitive work and external AI systems.\n\nIn regulated environments, invisible usage is often riskier than visible, governed usage.\n\nA compliance gateway is not about surveillance.\n\nIt's not about monitoring individuals or second-guessing intent.\n\nA compliance gateway is an organizational control layer that sits between employees and AI systems, making AI usage:\n\nInstead of relying solely on policy documents or trust, organizations provide a clear, approved path for AI usage that aligns with regulatory obligations.\n\nOne of the most persistent myths about AI governance is that it slows teams down.\n\nThey spend less time guessing, self-censoring, or avoiding AI altogether.\n\nGovernance, when done well, becomes an enabler.\n\nHealthcare compliance is rarely about eliminating risk entirely.\n\nIt's about managing risk intentionally.\n\nOrganizations that struggle most with AI compliance are often not the ones using AI aggressively. They're the ones who can't see how it's being used at all.\n\nVisibility enables informed decision making, targeted controls, and credible explanations when questions arise.\n\nWithout visibility, even well-meaning organizations are forced to rely on hope.\n\nAs AI becomes embedded in everyday healthcare workflows, governance will increasingly shift:\n\nThe organizations that adapt successfully won't be the ones that stopped AI usage.\n\nThey'll be the ones that made it explicit, governed, and defensible.\n\nEmployees are already bringing AI into healthcare work because the incentives are real and the productivity gains are tangible.\n\nThe choice facing organizations isn't whether to allow AI.\n\nIt's whether AI usage will happen outside of governance or within it.\n\nGuardian Health is being built as a governed AI workbench for healthcare teams: designed to sit between employees and AI systems, making data handling decisions explicit, auditable, and defensible. Our focus is less on controlling behavior, and more on providing clear, compliant pathways for real-world AI usage.",

    "description": "Shawnee Baker's daughter had catastrophic brain injuries and was kept on life support. She didn't have a healthcare proxy allowing her to die.",
    "fullText": "This story is based on a conversation with Shawnee Baker, a safety advocate for students and a former nurse from New Hampshire. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nOne afternoon during her senior year in 2017, my 18-year-old high schooler, Baylie Grogan, spoke to me in a serious tone.\n\n\"The only thing worse than dying is living in a body that doesn't work,\" she said. \"Promise me you won't ever let me live that way.\"\n\nIt was shortly before she left home to start college as a pre-med student. \"I promise,\" I replied, agreeing that such a predicament would be horrifying, and I wouldn't want it either.\n\nI could never have imagined that I'd have to fight to keep my promise to my beautiful girl, who sustained catastrophic brain injuries the following year.\n\nMy husband, Scott, and I had no say in the life-or-death medical decisions affecting Baylie, who was given a 1% chance of survival after being struck by a car.\n\nDespite being her next of kin, we were obliged to defer to the ethics committees of two hospitals because she was legally an adult at the age of 19.\n\nOnly we knew how much Baylie would have abhorred the idea of an incapacitated life of pain and isolation. Yet we had no voice.\n\nOur daughter had always been happy, considerate, and responsible. She was friends with everyone. Academically gifted, she planned to be a doctor. She wanted to help others.\n\nHer empathy extended to animals, especially her own horse. She'd go to the barn at 5 a.m. and spend hours with him after school. Her two older brothers and I would often call her in case she missed dinner.\n\nIn the run-up to graduation, she selected the University of Miami as her first choice of college, mostly because it had a renowned equestrian program.\n\nShe loved her time as a freshman and, after spending the summer of 2018 at our home in New Hampshire, studying, lifeguarding, and working part-time, she was ready to return.\n\nIn mid-August, we flew to Miami, where I helped her move into her dorm. We cried when we kissed goodbye. I was three months pregnant at the time, and she thought I might be feeling vulnerable.\n\n\"I love you so much, Mom,\" Baylie said. \"I love you, too,\" I said.\n\nIt was the last time I'd ever get to see the same kind, smart, vivacious Baylie I'd always known, the world at her feet.\n\nJust days later, on August 19, 2018, I received a call from the Miami-Dade police department. \"There's been a terrible accident,\" the officer said. \"Baylie is alive, but you need to come to Miami immediately.\"\n\nHe couldn't give more information over the phone and told us to contact the hospital where she'd been admitted. They said Baylie was in the OR, and the surgeon would call us as soon as he could.\n\nI was distraught and kept asking myself, \"Was she in surgery for a broken pelvis or broken leg, or something more serious? Did she hit her head?\"\n\nWe had a torturous journey south to the hospital in Miami, where Scott and I were shown to Baylie's room.\n\nI'd worked as a nurse in the ER for four years, and my daughter was, by far, the worst patient I'd ever seen. Her face was bruised and bandaged all over. Her body was swollen to four times its size.\n\nShe was on a ventilator, and her hair had been shaved off. There was a C-shaped scar on her scalp from the brain surgery and tubes coming out of her head. I ran to the bathroom and vomited in shock.\n\nThe police informed us that Baylie had been caught on traffic cameras crossing six lanes of I-95 on foot in the early hours of the morning. She'd been hit by a car after becoming separated from her friends on a night out.\n\nI tried my best to hold out hope, but it seemed pointless. Baylie's brain activity was barely detectable, and her pupils were unresponsive to light. They were signs of irreversible brain damage.\n\nShe was later transferred by plane to a Boston hospital that was closer to our home. The neurological team detected a so-called Duret hemorrhage in her brain, a bleed that almost certainly signals full incapacitation.\n\nWe knew that, in the 1% chance she survived, she would be in a persistent vegetative state — the scenario I'd promised not to allow.\n\nScott and I hit hurdles from the very beginning. We didn't have the legal right to request a toxicology report when she was admitted on August 19, which may have helped address our questions about whether she'd been drugged. \n\nBaylie had never completed an advance directive, healthcare proxy, or HIPAA waiver, which are available to adults 18 and over. Obtaining guardianship through the courts was likely to take months.\n\nWe were not allowed to see her medical records or make important decisions about her care.\n\nWithout a healthcare proxy or DNR order, she was repeatedly resuscitated by default. In hindsight, I wish we hadn't taken those measures, no matter how heroic the hospital staff was. Baylie was meant to leave us the day she got hit by the car, but her suffering was prolonged.\n\nThe ethics committees of both hospitals were there at every turn. Appointed to make decisions on Baylie's behalf, it was up to strangers — not us — to judge whether her quality of life justified being taken off life support.\n\nI felt not only grief, but also frustration about letting Baylie down. We were powerless, despite the knowledge that our daughter would hate the semblance of a life under 24-hour supervision in a long-term care facility, unable to open her eyes, feed herself, or recognize her family.\n\nShe had a functional MRI, and the committee decided to interview 10 people who knew Baylie well. The members asked them if she would want to suffer under those conditions. Everyone said no.\n\nThere was more back and forth, but we finally heard that Baylie could be moved to palliative care on September 24. It was unbearable, but she died with dignity and without suffering on September 27. I'd kept my promise.\n\nThe last seven years have been hard. I miss Baylie every day. I gave birth to Baylie's little sister, Savannah, in 2019, and her youngest sibling, Seraphina, two years later. They have brought much joy and laughter.\n\nWe vowed to honor Baylie's memory and founded Baylie's Wish Foundation. It advises students to take a few minutes to complete documents, such as healthcare proxies and HIPAA waivers, so that their loved ones can respect their wishes if a medical crisis were to happen.\n\nYou can download relevant forms for each state from our website for free. We want colleges to automatically include them in the paperwork sent to incoming students.\n\nI know that Baylie would be proud of the campaign in her name. She wanted to help people. We're seeing that through.\n\nEditor's note: Business Insider contacted the hospitals that treated Baylie Grogan and is awaiting a response.",

    "description": "Nearly 16,000 nurses set to join union-led strike Monday to demand large hospitals across NYC ‘put patients over profit’",
    "fullText": "Nearly 16,000 nurses in New York City are set to strike on Monday amid a battle over pay during contract negotiations.\n\nThe action, due to take place across five large hospitals, is being organized by the New York State Nurses Association (NYSNA), which is demanding the hospitals put patients over profit.\n\nThe hospitals insist they continue to bargain in good faith, and have accused the union of trying to disrupt patient care.\n\nCEO compensation at three hospitals – Montefiore, Mount Sinai, and New York Presbyterian – is nearly 12,000 times more than that of the average nurse, according to the union.\n\nNancy Hagans, president of NYSNA, who has worked at Maimonides medical center in Brooklyn for over 30 years, told the Guardian that the hospitals are pushing to scale back safe staffing ratios, refusing to guarantee healthcare benefit coverage for nurses, and declining to address workplace safety issues.\n\nThree of the major hospitals involved in contract negotiations have $1.6bn cash or cash equivalent on hand, according to the union, which said they have already started hiring travel nurses to replace those striking in preparation for a strike.\n\n“What we are asking them is to take those millions and invest it into the community so we could continue to work to care for our patients, invest it into staffing, invest those millions into our medical coverage so we could come to work,” said Hagans. “We’re not taking this lightly. We’re not asking to strike. Management is the one who’s telling us that we need to strike. They are the ones putting us on the picket line.”\n\nShe cited safety issues that stem from a drastic increase of assaults on healthcare workers since the Covid-19 pandemic, and an active shooter incident at Mount Sinai last November, where three nurses were reportedly disciplined for speaking out afterwards.\n\n“The large, wealthy hospitals are much better off financially than they were three years ago, but yet they’re asking for takeaways,” claimed Hagans. “They told us to choose between our wages or keeping our healthcare and safe staffing, because we cannot have it all. The safety of a patient should never be a bargaining chip. Nurses will not cut corners on patients and their safety. Nurses are just demanding that New York City private hospitals put patients over profit.”\n\nNurses represented by NYSNA issued 10-day strike notices on 2 January at a string of New York hospitals. On Tuesday, seven of the smaller hospitals moved forward in contract negotiations, with the union rescinding their strike notice.\n\nAbout 1,000 nurses at three Northwell hospitals in Long Island have also issued strike notices.\n\n“Our nurses have been at the bargaining table since September 2025 with little to no movement,” said Simone Way, a member of the NYSNA executive committee, and a nurse at Mount Sinai Morningside hospital. “Even though we started this process in September, there have been committees in the hospital having these same discussions on staffing since January 2025, so it’s no surprise to our management the things nurses feel we need.”\n\nWay also criticized hospital management’s efforts to blame the strike on nurses, claiming they are putting patients at risk and asking for too much. “They do have the money, but they don’t appear to be willing to invest that money in their nurses or into the ability for us to provide the best care humanly possible to our patients,” she said.\n\nMount Sinai denied retaliation claims against nurses following November’s active-shooter incident, and denied attempting to take away healthcare benefits for nurses. A spokesperson said: “We are continuing to bargain in good faith in the hopes of reaching an agreement that is fair, reasonable, and responsible, but unfortunately just a week before a potential strike NYSNA has refused to move off of its extreme economic proposals that demand hospitals like ours spend billions of dollars on increased nursing compensation and additional hires.”\n\nThey claimed “most of the union’s claims about bargaining are untrue”, and confirmed that the hospital is taking steps to prepare in case of a strike.\n\nNew York Presbyterian blamed the union for not budging on wages. “NYSNA’s threatened strike is intended to disrupt patient care across the city,” a spokesperson said. “We have taken the necessary steps to ensure that our patients will continue to receive safe, exceptional care. We will always meet our fundamental obligation to the communities we serve.”\n\nMontefiore did not respond to requests for comment.",

The company promises to answer patient phone calls, handle scheduling and refills — and cut down the hours of grunt work that comes with a medical visit.\n\nTivara has raised a $3.6 million seed round, backed by Plaid CEO Zach Perret's Mischief VC, Day One Ventures, Y Combinator, and healthcare industry angel investors.\n\nBefore cofounding Tivara, Seelamsetty worked as head of growth for Fair Square, a technology-enabled Medicare brokerage.\n\n\"I saw a ton of back-and-forth between beneficiaries and insurance carriers,\" he said. \"There's just a ton of paper-pushing.\"\n\nSeelamsetty met his cofounder while studying computer science at Washington University in St. Louis.

    "fullText": "State residents worth more than $1bn could face one-off, 5% tax to help fund education, food assistance and healthcare\n\nA battle is brewing in California over a plan to tax billionaires – with tech titans divided over whether they should pay up, or flee the state.\n\nUnder a tax proposal that could be put to voters this November, any California resident worth more than $1bn would have to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state.\n\nSeveral Silicon Valley figures have already threatened to leave California and take their business elsewhere. But Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia whose net worth is nearly $159bn, told Bloomberg Television this week that he is “perfectly fine with it”.\n\n“We chose to live in Silicon Valley,” Huang said. “And whatever taxes I guess they would like to apply, so be it.”\n\nThis puts Huang in stark contrast with Google co-founder Larry Page, Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, the venture capitalist David Sacks, all of whom have recently indicated they’re leaving California for tax-friendlier states including Florida and Texas.\n\nThe tax proposal is being led by the labor union Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West. If passed, the tax would retroactively apply to residents as of 1 January, and billionaires would have five years to pay it.\n\nThis means Huang would pay roughly $7bn and Page and Thiel would pay one-time amounts of about $13bn and $1.3bn, respectively, based on their current net worth.\n\n“What remains undeniable is the underlying unfairness of the current system,” Suzanne Jimenez, the chief of staff for SEIU-UHW, said in an email. “Regular working people pay higher effective tax rates than the wealthiest Americans … Asking those who have benefited most from the economy to contribute more – particularly to stabilize health care systems under direct threat – is a reasonable step.”\n\nThe proposal is still in the beginning phases. Under California law, it needs to collect 874,641 signatures to qualify for the state ballot in November. It would also need to be signed by California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, who has said he opposes the wealth tax.\n\n“You can’t isolate yourself from the 49 others,” Newsom said when asked about wealth taxes during the New York Times DealBook Summit last month. “We’re in a competitive environment.”\n\nThis puts Newsom at odds with Ro Khanna, the California representative who represents Silicon Valley and who has championed the idea of a wealth tax. Khanna says tech billionaires will likely stay in the state, despite a tax, because California is where the larger industry, innovation and talent pool are located. “A billionaire tax is good for American innovation,” Khanna said, adding that it would spread the wealth to other sectors.\n\nWhen Thiel indicated he was leaving California because of the proposed tax, Khanna posted to X: “I echo what FDR said with sarcasm of economic royalists when they threatened to leave, ‘I will miss them very much.’”\n\nThis is not California’s first billionaire exodus. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, famously departed for Texas in 2020, which stood to save him millions in taxes. He has also shifted several of his companies’ headquarters there. Most recently, in 2024, Musk announced he was moving SpaceX to Texas because of a California law that aimed to protect transgender children in schools. He called the law a “final straw”.\n\nOther tech billionaires have also decamped to Texas, which has no state income tax. Citing a better tax environment, Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale moved to Austin in 2020, and Larry Ellison transitioned Oracle’s headquarters there in 2020 (he has since said he’s moving the company to Nashville). Michael Dell, the founder of Dell Technologies, has long lived in Texas.\n\nSacks made his announcement on 31 December, posting an image of the Texas flag on X and saying: “God bless Texas.” In a separate post the following day, Sacks wrote: “As a response to socialism, Miami will replace NYC as the finance capital and Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.”\n\nMusk, Lonsdale and Dell all responded with hearty welcomes. “No one will fight harder for the independent and free spirit of Texas than people who know [sic] it’s like when that’s taken away,” Musk wrote.\n\nPage has not publicly said where he’s moving, but in December companies associated with the Google co-founder filed documents to incorporate in Florida, according to the New York Times. Thiel, who owns a home in the Hollywood Hills, also seems to have set his sights on Florida. His investment firm, Thiel Capital, announced on 31 December that it had opened an office in Miami. The firm said Thiel has maintained a personal residence in the city since 2020.\n\nOn X, tech investors and other billionaires have blasted the proposed wealth tax. Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist and former Facebook executive, said that without billionaires, California’s “budget deficit will only get bigger”, and Vinod Khosla, another investor, said that under the proposed tax, “California will lose its most important taxpayers and net off much worse”.\n\nSome have indicated they’d work to oust Khanna from Congress. Martin Casado, a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, wrote that Khanna had “devolved into an obnoxious jerk” and that his support of the wealth tax had alienated him from moderates. In response, Garry Tan, the CEO of the startup accelerator Y Combinator, wrote: “Time to primary him.”\n\nThe SEIU’s Jimenez said states like Massachusetts and Washington, which have other forms of wealth taxes, have seen billions of dollars raised to help the state. At the same time, she said, high-income residents have continued to see their portfolios grow. Jimenez added that the union is “heartened” by Huang’s recent comments and is hopeful that more billionaires will follow suit.\n\nAs for Huang, he said Nvidia is in Silicon Valley because that’s where the engineers are and he’s not worried about a billionaire tax.\n\n“Not this person,” Huang said. “This person is trying to build the future of AI.”\n\nRepresentatives for Page, Thiel, Sacks and Newsom did not return requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "Mark Cuban has an idea for how to stop the runaway train that is the $38 trillion national debt, and it has a lot to do with the online pharmacy company he founded in January 2022. On Christmas Eve, the billionaire investor posted on X about his frustrations with the insurance market.\n\nInsurers and providers, according to Cuban, “play on the fear and information asymmetry that exists in healthcare.” He advocated for them to be broken up, so as to “make the markets efficient again.”\n\nWhile Cuban’s proposal focused on $100 fines for insurers that over-bill or deny care, the broader thrust of his argument is dismantling opaque middlemen and forcing transparent pricing—as he does with his Cost Plus Drugs pharmacy—could help tame one of the biggest drivers of America’s fiscal strain.​\n\nAmerica’s national debt surged past $38 trillion in October, adding roughly $1 trillion in just over two months in 2025—twice the pace of typical growth since 2000, according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a leading fiscal watchdog. Annual interest payments are already around $1 trillion and could total as much as $14 trillion over the coming decade, a trajectory the watchdog warns is “no way for a great nation like America to run its finances.” A closer look at health insurance and over-billing doesn’t exactly find fixing the issue would fix the debt or deficit​, but Cuban is right that something is definitely off in this space.\n\nCost Plus Drugs sells medications at their manufacturing cost, plus a flat 15% markup, a small pharmacy fee, and a posted shipping charge. The company cuts out traditional pharmacy benefit managers and negotiates directly with manufacturers, publishing acquisition costs and formulas so customers can see exactly how their prices are built.​\n\nFortune and other outlets have reported Cost Plus Drugs can slash the price of some generics from thousands of dollars a month to double‑digit sums, especially for patients who are uninsured or stuck with high deductibles. Cuban argues if similar transparency and direct‑to‑consumer models were applied across health care—combined with rules like letting cash prices count toward insurance deductibles—the country could strip out layers of waste that burden both families and, ultimately, public budgets.",

    "title": "Doctors And Nurses Are Confessing \"Dark Secrets\" About The Medical Field That No One Knows",
    "description": "\"So many of our patients and families are entitled and treat medical staff horribly. They literally harass us. Hospitals are not hotels, and doctors' offices are not spas. Have some compassion.\"",
    "fullText": "\"God forbid you take your lunch or get a drink of water. The facilities were skilled facilities with minimal staff. Gave up my license when I retired because I never want to do that stuff again. When money is more important than a human, we have lost sight of the purpose of nursing and medical care.\"\n\n\"I can go on and on, but you get the picture. At this point, I am trying my best to retire early.\"\n\n\"Yes, you will wait longer, and I think that's why patients don't take this route (because it's slower).\"\n\n\"Please just be kind to the medical staff. They truly are doing their best.\"\n\n\"I had a deep respect for ALL medical personnel and still do! I loved my job and the people I worked with! This warning is not written by a disgruntled employee.\"\n\n\"Come to find out, the insurance company was not properly reviewing charts because oftentimes, prescriptions weren't filled because the medication had been changed. Or the cost of the med or co-pay was too high. So, we were berated for things outside our control or because they couldn’t be bothered to look at the full picture. The insurance company then offered incentives (aka, bribes) to persuade the patients to fill these discontinued prescriptions or tests they didn’t want. My colleague, who owned the clinic, asked them how far they wanted us to go. Did they want us to pay for their prescriptions? Drive to their homes and shove the pills down their throats? Remove them from their homes and drive them kicking and screaming to the lab, radiology place, or surgicenter? I have never been prouder to work with him. Of course, the insurance company didn’t like that at all and said we were being unreasonable.When I left for the day, I called my husband to discuss borrowing money from my parents to pay for my tail coverage (around $22K), which is essentially a buyout of your malpractice coverage that continues to insure you for a specified amount of time once you stop practicing. I was so worried he’d think less of me for wanting to quit medicine. I’d spent so many years where I’d worked so hard under awful conditions to get where I was. Was it a waste? Nope. He was so supportive. Just wanted me to be happy. Wanted me to be able to sleep at night without sleeping pills. For my terrible work-related anxiety to get better. My family was the same way. My stepdad didn’t even let me finish my story before he asked how much money I’d need to quit. I’m so lucky to have that kind of help. After a few months, I got a university teaching job, quit medicine, and have never looked back. I miss some patients, but nothing else.\"\n\n\"On top of that, they would insult us and call us racist names. I reported them to my school, and I was the one who paid. I wasn't accepted into any residency, and as a result, I was unable to practice medicine. I now work at a tech company and make twice what I would have made as a family doctor, working decent hours from the comfort of my own home.\"\n\n\"Also, we are not trying to 'run up your bill' with treatments and medications. We have no idea what the hospital will charge you. We don't even know what kind of insurance you have or if you have insurance at all, unless they call us to deny something.\n\nThe new rules that came out a few years ago mean patients can see their test results before the doctor does. The point is good — it's intended for patients to access their records. But imagine logging into your healthcare portal to find out that your MRI detected cancer that you didn't even know about, and your doctor hasn't had a chance to come in and talk to you about it yet. Many people don't understand the wording in their test results, and they don't know what a lot of the lab values mean. So, it makes them very anxious, or they go straight to Google and read about worst-case scenarios. In the past, doctors would review the results first and then release them for patient review.\n\nLastly, Google is a great resource, but that's just it. It's a resource. It doesn't replace the education and experience of your medical staff. People will literally argue with us because they googled things and insist that we are wrong. We spend all day trying to help people. It doesn't benefit us to give you false information. Consider trusting the people who work in healthcare for a living.\"\n\n\"Insurance companies are a different market profiting beast that has more healthcare power decision-making than they should be allowed to have. I've seen so many patients, as well as family members, get denied for life-saving medications prescribed by a doctor with adequate evidence for proof of medical necessity. I've seen too many preventable deaths and injuries as a result of callous decision-making from insurance companies.\"\n\nNote: Some submissions have been edited for length and/or clarity.\n\nAlso in Work & Money: 17 Screenshots Of Selfish Coworkers Who Took \"Unprofessional\" To A Whole New Level\n\nAlso in Work & Money: 19 People Reveal The Red Flags That Made Them Say \"I'm Outta Here\" During A Job Interview, And The Toxicity Is Palpable\n\nAlso in Work & Money: 23 \"Poverty Habits\" That Are Honestly So, So, So Real — Especially In This Trash-Fire Economy",

    "fullText": "Age 65 is a major transition for many individuals as they shift to thinking about retirement and begin to contemplate benefits like Social Security and Medicare. Retirement planning means you’ll have to consider taxes, healthcare, your retirement budget and more. With $1.5 million in an IRA and two Social Security payments to rely on, a married couple should have some flexibility for retirement, but their individual circumstances and how they strategize can make a big difference in their quality of life. Here’s how to think about it.\n\nIf you need help planning and saving for retirement, consider working with a financial advisor.\n\nIf you’re approaching retirement, the first area to examine is your expected savings, income and planned retirement date. Basically, how much money will you have and when? Your income, both from your portfolio and your benefits, will depend heavily on when you choose to retire.\n\nFor example, let’s say you’re currently 65, have started collecting Social Security and your IRA is invested in a mixed-asset portfolio with an 8% annual rate of return. If you retire at 67 (full retirement age) and don’t plan to continue contributing to your account, here’s what your finances could look like at retirement:\n\nBenefits: $4,200/month ($50,400/year)\n\nOn the other hand, say that you wait until age 70 to retire and claim your Social Security. Again, take an 8% average return on a mixed-asset portfolio and discount additional contributions. By retirement you might have:\n\nBenefits: $5,208/month ($62,496/year)\n\nFor the purposes of this article, we’ll assume that you retire at 67. The point here is that delaying retirement can help you increase your retirement budget in many cases. And if you need help determining a suitable time to retire, connect with a financial advisor and talk it over.\n\nSmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nOnce you know how much income you can expect to generate each year, the next step is to make a budget for it.\n\n“When determining a retirement budget, the goal isn’t just to ensure your money lasts, but to ensure it lasts in a way that maintains your quality of life,” said Aaron Cirksena, CEO and Founder of MDRN Capital. “With $1.5 million in an IRA and a steady stream of Social Security benefits, it’s about balancing the financial priorities with personal priorities. You calculate based on expected needs and foreseeable expenses, but also on the less tangible aspects — like aspirations, goals, dreams and the peace of mind.”",

    "description": "Can you live well on $100,000 per year in retirement? ChatGPT mapped out the complete budget including travel, healthcare and housing. Here's the reality.",
    "fullText": "Most retirement budgets assume you’re pinching pennies. But what if you saved well and want to actually enjoy retirement? I asked ChatGPT to map out a $100,000-per-year retirement budget for someone who wants comfort without being wasteful. The artificial intelligence’s breakdown was thorough and felt fairly realistic.\n\nThe chatbot designed a monthly spending plan, calculated how much you’d need saved and identified the best places to live on this income level. According to ChatGPT, here’s what a six-figure retirement actually looks like.\n\nChatGPT started by clarifying that $100,000 annually puts you well above average retirees. This budget supports quality healthcare, regular travel, a nice home in a desirable area and room for unexpected expenses. You’re not living extravagantly, but you’re comfortable.\n\nThe AI wrote that this lifestyle requires either strong savings or a combination of savings plus Social Security and possibly a pension.\n\nFind Out: How Much the Average Upper-Class Retiree Spends Monthly at Age 69\n\nRead Next: 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up To $1K per Month From Home\n\nOne hundred thousand dollars per year equals about $8,333 monthly. ChatGPT broke this down into realistic categories.\n\nHousing costs $2,500 to $3,500 per month. This covers either a nice rental in a high-demand city or a mortgage-free home where you only pay property taxes, insurance and HOA fees. The chatbot gave specific examples: Austin, Texas, runs about $3,200 monthly; Phoenix around $2,600; and Tampa, Florida around $2,400. San Diego pushes toward $3,500 or more.\n\nFood and dining take $1,200 to $1,800 monthly. ChatGPT explained this includes high-quality groceries from stores like Whole Foods or Trader Joe’s plus eating out two to four times weekly. The budget also covers occasional hosting and holiday meals.\n\nTransportation costs $600 to $900 per month. The AI assumed you might have a car payment along with insurance, gas and maintenance. If you live in a walkable city without a car, this drops to $200 to $300 monthly.\n\nHealthcare and insurance run $800 to $1,500 depending on your age and state. ChatGPT broke this down as Medicare Parts B and D, supplemental Medigap or Advantage plans, dental and vision coverage, prescription medications and any specialist visits. The AI warned that people under 65 should budget toward the higher end.\n\nUtilities cost $300 to $500 monthly for electricity, water, gas, trash, internet and streaming subscriptions.\n\nTravel gets a significant chunk at $10,000 to $15,000 annually, which equals $850 to $1,250 monthly. ChatGPT explained this covers one to two major international trips plus domestic getaways, hotels and dining abroad. The AI wrote that travel makes a huge difference in retirement satisfaction.",

    "fullText": "(NEXSTAR) – Hospitals, nursing homes and other medical facilities are struggling to gain ground on a drug-resistant and deadly fungus that has infected at least 7,000 people in 2025, according to tracking by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nCandida auris, a fungus that was first reported in the U.S. in 2016, has spread rapidly over the past several years. It can survive on surfaces for long periods of time before spreading to patients through catheters, breathing tubes or IVs.\n\nSome strains of the fungus are considered a superbug because they’re resistant to all types of antibiotics usually used to treat fungal infections. While healthy people may be able to fight off the infection on their own, the fungus can be deadly in the health care settings where it spreads, where people are often sick and vulnerable.\n\nFungus labeled ‘urgent threat’ by CDC is spreading rapidly, hospital study finds\n\n“If you get infected with this pathogen that’s resistant to any treatment, there’s no treatment we can give you to help combat it. You’re all on your own,” Melissa Nolan, an assistant professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of South Carolina, told Nexstar.\n\nThe fungus’ drug resistance has made it especially hard to contain. More than half of states reported clinical cases of Candida auris in 2025, the CDC reported. With one week of data left in the year, the annual case count is approaching last year’s record-breaking figure of more than 7,500 cases.\n\nSee which states are reporting the most cases of Candida auris in the map below. Data was missing for two states: Alabama and Florida.\n\nSome scientists theorize climate change is contributing to the spread of Candida auris and pathogens like it.\n\nHistorically, fungi have had a hard time surviving at our bodies’ warm body temperature, microbiologist Arturo Casadevall, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, told the Associated Press. But as the climate warms, the fungi are adapting.\n\n“We have tremendous protection against environmental fungi because of our temperature. However, if the world is getting warmer and the fungi begin to adapt to higher temperatures as well, some … are going to reach what I call the temperature barrier,” where they’ll be able to survive in the human body, Casadevall said.\n\nCandida auris: Study reveals who is most vulnerable to deadly fungus infection\n\nIn the past, the CDC estimated that “based on information from a limited number of patients, 30–60% of people with C. auris infections have died. However, many of these people had other serious illnesses that also increased their risk of death.”\n\nA study published in July, which looked at patients with Candida auris primarily in Nevada and Florida, found more than half of patients required admission to the intensive care unit and more than one-third needed mechanical ventilation. More than half of patients, whose average age was between 60 and 64, also needed a blood transfusion.",

Officials said the average award for 2026 is $200 million, and the fund puts a total of $50 billion into rural health programs over five years.  States propose how to spend their awards, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services assigns project officers to support each state, said agency administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz.",
    "fullText": "States will share $10 billion for rural health care next year in a program that aims to offset the Trump administration's massive budget cuts to rural hospitals, federal officials announced Monday.\n\nBut while every state applied for money from the Rural Health Transformation Program, it won't be distributed equally. And critics worry that the funding might be pulled back if a state's policies don't match up with the administration's.\n\nOfficials said the average award for 2026 is $200 million, and the fund puts a total of $50 billion into rural health programs over five years. States propose how to spend their awards, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services assigns project officers to support each state, said agency administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz.\n\n“This fund was crafted as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill, signed only six months ago now into law, in order to push states to be creative,\" Oz said in a call with reporters Monday.\n\nUnder the program, half of the money is equally distributed to each state. The other half is allocated based on a formula developed by CMS that considered rural population size, the financial health of a state’s medical facilities and health outcomes for a state’s population.\n\nThe formula also ties $12 billion of the five-year funding to whether states are implementing health policies prioritized by the Trump administration's “Make America Healthy Again” initiative. Examples include requiring nutrition education for health care providers, having schools participate in the Presidential Fitness Test or banning the use of SNAP benefits for so-called junk foods, Oz said.\n\nSeveral Republican-led states — including Arkansas, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas — have already adopted rules banning the purchase of foods like candy and soda with SNAP benefits.\n\nThe money that the states get will be recalculated annually, Oz said, allowing the administration to “claw back” funds if, for example, state leaders don't pass promised policies. Oz said the clawbacks are not punishments, but leverage governors can use to push policies by pointing to the potential loss of millions.\n\n“I've already heard governors express that sentiment that this is not a threat, that this is actually an empowering element of the One Big Beautiful Bill,\" he said.\n\nCarrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer with the National Rural Health Association, said she’s heard from a number of Democratic-led states that refused to include such restrictions on SNAP benefits even though it could hurt their chance to get more money from the fund.\n\n“It’s not where their state leadership is,” she said.\n\nExperts say fund is inadequate in face of other cuts\n\nOz and other federal officials have touted the program as a 50% increase in Medicaid investments in rural health care. Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican from Nebraska who has been critical of many of the administration’s policies but voted for the budget bill that slashed Medicaid, pointed to the fund when recently questioned about how the cuts would hurt rural hospitals.\n\n“That’s why we added a $50 billion rural hospital fund, to help any hospital that’s struggling,” Bacon said. “This money is meant to keep hospitals afloat.”\n\nBut experts say it won't nearly offset the losses that struggling rural hospitals will face from the federal spending law's $1.2 trillion cut from the federal budget over the next decade, primarily from Medicaid. Millions of people are also expected to lose Medicaid benefits.\n\nEstimates suggest rural hospitals could lose around $137 billion over the next decade because of the budget measure. As many as 300 rural hospitals were at risk for closure because of the GOP’s spending package, according to an analysis by The Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\n“When you put that up against the $50 billion for the Rural Health Transformation Fund, you know — that math does not add up,” Cochran-McClain said.\n\nShe also said there's no guarantee that the funding will go to rural hospitals in need. For example, she noted, one state’s application included a proposal for healthier, locally sourced school lunch options in rural areas.\n\nAnd even though innovation is a goal of the program, Cochran-McClain said it's tough for rural hospitals to innovate when they were struggling to break even before Congress’ Medicaid cuts.\n\n“We talk to rural providers every day that say, ‘I would really love to do x, y, z, but I’m concerned about, you know, meeting payroll at the end of the month,’” she said. “So when you’re in that kind of crisis mode, it is, I would argue, almost impossible to do true innovation.”\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "Diane Brady writes about the issues and leaders impacting the global business landscape. In addition to writing Fortune’s CEO Daily newsletter, she co-hosts the Leadership Next podcast, interviews newsmakers on stage at events worldwide and oversees the Fortune CEO Initiative. She previously worked at Forbes, McKinsey, Bloomberg Businessweek, the Wall Street Journal, and Maclean's. Her book Fraternity was named one of Amazon’s best books of 2012, and she also co-wrote Connecting the Dots with former Cisco CEO John Chambers.\n\nOn Jan. 4, 2023, GE HealthCare Technologies (No. 219 on the Fortune 500) debuted as a standalone public company on the Nasdaq exchange. Since then, its stock is up almost 50%. It was the first of three businesses to be spun off in the breakup of General Electric, the conglomerate founded on the inventions of Thomas Edison that went public in 1892 and became one of the original 12 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average four years later. (GE Vernova, No. 130, and GE Aerospace, No. 118, each went public on the New York Stock Exchange in April 2024.)\n\nGE HealthCare CEO Peter J. Arduini, the man tapped to lead the $20 billion-a-year business, spoke to Fortune about how he’s forging a new chapter for the medical technology and digital health company while drawing on GE’s legacy.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nYou were initially at GE during the Jack Welch years, starting in 1990, and left a few years after Jeff Immelt took over. What do you think made GE stand apart?\n\nAt the time, I was a Proctor & Gamble guy, and I did not love the grocery business. I got a call from someone who talked about a perfect opportunity in technology and global businesses at a company called GE Medical Systems at the time. I didn’t even know GE had a medical business then.\n\nGoing to GE in those days, with its leadership development, you had the opportunity to take on bigger responsibilities at a very young age—I look back and say, probably too young an age. But it was one of those rare companies where they gave you bold assignments and you had this wide diversity of potential opportunities that you could play in. You learned how to run a company the GE way. The candor and the openness about what’s working, what’s not working, really permeated, how to do the right thing. It was tough culture, but you knew it was a fair culture, and that’s what really made it successful under Jack.\n\nAfter leaving in 2005, what made you decide to come back?\n\nA headhunter called and said, [the then-GE CEO] Larry Culp wants to speak with you.’ And I said, ‘I don’t know if I’m really interested in going back to GE.’ My wife convinced me to give a call back. I talked to the headhunter, and he said, ‘Well, I’ll pass it on to Larry.’ Literally, 10 minutes later, I got a text that said, ‘Hey, Pete, this is Larry Culp. I’d love to chat with you.’ I texted back to say, ‘Well, look, I can contact your assistant.’ And Larry, right then, said, ‘Hey, do you have five minutes now?’ That’s the essence of Larry; he’s a very down-to-earth guy, a very focused and very intentional guy.\n\nThose five minutes convinced you to take the job?\n\nIt was probably more than the five, but honestly, his impact and his leadership made a difference. This was a chance to create three separate companies, to take this company public. I got very interested and very excited about it.\n\nWhy did it make sense for GE HealthCare to be a separate company?\n\nEverything has a cycle. On the technology side and on the market side, there was such a fast transition and evolution, with new competitors coming into new markets. When you’re in a larger business, in many cases, decisions take longer. And focus matters in our business. It is all about signal to noise; you want more signal, less noise. In a larger company, there has to be a little bit more noise.\n\nThe past three years have been interesting time for med tech. Looking back, what did you over-index on or under-appreciate?\n\nAt a macro level, look at the environment, between the China market, which was always a double-digit growth or changing the geopolitical environment and how we need to change around our supply chains because of tariffs. Those are kind of the unplanned events that where you ask: Do you have the right people? Do you have a management system that can deal with the clock speed and the differentiation? Do you have the right innovation-processing capability? If you don’t have the innovation, it’s difficult to get the price, it’s difficult to hold share, it’s difficult to grow. We were somewhat of a cash cow as part of the GE integrated model. We weren’t starved, but we weren’t funded for leading innovation. So I’d say one of the things I felt that I did well—and, like most credit, comes from listening to people that are wiser than you and having humility to understand that that’s the action—is lean into innovation.\n\nYou think what products you need, four years out, and fund them to the max, because it’s the rules of the farm. You got to get the seeds in the ground. They’ve got to germinate. You got to get the plants to grow till you get fruit. In our business, that’s a three to five year cycle.\n\n“We laid out this purpose of creating a world where health care has no limits, and a big part of that was to say we’re humble to know that we don’t have all the answers.”GE HealthCare CEO Peter J. Arduini\n\nI think our teams did a really good job with the focus on making the right investments early. In 2018, to give an example, we probably spent $750 million to $800 million on research and development. R&D will be north of $1.4 billion this year. So we fundamentally doubled the R&D investment. We cut costs in other areas and simplified some of the company.\n\nThrough lean manufacturing techniques?\n\nWe changed some of the field organization, about 40% to 50% of the leaders. We upgraded talent across the board, and I spent a lot of time on what our vision is, what our values are, and do we have the right people who can match up to that? In the last two years, we’ve really made a lot of progress on what we’re calling our heartbeat management system, which is really about a lean principles construct for how you run your company. What is the daily management at different levels in the organization? What is standard work that is needed to be done in all areas, the use of Kaizen and really bringing customer employees into the decision making?\n\nLarry Culp is a big proponent of Kaizen and I think back to GE’s reputation in promoting Six Sigma. How would you say the culture has shifted as an independent company?\n\nI tried to take the GE of old and took what was really good: how we think about our distribution of leadership, how we actually talk about leader development, how we build out our own Crotonville virtual university of development. The GE model was really stellar, and, honestly, prior to Larry coming back, some of that had dissolved. We didn’t even really do performance reviews in the same way and he brought that back.\n\nI would say I even reached back further to some of the Jack Welch-period of tools, There are things that we did really well that we want to utilize in a more contemporary way. As an example, I think Crotonville was a fabulous destination for training and development, In today’s world, it’s not practical to bring everybody to upstate New York, but we can take the tools and the capabilities and recreate that in virtual and other environments around the world.\n\nIn health care, we had our own distinct way of thinking about innovation pipeline, and it was something called worldwide product. It had kind of phased away in the last decade or so, and I resurrected it, but in a new format: more digital focused, more connected …from diagnosis through therapy, through action, follow up and how the money flows. The integration of cloud-based computing and artificial intelligence. We look at the full stack for the company. And that’s been a game changer for us to take valuable resources and move them.\n\nWe laid out this purpose of creating a world where health care has no limits, and a big part of that was to say we’re humble to know that we don’t have all the answers. We want to work with customers on jointly solving problems which, again, is the core to the lean mindset. Servant leadership as a big part of it, which turns the pyramid upside down. My job is to help everybody else get their job done. We’re all focused on the customer. We’re all focused on the patient. We spent a lot of time talking about entrepreneurship because in our business, the way we’re going to be successful is in this broader ecosystem. We don’t have to own everything, we don’t have to make everything, but we have to be more creative. We talk about teamwork and inclusive teams. We actually drive and reward and recognize people on how well they live up to those values.\n\nThe landscape has shifted for global companies. Where do you see the biggest challenges and opportunities right now?\n\nIf I think about med tech as an industry, it’s an American gem. Still, 70%-plus of the products are made the United States, the majority of the IP, the technology is here. And so having that protected or enhanced by our government policy is important.\n\nWe’ve spent a lot of time trying to make that case clear and I think, for the most part, it’s been heard. Having global footprints and manufacturing and R&D is super critical because you can’t make everything in the United States to be competitive. You can’t, in a world post-COVID, have an integrated single point of control for all supply chains. Many of us used to say, here’s the least expensive place to buy this, or the best quality, then we would do it one place and ship it all over the world. We found during COVID that’s just not the model that works.\n\nWe’re bringing more and more U.S. products and their subcomponents back to North America. In China, we used to ship in 75% of the products from different parts around the world. Now we make 85%, almost 90% of the products in China, for China.\n\nWhy do you want to be in China?\n\nLook,it’s 1.4 billion people, where 400 million have reasonable. We often forget that. You know, we’re a nation of 375 million people, and you can judge how good our care is. There’s still a billion people in China that don’t have adequate care, and so at some point, it will be the largest health care market. I’m a big believer that, with China and the U.S., the more we work together in harmony, it’s only going to help the world. And honestly, for companies like us, it’s really a necessity for being able to kind of reach our full potential.\n\nYou’ve been at companies that are known as training grounds for leaders. I’d just love to hear your reflections on being in a CEO role the last three years.\n\nI think authenticity is super important. I can be an extrovert when needed, but I tend to be a little bit more introverted. In today’s world, with our younger employee base, being out front and being vocal as the senior leader—not necessarily the charismatic leader, but the communicator directly to individuals—is super important. Social media gets more reads from your employees than even some internal communications. It’s a reality.\n\nI think this ability to reach people in many different ways is critical for running a company. Leaning in on what the mission of the company is, and the why and helping people understand the why, is also critical. And then there’s the classic age-old factor of bringing customers into the story, talking about how you’ve changed the life of a patient. This could be your mother, your father on that table. The more I can empower people to live those values, that’s how we get excellence.",

    "title": "Study Shows Alzheimer's Disease Can Be Reversed in Animal Models",
    "description": "Researchers from University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland VA showed restoring the brain’s energy balance led to both pathological and functional recovery.",
    "fullText": "Dr. Andrew Pieper, senior author of the study.\n\nCLEVELAND – For over a century, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been considered irreversible. Consequently, research has focused on disease prevention or slowing, rather than recovery. Despite billions of dollars spent on decades of research, there has never been a clinical trial of a drug for AD with an outcome goal of reversing disease and recovering function.\n\nNow, a research team from University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University, and the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center has challenged this long-held dogma in the field. They tested whether brains already badly afflicted with advanced AD could recover.\n\nThe study, led by Kalyani Chaubey, PhD, from the Pieper Laboratory, published today in Cell Reports Medicine. Through studying diverse preclinical mouse models and human AD brains, the team showed that the brain’s failure to maintain normal levels of a central cellular energy molecule, NAD+, is a major driver of AD, and that maintaining proper NAD+ balance can prevent and even reverse the disease.\n\nNAD+ levels decline naturally across the body, including the brain, as people age. Without proper NAD+ balance, cells eventually become unable to execute critical processes required for proper functioning and survival. In this study, the team showed that the decline in NAD+ is even more severe in the brains of people with AD, and that this also occurs in mouse models of the disease.\n\nWhile AD is a uniquely human condition, it can be studied in the laboratory with mice that have been engineered to express genetic mutations that cause AD in people. The researchers used two of these models. One line of mice carried multiple human mutations in amyloid processing, and the other mouse line carried a human mutation in the tau protein. Amyloid and tau pathology are two of the major early events in AD, and both lines of mice develop brain pathology resembling AD, including blood-brain barrier deterioration, axonal degeneration, neuroinflammation, impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, reduced synaptic transmission, and widespread accumulation of oxidative damage. These mice also develop severe cognitive impairments that resemble what is seen in people with AD.\n\nAfter finding that NAD+ levels in the brain declined precipitously in both human and mouse AD, the research team tested whether preventing the loss of brain NAD+ balance before disease onset, or restoring brain NAD+ balance after significant disease progression, could prevent or reverse AD, respectively. The study was based on their previous work, published in Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences USA, showing that restoring the brain's NAD+ balance achieved pathological and functional recovery after severe, long-lasting traumatic brain injury. They restored NAD+ balance by administering a now well-characterized pharmacologic agent known as P7C3-A20, developed in the Pieper lab.\n\nRemarkably, not only did preserving NAD+ balance protect mice from developing AD, but delayed treatment in mice with advanced disease also enabled the brain to fix the major pathological events caused by the genetic mutations. Moreover, both lines of mice fully recovered cognitive function. This was accompanied by normalized blood levels of phosphorylated tau 217, a recently approved clinical biomarker of AD in people, providing confirmation of disease reversal and highlighting a potential biomarker for future clinical trials.\n\n“We were very excited and encouraged by our results,” said Andrew A. Pieper, MD, PhD, senior author of the study and Director of the Brain Health Medicines Center, Harrington Discovery Institute at UH. “Restoring the brain's energy balance achieved pathological and functional recovery in both lines of mice with advanced Alzheimer's. Seeing this effect in two very different animal models, each driven by different genetic causes, strengthens the idea that restoring the brain’s NAD+ balance might help patients recover from Alzheimer’s.”\n\nDr. Pieper also holds the Morley-Mather Chair in Neuropsychiatry at UH and the CWRU Rebecca E. Barchas, MD, DLFAPA, University Professorship in Translational Psychiatry. He serves as Psychiatrist and Investigator in the Louis Stokes VA Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center (GRECC).\n\nThe results prompt a paradigm shift in how researchers, clinicians, and patients can think about treating AD in the future. “The key takeaway is a message of hope – the effects of Alzheimer's disease may not be inevitably permanent,” said Dr. Pieper. “The damaged brain can, under some conditions, repair itself and regain function.”\n\nDr. Chaubey further explained, “Through our study, we demonstrated one drug-based way to accomplish this in animal models, and also identified candidate proteins in the human AD brain that may relate to the ability to reverse AD.”\n\nDr. Pieper emphasized that currently available over the counter NAD+-precursors have been shown in animal models to raise cellular NAD+ to dangerously high levels that promote cancer The approach in this study, however, uses a pharmacologic agent (P7C3-A20) that enables cells to maintain their proper balance of NAD+ under conditions of otherwise overwhelming stress, without elevating NAD+ to supraphysiologic levels.\n\n“This is important when considering patient care, and clinicians should consider the possibility that therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring brain energy balance might offer a path to disease recovery,” said Dr. Pieper.\n\nThis work also encourages new research into complementary approaches and eventual testing in patients, and the technology is being commercialized by Cleveland-based company Glengary Brain Health, co-founded by Dr. Pieper.\n\n“This new therapeutic approach to recovery needs to be moved into carefully designed human clinical trials to determine whether the efficacy seen in animal models translates to human patients,” Dr. Pieper explained. “Additional next steps for the laboratory research include pinpointing which aspects of brain energy balance are most important for recovery, identifying and evaluating complementary approaches to Alzheimer's reversal, and investigating whether this recovery approach is also effective in other forms of chronic, age-related neurodegenerative disease.”\n\nChaubey, Kalyani et al. “Pharmacologic reversal of Alzheimer’s disease in mice reveals potential therapeutic nodes in human brain.” Cell Reports Medicine. DOI: 10.1016/j.xcrm.2025.102535\n\nTags:\r\n Alzheimer's Disease, Aging",

    "fullText": "After seven wonderful years in Budapest, I had to move back to the US in early 2025 because of visa issues.\n\nPacking up my life and saying goodbye to my community, network, and home was an emotional whirlwind — to say the least.\n\nLooking back, there are things I'm grateful I did, and others I would have done differently to make the transition easier. Here they are.\n\nWhen it came time to pack, I slowly deconstructed my apartment over the course of a month.\n\nI made endless trips to the thrift store, posted on Facebook Marketplace, and even hosted a move-out party where I made snacks for my friends while they raided my closet.\n\nAfter all that, I still found myself frantically sitting on my suitcase, trying to zip it right up until my ride to the airport arrived.\n\nHowever, I can't imagine how stressed I would have been if I had left packing to the last minute.\n\nFrom Hungarian tax forms to old leases, I'm glad I had the foresight to keep all my paperwork from my time abroad.\n\nSince much of my work was international, I didn't have as extensive a paper trail here in the States. I feel relieved that I have all my documents, so I don't appear to have been a \"ghost\" for all that time.\n\nPlus, keeping them helped me sort out my finances when I got home. I spent a lot of my early years in Budapest operating off of feelings instead of building financial literacy skills, and that didn't put me in the best spot.\n\nReflecting on old tax and income documents helped me come to terms with the rocky finances of my early 20s and motivated me to make a better game plan for my next phase of life.\n\nLosing the connections, friends, and home I'd built over seven years was shocking.\n\nAt first, I tried to stay positive by looking for silver linings, such as being home for family birthdays and surrounded by the gorgeous Pacific Northwest nature. However, I eventually had to slow down and let myself feel the heartbreak.\n\nI took a social media break from friends and events in Budapest, so I could be mentally present in my new situation.\n\nTalking about this transition on social media also helped me build a community with other former expats going through the same thing.\n\nUnfortunately, before returning, I underestimated the state of the US job market. Although I found a part-time job as a barista to supplement my freelance marketing gigs, I still haven't found longer-term work that's both a financial and vocational fit.\n\nI've come to realize that relationships are what make the world go round, both professionally and personally, and after seven years abroad, I had to rebuild my Stateside network nearly from scratch.\n\nI wish I'd started putting out feelers as soon as I'd known I was returning to the US, and I wish I had signed up for relevant conferences to jump-start that goal.\n\nI was so consumed with the tasks of cleaning out my flat, closing my accounts, and saying goodbye to friends that health was the last thing on my mind.\n\nHowever, I wish I'd capitalized on booking doctors' appointments when they were more affordable abroad, as it's taken a long time to get set up with healthcare now that I'm back in the US.\n\nMaybe in a perfect world, I would have returned to the US with a job lined up, an affordable one-bedroom apartment in the city, and a group of old friends with open schedules. But that wasn't the case for me.\n\nSeeing other expats' stories about returning home on social media made it look like these things fall into place quickly, and I struggled with feelings of shame and inadequacy for not achieving that right away.\n\nBut looking back over this year, I've made quiet, steady progress that has set me up for a stronger future.\n\nI've supported my physical and mental health through training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and I've built a travel writing portfolio by landing a press trip and writing other articles.\n\nStep by step, I'm reaching my goals, and I'm proud.",

That frustration is what Mark Cuban, the self-made billionaire and longtime Shark Tank investor, decided to unpack on his own — without being asked.\n\nIn January, Cuban returned to his personal site, Blog Maverick, after a long stretch of silence. \"I haven't published anything on here in a long, long time.. Thought it would be fun to start up again,\" he wrote. He said the post was meant to be informal and exploratory. \"I wanted to give some stream of consciousness thoughts on how I think we can ‘fix' the economics of healthcare.. Hopefully I make a lot of folks think and make a lot of folks in the industry think harder.\"\n\nEarn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\n\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nFrom there, Cuban went straight to what he sees as the core problem. \"Healthcare is a very simple industry made complicated,\" he wrote, arguing that the complexity isn't driven by better care but by the pursuit of margin dollars.\n\nWhen Cuban asked what healthcare should look like, his answer was intentionally retro. \"Hypothetically, it should look like 1955,\" he wrote. \"Patients go to providers for care. Providers provide that care. Patients get a bill and if they can afford it, they pay that bill. That's it.\"\n\nIn his view, everything else is secondary. \"The ONLY question in healthcare should be ‘How should care for people who can't afford to pay for their care be paid?'\" he wrote. The rest, he suggested, is noise layered onto a transaction that used to be straightforward.\n\nTrending: GM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\n\nCuban also took aim at how pricing gets obscured. He criticized bundled charges, markups on basic supplies, and contracts so complex they hide real costs. Publishing prices alone doesn't solve it, he argued, when \"everyone bundles and upcodes and plays games.\"\n\nInsurance companies, he wrote, are a major source of that distortion. Managing and administering payments alone can add 20% to 30% in overhead, before accounting for fraud and overbilling. \"That's real money,\" Cuban said, especially in a system he estimates costs about $5 trillion a year.",

Unfortunately, Bryant and his daughter Gianna died in the helicopter crash. Celebrities, friends, and basketball fans around the world mourned their unfortunate death.\n\nInterestingly, following Bryant and his daughter’s demise, various media outlets reported a surge in the names “Kobe” and “Gianna” as popular baby names. BabyCenter released its list of the most popular baby names of 2020. According to the list, the name Kobe increased in popularity by 175 percent and Gianna by a whopping 216 percent.\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. Social Security Administration reported that American parents favored Kobe and Gianna as names for their newborns. In 2020, 1,500 families named their newborn Kobe, representing 0.082 percent of the total male births. Also, 55 girls were named Kobe, including basketball player Kevin Pillar (via PEOPLE and Newsweek).\n\nHowever, there is no concrete evidence that LA hospitals have banned the name Kobe starting in 2026.

    "description": "Citi said it was overweight on info tech, healthcare, and financial stocks heading into the first quarter of 2026.",
    "fullText": "The investing playbook to follow in the new year homes in on three key sectors of the stock market, according to Citigroup.\n\nThe bank's investment research arm unveiled its list of sector calls heading into the first quarter of 2026, which included three areas it believes investors should be overweight in as the new year begins: Information technology, financials, and healthcare.\n\nBesides financials, those sectors have seen a stellar performance in 2025. The healthcare sector of the S&P 500 is up 17% for the year, while technology stocks are up 28% year-to-date, beating the benchmark index. The financials sector has lagged the broader market, up 6% since January.\n\n\"For most of '25, we led with a Growth cluster focus while frequently advocating a Cyclical barbell,\" the bank wrote of its portfolio based on its 2025 sector picks, which outperformed the S&P 500 by over four percentage points. \"Headed into '26, we focus on a better balance with Defensives. This is aligned with our expectations for fundamental broadening,\" it said of its outlook for the coming year.\n\nHere are Citi's areas of focus heading into the new year, followed by its top stock picks for each sector.\n\nThesis: Earnings growth among banks and financial services stocks appears to be holding strong heading into 2026.\n\nFor bank stocks in particular, profit margins look \"healthy,\" and the sector is flashing positive trading signals, Citi said. The bank pointed to the sector's positive Relative Strength Index reading, one gauge that measures whether an investment is overbought or oversold.\n\nThesis: The bank said it expects \"lessening policy overhang\" to boost investor sentiment across healthcare, referring to trends like uncertainty around drug pricing fading as more pharma companies make deals with the Trump administration.\n\n\"Revisions have turned positive and the growth outlook for '26 should begin to improve,\" the bank said of the healthcare equipment & services area in particular. \"Insiders have stepped up purchases while sells have declined off recent peak.\"\n\nThesis: Fundamentals across the information technology sector look strong, Citi researchers said, pointing to an \"attractive\" growth setup in the semiconductors space and positive earnings revisions in the software & services area.\n\n\"This is our preferred growth sector given good fundamental trends and revisions.

    "title": "Healthcare VCs predict more AI transparency investment, private equity M&A, and a quiet year for IPOs in 2026",
    "description": "It's been a hot year for healthcare venture investment. Backers said they expect investments in AI cost savings in 2026, plus more M&A — but not IPOs.",
    "fullText": "It's been a hot year for healthcare deals — but some investors are predicting a shift in which startups will capture VC attention next year.\n\n2025 saw a welcome surge in healthcare venture funding as investors rushed to back top AI startups. Last December, VCs predicted huge funding rounds for AI scribe startups like Abridge and Ambience Healthcare; indeed, both Abridge and Ambience landed hundreds of millions of dollars in venture funding this year.\n\nInvestors also said in December 2024 that they anticipated a race for those startups to expand beyond AI health scribing into other product lines, like medical coding and billing. That pressure intensified in August, when medical records giant Epic announced it was releasing its own AI tools, including for clinical documentation, in competition with its closest startup partner Abridge.\n\nWith Epic in the mix and tech giants like OpenAI working on their own healthcare AI plays, VCs told Business Insider that they're expecting different profiles of healthcare startups to grab funding next year as companies focus on cost savings, securing patient and provider trust, and ensuring high-quality data.\n\n\"AI has diffused nicely for passive listening in clinical settings, and administrative simplification,\" said Dan Mendelson, the CEO of Morgan Health, JPMorgan's healthcare investing arm. \"AI now needs to show savings to payers by helping consumers make good choices and reducing the burden on clinicians.\"\n\nInvestors are also watching for more healthcare exits in 2026. Two venture-backed digital health companies went public this year: Hinge Health in May, and Omada Health in June. VCs weren't optimistic that 2026 would bring a deluge of new public healthcare companies, but they're looking forward to what many said should be an active year for healthcare M&A.\n\nThis year, investment surged for AI startups tackling administrative burdens for large health systems. AI scribe startups Abridge and Ambience Healthcare notched $5.3 billion and $1.25 billion valuations, respectively, while AI-powered medical knowledge platform OpenEvidence hit a $6 billion valuation with its own raise.\n\nMany such startups have expanded into coding and billing to help hospitals capture more revenue from health insurers. But in 2026, insurers could use AI to fight back, said Todd Cozzens, cofounder and managing partner of Transformation Capital.\n\nCozzens said that many insurers have already partnered with large organizations such as Palantir and Anthropic on custom AI solutions. Next year, he expects those payers to contract with more specialized AI platforms trained on complex clinical data, like providers are already doing.\n\n\"It's a zero-sum game in the end, but like with the nuclear weapons arms race, a lot of money is going to be spent here, and doing nothing is no longer an option for either side of the battle,\" he said.\n\nSeveral VCs suggested that the next wave of healthcare investment will go toward business models that prioritize higher-quality AI behind the scenes.\n\nSapphire Ventures partner Cathy Gao predicted a conscious shift away from \"black box\" AI models in high-stakes industries like healthcare, calling them \"uninvestable.\"\n\n\"The next healthcare unicorns will be 'glass box' platforms where the core product is the digital paper trail,\" she said. \"Any engineering team can build an AI that fills out a medical form. The real opportunity is building the governance layer that proves why the AI made that decision.\"\n\nLiam Donohue, cofounder and managing partner at .406 Ventures, said his firm has also been investing in companies focused on AI decision transparency and data quality.\n\n\"One of the obstacles that needs to be hurdled for AI to be more widely used in enterprise settings is absolutely the ability to go back to the source of why some process happened or why a decision was made. And there's a lot of infrastructure being built to do that,\" he said.\n\nAs insurers cut reimbursement rates for key services, investors are also expecting a surge in business models that prioritize lower-cost care settings and eschew point solutions, paired with AI to reduce administrative spend.\n\nNorwest partner Irem Rami said she expects a boost for in-home care models that incorporate AI agents. Mercedes Bent, cofounder and partner at Premise VC, is watching healthcare startups that aim to support patients across a chosen specialty, like women's health tech that assists patients from fertility tracking through conception.\n\nTech startups that actually provide healthcare have somewhat fallen out of favor with VCs in recent years. The costs of employing providers or running brick-and-mortar clinics can make it tough for those businesses to deliver venture-style returns.\n\nBut in 2026, according to 7wireVentures partner Alyssa Jaffee, \"tech-enabled services is coming back, baby.\"\n\nAfter 2021's venture boom and the subsequent funding drought, some tech-enabled services companies struggled to maintain their growth or hit their next milestone on slim margins, especially at earlier stages, Jaffee said.\n\nBut many startups that have made it to the other side have stronger businesses as a result, including durable relationships with key customers like health plans, she said.\n\nShe also pointed to Hinge Health and Omada Health's successful IPOs; both companies are tech-enabled service providers that sell to employers and health plans.\n\n\"We have a number of those companies in our portfolio that have really hit their stride. It's just a meatier business, and I think we're going to get a lot of interest from later-stage investors coming in to support those kinds of companies,\" Jaffee said.\n\nNorthzone partner Wendy Xiao said that she's now seeing some employers try out a few different tech-enabled services solutions in a given category, such as GLP-1 management, and test them against one another.\n\nContracting with multiple companies could be a tough sell for employers who are already seeing their healthcare costs skyrocket. But Xiao said many of these startups are paid a portion of the money they save employers — a model that dramatically lowers employers' financial exposure.\n\nThere are a few healthcare companies that could be eyeing the exits next year. Virta Health has publicly said it expects to be IPO-ready in 2026. And Business Insider previously reported that two private-equity-backed healthtech companies, Zelis Healthcare and Ensemble Health, have been in talks with bankers about potential IPOs.\n\nStill, no reports have emerged of venture-backed healthcare startups filing their S-1s. By this time last year, Hinge Health and Omada Health were already deep into their IPO preparations.\n\nWhile Xiao thinks a handful of healthtech startups are waiting for their debuts, she's not confident they'll take the plunge before the second half of 2026.\n\n\"I think they'll probably go out in a similar timeframe of, if not late next year, then the year after. There seems to be a lot of momentum pent up around IPO readiness at the organizational level over the past few years. I think a lot of these companies are in pretty good shape in terms of that, and they're just waiting for one of the larger ones to go out,\" Xiao said.\n\nMichael Greeley, the cofounder and general partner at Flare Capital Partners, agreed that the new year is unlikely to bring a steady stream of new healthcare IPOs. But he's anticipating more M&A activity as interest rates come down and private equity buyers look for healthcare AI acquisitions in the VC world.\n\n\"A lot of us are still sitting on a lot of unrealized gains, and the obsession is going to be heightened around liquidity,\" Greeley said. \"We're seeing a lot more interest from the big buyout funds in our sector, who are going down market to buy AI assets to wrap around their legacy platform companies.\"\n\n2025 saw a few such deals. New Mountain Capital, in particular, made several AI acquisitions this year as the PE firm rolled startups onto its existing healthcare bets. Greeley also pointed to firms such as Bain Capital, TPG, Silver Lake, and KKR as potential buyers in 2026.\n\nDonohue is similarly optimistic that 2026 will bring a flurry of exit activity as more companies mull going public, selling, or merging with a competitor. In particular, he expects strategic buyers, such as health plans, to become more active in the second half of 2026.\n\n\"I actually think it'll be a good exit year. I'm seeing lots of signs of life, both within our portfolio and more broadly. There's a lot of activity percolating that you just haven't seen for the last several years,\" he said.",

    "description": "C-section rates at individual hospitals are hard to find. Search our map by hospital name, city, state, or ZIP code to compare facilities near you.",
    "fullText": "At Valley Baptist Medical Center in Brownsville, Texas, doctors performed C-sections on half of all women with low-risk pregnancies — first-time mothers at full term, carrying a single baby positioned head-down — on average, in a seven-year period.\n\nThat's double the low-risk C-section rate of the next closest hospital, less than 5 miles away.\n\nThe contrast isn't unique to the Rio Grande Valley. Across the country, neighboring hospitals deliver babies at vastly different C-section rates — even when controlling for factors like maternal age, health complications, and whether a hospital treats high-risk pregnancies.\n\nBusiness Insider spent months compiling C-section data from 29 states and Washington, DC, analyzing rates at 1,744 hospitals that collectively deliver around 70% of babies born in the US each year. The result: the first comprehensive, publicly searchable map of hospital C-section rates across the country.\n\nSearch by hospital name, city, state, or ZIP code to see C-section rates at hospitals near you. Click on any hospital to compare its rates with nearby facilities.\n\nHospitals change ownership — and names — frequently. Business Insider used the hospital name provided by each state department of health. Hospital names in our database may have since changed.\n\nThe table shows whether each hospital performs overall C-sections at higher, lower, or similar rates compared to the next closest hospital. Color coding indicates whether a hospital's rate falls above or below the national average for overall, first-time, or low-risk C-section rates in Business Insider's dataset.\n\nFor states that didn't provide low-risk C-section data, the map displays first-time rates. If neither metric was available, it shows overall rates.\n\nThe map displays three types of C-section rates for over 1,700 hospitals:\n\nOverall rates include all C-sections, whether a woman is undergoing her first surgery or has had the procedure before.\n\nFirst-time rates track C-sections performed on women giving birth for the first time — a critical metric since a first C-section almost always leads to more surgeries in later pregnancies.\n\nLow-risk rates measure C-sections performed on women with these lowest-risk pregnancies. Maternal health experts consider this the most authoritative metric for comparing hospitals, since these women are the least likely to need surgery to safely deliver.\n\nThe map reveals dramatic variation. Hospital C-section rates swing from as low as 4% overall at a hospital in Alaska to as high as 62% overall at a hospital in Florida.\n\nBusiness Insider identified 158 hospitals with average low-risk C-section rates at least 25% higher than their nearest neighbor.\n\nMultiple studies show that one of the biggest risk factors for undergoing a medically unnecessary C-section is the hospital where a woman delivers — even when accounting for maternal age, race, health, income, and whether a hospital specializes in high-risk births.\n\nDozens of obstetricians, midwives, and labor nurses told Business Insider that while C-sections are often lifesaving, concerns for maternal health aren't the only influences driving surgery rates. They cited fear of lawsuits, understaffing, and indirect financial incentives; C-sections are more profitable and cost-effective than vaginal deliveries.\n\nThe consequences are serious. Each additional C-section a woman undergoes increases her risk of severe complications like placenta accreta, a life-threatening condition that almost always requires a hysterectomy to prevent hemorrhage.\n\nNot all states have data. Many hospitals don't publicly disclose their C-section rates. Eleven states would not produce data identifying individual hospitals, citing confidentiality policies or saying they don't track the information. Twenty-eight states required formal public records requests, sometimes charging fees reaching $1,500.\n\nRead more about how Business Insider collected hospitals' C-section data here.",

    "description": "Henley & Partners say data shows wealthy families shifting plans as private healthcare costs surge worldwide and cheaper European options gain appeal.",
    "fullText": "A surge in global wealth migration seems to be colliding with an overlooked but increasingly decisive factor: the soaring cost of private healthcare.\n\nHenley & Partners, an investment migration firm, said its client data and new cost comparisons from a global health index show wealthy families are no longer choosing where to live solely on tax or lifestyle, but are increasingly factoring in the long-term cost of private healthcare.\n\nThe firm said in a press release this month that it has received applications from 92 nationalities in 2025, supporting clients across more than 50 residence and citizenship programs.\n\nApplications jumped 43% year-over-year in the first three quarters of 2025 compared with the same period in 2024, it said.\n\n\"Global mobility is becoming a core risk-management strategy for wealthy families,\" said Christian H. Kaelin, the firm's chairman. Clients \"are scrutinizing not only access to residence and citizenship, but also the real cost of sustaining that lifestyle — especially the price of reliable private healthcare.\"\n\n\"Destinations that look attractive on paper can become far less so once true healthcare exposure is understood,\" he added.\n\nHenley & Partners cited the SIP Health Cost Index 2025, from the SIP Medical Family Office in Switzerland, a global benchmark released earlier this month, which ranks 50 countries by the true cost of private healthcare using international private medical insurance (IPMI) premiums as of August 2025.\n\nIn Europe, the UK ($11,726) and Greece ($9,654) sit at the pricier end due in part to insurance taxes, it said. while Switzerland ranks mid-table at $8,912. The UAE ranks 10th globally, with an average of $9,680.\n\nSome of the mid-range markets include South Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Monaco, which range from roughly $7,100 to $7,600.\n\nKevin Bürchler, CEO of SIP Medical Family Office, which is behind the SIP Health Cost Index 2025, said inflation in private healthcare \"is rising worldwide, but the pace and pattern differ dramatically.\"\n\nSpeaking to Business Insider, he pointed to \"value\" destinations such as Italy, Portugal, and Austria, which offer lower costs and proximity to top-tier medical hubs like Switzerland and Germany.\n\nWhile ultra-high-net-worth individuals can absorb steep premiums, the cost gap matters for affluent families, especially those planning toward retirement, he said.\n\n\"It can make a significant difference whether you pay $30,000 plus for private health insurance versus $10,000,\" or whether \"a doctor consultation costs $500 or $50,\" he added.\n\nThat pressure, among other factors, is reshaping behavior, especially among Americans.\n\n\"US citizens were 5% of our client base in 2018, whereas today they comprise 40%,\" Basil Mohr-Elzeki, managing partner at Henley & Partners North America, told Business Insider — a shift he described as part of a broader hedge that includes healthcare resilience.\n\nHe said healthcare costs are explicitly cited in at least 15% of client decisions, making it a top-five factor behind geopolitical risk, global mobility, legacy planning, and tax optimization.\n\nInterest is rising in Portugal, Italy, Greece, Malta, and in cost-effective Latin American options such as Panama and Costa Rica, he said, adding that Turkey also attracts clients for affordable private medical tourism.\n\nMohr-Elzeki said many aging clients are increasingly seeking alternative healthcare options abroad — not only because of the cost, but also to access different medical opinions and treatments outside the US system, which he said, while \"top-tier,\" may have a \"commercial bias.\"\n\nHenley & Partners said the SIP Index is helping clients \"avoid hidden high-cost traps\" as healthcare becomes a central part of global mobility planning.",
