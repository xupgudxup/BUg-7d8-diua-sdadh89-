    "description": "Employers and health systems can do a better job of serving the specific healthcare needs of Millennials and Gen Zers by embracing the following seven approaches: 1) Enlist AI in the design of benefits and the delivery of care; 2) Harness virtual technologies to boost employees’ engagement in choosing and making the most of their healthcare benefits; 3) Shift to prepayment reimbursement models, which emphasize maintaining patients’ health rather than generating revenue when patients become ill; 4) Train physicians to connect with younger patients both technologically and culturally; 5) Combat the physician shortage by supporting educational programs and advocating for legislation to increase residency slots; 6) Treat mental health as an essential part of overall health; and 7) Adopting ways to make care for younger workers more affordable.",

    "description": "When budgets tighten, programs that promote psychological safety—the freedom to speak up without fear of retribution—are often cut. New research shows that’s a mistake. A study of 27,000 healthcare workers during the pandemic found that feeling psychologically safe significantly reduces burnout and turnover, even when resources are severely constrained. Employees who felt safe enough to voice concerns also proved to be  more resilient and more likely to stay in their jobs. Building this “social resource” before a crisis pays dividends when uncertainty spikes.",
