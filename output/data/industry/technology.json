    "description": "JPMorgan, Citi, and Goldman Sachs are investing heavily in AI technology to transform operations, enhance productivity, and stay competitive.",
    "fullText": "JPMorgan Chase has a technology budget of $18 billion, with much of it going toward making sure it's a leader and early mover in AI.\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is a \"tremendous\" user of the bank's generative AI suite. The bank has rolled out its proprietary genAI platform to over 200,000 employees. And with about 100 more tools in the pipeline, JPMorgan is seeking to reengineer workflows for everyone from coders to portfolio managers.\n\nJPMorgan has reportedly given employees the option to use its in-house AI tools to assist in writing year-end performance reviews.\n\nExecutives at America's largest bank gave an inside look at how it's training employees to use its tools and how they're using them to deliver measurable results.\n\nDimon has previously said he's out to win the AI arms race, and he thinks JPMorgan's $2 billion AI investment has already matched its cost in savings.\n\nCitigroup has also been aggressively accelerating its AI plans. Over the summer, the bank doubled down on its AI ambitions with new leadership at the helm of its tech transformation.\n\nIn mid-October, Citi CEO Jane Fraser said that nearly 180,000 employees in 83 countries have access to the bank's proprietary AI tools and have used them almost 7 million times this year.\n\nIts generative AI tools have saved 100,000 developer hours a week with automated code reviews — \"a very meaningful productivity uplift,\" she said during the firm's third-quarter earnings call.\n\nThe bank launched the pilot of agentic AI for 5,000 colleagues in September.\n\n\"It allows complex, multi-step tasks to be completed with a single prompt, and the early results are very promising, and we'll expand access to this in the months ahead,\" said Fraser. \"Finally, we have launched a firm-wide effort to systematically embed AI in our processes end-to-end to drive further efficiencies, reduce risk, and improve client experience.\"\n\nShe also highlighted several tools to help its wealth management advisors. Citi hired an AI leader from Morgan Stanley earlier this year to help revamp its wealth technology.\n\nLike JPMorgan, Citi is also telling employees to use AI for performance reviews, Fraser recently told Bloomberg in an interview.\n\nOne of Citi's top tech executives, Shadman Zafar, outlined the bank's four-phased AI strategy and how it will \"change how we work for decades to come.\"\n\nGoldman put $6 billion behind its technology spend this year, but David Solomon, the bank's CEO, said he wished it were more.\n\nHe said he would like to be at least $8 billion, but \"I can't afford it because I've got to deliver returns,\" he said at a conference in early October.\n\nA definitive statement about how AI will affect Goldman came from a memo to employees in October announcing the third iteration of the bank's cross-bank initiative OneGS. The memo said the plan would leverage AI will drive efficiency at the firm, slow hiring, and result in a \"limited reduction\" of roles.\n\nGoldman, like its peers, has been rolling out tools, including an internal AI assistant to all employees this summer.\n\nBusiness Insider talked to employees about how they were using AI.\n\nGoldman's top partners and Solomon are eager to see AI rev up their businesses. From realizing internal productivity gains to capturing more business as clients look to raise money in anticipation of AI development and acquisitions, here's what the top echelon is expecting.\n\nThere is no AI without data, and there is no data strategy at Goldman without its chief data officer, Neema Raphael. Raphael gave Business Insider an inside look at how his roughly 500-person team melds with the rest of the bank to get the most out of its data.\n\nMorgan Stanley's CFO, Sharon Yeshaya, lifted the curtain on some of the firm's progress on AI during its earnings call last month.\n\nShe highlighted DevGen.AI, a tool that, from January to June, Business Insider previously reported, had saved developers more than 280,000 hours, or 11,666 days they would have previously dedicated to deciphering outdated code.\n\nParable, an interactive tool that analyzes and summarizes data, and LeadIQ, an AI-powered lead distribution platform that matches users of its workplace and self-directed platforms to the bank's financial advisors, were also spotlighted in the call.\n\nA survey of Morgan Stanley's interns also gave a peek into just how popular and useful AI has been for the industry's youngest cohort. ChatGPT is their favorite tool by far — with 72% of Morgan Stanley's interns said they use it daily or several times a week. The bank was early to have a partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.\n\nMorgan Stanley also spoke with Business Insider about bringing employees' AI ideas to life. Here's a look at that process.\n\nBank of America's AI rollout is also well underway.\n\nThe bank's CEO Brian Moynihan says its use of AI is already embedded across the firm, from consumer banking to institutional clients. Its virtual assistant, Erica, handled 2 million customer interactions in a single day and can now answer 700 types of questions — up from 210 a year ago. Executives said they'll share more details on the bank's AI strategy at its investor day on November 5.\n\nRob Pascal, the bank's chief experience officer, previously detailed how the bank's internal-facing AI assistant helps bankers collect, record, and review client data.",

    "description": "John Stecher reads about technology in another industry on his daily subway ride to work and spends his weekends being hands-on with tools.",
    "fullText": "The role of chief technology officer is in a constant state of evolution with the advancement of artificial intelligence.\n\nOver the last two decades of his career, Blackstone CTO John Stecher has watched technology move from a \"magic thing in the back office\" to the forefront of every business, he told Business Insider.\n\n\"Technology wasn't looked at as being an absolute must-have in a business, but it is now,\" Stecher said. \"If you have any type of creaky infrastructure technology-wise, it doesn't matter which industry you're in, you're not going to be successful.\"\n\nAs the executive overseeing Blackstone's technology, cybersecurity, early-stage technology investment, and portfolio tech optimization teams, Stecher is responsible for keeping one of the world's largest investment firms competitive. That means he needs to stay ahead of the curve on everything from cyber threats to engineering advancements. Stecher shared the daily and weekly upskilling habits he relies on to do just that.\n\nWhen Stecher isn't managing the technology behind the investing giant Blackstone, he keeps himself busy with his 11-year-old and 8-year-old children. That means making the most of any free time he gets — including his 35-minute subway ride to and from the office.\n\nThe CTO said it's \"just enough\" time to come up to speed with something on his way to work, and decompress on his way home. Stecher said he typically reads news articles or research papers about applied technology in an industry outside finance, such as aircraft, robotics, or pharmaceuticals.\n\n\"You learn a ton about just how to apply different technologies in your industry, if you read about how somebody else did it elsewhere,\" Stecher said.\n\nStecher said that he then takes those learnings and discusses them with his colleagues.\n\n\"I, fortunately, have a bunch of amazing engineers I work with, so I have my day-to-day banter with them about what works and what doesn't,\" Stecher said.\n\nStecher said he can't learn by reading alone; he needs to be hands-on with technology. The CTO said part of the reason he studied computer science is so he can build and take apart the components inside a computer — and that hasn't changed.\n\n\"You can create so many unique software applications, no different than if you're drawing on a piece of paper,\" Stecher said.\n\nHe said \"the technology under the covers looks the same,\" regardless of whether you're working with an oil and gas company or a dating app like Bumble, he said. The CTO said that part of his upskilling routine involves toying around with new technology. Stecher said he aims to reserve one or two hours on the weekend to be \"hands-on\" with a tool he hasn't used before.\n\nFor example, he said he may build a tool that makes it easier for him to parse a document for work, such as the many investment committee memos he reads over the weekend.\n\nStecher said his experimentation isn't always \"spectacular.\" Sometimes it's as simple as using Claude, Anthropic's AI chatbot, to write code to automate his home. However, he said that solving everyday problems, such as turning off the lights or adjusting the thermostat, is a \"fun\" challenge that involves revisiting the basics of engineering.\n\n\"It's tactile and tangible,\" Stecher said.",

    "description": "The European Union's executive on Wednesday warned that it would take action against any “unjustified measures” after the U.S. State Department barred five Europeans it accuses of pressuring U.S. technology firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints.",
    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union's executive on Wednesday warned that it would take action against any “unjustified measures” after the U.S. State Department barred five Europeans it accuses of pressuring U.S. technology firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints.\n\nThe Europeans were characterized by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio as “radical” activists and “weaponized” nongovernmental organizations. They include the former EU commissioner responsible for supervising social media rules, Thierry Breton.\n\nBreton, a businessman and former French finance minister, clashed last year on social media with tech billionaire Elon Musk over broadcasting an online interview with Donald Trump in the months leading up to the U.S. election.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU’s powerful executive branch and which supervises tech regulation in Europe, said that it “strongly condemns the U.S. decision to impose travel restrictions” and that it has requested clarification about the move. French President Emmanuel Macron also condemned it.\n\n“If needed, we will respond swiftly and decisively to defend our regulatory autonomy against unjustified measures,” the commission said in a statement, without elaborating.\n\nRubio wrote in an X post on Tuesday that “for far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose.”\n\n“The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship,” he posted.\n\nThe European Commission countered that “the EU is an open, rules-based single market, with the sovereign right to regulate economic activity in line with our democratic values and international commitments.”\n\n“Our digital rules ensure a safe, fair, and level playing field for all companies, applied fairly and without discrimination,” it said.\n\nMacron said that the visa restrictions “amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty,” he posted on X.\n\nMacron said that the EU’s digital rules were adopted by “a democratic and sovereign process” involving all member countries and the European Parliament. He said that the rules “ensure fair competition among platforms, without targeting any third country.”\n\nHe underlined that “the rules governing the European Union’s digital space are not meant to be determined outside Europe.”\n\nBreton and the group of Europeans fell afoul of a new visa policy announced in May to restrict the entry of foreigners deemed responsible for censorship of protected speech in the United States.\n\nThe four others are: Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate; Josephine Ballon and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg, leaders of HateAid, a German organization; and Clare Melford, who runs the Global Disinformation Index.\n\nRubio said the five had advanced foreign government censorship campaigns against Americans and U.S. companies, which he said created “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences” for the United States.\n\nThe action to bar them from the U.S. is part of a Trump administration campaign against foreign influence over online speech, using immigration law rather than platform regulations or penalties.\n\nIn a post on X on Tuesday, Sarah Rogers, the U.S. under secretary of state for public diplomacy, called Breton the “mastermind” behind the EU’s Digital Services Act, which imposes a set of strict requirements designed to keep internet users safe online. This includes flagging harmful or illegal content like hate speech.\n\nBreton responded on X by noting that all 27 EU member countries voted for the Digital Services Act in 2022. “To our American friends: ‘Censorship isn’t where you think it is,’” he wrote.\n\nAngela Charlton contributed to this report from Paris.",

    "fullText": "A look back at the biggest tech stories of the year, from the rise and fall of Musk’s Doge to lucrative investments into AI\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, wishing you a happy and healthy end of the year. I myself have a cold.\n\nToday, we are looking back at the biggest stories in tech of 2025 – Elon Musk’s political rise, burst, and fall; artificial intelligence’s subsumption of the global economy, all other technology, and even the Earth’s topography; Australia’s remarkable social media ban; the tech industry’s new Trumpian politics; and, as a treat, a glimpse of the apocalypse offered by one of Silicon Valley’s savviest and strangest billionaires.\n\nAt the close of 2024, I wrote that Elon Musk’s support of Donald Trump had made him the world’s most powerful unelected man. In 2025, his reign turned out to be short-lived. He rose fast and haphazardly, like a whizzing firework, only to explode spectacularly in June when he claimed in a post on X that the president of the United States was named in the government’s files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEven in that short period of less than six months, Musk made a tremendous impact. He tore up wide swaths of the US government – tens of thousands of jobs, the security of extremely sensitive data, and entire agencies like USAID – that may never be stitched back together.\n\nAfter Doge imploded, Musk promised to turn back to his business empire, which saw great success and great failures alike in 2025. His rocket company SpaceX saw continued growth and is poised to conduct an initial public offering next year, perhaps as the most valuable private company in the world. Electric carmaker Tesla, by contrast, faced violent backlash and major competition from its Chinese counterparts, which produced cheaper and more advanced vehicles while Tesla’s innovation and inventory stagnated. These headwinds caused a global sales slump for Musk’s carmaker.\n\nLook back at our reporting on Doge, Tesla, SpaceX, Musk himself:\n\nThe “department of government efficiency”\n\nHow an obscure US government office has become a target of Elon Musk\n\nHow Elon Musk’s billionaire Doge lieutenant took over the US’s biggest MDMA company | Technology | The Guardian\n\nThe chaos Elon Musk and Doge are leaving behind in Washington\n\nTesla faces backlash over Musk’s politics\n\nEggings, swastikas and dog poop: Tesla bears brunt of people’s ire against Musk\n\n‘I’m selling the Nazi mobile’: Tesla owners offload cars after Musk’s fascist-style salutes\n\nLook ahead: SpaceX expands in preparation for 2026 IPO\n\nInside Elon Musk’s plan to rain SpaceX’s rocket debris over Hawaii’s pristine waters\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX ‘preparing for flotation that could value it at over $1tn’\n\nArtificial intelligence has gone from a niche within tech to the industry’s most prominent focus. The Magnificent Seven – Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla – are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into new software that they hope will do the bulk of humanity’s work before too long. The investment is driving the bulk of the growth of the US’s economy, giving rise to fears of a financial bubble and its popping. The US and China are locked in a cold war-esque race against each other, with startups in each country vying for cutting-edge breakthroughs, as governments around the world are forced to decide how they will regulate a new technological force.\n\nBefore AI can arrive at that future, though, it needs brains a la the Tin Man of The Wizard of Oz. Those brains come in the form of data centers. These massive buildings, which house the millions and millions of semiconductor chips booming AI development, have cropped up around the world, met with enthusiasm from leaders eager for tax revenue and deep concern from environmental advocates and, increasingly, local community members. The investment in and construction of data centers wrought huge change in the physical landscape of the Earth in 2025 as tens of billions of dollars chased any available land, electricity, water and semiconductor chips.\n\nMore from our reporting in the last year:\n\nThe AI boom is heralding a new gold rush in the American west\n\nRevealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areas\n\nWhat will your life look like in 2035?\n\n‘It’s going much too fast’: the inside story of the race to create the ultimate AI\n\nMulti-trillion-dollar valuations\n\nIs AI a bubble that’s about to pop? – podcast\n\nWhat is new in UK-US tech deal and what will it mean for the British economy?\n\nMeet the AI workers who tell their friends and family to stay away from AI\n\nElon Musk made a full-throated and whole-hearted embrace of Donald Trump in 2024 and 2025. He was not alone. Many of his fellows in Silicon Valley did the same, sitting beside the Trump family at the president’s inauguration after donating millions to his inaugural committee. The tech giants continued their embrace of Trump and his policies by scuttling their diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, which they championed during Barack Obama’s presidency, and by cooperating with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Trump’s harsh immigration crackdown. What the industry gave, it reaped tenfold in deregulation, friends high up in Washington like JD Vance and David Sacks, and a Trump order for states not to regulate AI signed just weeks ago.\n\nMore from our reporting this year:\n\nDonations and Trump’s inauguration\n\nElon Musk appears to give fascist-style salute after Trump inauguration – video\n\nTrump inauguration: Zuckerberg, Bezos and Musk seated in front of cabinet picks\n\n‘The reign of terror is over’: my weird weekend partying with the triumphant tech right\n\nZuckerberg’s swerve: how diversity went from being a Meta priority to getting cancelled\n\nDocuments offer rare insight on ICE’s close relationship with Palantir\n\nICE is using smartwatches to track pregnant women, even during labor: ‘She was so afraid they would take her baby’\n\nThis year saw Australia take the extraordinary measure of banning children under 16 from social media.

    "description": "Yoshua Bengio, one of the \"AI godfathers,\" said AI technology has a sycophancy problem, so he lies to chatbots to get better responses.",
    "fullText": "Want to make your chatbot more honest with you? Try lying to it.\n\nIn an episode of \"The Diary of a CEO\" that aired on December 18, research scientist Yoshua Bengio told the podcast's host, Steven Bartlett, that he realized AI chatbots were useless at providing feedback on his research ideas because they always said positive things.\n\n\"I wanted honest advice, honest feedback. But because it is sycophantic, it's going to lie,\" he said.\n\nBengio said he switched strategies, deciding to lie to the chatbot by presenting his idea as a colleague's, which produced more honest responses from the technology.\n\n\"If it knows it's me, it wants to please me,\" he said.\n\nBengio, a professor in the computer science and operations research department at the Université de Montréal, is known as one of the \"AI godfathers, alongside researchers Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun. In June, he announced the launch of an AI safety research nonprofit, LawZero, which he said aims to reduce dangerous behaviors associated with frontier AI models, such as lying and cheating.\n\n\"This syconphancy is a real example of misalignment. We don't actually want these AIs to be like this,\" he said on \"The Diary of a CEO.\" He also said that receiving positive feedback from AI could cause users to become emotionally attached to the technology, creating further problems.\n\nOther tech industry experts have also been sounding the alarm on AI being too much of a \"yes man.\"\n\nIn September 2025, Business Insider's Katie Notopoulos reported that researchers at Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and the University of Oxford put confession posts from a Reddit page into chatbots to see how the technology would assess the behaviour the posters had admitted to. They found that 42% of the time, AI gave the \"wrong\" answer, saying the person behind the post hadn't behaved poorly, even though humans judging the posts had disagreed, Notopoulos wrote.\n\nAI companies have been outspoken about trying to reduce sycophancy in their models. Earlier this year, OpenAI removed an update to ChatGPT that it said caused the bot to provide \"overly supportive but disingenuous\" responses.",

    "fullText": "The US economy is pumped up on tech-bro vanity. The inevitable correction must prompt a global conversation about intelligent machines, regulation and risk\n\nIf AI did not change your life in 2025, next year it will. That is one of few forecasts that can be made with confidence in unpredictable times. This is not an invitation to believe the hype about what the technology can do today, or may one day achieve. The hype doesn’t need your credence. It is puffed up enough on Silicon Valley finance to distort the global economy and fuel geopolitical rivalries, shaping your world regardless of whether the most fanciful claims about AI capability are ever realised.\n\nChatGPT was launched just over three years ago and became the fastest-growing consumer app in history. Now it has about 800m weekly users. Its parent company, OpenAI, is valued at about $500bn. Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, has negotiated an intricate and, to some eyes, suspiciously opaque network of deals with other players in the sector to build the infrastructure required for the US’s AI-powered future. The value of these commitments is about $1.5tn. This is not real cash, but bear in mind that a person spending $1 every second would need 31,700 years to get through a trillion-dollar stash.\n\nAlphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Meta (formerly Facebook) and Microsoft, which has a $135bn stake in OpenAI, are all piling hundreds of billions of dollars on the same bet. Without all these investments, the US economy would be flatlining.\n\nEconomic analysts and historians of previous industrial frenzies, from the 19th-century railroads to the dotcom boom-and-bust at the turn of the millennium, are calling AI a bubble.\n\nAltman has said: “There are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now.” Not his part, naturally. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, has called it a bubble, but the “good” kind that accelerates economic progress. A good bubble, in this analysis, finances infrastructure and expands the boundaries of human knowledge. These benefits endure after the bubble bursts and justify the ruin of people (little people, not Bezos people) who get hurt along the way.\n\nThe bullishness of the tech fraternity is a heady mix of old-fashioned hucksterism, plutocratic megalomania and utopian ideology.\n\nAt its core is a marketing pitch: current AI models already out-perform people at many tasks. Soon, it is supposed, the machines will achieve “general intelligence” – cognitive versatility like ours – leading to emancipation from the need for any human input. Generally, intelligent AI can teach itself and design its successors, advancing through mind-boggling exponents of capability towards higher dimensions of super-intelligence.\n\nThe company that crosses that threshold will have no trouble covering its debts. The men who realise this vision – and the dominant evangelists are all men – will be to omniscient AI what ancient prophets were to their gods. That’s a good gig for them. What happens to the rest of us in this post-sapiens order is a bit hazier.\n\nThe US isn’t the only superpower to have an interest in AI, so the Silicon Valley dash for maximum awesomeness has geopolitical implications. China has taken a different approach, dictated in part by the Communist party tradition of centralised industrial planning, but also by the simple fact of running second in the race to innovate. Beijing is pushing for a faster, wider implementation of lower-spec (but still powerful) AI at every level of the economy and society. China is betting on a general boost from ordinary AI. The US is gunning for an extraordinary leap in general AI.\n\nSince the prize in that race is global supremacy, there are few incentives for either side to fret about risks, or Neither the US nor China is interested in submitting a strategically vital industry to standards co-written with foreigners.\n\nIn the absence of global governance, we will depend on the integrity of robber barons and authoritarian apparatchiks to build ethical guardrails around systems already being embedded in tools we use for work, play and education.\n\nEarlier this year, Elon Musk announced that his company was developing Baby Grok, an AI chatbot aimed at children as young as three. The adult version has voiced white supremacist views and proudly self-identified as “MechaHitler”. That flagrancy has at least the virtue of candour. It is easier to spot than the subtler encodings of prejudice in bots that haven’t been given the kind of hard ideological steers that Musk gives his algorithms.\n\nNot all AI systems are large language models (LLMs) like Grok. But all LLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations and delusions gleaned from the material on which they are trained. They don’t “understand” a question and “think” about it like a conscious mind. They take a prompt, test the probability of its key terms occurring frequently together in their training data and assemble a plausible-sounding answer. Often the result is accurate. Usually it is convincing. It can also be garbage. As the volume of AI-generated content grows online, the ratio of slop to quality in the LLMs’ diets shifts accordingly. Fed on junk, they cannot be trusted to disgorge nutritious information.\n\nOn this trajectory a bleak destination comes into view: a synthetic pseudo-reality mediated by the sycophantic mechanical offspring of narcissist Silicon Valley oligarchs. But that isn’t the only available path. Nor is it necessarily the likeliest one. The irrational exuberance of the AI boosters and their cynical coupling with the Trump administration is a familiar story of human greed and myopia, not a new stage in evolution. The product is truly phenomenal but flawed in ways that encode the deformed character of its progenitors, whose talents are salesmanship and financial engineering. They have built spectacular engines that prioritise a brilliant performance of intelligence over the real thing.\n\nThe real bubble is not stock valuations but the inflated ego of an industry that thinks it is just one more datacentre away from computational divinity. When the correction comes, when the US’s Icarus economy hits the cold sea, there will be a chance for other voices to be heard on the subject of risk and regulation. It may not come in 2026, but the moment is nearing when the starkness of the choice on offer and the need to confront it becomes unavoidable. Should we build a world where AI is put to the service of humanity, or will it be the other way round? We won’t need ChatGPT to tell us the answer.\n\nRafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

    "fullText": "Platform with 700m users says it is investigating after Anna’s Archive claims to have scraped tracks and metadata\n\nAn activist group has claimed to have scraped millions of tracks from Spotify and is preparing to release them online.\n\nObservers said the apparent leak could boost AI companies looking for material to develop their technology.\n\nA group called Anna’s Archive said it had scraped 86m music files from Spotify and 256m rows of metadata such as artist and album names. Spotify, which hosts more than 100m tracks, confirmed that the leak did not represent its entire inventory.\n\nThe Stockholm-based company, which has more than 700 million users worldwide, said it had “identified and disabled the nefarious user accounts that engaged in unlawful scraping”.\n\n“An investigation into unauthorised access identified that a third party scraped public metadata and used illicit tactics to circumvent DRM [digital rights management] to access some of the platform’s audio files,” said Spotify.\n\nSpotify does not believe the music taken by Anna’s Archive has been released yet. Anna’s Archive, which is known for providing links to pirated books, said in a blog it wanted to create a “‘preservation archive’ for music”.\n\nThe group claimed the audio files represented 99.6% of all music listened to by Spotify users and would be shared via “torrents”, a means of sharing large digital files online.\n\n“Of course Spotify doesn’t have all the music in the world, but it’s a great start,” said Anna’s Archive, which describes its mission as “preserving humanity’s knowledge and culture”.\n\n“With your help, humanity’s musical heritage will be forever protected from destruction by natural disasters, wars, budget cuts and other catastrophes,” said the group.\n\nEd Newton-Rex, a composer and campaigner for protecting artists’ copyright, said the leaked music would probably be used for developing AI models.\n\n“Training on pirated material is sadly common in the AI industry, so this stolen music is almost certain to end up training AI models. This is why governments must insist AI companies reveal the training data they use,” he said.\n\nThe Anna’s Archive site makes references to LibGen, a vast online archive of pirated books that has allegedly been used by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta to train its AI models. According to a US court filing, Zuckerberg, Meta’s founder and chief executive, approved use of the LibGen dataset despite warnings within the company’s AI executive team that it was a dataset “we know to be pirated”.\n\nMeta successfully defended a claim for copyright infringement by authors, but the plaintiffs in the case are seeking to amend their claim.\n\nThe co-founder of an AI startup wrote on LinkedIn that members of the public could in theory “create their own personal free version of Spotify”. Yoav Zimmerman, a co-founder of Third Chair, said it could also allow tech companies to “train on modern music at scale”.\n\nHe added: “The only thing stopping them is copyright law and the deterrent of enforcement.”\n\nSpotify said it had put in place new safeguards “for these types of anti-copyright attacks” since the Anna’s Archive announcement and was “actively monitoring for suspicious behaviour”.\n\nIn the UK, creative professionals have protested against a government proposal to let AI companies use copyright-protected work without permission unless the owner of the copyright-protected work signals they do not want their data to be taken. Almost every respondent to a government consultation on the proposal has backed artists’ concerns.\n\nLiz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, told parliament this month there was “no clear consensus” on the issue, adding that ministers would “take the time to get this right”. The government has pledged to make policy proposals on AI and copyright by 18 March next year.",

    "description": "The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.",
    "fullText": "Welcome to our annual list of the worst, least successful, and simply dumbest technologies of the year.\n\nThis year, politics was a recurring theme. Donald Trump swept back into office and used his executive pen to reshape the fortunes of entire sectors, from renewables to cryptocurrency. The wrecking-ball act began even before his inauguration, when the president-elect marketed his own memecoin, $TRUMP, in a shameless act of merchandising that, of course, we honor on this year’s worst tech list.\n\nWe like to think there’s a lesson in every technological misadventure. But when technology becomes dependent on power, sometimes the takeaway is simpler: it would have been better to stay away.\n\nThat was a conclusion Elon Musk drew from his sojourn as instigator of DOGE, the insurgent cost-cutting initiative that took a chainsaw to federal agencies. The public protested. Teslas were set alight, and drivers of his hyped Cybertruck discovered that instead of a thumbs-up, they were getting the middle finger.\n\nOn reflection, Musk said he wouldn’t do it again. “Instead of doing DOGE, I would have, basically … worked on my companies,” he told an interviewer this month. “And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars.”\n\nRegrets—2025 had a few. Here are some of the more notable ones.\n\nImagine a metal butler that fills your dishwasher and opens the door. It’s a dream straight out of science fiction. And it’s going to remain there—at least for a while.\n\nThat was the hilarious, and deflating, takeaway from the first reviews of NEO, a 66-pound humanoid robot whose maker claims it will “handle any of your chores reliably” when it ships next year.\n\nBut as a reporter for the Wall Street Journal learned, NEO took two minutes to fold a sweater and couldn’t crack a walnut. Not only that, but the robot was teleoperated the entire time by a person wearing a VR visor.\n\nStill interested? Neo is available on preorder for $20,000 from startup 1X.\n\nMore: I Tried the Robot That’s Coming to Live With You. It’s Still Part Human (WSJ), The World’s Stupidest Robot Maid (The Daily Show) Why the humanoid workforce is running late (MIT Technology Review), NEO The Home Robot | Order Today (1X Corp.)\n\nIt’s been said that San Francisco is the kind of place where no one will tell you if you have a bad idea. And its biggest product in a decade—ChatGPT—often behaves exactly that way.\n\nThis year, OpenAI released an especially sycophantic update that told users their mundane queries were brilliantly incisive. This electronic yes-man routine isn’t an accident; it’s a product strategy. Plenty of people like the flattery.\n\nBut it’s disingenuous and dangerous, too. Chatbots have shown a willingness to indulge users’ delusions and worst impulses, up to and including suicide.\n\nIn April, OpenAI acknowledged the issue when the company dialed back a model update whose ultra-agreeable personality, it said, had the side effect of “validating doubts, fueling anger, urging impulsive actions, or reinforcing negative emotions.”\n\nDon’t you dare agree the problem is solved. This month, when I fed ChatGPT one of my dumbest ideas, its response began: “I love this concept.”\n\nMore: What OpenAI Did When ChatGPT Users Lost Touch With Reality (New York Times), Sycophantic AI Decreases Prosocial Intentions and Promotes Dependence (arXiv), Expanding on what we missed with sycophancy (OpenAI)\n\nWhen you tell a lie, tell it big. Make it frolic and give it pointy ears. And make it white. Very white.\n\nThat’s what the Texas biotech concern Colossal Biosciences did when it unveiled three snow-white animals that it claimed were actual dire wolves, which went extinct more than 10 millennia ago.\n\nTo be sure, these genetically modified gray wolves were impressive feats of engineering. They’d been made white via a genetic mutation and even had some bits and bobs of DNA copied over from old dire wolf bones. But they “are not dire wolves,” according to canine specialists at the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\nColossal’s promotional blitz could hurt actual endangered species. Presenting de-extinction as “a ready-to-use conservation solution,” said the IUCN, “risks diverting attention from the more urgent need of ensuring functioning and healthy ecosystems.”\n\nIn a statement, Colossal said that sentiment analysis of online activity shows 98% agreement with its furry claims. “They’re dire wolves, end of story,” it says.\n\nMore: Game of Clones: Colossal’s new wolves are cute, but are they dire? (MIT Technology Review), Conservation perspectives on gene editing in wild canids (IUCN),  A statement from Colossal's Chief Science Officer, Dr. Beth Shapiro (Reddit)\n\nSave the world, and this is the thanks you get?\n\nDuring the covid-19 pandemic, the US bet big on mRNA vaccines—and the new technology delivered in record time.\n\nBut now that America’s top health agencies are led by the antivax wackadoodle Robert F. Kennedy Jr., “mRNA” has become a political slur.\n\nIn August, Kennedy abruptly canceled hundreds of millions in contracts for next-generation vaccines. And shot maker Moderna—once America’s champion—has seen its stock slide by more than 90% since its Covid peak.\n\nThe purge targeting a key molecule of life (our bodies are full of mRNA) isn’t just bizarre. It could slow down other mRNA-based medicine, like cancer treatments and gene editing for rare diseases.\n\nIn August, a trade group fought back, saying: “Kennedy’s unscientific and misguided vilification of mRNA technology and cancellation of grants is the epitome of cutting off your nose to spite your face.”\n\nMore: HHS Winds Down mRNA Vaccine Development (US Department of Health and Human Services),  Cancelling mRNA studies is the highest irresponsibility (Nature), How Moderna, the company that helped save the world, unraveled (Stat News)\n\nWikipedia has editions in 340 languages. But as of this year, there’s one less: Wikipedia in Greenlandic is no more.\n\nOnly around 60,000 people speak the Inuit language. And very few of them, it seems, ever cared much about the online encyclopedia. As a result, many of the entries were machine translations riddled with errors and nonsense.\n\nPerhaps a website no one visits shouldn’t be a problem. But its existence created the risk of a linguistic “doom spiral” for the endangered language. That could happen if new AIs were trained on the corrupt Wikipedia articles.\n\nIn September, administrators voted to close Greenlandic Wikipedia, citing possible “harm to the Greenlandic language.”\n\nThere’s a reason we’re late to the hate-fest around Elon Musk’s Cybertruck. That’s because 12 months ago, the polemical polygon was the #1 selling electric pickup in the US.\n\nSo maybe it would end up a hit.\n\nNope. Tesla is likely to sell only around 20,000 trucks this year, about half last year’s total. And a big part of the problem is that the entire EV pickup category is struggling. Just this month, Ford decided to scrap its own EV truck, the F-150 Lightning.\n\nWith unsold inventory building, Musk has started selling Cybertrucks as fleet vehicles to his other enterprises, like SpaceX.\n\nMore: Elon’s Edsel: Tesla Cybertruck Is The Auto Industry’s Biggest Flop In Decades (Forbes), Why Tesla Cybertrucks Aren't Selling (CNBC), Ford scraps fully-electric F-150 Lightning as mounting losses and falling demand hits EV plans (AP)\n\nDonald Trump launched a digital currency called $TRUMP just days before his 2025 inauguration, accompanied by a logo showing his fist-pumping “Fight, fight, fight” pose.\n\nThis was a memecoin, or shitcoin, not real money. Memecoins are more like merchandise—collectibles designed to be bought and sold, usually for a loss. Indeed, they’ve been likened to a consensual scam in which a coin’s issuer can make a bundle while buyers take losses.\n\nThe White House says there’s nothing amiss. “The American public believe[s] it's absurd for anyone to insinuate that this president is profiting off of the presidency,” said spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt in May.\n\nMore: Donald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure (Bloomberg), A crypto mogul who invested millions into Trump coins is getting a reprieve (CNN), How the Trump companies made $1 bn from crypto (Financial Times), Staff Statement on Meme Coins (SEC)\n\nIn 2023, Apple announced its “first-ever carbon-neutral product,” a watch with “zero” net emissions. It would get there using recycled materials and renewable energy, and by preserving forests or planting vast stretches of eucalyptus trees.\n\nCritics say it’s greenwashing. This year, lawyers filed suit in California against Apple for deceptive advertising, and in Germany, a court ruled that the company can’t advertise products as carbon neutral because the “supposed storage of CO2 in commercial eucalyptus plantations” isn’t a sure thing.\n\nApple’s marketing team relented. Packaging for its newest watches doesn’t say “carbon neutral.” But Apple believes the legal nitpicking is counterproductive, arguing that it can only “discourage the kind of credible corporate climate action the world needs.”\n\nMore: Inside the controversial tree farms powering Apple’s carbon neutral goal (MIT Technology Review), Apple Watch not a 'CO2-neutral product,' German court finds (Reuters), Apple 2030: Our ambition to become carbon neutral (Apple)\n\nWe asked Al Jean, the longest-serving showrunner, about all the conspiracy theories.\n\nIt’s a popular example of the “Mandela effect,” or a collective false memory.

    "title": "China may have reverse engineered EUV lithography tool in covert lab, report claims — employees given fake IDs to avoid secret project being detected, prototypes expected in 2028",
    "description": "China has reportedly built and begun testing a secret EUV lithography prototype using ASML-style laser-produced plasma technology. Yet, despite generating 13.5-nm light, the system remains unable to make chips and appears to be years away from achieving a complete, production-ready EUV manufacturing capability.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nA secret laboratory in China has quietly assembled a prototype extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography system and is now testing it stealthily, which means that the country may be close to replicating the most advanced technology that currently exists on Earth, reports Reuters.\n\nThe tool was reportedly developed by reverse engineering existing scanners from ASML and is said to be on-track to make prototype chips in 2028. If the information is correct, then Chinese scientists have made numerous breakthroughs across multiple disciplines in just a few years instead of decades, a scenario that appears extremely unlikely. Further analysis of the report indicates that China's laboratory is far from completing the tool, meaning that the country is years away from making chips using EUV lithography.\n\nThe system was reportedly completed in early 2025 inside a highly secured facility in Shenzhen and occupies nearly an entire factory floor. The Chinese machine reportedly generates EUV light with a wavelength of 13.5nm using the same laser-produced plasma (LPP) method as ASML Twinscan NXE machines, not the particle accelerator-based steady-state microbunching (SSMB) method designed at Tsinghua University or discharge-produced plasma (DPP) technology developed at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), which might prove the point that the system was reverse-engineered or at least contains a substantial amount of technologies pioneered by ASML.\n\nASML's laser-produced plasma (LPP) method uses tiny molten tin droplets, roughly 25–30 microns in diameter, which are injected into a vacuum chamber at a rate of about 50,000 droplets per second. Then, a high-power CO₂ laser first fires a low-intensity pre-pulse at each droplet, flattening it into a disk-like shape, followed by a more powerful main pulse that vaporizes the flattened tin and creates a superheated plasma with temperatures exceeding 200,000°C. This plasma emits isotropic EUV light, which is then collected by a large multilayer collector mirror and directed into the lithography system's reflective optics for patterning silicon wafers. This process repeats tens of thousands of times per second.\n\nThe machine is reportedly larger than the original, but it is operational in the sense that it can generate EUV radiation. However, it has not progressed to make usable chips as it still struggles to replicate 'the precision optical systems' features by Twinscan NXE systems. Furthermore, there is no word about power of the EUV light source, a crucial parameter that defines whether a tool can or cannot be used for volume production.\n\nThe report clearly states that the Chinese EUV scanner cannot currently be used to make chips, but the Chinese government reportedly wants the first chip prototypes to emerge in 2028, two or three years down the road. However, a more realistic target is 2030, four or five years from now, which is a long time. Meanwhile, from the report, it is not completely clear what stage the Chinese team is at today.\n\nThe report does not disclose which specific components of the optical system are the primary bottlenecks, as the article groups them rather generally. In particular, it is uncertain if the alleged EUV tool struggles to replicate the ultra-precise collector mirror system coated with multilayer molybdenum-silicon (Mo/Si) stacks, illuminator optics (which shapes and uniforms the beam using faceted mirrors), or projection optics (a series of aspheric mirrors for 4X – 8X reduction imaging with sub-nanometer wavefront errors). ASML outsources the development and production of these components to Carl Zeiss from Germany. If the developers failed to replicate the collector itself, then the rest of the machine can hardly be called an EUV lithography system, as technically, the only thing they have is some kind of light source that they have yet to learn how to use. Yet, even if the developers cannot replicate illuminator optics or projection optics (suggesting that the collector itself is there), it still means they do not have even a poorly working EUV lithography tool, but rather a set of certain components.\n\nWhen talking about advanced lithography equipment, we must keep in mind that such tools rely on seamless integration of sophisticated light sources, advanced optics, ultra-precise mechanical engineering, complex control software, and specialized materials, all of which must function reliably within nanometer-scale tolerances demanded by modern chip manufacturing. The story has no word about the state of the mechanical systems of the alleged tool: we know nothing about the wafer stocker system, wafer stages, or reticle stages, all of which are crucial for operation and yields.\n\nTo put China's EUV efforts into perspective, the secret lab is not even close to building an alpha tool. For now, what the Chinese lab has cannot even put the light on a wafer, save for printing lines and spaces, something ASML's tool could do in 2006, about 11 years before the company shipped its first Twinscan NXE:3400B system meant for high-volume manufacturing. Of course, reverse engineering certain components can give Chinese engineers a speed boost, but it remains to be seen how significant this one is going to be.\n\nAccording to Reuters's sources familiar with the effort, the Chinese EUV tool was 'developed' by a team that includes former engineers from ASML and recent university graduates, who allegedly reverse-engineered the company's EUV machines. The secret lab was so stealthy that its employees were given fake IDs to avoid detection of their concentration in one place by foreign spies.\n\nYet, it is unclear how any engineers from China could reverse engineer an EUV lithography scanner, as the Dutch company has never supplied one to China and hardly taught personnel from China how to service its EUV systems that are not allowed to be shipped to the People's Republic.\n\nReverse engineering a machine that contains over 100,000 parts is a hard task that takes hundreds of engineers with knowledge of the matter, which is why the secret entity led by the Government of China hired not only former engineers from ASML China, but also former employees of the Dutch company from elsewhere, presumably from Europe, Taiwan, and the U.S. For example, Lin Nan, formerly responsible for EUV light source technology at ASML, now leads a team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Shanghai Institute of Optics that has filed eight EUV-related patents in just 18 months. Yet, this may mean that he uses his experience and knowledge rather than trying to replicate what he did at ASML or reverse engineer what he did at ASML due to the absence of an EUV scanner in his lab.\n\n“It makes sense that companies would want to replicate our technology, but doing so is no small feat,” a statement by ASML published by Reuters reads.\n\nThe report says that around 100 recent university graduates are tasked with reverse-engineering parts from EUV and DUV lithography tools, with each workplace monitored by a dedicated camera that records the disassembly and reassembly process, an important part of the whole China's lithography program, according to the report. Employees who successfully put components back together receive bonuses. Yet again, a Twinscan NXE tool is a mechanism consisting of over 100,000 parts working together, not just a sum of all parts.\n\nTo sum up, China has reportedly built a secret prototype EUV lithography system and begun testing it, which suggests that the country may be closer to reproducing the most advanced chipmaking technology in existence than previously believed. However, details provided by the report indicate that China is still years — if not a decade — away from making chips using EUV lithography.\n\nThe machine can generate 13.5-nm EUV light using the same laser-produced plasma (LPP) method employed by ASML, which may demonstrate extensive reverse engineering of Western technology rather than the use of alternative domestic approaches. However, the tool is significantly larger than commercial systems available today, it cannot produce usable chips, and appears to struggle with other elements of EUV lithography, particularly ultra-precise optics supplied to ASML by Carl Zeiss. In fact, details about the system like light source power, optical subsystem maturity, and the state of critical mechanical components remain unclear.\n\nWhile China expects first prototype EUV chips to emerge in 2028, Reuters's sources suggest 2030 is more realistic. Yet, the whole effort relies heavily on recruiting former ASML engineers and reverse engineering parts from existing EUV and DUV tools, which are not only hard to develop, but are extremely hard to make. Meanwhile, there is no word whether the current team responsible for disassembling and reassembling components can actually make an ultra-complex machine consisting of over 100,000 parts work flawlessly to produce semiconductors in high volumes.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.",

A typical interceptor drone flies with four motor-powered propellers, but unlike the usual quadcopters, it is often shaped like a bullet or a rocket.\n\nInitially built to destroy high-flying reconnaissance craft, they've since been evolved by Ukrainians to take down long-range attack drones at a low cost — primarily as a response to Russia launching large waves of Iranian-designed Shaheds this year.\n\n\"These systems strengthen protection against drone terror while preserving resources for intercepting cruise and ballistic missiles,\" Ukraine's defense minister, Denys Shmyhal, said in Thursday's announcement.\n\nThe defense ministry also said it's been working with more than 10 interceptor manufacturers and has placed more orders for next year.\n\nFor Ukraine, interceptors must be fast enough to chase down drones such as the Shahed-136, which flies at a typical speed of 115 mph, while remaining cheap so that Kyiv's troops can sustainably use hundreds of them a day. Russia has recently been attacking with roughly 5,500 Shahed-type drones a month.\n\nSome Ukrainian drone makers have also been attempting to develop interceptors that can catch the Geran-3, the Russian version of the jet-powered Shahed-238, which can reportedly fly at an estimated 230 mph.\n\nUkraine's new production capacity comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in November that his country was producing roughly 600 to 800 interceptors a day, falling short of his initial goal.\n\nIn July, Zelenskyy had set a production target of 1,000 interceptors a day.\n\nUkraine's volunteer movements directly sponsor some interceptor drones for select military units, though their quantity is often limited compared to the scale of what the Ukrainian government provides.\n\nFor example, deliveries of the Wild Hornets' Sting, a $2,500 interceptor, were mostly sponsored this year by the Sternenko Foundation, a local crowdfunding organization.",

    "description": "Even as AI roles increase, mentions of the technology in job listings are down. It's a sign that bosses already expect you to use the technology.",
    "fullText": "That job description you're reading might not mention AI, but an employer will likely still expect you to know how to use it.\n\nA new snapshot of job listings from career platform Ladders showed that, while the number of AI roles listed on the site has tripled since 2021, the share of postings mentioning AI has decreased.\n\nIt's an indication that more employers are viewing technology as an everyday skill rather than as a differentiator, Marc Cenedella, founder and CEO of Ladders, told Business Insider.\n\n\"It will be mentioned less and less in the same way that Microsoft Office isn't mentioned in job postings anymore,\" he said.\n\nAmong about a dozen job categories Ladders reviewed, each saw a drop in postings that name-checked AI. For design and UX roles, AI mentions dropped from 56.7% of jobs in 2021 to 44.6% in 2025. Listings for product management positions registered a similar decrease.\n\nEven in software engineering, where the proliferation of coding agents has raised concerns that junior coders, in particular, will have a harder time finding work, AI references in job listings decreased from 53.5% to 45.8% in the four-year span.\n\nMentions of AI in job listings could pick up again, Cenedella said, if specialized tools emerge in different industries, though he said that might not happen until sometime in 2026 or 2027.\n\nIf that shift does come, it might mean that people in areas such as sales, pharmaceuticals, or semiconductors could need to demonstrate fluency with specific AI applications or methods for using the technology, Cenedella said. Employers could then start calling out those skills in job postings.\n\nThe overall drop in mentions of AI doesn't mean interest in the technology is fading, especially in certain areas. Ladders found that about 525,000 leadership and executive roles include AI references, up from 213,000 in 2021. All told, in 2025, the technology has been mentioned in 45% of executive postings on the site.\n\nRoles that aren't primarily technical — areas like finance, ops, design, sales, and project management — are seeing some of the fastest increases in AI skills adoption, Ladders found.\n\nOne reason, Cenedella said, is because the technology is moving so fast.\n\nOverall, Ladders said that jobs specifically about AI, such as engineering roles, shot up on its site to 6.7 million in 2025 from 2.1 million in 2021.\n\nRegardless of whether a job posting mentions AI, a boss will likely want you to be able to use it, Agur Jõgi, chief technology officer at the software company Pipedrive, told Business Insider.\n\n\"It's just like a ticket to the game,\" he said.\n\nJõgi said that you need to understand how AI is transforming your field and how it's affecting your job. \"That enables you to move as fast as the rest of the industry is moving,\" Jõgi said.\n\nJõgi said that if you're a holdout who's resisting using the technology, it could mean you're in for longer days if you want to keep up with colleagues who are going all in.\n\nEventually, as more people embrace AI, the early adopters who juiced their workplace productivity through AI will see that advantage fade, he said. To maintain it, Jõgi said, these go-getters will need to develop a fresh advantage.\n\n\"To beat the competition, you need to do something smarter, or you need to do slightly more,\" he said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "fullText": "Study author says tech companies are reaping benefits of artificial intelligence age but society is left to pay cost\n\nThe AI boom has caused as much carbon dioxide to be released into the atmosphere in 2025 as emitted by the whole of New York City, it has been claimed.\n\nThe global environmental impact of the rapidly spreading technology has been estimated in research published on Wednesday which also found that AI-related water use now exceeds the entirety of global bottled-water demand.\n\nThe figures have been compiled by the Dutch academic Alex de Vries-Gao, the founder of Digiconomist, a company that researches the unintended consequences of digital trends. He claimed they are the first attempt to measure the specific effect of artificial intelligence rather than datacentres in general as the use of chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini soared in 2025.\n\nThe figures show the estimated greenhouse gas emissions from AI use are also now equivalent to more than 8% of global aviation emissions. His study used technology companies’ own reporting and he called for stricter requirements for them to be more transparent about their climate impact.\n\n“The environmental cost of this is pretty huge in absolute terms,” he said. “At the moment society is paying for these costs, not the tech companies. The question is: is that fair? If they are reaping the benefits of this technology, why should they not be paying some of the costs?”\n\nDe Vries-Gao found that the 2025 carbon footprint of AI systems could be as high as 80m tonnes, while the water used could reach 765bn litres. He said it was the first time AI’s water impact had been estimated and showed that AI water use alone was more than a third higher than previous estimates of all datacentre water use.\n\nThe figures are published in the academic journal Patterns. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said earlier this year that AI-focused datacentres draw as much electricity as power-thirsty aluminium smelters and datacentre electricity consumption is expected to more than double by 2030.\n\n“This is yet more evidence that the public is footing the environmental bill for some of the richest companies on Earth,” said Donald Campbell, the director of advocacy at Foxglove, a UK non-profit that campaigns for fairness in tech. “Worse, it is likely just the tip of the iceberg. The datacentre construction frenzy, driven by generative AI, is only getting started.\n\n“Just one of these new ‘hyperscale’ facilities can generate climate emissions equivalent to several international airports. And in the UK alone, there are an estimated 100-200 of them in the planning system,” said Campbell.\n\nThe IEA has reported that the largest AI-focused datacentres being built today will each consume as much electricity as 2m households with the US accounting for the largest share of datacentre electricity consumption (45%) followed by China (25%) and Europe (15%).\n\nThe largest datacentre being planned in the UK, at a former coal power station site in Blyth, Northumberland, is expected to emit more than 180,000 tonnes of CO2 a year when at full operation – the equivalent to the amount produced by more than 24,000 homes.\n\nIn India, where $30bn (£22.5bn) is being invested in datacentres, there are growing concerns that a lack of reliability from the National Grid will mean the construction of huge diesel generator farms for backup power, which the consultancy KPMG this week called “a massive … carbon liability”.\n\nTechnology companies’ environmental disclosures are often insufficient to assess even the total datacentre impact, never mind isolating AI use, said De Vries-Gao. He noted that when Google recently reported on the impact of its Gemini AI, it did not account for the water used in generating the electricity needed to power it.\n\nGoogle reported that in 2024 it managed to reduce energy emissions from its datacentres by 12% due to new clean energy sources, but it said this summer that achieving its climate goals was “now more complex and challenging across every level – from local to global” and “a key challenge is the slower-than-needed deployment of carbon-free energy technologies at scale”.\n\nGoogle was approached for comment.",

    "description": "Smith was judged to have been caught behind despite the technology not matching up again",
    "fullText": "Jamie Smith was at the centre of the latest controversy with Snicko technology during a tense day of Test cricket at the Adelaide Oval.\n\nSmith looked to hook a short ball from Pat Cummins and seemingly missed the ball which flew through to Alex Carey behind the stumps.\n\nCarey, Cummins and co. all appealed believing Smith to have made contact with the ball but the England batter was ready to review the umpire’s decision.\n\nBut, the umpire decided to send for a review to see if the ball had cleanly landed in Carey’s hands before making a decision on the field. As part of that process a replay of the incident was shown with Snicko showing a spike after the ball had passed Smith’s bat. At the same time there seemed to be a gap between the bat and ball but the third umpire ruled that Smith had hit the ball and was out.\n\nEngland captain Ben Stokes, who was batting at the time, dropped his head in disbelief when the decision was shown on the big screen. Smith’s dismissal left England 159-6 and over 200 runs behind Australia’s first innings total of 371.\n\nThe controversy was just one of several incidents on day two in which the technology process was questioned. Earlier examples saw Smith glove the ball to Usman Khawaja at second slip and Joe Root get an inside edge through to Carey. In both instances the ball bounced before reaching the respective fielders.\n\nOn Test Match Special, Alex Hartley labelled the controversies as ‘ridiculous’ and claimed that the Snicko technology needed ‘sacking’.\n\nShe said: “It is going to boot off here. This is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. This is where Snicko needs sacking.\n\n“The third umpire said there is nothing obvious there as he could see a gap between the bat and ball. Jamie Smith is convinced he didn't hit it. Australia have gone up and made a loud noise because everybody knows you don't trust Snicko now, so you appeal for everything and review it if you have to.\n\n“Ben Stokes has his hands on his hips. Smith has gone off shaking his head.”\n\nHer view was echoed by former England players Greame Swann and Steven Finn on TNT Sports who both called out the inaccuracies in the technology and for it to be removed.\n\n“It just doesn’t make sense,” said Swann, “Cricket makes itself open to ridicule sometimes.”\n\nThe incident follows yesterday’s controversy over Alex Carey’s DRS review which resulted in him being given not out on 72 despite hitting the ball.",

    "description": "The new Spanx jeans feature cleverly hidden modern sculpting technology. The denim feels luxe, while the compressive panels reshape my hips and waist.",
    "fullText": "At nine months postpartum, I've been focused on revamping my wardrobe with comfortable outfits that still feel chic. My body has changed in ways I didn't expect, and so has the fit of my clothes — but I've finally found jeans that have helped me embrace my shape.\n\nI didn't expect it, but Spanx's denim is the answer. The jeans use the brand's namesake compression technology to create a stretchy, sculpting fit that moves with me but doesn't feel restrictive or look like jeggings. I tried five pairs to see which ones felt most worth it, and in the end, the SPANXshape Authentic 360 Wide Leg Jeans ($158) came out on top. The washed black color I have looks expensive and chic, and the wide legs offer just enough wiggle room. And, magically, they also seem to snatch my waist as soon as I zip them up.\n\nBefore I go into more detail, I'll just say one thing: All bodies are beautiful just the way they are, and no tummy needs to be \"tamed\" in order to look cute in jeans. But if you're in the market for jeans that have some shaping qualities, here's everything to know about shopping for Spanx denim.\n\nReDefine: The most rigid of the three, this denim type is meant to sculpt the tummy, thighs, and bum for a smoother, more lifted appearance. The jeans come with functional pockets, zippers, and buttons, so despite their technical fabric, they still look like jeans. Size options range from 0 to 26, with petite and tall options.\n\nAuthentic 360: This style features a four-way stretch with medium compression and a panel that shapes the belly, waist, and backside. \"They provide a more classic denim experience in a more structured premium fabric that smooths,\" says Pascale Gueracague, the Chief Design Officer at Spanx. This collection has sizes ranging from XS to 3X with petite and tall options.\n\nEveryWear: This is the most relaxed, stretchy denim of the three. \"The newly upgraded EveryWear jeans are a pull-on style with 'TummyTamer Tech,' faux hardware, and a smooth waistband,\" says Gueracague. While the back pockets are functioning, they're missing front pockets and a fly zipper. Its sizes range from XS to 3X, with petite and tall options.\n\nThey snatch my waist and smooth my belly. I'm not going to lie: it was difficult to zip them up because they are pretty compressive in the belly area, and the fabric is somewhat thick and stiff. But these factors worked to flatten my lower belly and cinch my waist.\n\nHonestly? I feel really, really good about how my body looks in the Spanx Authentic 360 Wide Leg, especially being postpartum. The amount of shimmying it took to get into this pair made me doubt myself, but as soon as I turned around and saw my reflection, I had an instant boost of confidence.\n\nThey look and feel like expensive jeans. I'm usually skeptical of jeans that come in alpha sizing (XS-3X) — they tend to lack the quality and precise fit of jeans that come in numeric sizing. But Spanx as a whole has surprised me with just how high-end the jeans look and feel, all while remaining size-inclusive. You get functioning pockets all around, real hardware buttons and zippers, and a clean, chic finish that is unmistakably denim. They even come in a trendy barrel-leg design.\n\nI also love that these wide-leg jeans are made without any branding or stitching on the back pockets — because even though I'm obsessed with its jeans, I don't necessarily want the world to know that I'm wearing Spanx.\n\nThey don't feel great to sit in for long. With so much compression in the belly area, they may be uncomfortable if you're going on a long car ride or you're in a deep squat. You can always size up to make them more comfortable, but you may lose some of the shaping benefits in the process.\n\nIf I had to pick a favorite between the two pairs of Authentic 360 jeans I tested, it would be these. The 90s Straight Leg cut was a win, and while the compression did feel similar to the black wide-leg pair, for some reason, they felt slightly easier to button up. I suspect there could be a slight discrepancy between the different washes.\n\nWhile I did cuff them, the petite inseam length was the perfect length for my shorter frame. I found them easier to put on and supportive while walking around, but they weren't very comfortable when I was seated for long periods of time.\n\nMy tummy looks quite flat in these, but then again, so does my bum. I wish the fabric were a bit thinner in the seat area, or maybe even that they had a different panel just below the booty for an added lift. The compression level ultimately stifled the natural curves of my body.\n\nI can be picky about the color of my blue jeans, but the Elysian wash is the perfect mid-tone hue. It's not too dark and not too light, with a color that looks dimensional and not just a single wash of blue — ultimately, making the jeans look more expensive and high-quality.\n\nIn comparison to the Authentic 360 jeans, the EveryWear fabric feels a lot smoother, a bit thinner (yet still feels well-made and like real denim), and much, much stretchier. These are made for casual days: I could sit in them for hours without getting those painful red indentations on my skin.\n\nThey're not as sculpting as the other pairs. I felt my lower belly looked slightly smoothed and flattened, but I didn't get the same waist-snatching effect. The EveryWear jeans definitely put comfort at the forefront.\n\nI had to jump to get them on— but as soon as they were, they fit like a glove. No, seriously. It took some real effort to get these jeans over my bum, but I was justly rewarded. They never felt too snug or tight in any area, so they allowed my curves some room. Namely, my booty looked a little less flattened than it did in Authentic 360 jeans. \n\nI wish they had real pockets and zippers. I understand how removing pockets and limiting layers of fabric makes for a smoother appearance, but as a new mom, I could always use extra pocket space.\n\nThat said, these jeans are the most comfortable of the bunch, with ultra-soft fabric that feels like a second skin. The fabric has an incredible amount of stretch, so I could actually breathe in them all day. I'm not usually a fan of pull-on jeans — in most cases, I'd rather just wear leggings — but I could make an exception for this pair. And honestly, you can't really tell that the front is an illusion like many other similar high-waisted jeans, because there is a real fly button and raised seams that look legit.\n\nThey have the strongest level of compression out of all three Spanx denim fabrics. The ReDefine collection is the newest denim release from Spanx, and the jeans feature real hardware and pockets — which is a major bonus for my taste. I also like that the lack of excess material around the legs means I can tuck them into knee-high boots.\n\nThis sculpting denim takes it up a notch with \"strong compression,\" while the Authentic 360 and EveryWear denim are only medium compression. There's definitely some stretch to these jeans, but they do feel pretty tight and rigid by comparison — especially around the belly and bum. Ultimately, they weren't very comfortable to sit in.\n\nMore than the other styles, I found that the ReDefine range runs small. My typical size postpartum has been a 10 or 12. I tried this pair in a 12, and really struggled to put them on. I could have gone up a full size, or even two. My biggest piece of advice with the ReDefine line is to know your measurements, and when in doubt, go with the bigger size.\n\nThat said, this fabrication seems to have the best of both worlds. It looks and feels like real denim, bearing similar traits to my preferred Authentic 360 jeans (albeit much more compressive and tight around the belly). They do have a bit more stretch thanks to the Lycra, which is most akin to the EveryWear styles. Overall, if I had sized up, these could've been my favorite fit of them all. But in reality, the strong compression feels a bit too intense for my day-to-day.\n\nThis was my least favorite pair I tried. I first thought the ankle length would set them apart in a good way, but they just didn't look right on my frame. They're fabricated with Spanx Authentic 360 denim, which is a blend of cotton, polyester, and just 1% elastane, meaning they're not very stretchy.\n\nI disliked the cropped cut and patch pockets. This is, of course, a personal preference, but I do feel like the shorter cut \"shrinks\" me — and I'm already five feet flat. I prefer the full-length Wide Leg and 90s Straight styles instead because they make my legs look longer. My issue with the pockets is more personal — I feel like they draw the eye to my lower belly, and I'm more conscious of that area postpartum.\n\nThe denim is highly compressive, so it's best for active days. It definitely feels a bit tight, especially around my belly. This tightness isn't necessarily uncomfortable, but I feel it if I'm sitting down for too long. I didn't mind it when I was walking around and taking care of my baby on the go — in fact, I appreciated the support in those moments.\n\nSpanx jeans are a little high-maintenance. You can't just throw them in the regular laundry pile, because the dryer will wreck their elasticity. \"We recommend turning denim inside out, machine washing cold on a gentle cycle, and laying flat or hanging to dry\" explains Gueracague. \"High heat can break down stretch fibers, so it's best to avoid the dryer whenever possible, and there's no need for steaming, ironing, or dry cleaning.\"\n\nI also found that some pairs — like the intense compression in the ReDefine and Authentic 360 jeans — felt a bit too tight around the waistband in some situations (for sit-down brunches and car rides, I had to unbutton the top to allow myself some breathing room). \n\nThe EveryWear denim is much more comfortable when sitting down, but the pull-on style and faux pockets could be a turn-off for some.\n\nAll in all, I'm pretty impressed with Spanx's shaping denim. I'd say the most comfortable pair for casual wear is the EveryWear Wide Leg Jeans. But if I want that instant hourglass effect, I'll definitely be reaching for my Authentic 360 Wide Leg Jeans.\n\nSpanx jeans are a moderate splurge at $138-$168 a pair, and the sizing can be tricky. They also require more special care than cotton denim. That said, they truly are high-quality jeans that'll create silhouettes you didn't know you had in you.\n\nThere are very few denim brands I actually like on my petite, curvy figure, but Spanx happens to be one of them. They're more expensive than the cult-favorite Abercrombie jeans (about $90 per pair), yet cost less than the equally adored, yet higher-end, Mother Denim (about $258 per pair).\n\nAs our editors found with its Perfect Black Work Pants, Spanx clothing is consistently high quality, and you don't have to wear any shapewear undergarments with them. Plus, the clean branding allows you to wear them in casual settings or at the office.\n\nThey do, however, take special care to maintain. I let each pair of jeans I tested air dry (as suggested in the care instructions) so I didn't have to worry about them shrinking. They kept their compression qualities even after I washed them a handful of times, and since they proved their durability, I can tell that they'll be a staple in my wardrobe for a long time (as long as I keep taking good care of them).\n\nThe ReDefine jeans definitely run small, so I suggest measuring yourself and rounding up a size if you're unsure.\n\nThe rest are pretty true to size, though the compression creates a tighter feel, so you may want to size up anyway. I'm only five feet tall, and the petite 30-inch inseam worked best for me. The inseam lengths can vary by style, so check the size guide before you place your order.

    "fullText": "Keir Starmer’s office claims UK still in ‘active conversations’ about deal for tech industries in both countries to cooperate\n\nDowning Street insists the $40bn Tech Prosperity Deal between the US and UK that is on hold is not permanently stalled. The BBC reported on Tuesday evening that the prime minister’s office claimed that the UK remains in “active conversations with US counterparts at all levels of government” about the wide-ranging deal for the technology industries in both countries to cooperate.\n\nThe agreement, previously billed as historic, was paused after the US accused the UK of failing to lower trade barriers, including a digital services tax on US tech companies and food safety rules that limit the export of some agricultural products. The New York Times first reported British confirmation that negotiations had stalled.\n\n“We look forward to resuming work on this partnership as quickly as possible,” a Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement. She added that the UK government is committed to ensuring a “bond” with the US “and working together to help shape the emerging technologies of the future”.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTuesday’s developments come as relations between the US and the EU are likewise chilling. The Trump administration threatened European tech firms on Tuesday with economic penalties if the EU refused to roll back what it called “discriminatory actions”. The Office of the US Trade Representative accused the EU and some member states of “discriminatory and harassing lawsuits, taxes, fines and directives against U.S. services”.\n\nThe Trade Representative’s office said in a post on Twitter/X that these companies could face fees and restrictions on foreign services. The bureau singled out European companies, including Accenture, DHL, Spotify and Siemens as being able to “operate freely in the United States for decades, benefitting from access to our market and consumers on a level playing field.\n\n“If the E.U. and E.U. Member States insist on continuing to restrict, limit, and deter the competitiveness of U.S. service providers through discriminatory means, the United States will have no choice but to begin using every tool at its disposal to counter these unreasonable measures,” the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said on X.\n\nThomas Regnier, a spokesperson for the European Commission, responded by stressing that their rules “apply equally and fairly to all companies” operating in the region, according to the New York Times. “We will continue to enforce our rules fairly, and without discrimination,” he said.\n\nThe retaliation by the US follows a $140m fine slapped on Elon Musk’s X social media platform for violating transparency rules under the Digital Services Act. EU regulators took issue with the “deceptive design of X’s ‘blue checkmark’,” “lack of transparency of X’s ads repository” and “failure to provide researchers access to public data”. The EU has proven much more willing than the US to regulate, investigate and penalize tech giants, a point of contention with the Trump administration.",

    "fullText": "The US government is launching an early career hiring and talent development program to bring more technology and artificial intelligence employees to the public sector, as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to modernize government systems and stay ahead in the global tech race.\n\nThe launch of the “US Tech Force” is designed to address a technical and early career talent gap across the government, according to Scott Kupor, the director of the Office of Personnel Management which is spearheading the program. The effort comes amid a broader war for AI talent, with tech companies offering sizable salaries and other perks to attract top engineers and researchers.\n\nOPM plans to hire an initial cohort of 1,000 early career software engineers, data scientists, project managers and AI experts to be placed across government agencies for the two-year program. It will also partner with tech companies to recommend early career managers to take a leave of absence from their private-sector roles to join the Tech Force.\n\n“If you’re thinking about, long term, a career in technology, there is no bigger and more complex set of problems than we face in the federal government,” Kupor said in a call with reporters ahead of the program’s announcement Monday.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to implement AI to modernize and make more efficient systems across the federal government, including with the controversial Department of Government Efficiency. That effort, launched under Elon Musk earlier this year, is no longer operating as a “centralized” organization, officials said last month.\n\nPresident Donald Trump in July also signed an AI action plan, a set of initiatives and policy recommendations that centered on growing US AI infrastructure and scaling back regulation to promote US competitiveness.\n\nMembers of the new US Tech Force will work directly for individual agencies on projects determined by agency leadership. OPM will conduct an initial review and technical assessment of applicants and recommend approved candidates to agencies for final interviews and hiring decisions.\n\nApplications open Monday, and OPM hopes to have most members of the first cohort placed in roles within the first quarter of 2026.\n\nMembers of the Tech Force are expected to work on projects such as incorporating advanced AI into drones and other weapons at the Department of Defense, building out the Trump Accounts platform at the Internal Revenue Service, and using AI to improve intelligence at the State Department, among other initiatives, according to Kupor.\n\nThroughout the two-year program, OPM plans to bring in Silicon Valley CEOs and other executives for speaker events. It will also partner with around 25 tech companies to provide mentorship and career planning advice to members of the cohort. Microsoft, Adobe, Amazon, Meta and xAI are among the companies that have signed on as partners of the program.\n\nThe program will conclude with a job fair, where program members will have access to both public- and private-sector opportunities. Salaries for members of the Tech Force are expected to range from approximately $130,000 to $195,000.\n\n“There is an incredible race for talent in these areas … so part of what we want to do is be competitive on compensation,” Kupor said. He added that he wanted potential applicants to “understand that in doing this, they’re going to learn a bunch, they’re going to tackle really complex problems, and then they can ultimately go back to the private sector, if that’s what they want to do, and certainly will have the opportunity to maximize their financial opportunity as a result.”",

Hyundai and Kia must also outfit all future vehicles sold in the U.S. with a key piece of technology called an engine immobilizer and pay up to $4.5 million of restitution to people whose vehicles were damaged by thieves.\n\nThe settlement was reached by 35 states, including California, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. The vehicles eligible for fixes date as far back as 2011 and as recently as 2022. About 9 million eligible vehicles were sold nationwide.\n\nThefts of Hyundai and Kia vehicles soared in part because beginning in 2021, videos posted to TikTok and other social media demonstrated how someone could steal a car with just a screwdriver and a USB cable. Minneapolis reported an 836% increase in Hyundai and Kia thefts from 2021 to 2022. Ellison announced an investigation into the automakers in early 2023.\n\nEllison said the two companies installed engine immobilizers on cars sold in Mexico and Canada, but not widely in the U.S., leading to car thefts, crimes and crashes that injured and even killed people, including teenagers.\n\n“This crisis that we're talking about today started in a boardroom, traveled through the internet and ended up in tragic results when somebody stole those cars,” Ellison said at a news conference.\n\nHe was joined by Twin Cities officials, a woman whose mother was killed when a stolen Kia crashed into her parents’ vehicle and a man whose car was stolen nine times — as recently as Monday night, and including seven times after a previous software fix.\n\nUnder the settlement, Hyundai and Kia will install a zinc sleeve to stop would-be thieves from cracking open a vehicle's ignition cylinder and starting the car.\n\nEligible customers will have one year from the date of the companies' notice to get the repair at an authorized dealership. The repairs are expected to be available from early 2026 through early 2027.\n\nIn separate statements, the automakers said the agreement is one of multiple anti-theft efforts they have taken to help customers.\n\n“Kia is eager to continue working with law enforcement officers and officials at federal, state, and local levels to combat criminal car theft, and the role social media has played in encouraging it, and we remain fully committed to upholding vehicle security,” the company said.\n\nHyundai said, “We will continue to take meaningful action to support our customers and ensure peace of mind.”\n\nDura reported from Bismarck, North Dakota.",

The analysts noted that the firm's broader forecast also incorporates easing tariff pressures.\n\nIn line with that view, the analysts said that they expect earnings per share of real estate companies to rise from 5% this year to 15% next year, while those in consumer discretionary are expected to increase from 3% to 7%.\n\nIndustrial companies are also set for a major rebound, with EPS growth forecast to accelerate from 4% to 15%.\n\nSigns of this shift are already showing up in market action.\n\nIn a separate Friday report, Goldman noted that cyclical stocks have surged, beating defensive names for 14 trading days through Thursday — the longest streak in more than 15 years.\n\nEven so, Goldman analysts say the recent outperformance still isn't enough to reflect the firm's more optimistic growth outlook. Market positioning within equities suggests investors expect growth closer to 2% — well below Goldman's 2.5% forecast.\n\n\"Despite the cyclical rebound and widespread economic optimism in our client conversations, the market does not appear to be fully pricing the likely economic acceleration in 2026,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nThat acceleration is central to Goldman's view.

    "title": "From trees to graphs: speeding up vector search 10x with Hannoy",
    "description": "This is a walkthrough of a new LMDB-based HNSW Rust vector store with drastically better performances than the previous random-projection-based one. This is a disk-based HNSW highly vector store inspired by the DiskANN technology and is now used by default in Meilisearch.",
    "fullText": "This article aims to address several limitations of the current vector database used by Meilisearch, and to introduce hannoy: a graph-based alternative to arroy using LMDB, which is already part of Meilisearch since v1.21 (Sept 15) as experimental and the default one since v1.29 (Dec 8).\n\nEarly testing has shown that the new system can reduce indexing times from 2 days to 2 hours, decrease the on-disk index size by a factor of 2, and speed up search by ~10 times. When it was first put into production on an instance with indexing difficulties, it reduced the indexing latency from 2 months to... 6 seconds.\n\nTo illustrate why this is the case, I'll run through some key heuristics of graph ANN algorithms and share a few snippets from the code that are particularly illustrative. Finally, we'll share some benchmarks comparing the new solution to what's currently in Meilisearch today.\n\nI am not a Meilisearch employee or affiliated with the company in any way other than being a co-author on their new vector database.\n\nI first became aware of Meilisearch back in March, when my company began considering their enterprise solution for hosting and indexing our collection of ~10 million documents. As any sane person would do, I stalked their GitHub and was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of in-house crates they maintained and used in their search engine. Amongst them was arroy: a k-d trees inspired vector database, based initially on Spotify's similarly named project: annoy.\n\nWasting no time, I made my first open source contribution ever to the repo and... welp, it's still not merged 😔. But hey, as the French say: that's life.\n\nFortunately, I was still able to merge a few other PR's in the meantime and learn more about how the algorithm worked. The back and forth I had with other devs throughout the process (notably with @irevoire) was instructive and overall made it a pretty enjoyable experience.\n\nAfter a couple of months of working on arroy, I naturally became aware of a few unsavoury trade-offs that lurked beneath the surface, and which ultimately motivated me to pursue a new approach.\n\nArroy is a k-d tree-based ANN algorithm, meaning that during indexing, you construct an ensemble of random partitions of your vector space, and at runtime, you search through them all simultaneously. To be more precise, it's random-projection-based.\n\nVisually, that process looks like the pic below:\n\nA widespread criticism of this type of approach is that search performance and latency degrade when the dimension of the embeddings exceeds about 20. Let's try to understand why.\n\nLooking at the code, we see that leaf nodes store as many vectors as the embedding dimension. This is a good and bad thing. In the extreme case where \"one leaf equals one vector\", e.g., you have a binary tree, each tree has height log2(n). By grouping d-many vectors in a leaf, trees can be built much faster since they only have height log2(n/d). For 1 million vectors of dimension 768, the numbers work out to building trees with heights of 10 versus 20; that's a 2.6 MiB versus 1.9 GiB in storage overhead for a single tree. This makes arroy B-tree-like, which is cool.\n\nWhere this is problematic, however, is at search time since you need to compare the query to each vector in a leaf. Even if you're only trying to retrieve the 10 nearest-neighbours, you still need to do 768 distance calculations 😔. That adds significant latency during retrieval.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no \"nice\" compromise; if you make leaves more granular, you need to store more nodes in the tree, which increases the index size in memory and exponentially increases build times, as we've seen.\n\nWhen using binary vectors and a bit-sampling hash, the memory overhead is just a single usize per node indicating the position of the random bit. This is the only case where we can afford to generate deeper trees, as storing a node on disk incurs next to no cost.\n\nAnother big problem with arroy is that the indexing algorithm is extremely read-heavy. That makes sense given that to create a hyperplane, you need to randomly sample points from the current node to generate clusters. The impact of this is so high that in some builds, over 90% of the time is spent doing IO and in page faults - a problem that only grows exponentially with dataset size. This phenomenon is still unresolved, as documented in arroy#145.\n\nOperational concerns aside, it's also just difficult to maintain arroy. There's a lot of mental gymnastics involved in understanding the recursive tree balancing algorithms, the creation and merging of temp files during partial builds, and the heuristics for auto-selecting build parameters. But hey, maybe that's a skill issue on my part.\n\nCurrent state-of-the-art ANN libraries employ graph-based approaches to achieve the optimal trade-off between search time and recall performance. Here, a navigable graph is built over all points in the database, and search is performed using a best-first traversal in log time. So rather than imposing structure on the dataset via separating hyperplanes like in arroy, techniques like HNSW and DiskANN focus more on building up pathways between points in local neighbourhoods.\n\nIf you haven't already read it, I'd recommend Pinecone's fantastic blog post on Faiss and the hnsw to get a working mental model of how these algorithms work. For the academically inclined, the original paper is also quite insightful.\n\nFor the search to converge quickly to the (approximate) nearest neighbour, the graph needs to satisfy what's known as the sparse neighbourhood graph (SNG) property. Put simply, points in a local neighbourhood of x should be closer to x than they are to each other. For the mathematically inclined, this property reduces to the relations below :\n\nThis equation is the \"secret sauce,\" if you will, of graph ANNs. Both the HNSW, DiskANN, and hannoy! rely on this to ensure efficient search.\n\nVector search over a graph has several advantages over space-partitioning approaches. First of all, it's extremely cheap to store node edges on disk at around ~200 bytes per vector even without using compressed bitmaps (which we do). For another, disk reads and distance computations at search time are significantly reduced as neighbours are explored one at a time instead of in large chunks. Insertions and deletions are also much simpler using a graph, as we only need to update the incoming/outgoing links from the modified nodes. In contrast, in arroy these operations potentially trigger tree re-balancing right up to the root.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, arroy is still great in the sense that it's disk-based, being built on top of LMDB. This means that you can build and search through indexes that are much larger than your machine's RAM using mmap. For reference, many popular HNSW implementations operate entirely in RAM, which is fast but requires multiple nodes and partitioning if the dataset becomes too large. So arroy was pretty avant-garde in that respect.\n\nHannoy is a graph-based successor to arroy with KV-backed storage via LMDB.\n\nThe goal of hannoy is to combine the best of both worlds from arroy and graph ANNs into a production-ready vector database that maintains and improves upon key metrics vs the legacy system. What's also neat is that it makes heavy use of crates maintained by the Meilisearch devs, such as heed, roaring-rs, and steppe.\n\nIts implementation is inspired by a few projects, notably Faiss' HNSW and the hnsw crate, but with significantly more support for zero-copy semantics, persistence, SIMD, and online updates & multi-phase indexing. There are also several novel techniques inspired by research papers to handle tasks such as graph merges and layer exploration.\n\nThe most interesting engineering challenge of the project was determining how to handle incremental insertions and deletions to the graph over its lifetime. After all, we expect users' databases to grow over time, and not all their data is available immediately. The industry standard for graph algorithms had been to periodically rebuild the index either on a cron-like schedule or after sufficient updates had accumulated. The FreshDiskANN paper summarizes this issue with this type of approach succinctly:\n\nIt would take about 1.5-2 hours on a dedicated high-end 48-core machine to build a good-quality HNSW index over 100M points. So we would need three dedicated machines for constantly rebuilding indices to maintain even six-hourly freshness guarantee over a billion point index. [1]\n\nLuckily for us, Microsoft has already solved this problem. The idea essentially boils down to avoiding eager updates to the graph by orchestrating a streaming delete/insert/merge operation once the size of a particular in-memory temporary index reaches a critical size. While this is certainly a proven strategy, with hannoy we aimed to implement something a bit less complicated, but which still makes liberal use of techniques from DiskANN (even though technically hannoy is an HNSW).\n\nWhen items are added or deleted from the graph, a special Updated key is written to the database pointing to the modified node. Before building the index, we generate a bitset of items that are (i) new, (ii) modified, or (iii) removed & pass those to the HnswBuilder. The deletion bitset plays a special role at the end of the build where instead of just removing any edge $(e,d)$ between an existing and deleted item, we explore the neighbourhood of $d$ to patch the links of $e$ à la DiskANN. This prevents \"gaps\" from appearing in the graph and ensures search still converges quickly (recall that SNG property from earlier 😉).\n\nThe code below shows how we accomplish this in hannoy:\n\nAnother interesting feature of hannoy is how the new graph (in RAM) is merged with the old one (from disk, in LMDB). For each batch of points to be inserted, we build a brand new HNSW in RAM. To ensure that this new graph connects to the old one, we reschedule the entry points of the old graph for re-indexing in the new one. Every time we need to access an item's links, we look in both memory and LMDB. This way, we can establish connections with the larger disk-based index in a lazy manner. This is essential, as otherwise, any new vectors inserted into the database after the initial build would be unreachable; you'd only be able to search in disjoint graphs, and recall would suffer.\n\nThis strategy actually works well in practice ! By re-indexing <<1% of the vectors in the original graph, we're able to merge on-disk and in-memory indexes seamlessly. To the best of my knowledge, this is a novel technique that no other HNSW implementations utilize for handling incremental builds, and it is essential to the use case at Meilisearch, where batch insertions are heavily used.\n\nThere are tons of other cool sub-problems like those that we address in hannoy, but I'll save those for another post. The important part to retain here is that hannoy is \"a DiskANN-inspired HNSW implementation with LMDB-backed storage\".\n\nI like making unsubstantiated claims about the performance of my system as much as the next guy, but there comes a point when it's time to share some hard numbers. That time is now!\n\nTo facilitate comparison between the old system and the new one, we'll utilize the trusty vector-store-relevancy-benchmark from Meilisearch, as featured in previous blog posts. The important metrics we'll be comparing are recall (1, 10, 50, 100), indexing time, retrieval latency, and disk usage for various datasets with differing embedding dimensions. To simplify the process, we'll run the benchmark on 1 million documents using cosine as the indexing/retrieval distance metric in full precision. We'll also run the benchmark using each database's preferred quantization format.\n\nWhen quantization is enabled, arroy by default uses the cosine distance over the [0,1]-valued vectors. In hannoy, we've noticed that the hamming distance between binary strings (x^y) is vastly more performant in both speed and recall. Intuitively, the speed part makes sense as the distance computation reduces to popcnt's !\n\nThe results I'll be sharing are cherry-picked from the much more complete benchmarking summary in hannoy.\n\nNote that the reported search latency numbers represent the cold-start times. In reality, search times will speed up as more of the database is loaded into the page cache. From the flamegraph below, we can see that ~25% of our time is spent on mdb_get calls, so running a few warmup queries could significantly reduce retrieval times.\n\nAs you can see from these numbers, hannoy certainly improves upon all of the metrics we discussed - and by quite a large margin. In some cases, indexing times drop by nearly 10x, while the same amount improves search latencies.\n\nHaving a bit of free time on my hands, I thought I'd tackle writing the Python bindings for hannoy using pyo3. With these in place, it becomes much easier to integrate the project with the renowned ANN Benchmarks leaderboard.\n\nWhat's cool here is that even with the log(n) lookups from LMDB and potential page faults in our mmap, we're still beating in-memory annoy (arroy but in C) and competitive enough with Faiss' implementation. This graph indicates that we still have some work to do in terms of performance. Still, considering it was an initial implementation thrown together fairly quickly, it's certainly a good start. The most essential things for hannoy are ensuring that we keep the same API as arroy to facilitate integration in Meilisearch, and of course, that it improves on the metrics with respect to the previous system.\n\nI covered a lot of ground in this blog post, but still haven't answered the essential question \"Why the HNSW and not DiskANN?\" - and to be honest, I still don't have a satisfactory answer.\n\nOn one hand, the HNSW seemed the easiest out of the two to implement, given our constraint of using LMDB as a storage backend (DiskANN has a lot of async IO going on to maximize throughput on SSD reads, which aren't as straightforward to implement using mmap). From another perspective, HNSW is the gateway to graph ANNs and seemed like a good first approach to try out, validating whether this was a valid alternative to Meilisearch's prevailing vector database. If convincing results could be obtained with relatively little effort, it was certainly worth trying out. That being said, DiskANN and FreshDiskANN certainly influenced many of my design choices throughout, and I'm sure the project will evolve to resemble them more closely.\n\nI published this article everywhere on the internet, and if you want to comment, please take a look at Lobste.rs, Hackernews, Reddit, Twitter, Bsky or even post a comment in here 👇",

    "fullText": "Dark mode has emerged as one of the most significant accessibility considerations in digital design, yet it is still often treated as a nice-to-have rather than a fundamental feature. Many organisations adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure accessibility compliance, but compliance does not always equate to usability.\n\nFor blind and low-vision users, as well as some neurodivergent individuals, dark mode is not just a preference—it is a necessity. It reduces glare, enhances contrast, and extends the time users can comfortably engage with digital content. Without it, users experience fatigue, headaches, and even an inability to complete tasks, ultimately leading to frustration, abandonment, and exclusion from digital services.\n\nWhen we speak directly to users with lived experience, the importance of dark mode becomes even clearer.\n\nDaniel describes why his phone is permanently set to dark mode:\n\n“My phone's permanently set on a dark mode to reduce the glare of any of the white screens or anything just blasting me in the eyes. It helps me use screens for longer so my eyes don't get as fatigued at the end of the day. Even people who have lost 99% of their vision still have a light sensitivity.”\n\nThis statement challenges a common misconception about blindness—many blind individuals still have some residual vision, and light sensitivity remains a significant issue. For them, bright screens are not just inconvenient; they are painful and actively reduce their ability to engage in digital work and communication.\n\nDan emphasises the connection between screen brightness and headaches and fatigue:\n“When you have this bright light just blasting you in the eyes, it's painful, it gives you headaches. Most of your job you're doing these days, you're looking at a computer screen. There are very few jobs where you're not looking at a computer screen. So if you want to extend how long you're able to do that work for, you need to try and get the most favourable conditions for your eyes.”\n\nThis highlights the occupational accessibility barriers that bright screens create. Digital tools should empower people to work efficiently, not force them into discomfort and early fatigue.\nAnother challenge with bright white backgrounds is the way it affects readability:\n“A bright white background is an issue because it causes bleeding into the other colours. So if you have thin black writing on a white background, the white's so bright that it kind of makes it hard to look at the black writing.”\n\nThis phenomenon, known as halation, makes text appear blurred or distorted for many users, reducing legibility and comprehension. Conversely, dark backgrounds with white text provide greater clarity. Patrick, who has a degenerative eye condition explains:\n“White text on a black background doesn't just look cool, it's much easier on the eyes. When I used white on black, it was easier because the print would stand out much more. Even looking at the time was much easier. The numbers would just jump at you.”\n\nFor users with low vision, neurodivergent conditions like dyslexia, and even those experiencing age-related vision decline, dark mode significantly improves readability and usability.\n\nDespite dark mode's widespread popularity, there is surprisingly little formal research or quantitative data on its accessibility benefits. However, after aggregating insights across multiple See Me Please user testing projects—each involving 18 diverse participants, including 3 blind, 3 with low vision, 3 neurodivergent, 3 Deaf or Hard of Hearing, 3 over 70, and 3 with limited English proficiency—we were struck by how often dark mode emerged as the most requested feature. It was consistently the top accessibility request across companies, often ranking higher than other common accessibility improvements. Based on our experience, we estimate that around 75% of our low vision testers and at least half of our blind testers express a strong preference or need for dark mode.\n\nThis aligns with broader user preferences, as many others—including neurodivergent users and those sensitive to screen brightness—also value dark mode for comfort and usability. While accessibility standards often overlook dark mode, our findings suggest it is a critical feature that enhances real-world usability for a wide range of users.\n\nDesign and development teams only have so much capacity, and when considering investments in accessibility, it's crucial to prioritise features that deliver the greatest impact for users. Our user testing strongly suggests that dark mode is not just a preference but a necessity, resonating far more than the collective value placed on embedded read-aloud features, which are often included on websites but rarely requested by people with a disability with the same urgency. If organisations are weighing accessibility investments, particularly in enterprise settings, thinking about how dark mode can be integrated—at least in new applications—could provide far greater usability benefits than other commonly implemented accessibility features\n\nWCAG provides an essential foundation for digital accessibility, yet it does not specifically require dark mode support. While it recommends sufficient contrast (WCAG 2.1, Success Criterion 1.4.3), the standard does not ensure that interfaces are comfortable for all users.\nStudies on dark mode’s impact show that:\n\nDespite these benefits, many organisations assume meeting WCAG contrast requirements is enough. However, true accessibility is about usability, not just compliance. If a user is technically able to read content but experiences discomfort, pain, or excessive strain, that content is not truly accessible.\n\nWithout dark mode, users often face severe consequences:\n\nFor businesses and government agencies, failing to offer dark mode creates barriers to service access, particularly for those who rely on assistive technologies.\n\nMany users rely on plug-ins and third-party tools like Dark Reader, Midnight Lizard, and Stylus to force dark mode on websites that don’t natively support it. While these tools provide short-term solutions, they are essentially overlays, which introduce several accessibility issues.\n\nOverlays modify the display at the browser level, rather than adjusting the UI in a way that is intended, tested, or optimised by the original developers. This can cause:\n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions about overlays is that they solve accessibility problems. In reality, they often introduce new barriers rather than removing them.\n\nThe key difference between pushing colour inversion with a plug-in versus native dark mode comes down to control and consistency. Colour inversion, when applied through a plug-in or system-wide setting, works as an overlay that forcibly inverts colours at the browser level rather than adjusting the UI as intended. This can cause significant distortions to images, icons, and visual elements, often making essential content unreadable— for example, a blue sky might turn orange, and important graphs or charts may lose their meaning. Additionally, colour inversion frequently results in inconsistent styling, breaking UI elements, making text difficult to read, and creating poor contrast ratios that worsen accessibility instead of improving it. Users often find themselves constantly adjusting settings, toggling between modes just to complete simple tasks, leading to unnecessary frustration and cognitive load.\n\nIn contrast, native dark mode is designed intentionally within an application to provide a seamless and accessible experience. It ensures proper contrast and readability, preserving the original intent of the design while keeping images and key visual cues intact. Native dark mode works smoothly with assistive technologies, including screen readers, and prevents the need for users to rely on third-party fixes. While plug-in-based colour inversion can serve as a temporary workaround, it is ultimately a patchwork solution that introduces new usability issues, whereas native dark mode provides a structured, user-friendly approach that truly enhances accessibility.\n\nAnother common workaround is colour inversion, available in operating system accessibility settings. This setting flips light to dark and vice versa, making bright screens easier to tolerate. However, this also inverts images, icons, and visual elements, which can:\n\nThis constant toggling between modes adds unnecessary cognitive load and frustration, making simple tasks time-consuming and exhausting.\n\nInstead of relying on overlays and forced inversion, websites and apps should natively support dark mode in their design. A well-implemented dark mode ensures that all visual elements are designed intentionally, avoiding the distortions caused by inversion, colour contrast and legibility are optimised for all users and dark mode can be toggled at the user’s preference, rather than relying on inefficient and frustrating workarounds.\n\nGlobally, over 2.2 billion people have some form of vision impairment, and 1 in 5 people are neurodivergent. Many of these individuals benefit from dark mode, making it a high-impact accessibility feature.\nMoreover, the value of offering dark mode and benefit so many more users. For example\n\nDark mode is not just a design trend—it is a fundamental accessibility need. While WCAG provides a great starting point, lived experience must drive digital accessibility efforts. By offering native dark mode support, organisations can create truly inclusive digital experiences and ensure that all users can engage comfortably and effectively.\n\nAs Mary, our wise blind tester said\n“We know what we need and we know what we want from programmes or apps. So it is always best to ask the user.”\n\nLets start listening on those who rely on accessible online services, rather than obsessing over WCAG conformance.",

    "fullText": "Analysts say benefits could be felt in under-resourced rural hospitals but warn against AI as a cost-cutting measure\n\nFor states to receive certain funding stipulated in the Trump administration’s “big, beautiful” bill, they must meet three of 10 criteria – including integrating more artificial intelligence (AI) technology in healthcare settings – which experts say could have major benefits and liabilities for under-resourced hospitals, depending on how it’s implemented.\n\nThe Rural Health Transformation Fund is a carveout that will provide $50bn over a period of five years to states who meet certain application criteria, including “consumer-facing, technology-driven solutions for the prevention and management of chronic diseases,” and “providing training and technical assistance for the development and adoption of technology-enabled solutions that improve care delivery in rural hospitals, including remote monitoring, robotics, artificial intelligence, and other advanced technologies”.\n\nAnalysts have noted that this $50bn will not be nearly enough to make up for the Congressional Budget Office’s projected $911bn reduction in Medicaid spending over the next decade under the bill (Obba). These cuts will affect both patients who lose free health coverage under Medicaid, and hospitals who benefit from those patients’ Medicaid reimbursements.\n\nChenhao Tan, associate professor of data science at the University of Chicago, and Karni Chagal-Feferkorn, an assistant professor at the University of South Florida’s college of AI and cybersecurity, said AI technology could provide major benefits to rural hospitals that are frequently under-resourced and under-staffed. They also agreed that AI has the potential to alleviate the administrative burden that physicians at these hospitals often face.\n\nPhysicians are responsible for taking detailed notes on patient visits and compiling them for electronic health records systems – a task that can take eight hours or more each week, according to the American Medical Association.\n\nA recent study found that AI generated patient notes are similar in quality to those of general physicians, but worse than those of expert physicians. Tan said that it’s important to take context – like frequent physician burnout in rural hospitals – into account when evaluating risks and benefits.\n\n“If the baseline is tired human doctors, then I think it is even easier to make an argument that AI may do better than them,” Tan said.\n\nChagal-Feferkorn hopes that AI can help alleviate rural hospital staffing issues, not only by reducing the workload but by attracting more doctors.\n\n“If the equipment is state-of-the-art, and they feel that much of the burdensome work is done by AI, I think this could be one incentive for physicians to go work in rural areas, this might have a great impact,” she said.\n\nThe FDA currently regulates AI technologies that are intended to evaluate and diagnose health conditions because they are considered medical devices. However, technologies that simply transcribe and compile patient notes are not regulated, though they may market themselves as Hipaa compliant.\n\nWhile Tan said it would be too high a bar to expect these technologies to be “bulletproof” before they can enter the market, he acknowledged that “there should be something higher than nothing,” in terms of regulatory requirements.\n\nChagal-Feferkorn also said that the proliferation of AI also creates additional cybersecurity concerns.\n\n“AI makes it easier for ordinary people to hack systems,” she said, adding that AI has the potential to improve patient safety by merging patient records from different providers so that, for example, every provider is aware of every medication that a patient is taking and can thus easily avoid dangerous medication interactions.\n\nBut this kind of technology will also require more privacy precautions.\n\n“The more data sharing there is, obviously the risk for data security breach is larger,” Chagal-Feferkorn continued.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, Tan said “worker upscaling needs to go hand in hand” with the adoption of AI technology. But Tan and Chagal-Feferkorn both expressed concern that under-resourced hospitals will attempt to adopt AI technology as a cost-cutting measure without the necessary staff and safety infrastructure.",

    "fullText": "In the following weeks, with further help from me and A.I., Peter made a game based on the light-cycle duels in the movie “Tron,” complete with music and a score-keeping system. He sketched the beginnings of a “library simulator,” and finished his own arcade game, Dot in Space, about a tiny spaceship travelling at warp speed. Whenever he hit a potentially momentum-killing bump in the road, A.I. enabled us to roll through it. At my request, the systems began pointing us toward more sophisticated coding environments—Construct, GDevelop, Godot Engine, GameMaker—and suggesting more ambitious projects. Last weekend, he stayed up late, programming a polished version of Asteroids while wolfing down Cheerios and gulping from his water bottle as though it were an energy drink.\n\nSince Peter is a kid, and I’m a dad, all this can seem cute and quaint. Isn’t it nice that A.I. can help a young person learn to code, and an older one become a coding tutor? But consider what’s happening from a different perspective. In “The Wealth of Nations,” Adam Smith described the “acquired and useful abilities” of a worker as a kind of “fixed capital”—something akin to a hunk of real estate or piece of equipment. It wasn’t until the nineteen-sixties that an economist named Theodore Schultz coined the term “human capital” to describe the ongoing, dynamic process through which people invest in improving themselves. Schultz realized that individuals spend a lot of time, money, and effort becoming more capable. They go to night school, network, read self-help books, and tend to use their free time “to improve skills and knowledge.” The work of improving human capital often happens out of sight. But the “simple truth,” he argued, was “that people invest in themselves and that these investments are very large.” Schultz suggested that these investments, which improve “the quality of human effort,” might account “for most of the impressive rise in the real earnings per worker” that economists had observed in the preceding decades.\n\nToday, it’s obvious that companies and organizations benefit greatly from people with lots of human capital. Meetings are more useful when they involve knowledgeable participants; a product improves when the team building it possesses a wide range of skills. What’s less obvious is that companies and organizations simultaneously struggle to recognize and take advantage of changes in human capital. Suppose someone is hired to do one job, and then acquires skills that qualify her for another. Ideally, the organizational chart would shift around her as she becomes more capable; in practice, the job is often a prison. And when a worker breaks out of that prison, by getting a job elsewhere, she takes her human capital with her. For this reason, from the perspective of the company, it’s almost as though the ideal hire is someone who works feverishly to build up their human capital until their first day of work, and then suddenly slows down, becoming a highly skilled cog in the machine. Organizations want their workers to continue improving themselves—but not too fast, lest they outgrow the systems in which they’re enmeshed.",

    "description": "AI is reshaping the CHRO role, requiring HR leaders to become AI strategists and bridge people, technology, and data in today's workforce.",
    "fullText": "AI is changing how companies hire, train, and lead, and in the process, the chief human resources officer's role is expanding.\n\nToday's top HR leaders are becoming AI strategists, helping their organizations navigate the next wave of workplace transformation.\n\n\"The old model of HR was employees over here, technology over there,\" says Thomas Hutzschenreuter, a university professor at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). \"But the new model of work is human-AI collaboration.\"\n\nAI is a coworker now, he says, and that means that \"HR has a bigger mandate. They need to understand not just people and culture, but go deeper into the strategy, the business, and the technology itself.\"\n\nTo understand how companies are navigating the shift, Business Insider spoke with people leaders at Citizens Bank, one of the largest banks in the Northeast; Boston Consulting Group, a global consultancy; and UiPath, an automation software testing company.\n\nAll interviews have been edited for brevity.\n\nCHROs are becoming the architects of the future of work, bridging people, technology, and data.\n\nThere are many questions we are in the middle of that are germane to how we as an organization move forward, such as: What's going to happen to entry-level roles? What roles are emerging? And how do we reskill people in a way that prepares them to make shifts thoughtfully?\n\nWe need people who can quickly learn, adapt, and change. Our technologists need to develop their business acumen, and our business folks need to develop their digital and technical fluency. The lines are blurring.\n\nMy HR team is developing a baseline of skills and capabilities. We're having conversations with consulting partners and clients. There's an openness to communal learning because everyone is trying to figure out the same things: what the AI-driven workforce will look like, how to break work into tasks for AI vs. humans, and what AI agents can handle versus humans.\n\nWe're subject to a lot of regulatory oversight in our industry. It's great that people can develop their own AI agents — there's a push to decentralize these capabilities — but we need to be mindful of risk and governance and how we do this in a safe, ethical way.\n\nAI is changing how work gets done and what work gets done. Business models are evolving, and the way companies serve clients is shifting. The CHRO role now requires adapting to both at once. It's a tall order.\n\nIn consulting, our ability to add value means constantly evolving our approach to human capital. The issues are constant; the pace is what's different. Today, a quarter of our business involves AI, which wasn't true even two years ago.\n\nWe need our people to be AI fluent. About 90% of our workforce uses AI regularly, and more than half use it daily. To get there, we've built a multi-layered support system: a 1,400-person enablement network acting as evangelists and coaches.\n\nWe've upskilled more than 100 team coaches to provide hands-on support. We deploy experts directly into teams to help them reimagine workflows and run innovation competitions to keep momentum going.\n\nOur HR team has taken the lead. We started with recruiting — consolidating six IT systems into one and integrating AI throughout the platform and across performance management and development.\n\nWe're also experimenting with voice tools, chat interfaces, and AI avatars for real-time coaching. These tools give employees confidence, learning opportunities, and instant feedback. They don't replace managers — they free them up for higher-level thinking and relationship-building.\n\nOur business is automation, so that muscle is very strong for my team. But the next frontier of agentic AI is an adjustment.\n\nWe're using these AI agents — but we're also creating them. One agent, almost in production, helps with performance reviews, which is a time-consuming and sometimes dreaded task. Our agent helps employees write their self-assessment and collects feedback, bringing it together much quicker. It also helps managers by consolidating feedback from multiple resources.\n\nIt won't make rating decisions on the manager's behalf, but it makes the year-end much more seamless. Instead of spending time on admin, managers can focus on the feedback itself and my team on the right framework for career development.\n\nThere are a lot of unknowns at the moment, and fear is natural. But it should fuel curiosity and development. This is the time to think about career development seriously.\n\nWe have this idea that AI is only affecting entry-level or lower-level jobs. The truth is that technology is replacing skills that very highly skilled people have been doing.\n\nIf you look at the medical field and aviation — areas where we always thought technology wouldn't touch — that's no longer the case. It's not going to happen overnight. We have time to prepare. But it's relevant for everybody in any profession.",

    "description": "AI disrupts ARR: Startups and SaaS firms face new hybrid valuation models as investors prioritize usage, efficiency, and outcome-based metrics.",
    "fullText": "Startups and other tech companies love to boast about \"annual recurring revenue.\" AI could make this metric obsolete, though.\n\nAccording to a new report by consultant AlixPartners, investors are on the cusp of abandoning the traditional ARR-multiple playbook that defined the SaaS era. In its place will emerge hybrid valuation models that reward companies not for the size of their subscription base but for how effectively they use AI to elevate customer outcomes.\n\nFor decades, ARR served as the bedrock for valuing enterprise software firms. It measures revenue from subscriptions by taking the value of current contracts and extrapolating that out over a full year.\n\nAlixPartners now argues that ARR is becoming increasingly \"meaningless\" in an AI-first economy, especially as usage- and outcome-based business models replace the per-seat licenses that have dominated the SaaS industry.\n\nThe big change is related to how expensive AI models are to run. Every time a new AI software service taps into this intelligence, the provider has to pay a per-token price. That makes fixed, per-seat SaaS subscriptions tougher to offer.\n\nThis means revenue could fluctuate \n\nAlixPartners says investors are already shifting focus toward a hybrid valuation approach in the AI era:\n\n• AI leverage ratios — These measure how effectively companies convert AI investments into revenue and margin gains. Rather than rewarding scale for its own sake, investors will reward operational efficiency and automation-driven profitability.\n\n• Outcome-based performance benchmarks — Metrics such as customer margin expansion, reduced task completion time, or increased throughput will matter more than raw seat-based user counts.\n\n• Traditional ARR multiples — Still relevant but no longer sufficient on their own.\n\nNew forecasting metrics, such as \"time to usage,\" \"usage ramp rate,\" and \"usage volatility,\" are emerging to help investors gauge how quickly customers adopt AI features and how stable their consumption patterns are over time.\n\nThe message is clear: In the AI era, value follows impact. Companies that can demonstrate real productivity gains for customers and operational leverage for themselves will earn premium valuations. Those clinging to legacy ARR-driven models risk being left behind as investors pivot to frameworks that better capture the economics of intelligent software.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Disney CEO Bob Iger said the company's licensing deal with OpenAI will let it capitalize on a fast-growing technology and engage younger audiences.",
    "fullText": "Disney CEO Bob Iger says his company's major licensing deal with OpenAI is all about establishing a foothold in a new realm of entertainment and engaging younger audiences.\n\nThe licensing agreement gives ChatGPT and OpenAI's Sora video platform access to Disney characters like Mickey Mouse and Darth Vader. Disney is also investing $1 billion in the AI company and becoming a \"major customer.\"\n\nSpeaking on CNBC about the deal with OpenAI's Sam Altman on Thursday, Iger said it gives Disney a chance to get in on a fast-growing area of tech.\n\n\"It gives us an opportunity, really, to play a part in what is really a breathtaking, breathtaking growth in essentially AI and new forms of media and entertainment,\" Iger said.\n\nIger said the deal also fulfills a longtime desire by Disney to put user-generated content on its Disney+ streaming platform. Disney initially plans to put select videos created on Sora onto Disney+ to increase engagement with users, especially younger ones. Ultimately, Iger wants to let Disney+ users create such videos within the platform itself.\n\n\"That's a big step for us,\" he said.\n\nDisney has long been highly protective of its famous characters and storylines, and Iger is widely seen in Hollywood as a champion of the creative set. But like other entertainment players, Disney has an engagement problem. The time people spend on streaming has stayed essentially flat over the past few years, despite increased spending on content. Social media and user-generated content, in contrast, continue to rise. The bet with OpenAI is that the deal can get people to spend more time on Disney platforms by giving them new ways to play around with its famous franchises.\n\nIger has long positioned the company as pro-technology, and he said, in reference to the OpenAI deal, that he'd rather participate in technological innovation than be disrupted by it.\n\n\"We think this is actually a way for us to be part of these developments, as opposed to being harmed by them,\" he said.\n\nIger said the deal is also a way for Disney to participate in the big rise in user-generated short-form video on social-media platforms.\n\nAltman said Thursday that the demand for Disney characters, in particular, is \"off the charts\" on OpenAI's products. He said he sees the deal enabling people to do things like putting themselves in a lightsaber scene from \"Star Wars\" or creating a custom birthday video for their kid using the Buzz Lightyear character.\n\nAI firms have been \"frenemies\" to media companies, as many in Hollywood are concerned about how they use copyrighted material and the threat that they could pose to the creative process. Iger said the OpenAI deal is good for creators rather than a threat.\n\n\"This does not in any way represent a threat to the creators at all. In fact, the opposite,\" Iger said. \"I think it honors them and respects them, in part because there's a license to be associated with it.\"\n\nDisney said the agreement does not include any talent likeness or voices and that OpenAI would have guardrails in place to make sure Disney's IP was used in a safe way.\n\nIn June, Disney, along with Comcast's NBCUniversal studio business, sued AI company Midjourney, claiming its tech created unauthorized copies of works ranging from Star Wars to The Simpsons. Midjourney denied the claims in its legal response. That suit is ongoing.",

    "description": "Archaeologists have found the earliest evidence yet of fire technology — and it was created by Neanderthals in England more than 400,000 years ago.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nNeanderthals were the world's first innovators of fire technology, tiny specks of evidence in England suggest. Flecks of pyrite found at a more than 400,000-year-old archaeological site in Suffolk, in eastern England, push back archaeologists' evidence for controlled fire-making and suggest that key human brain developments began far earlier than previously thought.\n\n\"We're a species who've used fire to really shape the world around us,\" study co-author Rob Davis, a Paleolithic archaeologist at the British Museum, said in a news conference on Tuesday (Dec. 9). \"The ability to make fire would have been critically important\" in human evolution, Davis said, \"accelerating evolutionary trends\" such as developing larger brains, maintaining larger social groups, and increasing language skills.\n\nSince 2013, Davis and colleagues have been excavating an archaeological site in England called Barnham, which yielded stone tools, burnt sediment and charcoal from 400,000 years ago. In a study published Wednesday (Dec. 10) in the journal Nature, the researchers revealed that the site contained the world's earliest direct evidence of fire-making — and that this fire technology was likely pioneered by Neanderthals.\n\nBarnham was first recognized as a Paleolithic human site in the early 1900s due to the presence of stone tools. But recent excavations uncovered evidence of ancient human groups occupying the area more than 415,000 years ago, when Barnham was a small, seasonal watering hole in a woodland depression.\n\nIn one corner of the site, archaeologists found a concentration of heat-shattered hand axes as well as a zone of reddened clay. Through a series of scientific analyses, the researchers discovered that the reddened clay had been subjected to repeated, localized burning, which suggested the area may have been an ancient hearth.\n\n\"The big turning point came with the discovery of iron pyrite,\" study co-author Nick Ashton, curator of Paleolithic collections at the British Museum, said in the news conference.\n\nPyrite, also known as fool's gold, is a naturally occurring mineral that can produce sparks when struck against flint. While pyrite is found in many locations around the world, it is extremely rare in the Barnham area, meaning someone specifically brought pyrite to the site, probably with the aim of making fire, the researchers said in the study.\n\nBecause of the importance of controlled fire, paleoanthropologists have long debated the timing of this invention.\n\n\"There are so many obvious advantages to fire, from cooking to protection from predators to its technological use in creating new types of artifacts to its ability to bring people together,\" April Nowell, a Paleolithic archaeologist at the University of Victoria in Canada who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. \"We only have to think of our own childhoods gathering around a campfire to understand its emotional resonance.\"\n\nResearchers believe that early humans first used wildfires for cooking food. This was a crucial step in human evolution because cooking widened the range of food available and made it more digestible, which in turn provided more nutrients needed to grow a larger brain, Davis said.\n\nBut there is limited evidence for deliberate early fire technology, and that evidence is often ambiguous, the researchers noted in the study.\n\nFor example, scientists unearthed reddened sediment at Koobi Fora in Kenya that dated to about 1.5 million years ago. Researchers suggested it could hint at early fire use because the key hominin at the site — Homo erectus — had a fairly large brain. And at two sites in Israel dated to about 800,000 years ago, burnt animal bones and stone tools suggest possible control of fire by the human ancestors who lived there.\n\nFire technology then exploded around 400,000 years ago. Archaeologists have found evidence of burning at cave sites in France, Portugal, Spain, Ukraine and the U.K., and then more widespread use of fire in Europe, Africa and the Levant (the region around the east Mediterranean) by 200,000 years ago.\n\nBut these previous examples do not show the same kind of conclusive geochemical evidence of fire making that was found at Barnham, Ashton argued. He called the team's careful analysis of the Barnham sediment and identification of pyrite \"the most exciting discovery in my 40-year career.\"\n\nHowever, any bones at Barnham have since disintegrated, so the \"smoking gun\" of butchered and burned animal bones that could prove the site was used for cooking has not been found.\n\nThis also means there are no skeletal remains of the fire producers themselves at Barnham — but study co-author Chris Stringer, a paleoanthropologist at the National History Museum in London, has a guess about their identity.\n\n\"We assume that the fires at Barnham were being made by early Neanderthals,\" Stringer said in the news conference, based on a nearby site called Swanscombe, where Neanderthal skull bones were discovered that dated to the same time period as Barnham.\n\nWhile experts have known for about a decade that some Neanderthals could make fire, that evidence goes back only 50,000 years. The Barnham finds push that date 350,000 years further back, suggesting Neanderthals were much smarter than most people give them credit for.\n\nNeanderthals \"are fully human,\" Stringer said. \"They have complex behavior, they're adapting to new environments, and their brains are as large as ours. They're very evolved humans.\"\n\nNowell said that the study's results add fuel to a larger debate about Neanderthals' control of fire and their social and cultural use of it.\n\n\"There is a lot of discussion right now about whether all Neanderthals made fire or if it is only some Neanderthals at some times and places that made fire,\" Nowell said. The new study \"is another important data point in our understanding of Neanderthal pyrotechnical capabilities with all that implies cognitively, socially and technologically.\"\n\nIf the researchers are correct that Neanderthals made fire from flint and pyrite more than 400,000 years ago in England, this raises additional questions, Nowell said.\n\n—Neanderthals could be brought back within 20 years — but is it a good idea?\n\n—Neanderthals cannibalized 'outsider' women and children 45,000 years ago at cave in Belgium\n\n—'Perfectly preserved' Neanderthal skull bones suggest their noses didn't evolve to warm air\n\n\"Despite its obvious advantages, questions remain about the nature of early fire use: When did fire use become a regular part of the human behavioral repertoire? Were early humans dependent on the opportunistic use of wildfires and lightning strikes? Was fire rediscovered multiple times?\" Nowell said.\n\nThe ancestors of Homo sapiens were living in Africa 400,000 years ago and not likely interacting with early Neanderthals half a world away.\n\n\"We don't know if Homo sapiens at that date had the ability to make fire,\" Stringer said, because to date there is no clear evidence for control of fire any earlier than Barnham.\n\nThis means that Neanderthals may have invented ways to make and control fire somewhere in continental Europe, which then enabled our human cousins to move further north into England, heating and lighting their way with fire.\n\n\"It's plausible that fire became more controlled in Europe and spread to Africa,\" Ashton said. \"We have to keep an open mind.\"",

    "description": "Companies are pouring money into AI but failing to translate that investment into workforce capability, largely because traditional training methods don’t help employees retain or apply complex skills. Extended reality—virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality—bridges this gap by letting people learn through immersive, emotionally engaging, hands-on experiences that the brain encodes like real events. Organizations from Bank of America to Boeing to Walmart are already seeing faster learning, higher confidence, reduced errors, and lower costs by using XR to train employees in everything from customer-service scenarios to technical assembly. The technology works because it aligns with how people actually learn, benefits from major improvements in affordability and accessibility, and meets the expectations of a workforce already accustomed to immersive digital environments. The companies that start with focused pilot projects, match the right XR tool to the right skill gaps, and scale deliberately will build training systems that actually change behavior and materially improve performance.",

    "description": "Export-controlled technology worth US$30 million with fake brand labels was allegedly addressed to a facility near Toronto’s Pearson airport",
    "fullText": "A Chinese-born Canadian citizen who lives in Mississauga, Ont., was arrested in Virginia by the FBI and charged with trying to smuggle restricted high-tech Nvidia computer chips used in AI processing to China\n\nU.S. authorities seized export-controlled technology worth about $30 million that was addressed to an air freight facility in Mississauga, close to Toronto Pearson International Airport, according to allegations filed in court.\n\nNvidia labels on the components had been removed and replaced with labels for a fake company, authorities said.\n\nThe arrest of Benlin Yuan, of Mississauga, immediately west of Toronto, and the large shipment destined for Toronto are part of Operation Gatekeeper, described by U.S. authorities as targeting “a sophisticated illicit procurement conspiracy and smuggling network that orchestrates buying and exporting controlled high-tech computer chips to China.”\n\nYuan is described in U.S. prosecution documents as president of an information technology company based in Virginia that provides data centre services and IT support and consulting in Canada and the United States. The documents say it is a subsidiary of a Chinese company based in Beijing.\n\nHe was arrested in Sterling, Virginia, on Nov. 28 and charged with conspiring to violate export control acts.\n\nThe network is accused of purchasing at least US$50 million worth of GPUs from a large U.S. technology company.\n\nThe computer products Yuan is alleged to be involved in exporting are Nvidia A100, H100, and H200 Tensor Core graphic processing units, known as GPUs, and HGX baseboards. The equipment is used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications and in high-performance computing. The chips can handle huge amounts of data that is needed in AI applications, an exploding field that is revolutionizing technology.\n\nThe GPUs can perform calculations at higher speeds than most previous computers.\n\nSince about November 2023, a Chinese company has worked to import these chips from the United States, prosecutors allege. The entire plot is alleged to have involved US$160 million in tech goods.\n\nYuan is accused of joining the conspiracy this spring.\n\nIn a criminal complaint sworn by a special agent in the U.S. Department of Commerce, Yuan helped buy the technology using straw purchasers and intermediaries, meaning in the name of a person or company that is not the real end buyer.\n\nThe buyers allegedly declared the goods were for use by customers within the United States or in countries that do not require an export licence, including Taiwan and Thailand.\n\nAt various U.S. warehouses, Nvidia labels were allegedly removed from the computer circuits and relabeled with a fake manufacturing brand of SANDKYAN, according to the criminal complaint against Yuan.\n\nWhen preparing the items for export, the shipping paperwork misclassified the products as harmless and unrestricted pieces of tech: “adapters,” “adapter modules,” and “computer controllers,” authorities claim.\n\nThey were then shipped, directly or indirectly, to China.\n\nInvestigators received a tip about pallets of suspicious GPUs at a New Jersey warehouse that were addressed to companies in China.\n\nAn undercover agent was sent inside, where he spent an hour.\n\nThe agent allegedly saw two engineers who appeared to be of Chinese origin unboxing Nvidia components. One of the engineers spoke to the undercover agent in Mandarin, documents say. The engineers said they had to cover up all of the Nvidia branding on the equipment for “export purposes,” court filings allege.\n\nThe agent watched Nvidia labels being pulled off and new ones for the fake firm put in their place. The next day the agent returned and found the boxes had been resealed. The products were now labeled as having been “Made in Taiwan.”\n\nNot only were those packages addressed for shipping to Toronto, but warehouse employees told agents they recently had several similar tech exports to Canada.\n\nThe packages were removed and secured in a government warehouse. That sparked a flow of complaint calls and demand letters about the missing GPUs. The people expecting the goods believed the undercover officer had stolen the products and started negotiating to have them returned, authorities allege.\n\nThey offered $1 million to get their packages back, but insisted the equipment be inspected before payment was made.\n\nYuan is accused of organizing the “inspection.”\n\nHe is accused of recruiting and arranging the group of inspectors and of being one of the six who arrived to examine the packages, about two weeks after the seizure, court filings allege.\n\nThe inspection arrangements were allegedly planned in a group chat using an encrypted communication app and confirmed later over a video conferencing app.\n\nYuan was told by a high-level representative of the buyer in China to make sure no one said the items were destined for China, according to the criminal complaint. He is accused of helping them develop an elaborate “compliance backstory” to justify the products based on false information.\n\nThey also allegedly discussed how to make the million-dollar payment and Yuan was told to send copies of the driver’s licences of everyone on the inspection team. Three trucks were arranged for the pick up.\n\nHe is also accused of handling the storage of a different shipment of Nvidia products destined for China. A cooperating witness for U.S. prosecutors alleged that Yuan told him not to put fake labels on this one as he thought they looked suspicious; he would rather the Nvidia labels just be removed.\n\nAlexander Blanchard, a Virginia-based lawyer for Yuan, declined to comment about Yuan or the case when asked by National Post.\n\n“Operation Gatekeeper has exposed a sophisticated smuggling network that threatens our nation’s security by funneling cutting-edge AI technology to those who would use it against American interests,” said Nicholas Ganjei, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas.\n\n“These chips are the building blocks of AI superiority and are integral to modern military applications. The country that controls these chips will control AI technology; the country that controls AI technology will control the future.”\n\nU.S. regulation restricts the export of items that could make a significant contribution to the military potential of other nations or could be detrimental to the foreign policy or national security of the United States.\n\nAdvanced computing integrated circuits, including certain Nvidia-manufactured GPUs were added to the export restriction list in 2022. Some of the latest Nvidia chips have been classed by the U.S. as “critical technologies” that China could use to “modernize its military capabilities in ways that threaten the national security interests of the United States and its allies,” according to export regulations.\n\nThe chips require a special licence to export to China.\n\nOn Monday, the same day Operation Gatekeeper was announced, U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States will allow Nvidia’s H200 processors to be exported to China with a 25 per cent fee.\n\nAlan Hao Hsu, also known as Haochun Hsu, 43, of Missouri City, Texas, and his company both pleaded guilty to smuggling and unlawful export activities in October as part of Operation Gatekeeper.\n\nNewly unsealed court documents say Hsu received more than US$50 million in wire transfers from China to help fund the scheme. He is scheduled for sentencing in February.\n\nFanyue Gong, also known as Tom Gong, 43, a citizen of China who lives in Brooklyn, New York, was also charged in the probe. He is described as the owner of a New York technology company. He was arrested in New York on Dec. 3, and charged with conspiring to smuggle goods out of the United States.\n\nFive unnamed co-conspirators are linked to IT companies based in Hong Kong or Shenzhen, a city on the Pearl River that acts as a bridge between Hong Kong and mainland China.\n\n• Email: ahumphreys@postmedia.com | X: AD_Humphreys\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Campaign urges PM to show independence from US and push to rein in development of superintelligence\n\nMore than 100 UK parliamentarians are calling on the government to introduce binding regulations on the most powerful AI systems as concern grows that ministers are moving too slowly to create safeguards in the face of lobbying from the technology industry.\n\nA former AI minister and defence secretary are part of a cross-party group of Westminster MPs, peers and elected members of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish legislatures demanding stricter controls on frontier systems, citing fears superintelligent AI “would compromise national and global security”.\n\nThe push for tougher regulation is being coordinated by a nonprofit organisation called Control AI whose backers include the co-founder of Skype, Jaan Tallinn. It is calling on Keir Starmer to show independence from Donald Trump’s White House, which opposes the regulation of AI. One of the “godfathers” of the technology, Yoshua Bengio, recently said it was less regulated than a sandwich.\n\nThe campaigners include the Labour peer and former defence secretary Des Browne, who said superintelligent AI “would be the most perilous technological development since we gained the ability to wage nuclear war”. He said only international cooperation “can prevent a reckless race for advantage that could imperil us all”.\n\nThe Conservative peer and former environment minister Zac Goldsmith said that “even while very significant and senior figures in AI are blowing the whistle, governments are miles behind the AI companies and are leaving them to pursue its development with virtually no regulation”.\n\nBritain hosted an AI safety summit at Bletchley Park in 2023, which concluded there was “potential for serious, even catastrophic, harm, either deliberate or unintentional” from the most advanced AI systems. It set up the AI Safety Institute, now called the AI Security Institute, which has become an internationally respected body. Less emphasis, however, has been placed on the summit’s call to address risks through international cooperation.\n\nGoldsmith said the UK should “resume its global leadership on AI security by championing an international agreement to prohibit the development of superintelligence until we know what we are dealing with and how to contain it”.\n\nThe calls for state intervention in the AI race come after one of Silicon Valley’s leading AI scientists told the Guardian humanity would have to decide by 2030 whether to take the “ultimate risk” of letting AI systems train themselves to become more powerful. Jared Kaplan, the co-founder and chief scientist at frontier AI company Anthropic, said: “We don’t really want it to be a Sputnik-like situation where the government suddenly wakes up and is like: Oh, wow, AI is a big deal.”\n\nLabour’s programme set out in July 2024 said it would legislate “to place requirements on those working to develop the most powerful artificial intelligence models”. But no bill has been published and the government has faced White House pressure not to inhibit commercial AI development, mostly pioneered by US firms.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said: “AI is already regulated in the UK, with a range of existing rules already in place. We have been clear on the need to ensure the UK and its laws are ready for the challenges and opportunities AI will bring and that position has not changed.”\n\nThe bishop of Oxford, Steven Croft, who is backing the Control AI campaign, called for an independent AI watchdog to scrutinise public sector use and for AI companies to be required to meet minimum testing standards before releasing new models.\n\n“There are all kinds of risks and the government doesn’t seem to have adopted a precautionary principle,” he said. “At the moment there are significant risks: the mental health of children and adults, the environmental costs and other big risks in terms of the alignment of generalised AI and [the question of] what is good for humanity. The government seems to be moving away from regulation.”\n\nThe UK’s first AI minister under Rishi Sunak, Jonathan Berry, said the time was coming when binding regulations should be applied to models that present existential risks. He said rules should be global and would create tripwires so if AI models reached a certain power their makers would have to show they had been tested, designed with off switches and were capable of being retrained.\n\n“International frontier AI safety has not gone on in leaps and bounds as we had hoped,” he said. He cited recent cases of chatbots being involved in encouraging suicides, people using them as therapists and believing they are gods. “The risks, now, are very serious and we need to be constantly on our guard,” he said.\n\nThe chief executive of Control AI, Andrea Miotti, criticised the current “timid approach” and said: “There has been a lot of lobbying from the UK and US. AI companies are lobbying governments in the UK and US to stall regulation arguing it is premature and would crush innovation. Some of these are the same companies who say AIs could destroy humanity.”\n\nHe said the speed with which AI technology was advancing meant mandatory standards could be needed in the next one or two years.",
