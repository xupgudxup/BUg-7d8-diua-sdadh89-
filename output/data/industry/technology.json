    "description": "The PUBG: Battlegrounds franchise is about to expand with the debut of a new extraction shooter, PUBG: Black Budget. Krafton has also announced that PUBG Studios will have a closed alpha test for Black Budget in December on PC.\nPUBG: Black Budget is introducing more sci-fi and fantasy elements by setting the action on Coli, an island that is locked in a repeating time loop while under threat from the Anomaly, a supernatural phenomenon of unknown origin. The game will also place an emphasis on \"exploration and discovery\" instead of relying on non-stop combat. Players are tasked with finding \"top-secret technology\" while attempting to learn more about SAPIENS, a black-budget initiative.",

    "description": "Most AI initiatives fail not because the models are weak, but because organizations aren’t built to sustain them. A large Latin American conglomerate developed a simple management system that aligns roles, responsibilities, and routines so AI projects move from isolated pilots to enterprise-wide impact. Its approach shows that scaling AI is less about technology and more about creating the organizational backbone that turns experiments into measurable business results.",

    "description": "Many of today’s toughest strategic challenges are “wicked problems”—issues shaped by tangled variables, shifting outcomes, and stakeholder complexity that overwhelm traditional analytics. Quantum modelling offers a new way forward. Even without quantum computers, quantum-inspired models running on conventional hardware can evaluate interdependent variables simultaneously, revealing patterns linear, regression-based tools can’t capture. Unlike traditional models that assume independent causes, quantum modelling analyzes entangled combinations of variables to explain outcomes more accurately. To make use of this technology, companies need to start small, partner smartly, and build quantum literacy.",

The company aims to grow its 1,700-strong workforce in India by 15% annually over the ‌next three years, Navin Bishnoi said in an interview on Wednesday, but refrained from giving details of the expanded research and development budget.  India contributes a small portion of Marvell's revenue, but Bishnoi expects that to grow ‍as local data center capacity expands and data protection laws tighten.",
