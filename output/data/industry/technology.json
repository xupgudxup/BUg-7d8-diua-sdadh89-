    "title": "Dark mode is essential, not a design preference",
    "description": "Dark mode is often treated as a nice-to-have rather than a necessity or assistive technology.",
    "fullText": "Dark mode has emerged as one of the most significant accessibility considerations in digital design, yet it is still often treated as a nice-to-have rather than a fundamental feature. Many organisations adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure accessibility compliance, but compliance does not always equate to usability.\n\nFor blind and low-vision users, as well as some neurodivergent individuals, dark mode is not just a preference—it is a necessity. It reduces glare, enhances contrast, and extends the time users can comfortably engage with digital content. Without it, users experience fatigue, headaches, and even an inability to complete tasks, ultimately leading to frustration, abandonment, and exclusion from digital services.\n\nWhen we speak directly to users with lived experience, the importance of dark mode becomes even clearer.\n\nDaniel describes why his phone is permanently set to dark mode:\n\n“My phone's permanently set on a dark mode to reduce the glare of any of the white screens or anything just blasting me in the eyes. It helps me use screens for longer so my eyes don't get as fatigued at the end of the day. Even people who have lost 99% of their vision still have a light sensitivity.”\n\nThis statement challenges a common misconception about blindness—many blind individuals still have some residual vision, and light sensitivity remains a significant issue. For them, bright screens are not just inconvenient; they are painful and actively reduce their ability to engage in digital work and communication.\n\nDan emphasises the connection between screen brightness and headaches and fatigue:\n“When you have this bright light just blasting you in the eyes, it's painful, it gives you headaches. Most of your job you're doing these days, you're looking at a computer screen. There are very few jobs where you're not looking at a computer screen. So if you want to extend how long you're able to do that work for, you need to try and get the most favourable conditions for your eyes.”\n\nThis highlights the occupational accessibility barriers that bright screens create. Digital tools should empower people to work efficiently, not force them into discomfort and early fatigue.\nAnother challenge with bright white backgrounds is the way it affects readability:\n“A bright white background is an issue because it causes bleeding into the other colours. So if you have thin black writing on a white background, the white's so bright that it kind of makes it hard to look at the black writing.”\n\nThis phenomenon, known as halation, makes text appear blurred or distorted for many users, reducing legibility and comprehension. Conversely, dark backgrounds with white text provide greater clarity. Patrick, who has a degenerative eye condition explains:\n“White text on a black background doesn't just look cool, it's much easier on the eyes. When I used white on black, it was easier because the print would stand out much more. Even looking at the time was much easier. The numbers would just jump at you.”\n\nFor users with low vision, neurodivergent conditions like dyslexia, and even those experiencing age-related vision decline, dark mode significantly improves readability and usability.\n\nDespite dark mode's widespread popularity, there is surprisingly little formal research or quantitative data on its accessibility benefits. However, after aggregating insights across multiple See Me Please user testing projects—each involving 18 diverse participants, including 3 blind, 3 with low vision, 3 neurodivergent, 3 Deaf or Hard of Hearing, 3 over 70, and 3 with limited English proficiency—we were struck by how often dark mode emerged as the most requested feature. It was consistently the top accessibility request across companies, often ranking higher than other common accessibility improvements. Based on our experience, we estimate that around 75% of our low vision testers and at least half of our blind testers express a strong preference or need for dark mode.\n\nThis aligns with broader user preferences, as many others—including neurodivergent users and those sensitive to screen brightness—also value dark mode for comfort and usability. While accessibility standards often overlook dark mode, our findings suggest it is a critical feature that enhances real-world usability for a wide range of users.\n\nDesign and development teams only have so much capacity, and when considering investments in accessibility, it's crucial to prioritise features that deliver the greatest impact for users. Our user testing strongly suggests that dark mode is not just a preference but a necessity, resonating far more than the collective value placed on embedded read-aloud features, which are often included on websites but rarely requested by people with a disability with the same urgency. If organisations are weighing accessibility investments, particularly in enterprise settings, thinking about how dark mode can be integrated—at least in new applications—could provide far greater usability benefits than other commonly implemented accessibility features\n\nWCAG provides an essential foundation for digital accessibility, yet it does not specifically require dark mode support. While it recommends sufficient contrast (WCAG 2.1, Success Criterion 1.4.3), the standard does not ensure that interfaces are comfortable for all users.\nStudies on dark mode’s impact show that:\n\nDespite these benefits, many organisations assume meeting WCAG contrast requirements is enough. However, true accessibility is about usability, not just compliance. If a user is technically able to read content but experiences discomfort, pain, or excessive strain, that content is not truly accessible.\n\nWithout dark mode, users often face severe consequences:\n\nFor businesses and government agencies, failing to offer dark mode creates barriers to service access, particularly for those who rely on assistive technologies.\n\nMany users rely on plug-ins and third-party tools like Dark Reader, Midnight Lizard, and Stylus to force dark mode on websites that don’t natively support it. While these tools provide short-term solutions, they are essentially overlays, which introduce several accessibility issues.\n\nOverlays modify the display at the browser level, rather than adjusting the UI in a way that is intended, tested, or optimised by the original developers. This can cause:\n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions about overlays is that they solve accessibility problems. In reality, they often introduce new barriers rather than removing them.\n\nThe key difference between pushing colour inversion with a plug-in versus native dark mode comes down to control and consistency. Colour inversion, when applied through a plug-in or system-wide setting, works as an overlay that forcibly inverts colours at the browser level rather than adjusting the UI as intended. This can cause significant distortions to images, icons, and visual elements, often making essential content unreadable— for example, a blue sky might turn orange, and important graphs or charts may lose their meaning. Additionally, colour inversion frequently results in inconsistent styling, breaking UI elements, making text difficult to read, and creating poor contrast ratios that worsen accessibility instead of improving it. Users often find themselves constantly adjusting settings, toggling between modes just to complete simple tasks, leading to unnecessary frustration and cognitive load.\n\nIn contrast, native dark mode is designed intentionally within an application to provide a seamless and accessible experience. It ensures proper contrast and readability, preserving the original intent of the design while keeping images and key visual cues intact. Native dark mode works smoothly with assistive technologies, including screen readers, and prevents the need for users to rely on third-party fixes. While plug-in-based colour inversion can serve as a temporary workaround, it is ultimately a patchwork solution that introduces new usability issues, whereas native dark mode provides a structured, user-friendly approach that truly enhances accessibility.\n\nAnother common workaround is colour inversion, available in operating system accessibility settings. This setting flips light to dark and vice versa, making bright screens easier to tolerate. However, this also inverts images, icons, and visual elements, which can:\n\nThis constant toggling between modes adds unnecessary cognitive load and frustration, making simple tasks time-consuming and exhausting.\n\nInstead of relying on overlays and forced inversion, websites and apps should natively support dark mode in their design. A well-implemented dark mode ensures that all visual elements are designed intentionally, avoiding the distortions caused by inversion, colour contrast and legibility are optimised for all users and dark mode can be toggled at the user’s preference, rather than relying on inefficient and frustrating workarounds.\n\nGlobally, over 2.2 billion people have some form of vision impairment, and 1 in 5 people are neurodivergent. Many of these individuals benefit from dark mode, making it a high-impact accessibility feature.\nMoreover, the value of offering dark mode and benefit so many more users. For example\n\nDark mode is not just a design trend—it is a fundamental accessibility need. While WCAG provides a great starting point, lived experience must drive digital accessibility efforts. By offering native dark mode support, organisations can create truly inclusive digital experiences and ensure that all users can engage comfortably and effectively.\n\nAs Mary, our wise blind tester said\n“We know what we need and we know what we want from programmes or apps. So it is always best to ask the user.”\n\nLets start listening on those who rely on accessible online services, rather than obsessing over WCAG conformance.",

    "fullText": "Analysts say benefits could be felt in under-resourced rural hospitals but warn against AI as a cost-cutting measure\n\nFor states to receive certain funding stipulated in the Trump administration’s “big, beautiful” bill, they must meet three of 10 criteria – including integrating more artificial intelligence (AI) technology in healthcare settings – which experts say could have major benefits and liabilities for under-resourced hospitals, depending on how it’s implemented.\n\nThe Rural Health Transformation Fund is a carveout that will provide $50bn over a period of five years to states who meet certain application criteria, including “consumer-facing, technology-driven solutions for the prevention and management of chronic diseases,” and “providing training and technical assistance for the development and adoption of technology-enabled solutions that improve care delivery in rural hospitals, including remote monitoring, robotics, artificial intelligence, and other advanced technologies”.\n\nAnalysts have noted that this $50bn will not be nearly enough to make up for the Congressional Budget Office’s projected $911bn reduction in Medicaid spending over the next decade under the bill (Obba). These cuts will affect both patients who lose free health coverage under Medicaid, and hospitals who benefit from those patients’ Medicaid reimbursements.\n\nChenhao Tan, associate professor of data science at the University of Chicago, and Karni Chagal-Feferkorn, an assistant professor at the University of South Florida’s college of AI and cybersecurity, said AI technology could provide major benefits to rural hospitals that are frequently under-resourced and under-staffed. They also agreed that AI has the potential to alleviate the administrative burden that physicians at these hospitals often face.\n\nPhysicians are responsible for taking detailed notes on patient visits and compiling them for electronic health records systems – a task that can take eight hours or more each week, according to the American Medical Association.\n\nA recent study found that AI generated patient notes are similar in quality to those of general physicians, but worse than those of expert physicians. Tan said that it’s important to take context – like frequent physician burnout in rural hospitals – into account when evaluating risks and benefits.\n\n“If the baseline is tired human doctors, then I think it is even easier to make an argument that AI may do better than them,” Tan said.\n\nChagal-Feferkorn hopes that AI can help alleviate rural hospital staffing issues, not only by reducing the workload but by attracting more doctors.\n\n“If the equipment is state-of-the-art, and they feel that much of the burdensome work is done by AI, I think this could be one incentive for physicians to go work in rural areas, this might have a great impact,” she said.\n\nThe FDA currently regulates AI technologies that are intended to evaluate and diagnose health conditions because they are considered medical devices. However, technologies that simply transcribe and compile patient notes are not regulated, though they may market themselves as Hipaa compliant.\n\nWhile Tan said it would be too high a bar to expect these technologies to be “bulletproof” before they can enter the market, he acknowledged that “there should be something higher than nothing,” in terms of regulatory requirements.\n\nChagal-Feferkorn also said that the proliferation of AI also creates additional cybersecurity concerns.\n\n“AI makes it easier for ordinary people to hack systems,” she said, adding that AI has the potential to improve patient safety by merging patient records from different providers so that, for example, every provider is aware of every medication that a patient is taking and can thus easily avoid dangerous medication interactions.\n\nBut this kind of technology will also require more privacy precautions.\n\n“The more data sharing there is, obviously the risk for data security breach is larger,” Chagal-Feferkorn continued.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, Tan said “worker upscaling needs to go hand in hand” with the adoption of AI technology. But Tan and Chagal-Feferkorn both expressed concern that under-resourced hospitals will attempt to adopt AI technology as a cost-cutting measure without the necessary staff and safety infrastructure.",

    "fullText": "In the following weeks, with further help from me and A.I., Peter made a game based on the light-cycle duels in the movie “Tron,” complete with music and a score-keeping system. He sketched the beginnings of a “library simulator,” and finished his own arcade game, Dot in Space, about a tiny spaceship travelling at warp speed. Whenever he hit a potentially momentum-killing bump in the road, A.I. enabled us to roll through it. At my request, the systems began pointing us toward more sophisticated coding environments—Construct, GDevelop, Godot Engine, GameMaker—and suggesting more ambitious projects. Last weekend, he stayed up late, programming a polished version of Asteroids while wolfing down Cheerios and gulping from his water bottle as though it were an energy drink.\n\nSince Peter is a kid, and I’m a dad, all this can seem cute and quaint. Isn’t it nice that A.I. can help a young person learn to code, and an older one become a coding tutor? But consider what’s happening from a different perspective. In “The Wealth of Nations,” Adam Smith described the “acquired and useful abilities” of a worker as a kind of “fixed capital”—something akin to a hunk of real estate or piece of equipment. It wasn’t until the nineteen-sixties that an economist named Theodore Schultz coined the term “human capital” to describe the ongoing, dynamic process through which people invest in improving themselves. Schultz realized that individuals spend a lot of time, money, and effort becoming more capable. They go to night school, network, read self-help books, and tend to use their free time “to improve skills and knowledge.” The work of improving human capital often happens out of sight. But the “simple truth,” he argued, was “that people invest in themselves and that these investments are very large.” Schultz suggested that these investments, which improve “the quality of human effort,” might account “for most of the impressive rise in the real earnings per worker” that economists had observed in the preceding decades.\n\nToday, it’s obvious that companies and organizations benefit greatly from people with lots of human capital. Meetings are more useful when they involve knowledgeable participants; a product improves when the team building it possesses a wide range of skills. What’s less obvious is that companies and organizations simultaneously struggle to recognize and take advantage of changes in human capital. Suppose someone is hired to do one job, and then acquires skills that qualify her for another. Ideally, the organizational chart would shift around her as she becomes more capable; in practice, the job is often a prison. And when a worker breaks out of that prison, by getting a job elsewhere, she takes her human capital with her. For this reason, from the perspective of the company, it’s almost as though the ideal hire is someone who works feverishly to build up their human capital until their first day of work, and then suddenly slows down, becoming a highly skilled cog in the machine. Organizations want their workers to continue improving themselves—but not too fast, lest they outgrow the systems in which they’re enmeshed.",

The move, which aligns with what rivals Google and OpenAI do with their models, would mark the biggest departure to date from the open-source strategy Meta has touted for years. Open-source models allow outside developers and researchers to review and build upon the code. Meta’s new Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang is an advocate of closed models, according to the people.",

    "description": "AI is reshaping the CHRO role, requiring HR leaders to become AI strategists and bridge people, technology, and data in today's workforce.",
    "fullText": "AI is changing how companies hire, train, and lead, and in the process, the chief human resources officer's role is expanding.\n\nToday's top HR leaders are becoming AI strategists, helping their organizations navigate the next wave of workplace transformation.\n\n\"The old model of HR was employees over here, technology over there,\" says Thomas Hutzschenreuter, a university professor at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). \"But the new model of work is human-AI collaboration.\"\n\nAI is a coworker now, he says, and that means that \"HR has a bigger mandate. They need to understand not just people and culture, but go deeper into the strategy, the business, and the technology itself.\"\n\nTo understand how companies are navigating the shift, Business Insider spoke with people leaders at Citizens Bank, one of the largest banks in the Northeast; Boston Consulting Group, a global consultancy; and UiPath, an automation software testing company.\n\nAll interviews have been edited for brevity.\n\nCHROs are becoming the architects of the future of work, bridging people, technology, and data.\n\nThere are many questions we are in the middle of that are germane to how we as an organization move forward, such as: What's going to happen to entry-level roles? What roles are emerging? And how do we reskill people in a way that prepares them to make shifts thoughtfully?\n\nWe need people who can quickly learn, adapt, and change. Our technologists need to develop their business acumen, and our business folks need to develop their digital and technical fluency. The lines are blurring.\n\nMy HR team is developing a baseline of skills and capabilities. We're having conversations with consulting partners and clients. There's an openness to communal learning because everyone is trying to figure out the same things: what the AI-driven workforce will look like, how to break work into tasks for AI vs. humans, and what AI agents can handle versus humans.\n\nWe're subject to a lot of regulatory oversight in our industry. It's great that people can develop their own AI agents — there's a push to decentralize these capabilities — but we need to be mindful of risk and governance and how we do this in a safe, ethical way.\n\nAI is changing how work gets done and what work gets done. Business models are evolving, and the way companies serve clients is shifting. The CHRO role now requires adapting to both at once. It's a tall order.\n\nIn consulting, our ability to add value means constantly evolving our approach to human capital. The issues are constant; the pace is what's different. Today, a quarter of our business involves AI, which wasn't true even two years ago.\n\nWe need our people to be AI fluent. About 90% of our workforce uses AI regularly, and more than half use it daily. To get there, we've built a multi-layered support system: a 1,400-person enablement network acting as evangelists and coaches.\n\nWe've upskilled more than 100 team coaches to provide hands-on support. We deploy experts directly into teams to help them reimagine workflows and run innovation competitions to keep momentum going.\n\nOur HR team has taken the lead. We started with recruiting — consolidating six IT systems into one and integrating AI throughout the platform and across performance management and development.\n\nWe're also experimenting with voice tools, chat interfaces, and AI avatars for real-time coaching. These tools give employees confidence, learning opportunities, and instant feedback. They don't replace managers — they free them up for higher-level thinking and relationship-building.\n\nOur business is automation, so that muscle is very strong for my team. But the next frontier of agentic AI is an adjustment.\n\nWe're using these AI agents — but we're also creating them. One agent, almost in production, helps with performance reviews, which is a time-consuming and sometimes dreaded task. Our agent helps employees write their self-assessment and collects feedback, bringing it together much quicker. It also helps managers by consolidating feedback from multiple resources.\n\nIt won't make rating decisions on the manager's behalf, but it makes the year-end much more seamless. Instead of spending time on admin, managers can focus on the feedback itself and my team on the right framework for career development.\n\nThere are a lot of unknowns at the moment, and fear is natural. But it should fuel curiosity and development. This is the time to think about career development seriously.\n\nWe have this idea that AI is only affecting entry-level or lower-level jobs. The truth is that technology is replacing skills that very highly skilled people have been doing.\n\nIf you look at the medical field and aviation — areas where we always thought technology wouldn't touch — that's no longer the case. It's not going to happen overnight. We have time to prepare. But it's relevant for everybody in any profession.",

    "description": "AI disrupts ARR: Startups and SaaS firms face new hybrid valuation models as investors prioritize usage, efficiency, and outcome-based metrics.",
    "fullText": "Startups and other tech companies love to boast about \"annual recurring revenue.\" AI could make this metric obsolete, though.\n\nAccording to a new report by consultant AlixPartners, investors are on the cusp of abandoning the traditional ARR-multiple playbook that defined the SaaS era. In its place will emerge hybrid valuation models that reward companies not for the size of their subscription base but for how effectively they use AI to elevate customer outcomes.\n\nFor decades, ARR served as the bedrock for valuing enterprise software firms. It measures revenue from subscriptions by taking the value of current contracts and extrapolating that out over a full year.\n\nAlixPartners now argues that ARR is becoming increasingly \"meaningless\" in an AI-first economy, especially as usage- and outcome-based business models replace the per-seat licenses that have dominated the SaaS industry.\n\nThe big change is related to how expensive AI models are to run. Every time a new AI software service taps into this intelligence, the provider has to pay a per-token price. That makes fixed, per-seat SaaS subscriptions tougher to offer.\n\nThis means revenue could fluctuate \n\nAlixPartners says investors are already shifting focus toward a hybrid valuation approach in the AI era:\n\n• AI leverage ratios — These measure how effectively companies convert AI investments into revenue and margin gains. Rather than rewarding scale for its own sake, investors will reward operational efficiency and automation-driven profitability.\n\n• Outcome-based performance benchmarks — Metrics such as customer margin expansion, reduced task completion time, or increased throughput will matter more than raw seat-based user counts.\n\n• Traditional ARR multiples — Still relevant but no longer sufficient on their own.\n\nNew forecasting metrics, such as \"time to usage,\" \"usage ramp rate,\" and \"usage volatility,\" are emerging to help investors gauge how quickly customers adopt AI features and how stable their consumption patterns are over time.\n\nThe message is clear: In the AI era, value follows impact. Companies that can demonstrate real productivity gains for customers and operational leverage for themselves will earn premium valuations. Those clinging to legacy ARR-driven models risk being left behind as investors pivot to frameworks that better capture the economics of intelligent software.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Disney CEO Bob Iger said the company's licensing deal with OpenAI will let it capitalize on a fast-growing technology and engage younger audiences.",
    "fullText": "Disney CEO Bob Iger says his company's major licensing deal with OpenAI is all about establishing a foothold in a new realm of entertainment and engaging younger audiences.\n\nThe licensing agreement gives ChatGPT and OpenAI's Sora video platform access to Disney characters like Mickey Mouse and Darth Vader. Disney is also investing $1 billion in the AI company and becoming a \"major customer.\"\n\nSpeaking on CNBC about the deal with OpenAI's Sam Altman on Thursday, Iger said it gives Disney a chance to get in on a fast-growing area of tech.\n\n\"It gives us an opportunity, really, to play a part in what is really a breathtaking, breathtaking growth in essentially AI and new forms of media and entertainment,\" Iger said.\n\nIger said the deal also fulfills a longtime desire by Disney to put user-generated content on its Disney+ streaming platform. Disney initially plans to put select videos created on Sora onto Disney+ to increase engagement with users, especially younger ones. Ultimately, Iger wants to let Disney+ users create such videos within the platform itself.\n\n\"That's a big step for us,\" he said.\n\nDisney has long been highly protective of its famous characters and storylines, and Iger is widely seen in Hollywood as a champion of the creative set. But like other entertainment players, Disney has an engagement problem. The time people spend on streaming has stayed essentially flat over the past few years, despite increased spending on content. Social media and user-generated content, in contrast, continue to rise. The bet with OpenAI is that the deal can get people to spend more time on Disney platforms by giving them new ways to play around with its famous franchises.\n\nIger has long positioned the company as pro-technology, and he said, in reference to the OpenAI deal, that he'd rather participate in technological innovation than be disrupted by it.\n\n\"We think this is actually a way for us to be part of these developments, as opposed to being harmed by them,\" he said.\n\nIger said the deal is also a way for Disney to participate in the big rise in user-generated short-form video on social-media platforms.\n\nAltman said Thursday that the demand for Disney characters, in particular, is \"off the charts\" on OpenAI's products. He said he sees the deal enabling people to do things like putting themselves in a lightsaber scene from \"Star Wars\" or creating a custom birthday video for their kid using the Buzz Lightyear character.\n\nAI firms have been \"frenemies\" to media companies, as many in Hollywood are concerned about how they use copyrighted material and the threat that they could pose to the creative process. Iger said the OpenAI deal is good for creators rather than a threat.\n\n\"This does not in any way represent a threat to the creators at all. In fact, the opposite,\" Iger said. \"I think it honors them and respects them, in part because there's a license to be associated with it.\"\n\nDisney said the agreement does not include any talent likeness or voices and that OpenAI would have guardrails in place to make sure Disney's IP was used in a safe way.\n\nIn June, Disney, along with Comcast's NBCUniversal studio business, sued AI company Midjourney, claiming its tech created unauthorized copies of works ranging from Star Wars to The Simpsons. Midjourney denied the claims in its legal response. That suit is ongoing.",

    "description": "Archaeologists have found the earliest evidence yet of fire technology — and it was created by Neanderthals in England more than 400,000 years ago.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nNeanderthals were the world's first innovators of fire technology, tiny specks of evidence in England suggest. Flecks of pyrite found at a more than 400,000-year-old archaeological site in Suffolk, in eastern England, push back archaeologists' evidence for controlled fire-making and suggest that key human brain developments began far earlier than previously thought.\n\n\"We're a species who've used fire to really shape the world around us,\" study co-author Rob Davis, a Paleolithic archaeologist at the British Museum, said in a news conference on Tuesday (Dec. 9). \"The ability to make fire would have been critically important\" in human evolution, Davis said, \"accelerating evolutionary trends\" such as developing larger brains, maintaining larger social groups, and increasing language skills.\n\nSince 2013, Davis and colleagues have been excavating an archaeological site in England called Barnham, which yielded stone tools, burnt sediment and charcoal from 400,000 years ago. In a study published Wednesday (Dec. 10) in the journal Nature, the researchers revealed that the site contained the world's earliest direct evidence of fire-making — and that this fire technology was likely pioneered by Neanderthals.\n\nBarnham was first recognized as a Paleolithic human site in the early 1900s due to the presence of stone tools. But recent excavations uncovered evidence of ancient human groups occupying the area more than 415,000 years ago, when Barnham was a small, seasonal watering hole in a woodland depression.\n\nIn one corner of the site, archaeologists found a concentration of heat-shattered hand axes as well as a zone of reddened clay. Through a series of scientific analyses, the researchers discovered that the reddened clay had been subjected to repeated, localized burning, which suggested the area may have been an ancient hearth.\n\n\"The big turning point came with the discovery of iron pyrite,\" study co-author Nick Ashton, curator of Paleolithic collections at the British Museum, said in the news conference.\n\nPyrite, also known as fool's gold, is a naturally occurring mineral that can produce sparks when struck against flint. While pyrite is found in many locations around the world, it is extremely rare in the Barnham area, meaning someone specifically brought pyrite to the site, probably with the aim of making fire, the researchers said in the study.\n\nBecause of the importance of controlled fire, paleoanthropologists have long debated the timing of this invention.\n\n\"There are so many obvious advantages to fire, from cooking to protection from predators to its technological use in creating new types of artifacts to its ability to bring people together,\" April Nowell, a Paleolithic archaeologist at the University of Victoria in Canada who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. \"We only have to think of our own childhoods gathering around a campfire to understand its emotional resonance.\"\n\nResearchers believe that early humans first used wildfires for cooking food. This was a crucial step in human evolution because cooking widened the range of food available and made it more digestible, which in turn provided more nutrients needed to grow a larger brain, Davis said.\n\nBut there is limited evidence for deliberate early fire technology, and that evidence is often ambiguous, the researchers noted in the study.\n\nFor example, scientists unearthed reddened sediment at Koobi Fora in Kenya that dated to about 1.5 million years ago. Researchers suggested it could hint at early fire use because the key hominin at the site — Homo erectus — had a fairly large brain. And at two sites in Israel dated to about 800,000 years ago, burnt animal bones and stone tools suggest possible control of fire by the human ancestors who lived there.\n\nFire technology then exploded around 400,000 years ago. Archaeologists have found evidence of burning at cave sites in France, Portugal, Spain, Ukraine and the U.K., and then more widespread use of fire in Europe, Africa and the Levant (the region around the east Mediterranean) by 200,000 years ago.\n\nBut these previous examples do not show the same kind of conclusive geochemical evidence of fire making that was found at Barnham, Ashton argued. He called the team's careful analysis of the Barnham sediment and identification of pyrite \"the most exciting discovery in my 40-year career.\"\n\nHowever, any bones at Barnham have since disintegrated, so the \"smoking gun\" of butchered and burned animal bones that could prove the site was used for cooking has not been found.\n\nThis also means there are no skeletal remains of the fire producers themselves at Barnham — but study co-author Chris Stringer, a paleoanthropologist at the National History Museum in London, has a guess about their identity.\n\n\"We assume that the fires at Barnham were being made by early Neanderthals,\" Stringer said in the news conference, based on a nearby site called Swanscombe, where Neanderthal skull bones were discovered that dated to the same time period as Barnham.\n\nWhile experts have known for about a decade that some Neanderthals could make fire, that evidence goes back only 50,000 years. The Barnham finds push that date 350,000 years further back, suggesting Neanderthals were much smarter than most people give them credit for.\n\nNeanderthals \"are fully human,\" Stringer said. \"They have complex behavior, they're adapting to new environments, and their brains are as large as ours. They're very evolved humans.\"\n\nNowell said that the study's results add fuel to a larger debate about Neanderthals' control of fire and their social and cultural use of it.\n\n\"There is a lot of discussion right now about whether all Neanderthals made fire or if it is only some Neanderthals at some times and places that made fire,\" Nowell said. The new study \"is another important data point in our understanding of Neanderthal pyrotechnical capabilities with all that implies cognitively, socially and technologically.\"\n\nIf the researchers are correct that Neanderthals made fire from flint and pyrite more than 400,000 years ago in England, this raises additional questions, Nowell said.\n\n—Neanderthals could be brought back within 20 years — but is it a good idea?\n\n—Neanderthals cannibalized 'outsider' women and children 45,000 years ago at cave in Belgium\n\n—'Perfectly preserved' Neanderthal skull bones suggest their noses didn't evolve to warm air\n\n\"Despite its obvious advantages, questions remain about the nature of early fire use: When did fire use become a regular part of the human behavioral repertoire? Were early humans dependent on the opportunistic use of wildfires and lightning strikes? Was fire rediscovered multiple times?\" Nowell said.\n\nThe ancestors of Homo sapiens were living in Africa 400,000 years ago and not likely interacting with early Neanderthals half a world away.\n\n\"We don't know if Homo sapiens at that date had the ability to make fire,\" Stringer said, because to date there is no clear evidence for control of fire any earlier than Barnham.\n\nThis means that Neanderthals may have invented ways to make and control fire somewhere in continental Europe, which then enabled our human cousins to move further north into England, heating and lighting their way with fire.\n\n\"It's plausible that fire became more controlled in Europe and spread to Africa,\" Ashton said. \"We have to keep an open mind.\"",

    "description": "Companies are pouring money into AI but failing to translate that investment into workforce capability, largely because traditional training methods don’t help employees retain or apply complex skills. Extended reality—virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality—bridges this gap by letting people learn through immersive, emotionally engaging, hands-on experiences that the brain encodes like real events. Organizations from Bank of America to Boeing to Walmart are already seeing faster learning, higher confidence, reduced errors, and lower costs by using XR to train employees in everything from customer-service scenarios to technical assembly. The technology works because it aligns with how people actually learn, benefits from major improvements in affordability and accessibility, and meets the expectations of a workforce already accustomed to immersive digital environments. The companies that start with focused pilot projects, match the right XR tool to the right skill gaps, and scale deliberately will build training systems that actually change behavior and materially improve performance.",

    "description": "Export-controlled technology worth US$30 million with fake brand labels was allegedly addressed to a facility near Toronto’s Pearson airport",
    "fullText": "A Chinese-born Canadian citizen who lives in Mississauga, Ont., was arrested in Virginia by the FBI and charged with trying to smuggle restricted high-tech Nvidia computer chips used in AI processing to China\n\nU.S. authorities seized export-controlled technology worth about $30 million that was addressed to an air freight facility in Mississauga, close to Toronto Pearson International Airport, according to allegations filed in court.\n\nNvidia labels on the components had been removed and replaced with labels for a fake company, authorities said.\n\nThe arrest of Benlin Yuan, of Mississauga, immediately west of Toronto, and the large shipment destined for Toronto are part of Operation Gatekeeper, described by U.S. authorities as targeting “a sophisticated illicit procurement conspiracy and smuggling network that orchestrates buying and exporting controlled high-tech computer chips to China.”\n\nYuan is described in U.S. prosecution documents as president of an information technology company based in Virginia that provides data centre services and IT support and consulting in Canada and the United States. The documents say it is a subsidiary of a Chinese company based in Beijing.\n\nHe was arrested in Sterling, Virginia, on Nov. 28 and charged with conspiring to violate export control acts.\n\nThe network is accused of purchasing at least US$50 million worth of GPUs from a large U.S. technology company.\n\nThe computer products Yuan is alleged to be involved in exporting are Nvidia A100, H100, and H200 Tensor Core graphic processing units, known as GPUs, and HGX baseboards. The equipment is used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications and in high-performance computing. The chips can handle huge amounts of data that is needed in AI applications, an exploding field that is revolutionizing technology.\n\nThe GPUs can perform calculations at higher speeds than most previous computers.\n\nSince about November 2023, a Chinese company has worked to import these chips from the United States, prosecutors allege. The entire plot is alleged to have involved US$160 million in tech goods.\n\nYuan is accused of joining the conspiracy this spring.\n\nIn a criminal complaint sworn by a special agent in the U.S. Department of Commerce, Yuan helped buy the technology using straw purchasers and intermediaries, meaning in the name of a person or company that is not the real end buyer.\n\nThe buyers allegedly declared the goods were for use by customers within the United States or in countries that do not require an export licence, including Taiwan and Thailand.\n\nAt various U.S. warehouses, Nvidia labels were allegedly removed from the computer circuits and relabeled with a fake manufacturing brand of SANDKYAN, according to the criminal complaint against Yuan.\n\nWhen preparing the items for export, the shipping paperwork misclassified the products as harmless and unrestricted pieces of tech: “adapters,” “adapter modules,” and “computer controllers,” authorities claim.\n\nThey were then shipped, directly or indirectly, to China.\n\nInvestigators received a tip about pallets of suspicious GPUs at a New Jersey warehouse that were addressed to companies in China.\n\nAn undercover agent was sent inside, where he spent an hour.\n\nThe agent allegedly saw two engineers who appeared to be of Chinese origin unboxing Nvidia components. One of the engineers spoke to the undercover agent in Mandarin, documents say. The engineers said they had to cover up all of the Nvidia branding on the equipment for “export purposes,” court filings allege.\n\nThe agent watched Nvidia labels being pulled off and new ones for the fake firm put in their place. The next day the agent returned and found the boxes had been resealed. The products were now labeled as having been “Made in Taiwan.”\n\nNot only were those packages addressed for shipping to Toronto, but warehouse employees told agents they recently had several similar tech exports to Canada.\n\nThe packages were removed and secured in a government warehouse. That sparked a flow of complaint calls and demand letters about the missing GPUs. The people expecting the goods believed the undercover officer had stolen the products and started negotiating to have them returned, authorities allege.\n\nThey offered $1 million to get their packages back, but insisted the equipment be inspected before payment was made.\n\nYuan is accused of organizing the “inspection.”\n\nHe is accused of recruiting and arranging the group of inspectors and of being one of the six who arrived to examine the packages, about two weeks after the seizure, court filings allege.\n\nThe inspection arrangements were allegedly planned in a group chat using an encrypted communication app and confirmed later over a video conferencing app.\n\nYuan was told by a high-level representative of the buyer in China to make sure no one said the items were destined for China, according to the criminal complaint. He is accused of helping them develop an elaborate “compliance backstory” to justify the products based on false information.\n\nThey also allegedly discussed how to make the million-dollar payment and Yuan was told to send copies of the driver’s licences of everyone on the inspection team. Three trucks were arranged for the pick up.\n\nHe is also accused of handling the storage of a different shipment of Nvidia products destined for China. A cooperating witness for U.S. prosecutors alleged that Yuan told him not to put fake labels on this one as he thought they looked suspicious; he would rather the Nvidia labels just be removed.\n\nAlexander Blanchard, a Virginia-based lawyer for Yuan, declined to comment about Yuan or the case when asked by National Post.\n\n“Operation Gatekeeper has exposed a sophisticated smuggling network that threatens our nation’s security by funneling cutting-edge AI technology to those who would use it against American interests,” said Nicholas Ganjei, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas.\n\n“These chips are the building blocks of AI superiority and are integral to modern military applications. The country that controls these chips will control AI technology; the country that controls AI technology will control the future.”\n\nU.S. regulation restricts the export of items that could make a significant contribution to the military potential of other nations or could be detrimental to the foreign policy or national security of the United States.\n\nAdvanced computing integrated circuits, including certain Nvidia-manufactured GPUs were added to the export restriction list in 2022. Some of the latest Nvidia chips have been classed by the U.S. as “critical technologies” that China could use to “modernize its military capabilities in ways that threaten the national security interests of the United States and its allies,” according to export regulations.\n\nThe chips require a special licence to export to China.\n\nOn Monday, the same day Operation Gatekeeper was announced, U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States will allow Nvidia’s H200 processors to be exported to China with a 25 per cent fee.\n\nAlan Hao Hsu, also known as Haochun Hsu, 43, of Missouri City, Texas, and his company both pleaded guilty to smuggling and unlawful export activities in October as part of Operation Gatekeeper.\n\nNewly unsealed court documents say Hsu received more than US$50 million in wire transfers from China to help fund the scheme. He is scheduled for sentencing in February.\n\nFanyue Gong, also known as Tom Gong, 43, a citizen of China who lives in Brooklyn, New York, was also charged in the probe. He is described as the owner of a New York technology company. He was arrested in New York on Dec. 3, and charged with conspiring to smuggle goods out of the United States.\n\nFive unnamed co-conspirators are linked to IT companies based in Hong Kong or Shenzhen, a city on the Pearl River that acts as a bridge between Hong Kong and mainland China.\n\n• Email: ahumphreys@postmedia.com | X: AD_Humphreys\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Campaign urges PM to show independence from US and push to rein in development of superintelligence\n\nMore than 100 UK parliamentarians are calling on the government to introduce binding regulations on the most powerful AI systems as concern grows that ministers are moving too slowly to create safeguards in the face of lobbying from the technology industry.\n\nA former AI minister and defence secretary are part of a cross-party group of Westminster MPs, peers and elected members of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish legislatures demanding stricter controls on frontier systems, citing fears superintelligent AI “would compromise national and global security”.\n\nThe push for tougher regulation is being coordinated by a nonprofit organisation called Control AI whose backers include the co-founder of Skype, Jaan Tallinn. It is calling on Keir Starmer to show independence from Donald Trump’s White House, which opposes the regulation of AI. One of the “godfathers” of the technology, Yoshua Bengio, recently said it was less regulated than a sandwich.\n\nThe campaigners include the Labour peer and former defence secretary Des Browne, who said superintelligent AI “would be the most perilous technological development since we gained the ability to wage nuclear war”. He said only international cooperation “can prevent a reckless race for advantage that could imperil us all”.\n\nThe Conservative peer and former environment minister Zac Goldsmith said that “even while very significant and senior figures in AI are blowing the whistle, governments are miles behind the AI companies and are leaving them to pursue its development with virtually no regulation”.\n\nBritain hosted an AI safety summit at Bletchley Park in 2023, which concluded there was “potential for serious, even catastrophic, harm, either deliberate or unintentional” from the most advanced AI systems. It set up the AI Safety Institute, now called the AI Security Institute, which has become an internationally respected body. Less emphasis, however, has been placed on the summit’s call to address risks through international cooperation.\n\nGoldsmith said the UK should “resume its global leadership on AI security by championing an international agreement to prohibit the development of superintelligence until we know what we are dealing with and how to contain it”.\n\nThe calls for state intervention in the AI race come after one of Silicon Valley’s leading AI scientists told the Guardian humanity would have to decide by 2030 whether to take the “ultimate risk” of letting AI systems train themselves to become more powerful. Jared Kaplan, the co-founder and chief scientist at frontier AI company Anthropic, said: “We don’t really want it to be a Sputnik-like situation where the government suddenly wakes up and is like: Oh, wow, AI is a big deal.”\n\nLabour’s programme set out in July 2024 said it would legislate “to place requirements on those working to develop the most powerful artificial intelligence models”. But no bill has been published and the government has faced White House pressure not to inhibit commercial AI development, mostly pioneered by US firms.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said: “AI is already regulated in the UK, with a range of existing rules already in place. We have been clear on the need to ensure the UK and its laws are ready for the challenges and opportunities AI will bring and that position has not changed.”\n\nThe bishop of Oxford, Steven Croft, who is backing the Control AI campaign, called for an independent AI watchdog to scrutinise public sector use and for AI companies to be required to meet minimum testing standards before releasing new models.\n\n“There are all kinds of risks and the government doesn’t seem to have adopted a precautionary principle,” he said. “At the moment there are significant risks: the mental health of children and adults, the environmental costs and other big risks in terms of the alignment of generalised AI and [the question of] what is good for humanity. The government seems to be moving away from regulation.”\n\nThe UK’s first AI minister under Rishi Sunak, Jonathan Berry, said the time was coming when binding regulations should be applied to models that present existential risks. He said rules should be global and would create tripwires so if AI models reached a certain power their makers would have to show they had been tested, designed with off switches and were capable of being retrained.\n\n“International frontier AI safety has not gone on in leaps and bounds as we had hoped,” he said. He cited recent cases of chatbots being involved in encouraging suicides, people using them as therapists and believing they are gods. “The risks, now, are very serious and we need to be constantly on our guard,” he said.\n\nThe chief executive of Control AI, Andrea Miotti, criticised the current “timid approach” and said: “There has been a lot of lobbying from the UK and US. AI companies are lobbying governments in the UK and US to stall regulation arguing it is premature and would crush innovation. Some of these are the same companies who say AIs could destroy humanity.”\n\nHe said the speed with which AI technology was advancing meant mandatory standards could be needed in the next one or two years.",
