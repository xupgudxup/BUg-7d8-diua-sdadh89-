    "fullText": "Newly released documents detail convicted sex offender’s early backing of bitcoin and Coinbase\n\nMillions of files related to Jeffrey Epstein have brought to light his ties to the highest echelons of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nDocuments published last week by the US Department of Justice reveal Epstein bankrolled the “principal home and funding source” for bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, during its nascent stages; he also invested $3m in Coinbase in 2014, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, and cut a check that same year to Blockstream, a prominent bitcoin-focused technology firm. Both crypto startups accepted Epstein’s investments in 2014 – six years after his 2008 conviction in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor.\n\nDespite murmurings among crypto communities online about the need for a sector-level reckoning around the Epstein files’ revelations, most industry players predict few consequences for crypto companies or the sector writ large. Some see Epstein as a “skeptical investor” who pulled out of his crypto investments prematurely; others go so far as to claim Epstein was attempting to “undermine bitcoin”.\n\nThe crypto companies that secured Epstein’s investment have grown into multibillion-dollar giants, especially Coinbase, which went public on the Nasdaq in 2021, and whose co-founder, Brian Armstrong, has heavily influenced crypto regulation in the United States.\n\nEpstein’s 2014 investment in Coinbase was brokered by the crypto evangelist Brock Pierce, a former child actor and a co-founder of Tether, the world’s largest issuer of stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency whose value is typically pegged to a national currency.\n\nDocuments published by the justice department reveal Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of Coinbase who spearheaded its fundraise, liaised with Pierce about Epstein’s investment in the company and sought to meet with Epstein “if convenient”. Additional filings suggest Epstein sold half of his shares to Pierce’s firm, Blockchain Capital, for $15m in 2018.\n\nA spokeswoman for Coinbase declined to comment; Pierce did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nEpstein’s financing of bitcoin’s development stemmed from his role as a donor to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Over the course of 20 years, MIT accepted more than $800,000 from Epstein, who also facilitated more than $7m in donations from other wealthy individuals.\n\nIn communications from 2015 between Joichi Ito, then director of MIT’s Media Lab, a tech-focused research institute, and Epstein, Ito wrote that Epstein’s “gift funds” were used to “underwrite” the launch of the Digital Currency Initiative, an offshoot of the Lab tasked with researching and developing open-source crypto technologies; in the same email thread, Ito explained that the Lab’s role was to serve as the “principal home and funding source” for bitcoin. The Digital Currency Initiative did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn 2014, Ito brokered Epstein’s investment in Blockstream, which builds bitcoin-focused tech solutions. Epstein made a $500,000 early-stage investment in the company through an investment fund he co-owned with Ito. Email communications reveal Blockstream’s co-founders, Adam Back and Austin Hill, were invited by Epstein to meet in St Thomas, close to Little Saint James, the private island Epstein owned.\n\nOn Twitter, Back claimed that Blockstream understood Epstein to be a “limited partner in Ito’s fund”, which later divested from Blockstream “due to a potential conflict of interest, and other concerns” – meaning that “Blockstream has no direct nor indirect financial connection with Jeffrey Epstein, or his estate”.\n\nIn communications with an Italian investor, Epstein noted that he “like[d]” Back. Hill continued communicating with Epstein into 2017, checking in with his “friend” following a storm in the Caribbean. “Just checking that your Island is OK,” reads the email thread’s subject line. Representatives for Blockstream and Hill did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLuke Dashjr, an early contributor to bitcoin’s development as well as to Blockstream, has called for Adam Back to resign from his role as Blockstream’s CEO over ties to Epstein. In an interview with the Guardian, Dashjr said Epstein’s interest in bitcoin – namely, his “attempts to undermine” bitcoin’s network, early-stage companies, and developers – was a sign that “evil men often seek to destroy what is good”.\n\nCharlotte Fang, the founder of Remilia, which makes NFTs and other crypto-based art, said “only unserious people might care” about Epstein’s investment in bitcoin and Coinbase; in the latter case, “only the financially unsophisticated” would assume that he had “any degree of influence over the direction” of the exchange, as his seven-figure investment was a small part of Coinbase’s fundraise.\n\n“Bitcoin is a decentralized technology that required no funding, and Epstein was evidently a skeptical investor, who got in later than I did, and exited earlier than he should have,” Fang said.\n\n“Generally speaking, retail consumers will not change their habits” around crypto following this recent release of Epstein files, according to Kadan Stadelmann of Komodo, a crypto platform. Investor practices, including their dependence on connections to cut checks, will probably adhere to the status quo, he added. Some competitor crypto exchanges might see new customers who are leaving Coinbase following these new allegations, he hypothesized – as long as these exchanges didn’t take money from “similar unsavory sources”.\n\nAs to why Epstein was so interested in crypto, and in Coinbase specifically? “Epstein might have liked Coinbase’s IPO prospects,” he surmised.\n\nCryptocurrencies’ technological capabilities may have also played a role in Epstein’s interest in the sector, said Antulio Rosales, a professor at York University who studies crypto.\n\n“There’s his possibility of seeing markets without any ethical commitments, and without any pressures of social norms and of the law itself,” he said.",

    "description": "OpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger said specialized AI, not AGI or LLMs, is a better future for the technology.",
    "fullText": "In Silicon Valley, many investors, founders, and tech giants often frame AI as an all-powerful force — something approaching omniscience.\n\nThey call it artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a hypothetical system capable of matching or exceeding human reasoning across virtually all tasks and, beyond that, superintelligence, which would surpass human cognition altogether.\n\nAGI is the thing OpenAI and its competitors are racing to be the first to bring to life.\n\nThe industry isn't a monolith, however, nor are its builders.\n\nPeter Steinberger, the creator of OpenClaw, the now-viral personal AI assistant powering the agent-only social network, Moltbook, told the Y Combinator podcast on Saturday that he thinks the best AI is specialized, not generalized.\n\n\"What can one human being actually achieve? Do you think one human being could make an iPhone or one human being could go to space?\" he said. \"As a group we specialize, as a larger society we specialize even more.\"\n\nHe said the same holds true for AI. Current AI systems are labeled as \"general.\" In practice, however, they are already specialized for particular tasks — like startups building models to solve Erdos math problems or identify gene mutations.\n\nWhile the hype around AI has largely focused on the types of models being built — from large language models to computer vision systems or even world models — some startups and tech giants are also experimenting with more focused, subject-specific forms of intelligence.\n\nAxiom, a startup founded by former Meta researcher Carina Hong and backed by $64 million in seed funding, for instance, is building specialized intelligence to tackle advanced mathematics.\n\nGoogle DeepMind has developed AlphaGenome, a system designed to predict how variants or mutations in human DNA affect a wide range of gene-regulating biological processes.\n\nCompanies are also developing smaller models, which could make it easier to build AI systems tailored to specific subjects or domains. Aidan Gomez, the CEO of Cohere, which builds AI technology for enterprises, told Business Insider in 2024 that there was increasing pressure to build \"smaller, more efficient models\" and to make them smarter with the right data and algorithms, rather than just scaling them.\n\nSteinberger is not the only one to push back against the idea of an all-powerful general intelligence.\n\nTimnit Gebru, a computer scientist who founded and leads the Distributed AI Research Institute, said AGI is a \"fictional thing\" in a November video published by Nature.\n\nShe said the backbone of engineering lies in building well-scoped, testable systems. The pursuit of a \"fictional, undefined 'machine god,'\" she said, is pushing the industry toward deeper labor exploitation and environmental damage.\n\nSteinberger, previously best known for launching the PDF processing company PSPDFKit, came out of retirement to build with AI. He said the technology has come a long way since he started, when his goal was simply to build \"something that could type stuff so my computer could do things.\"",

    "fullText": "Authors, a newsreader, a lawyer and an esteemed colleague: they’re all great – but I’m not married to any of them. Can we really depend on this technology?\n\nRecently, the Rowsons accidentally invented a new game that anyone can play at home. I have yet to come up with a world-beating name for it, so for now let’s just call it “How bloody stupid is AI?” The playing of the game will change from player to player, depending on their circumstances – but essentially the rules remain the same. Ask AI a simple question about yourself, and see just how wrong it gets it.\n\nIn my case, all you need know is that while I, through the nature of my job, have a fairly large online presence, my partner (we married in 1987) has assiduously avoided having one at all. Which means that if you Google “Martin Rowson wife” in images, you may get a picture of me next to our then 14-year-old daughter or me with my friend and fellow cartoonist Steven Appleby, who happens to be trans but has kept her given first name.\n\nIt’s probably incredibly reckless of me to say so, but I find this very funny. As a satirist, I have always been a fool for anything that points up the even greater folly of our leaders, the tools of their techbro masters or the true capabilities of our new robot overlords. Anyway, I was explaining all this to our soon-to-be daughter-in-law over Christmas when our children (in their 30s, and therefore much tech-savvier than me) explained that it was much more fun than that, and that I should ask: “Who is Martin Rowson’s wife?”\n\nImagine my delight when the first answer from Google search’s AI overview was “Jeanette Winterson”. (To be clear, I swear on the lives of the entire population of Silicon Valley that the famous lesbian author categorically is not my wife.) But it got better – and here comes the sublime beauty of the mesmeric imbecility of the Tool That Will Transform The World. Each time we repeated the question, the answer changed, then changed again. This seemed dependent on how the question was phrased or punctuated, but who knows? Here is the list of my alleged wives I compiled before I finally got bored:\n\nTextile designer Fiona Scott-Wilson.\n\nActor Fiona Marr, she of Bridgerton.\n\nJulia Mills (though it’s unclear whether this is the fantasy author, the illustrator, the late powerlifter or another Julia Mills altogether).\n\nWriter and journalist Emily Rees.\n\nLawyer and academic Siva Thambisetty, who is married to chess grandmaster Jonathan Rowson. AI also claims Jonathan and I are brothers. We’re not.\n\nWriter and journalist Carrie McLaren.\n\nChannel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman.\n\nCNN correspondent Clarissa Ward.\n\nJournalist and broadcaster Rachel Johnson.\n\nThen it got really weird. La femme Rowson, AI said, is actually “journalist and author Kate Clements Rowson”. Googled that name: none the wiser.\n\nThen it suggested I’m married to “writer/illustrator Helen Grant”. Apparently our son, Leo, is a jazz musician. Again, who is she? Nothing on Google. And Leo, who he? Does he really play jazz? Does he exist?\n\nThere was “former Guardian political editor & current CEO of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation Liz Kerr”. Que? There is no Guardian political editor, past or present, of that name. Liz Kerr nowhere appears on the list of the great and good at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Once again, all wrong. Playwright Lee Hall got a mention. He’s male, so couldn’t be my wife anyway.\n\nAs for “historian and writer Jeanette Winterbottom”. We apparently worked together on “The Guardian Book of Satire” and “The Dog’s Diary”, it says here. Maybe AI confused her with Jeanette Winterson, but then she and I didn’t collaborate on those projects, there is no Guardian Book of Satire, and I have never published a Dog’s Diary (though if someone wants to send me royalties for that, I’d take them).\n\nAnother search, another skipful of gibberish. “He’s been married to writer and journalist Ann Widdecombe (his ex-wife), Cathy Caldwell, and his long-term partner/wife, journalist and author, Polly Toynbee is a frequent figure alongside him in media, suggesting they are a prominent couple in UK literary/journalistic circles.”\n\nFor the record, I have met Rachel Johnson and my own daughter, but am married to neither of them. Again and again the bot failed to identify my real wife, to everyone’s relief, although latterly it’s begun saying: “Her name is not publicly named in the provided search results.”\n\nI suppose this suggests a capacity for learning, but maybe not. I asked “who is my wife?” once more for the purposes of this article, and Google’s AI said I’m married to “Debora Rowson (nee Ffrench)”, a retired civil servant, and ascribed to our wholly fictitious union is my extra daughter, Clementine, yet another writer/journalist. Apparently, I write about our amusing domestic upsets in my imaginary Guardian column.\n\nWhile my mythical marriage to Boris Johnson’s sister is obvious comedy gold (imagine that family Christmas!), for this nonsense to be the fruit of a garlanded, universal research tool used by billions – and for it to be repeatedly, serially wrong – is more than slightly disturbing.\n\nWe should all by now have worked out that AI is about as sentient as an abacus, and only truly mirrors the human mind in its capacity to lie to humans, telling them what it “thinks” they want to hear. It is also a universal truth that the world’s most dangerous people are idiots who think they are really, really clever (just look around and you’ll get the point). Add those two facts together and what on earth do you imagine we will end up with?\n\nI wouldn’t ask AI that, it would probably say “banana bread”, then change its mind to, “Exterminate them all!”\n\nMartin Rowson is a cartoonist and author",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Singapore (AP) — This week’s Singapore Air Show brought together trade delegations from around the world to show off the latest in civilian and military aviation technology.\n\nThe event this year marked the 10th edition of the air show, which showcased cutting-edge planes from the Royal Australian Air Force and the United States Air Force. This included the F-35 Lightning II, the latest U.S.-made fifth-generation fighter jet that has integrated stealth technology and is considered one of the world’s most advanced combat aircraft.\n\nMajor commercial plane makers also touted the latest advancements in their fleets, including Airbus, Bombardier, Gulfstream, Boeing and China’s Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, known as COMAC.\n\n“We have a very good representation of the latest and the greatest,” said Leck Chet Lam, managing director of Experia Events, which organizes the event. “The Singapore Air Show, the unique part of it is we cover both the aviation and also the defense industries.”\n\nDuring the Singapore Air Show's aerial displays, COMAC promoted its C919 passenger jet, which China is pushing as an alternative to the European Airbus A320neo and the American Boeing 737 MAX. The daily aerial displays at the event also showcased six military teams and Airbus’ A350-1000.\n\nWithin the exhibition hall, the air show featured experimental air taxis, advanced flight simulators, a wide variety of drones and both manned and unmanned helicopters. The static aircraft display under Singapore’s sizzling sun included roughly 35 planes from more than 10 countries.\n\nIn all, more than 1,000 companies from around 50 countries participated in the air show, hosted on the grounds of Changi International Airport, Southeast Asia's busiest airport. The event, which opened on Feb. 3, is considered Asia’s largest aerospace and defense exhibition and runs through Feb. 8.\n\n“All the exhibitors can use Singapore as a springboard to then tap into the opportunities that are rising in the Asia-Pacific market, which is a key driver that is driving the growth of the global aviation industry,\" Lam said.\n\nThis is a photo gallery curated by AP photo editors.",

    "fullText": "Technology has dramatically changed the beverage market.\n\n\"About 30% of milk was still delivered to homes in the 1960s,\" according to USDA agricultural surveys, and prior to that, had been the most common way consumers got their milk, Food52 reported.\n\nIt was actually the growth of supermarkets and the prevalence of car ownership that ultimately made the milk man irrelevant.\n\nShipping and storage technology has also changed the beverage market.\n\nJuice concentrates, for example, were created for a logical reason.\n\n\"Frozen concentrated orange juice was invented in Florida in the 1940s, primarily as a way to provide juice for the military, readily storable and easy to ship. But frozen juice has been losing favor for years,\" the Wall Street Journal reported in 2015.\n\nNow, Coca-Cola has dealt another blow to the struggling market for juice concentrates.\n\nNot-from-concentrate orange juice surpassed the concentrated orange-juice market in the 1980s, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing data from Nielsen.\n\nCoca-Cola's Minute Maid brand, however, has continued to make concentrated orange juice and lemonade in a variety of flavors including raspberry lemonade, pink lemonade, and limeade.\n\nThe beverage giant has decided to discontinue Minute Maid’s frozen canned orange juices and lemonades after 80 years as consumer demand declines.\n\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\n\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\n\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\n\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\n\n\"Minute Maid frozen products will be discontinued in North America in the first quarter of 2026, with in-store inventory available when supplies last,\" a Coca-Cola spokesperson told Food Dive.\n\n“With the juice category growing strongly, we’re focusing on products that better match what our consumers want,” the spokesperson said.\n\n\"Juice concentrate is a thick liquid made by removing the water content from fruit juice. This process involves heating the juice to evaporate the water, leaving behind a concentrated form of the juice's flavor and nutrients. It is like making fruit juice more potent by taking out most of the water,\" according to Business Research Insights.\n\nIt can be stored for longer than fresh juice, and while demand has slipped in U.S. homes, it's still used by manufacturers, and the global market is growing.\n\nThe global juice concentrates market is projected to grow from about $83.9 billion in 2025 to nearly $134.1 billion by 2035, reflecting strong long‑term expansion driven by beverage demand worldwide.\n\nIn the broader fruit concentrate segment, the market is valued at roughly $20.95 billion in 2025 and expected to reach around $36.96 billion by 2035, growing at a CAGR of 5.8%.\n\nOther forecasts show the juice concentrates industry growing from about $67.6 billion in 2025 to an estimated $94.6 billion by 2030, with CAGR near 7%, highlighting rising demand for natural and functional beverage ingredients.\n\nNorth America dominates with nearly 35% market share due to strong demand, advanced infrastructure, and abundant agricultural resources.\n\nOrange juice from concentrate was something my parents always had in my childhood home in the 1980s, though I never actually drank it. Back then, it felt like a household staple, even if it didn’t end up in my glass.\n\nSjors Peters, global innovation marketing leader for beverages at IFF, believes that consumer perceptions around taste, naturality, and health have continued to drive demand for Not From Concentrate (NFC) over Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice (FCOJ), Food Ingredients First reported.\n\n“The preference for NFC juice over FCOJ has also been accentuated by the lack of carryover from previous crops. One effect of higher NFC production has been a drastic reduction in the availability of orange essence oil,” he says.\n\nBack in 2020, Coca-Cola slashed its beverage lineup, killing a number of well-known brands including TaB, its original diet soda product. It also killed the Odwalla juice line, and Zico, a coconut water brand.\n\n\"Reducing the portfolio will allow Coca-Cola to focus on its most profitable offerings, the company explained. Those include its core products like Coca-Cola Zero Sugar as well as brands that fit into trendy new categories, like Topo Chico hard seltzer and AHA, a caffeinated seltzer the company launched last year,\" CNN Business reported at the time.\n\nDuring that culling, Coca-Cola stopped making approximately 200 different beverages. The company explained the decision at the time.\n\n\"The company continues to pursue its beverages for life ambition by calibrating a portfolio with an optimal set of global, regional and local brands with the strongest potential to grow their consumer bases, increase frequency and drive system margins. The company expects to offer a portfolio of approximately 200 master brands, an approximate 50% reduction from the current number,\" it shared in a press release.\n\nSince then, Coca-Cola has not had a widespread purge of brands, but it has made regular cuts when a product or product line did not meet performance expectations.",

    "fullText": "A CORUNA, Spain, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Around a third of countries attending a military AI summit agreed on Thursday to a a declaration ​on how to govern deployment of the technology in warfare, but military ‌heavyweights China and the U.S. opted out.\n\nTensions in relations between the United States and European allies, and uncertainty ‌over how transatlantic ties will look in coming months and years, made some countries hesitant to sign joint agreements, several attendees and delegates said.\n\nThe pledge underscores growing concern among some governments that rapid advances in artificial intelligence could outpace rules around its military use, raising the ⁠risk of accidents, miscalculation or ‌unintended escalation.\n\nGovernments are facing a \"prisoner's dilemma\", caught between putting responsible restrictions in place and not wanting to limit themselves in comparison with adversaries, ‍said Dutch Defence Minister Ruben Brekelmans.\n\n\"Russia and China are moving very fast. That creates urgency to make progress in developing AI. But seeing it going fast also increases the urgency to keep ​working on its responsible use. The two go hand-in-hand,\" he said in comments to ‌Reuters.\n\nOnly 35 countries out of 85 attending the Responsible AI in the Military Domain (REAIM) summit in A Coruna, Spain, on signed a commitment to 20 principles on AI on Thursday.\n\nThese included affirming human responsibility over AI-powered weapons, encouraging clear chains of command and control, and sharing information on national oversight arrangements \"where consistent with national security\".\n\nThe document also outlined the ⁠importance of risk assessments, robust testing and training ​and education for personnel operating military AI capabilities.\n\nAt two ​prior military AI summits in The Hague and Seoul in 2023 and 2024 respectively, around 60 nations, excluding China but including the United States, ‍endorsed a modest \"blueprint ⁠for action\" without legal commitment.\n\nWhile this year's document was also non-binding, some were still uncomfortable with the idea of endorsing more concrete policies, said Yasmin Afina, a ⁠researcher at the U.N. Institute for Disarmament Research, an adviser on the process.\n\nMajor signatories on Thursday included ‌Canada, Germany, France, Britain, the Netherlands, South Korea and Ukraine.",

    "description": "\"It's like a technology monastery thing,\" Musk said about SpaceX's Starbase campus. \"Remote and mostly dudes.\"",
    "fullText": "SpaceX and Tesla both began in California before relocating their headquarters to Texas — a move Elon Musk has said created a hiring challenge.\n\nMusk, the CEO of both companies, said married technicians, engineers, and scientists have struggled to bring their families to certain parts of the state. The problem is most acute at SpaceX's south Texas launch site and headquarters, known as Starbase.\n\n\"I call it the 'significant other' problem,\" Musk said during a nearly three-hour interview with tech podcaster Dwarkesh Patel and Stripe's cofounder John Collison that was posted on Thursday. \"For Starbase, that was particularly difficult, since the odds of finding a non-SpaceX job are pretty low.\"\n\nStarbase — where SpaceX has built and tested its rockets since 2019 — is situated in a sparsely populated area of Texas, close to the US‑Mexico border. It's located across from the largely undeveloped Las Palomas Wildlife Management Area.\n\nThe campus is roughly a 40‑minute drive from Brownsville, the nearest city, according to Google Maps. Brownsville has a population of around 187,000, based on the most recent US Census data.\n\nThat remoteness marks a sharp contrast with SpaceX's former headquarters in El Segundo, California, which is minutes from Los Angeles and part of one of the country's largest job markets.\n\n\"It's like a technology monastery thing,\" Musk said about Starbase. \n\"Remote and mostly dudes.\"\n\nTesla, which moved its headquarters from California to Austin in 2021, faces a similar — though less severe — challenge, Musk said.\n\nThe automaker's campus, called Giga Texas, is a roughly 30-minute drive from downtown Austin, where nearly 1 million people live. Plus, while Tesla's top executives have largely moved to Texas, the electric car company still maintains several robotics, energy, and manufacturing operations in California.\n\n\"Tesla being engineering, especially being primarily in Silicon Valley, it's easier for people to just... They don't have to change their life very much. Their commutes are going to be the same,\" he said. \"Tesla still has a majority of its engineering in California.\"\n\nMusk, who has predicted Austin will be \"the biggest boomtown that America has seen in 50 years,\" has made moves to build out his company campuses, including a company town called \"Snailbrook\" near The Boring Company and SpaceX.",

    "fullText": "Man misidentified by London supermarket using Facewatch system says: ‘I shouldn’t have to prove I am not a criminal’\n\nA man was ordered to leave a supermarket in London after staff misidentified him using controversial new facial recognition technology.\n\nWarren Rajah was told to abandon his shopping and leave the local store he has been using for a number of years after an “Orwellian” error in a Sainsbury’s in Elephant and Castle, London.\n\nHe said supermarket staff were unable to explain why he was being told to leave, and would only direct him to a QR code leading to the website of the firm Facewatch, which the retailer has hired to run facial recognition in some of its stores. He said when he contacted Facewatch, he was told to send in a picture of himself and a photograph of his passport before the firm confirmed it had no record of him on its database.\n\n“One of the reasons I was angry was because I shouldn’t have to prove I am innocent,” Rajah said. “I shouldn’t have to prove I’m wrongly identified as a criminal.” He described the incident as feeling “quite like Minority Report, Orwellian”.\n\nHe said while doing his normal shop, he was approached by three members of the store’s staff, one of whom appeared to affirm that he was the person pictured on a device they had. It is understood the Facewatch system flagged someone else who had entered the store, and staff mistook Rajah for him.\n\nRajah was concerned some form of permanent record implying he had been involved in criminality might have been created on Facewatch’s system. Eventually, the firm told him he was not on its database and referred him back to Sainsbury’s.\n\n“You felt quite helpless in the situation because you’re just thrown from pillar to post – because Sainsbury’s initially blame Facewatch, then Facewatch retort saying it’s actually Sainsbury’s,” he said. “And then, when Sainsbury’s called me on Wednesday from the executive office, they blamed the store staff. So they’re constantly shifting the blame as to who’s responsible for this.”\n\nRajah was upset that he felt he had had to prove his innocence – and said he had received little assurance about how the information he had to hand over to Facewatch was stored, and whether it had been deleted.\n\nAnd he said that, while he was lucky enough to be able to navigate the system, “what happens to the vulnerable people who, for example, have learning disabilities or don’t know how to scan a QR code? They haven’t put any processes or procedures in place for anybody to challenge this. You should not be expected to send your personal information – that is totally unacceptable.”\n\nSainsbury’s said: “We have been in contact with Mr Rajah to sincerely apologise for his experience in our Elephant and Castle store. This was not an issue with the facial recognition technology in use but a case of the wrong person being approached in store.”\n\nFacewatch said: “We’re sorry to hear about Mr Rajah’s experience and understand why it would have been upsetting. This incident arose from a case of human error in store, where a member of staff approached the wrong customer.\n\n“Our data protection team followed the usual process to confirm his identity and verified that he was not on our database and had not been subject to any alerts generated by Facewatch.”",

In the end, Chen and Gendron wrote a paper presenting their idea as a conjecture, rather than a theorem.\n\nChen recently spent hours prompting ChatGPT in the hopes of getting the AI to come up with a solution to the still unsolved problem, but it wasn’t working. Then, during a reception at a math conference in Washington, DC, last month, Chen ran into Ken Ono, a well-known mathematician who had recently left his job at the University of Virginia to join Axiom, an artificial intelligence startup cofounded by one of his mentees, Carina Hong.\n\nChen told Ono about the problem, and the following morning, Ono presented him with a proof, courtesy of his startup’s math-solving AI, AxiomProver. “Everything fell into place naturally after that,” says Chen, who worked with Axiom to write up the proof, which has now been posted to arXiv, a public repository for academic papers.\n\nAxiom’s AI tool found a connection between the problem and a numerical phenomenon first studied in the 19th century. It then devised a proof, which it helpfully verified itself. “What AxiomProver found was something that all the humans had missed,” Ono tells WIRED.\n\nThe proof is one of several solutions to unsolved math problems that Axiom says its system has come up with in recent weeks. The AI has not yet solved any of the most famous (or lucrative) problems in the field of mathematics, but it has found answers to questions that have stumped experts in different areas for years. The proofs are evidence of AI’s steadily advancing math abilities. In recent months, other mathematicians have reported using AI tools to explore new ideas and solve existing problems.\n\nThe techniques being developed by Axiom may prove useful outside the world of advanced math. For example, the same approaches could be used to develop software that is more resilient to certain kinds of cybersecurity attacks. This would involve using AI to verify that code is provably reliable and trustworthy.\n\n“Math is really the great test ground and sandbox for reality,” says Hong, Axiom’s CEO. “We do believe that there are a lot of pretty important use cases of high commercial value.”\n\nAxiom’s approach involves combining large language models with a proprietary AI system called AxiomProver that is trained to reason through math problems to reach solutions that are provably correct. In 2024, Google demonstrated a similar idea with a system called AlphaProof. Hong says that AxiomSolver incorporates several significant advances and newer techniques.\n\nOno says the AI-generated proof for the Chen-Gendron conjecture shows how AI can now meaningfully assist professional mathematicians. “This is a new paradigm for proving theorems,” he says.\n\nAxiom’s system is more than just a regular AI model, in that it is able to verify proofs using a specialized mathematical language called Lean. Rather than just search through the literature, this allows AxiomProver to develop genuinely novel ways of solving problems.\n\nAnother one of the new proofs generated by AxiomProver demonstrates how the AI is capable of solving math problems entirely on its own. That proof, which has also been described in a paper posted to arXiv, provides a solution to Fel’s Conjecture, which concerns syzygies, or mathematical expressions where numbers line up in algebra. Remarkably, the conjecture involves formulas first found in the notebook of legendary Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan more than 100 years ago. In this case AxiomProver did not just fill in a missing piece of the puzzle, it devised the proof from start to finish.",

    "description": "In 2026, we will replace most of our SaaS with vibe-coded solutions - Low/No-Code SaaS will die - startups are the canary in the coal mine.",
    "fullText": "As late as December 30th 2025, Hopsworks's website contained well over 1,000 pages. It was a mix of blogs, dictionary entries, videos, and various content types - but mostly, it was a pile of legacy pages and landing pages.\n\nAs of today, February 2026, thanks to tools like Claude Code, we have completely shifted our approach. Within a week, we have cut our page count in half, moved away from our legacy hosting and CMS, and essentially refactored the whole site. The result is a platform that is:\n\nBack in 2018, we chose Webflow as our hosting and CMS solution. Quite honestly, it proved to be exactly what we needed at the time. It was easy for non-technical users to maintain and made adding content easy. But, like everything else, this convenience came at a cost. Over time, we accumulated layers of legacy content and structural debt. We became highly dependent on their platform, meaning our entire library was hosted on their infrastructure with very little flexibility to move out.\n\nA few of us on the team grew to be avid - if not overly enthusiastic - users of Claude Code, not unlike a large portion of your favourite social media's front-page I am sure. And as our internal usage grew over the course of the year, a new paradigm emerged. As product owners, and marketeers, we realized we no longer wanted to spend time \"moving boxes\" in a UI. We wanted to alter and shape the code directly to output what we needed, often based on existing content.\n\nAnd so we realised over time that the handy low-code/UI-driven approach of Webflow became not quite so handy anymore. We wanted to change the code directly, not just tweak a component here and there. Dragging and dropping had simply become a drag that we wanted to drop (pun intended).\n\nWe made the jump in a single go. We pulled the whole website and its content library, asked Claude to parse it, created a skeleton using an open-source headless CMS, and migrated all content to Markdown We then re-created the frontend, partly based on the same UI library we use for our own software platform.\n\nTwo hours later, a functional, viable draft containing the entire content of the old website was online.\n\nIt took just two hours to rebuild, re-architect, and redeploy a functional website based on the 1,000 pages of the old one. It took a few more hours to set up proper redirects, SEO, polishes and debugs. It was a cathartic - albeit scary - experiment to think that we were about to essentially erase six years of a relationship with a toolset in a single afternoon.\n\nA new and unexpected benefit of this shift is the cultural change within the team. Moving even less technical team members toward a technical stack consisting of version control, IDEs, and CLIs forces them to engage with the tools that our engineering team uses every day.\n\nThis lowers the \"understanding gap\" between teams. Everyone is now speaking a more common language. While the depth of knowledge may differ, it provides a starting point for collaboration.\n\nSome of the benefits we actually found can be summed up in this table:\n\nGaining full control over our code also meant we could no longer blame anyone when things looked wrong. And things looked very wrong. It did seem like it didn't work, at all, a massive loss of 80% of the traffic was registering on all analytics.\n\nQuite honestly, it was a terrible couple of weeks wondering if that was just vibe coded slop, missing content during the migration, Google penalising us, SEO schemas not being set properly, redirects not working; you name it we thought about it all day every day. The inherent nature of traffic taking time to be impacted by changes also meant; we had to be sort of patient with our assumptions.\n\nUntil a few days ago, when we had a realization; when we rebuilt the website, we thought also to rebuild the analytics and how we were tracking users.\n\nIt turns out, with our previous setup. We were tracking more visitors than we intended to. What happened is that we were not storing user information if they did not accept our terms, and so they were anonymous to us, but there were no such mechanics for Google Analytics so Google tracked them anyway.\n\nNow, with the website being rebuilt. We followed best practices; accepting cookies would directly impact whether the website would be passing user information to Google and other third party analytical tools as well as ourselves. And so, it turns out, lots of users do not want to accept cookies, and it turns out, we do not send their information to Google; we do however, have set an internal cookieless analytical tool (self-hosted in EU & no IP collection) to indeed see the traffic on our site.\n\nSo we did not lose 80% of traffic. Sorry. We did not in fact lose much traffic at all (there was a drop post-migration that now seems to recover organically). We vibe coded best practices in passing, forgot about it, scared ourselves, spent a few weeks thinking that our whole plan was a terrible idea and that we should admit defeat. Turns out it is all good.\n\nWell, any other tools that have added debt, cost, and systemic weight to the organization with obvious ones like - CRMs, marketing automation, and such. If everything is just a table somewhere, and if everything can be created bespoke in a few hours, why pay tens of thousands of euros for it? We are doing the work of setting it up, managing the data, cleaning and integration with our ecosystem anyways. The value seems to be diminishing by the hour.\n\nDoes this imply that every software company must take a hard look at their value proposition and ask themselves: \"Are we at risk of becoming commodified by tooling such as Claude?\"...\n\nWe are ourselves a software company; we are builders, and we know that we also would either benefit or suffer from the very same question; a simple prompt such as \"Please create my own feature store and MLOps platform,\" where a few hours later, the organization has its own bespoke tool. So where to draw the line?\n\nIt sits at the runtime/engine/core. What gets commoditised is the setup, the glue, the configuration and orchestration layers; things you can prompt into existence. What doesn't is the core: the API, the execution engine, the years of production edge-cases baked into a platform. You can prompt your way into connecting a feature store, configuring it, deploying pipelines on top of it; but the platform that runs them reliably at scale is not a weekend project.\n\nSo, for us, this is exactly where we are going. We aim to apply that same lesson to our own very own software platform, making it something users can operate on and build upon at the speed they can prompt. This must be the new motto for startups. Business as usual is but a prompt away from being replaced.\n\nP.S. While writing this article, the following message was sent to a colleague:\n\nThe table you see above is now actual markdown, not an image. One down, a few more to go.",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google’s latest quarterly report provided further evidence that its internet empire is withstanding an artificial intelligence shakeup that’s turning into another potential boon for the company.\n\nThe numbers released Wednesday marked Google's third consecutive quarter of digital ad growth of more than 10% from the previous year, while also posting more than 30% sales growth in its division that powers data centers for AI services.\n\nWhat drove Google's strong Q4 financial performance?\n\nWhat impact did the antitrust ruling have?\n\nHow is Google competing against AI startups?\n\nHow much is Alphabet investing in AI infrastructure?\n\nThose increases during the October-December period propelled Google’s corporate parent Alphabet Inc. well past the earnings forecasts of stock market analysts.\n\nAlphabet’s fourth-quarter profit rose 30% from the prior year to $34.5 billion, or $2.82 per share, while revenue climbed 18% to $113.8 billion.\n\nThe collective momentum of Google’s main business in search and advertising and the still-nascent AI field indicates a company born during the late 1990s internet boom is becoming even stronger during another technology phenomenon nearly 30 years later.\n\n“Search saw more usage than ever before, with AI continuing to drive an expansionary moment,\" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said.\n\nGoogle’s successful evolution has helped drive up Alphabet’s stock price nearly 60% in the past five months, giving it a $4 trillion market value. Even so, some investors are still skeptical whether Google will be able to sustain enough growth to justify the more than $300 billion that Alphabet will have spent from 2024 through the end of this year on expanding the computing capacity needed for AI features. Those worries caused Alphabet's shares to see-saw between slight gains and declines during extended trading after Wednesday's report came out.\n\nApple, also currently worth $4 trillion, thinks so highly of Google’s AI that the iPhone maker recently struck a deal to use Google’s Gemini technology in a long-delayed upgrade to its virtual assistant, Siri.\n\nGoogle is also embedding more of its Gemini AI into its long-dominant search engine, Gmail and Chrome browser as it tries to avoid complacency and being outmaneuvered by up-and-coming companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Perplexity.\n\nTo meet the challenge, Alphabet has been on a spending spree to expand its AI capacity. After pouring $91 billion into capital expenditures devoted mostly to AI, the Mountain View, California, company disclosed Wednesday that it expects to double down by spending another $175 billion to $185 billion this year. Its capital expenditure budget has ballooned from about $30 billion annually since 2022 when OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot to much acclaim, prompting Google to pull out all the stops to catch up.",

    "fullText": "Six key initiatives are highlighted, offering an insight into the future of NFC tech\n\n2 February 2026 – NFC Forum, the global standards body for Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, has today announced its latest roadmap for the development of NFC Forum Standards and its corresponding technical capabilities. New topics to be progressed over the forthcoming years include faster data rates, end-to-end application testing, and security advancements. Additionally, ongoing work will continue to evolve the NFC Wireless Charging offer, advance multipurpose tap and explore new digital key requirements.\n\nThe roadmap was collaboratively developed by the NFC Forum Board members - including representatives from Apple, Google, Huawei, Identiv, Infineon, NuCurrent, NXP Semiconductors, Sony, and ST Microelectronics - in consultation with the NFC Forum membership and industry partners to ensure anticipated market requirements are addressed.\n\nThe six key roadmap priorities include:\n\nFaster Data Rates. Exploring the potential to increase the standardized current rate at which data can be transferred between two devices by up to eight times, delivering a smoother and more responsive NFC user experience.\n\nImproving Reader Mode Interoperability. Providing end-to-end interoperability testing to confirm that new and updated applications successfully and consistently operate on NFC Forum Certified Devices, improving NFC Reader Mode reliability across all use cases.\n\nSecurity Advancements. Publishing NFC Forum’s first-ever NFC Controllers Security Profile, as well as looking to future proof NFC security protocols against Post Quantum Computing threats and strengthening NFC against relay-based attacks.\n\nWireless Power Evolution. Commencing work on the next generation of NFC Forum Wireless Charging Specifications to define device category specific profiles, support devices with multiple wireless charging receivers, and deliver higher charging power levels.\n\nMulti-Purpose Tap. Defining the technical proposals required to bring the concept of supporting several actions with a single ‘tap’ to market. This includes the ability of the NFC Reader to specify and request the specific credentials needed to perform a user action.\n\nDigital Keys. Exploring innovative new digital key experiences to ensure NFC Forum Standards support a range of industry requirements.\n\nMike McCamon, Executive Director of NFC Forum, comments: “NFC is a well-established and trusted foundational technology for countless devices and use cases across almost every market. To ensure that each of these deployments work in the seamless manner that customers expect from NFC, it is vital that the NFC Forum develops global standards that deliver true industry harmonization. Furthermore, to enable these standards to be adopted and applied at scale, it is equally important that all NFC stakeholders are aware of our plans and engage with NFC Forum in our development processes. This approach ensures future evolutions continue to align with both their current NFC use cases as well as their long-term ambitions.”\n\nNFC Forum last released a Technology Roadmap in 2023. A key element of this was increasing operating volumes and advancing its specifications to support the Digital Product Passport requirements. Both these ambitions were delivered as part of NFC Release 15 in June 2025.\n\n“For more than 20 years, NFC Forum has empowered organizations to create innovative contactless experiences backed by intuitive, reliable and consistent NFC open standards,” adds Mike. “The active engagement in the evolution of NFC technology from an ever-increasing number of industries is testament to the clear value it provides to users globally. As we accelerate across the arc of contactless towards inevitable ubiquity, we encourage discussion and welcome new contributions from across the ecosystem.”\n\nLearn more about the 2026 NFC Forum Technology Roadmap.\n\nThe Roadmap will be discussed in more detail in our upcoming webinar on February 26. Registrations are now open.",

    "fullText": "Pedro Sánchez says urgent action needed to protect children from ‘digital wild west’, drawing anger from owner of X\n\nSpain has proposed a ban on social media use by teenagers as attitudes hardened in Europe against the technology, drawing personal insults against the prime minister from Elon Musk.\n\nThe government is preparing a series of measures including a social media ban for under-16s, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said, promising to protect children from the “digital wild west” and hold tech companies responsible for hateful and harmful content.\n\nSánchez said on Tuesday that urgent action was needed because social media was a “failed state where laws are ignored and crimes are tolerated”.\n\nHe also took Musk to task for using X to “amplify disinformation” over his administration’s decision last week to regularise 500,000 undocumented workers and asylum seekers, pointing out that Musk was himself a migrant.\n\nMusk wrote on X in response: “Dirty Sánchez is a tyrant and a traitor to the people of Spain.” About an hour and a half later, he escalated his criticism, posting on X: “Sánchez is the true fascist totalitarian.”\n\nRepresentatives of Google, part of Alphabet, TikTok, Snapchat and Meta did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Spain’s proposed measures.\n\nGreece is also close to announcing a similar ban for children under 15, a senior government source said.\n\nSpain and Greece look set to join countries such as Britain and France in considering tougher stances on social media, after Australia in December became the first nation to prohibit access to such platforms for children younger than 16.\n\nGovernments and regulators worldwide are looking at the impact of children’s screen time on their development and mental wellbeing.\n\n“Our children are exposed to a space they were never meant to navigate alone … We will no longer accept that,” Sanchez said at the World Governments Summit in Dubai. “We will protect them from the digital wild west.”\n\nSpain joins five other European countries that he called the “coalition of the digitally willing” to coordinate and enforce cross-border regulation, Sanchez said, without naming the countries, set to hold their first meeting in the coming days.\n\n“We know that this is a battle that far exceeds the boundaries of any country,” he said. His office did not respond to a request for clarification.\n\nLegislation to ban children under 15 from social media is passing through France’s parliament. Britain is also considering similar measures.\n\nSpain’s proposed regulation would give parents clear backing to set limits and would ease social pressure for children worried about missing out, said Diana Diaz, director of the ANAR Foundation for at-risk children and adolescents.\n\nThe recent explosion of AI-generated content, and public outcry over reports of Musk’s Grok AI chatbot generating non-consensual sexual images, including of minors, has fuelled debate over the risks of such online content.\n\nBut there was no unanimous agreement that social media harms adolescents, said Jose Cesar Perales, a professor in experimental psychology at the University of Granada.\n\nSanchez said prosecutors would explore ways to investigate possible legal infractions by Grok, as well as by TikTok and Instagram, part of Meta.\n\nThe proposed ban would be implemented as part of a change to an existing bill on digital protection for minors being debated in parliament, a government spokesperson said.\n\nAbout 82% of people in Spain said they believed children under 14 should be banned from social media, according to an Ipsos poll on education published in August last year. That was up from 73% in 2024.",

    "fullText": "The stock market was hit with a wave of selling on Tuesday as traders dumped some of the market's highest-flying tech names and reacted to a spike in oil prices.\n\nLegal-software stocks were a particularly weak point, with many falling by double digits, after Anthropic unveiled new tools that can track compliance and review legal docs.\n\nOn the tech side, investors have been wary of high valuations for months, and are anxiously watching for signs that the AI trade is under pressure. A rotation into other parts of the market that began at the start of the year accelerated in Tuesday's session.\n\nWhile many of the top tech and AI names in the S&P 500, stocks in other sectors jumped as investors looked for better deals. FedEx stock was up more than 5%, and retailers including Walmart, Target, and Costco rose as much as 2%.\n\nMeanwhile, oil spiked and the Cboe volatility index rose nearly 20% on fresh Middle East tensions after the US said it shot down an Iranian drone.\n\nInvestors fear that higher oil prices could weigh on the US economy by causing renewed upward pressure on inflation. Brent crude, the international benchmark, was up 2% to about $67.50 a barrel, reflecting an 11% increase from its low in December. US oil prices were also up 2% to about $63.50 a barrel.\n\nThe major indexes sank into the red in the early afternoon, but pared the deepest losses. The Dow clawed back much of its drop of more than 500 points and the Nasdaq ended lower by 1.4% after declining by over 2% during the session.\n\n\"The enthusiasm for AI rolls through peaks and valleys,\" Louis Naveillier, the chairman of Naveillier & Associates, wrote in a note on Tuesday during the tech sell-off. \"These higher energy prices will add to inflation pressure,\" he added of the move higher in oil.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood at the 4 p.m. ET closing bell on Tuesday:\n\nHere were the big moves in the tech sector:\n\nMega-cap tech stocks have been front-of-mind all week as more companies report results for the fourth quarter. Some tech giants, like Microsoft, plunged as investors continue to express concerns over how much firms are spending on artificial intelligence without a clear outlook for how huge capex will translate into returns.\n\nInvestors had been keeping a closer eye on oil prices this year amid geopolitical tensions between the US and other major crude producers, like Venezuela and Iran. In January, some forecasters were eyeing the possibility of an oil shock, a situation where crude prices jump due to supply disruptions, hurting economic activity.",

    "fullText": "Minister announces Microsoft, Cisco and Adobe to help apply AI to local schools, hospitals, GPs and businesses\n\nIn 2002 Barnsley toyed with a redesign as a Tuscan hill village as it sought out a brighter post-industrial future. In 2021 it adopted the airily vague slogan “the place of possibilities”. Now it is trying a different image: Britain’s first “tech town”.\n\nThe technology secretary, Liz Kendall, has anointed the South Yorkshire community as a trailblazer for “how AI can improve everyday life” in the UK.\n\nIn the latest move in Labour’s drive to inject AI into Britain’s bloodstream, the government has announced four US tech companies – Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Adobe – have agreed to help as the council pushes to apply AI to local schools, hospitals, GPs and businesses in Barnsley, an area of South Yorkshire which has struggled with unemployment and deprivation since the coal pits closed.\n\nThe town and its 250,000 people have been chosen because they have already adopted AI faster than many places, said Sir Stephen Houghton, the Labour leader of Barnsley metropolitan borough council. His authority has been using AI assistants for the last couple of years in adult social care and children’s services, and its bin lorries have been enabled with tech to scan roads for potholes. The parcel company Evri, which has one of its largest distribution hubs in the town, has been trialling robot dogs for deliveries.\n\nBut local opposition leaders have warned rebranding Barnsley as a tech town “might seem a bit of a leap” and highlighted local anxiety about whether AI is a force for good.\n\nThe “tech town” status means residents will get free AI and digital training, businesses will be supported to adopt AI, the hospital will test AI tools for check-ins, triage and outpatient care and AI will be tested in schools and at Barnsley College, all in an effort to improve pupils’ results and teachers’ workloads.\n\n“The economic basis of Barnsley was destroyed 30 years ago,” Houghton said. “This is the biggest opportunity we have had since then. The future of the economy is going to be in technology and for Barnsley to be at the centre of that is an incredible opportunity.”\n\nBut one area of uncertainty is the role of the tech companies. Houghton said: “The council won’t be paying them. Whether the government is, we have to wait and see.”\n\nMicrosoft already has a relationship with Barnsley College and, along with Google and Cisco, is understood to be working on a pro bono basis.\n\n“If we are going to get AI to work for Britain, we need Britons and British public services that can work with AI,” Kendall said. “If we can show that AI helps young people learn, supports local businesses to be more productive, and improves public services, then we can show what’s possible for the whole country. What we learn here will shape how we roll out AI across the UK.”\n\nMinisters have faced criticism over their handling of big technology companies. Last week the government launched a national AI training programme to upskill 10 million citizens, but many of the online courses turned out to be bespoke training for customers of particular companies such as Google, others cost as much as £525 to complete and some simply promoted the merits of particular company’s approaches to AI such as one explaining Microsoft’s “responsible AI approach”.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said hundreds of courses on the AI Skills Hub are free and where payment is required it is clearly advertised. “All courses are reviewed against a common set of criteria to ensure they are relevant, high quality, and delivered by eligible organisations,” they said.\n\nMinisters have also been challenged for holding meetings with tech bosses at the rate of more than once each working day. The government insists engagement is vital to create growth and transform services.\n\n“It’s not about giving tech companies access to data they shouldn’t be having,” Houghton said. “It’s a secure programme and we are not leaving ourselves open. But this stuff is not going away. We have to make sure we are smart enough to protect people while taking advantage of the positive stuff it brings.”\n\nHannah Kitching, the leader of the council’s Liberal Democrat opposition, said investment in the town was welcome but “there is a lot of anxiety among people about the use of AI and whether it is a force for good. We know it could be but there are darker sides as well.”\n\n“[Barnsley] is still really connected to its mining past,” she said. “Younger people see the jobs and opportunities around the tech town idea but older generations perhaps don’t. There is a job to be done to get people onboard.”\n\nResidents “want the council to get the basics right”, she said. Roads were “absolutely crumbling” and in bad weather bins did not get collected, she added.",

    "fullText": "NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — There’s a chance the dreaded buzz of propellers heard on Ukrainian battlefields is coming from drones built in a country with a population of just over a million on Europe’s southeastern fringe: Cyprus.\n\nManufacturer Swarmly says there are more than 200 of its H-10 Poseidon drones helping Ukrainian artillery batteries pinpoint enemy targets on the ground in all kinds of weather, racking up more than 100,000 hours in the air over the last three years.\n\nIts 5,000-square-meter (54,000-square-foot) factory, where the whir of grinders shaping composite plastics reverberates off the walls, has become a major source of uncrewed vehicles shipped to countries such as Indonesia, Benin, Nigeria, India and Saudi Arabia, according to company officials. Most of the factory floor is reserved for uncrewed aerial vehicle manufacture. But tucked in a secure storage area is a selection of Swarmly's super-fast marine drones replete with high-definition cameras and .50-caliber machine guns.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has driven even the smallest European Union member countries to develop their home-grown, high-tech defense industries, just as necessity has made Kyiv a world leader in cutting-edge UAV technology. Many EU countries have partnered with Kyiv to develop that technology, and Ukraine’s front lines are usually their testing grounds.\n\nLike Cyprus, the Baltic countries and Denmark have revved up their domestic drone and counter-drone technology. In Greece, drones are part of a 25-billion euro ($29-billion) overhaul of its armed forces.\n\n“The example of Swarmy, as well as other important companies based in small EU countries, is a testament to the serious effort made by the private sector in Europe to innovate and build mass production capacity of defense items, including uncrewed systems,” said Federico Borsari, an expert with the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis.\n\nUAVs are reshaping warfare by offering less militarily capable countries some leverage over superior adversaries. Drones aren't going to completely replace big-ticket weaponry like tanks, artillery and warplanes, said Borsari. But they offer flexibility and bang for the buck, making them a formidable force multiplier.\n\nTake Swarmly's explosives-packed, satellite-guided Hydra marine drone. Each one costs 80,000 euros ($94,500), which means deploying a group of them to neutralize a billion-euro warship can be a bargain, said company director Gary Rafalovsky.\n\nThis sort of naval weapon taking out a much larger warship is already evidenced by Houthi attacks from Yemen, according to Fabian Hinz, a research fellow for missile technologies and UAVs at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Europe.\n\nBarriers to entry for undercapitalized companies are low, he added, because UAVs are often designed and assembled from components cheaply and readily available on the global market.\n\n“And that, of course, means that basically you don’t have to have a great industrial investment at first that you need with other military capabilities. You don’t need decades of experience in certain material sciences or these kinds of things,” Hinz said.\n\nIn Denmark, a pair of companies focusing on anti-drone devices have reported a surge in new clients, and some of the devices were to be shipped to Ukraine to assist in jamming Russian technology on the battlefield. Ukraine in September said it was partnering with Danish companies to build missile and drone components at a factory in Denmark.\n\nIn the Baltic country of Lithuania, scientists and business partners have joined forces under the name VILNIUS TECH to develop UAVs, automated mine detection and other military technologies. The state-run ammunition factory Giraite says it has increased production capacity by 50% since 2022.\n\nGreece for the first time showcased its homemade drones and counter-drone technology during a full tactical exercise in November as NATO urged Europe's defense sector to pick up the pace.\n\n“We need capabilities, equipment, real firepower and the most advanced technology,” NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte warned during a visit to Romania earlier that month. “Bring your ideas, test your ingenuity and use NATO as your test bed.”\n\nEven as drone development accelerates, Borsari cautioned that the advantages of UAVs are often tempered by numerous variables like the harsh conditions in which they sometimes fly, operators’ training and skill levels, as well as the depth of logistical support to keep them functional.\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine and the Trump administration’s mixed messages that have strained relations with NATO allies have forced European leaders to reckon with the need to become more self-reliant on defense. So the EU has made billions of euros available to encourage investment and bolster its collective deterrent capability.\n\nThat's been a boost to nations like Cyprus, which assumed the six-month EU presidency on Jan. 1. Last week, the EU’s executive arm approved financial assistance for eight members including Spain, Croatia, Portugal, Bulgaria, Belgium, Romania and Cyprus.\n\nCyprus is set to receive final approval from EU leaders for some 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in low-cost, long-term loans under the EU’s 150-billion-euro joint ($177-billion) procurement program called Security Action for Europe (SAFE).\n\nIts nascent defense industry is already made up of around 30 companies and research centers that produce technology for both civilian and military sectors, including robotics, communications networks, anti-drone systems and even satellite communications and surveillance, said Panayiotis Hadjipavlis, chief of the armaments and defense capabilities development directorate within Cyprus' Defense Ministry.\n\n“We have niche capabilities on very high-tech products and this has to be taken seriously into account,” Hadjipavlis told The Associated Press in his office, where the helmet from his fighter pilot days hung on a nearby coat rack.\n\nMajor defense industry players, he added, are among those who should take note.",

    "fullText": "Feb 2 (Reuters) - Elon Musk said on Monday that SpaceX has acquired his artificial-intelligence startup xAI in a record-setting deal that unifies Musk's AI and space ambitions by combining ​the rocket-and-satellite company with the maker of the Grok chatbot.\n\nThe deal, first reported by Reuters last week, ‌represents one of the most ambitious tie-ups in the technology sector yet, combining a space-and-defense contractor with a fast-growing AI developer whose costs are largely ‌driven by chips, data centers and energy. It could also bolster SpaceX’s data-center ambitions as Musk competes with rivals like Alphabet's Google, Meta, Amazon-backed Anthropic and OpenAI in the AI sector.\n\nWhat regulatory challenges could this merger face?\n\nWhat makes SpaceX's xAI acquisition record-breaking?\n\nHow will combining SpaceX and xAI benefit both companies?\n\nHow does this fit into Musk's broader business strategy?\n\nThe transaction values SpaceX at $1 trillion, and xAI at $250 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\n\"This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI's mission: ⁠scaling to make a sentient sun to ‌understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!\" Musk said.\n\nThe purchase of xAI sets a new record for the world's largest M&A deal, a distinction held for ‍more than 25 years when Vodafone bought Germany’s Mannesmann in a hostile takeover valued at $203 billion in 2000, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nThe combined company of SpaceX and xAI is expected to price shares at about $527 each, another person familiar with the matter said. ​SpaceX was already the world's most valuable privately held company, last valued at $800 billion in a recent insider share ‌sale. XAI was last valued at $230 billion in November, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe merger comes as the space company plans a blockbuster public offering this year that could value it at over $1.5 trillion, two people familiar with the matter said.\n\nSpaceX, xAI and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe deal further consolidates Musk's far-flung business empire and fortunes into a tighter, mutually reinforcing ecosystem – what some investors and analysts informally call the \"Muskonomy\" – which already includes Tesla, ⁠brain-chip maker Neuralink and tunnel firm the Boring Company.\n\nThe world's richest man ​has a history of merging his ventures together. Musk folded social media ​platform X into xAI through a share swap last year, giving the AI startup access to the platform’s data and distribution. In 2016, he used Tesla's stock to buy his solar-energy company SolarCity.\n\nThe ‍agreement could draw scrutiny from regulators and ⁠investors over governance, valuation and conflicts of interest given Musk's overlapping leadership roles across multiple firms, as well as the potential movement of engineers, proprietary technology and contracts between entities.",

    "title": "New Discovery In Laser Technology Could Change Everything For Quantum Computing",
    "description": "Quantum computing has great potential , but its main unit, the qubit, is beset by inherent stability problems. However, this new study might change that.",
    "fullText": "The idea behind quantum computing has existed for a long while now, with the primary goal being to basically create supercomputers capable of calculating intensive problems almost instantly. While we have yet to see a fully realized quantum computer that comes close to that overall vision, we have seen a lot of progress forward. One big problem that quantum computing has is getting all of the components together in a stable environment and then scaling it up without ruining that stability. The biggest problem here comes in how we approach the scaling of qubits — which are vital to how information and data are processed in quantum computers. However, a new bit of research could help change how we approach that issue by providing an entirely new way to look at scaling qubits effectively.\n\nWhile we have seen promising progress in futuristic quantum computing and algorithms, the overall scalability of quantum computing is still small, and having actual, tangible quantum computers that can solve some of our most demanding problems still feels a long way off. In fact, some research has noted that we'll need quantum computers with several million qubits to have any chance at an early commercial application. So how do we achieve that kind of scalability? Well, some believe that a surface approach might be the answer. But to fully understand how that approach will work, and what it will fix, we have to look at the problem a bit more closer.\n\nJust like a bit is the most basic unit of information in classic computers, the qubit is the most basic unit in quantum computing. It stands for quantum bit, and up until now, researchers have had an incredibly difficult time scaling it up to a point that will make quantum computing more reliable and effective.\n\nThe problem with scaling up the number of qubits needed in a quantum computer is that each physical qubit is especially fragile and susceptible to noise. This means that each of those qubits is prone to errors, and as you add more physical qubits in one place, you're going to see more noise generated around your quantum operations. As such, you'll see more quantum information degrading, and degrading faster — in even as little as microseconds, some speculate.\n\nTo help overcome these noise issues, scientists have come up with a process known as quantum error correction — which essentially aims to add in a new piece to the puzzle called logical qubits, which are intended to filter out the noise and keep the qubits and how they process information under control. However, researchers have seen somewhat limited success in how they can scale up the amount of physical and logical qubits in a quantum computer while still keeping the amount of errors below a certain threshold.\n\nIn a new study from Columbia University, researchers highlighted how they created some of the biggest quantum arrays yet by utilizing a surface approach that combines powerful lasers and optical tweezers to capture single atoms, allowing for \"unprecedented levels of control over single atoms and molecules.\" Furthermore, the success seen in this study comes directly from a new approach to creating the optical tweezer arrays, which the researchers refer to as metasurfaces. These arrays aren't made up of physical tweezers as you might think of them, of course. Instead, they are actually highly focused beams of light that are strong enough to trap small objects, such as atoms.\n\nUnlike traditional attempts to scale qubits, the metasurfaces utilize two-dimensional arrays of \"nano-meter-sized pixels\" that take a single beam of light and shape it into a uniform and unique pattern across the entire surface. The team was able to trap 1,000 strontium atoms — which can naturally function as qubits — using the method, and they say it could be scaled up to capture more. The point here is that this method of scaling allows for identical atoms across the board, which should make them more stable. The researchers say their next goal is to capture a hundred thousand atoms.\n\nNew approaches like this could further other quantum research greatly. Recently, researchers managed to achieve \"teleportation\" using quantum supercomputers. While exciting in its own right, it's ultimately just about sharing data between two computers, though — not quite the \"Beam me up, Scotty\" moment that any \"Star Trek\" fans were probably hoping for. But with more scalable quantum systems, it's impossible to say what else scientists might be able to accomplish.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "title": "Yann LeCun, an A.I. Pioneer, Warns the Tech 'Herd' Could Hit a Dead End",
    "description": "Yann LeCun helped create the technology behind today’s chatbots. Now he says many tech companies are on the wrong path to creating intelligent machines.",
    "fullText": "Throughout his 40-year career as a computer scientist, Yann LeCun has earned a reputation as one of the world’s leading experts on artificial intelligence and a man with a penchant for throwing verbal grenades.\n\nHe was one of three pioneering researchers who received the Turing Award, often called “the Nobel Prize of computing,” for their work on the technology that is now the foundation for modern A.I. For more than a decade, he also served as chief A.I. scientist at Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram.\n\nBut after leaving Meta in November, Dr. LeCun has become increasingly vocal in his criticism of Silicon Valley’s single-minded approach to building intelligent machines. He argues that the technology industry will eventually hit a dead end in its A.I. development — after years of work and hundreds of billions of dollars spent.\n\nThe reason, he said, goes back to what he has argued for years: Large language models, or L.L.M.s, the A.I. technology at the heart of popular products like ChatGPT, can get only so powerful. And companies are throwing everything they have at projects that won’t get them to their goal to make computers as smart as or even smarter than humans. More creative Chinese companies, he added, could get there first.\n\n“There is this herd effect where everyone in Silicon Valley has to work on the same thing,” he said during a recent interview from his home in Paris. “It does not leave much room for other approaches that may be much more promising in the long term.”\n\nThat critique is the latest shot in a debate that has roiled the tech industry since OpenAI sparked the A.I. boom in 2022 with the release of ChatGPT: Is it possible to create so-called artificial general intelligence or even more powerful superintelligence? And can companies get there using their current technology and concepts?\n\nFew scientists have as much history with the topic as Dr. LeCun, 65. Much of what the tech industry is trying to do now has its roots in an idea that he has nurtured since the 1970s. As a young engineering student in Paris, he embraced a concept called neural networks, even though most researchers thought the idea was hopeless.\n\nNeural networks are mathematical systems that learn skills by analyzing data. At the time, they had no practical use. But a decade later, when he was a researcher at Bell Labs, Dr. LeCun and his colleagues showed that these systems could learn to read handwriting scribbled on envelopes or personal checks.\n\nNot long after ChatGPT was released, the two researchers who received the 2018 Turing Award with Dr. LeCun warned that A.I. was growing too powerful. Those scientists even warned that the technology could threaten the future of humanity. Dr. LeCun argued that was absurd.\n\n“There was a lot of noise around the idea that A.I. systems were intrinsically dangerous and that putting them in the hands of everyone was a mistake,” he said. “But I have never believed in this.”\n\nDr. LeCun also helped push Meta and its rivals to freely share their research through academic-style papers and so-called open source technologies.\n\nAs more people said A.I. could be a threat of some sort to humans, a number of companies curtailed their open source efforts. But Meta kept going. Dr. LeCun repeatedly argued that open source was the safest path. It meant that no one company would control the technology and that anyone could use these systems to identify and fight potential risks.\n\nNow as a number of companies, including Meta, appear to be moving away from that method because they want an edge over their rivals and continue to worry about dangerous uses, Dr. LeCun is warning that American companies could lose their lead to Chinese rivals that are still using open source.\n\n“This is a disaster,” he said. “If everyone is open, the field as a whole progresses faster.”\n\nMeta’s A.I. work ran into a snag last year. After outside researchers criticized the company’s latest technology, Llama 4, and accused Meta of misrepresenting the power of the system, Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, spent billions on a new research lab dedicated to the pursuit of “superintelligence” — a hypothetical A.I. system that exceeds the powers of the human brain.\n\nSix months after the creation of the new lab, Dr. LeCun left Meta to build his own start-up, Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs, or AMI Labs.\n\nEven though his research laid the groundwork for L.L.M.s, Dr. LeCun argued that they were not the final answer to A.I. development. The problem with current systems, he said, is that they do not plan ahead. Trained solely on digital data, they do not have a way of understanding difficulties in the real world.\n\n“L.L.M.s are not a path to superintelligence or even human-level intelligence. I have said that from the beginning,” he said. “The entire industry has been L.L.M.-pilled.”\n\nDuring his last several years at Meta, Dr. LeCun worked on technology that tried to predict the outcome of its actions. That, he said, would allow A.I. to progress beyond the status quo. His new start-up will continue that work.\n\n“This type of system can plan what it is going to do,” he said. “Current systems — L.L.M.s — absolutely cannot do that.”\n\nPart of Dr. LeCun’s argument is that today’s A.I. systems make too many mistakes. As they tackle more complex tasks, he argued, mistakes pile up like cars after a collision on a highway.\n\nBut over the last several years, these systems have steadily improved. And in recent months, the latest models, which are designed to “reason” through questions, have continued to improve in areas like math, science and computer programming.\n\n“These models do make mistakes. But we have shown that a system can try many different options — in its own head, so to speak — before settling on a final answer,” said Rayan Krishnan, the chief executive of Vals AI, a company that tracks the performance of the latest A.I. technologies.\n\n“Progress is not slowing down. It has become clear that language models can take on new tasks and continue to get better at doing everything we want them to do,” he said.\n\nSubbarao Kambhampati, an Arizona State University professor who has been an A.I. researcher nearly as long as Dr. LeCun, agreed that today’s technologies don’t provide a path to true intelligence. But he also pointed out that they were increasingly useful in highly lucrative areas like computer coding. Dr. LeCun’s newer methods, he added, are unproven.\n\nFor Dr. LeCun, that is why his new company is important. The last several decades, he said, are filled with A.I. projects that seemed like a way forward but ran out of steam. And Silicon Valley is not guaranteed to be the winner in this global race.\n\n“The good ideas are coming from China,” he said. “But Silicon Valley also has a superiority complex, so it can’t imagine that good ideas can come from other places.”",

    "description": "After I published my “velocity is the new authority” essay, a reader and dear friend emailed and asked if my framework explained the fraught relationship between media and the technology …",
    "fullText": "After I published my “velocity is the new authority” essay, a reader and dear friend emailed and asked if my framework explained the fraught relationship between media and the technology ecosystem it covers. My one-word reply was “Absolutely.” And here’s why.\n\nIn “comms” across tech, startups, and the larger ecosystem, little seems to matter anymore. It’s hard to pin down anythingconcrete or meaningful. Everything is noise and nothing can be heard.\n\nMost founders (and technology companies) treat comms like a checklist: have something new, draft a story, chase press,issue a release, share it on LinkedIn and X, maybe do a podcast tour. Others skip intermediaries and go straight to their audience. That worked when media was the gatekeeper and friction was high. Building your audience and owning your channels made sense. Today, anyone can go direct, and the noise has exploded. Rising above it gets harder every day.\n\nVelocity is replacing authority as the organizing principle for information. You see it in the broken relationship between media and the technology ecosystem. The YouTube tech review I wrote about earlier highlights the core issue: access.\n\nAccess journalism is as old as media itself. These days though, it is table stakes. Not just in tech, but across all media. I didn’t play the access game, so I was not a preferred “leaker” for many technology companies. I got my stories the old-fashioned way. By being an annoying scoop hunter. It didn’t pan out often, but occasionally I got the big one. Like Microsoft buying Skype. It was a hard game to play. It’s even harder now.\n\nA few months ago, I naively asked the founder of a purportedly disruptive company for an interview. I thought it would be a great interview, as he was doing something new and interesting and worth digging into. Obviously, he didn’t respond. He didn’t have to. Maybe he was worried that an old-school reporter like me would do my homework and ask basic, but tough questions. The kind of questions that used to be standard fare, but now they get you ignored.\n\nA hundred years ago, tabloids printed whatever they were told, just to sell rags. Today it’s videos and podcasts. Don’t get me started on the “technology” ones, especially those creaming over “AI.”\n\nPodcasters need guests. To build an audience they chase boldface names. Access depends on avoiding tough questions. Press them with unflattering ones and you get a reputation. No surprise we now have podcasters acting as mouthpieces for tech companies. The “interview” becomes a promotional vehicle. The host lobs softballs and nods along with whatever narrative the guest is spinning. Both lapse into MBA-speak. It’s an Oscar-worthy performance. The line between journalism and marketing blurs.\n\nI don’t think this is an ethical failure; it’s structural. When your business model depends on downloads and views, you do what you must: keep cozy relationships with a small circle of founders, venture capitalists, and executives you’re supposed to cover critically.\n\nAI podcasts are a perfect example. You hear the same talking heads saying the same things. They’re half-bullish, half-skeptical. One side sees transformation, the other disaster. As with any technology, the truth sits somewhere in the middle. What you need is contextual skepticism, technical scrutiny, and analytic rigor. That mix doesn’t exist because the system won’t support it.\n\nThere are fewer than a dozen journalists I can name-check those who don’t disappoint. Nilay Patel of The Verge for example. There are some veterans, but only a handful are newcomers. Good technology coverage needs more.\n\nWhile building GigaOm, I knew we’d drown in pitch meetings without standards. I wrote a one-page guide for my writers covering startups. Beyond taking the time to understand their subject, I asked them to answer four questions before writing about a founder or a startup.\n\nBegin with the founders. Look past LinkedIn summaries to their actual histories. Have they built and shipped real products? Do they understand the market they claim to disrupt? Are they domain experts or opportunists chasing the latest trend? And lastly, as a form of validation, who are their financial backers?\n\nFounders were interesting only if you had enough context about the technology landscape to distinguish the novel from the incremental. You had to know whether their insight was real or just a repackaging of existing ideas with better marketing.\n\nInvestors mattered. With every deal, a firm put its reputation on the line. Their involvement signaled intent. If Sequoia or Kleiner Perkins backed a company, it meant their partners had done due diligence. The amount of capital and the stage said a lot about conviction and risk tolerance.\n\nAssessing the market opportunity amid technology trends was the hardest part and required the most expertise. You needed to understand what was technically possible,, what the market was ready for, how the cost curves looked, andwhere the ecosystem dependencies were.\n\nAll this took time. I spent years watching markets evolve, covering hundreds of companies, and seeing patterns emerge. My understanding of technology grew through conversations with people who built it. Tony Li and Pradeep Sindhu walked me through the secrets of internet routing. From Andy Bechtolsheim and Desh Deshpande, I learned the ins and outs of switching. David Huber, the man behind Ciena, introduced me to optical networks. I learned the technology and, in turn, how to ask the right questions.\n\nI was lucky. Back then, the internet didn’t move at neck-snapping speed.\n\nIn my VC role, I told founders to step back and think about why their stories mattered to anyone but themselves. I encouraged them to build real rather than transactional relationships with journalists, and to wait until they had something genuinely interesting to say instead of treating PR as a checklist.\n\nIt was good advice then, and it still is, in part, as a subset of a new approach. The system I described, where thoughtful storytelling and relationship-building mattered, required time on both sides.\n\nMuch like the rest of media, tech journalism, today relies on writers who lack the deep context to do the work well. They are young, overworked, pushed to churn, and don’t have time to spend weeks learning a market before covering it. You can’t learn on the job while filing three stories a day or recording several podcast episodes a month.\n\nAs I argued in my velocity piece, we now operate on vibes. When a firm like Andreessen Horowitz invests in everything at every stage, what does that signal? A16z’s backing no longer means what Sequoia’s meant in 2005, and a TechCrunch launch no longer means what it did in 2008. The technology ecosystem is noise. Its media outlets are just the outward expression of that noise.\n\nI just read a Bloomberg piece about a startup called Upscale, which claimed it would take on Cisco and Broadcom with AI networking gear. It has raised a truckload of money and is valued in the billions, yet the story never told me the mostbasic thing: what it actually does.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, the bastion of good financial journalism, recently spent many inches on the peccadillos of one of the founders of Thinking Machines. Thinking Machines is an AI company founded by former OpenAI employees and is now valued at $12 billion. The WSJ and a handful of other major publications covered this drama as if it were a story for the Daily Mail or Vanity Fair, yet none of them explained to readers what Thinking Machines does or why it is worth $12 billion. What is its technological edge? You know, the basic financial and technological questions most readers need forcontext.\n\nThis isn’t the first time I’ve seen empty stories dominate. In the late 1990s, the dot-com boom launched a wave of new publications, staffed by new writers. They reported fluff: financings, concepts, hires, and parties. The hard part was covering the technology and the financial realities.\n\nWe built systems that reward acceleration, and we act surprised when everything feels rushed, shallow, a little manic. The algorithm doesn’t care if something is true. It cares if it moves. Nothing moves like titillation, gossip, and startup psychodrama.\n\nTo see what works in this environment, look at Sam Altman and OpenAI.\n\nSam is everywhere. Always in the media, always talking. What matters is that he’s in the conversation. People are talking about OpenAI, about him, about their vision for the future of AI. The objective is to make OpenAI synonymous with AI. Tighten the equation until, in people’s minds, OpenAI equals AI. That constant presence, that relentless visibility, lets him raise money at ungodly valuations. Everything else is tactics.\n\nWhat he says doesn’t have to mean anything; it’s no surprise he’s often self-contradictory.\n\nTake advertising as an example. In a talk at Harvard in October 2024, Sam said, “The idea of intermingling ads and AI is uniquely unsettling to me. I think ads were important to give the early internet a business model, but they do sort of somewhat fundamentally misalign a user’s incentives with the company providing the service. I view ads as a last-resortbusiness model.”\n\nIn fifteen months, he went from “uniquely unsettling” to “hopeful that a business model like this can work,” from “I hate ads” to ads running in ChatGPT. Anyone can connect the dots, but nobody does because the system doesn’t reward it.\n\nThe system rewards the next Sam interview. It seeks the sound bite that gets attention, gets views, picks up speed.Everyone covers Sam’s latest thoughts on AI, the future, and whatever else he wants to talk about that day.\n\nYou hardly see anybody connecting the dots and writing, “Here’s what Sam Altman said about advertising six months ago, here’s what he’s saying now, and here’s what that tells us about OpenAI’s actual business model versus its stated principles.” That story doesn’t get written because it requires someone to remember what was said six months ago, compare it to what is being said today, analyze the gap between rhetoric and reality, and ask why the gap exists and what it means for the company’s actual strategy.\n\nDon’t hate the player, play the game. Like I said, velocity trumps everything.\n\nFebruary 1, 2026, San Francisco",

    "description": "Intelligent technology is allowing organizations to move from episodic transformation to continuous evolution by shrinking the coordination and experimentation costs that once made change slow and risky. Three capabilities underpin this shift: real time visibility into how work actually happens, digital twins that enable rapid experimentation without disrupting operations, and agentic AI systems that execute and adapt workflows. High-fidelity operational models replace simplified assumptions, giving leaders an accurate picture of current processes.

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Smartwatches, Oura rings, smart home devices and Fitbits being weaponised, says Refuge\n\nDomestic abusers are increasingly using AI, smartwatches and other technology to attack and control their victims, a domestic abuse charity says.\n\nRecord numbers of women who were abused and controlled through technology were referred to Refuge’s specialist services during the last three months of 2025, including a 62% increase in the most complex cases to total 829 women. There was also a 24% increase in referrals of under-30s.\n\nRecent cases included perpetrators using wearable tech such as smartwatches, Oura rings and Fitbits to track and stalk women, disrupting their lives through smart home devices that control lights and heating, and using AI spoofing apps to impersonate people.\n\nEmma Pickering, head of the tech-facilitated abuse team at Refuge, said: “Time and again, we see what happens when devices go to market without proper consideration of how they might be used to harm women and girls. It is currently far too easy for perpetrators to access and weaponise smart accessories, and our frontline teams are seeing the devastating consequences of this abuse.\n\n“It is unacceptable for the safety and wellbeing of women and girls to be treated as an afterthought once a technology has been developed and distributed. Their safety must be a foundational principle shaping both the design of wearable technology and the regulatory frameworks that surround it.”\n\nRefuge said it was far too easy to access and weaponise smart accessories and that women’s safety needed to be factored into their design.\n\nOne survivor Refuge worked with, Mina, left behind her smartwatch in a rush to flee her abuser, who then used it to track her by using linked cloud accounts to locate her emergency accommodation.\n\n“[It] was deeply shocking and frightening. I felt suddenly exposed and unsafe, knowing that my location was being tracked without my consent. It created a constant sense of paranoia; I couldn’t relax, sleep properly, or feel settled anywhere because I knew my movements weren’t private,” she said.\n\nDespite police returning the device to Mina, she was located at her next refuge by a private investigator hired by her abuser, using suspected tracking via technology. She reported the breaches to police but was told no crime had been committed because she had “not come to any harm”.\n\n“I was repeatedly asked to move for my safety, rather than the technology being dealt with directly or the smart watch being confiscated from him. Each move made me feel more unstable and displaced,” she said.\n\n“Overall, the experience left me feeling unsafe, unheard, and responsible for managing a situation that was completely out of my control. It showed me how tech abuse can quietly and powerfully extend coercive control, and how easily survivors can be left to carry the emotional and practical burden when systems don’t fully understand or respond to it.”\n\nAbusers were also increasingly using AI tools to manipulate survivors, Pickering said. For example, they might alter a video of the survivor so that she appeared drunk, enabling them to tell social services that “she’s acting erratic again, slurring speech, she’s got a drink problem” and that she was therefore an unfit mother or a risk to herself and others. “We’ll see more and more of that as these videos and applications advance,” Pickering said.\n\nPickering said she had also heard of AI tools being used to develop authentic-looking fraudulent documents, for example job offers or legal summons, which can be sent to survivors to make them believe they are in debt, or to persuade them to turn up to the same location as their abuser.\n\nPickering feared that in coming years, medical tech would increasingly be misused, for example by controlling insulin levels through a diabetes tracker, which can be fatal.\n\nShe urged the government to act on digital technology-enabled and online crimes, including providing more funding to develop and train digital investigations teams. “They want short-term wins, they don’t want to think about longer-term investment in this area, but if we don’t do that we’ll never get ahead,” she said.\n\nShe also wants to see the technology industry held to account for failing to ensure devices and platforms are designed and function in ways that are safe for vulnerable people.\n\n“Ofcom and the Online Safety Act don’t go far enough,” she said.\n\nA government spokesperson said: “Tackling violence against women and girls in all its forms, including when it takes place online or is facilitated by technology, is a top priority for this government.\n\n“Our new VAWG strategy sets out how the full power of the state will be deployed online and offline. We are working with Ofcom to set out how online platforms tackle the disproportionate abuse women and girls face online.”",

    "fullText": "The Institute for Public Policy Research also argues that tech companies must pay publishers for content they use\n\nAI-generated news should carry “nutrition” labels and tech companies must pay publishers for the content they use, according to a left-of-centre thinktank, amid rising use of the technology as a source for current affairs.\n\nThe Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said AI firms were rapidly emerging as the new “gatekeepers” of the internet and intervention was needed to create a healthy AI news environment.\n\nIt recommended standardised labels for AI-generated news, showing what information had been used to create those answers, including peer-reviewed studies and articles from professional news organisations. It also urged the establishment of a licensing regime in the UK allowing publishers to negotiate with tech companies over the use of their content in AI news.\n\n“If AI companies are going to profit from journalism and shape what the public sees, they must be required to pay fairly for the news they use and operate under clear rules that protect plurality, trust and the long-term future of independent journalism,” said Roa Powell, senior research fellow at IPPR and the report’s co-author.\n\nThe IPPR said work on licensing could begin with the UK’s competition regulator using its new enforcement powers over Google. The Competition and Markets Authority this week proposed giving web publishers and news organisations the power to stop Google scraping their content for its overviews. Collective licensing deals would ensure a wide range of publishers were included, the IPPR added.\n\nGoogle’s AI overviews now reach 2 billion users a month and approximately a quarter of people use AI to get information, according to the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.\n\n“With the right policies in place, the government can shape this market so that UK news organisations transition their business models for the AI age and AI companies improve the reliability of their products by drawing on trusted sources,” said the report.\n\nIPPR tested four AI tools – ChatGPT, Google AI overviews, Google Gemini and Perplexity – by entering 100 news-related queries into those platforms and analysing more than 2,500 links produced by the AI responses.\n\nChatGPT and Gemini did not cite journalism by the BBC, which has blocked the bots they use to assemble answers, while overviews and Perplexity used BBC content despite the broadcaster’s objections to those tools using its journalism.\n\nThe IPPR found the Telegraph, GB News, the Sun and the Daily Mail were cited in fewer than 4% of answers on ChatGPT, while the Guardian – which has a licensing deal with ChatGPT’s parent, OpenAI – was used as a source in nearly six out of 10 responses. The Financial Times, which also has a licensing deal with OpenAI, also featured highly. The Guardian was also the most common source used by Gemini, appearing in half of all answers.\n\nGoogle’s use of AI summaries at the top of search results has affected click-through traffic for publishers, with a knock-on effect for their revenues, because many users read the overview without moving on to the original journalism.\n\nThe IPPR said questions needed to be asked about how financial relationships between AI companies and news providers shaped answers.\n\n“If licensed publications appear more prominently in AI answers, there is a risk of locking out smaller and local news providers, who are less likely to get AI deals,” the report said.\n\nIPPR added that while licensing deals could replace lost advertising revenues to an extent, they would not maintain a healthy news ecosystem. They could make news organisations dependent on tech giants for revenue and that income could easily disappear if copyright protections are weakened, said the thinktank.\n\nThe IPPR said there should be public funding to create new business models for investigative news and local news, whose sustainability could be threatened by the rise of AI news, and for the BBC to “innovate with AI”.",

    "fullText": "Lord Stockwood says people in government ‘definitely’ talking about idea as technology disrupts industries\n\nThe UK could introduce a universal basic income (UBI) to protect workers in industries that are being disrupted by AI, the investment minister Jason Stockwood has said.\n\n“Bumpy” changes to society caused by the introduction of the technology would mean there would have to be “some sort of concessionary arrangement with jobs that go immediately”, Lord Stockwood said.\n\nThe Labour peer told the Financial Times: “Undoubtedly we’re going to have to think really carefully about how we soft-land those industries that go away, so some sort of [universal basic income], some sort of lifelong mechanism as well so people can retrain.”\n\nA universal basic income is not part of official government policy, but when asked whether people in government were considering the need for UBI, Stockwood told the FT: “People are definitely talking about it.”\n\nThe technology entrepreneur, who took up his ministerial post in September, said part of his motivation for joining the government was to help ensure the workforce was prepared for rapid change.\n\nFears continue to grow about the impact of artificial intelligence on Britain’s job market. This week research by the investment bank Morgan Stanley found the UK was losing more jobs than it is creating because of AI and was being hit harder than other large economies.\n\nThis month the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said AI could destroy swathes of jobs in the capital and “usher in a new era of mass unemployment”.\n\nLast week, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of the US bank JP Morgan, told the World Economic Forum in Davos that governments and businesses would have to step in to help workers whose roles were displaced by the technology, or risk civil unrest.\n\nStockwood, who held senior positions at Lastminute.com, Travelocity and Match.com, oversaw the $490m (£400m at the time) sale of the online insurance broker Simply Business to the US insurer Travelers in 2017. He later bought a stake the football club of his home town, Grimsby Town FC.\n\nWhile he has previously been a vocal proponent of a wealth tax in the UK, Stockwood told the FT he had not repeated his calls for the government to go further on taxing the rich.\n\nHowever, he added: “If you make your money and the first thing you do is you speak to a tax adviser to ask: ‘Where can we pay the lowest tax?’ we don’t want those people in this country, I’d suggest, because you’re not committed to your communities and the long-term success in this country.”\n\nStockwood was preceded as investment minister by Poppy Gustafsson, a former chief executive of the cybersecurity firm Darktrace, who stepped down after less than a year in the job.",

Although the company initially linked the October layoffs to AI, CEO Andy Jassy later said they were driven more by cultural fit than by cost reductions or automation.\n\nJassy has previously said AI will ultimately reduce Amazon's workforce by driving efficiency gains. On Wednesday, Amazon's chief human resources officer, Beth Galetti, said in the layoff announcement that the company will continue hiring and investing in \"strategic areas.\"\n\nWednesday's layoff was Amazon's second round of mass job cuts since October, when it axed 14,000 roles.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "From phone spyware and facial recognition to phone unlocking technology and databases and more, this tech powers Trump's deportation machine.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said he would make countering immigration one of his flagship policies during his second term in the White House, promising an unprecedented number of deportations.\n\nA year in, data shows that deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection have surpassed at least 350,000 people.\n\nICE has taken center stage in Trump’s mass removal campaign, raiding homes, workplaces, and public parks in search of undocumented people, prompting widespread protests and resistance from communities across the United States.\n\nICE uses several technologies to identify and surveil individuals. Homeland Security has also leveraged the shadow of Trump’s deportations to challenge long-standing legal norms, including forcibly entering homes to arrest people without a judicial warrant, a move that legal experts say violates the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nHere are some of the technologies that ICE is relying on.\n\nICE has a technology known as cell-site simulators to snoop on cellphones. These surveillance devices, as the name suggests, are designed to appear as a cellphone tower, tricking nearby phones into connecting to them. Once that happens, the law enforcement authorities who are using the cell-site simulators can locate and identify the phones in their vicinity, and potentially intercept calls, text messages, and internet traffic.\n\nCell-site simulators are also known as “stingrays,” based on the brand name of one of the earliest versions of the technology, which was made by U.S. defense contractor Harris (now L3Harris); or IMSI catchers, a technology that can capture a nearby cell phone’s unique identifier, which law enforcement can use for identifying the phone’s owner.\n\nIn the last two years, ICE has signed contracts for more than $1.5 million with a company called TechOps Specialty Vehicles (TOSV), which produces customized vans for law enforcement.\n\nA contract worth more than $800,000, dated May 8, 2025, said TOSV will provide “Cell Site Simulator (CSS) Vehicles to support the Homeland Security Technical Operations program.”\n\nTOSV president Jon Brianas told TechCrunch that the company does not manufacture the cell-site simulators, but rather integrates them “into our overall design of the vehicle.”\n\nCell-site simulators have long been controversial for several reasons.\n\nThese devices are designed to trick all nearby phones to connect to them, which means that, by design, they gather the data of many innocent people. Also, authorities have sometimes deployed them without first obtaining a warrant.\n\nAuthorities have also tried to keep their use of the technology secret in court, withholding information and even accepting plea deals and dropping cases rather than disclose information about their use of cell-site simulators. In a court case in 2019 in Baltimore, it was revealed that prosecutors were instructed to drop cases rather than violate a non-disclosure agreement with the company that makes the devices.\n\nClearview AI is perhaps the most well-known facial-recognition company today. For years, the company promised to be able to identify any face by searching through a large database of photos it had scraped from the internet.\n\nOn Monday, 404 Media reported that ICE has signed a contract with the company to support its law enforcement arm, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), “with capabilities of identifying victims and offenders in child sexual exploitation cases and assaults against law enforcement officers.”\n\nAccording to a government procurement database, the contract signed last week is worth $3.75 million.\n\nICE has had other contracts with Clearview AI in the last couple of years. In September 2024, the agency purchased “forensic software” from the company, a deal worth $1.1 million. The year before, ICE paid Clearview AI nearly $800,000 for “facial recognition enterprise licenses.”\n\nClearview AI did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nICE is also using a facial-recognition app called Mobile Fortify, which federal agents use to identify people on the street. The app relies on scanning a person’s driver’s license photo against 200 million photos, much of the data sourced from state driver’s license databases.\n\nIn September 2024, ICE signed a contract worth $2 million with Israeli spyware maker Paragon Solutions. Almost immediately, the Biden administration issued a “stop work order,” putting the contract under review to make sure it complied with an executive order on the government’s use of commercial spyware.\n\nBecause of that order, for nearly a year, the contract remained in limbo. Then, last week, the Trump administration lifted the stop-work order, effectively reactivating the contract.\n\nAt this point, the status of Paragon’s relationship with ICE in practice is unclear.\n\nThe records entry from last week said that the contract with Paragon is for “a fully configured proprietary solution including license, hardware, warranty, maintenance, and training.” Practically speaking, unless the hardware installation and training were done last year, it may take some time for ICE to have Paragon’s system up and running.\n\nIt’s also unclear if the spyware will be used by ICE or HSI, an agency whose investigations are not limited to immigration, but also cover online child sexual exploitation, human trafficking, financial fraud, and more.\n\nParagon has long tried to portray itself as an “ethical” and responsible spyware maker, and now has to decide if it’s ethical to work with Trump’s ICE. A lot has happened to Paragon in the last year. In December, American private equity giant AE Industrial purchased Paragon, with a plan to merge it with cybersecurity company RedLattice, according to Israeli tech news site Calcalist.\n\nIn a sign that the merger may have taken place, when TechCrunch reached out to Paragon for comment on the reactivation of the ICE contract last week, we were referred to RedLattice’s new vice president of marketing and communications, Jennifer Iras.\n\nRedLattice’s Iras did not respond to a request for comment for this article, nor for last week’s article.\n\nIn the last few months, Paragon has been ensnared in a spyware scandal in Italy, where the government has been accused of spying on journalists and immigration activists. In response, Paragon cut ties with Italy’s intelligence agencies.\n\nIn mid-September, ICE’s law enforcement arm, Homeland Security Investigations, signed a contract with Magnet Forensics for $3 million.\n\nThis contract is specifically for software licenses so that HSI agents can “recover digital evidence, process multiple devices,” and “generate forensic reports,” according to the contract description.\n\nMagnet is the current maker of the phone hacking and unlocking devices known as Graykey. These devices essentially give law enforcement agents the ability to connect a locked phone to them, unlock it, and access the data inside of it.\n\nMagnet Forensics, which merged with Graykey maker Grayshift in 2023, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAt the end of September, 404 Media reported that ICE bought access to an “all-in-one” surveillance tool that allows the agency to search through databases of historical cellphone location data, as well as social media information.\n\nThe tool appears to be made of two products called Tangles and Webloc, which are made by a company called Penlink. One of the tools promises to leverage “a proprietary data platform to compile, process, and validate billions of daily location signals from hundreds of millions of mobile devices, providing both forensic and predictive analytics,” according to a redacted contract found by 404 Media.\n\nThe redacted contract does not identify which one of the tools makes that promise, but given its description, it’s likely Webloc. Forbes previously cited a case study that said Webloc can search a given location to “monitor trends of mobile devices that have given data at those locations and how often they have been there.”\n\nThis type of cellphone location data is harvested by companies around the world using software development kits (SDKs) embedded in regular smartphone apps, or with an online advertising process called real-time bidding (RTB), where companies bid in real-time to place an ad on the screen of a cellphone user based on their demographic or location data. The latter process has the by-product of giving ad tech companies that kind of personal data.\n\nOnce collected, this mass of location data is transferred to a data broker who then sells it to government agencies. Thanks to this layered process, authorities have used this type of data without getting a warrant by simply purchasing access to the data.\n\nThe other tool, Tangles, is an “AI-powered open-source intelligence” tool that automates “the search and analysis of data from the open, deep, and the dark web,” according to Penlink’s official site.\n\nForbes reported in September that ICE spent $5 million on Penlink’s two tools.\n\nPenlink did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nICE relies on automated license plate reader (ALPR) companies to follow drivers across a large swath of the U.S., noting where people go and when.\n\nICE also leans on its connections with local law enforcement agencies, which have contracts with ALPR providers, like surveillance company Flock Safety, to obtain immigration data by the back door. Flock is one of the largest ALPR providers, with over 40,000 license plate scanners around the United States, and only getting larger with its partnerships with other companies, such as video surveillance company Ring.\n\nEfforts by ICE to informally request data from local law enforcement have prompted some police departments to cut off federal agencies from their access.\n\nBorder Patrol runs its own surveillance network of ALPR cameras, the Associated Press reported.\n\nFor years, ICE has used the legal research and public records data broker LexisNexis to support its investigations.\n\nIn 2022, two non-profits obtained documents via Freedom of Information Act requests, which revealed that ICE performed more than 1.2 million searches over seven months using a tool called Accurint Virtual Crime Center. ICE used the tool to check the background information of migrants.\n\nA year later, The Intercept revealed that ICE was using LexisNexis to detect suspicious activity and investigate migrants before they even committed a crime, a program that a critic said enabled “mass surveillance.”\n\nAccording to public records, LexisNexis currently provides ICE “with a law enforcement investigative database subscription (LEIDS) which allows access to public records and commercial data to support criminal investigations.”\n\nThis year, ICE has paid $4.7 million to \n\nLexisNexis spokesperson Jennifer Richman told TechCrunch that ICE has used the company’s product “data and analytics solutions for decades, across several administrations.”\n\n“Our commitment is to support the responsible and ethical use of data, in full compliance with laws and regulations, and for the protection of all residents of the United States,” said Richman, who added that LexisNexis “partners with more than 7,500 federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial agencies across the United States to advance public safety and security.”\n\nData analytics and surveillance technology giant Palantir has signed several contracts with ICE in the last year. The biggest contract, worth $18.5 million from September 2024, is for a database system called “Investigative Case Management,” or ICM.\n\nThe contract for ICM goes back to 2022, when Palantir signed a $95.9 million deal with ICE. The Peter Thiel-founded company’s relationship with ICE dates back to the early 2010s.\n\nEarlier this year, 404 Media, which has reported extensively on the technology powering Trump’s deportation efforts, and particularly Palantir’s relationship with ICE, revealed details of how the ICM database works. The tech news site reported that it saw a recent version of the database, which allows ICE to filter people based on their immigration status, physical characteristics, criminal affiliation, location data, and more.\n\nAccording to 404 Media, “a source familiar with the database” said it is made up of ‘tables upon tables’ of data and that it can build reports that show, for example, people who are on a specific type of visa who came into the country at a specific port of entry, who came from a specific country, and who have a specific hair color (or any number of hundreds of data points).”\n\nThe tool, and Palantir’s relationship with ICE, was controversial enough that sources within the company leaked to 404 Media an internal wiki where Palantir justifies working with Trump’s ICE.\n\nPalantir is also developing a tool called “ImmigrationOS,” according to a contract worth $30 million revealed by Business Insider.\n\nImmigrationOS is said to be designed to streamline the “selection and apprehension operations of illegal aliens,” give “near real-time visibility” into self-deportations, and track people overstaying their visa, according to a document first reported on by Wired.\n\nFirst published on September 13, 2025, and updated on September 18, 2025, to include Magnet Forensics’ new contract, again on October 8, 2025, to include cell-site simulators and location data, and again on January 26, 2026, to include license plate readers.",

    "fullText": "Mobile Fortify app being used to scan faces of citizens and immigrants – but its use has prompted a severe backlash\n\nImmigration enforcement agents across the US are increasingly relying on a new smartphone app with facial recognition technology.\n\nThe app is named Mobile Fortify. Simply pointing a phone’s camera at their intended target and scanning the person’s face allows Mobile Fortify to pull data on an individual from multiple federal and state databases, some of which federal courts have deemed too inaccurate for arrest warrants.\n\nThe US Department of Homeland Security has used Mobile Fortify to scan faces and fingerprints in the field more than 100,000 times, according to a lawsuit brought by Illinois and Chicago against the federal agency, earlier this month. That’s a drastic shift from immigration enforcement’s earlier use of facial recognition technology, which was otherwise limited largely to investigations and ports of entry and exit, legal experts say.\n\nThe app’s existence was first uncovered last summer by 404 Media, through leaked emails. 404 Media also reported, in October, about internal DHS documents that say people cannot refuse to be scanned by Mobile Fortify.\n\n“Here we have ICE using this technology in exactly the confluence of conditions that lead to the highest false match rates,” says Nathan Freed Wessler, deputy director of the ACLU’s speech, privacy and technology project. “A false result from this technology can turn somebody’s life totally upside down.” The larger implications for democracy are chilling, too, he notes: “ICE is effectively trying to create a biometric checkpoint society.”\n\nUse of the app has inspired backlash on the streets, in courts, and on Capitol Hill.\n\nProtesters are using a variety of tactics to fight back. They include recording masked agents, using burner phones and donated dashboard cameras, according to the Washington Post.\n\nUnderpinning resistance to ICE’s use of facial recognition are doubts about the technology’s efficacy. Research has uncovered higher error rates in identifying women and people of color than for scans of white faces. ICE’s use of the technology is often occurring in intense and fast-moving situations, which makes misidentification more likely. Those being scanned may be people of color. They could be turning away from officers because they don’t want to be identified. The lighting could be poor.\n\nThe Illinois lawsuit against the DHS takes particular issue with the federal agency’s use of Mobile Fortify and argued that the app goes far beyond what Congress allows with regards to the collection of biometric data. The complaint cited several examples in which federal agents appeared to take photos or scans of US citizens across Illinois without their consent.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers in Congress introduced a bill on 15 January that would outright ban the homeland security department from using Mobile Fortify or similar apps, except for identification at points of entry. This follows a September letter, sent by senators to ICE, asking \n\nThe DHS said in a statement that Mobile Fortify does not violate constitutional rights or compromise privacy. “It operates with a deliberately high matching threshold and queries only limited CBP immigration datasets. The application does not access open-source material, scrape social media, or rely on publicly available data,” a spokesperson said.\n\nAccording to 404 Media, the app’s database consists of some 200m images. “Mobile Fortify has not been blocked, restricted, or curtailed by the courts or by legal guidance. It is lawfully used nationwide in accordance with all applicable legal authorities.”\n\nObservers, experts, and at least one congressman have said federal immigration agents frequently do not ask for consent to scan a person’s face – and may dismiss other documentation that contradicts this data. ICE has been documented using biometrics as a definitive determination of someone’s citizenship in the absence of identification.\n\nThis means that ICE is not required to conduct additional vetting of facial scans or checks to avoid a misidentification. 404 Media reported earlier this month that Mobile Fortify misidentified a detained woman during an immigration raid; the app came up with two different and incorrect names.\n\n“Facial recognition – to the extent it should be used at all – is really supposed to be a starting point,” says Jake Laperruque, deputy director of the security and surveillance project at the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT). “If you treat this as an endpoint – as a definitive ID – you’re going to have errors, and you’re going to end up arresting and jailing people that are not actually who the machine says it is.”\n\nLaperruque says that even police departments across the country have pushed back against an over-reliance on facial recognition, treating it as a lead, at most. At least 15 states are cautious about using it all, and have laws limiting police’s use of the technology. In 2019, San Francisco became the first major US city to ban facial recognition technology by police and all other local government agencies.\n\nThe DHS issued a directive in September 2023 requiring that the bureau test the technology for unintended bias and offer US citizens the choice to opt out of scans not conducted by law enforcement. That directive appeared to be rescinded in February last year.\n\nICE’s stops – whether they involve face-scanning or not – have been subject to litigation as well. They have often been referred to as “Kavanaugh stops” after the supreme court justice wrote in a concurring opinion that Hispanic residents’ “apparent ethnicity” can be a “relevant factor” for ICE to stop them and demand for proof of citizenship. The ACLU sued the Trump administration earlier this month, accusing federal immigration authorities of racial profiling and unlawful arrests.",

    "fullText": "Free and fast in-flight WiFi could be available on every plane within five years, according to the airline boss who argued with Elon Musk over Starlink.\n\n\"I think as the WiFi technology improves over the next four or five years, we'll all be offering free WiFi access,\" Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said during an earnings call on Monday.\n\n\"Customers will use it if it's free, but if they have to pay for it, they won't use it.\"\n\nThe Irish budget airline is known for its no-frills offering and dedication to keeping costs low. In the last quarter, it had an average airfare of 44 euros — about $52 — while reporting after-tax profits of 115 million euros ($137 million) before an exceptional charge for a fine.\n\nIn recent months, many airlines have signed deals with Starlink, which can provide in-flight internet speeds of over 200 Mbps — faster than many home WiFi connections.\n\nHowever, for Ryanair and O'Leary, cheap tickets are more important for winning customers.\n\n\"I have no doubt in my mind that a low fare will beat free WiFi on board every single time,\" the CEO told investors.\n\nHis weeklong quarrel with Musk was sparked by questions about the extra fuel costs incurred by installing a Starlink terminal on an airplane.\n\nO'Leary said the aerodynamic drag would lead to a 2% increase, costing over $200 million a year and raising ticket prices. However, a SpaceX executive said in an X post that the increase was only 0.3%.\n\nEither way, O'Leary said on Monday, any extra fuel costs would be unacceptable.\n\nHe said that Ryanair would add in-flight WiFI \"in a heartbeat\" if the technology improves so that antennae don't need to be installed outside an airplane's fuselage.\n\nO'Leary suggested that, in the next few years, such antennae could instead be installed in the hold.\n\nRyanair is continuing discussions with Starlink, Amazon, and the British telecoms firm Vodafone, he said.\n\nSome of these operators believe that at least half of passengers would pay for in-flight WiFi, O'Leary said on the call, but he thinks no more than 10% would do so.\n\nEvery Starlink-airline deal so far has included free access for all passengers, although many mandate signing up for loyalty programs.\n\nRyanair's spat with Musk also garnered \"lots of free publicity,\" O'Leary said. The outspoken boss and the airline's social media team are known for making provocative comments to get attention.\n\nThe airline's press conference last week, promoting a sale in the wake of the argument, was covered by some 1,500 news articles across nearly 60 countries, O'Leary said on the call.",

    "fullText": "Synthesia makes digital presenters for clients to use in corporate videos and counts 70% of FTSE 100 as customers\n\nA British AI startup that makes realistic video avatars has almost doubled its valuation to $4bn (£3bn), in a boost for the UK technology sector.\n\nSynthesia was valued at $2.1bn last year and moved into new offices in central London, marking the moment with a ceremony attended by the Sadiq Khan, the city’s mayor, and Peter Kyle, then technology secretary.\n\nOn Monday, it announced its latest funding round, led by an existing investor, Google Ventures, had raised $200m and valued the British company at $4bn. Google Ventures is the search firm’s venture capital arm.\n\nSynthesia uses human actors to generate digital avatars of people and also offers employers the ability to create replicas of their staff. Those avatars are then deployed by organisations in corporate videos in a range of scenarios such as health and safety in the workplace, advising on cybersecurity and how to communicate better at work.\n\nThe company counts 70% of the FTSE 100 as clients, including NatWest, Lloyds Bank and British Gas. It is also used by non-corporate bodies including the NHS, the European Commission and the United Nations.\n\nThe startup is also developing new avatars that will help train employees and give them new skills, through scenarios such as role-playing and giving tailored explanations.\n\nSynthesia’s co-founder, Steffen Tjerrild, said the increased valuation reflected the commitment of the company’s longstanding backers rather than the investment hype surrounding the AI sector. “Existing investors have seen the progress, have seen the numbers, have seen them compound year over year,” he said. “That is also telling a story that this is less [a case of] external investors trying to kind of hype it up, but more about validation from existing investors as well.”\n\nLast year, a leading British tech investor, James Anderson, said he found sharp increases in valuations of AI startups such as OpenAI and Anthropic “disconcerting”. Tjerrild said Synthesia was focusing on executing its business plan, which, he added, was backed by investors who were long-term supporters.\n\n“This round is led by insiders, or predominantly existing investors that deeply understand the business, have seen the execution and the improvement of the business over many years,” he said.\n\nSynthesia generated revenues of $58.3m in 2024 but made a pre-tax loss of $59.2m, according to its latest published accounts, which the company said reflected its investment in headcount, its technology and new offices. Synthesia said it was on track to make $200m in revenues this year.\n\nThe $4bn valuation puts the company on a par with UK broadcaster ITV, which is worth £3.1bn. Tjerrild’s shareholding in Synthesia is now worth $160m, the same as its chief executive and fellow co-founder, Victor Riparbelli.\n\nSynthesia was founded in 2017 by the two Danish nationals, as well as the computer scientists Matthias Niessner and Lourdes Agapito.\n\nLast year, the London mayor said Synthesia was doing “incredibly well” as he opened its new offices. However, in a speech this month Khan said AI would “usher in a new era of mass unemployment” if used recklessly, as intelligent, autonomous systems proved cheap replacements for humans.\n\nTjerrild said he believed AI would enable businesses to hire more staff. “We’re an AI-first company, we have 600 employees and we hired 40% more people last year,” he said. “As a business owner myself, if my employees become more productive that means I can invest and hire more people.",

    "description": "Val Sopi left his service company to pursue recurring revenue. Now, his first SaaS is at a 5-figure ARR. Here's how he did it.",
    "fullText": "Val Sopi left a successful service company in order to access stable, recurring revenue.\n\nHis first attempt, BlogMaker, started as a challenge to create a product in 20 hours. Now, it's at a 5-figure ARR.\n\nHere's Val on how he did it. 👇\n\nI'm a graphic designer by education, and a developer and marketer by trade. I wear many hats and enjoy jumping from product to sales on a daily basis.\n\nInitially, I ran a successful web shop serving larger organizations and non-profits with bespoke web applications. But I wanted to build SaaS products to create more stable and predictable revenue streams — and to offer the potential to exit at some point.\n\nBlogMaker.app began as a personal challenge. I wanted to test my limits and launch a fully working product within 20 hours. This was back in April 2021, when we hand-coded everything — no vibe coding or AI involved.\n\nSo, I built a blog engine for small teams and solo founders who want to publish for SEO purposes. I went full time on it in October 2022, after noticing positive traction and retention. It's currently a 5–figure ARR business with 50% month–to–month growth.\n\nThe initial version took about 20 hours, as I mentioned. That was split into about 3 sessions. I had a working product and payment from a customer right after launch.\n\nSince those early days, BlogMaker has gone through hundreds of updates.\n\nI work with a highly customized forked version of CodeIgniter3 for the backend and jQuery for the front. It's my favorite combo for shipping fast. And I work with zero external libraries to reduce the overhead of constantly upgrading various dependencies.\n\nSince I run solo, I keep that to a minimum.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges I faced was unlocking a distribution channel that consistently delivered. I haven't completely overcome that challenge.\n\nInitially, I told everyone I knew in all my circles: Twitter, Slack, even offline meetups.\n\nI'm still super active on Twitter, but it doesn't bring in new customers. I mostly share lessons and my journey with my online friends. My user base doesn't overlap much.\n\nThese days, I focus on SEO and AEO because they are the most viable intent-based approaches to growth.\n\nSEO initially feels like a slog, but it's amazing how quickly you can rank with even short articles that answer a simple question — a strategy AI also relies on.\n\nSo, I run two blogs. One covers feature updates and product news. The other is about SEO strategy, and it's where I publish \"vs\" and \"alternative to\" posts, as well as \"how-to\" articles based on questions people search for.\n\nOther than that, I produce videos about the product, new features, demos, and other content that resonates with my target audience. I also update the guide, change website copy, build relationships and partnerships, and sometimes do cold outreach.\n\nA good example is a recent partnership with RightBlogger.com, which directly integrates with BlogMaker and helps customers write highly comprehensive SEO articles with AI.\n\nInitially, BlogMaker offered only yearly prices; while good for clients, this made building a sustainable business difficult. I transitioned to monthly pricing, but that proved challenging because the brand was previously positioned and consistently marketed with yearly pricing. Consequently, signups expected yearly pricing and did not convert.\n\nHowever, recently, monthly recurring revenue (MRR) has almost overtaken all previous MRR from yearly subscriptions, proving again that a monthly subscription model offers a sustainable approach for a growing business.\n\nIncreasing prices also had a positive impact on revenue, but I never increased prices for existing clients. Instead, I offered them a way to gracefully upgrade to newer plans and features.\n\nIn this journey, I've realized that taking care of myself is paramount to my product's success.\n\nWhen I started building SaaS products, I would go days without much physical activity because building and growing a product would suck me in. But that quickly backfired and eventually led me to a burnout circa 2020, which was not fun to experience.\n\nNow, I try to balance myself, even though I can still outwork anyone on the planet!\n\nThat means I try to get 7K steps per day. I also go to the gym at least four times a week to lift weights. Whenever I feel off, lifting weights is my escape.\n\nI also meditate. It helps me become more patient and focused. It also helps better observe myself and detach from my thoughts, which often stem from my environment, upbringing, etc. Distinguishing between beneficial and detrimental thoughts has been a game changer.\n\nI see a ton of early-stage indie hackers focusing on the product first. This is highly risky because you don't know if many people experience the problem you're trying to solve regularly.\n\nWhile \"scratching your own itch\" can be a good approach, it requires significant luck to succeed; many other people must share your specific need.\n\nI now highly recommend looking for what people buy (the product), what types of customers buy it (potentially business people), and how they find the product (channels and distribution).\n\nOther criteria include why you are the right person to build such a thing (and if not, how you can become that person), and your unfair go-to-market advantage.\n\nMy immediate goals for BlogMaker are to grow it to a 5-figure MRR business with at least 80% in profits. Long-term, I plan to continue iterating based on the latest technologies and customer requirements.\n\nThe world of SEO, now with AI, is moving fast, and I want BlogMaker to be at the front of it all.\n\nI also recently started another product, AMSDeck.com, geared towards bigger organizations. This product came from extensive research, based on Rob Walling's teachings, particularly his most recent course, which I highly recommend: The SaaS Launchpad. You cannot skim this course; it demands dedication and offers significant rewards.\n\nYou can follow along on my podcast and I occasionally blog at valsopi.com. The holding company of one that produced BlogMaker, AMSDeck, and other products is Handmade Spaceships, Inc.",

    "fullText": "Kristalina Georgieva says research suggests 60% of jobs in advanced economies will be affected, with many entry-level roles wiped out\n\nArtificial intelligence will be a “tsunami hitting the labour market”, with young people worst affected, the head of the International Monetary Fund warned the World Economic Forum on Friday.\n\nKristalina Georgieva told delegates in Davos that the IMF’s own research suggested there would be a big transformation of demand for skills, as the technology becomes increasingly widespread.\n\n“We expect over the next years, in advanced economies, 60% of jobs to be affected by AI, either enhanced or eliminated or transformed – 40% globally,” she said. “This is like a tsunami hitting the labour market.”\n\nShe suggested that in advanced economies, one in 10 jobs had already been “enhanced” by AI, tending to boost these workers’ pay, with knock-on benefits for the local economy.\n\nMeanwhile people whose jobs were not directly changed by artificial intelligence risked being squeezed, she said, with their pay potentially falling without a productivity boost from AI.\n\n“So the middle class, inevitably, is going to be affected,” Georgieva predicted.\n\nShe said her greatest fear was that AI was insufficiently regulated. “This is moving so fast, and yet we don’t know how to make it safe. We don’t know how to make it inclusive. Wake up, AI is for real, and it is transforming our world faster than we are getting ahead of it,” she said.\n\nMuch of the debate at the annual meeting of the business and political elite in the Swiss ski resort this week has been hijacked by Donald Trump’s on-off tariff threats over the future of Greenland.\n\nBut many delegates were also keen to highlight the risks and benefits of AI. Christy Hoffman, general secretary of the UNI global union, told the Guardian: “It’s just a basic premise that the point of AI, on the business side, is to increase productivity, therefore lower costs – which will be cutting jobs.”\n\n“I think it’s time to come to terms with that disruption – and how to manage that disruption,” she said, calling for the productivity benefits to be distributed fairly across the economy.\n\n“We want to share in the gains. We’re not going to stop AI, nor do we want to even try – but we don’t want it to just roll over us.” She called on employers to discuss the role of AI tools with workers and their representatives before introducing them.\n\nEarlier in the week at Davos, the Microsoft chief executive, Satya Nadella, warned that AI could lose its “social permission” to compete for resources such as energy, for example, if it failed to generate benefits beyond a few powerful tech firms – such as the rapid development of effective new drugs.\n\nGeorgieva was speaking on a panel alongside the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, who warned that the AI boom could be hampered by growing mistrust between rival economies, as the US throws up tariff barriers.\n\n“We are dependent on each other,” she said, pointing out that AI was capital intensive, energy intensive and data intensive. If countries did not work cooperatively and “define the new rules of the game,” she said, there would be less capital and less data. “We are in a bind, lets face it,” she said.\n\nLagarde also sounded the alarm about widening global inequality, highlighting the “disparity that is getting deeper and bigger”.\n\nEarlier in the week at Davos, the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, urged delegates to face up to a permanent “rupture” in the global economic order, and band together in the face of erratic US trade policy.\n\nBut Lagarde said she was less gloomy. “I’m not exactly on the same page as Mark,” she said. “I’m not sure that we should be talking about rupture. I think we should be talking about alternatives.”",

    "fullText": "Misinformation technology could be deployed at scale to disrupt 2028 US presidential election, AI researchers say\n\nPolitical leaders could soon launch swarms of human-imitating AI agents to reshape public opinion in a way that threatens to undermine democracy, a high profile group of experts in AI and online misinformation has warned.\n\nThe Nobel peace prize-winning free-speech activist Maria Ressa, and leading AI and social science researchers from Berkeley, Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge and Yale are among a global consortium flagging the new “disruptive threat” posed by hard-to-detect, malicious “AI swarms” infesting social media and messaging channels.\n\nA would-be autocrat could use such swarms to persuade populations to accept cancelled elections or overturn results, they said, amid predictions the technology could be deployed at scale by the time of the US presidential election in 2028.\n\nThe warnings, published today in Science, come alongside calls for coordinated global action to counter the risk, including “swarm scanners” and watermarked content to counter AI-run misinformation campaigns. Early versions of AI-powered influence operations have been used in the 2024 elections in Taiwan, India and Indonesia.\n\n“A disruptive threat is emerging: swarms of collaborative, malicious AI agents,” the authors said. “These systems are capable of coordinating autonomously, infiltrating communities and fabricating consensus efficiently. By adaptively mimicking human social dynamics, they threaten democracy.”\n\nOne leading expert in propaganda technology, Inga Trauthig, said the adoption of such advanced technology is likely to be slowed by politicians’ reluctance to cede campaign control to AIs. Another cause for skepticism is concern that using such illicit techniques would not be worth the risk, given voters are still more influenced by offline material.\n\nThe experts behind the warning include New York University’s Gary Marcus, a prominent sceptic about the claimed potential of current AI models who calls himself a “generative AI realist”, and Audrey Tang, Taiwan’s first digital minister, who has warned: “Those in the pay of authoritarian forces are undermining electoral processes, weaponizing AI and employing our societal strengths against us.”\n\nOthers include David Garcia, professor for social and behavioural data science at the University of Konstanz, Sander van der Linden, a misinformation expert and director of Cambridge University’s social decision-making lab, and Christopher Summerfield, AI researcher and professor of cognitive neuroscience at Oxford University.\n\nTogether they say political leaders could deploy almost limitless numbers of AIs to masquerade as humans online and precisely infiltrate communities, learn their foibles over time and use increasingly convincing and carefully tailored falsehoods, to change population-wide opinions.\n\nThe threat is being supercharged by advances in AIs’ ability to pick up on the tone and content of discourse. They are increasingly able to mimic human dynamics, for example, by using appropriate slang and posting irregularly to avoid detection. Progress in the development of “agentic” AI also means the ability to autonomously plan and coordinate action.\n\nAs well as operating across social media, they may use messaging channels and even write blogs or use email, depending on which channel the AI thinks best helps achieve an aim, said one of the authors, Daniel Thilo Schroeder, a research scientist at the Sintef research institute in Oslo.\n\n“It’s just frightening how easy these things are to vibe code and just have small bot armies that can actually navigate online social media platforms and email and use these tools,” said Schroeder, who has been simulating swarms in laboratory conditions.\n\nAnother of the authors, Jonas Kunst, professor of communication at the BI Norwegian Business School, said: “If these bots start to evolve into a collective and exchange information to solve a problem – in this case a malicious goal, namely analysing a community and finding a weak spot – then coordination will increase their accuracy and efficiency.\n\n“That is a really serious threat that we predict is going to materialise.”\n\nIn Taiwan, where voters are regularly targeted by Chinese propaganda, often unknowingly, AI bots have been increasing engagement with citizens on Threads and Facebook in the last two to three months, said Puma Shen, a Taiwanese Democratic Progressive Party MP and campaigner against Chinese disinformation.\n\nDuring discussions on political topics the AIs tend to provide “tonnes of information that you cannot verify”, creating “information overload”, Shen said. He said AIs might cite fake articles about how America will abandon Taiwan. Another recent trend is for the AI bots to stress to younger Taiwanese people that the China-Taiwan dispute is very complicated “so do not take sides if you have no knowledge”.\n\n“It’s not telling you that China’s great, but it’s [encouraging them] to be neutral,” Shen told the Guardian. “This is very dangerous, because then you think people like me are radical.”\n\nAmid signs the progress of AI technology is not as rapid as Silicon Valley companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have claimed, the Guardian asked independent AI experts to assess the swarm warnings.\n\n“In the election-heavy year of 2024 the capabilities were there for AI-driven microtargeting but we didn’t see as much of that as scholars predicted,” said Trauthig, an adviser to the International Panel on the Information Environment. “Most political propagandists I interview are still using older technologies and are not at this cutting edge.”\n\n“It isn’t fanciful,” said Michael Wooldridge, professor of the foundations of AI at Oxford University. “I think it is entirely plausible that bad actors will try to mobilise virtual armies of LLM-powered agents to disrupt elections and manipulate public opinion, for example targeting large numbers of individuals on social media and other electronic media. It’s technologically perfectly feasible … the technology has got progressively better and much more accessible.”\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "fullText": "Growing concerns about the impact of smartphones on the youngest children must be addressed\n\nThe first UK government guidance on young children’s use of tablets, smartphones and other screens, expected in April, cannot come soon enough. The laissez-faire approach to the boom in social media, handheld devices and other digital technology was arguably nowhere less suitable than when such machines were placed in front of babies. The Department for Education’s ongoing Children of the 2020s study has found that 98% of two-year-olds watch screens on a typical day for more than two hours. Those who spent the most time had smaller vocabularies, and were twice as likely as other children to show signs of emotional and behavioural difficulties.\n\nCorrelation must not be mistaken for causation. This is still a relatively new area of research, and much remains uncertain. But the findings of a recent survey by the charity Kindred Squared, combined with observations by teachers, are highly concerning. Answers from 1,000 primary-school staff revealed that 37% of four-year-olds arrived without basic life skills such as dressing and eating in 2025 – up from 33% two years earlier.\n\nSome of these may have additional needs. And there is no suggestion from the charity that screens are the only issue. Stresses caused by the high cost of living, cuts to local early years services and other factors affect the quality of the youngest children’s lives. But many teachers, along with one of their unions, the NASUWT, believe that the impact of screens must be addressed, with parents as well as children encouraged to prioritise books and bricks over swipes and clicks.\n\nThe World Health Organization recommends that children under two should not use screens at all. But even if such prohibitions are unlikely to be heeded by the majority, ministers could be more ambitious in making the case for a precautionary approach. The importance of early speech, communication and emotional development should be clearly explained, and parents given support when they need it.\n\nSince global outrage was sparked earlier this month by nudification on Grok, and the ease with which such images could be shared on X, the debate around regulation has dramatically shifted. Over recent days, Kemi Badenoch has thrown her party’s weight behind an age limit of 16 for social media apps, following Australia’s example. With a number of Labour MPs sympathetic, the government is under pressure to agree.\n\nThose pushing for tougher rules are right that existing regulations are full of holes. Age verification should have been introduced sooner. Addictive features should never have been allowed on children’s accounts. But in the rush to gain political advantage from the current spike in concern, there is a risk of issues becoming confused. When considering screens and preschool children, a key question is what other activities (books, toys, ballgames) are being replaced, and why this matters. Weighing the impact of social media and smartphones on teenagers involves different calculations. Nudification apps are a distinct problem. It could be argued that the new focus on under-16s risks distracting attention from the more general danger posed by sexually explicit AI-generated material.\n\nOfcom’s prompt response to the Grok/X nudification outcry was welcome. Politicians and campaigners may be right that under-16s’ social media use should be restricted. Warnings about screens and toddlers should be heeded. The wider message of the past few weeks is that democratic oversight of the tech industry needs to accelerate.\n\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "fullText": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he has offered to license Full Self-Driving to other automakers.\n\nCompanies like Ford and Rivian announced in recent weeks that they'll pursue self-driving in-house.\n\nNvidia also released a toolkit that lowers the barrier to entry for pursuing autonomy.\n\nElon Musk has called legacy automakers' hesitancy to license Tesla's Full Self-Driving software \"crazy,\" but a slew of industry moves show that their reluctance is strategic.\n\nIn recent weeks, more automakers have released roadmaps to build key pieces of automated driving software rather than outsourcing the technology. Because automakers see vehicle tech as a brand-defining component, a Tesla license can become a hard sell.\n\nRivian, for example, is going deeper into vertical integration by designing a proprietary chip for the brain behind the company's autonomous driving computer. CEO RJ Scaringe even broached the idea of pursuing a robotaxi business at Rivian's Autonomy & AI Day in early December.\n\nLegacy automakers aren't taking the same ambitious route of designing custom chips, but they have begun to seek in-house solutions.\n\nFord announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that it plans to develop eyes-off driving software for public roads by 2028. The company said going in-house cuts costs by 30% and provides more control over how the software is integrated and deployed.\n\n\"To integrate, I can't do this with all these suppliers,\" Paul Costa, Ford's head of electrical engineering, told Business Insider. \"We need to bring this stuff in-house, and it allows for this ability to do the trifecta at once: smaller, cheaper, and higher performance.\"\n\nMusk said in a X post in November that it was \"crazy\" that legacy automakers didn't want to license Tesla FSD, an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that the EV maker has said will enable fully autonomous driving.\n\n\"When legacy auto does occasionally reach out, they tepidly discuss implementing FSD for a tiny program in 5 years with unworkable requirements for Tesla, so pointless,\" Musk said in the post.\n\nMusk didn't specify what those requirements were. A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nExperts who track the software side of the automotive industry told Business Insider there's a practical reason to go in-house, even if there are near-term challenges.\n\nChris Ahn, a principal at Deloitte who consults for key automakers, told Business Insider that companies have to decide what level of autonomy their customer base will want and how to achieve it, like using lidar or using a cameras-only system.",

    "description": "Tesla boss clashed with Michael O’Leary when airline boss rejected installing Starlink technology on...",
    "fullText": "Tesla boss clashed with Michael O’Leary when airline boss rejected installing Starlink technology on aircraft\n\nElon Musk has floated the idea of buying the budget airline Ryanair, escalating his public spat with the Irish carrier’s boss, Michael O’Leary.\n\nThe two outspoken businessmen have locked horns since last week, when O’Leary was asked whether he would follow Lufthansa and British Airways in installing Musk’s Starlink satellite internet technology on his fleet of 650 aircraft.\n\nThe Ryanair chief executive rejected the idea, saying that adding antennas to the jets would result in “2% fuel drag”, adding an extra $200m-$250m to its $5bn (£3.71bn) annual kerosene bill.\n\nMusk said that interpretation was “misinformed” in a post on his X platform, prompting a tit-for-tat exchange of insults, with each calling the other an “idiot” and then the Tesla and SpaceX CEO saying O’Leary should be fired.\n\nOn Friday, the world’s richest person asked his followers on X whether he should buy Europe’s biggest airline, which is valued at €30bn (£26bn), posting: “Should I buy Ryan Air and put someone whose actual name is Ryan in charge?”\n\nHe followed it up with a poll asking whether he should “Buy Ryan Air and restore Ryan as their rightful ruler”. More than three-quarters of the nearly 900,000 respondents said yes, three hours before the poll closed. Tony Ryan, the Irish billionaire businessman who co-founded the budget airline in 1984, died in 2007.\n\nRyanair’s X account also mocked Musk, posting in response to an X outage across the US last week: “Perhaps you need Wi-Fi @elonmusk?”\n\nMusk wrote in a reply to a post from the airline teasing him: “How much would it cost to buy you?”\n\nAll this may look like idle talk, but the billionaire has followed through on such threats before. In a social media exchange in 2017 he tweeted that he loved Twitter and when a journalist suggested he should buy it, Musk replied: “How much is it?” He bought the platform almost five years later in a $44bn deal, later renaming it X.\n\nHowever, movements in the airline’s share price on Tuesday suggested investors were not taking the idea of a takeover seriously, with Ryanair shares closing nearly 1% down.\n\nMusk was born in South Africa and, after a stint in Canada, now lives in the US. Airlines based in the EU must be majority-owned by EU nationals or citizens of Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein under the bloc’s rules.\n\nThe row began when O’Leary spoke on Irish radio on Friday, telling an interviewer that he would take no notice of what the Tesla CEO had to say about installing wifi on Ryanair planes.\n\n“I would pay no attention whatsoever to Elon Musk,” he told Newstalk. “He’s an idiot. Very wealthy, but he’s still an idiot … What Elon Musk knows about flights and drag would be zero.”\n\nHe claimed that adding a Starlink antenna to every jet would push the fuel bill up by “an extra dollar for every passenger we fly and the reality for us is we can’t afford those costs. Passengers won’t pay for internet usage; if it’s free, they’ll use it – but they won’t pay one euro each to use the internet.”\n\nO’Leary, 64, also said he was “thankfully” too old to have any social media accounts.\n\nRyanair was contacted for comment.",

    "description": "Legacy automakers and Tesla rival Rivian have recently announced roadmaps to pursue autonomous driving technology in-house.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has called legacy automakers' hesitancy to license Tesla's Full Self-Driving software \"crazy,\" but a slew of industry moves show that their reluctance is strategic.\n\nIn recent weeks, more automakers have released roadmaps to build key pieces of automated driving software rather than outsourcing the technology. Because automakers see vehicle tech as a brand-defining component, a Tesla license can become a hard sell.\n\nRivian, for example, is going deeper into vertical integration by designing a proprietary chip for the brain behind the company's autonomous driving computer. CEO RJ Scaringe even broached the idea of pursuing a robotaxi business at Rivian's Autonomy & AI Day in early December.\n\nLegacy automakers aren't taking the same ambitious route of designing custom chips, but they have begun to seek in-house solutions.\n\nFord announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that it plans to develop eyes-off driving software for public roads by 2028. The company said going in-house cuts costs by 30% and provides more control over how the software is integrated and deployed.\n\n\"To integrate, I can't do this with all these suppliers,\" Paul Costa, Ford's head of electrical engineering, told Business Insider. \"We need to bring this stuff in-house, and it allows for this ability to do the trifecta at once: smaller, cheaper, and higher performance.\"\n\nMusk said in a X post in November that it was \"crazy\" that legacy automakers didn't want to license Tesla FSD, an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that the EV maker has said will enable fully autonomous driving.\n\n\"When legacy auto does occasionally reach out, they tepidly discuss implementing FSD for a tiny program in 5 years with unworkable requirements for Tesla, so pointless,\" Musk said in the post.\n\nMusk didn't specify what those requirements were. A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nExperts who track the software side of the automotive industry told Business Insider there's a practical reason to go in-house, even if there are near-term challenges.\n\nChris Ahn, a principal at Deloitte who consults for key automakers, told Business Insider that companies have to decide what level of autonomy their customer base will want and how to achieve it, like using lidar or using a cameras-only system.\n\n\"It's not so much like, 'I'm taking it in-house because I don't want to use somebody's technology.' But this is a competitive business for them,\" Ahn said. \"People who own Fords own Fords for certain reasons that are probably different reasons than why people who own Mercedes own Mercedes. And I think each of these automakers are going to have to define what does ADAS mean for the user base of my brand today.\"\n\nSteve Man, a senior auto analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, told Business Insider that the technology stack of autonomous vehicles could be thought of as three interconnected parts: the software, the sensors, and the actuators — the components that control the physical movement of the car.\n\nAll three components need to be able to \"talk\" to each other within a vehicle platform, Man said, which can be challenging and costly to do when an automaker relies on multiple suppliers.\n\n\"It's actually cheaper to bring everything in-house to integrate those three buckets of things,\" Man said.\n\nAs automakers seek more control over their technology, the tools to build autonomy are becoming more accessible. That makes a Tesla FSD license a less compelling business case.\n\nAt CES, Nvidia introduced Alpamayo, a package of AI reasoning models, simulation tools, and datasets automakers can use to develop self-driving technology.\n\nMercedes-Benz was revealed to be Nvidia's first major customer; the automaker plans to launch a Tesla FSD-level ADAS built on Alpamayo by the end of the year.\n\nAlpamayo isn't a full-stack autonomous driving software that automakers simply plug in. An Nvidia spokesperson told Business Insider it's a toolset that can \"strengthen and speed up an OEM's own ADAS or autonomy program, whether they're building end-to-end systems or upgrading existing architectures.\"\n\nAutomakers still need proprietary data and talent to implement and develop their autonomous systems.\n\nHugh Nguyen, a KPMG partner who specializes in autonomous driving systems, told Business Insider that Alpamayo \"democratizes\" AV development by reducing the cost and time for training self-driving systems.\n\nDuring a Q&A session at CES, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called Tesla FSD \"completely world-class,\" before drawing a distinction between Tesla's goals and Nvidia's.\n\n\"We're not a self-driving car company,\" he said. \"We just want to enable the world's autonomous industry. Everything that moves should be autonomous.\"",

    "description": "Vay is rental car service startup that is fully embracing remote-driving technology in order to deliver cars to users without a human inside.",
    "fullText": "In the world of robotaxis, there's a stigma around remote driving. Are you really \"driverless\" if there's a person — even remotely — at the wheel?\n\nOne startup is fully embracing it.\n\nVay is a Berlin-based startup founded by two engineers and a former Zoox employee.\n\nThe company is taking a somewhat contrarian approach to what it calls a \"driverless car.\"\n\nInstead of automating the ride-hailing service, which can be technically challenging and costly to scale, Vay wants to rethink how we rent cars.\n\nTo do so, Vay wants to leverage remote-driving technology and, eventually, autonomy to deliver cars without humans inside to people who need a private vehicle for less than a day.\n\nThomas von der Ohe, cofounder and CEO of Vay, told Business Insider that the goal is to be cheaper than an Uber and more convenient than a traditional brick-and-mortar rental program.\n\n\"It's basically by far the most affordable A to B transport,\" von der Ohe, a former technical program manager during the early days of Zoox, said. \"It's half the price of Uber and half the price of robotaxis. How it works: We just bring the car, you then drive, and then when you're done, you don't have to park.\"\n\nVon der Ohe spent less than two years at Zoox when the company was just 60 people large and had yet to be acquired by Amazon. The Vay cofounder said he oversaw some of the first public testing of Zoox cars when there were safety drivers inside the vehicle.\n\nAt the robotaxi company, von der Ohe said he saw a goal with an ever-shifting timeline.\n\n\"It always felt like it was three years out,\" he said of autonomous driving. \"And then every year it shifted by a year. So we wanted to have self-driving cars everywhere in 2020 at Zoox. And then it was 2021 and so forth.\"\n\nVon der Ohe left Zoox in 2018. Instead of fixating on robotaxis, von der Ohe wanted to stay in mobility but work on something that could be faster to bring to market and easier to scale with less capital. Vay was born.\n\nCustomers order a car the same way they hail an Uber or Lyft through Vay's app. To rent a car, users have to upload a driver's license and a photo of themselves.\n\nVay proposes that users can get a car delivered to them without a driver within minutes, as long as they're within the service area or geofence. If you're out of the service area, then you're out of luck.\n\nOnce the car is delivered, the renter takes over.\n\nThe startup services Las Vegas, where it manages a fleet of 100 Kia Niros, a compact, all-electric SUV. Each Kia is retrofitted with four cameras. There are no other sensors, von der Ohe said.\n\nThe Vay cofounder told Business Insider that the service area is about twice the size of San Francisco.\n\nInside Vay's Vegas office, there are about eight driving stations, in which a trained human operator remotely controls Vay's vehicle fleet. The setup looks like a video game simulation with three computer screens and a disembodied driver's seat.\n\nA large red button to the left of the driver's seat activates an emergency protocol during which the car pulls over to the side of the road.\n\nVincent Reddy, an operations lead for Vay, said that there are several criteria a remote driver needs to meet, including completing about 1,000 kilometers of remote driving. Reddy remotely drove Business Insider during a demo ride.\n\n\"It's similar to kind of like a high-grade racing sim,\" Reddy said of the driving experience. \"The thing that feels the most different is not having the feedback of what it feels like driving over bumps and things on the road because the seat doesn't move. There's no G-force, or you don't get the feeling of accelerating or braking.\"\n\nTo deliver the cars, Vay only uses the remote-driving technology on local roads and stays under 25 mph. The car can go on the highway once the customer takes over the vehicle.\n\nThere were no notable incidents during a 10-minute driverless ride around the block of Vay's Vegas office.\n\nVay's value proposition to customers is that the service is cheaper and more flexible than hailing an Uber.\n\nVon der Ohe told Business Insider that the service should be about 50% cheaper than the average Uber ride.\n\nUsers are charged by the minute, with a decreased price if they are parked, in case they, for example, need to grab groceries or hit the gym.\n\nWhen Business Insider viewed the app, the pricing was at $0.35 per minute while driving and $0.05 per minute while parked. At those prices, a 30-minute drive to and from a destination, including an hour-and-a-half stop, would cost around $25.\n\nWhen asked if the pricing will change based on demand, von der Ohe said the company doesn't yet have a pricing mechanism, such as surge pricing, in place, but expects there will be changes to the structure.\n\nThe CEO said he can keep the costs low because Vay's vehicle fleet doesn't have a complex sensor suite, and the remote operators manage multiple cars.\n\nVon der Ohe said that as of January 2026, there is one remote operator for every 10 vehicles. However, that doesn't mean a remote driver is operating 10 vehicles at the same time. Instead, a remote operator can deliver one car and immediately move on to the next vehicle.\n\n\"So I have much more cars and remote drivers, and that's why we make it half the price,\" he said.\n\nVay employs about 200 people and raised more than $200 million, including a $60 million investment from Grab Holdings, the Singaporean tech company that owns Grab, the super app of Southeast Asia.\n\nWhile von der Ohe told Business Insider that building a fully autonomous ride experience like Waymo is not on Vay's road map, the CEO said his startup will gradually add autonomous driving features.\n\n\"We're not in competition with them,\" von der Ohe said of robotaxi operators.\n\nSince its founding, Vay has provided 35,000 trips, according to the CEO.\n\nHe said the service has especially seen high demand during the Consumer Electronics Show.\n\nWhen Von der Ohe opened the app, the wait time to get a car was 31 minutes.\n\n\"It's extremely busy today already,\" he said. \"It's a long way. It should be five.\"",

    "fullText": "Experts warn use of VPNs makes it hard to limit access to technology that can create nonconsensual explicit images\n\nDays after Malaysia made global headlines by announcing it would temporarily ban Grok over its ability to generate “grossly offensive and nonconsensual manipulated images”, the generative AI tool was conversing breezily with accounts registered in the country.\n\n“Still here! That DNS block in Malaysia is pretty lightweight – easy to bypass with a VPN or DNS tweak,” Grok’s account on X said in response to a question from a user.\n\nGrok’s ability to allow users to create sexually explicit images, including images of children, has created a global outcry over recent weeks, with regulators and politicians around the world launching investigations. Indonesia and Malaysia became the first two countries to announce blocks on the technology, with Malaysia’s regulatory body saying last Sunday it had “directed a temporary restriction” on access to Grok, effective as of 11 January 2026. Officials in the Philippines have said they too plan to ban the technology.\n\nBlocking access to Grok is not straightforward, however. The technology not only exists across multiple platforms, including a standalone app and website, but is also integrated across X, which, along with Grok, is owned by Elon Musk’s xAI.\n\nOver the past week, X users, and even Grok itself, have advised people on how to bypass restrictions. This includes using a VPN – many of which are available for free – or changing domain name system (DNS), the protocol on the internet that turns address names into IP addresses that load websites.\n\nWhen the Guardian tried to use Grok in Indonesia, its website was working even without a VPN, though the Grok app did not work. Grok was also still responding to Indonesian accounts on X, where it functions as an integrated chatbot. X has not been subject to a ban.\n\nEven if governments could completely restrict Grok, though, this is not a real solution, said Nana Nwachukwu, an AI governance expert and PhD researcher at Trinity College Dublin.\n\n“Blocking Grok is like slapping a Band-Aid on a weeping wound that you haven’t cleaned,” she said. “You block Grok, and then you go around shouting you’ve done something. Meanwhile, people can use VPNs to access the same platforms.” Or, they could simply turn to one of the many other platforms that offer the same functions, including “smaller, general purpose AI systems that are largely unknown”, Nwachukwu added.\n\nGovernments should instead focus on law enforcement and investigating individuals who use such tools to break the law, she added. “Platforms are required by law to provide information to law enforcement when a crime has been committed,” Nwachukwu said. “If we see people being arrested, people being tried in courts, people being jailed for these offences, that’s a sign that this is a real crime.”\n\nX should build accountability into its platform – and clean itself up, said Nwachukwu: “All of those offending images should be removed from the platform.”\n\nOn Wednesday, X announced additional safeguards in response to continued public anger, saying it would stop the @Grok account on X from “allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis”, including paid subscribers. However, the Guardian found that it was possible to get around such restrictions by using the standalone version of Grok, easily accessible through a web browser, to create short videos in which clothes are removed from images of real women.\n\nThis could then be posted to X’s public platform, where it could be viewed by users around the world within seconds.\n\nMusk’s company also said that, in jurisdictions where such content is illegal, it will geoblock the ability of all users in those locations to generate images of real people in bikinis, or similar attire, in Grok on X, adding that “xAI is implementing similar geoblocking measures for the Grok app”.\n\nExperts warn users may still be able to get around such “geoblocks” through a VPN. It is also not clear in which countries such restrictions will be implemented.\n\nIn Malaysia, the communications minister, Fahmi Fadzil, has said restrictions on Grok would only be lifted once the ability to produce harmful content had been disabled, according to local media reports.\n\nDr Nuurrianti Jalli, a visiting fellow at the media, technology and society programme at ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said the threat of blocking Grok could be a useful way to apply pressure to companies to respond quickly, adding that it “shifts the debate from ‘individual bad actors’ to questions of platform responsibility, safety by design, and accountability when safeguards fail”. It could also “slow the spread of abuse, reduce casual misuse and create a clear boundary around what authorities consider unacceptable”, she said.\n\nIn Indonesia, Grok has been used to create nonconsensual sexualised images of singers and celebrities, including one of the country’s most popular girl groups, JKT48, while in Malaysia, women report similar abuses, including cases where the tool has been used to remove their hijabs, according to Malaysian media.\n\nSome women resorted to publicly telling Grok on X that they do not authorise it to “crawl, take, process or edit” any of their photos.\n\nJalli said governments should push for greater transparency “about how safety measures are implemented, how abuse reports are handled and what enforcement steps are taken when harmful content is generated or circulated”.\n\nThe Malaysian communications and multimedia commission and the ministry of communications did not respond to a request for comment. Indonesia’s ministry of communication and digital affairs also did not respond.\n\nNwachukwu said safeguards should be built into the AI system, rather than “gates” built around it. “Both the [geographic] restriction from X, [and] the restriction from the government is gated access, and gates can be broken down,” she said.\n\nAdditional reporting from Hidayatullah",

    "fullText": "Technophile Anne Goldberg has become accustomed to formatting PowerPoint presentations in her career as a recruiter.\n\nAs a result, when she found herself between jobs in the fall of 2013, she was happy when a friend paid her a fee to create a slideshow for a relative's 80th birthday party.\n\nThe guests loved the display and congratulated Golberg, then 61, on her digital prowess, which dates back to being an early adopter of computers in the 1980s. She thought nothing more of it.\n\nOver the next 10 days, she was surprised to receive a series of calls from older adults seeking her advice on operating their laptops, iPads, and iPhones.\n\nTheir queries led to a lightbulb moment. \"What if I turn this into a business?\" she thought.\n\nThe next day, harnessing the cold-calling skills she'd deployed in recruitment, she contacted an independent living facility in her home city of Boca Raton, Florida.\n\nShe spoke with the activities coordinator and asked whether the residents might be interested in a beginner's course in operating electronic devices such as smartphones.\n\n\"I got the gig,\" Goldberg told Business Insider. She hosted her first class within a week when seniors turned up with their seldom-used iPhones and Android devices.\n\nMany had been coerced by their families, who had tried unsuccessfully to show them the ropes. Golberg broke the ice by joking, \"I know you hate the idea of being here.\"\n\nBut the session was a resounding success. Twelve years later, she teaches classes at retirement homes in Florida.\n\nShe recently published her book, \"Take This Phone and Shove It!: A Frustrated Senior's Guide to Smartphones.\"\n\n\"It's incredibly rewarding,\" Goldberg, whose average client is 85 years old, said. \"It's great to see the glint in their eyes and the sense of achievement when someone finally 'gets it.'\"\n\nMost of the seniors, she said, are drawn to the fact that she's in her 70s. \"They prefer the advice of someone from their generation — or close enough — who understands the challenges.\"\n\nHere are three tips that Goldberg shares with her clientele.\n\nGoldberg said that many of her clients are scared of looking incompetent in the face of technology.\n\n\"They think they are dumb and feel threatened by having to learn,\" she said.\n\nStill, they soon prove to themselves — and others — that their fears are unfounded.\n\nShe recalled helping an octogenarian save a photo to her iPhone that had been sent by text.\n\nThe boomer talked her through the process, and she was amazed by how easy it was. \"She said, 'Are you kidding me? Is that all I have to do?\"\n\nCuriosity and a positive attitude go a long way. \"Don't say, 'I can't do it,'\" Goldberg said. \"Say, 'I can't do it yet.'\"\n\nIt's tempting to hark back to the \"golden age\" before every Tom, Dick, and Harry owned iPhones.\n\nThey might seem like halcyon days — and Goldberg respects that point of view — but the reality is that modern technology is here to stay.\n\nShe encourages her students to think about the benefits of electronic devices, especially when their families live far away.\n\n\"I say, 'You can talk to them and see them at the same time nowadays,'\" she said. \"'You couldn't do that 50 years ago.'\"\n\nAs soon as they learn how to use FaceTime, they wish they'd known about it sooner.\n\nGoldberg recalls the thrill of receiving a FaceTime tour of her son's new apartment in Colorado. \"I want other seniors to experience the same feeling.\"\n\nGoldberg understands people's misgivings about breaking their expensive devices.\n\nHowever, she said there are only a handful of ways to make that happen.\n\n\"If you throw your phone against the wall in frustration, it will break,\" she tells her clients with a laugh. Crushing it with your car wheels is not a smart idea.\n\nShe used to say that dropping an iPhone into the toilet was curtains, too. More recent Apple models can withstand immersion in water up to 6 meters for 30 minutes.\n\nStudents often tell her they're scared of damaging their screen by tapping it too hard. Goldberg asks if they've ever licked their finger and touched an iron to test the level of heat.\n\n\"Everybody nods their heads except for the rich people who never had to,\" she joked. \"I say, 'You touch the iron fast because you don't want to get burned — and that's exactly how you tap on your phone.'\"",

    "fullText": "2 minute read | Jan 16, 2026 \nmanagement, product\n\nIf you’re worried about being left behind by technology, stop obsessing over tools.\n\nBefore alarm clocks were common, people paid humans to wake them up - called knocker uppers.\n\nIf you were alive during the 1800s Industrial Revolution, you had to start your factory shift before dawn. Being late would mean being fined or losing your livelihood. Alarm clocks were expensive and unreliable. To solve this you would pay knocker uppers to tap on your window to wake you up.\n\nAnd for over 100 years this worked.\n\nBut, technology improved. Alarm clocks became affordable and the human alarm clocks became obsolete. They resisted change by defending their tools - reaching clients without waking neighbours, tapping without breaking glass, waiting to confirm clients were awake.\n\nInstead of resisting change, they should have obsessed over the Job To Be Done:\n“Help me be ready for my shift.”\n\nIf they framed it this way, the future could have looked different. They had the customer relationships and could have sold alarm clocks instead of competing, or expanded into new services such as breakfast delivery - the original DoorDash perhaps.\n\nPeople fear both technology disruption and FOMO. Jensen Huang of NVIDIA frames technology as enabling new ideas:\n\n“If you think about a company and say if we improve productivity, then they need fewer people - well that’s because the company has no more ideas.\n\nBut that’s not true for most companies. If you become more productive and the company becomes more profitable, then usually they hire more people to expand into new areas.\n\nSo long as humans have more ideas, the prosperity of the industry which comes from improved productivity, results in hiring more people, more ideas.”\n\nIf you don’t want to be left behind by technology like the human alarm clock, stop obsessing over tools and start obsessing over problems and ideas on how to solve them.\n\nGet future posts with actionable tips in under 5 minutes and a bonus cheat sheet on '10 Biases Everyone Should Know'.\n\nYour email stays private.

    "fullText": "There is a yearslong lag in the AI hype cycle, according to one former AI researcher turned venture capitalist.\n\nJenny Xiao, who cofounded Leonis Capital in 2021 after a stint at OpenAI, said the current investment excitement around AI is far behind the actual research.\n\n\"There is a massive disconnect between what researchers are seeing and what investors are seeing,\" Xiao said on the Fortune Magazine podcast this week.\n\nWhat's being discussed at the biggest AI conferences is as much as 3 to 5 years behind what researchers are thinking about, Xiao said.\n\n\"We are so behind the technical frontier, and that's the gap I really want to bridge,\" she added.\n\nXiao, who dropped out of a Ph.D. program in economics and AI to take a researcher role at OpenAI, founded Leonis Capital to bridge the worlds of venture capital and deep academic AI research.\n\n\"With AI, there needs to be a new generation of founders. There needs to be a new generation of VCs,\" she said.\n\nIt's also the first time investors need to be able to provide financial support to both the market and the technology, she added. Unlike SaaS companies, which were built on a \"stable tech stack,\" AI is moving fast. To keep up, Xiao said investors are going to need to be as technical as the founders.\n\nIf she has one piece of advice for investors who haven't gone deep into the technical side, it's that they should know \"AI progress isn't linear,\" she said.\n\nThey should know AI progress happens in \"lumps,\" she said. So, questions about why AI progress is slowing down or speeding up aren't the best way to characterize the rate of development.\n\n\"It's neither of those two extremes,\" she said. \"It's somewhere in between.\"\n\nLeonis Capital did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Move comes as calls for Australia-style social media ban for under-16s grow around world\n\nTikTok will begin to roll out new age-verification technology across the EU in the coming weeks, as calls grow for an Australia-style social media ban for under-16s in countries including the UK.\n\nByteDance-owned TikTok, and other major platforms popular with young people such as YouTube, are coming under increasing pressure to better identify and remove accounts belonging to children.\n\nThe system, which has been quietly piloted in the EU over the past year, analyses profile information, posted videos and behavioural signals to predict whether an account may be belong to a user under the age of 13.\n\nAs well as analysing information the account holder provides about themselves, the technology looks at behaviour such as the videos a user publishes, and “other on-platform behaviour”.\n\nTikTok said accounts flagged by the system would be reviewed by specialist moderators rather than face an automatic ban, and may then be removed.\n\nIt also said users would have an opportunity to appeal against the removal of an account if an error had been made.\n\nOptions for age identification offered by TikTok during the appeal process include facial age estimation by the verification company Yoti, credit card authorisation or government-approved identification.\n\nThe European pilot led to the removal of thousands of accounts.\n\nThe rollout of the system comes as European authorities scrutinise how platforms verify users’ ages under data protection rules.\n\nTikTok said its system complied with data and privacy laws. “The prediction of the likelihood that someone is under the age of 13 is not used for purposes other than to decide whether to send an account to human moderators and to monitor and improve the technology,” the company said in a blogpost.\n\n“By adopting this approach, we are able to deliver safety for teens in a privacy-preserving manner. We take our responsibility to protect our community, and teens in particular, incredibly seriously.”\n\nIt said other features to protect younger users on its service included not allowing under-16s to direct-message, while under-18s have a 60-minute screen-time limit and do not receive notifications “after bed time”.\n\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, also uses Yoti to verify users’ ages on Facebook.\n\nIn December, Australia implemented a social media ban for people under the age of 16. On Thursday, the country’s eSafety commissioner revealed that more than 4.7m accounts had been removed across 10 platforms – including YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Snap and Facebook – since the ban was implemented on 10 December.\n\nEarlier this week, Keir Starmer told MPs he was open to a social media ban for young people in the UK after becoming concerned about the amount of time children and teenagers were spending on their smartphones.\n\nThe prime minister told Labour MPs he had become alarmed at reports of five-year-olds spending hours in front of screens each day, as well as increasingly worried about the damage social media was doing to under-16s.\n\nStarmer has previously opposed banning social media for children, believing such a move would be difficult to police and could push teenagers towards the dark web.\n\nEarlier this month, Ellen Roome, whose 14-year-old son Jools Sweeney died after an online challenge went wrong, called for more rights for parents to access social media accounts of their children if they die.\n\nThe European parliament is pushing for age limits on social media, while Denmark wants to ban social media for those under 15.\n\nTikTok told Reuters the new technology was built specifically to comply with the EU’s regulatory requirements. The company has worked with Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, its lead EU privacy regulator, while developing the system.\n\nIn 2023, a Guardian investigation found that moderators were being told to allow under-13s to stay on the platform if they claimed their parents were overseeing their accounts.",

    "description": "The use of generative AI in video games has been controversial to say the least, but when it comes to art, the blowback has been even stronger. One game currently being accused of using the technology is Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, as the new trailer for the fighting game's upcoming second season of DLC characters is being picked apart online. Viewers and commenters have pored over the trailer, claiming that the character designs are inconsistent and that certain visual elements contain generative AI. The biggest smoking gun, according to viewers, is a quick shot of series antagonist Geese Howard, who appears to be missing an entire foot.\nOther instances of generative AI pointed out include Blue Mary's motorcycle missing several vital components--and being a completely different model from what she normally rides--and Kim Jae Hoon having noticeably different wardrobes between his cinematic and gameplay character models.",

    "fullText": "In Mansion House speech, mayor will talk of opportunities technology offers but highlight mass unemployment risk\n\nSadiq Khan is to warn in a major speech that artificial intelligence (AI) could destroy swathes of jobs in London and “usher in a new era of mass unemployment” unless ministers act now.\n\nIn his annual Mansion House speech, the London mayor will say the capital is “at the sharpest edge of change” because of its reliance on white-collar workers in the finance and creative industries, and professional services such as law, accounting, consulting and marketing.\n\nThe mayor will argue that “we have a moral, social and economic duty to act” to ensure that new jobs are created to replace those that will disappear, with entry-level and junior jobs the first to go.\n\nIn the speech on Thursday night, Khan will highlight research that suggests 70% of skills in the average job will have changed by 2030.\n\nHowever, he also sees huge potential benefits from AI for public services and productivity across the economy.\n\nWhen he addresses business leaders and bankers at Mansion House, the London mayor will say: “AI could enable us to transform our public services, turbocharge productivity and tackle some of our most complex challenges,” but used recklessly, will “usher in a new era of mass unemployment”. He will warn that the impact on the labour market will be “nothing short of colossal”.\n\nBut he will say that there is a clear choice: “seize the potential of AI and use it as a superpower for positive transformation and creation or surrender to it and sit back and watch as it becomes a weapon of mass destruction of jobs.”\n\nCity Hall is launching a London taskforce on AI and the future of work, with expertise from the government, businesses and the AI sector, to assess the potential impact of the new technology on London’s jobs market. It will also offer free AI training for Londoners.\n\nMore than half of workers in London expect AI to affect their jobs in some way in the next 12 months, according to City Hall polling.\n\nAcross the UK, up to 3m low-skilled jobs in trades, machine operations and admin roles could disappear by 2035 because of automation and AI, a report by the charity National Foundation for Educational Research found in November.\n\n“We can shape this next technological revolution and, if we are bold in our efforts, ensure AI makes us richer, not poorer, stronger, not weaker, more connected and more confident, and more capable of building a fairer, safer and more prosperous London for everyone,” Khan will say.\n\nHe will argue the UK and others have been too slow to respond to new technology in the past and that the growth of social media has led to a youth mental health crisis, a surge in online abuse and a dangerous rise in misinformation.\n\nSeparately, Susan Langley, major of the City of London, said on Thursday morning she had noticed that some finance workers were wary of coming to London from abroad because they worry about their safety.\n\nHowever, she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The City of London is one of the safest cities in the world. There’s this perception that you’re going to step out of your office and be swept away in a tsunami of crime.\n\n“It’s completely wrong. Competition for investment is really fierce at the moment, and I think any kind of unfounded negative sentiment that’s being pushed out there really risks undermining the UK on the global stage, and we just can’t let it happen.”",

    "fullText": "You might have heard recently that Safari Technology Preview 234 landed the final plan for supporting masonry-style layouts in CSS. It’s called Grid Lanes.\n\nCSS Grid Lanes adds a whole new capability to CSS Grid. It lets you line up content in either columns or rows — and not both.\n\nThis layout pattern allows content of various aspect ratios to pack together. No longer do you need to truncate content artificially to make it fit. Plus, the content that’s earlier in the HTML gets grouped together towards the start of the container. If new items get lazy loaded, they appear at the end without reshuffling what’s already on screen.\n\nIt can be tricky to understand the content flow pattern as you are learning Grid Lanes. The content is not flowing down the first column to the very bottom of the container, and then back up to the top of the second column. (If you want that pattern, use CSS Multicolumn or Flexbox.)\n\nWith Grid Lanes, the content flows perpendicular to the layout shape you created. When you define columns, the content flows back and forth across those columns, just like to how it would if rows existed. If you define rows, the content will flow up and down through the rows — in the column direction, as if columns were there.\n\nHaving a way to see the order of items can make it easier to understand this content flow. Introducing the CSS Grid Lanes Inspector in Safari. It’s just the regular Grid Inspector, now with more features.\n\nSafari’s Grid Inspector already reveals the grid lines for Grid Lanes, and labels track sizes, line numbers, line names, and area names. Now it has a new feature — “Order Numbers”.\n\nYou might be tempted to believe the content order doesn’t matter. With pages like this photo gallery — most users will have no idea how the photos are ordered in the HTML. But for many users, the content order has a big impact on their experience. You should always consider what it’s like to tab through content — watching one item after another sequentially come into focus. Consider what it’s like to listen to the site through a screenreader while navigating by touch or keyboard. With Grid Lanes, you can adjust flow-tolerance to reduce the jumping around and put items where people expect.\n\nTo know which value for flow tolerance to choose, it really helps to quickly see the order of items. That makes it immediately clear how your CSS impacts the result.\n\nOrder Numbers in the Grid Inspector is an extension of a feature Safari’s Flexbox Inspector has had since Safari 16.0 — marking the order of Flex items. Seeing content order is also helpful when using the order property in Flexbox.\n\nOrder Numbers in Safari’s Grid Inspector works for CSS Grid and Subgrid, as well as Grid Lanes.\n\nThe Grid and Flexbox layout inspectors might seem similar across browsers, but the team behind Safari’s Web Inspector has taken the time to finely polish the details. In both the Grid and Flexbox Inspectors, you can simultaneously activate as many overlays as you want. No limits. And no janky scrolling due to performance struggles.\n\nSafari’s Flexbox Inspector visually distinguishes between excess free space and Flex gaps, since knowing which is which can solve confusion. It shows the boundaries of items, revealing how they are distributed both on the main axis and the cross axis of Flexbox containers. And it lists all the Flexbox containers, making it easier to understand what’s happening overall.\n\nOur Grid Inspector has a simple and clear interface, making it easy to understand the options. It also lists all Grid containers. And of course, you can change the default colors of the overlays, to best contrast with your site content.\n\nAnd Safari’s Grid and Flexbox Inspectors are the only browser devtools that label content order. We hope seeing the order of content in Grid Lanes helps you understand it more thoroughly and enjoy using this powerful new layout mechanism.\n\nOrder Numbers in Safari’s Grid Inspector shipped today in Safari Technology Preview 235. Let us know what you think. There’s still time to polish the details to make the most helpful tool possible. You can ping Jen Simmons on Bluesky or Mastodon with links, comments and ideas.",

    "fullText": "There’s no need to buy new – unless your model’s ready for retirement. Our technology expert compares the top Apple smartwatches available right now\n\nThe best running watches – tested\n\nThe best Apple Watch may be the one already on your wrist.\n\nEach generation of Apple’s smartwatch is fairly iterative, with most of the best features added via software updates, which means there’s no need to buy a new device each year. That said, if your watch has seen better days, or it’s stopped receiving updates, then your best options are set out below.\n\nWhile several third-party smartwatches are compatible with the iPhone, they don’t offer the same level of integration that the Apple Watch does with the phone, iOS and the company’s other devices and services. It’s the best smartwatch for iPhone users, but note that you’ll need an iPhone running iOS 26 – iPhone 11 or later – to use one. The Apple Watch can’t be used with Android or as a standalone device.\n\nBest Apple Watch for most people:\nSE 3\n\nBest mid-range Apple Watch: \n\n Series 11\n\nBest Apple Watch for battery: \n\n Ultra 3\n\nI have been reviewing consumer electronics for 18 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert. In that time, I’ve seen all manner of tech fads come and go, smartphone giants rise and fall, the cutting-edge morph into the mainstream, and have poked, prodded and evaluated more than 1,000 devices – sometimes to destruction.\n\nWe conduct real-world testing of smartwatches and their various features to ensure they meet expectations and compare to their rivals.\n\nWe change the straps, poke, prod and twiddle every button, dial and setting. We wear the smartwatches day and night, seeing how they feel on the wrist, how well they fit under and with clothes, whether they catch on objects in daily life, and how well they stay put during vigorous exercise.\n\nWe test their health metrics, track various activities, and compare them for accuracy. We do everything a typical smartwatch user would, picking up notifications, installing apps, sending messages, making calls, exercising, listening to music, monitoring our health and tracking our sleep. We see how long the battery lasts in general use and while exercising, whether it’s consistent and reliable, plus how long it takes to charge.\n\nThe recently updated entry-level Apple Watch SE 3 offers almost everything its more expensive siblings do, but at a discount.\n\nIt’s light and comfortable to wear, and arrives in a choice of 40mm and 44mm case sizes. Available in either starlight or midnight aluminium, with many different strap colours and types, it should fit most wrists and styles.\n\nThe big upgrade for the SE this year is the always-on display, as well as the rapid S10 chip and 64GB of storage from the Series 11. It runs the latest watchOS 26, which comes with super-handy double-tap and wrist-flick gestures to clear notifications, alarms and scroll through your widgets hands-free. Siri runs locally, so you can quickly set timers, dictate messages and other basic features without an internet connection. And the SE 3 has all the deep integration with the iPhone that makes Apple Watches great, including Apple Pay, notifications, calls, texts, maps, photos, music control and many other features. Battery life is about one and a half days.\n\nThe SE 3 sports an older design than the current Series watch line, with chunkier bezels, a slightly smaller and dimmer screen and a 1mm thicker body, but otherwise it looks very similar to all other Apple Watches. Only those comparing them side by side are likely to spot the difference.\n\nWhile you get most of Apple’s class-leading health-tracking features, this entry-level model can’t take ECGs of your heart, record blood oxygen saturation or notify you about any potential hypertension. It still has an optical heart-rate monitor for recording throughout the day and night, though. Its skin temperature sensor allows for retrospective ovulation estimates in the cycles tracking app, too, alongside other features.\n\nIt tracks all your usual sleep, standing, steps and movement goals, and the GPS makes it a decent running and workout tracker. It supports Apple’s new AI Workout Buddy coach, but this requires an iPhone 15 Pro or later with Apple Intelligence to be carried with you on runs.\n\nNote that 5G models are available, but require a plan linked to your phone provider. And if you’re looking for a cellular-connected watch, I’d recommend the Series 11 with 5G instead.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nThe SE 3 offers all the essential bits of the Apple Watch experience, including an always-on screen, but in an older-looking body with a few more advanced health features removed. That leaves a great smartwatch for iPhone users that does most of what people want at a good price.\n\nDon’t buy if: you want ECG or hypertension alerts.\n\nRead our full Apple Watch SE 3 review: the bargain smartwatch for iPhone\n\nSize: 40/44mm\nThickness: 10.7mm\nScreen brightness: up to 1,000nits\nTested battery life: 1.5 days\nProcessor: S10\nStorage: 64GB\nWater resistance: 50 metres \nSensors: HR (2nd gen), skin temperature, GPS\n\nThe biggest, boldest and longest-lasting Apple Watch is the Ultra 3, which builds on the Series 11 with a supersized screen and body, and adds a bunch of adventure-ready features – ready for life in the wilderness, or just work in the city.\n\nIt’s available only in titanium and at 49mm, although there’s a choice of a natural or black finish. It has the biggest and brightest screen on an Apple Watch, protected by scratch-resistant sapphire crystal. Similar to the Series 11, the display is much brighter off-angle, making it easier to read at a glance.\n\nOn the inside, it’s similar to the Series 11: an S10 chip, 64GB storage, and 5G support as standard with a compatible phone plan. It runs the same watchOS 26, including the double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, but battery life is three days plus with general use. This will see you through a long weekend, or up to 14 hours of tracking workouts at the highest accuracy settings.\n\nOn the outside, the Ultra 3 has an extra action button, with which you can start a workout and light up the screen as a torch, plus other features. There’s a chunkier crown and a loudspeaker that doubles as a siren to attract attention in emergency situations. New for this year is satellite connectivity for free SOS messaging to the emergency services, if things go awry when you’re out of cellular signal range.\n\nThe Ultra 3 also has dual-band GPS, making it one of the most accurate running, cycling and sports tracking watches available. It offers a good suite of tracking metrics, plus Workout Buddy for motivation, if you carry your iPhone with you. The watch can also track dives to 40 metres’ depth and at least 22 other activities.\n\nSize-wise, it’s big for an Apple Watch – but the Ultra 3 still fits under shirt cuffs, and is relatively compact compared with adventure watch rivals from the likes of Garmin. This is a good choice should you want an Apple Watch that stands out – although it costs about twice as much as the Series 11.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nThe Ultra 3 is the biggest, boldest, longest-lasting, and most capable Apple Watch. It’s ready for daily life, workouts or the odd adventure into the wilderness.\n\nDon’t buy if: you need a compact model or have smaller wrists.\n\nRead our full Apple Watch Ultra 3 review: the biggest and best smartwatch for an iPhone\n\nSize: 49mm\nThickness: 12mm \nScreen brightness: up to 3,000nits\nTested battery life: 3 days\nProcessor: S10\nStorage: 64GB\nWater resistance: 100 metres \nSensors: HR (3rd gen), ECG, spO2, skin/water temp, depth, dual-band GPS\n\nSeries 10 \n\n The same design as the Series 11 with the same chip and screen, but with a slightly smaller battery, less scratch-resistant glass and 4G rather than 5G. Worth buying at a discount.\n\nSeries 9 \n\n Thicker and with a slightly smaller screen than the Series 10 or 11, but worth buying refurbished if you don’t want the SE 3.\n\nUltra 2 \n\n 2023’s Ultra Apple Watch was great, and is only missing a few small upgrades to screen, battery, 5G and satellite SOS compared with the current model.\n\nWearable devices can take a beating, so if your existing Apple Watch is looking a bit tired, there are things you can do. Simply cleaning out the speaker grilles and other crevices can help, as can swapping out the straps or switching up the face to make the watch look fresh.\n\nGreater damage, such as a cracked screen, can be repaired, although options are more limited than those for an iPhone. Apple charges at least £169 for such repairs; third parties can be cheaper. Having Apple replace batteries costs £95.\n\nBuying refurbished watches is a good option for the planet and your wallet. Apple’s are among the fastest and smoothest-running smartwatches available, and they are supported by software updates for about six years from release, so buying a refurbished model can save you some money.\n\nThere are two types of refurbished Apple Watch available: those that Apple refurbishes and sells as new directly, and those refurbished by third parties that are available in various grades or conditions for less.\n\nSeveral third-party retailers offer secondhand or refurbished Apple Watches, including the UK high-street chain CeX, online stores such as musicMagpie, and marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay and Back Market.\n\nMake sure you consider the condition of the watch before parting with any cash. Grading is as follows:\n\nGrade A or excellent – virtually identical to new, often with the original box and accessories, making them the most expensive.\n\nGrade B or good – in full working order but with light marks, and it may come with replacement accessories.\n\nGrade C or fair – in full working order but with obvious signs of use, and it may not come with accessories.\n\nOnce you’re satisfied with a watch’s condition, ensure you check that the strap connects properly and that the device powers up and connects to your iPhone. Then check the following:\n\nBattery health – the battery in the Apple Watch is designed to maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for 1,000 full charge cycles. Check the battery health under battery via the Settings app on the watch. Has the battery been replaced?\n\nCharging cable – the Apple Watch requires a special magnetic puck, which costs £29 on its own, to charge. Make sure an authentic, USB-C puck is included and snaps into place correctly on the back of the watch.\n\nButtons – check the buttons and digital crown are in good working order and don’t need to be pressed too hard to function.\n\nSensors – the back of the Apple Watch contains a cluster of delicate sensors. Ensure they work correctly – can you see the LEDs of the heart-rate sensor light up?\n\nSpeakers – check the speakers are free of dirt and fluff, and function correctly for Siri, alarms and calls.\n\nWifi – the Apple Watch shares wifi details with the iPhone, so fully turn off Bluetooth on your iPhone in the Settings app when in range of your home wifi to check the watch can connect properly.\n\nWater resistance – the watch needs to be properly sealed to maintain its water resistance. Has it been obviously opened, and does the refurbisher maintain the original 50-metre water resistance?\n\nWarranty – what kind of warranty and support does the refurbisher offer?\n\nAny Apple Watch Series 7 or older, as you simply won’t benefit from the software support for long before you’ll have to replace the device.\n\nFor more:\n\n The best running watches – tested\n\n The best fitness tech and gadgets, according to experts\n\nSamuel Gibbs is the Guardian’s consumer technology editor",

    "description": "\"We are at a point in history where something amazing is happening, and it may be amazingly good, and it may be amazingly bad.\"",
    "fullText": "Pioneering computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton, whose work has earned him a Nobel Prize and the moniker “godfather of AI,” said artificial intelligence will spark a surge in unemployment and profits.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with the Financial Times last year, the former Google scientist cleared the air about why he left the tech giant, raised alarms on potential threats from AI, and revealed how he uses the technology. But he also predicted who the winners and losers will be.\n\n“What’s actually going to happen is rich people are going to use AI to replace workers,” Hinton said in September. “It’s going to create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits. It will make a few people much richer and most people poorer. That’s not AI’s fault, that is the capitalist system.”\n\nThat echoed comments he gave to Fortune in August 2025, when he said AI companies are more concerned with short-term profits than the long-term consequences of the technology.\n\nLayoffs haven’t spiked, but evidence is mounting that AI is shrinking opportunities, especially at the entry level where recent college graduates start their careers.\n\nA survey from the New York Fed at the time found that companies using AI were much more likely to retrain their employees than fire them, though layoffs are expected to rise in the coming months.\n\nHinton said earlier healthcare is the one industry that will be safe from the potential jobs armageddon.\n\n“If you could make doctors five times as efficient, we could all have five times as much health care for the same price,” he explained on the Diary of a CEO YouTube series in June 2025. “There’s almost no limit to how much health care people can absorb—[patients] always want more health care if there’s no cost to it.”\n\nStill, Hinton believes jobs that perform mundane tasks will be taken over by AI, while sparing some jobs that require a high level of skill.\n\nIn his interview with the FT, he also dismissed OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s idea to pay a universal basic income as AI disrupts the economy and reduces demand for workers, saying it “won’t deal with human dignity” and the value people derive from having jobs.\n\nHinton has long warned about the dangers of AI without guardrails, estimating a 10% to 20% chance of the technology wiping out humans after the development of superintelligence.\n\nIn his view, the dangers of AI fall into two categories: the risk the technology itself poses to the future of humanity, and the consequences of AI being manipulated by people with bad intent.",

In response to Gemini 3, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman late last year reportedly issued a \"code red\" to push teams to accelerate development.\n\n\"Apple's decision to use Google's Gemini models for Siri shifts OpenAI into a more supporting role, with ChatGPT remaining positioned for complex, opt-in queries rather than the default intelligence layer,\" said Parth Talsania, CEO of Equisights Research.\n\nGoogle has been firing on all cylinders to counter OpenAI's early lead in the industry by doubling down on frontier models, and ⁠image and video generation.\n\nApple has faced a series of setbacks on the ​AI front after being late to the race, with Siri's upgrade getting ​delayed, top-level executive changes and the initial rollout of its generative AI tools being met with lukewarm reception.\n\nThe latest agreement builds on a years-long partnership that makes Google the default search engine on ‍Apple devices - a lucrative arrangement that ⁠drives traffic for Google while generating tens of billions in annual revenue for Apple.",

    "fullText": "Zurich-based firm taps into latest robot tech to ‘fibre-spray’ high-end sports shoes worn by the likes of Roger Federer\n\nA robot leg whirs around in a complex ballet as an almost invisible spray of “flying fibre” builds a hi-tech £300 sports shoe at its foot.\n\nThis nearly entirely automated process – like a sci-fi future brought to life – is part of the gameplan from On, the Swiss sports brand that is taking on the sector’s mighty champions Nike and Adidas with a mix of technology and chutzpah.\n\nThe brand is expanding rapidly after teaming up with the former tennis pro Roger Federer to create shoes suitable for the Swiss star’s sport and a mix of fashion-led collaborations including with the luxury brand LOEWE, actor Zendaya and singers FKA twigs and Burna Boy. In China, sales have doubled year-on-year. Growth has been strong in the US and mainland Europe and this month On will open its fourth London store, in Kensington.\n\n“We’re an innovation brand at heart,” says its co-founder, David Allemann, “because we are really going for the long run.”\n\nHe’s speaking from On’s Zurich head office, which has the vibe of a tech firm or luxe gym with light-filled spaces and quirky design features from the spiral staircase and workout room to a hanging fossilised tree.\n\nAllemann says the company’s inspirations are disruptors such as Apple and Dyson. These two brands were on the “mood board” when On was set up as they combine “unique design” with “innovation in terms of user-experience or technology”.\n\nAllemann, a former McKinsey consultant, ditched his job in 2010 as marketing boss of the furniture brand Vitra to start On with a former McKinsey colleague, Caspar Coppetti, and the Swiss Ironman world champion and triathlete Olivier Bernhard.\n\nBernhard’s idea was for a shoe that would protect his body from the impact of long-distance running but also promote speed. The original prototype, developed by Bernhard, an inventive individual as well as a committed sportsman, started out with sections of hose-pipe glued to the bottom of an old pair of trainers.\n\nThe three friends, all keen runners, tried out early versions together and put about £600,000 of their life savings into launching the company. They ordered 1,200 pairs of shoes, which they sold at running meets before convincing some specialist retailers to place orders.\n\nIn 2021, the trio floated the brand on the New York Stock Exchange at a value of $8bn (£5.95bn) , raising almost $750m for the business and netting them about $120m in cash while keeping a large stake in the business. This year they expect to sell 30m pairs. The brand is now worth $16bn.\n\nAfter their innovative design took off, On developed the LightSpray flying fibre technology after a team member met a young student, Johannes Voelchert, at a design fair in 2019. The company decided to fund him for a year to develop his vision, which was inspired by a glue gun used to make Halloween spider-web decorations.\n\n“We said: hey, he’s crazy, but we like that because Olivier was crazy as well,” says Allemann.\n\nVoelchert is now part of a team of hundreds of research and technology experts, from more than 90 countries and numerous industry backgrounds, helping to develop new ideas for On in Zurich with a particular eye on the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.\n\n“We call that the explorer spirit,” says Allemann.\n\nThe idea is to foster innovation and creativity so that, even as a bigger company employing 4,000 people around the world, the whole business, from designers to manufacturers, can take risks on ideas without necessarily knowing the final outcome. “We’re still able to set sail without exactly knowing where we’re arriving without calling home the next day,” Allemann says.\n\nAllemann adds that On is now seeing the benefit of “many little sprouts that now are growing up”, from its move into different sports – such as outdoor training and tennis – to its development of apparel and the opening of retail stores.\n\nThe small brand may control just 1% of the $450bn global sportswear market, according to GlobalData, but it is expanding rapidly.\n\nOn plays in the premium market with its shoes starting from about £120, excluding seasonal promotions, up to £495. That compares with Nike, which runs from £60 to £290, and Adidas, from £40 to £450.\n\nDespite high-end purchases coming under pressure from cost of living increases, sales for the brand are on track to increase by just over a third to hit nearly 3bn Swiss Francs (£2.8bn) this year. On says it has grabbed as much as a fifth of the running shoe market in the UK and other European countries.\n\nIt faces some heavyweight competition. On is just one-tenth the size of Nike, which holds about 14% of the global sportswear market, according to industry analysts GlobalData, with Adidas on 9%. However, both have faced difficulties in recent years, creating space for new challenges including On, Hoka and revitalised old brands such as New Balance or Onitsuka Tiger, now owned by ASICS.\n\nThe company also faced a class action lawsuit last year in the US, where customers claimed its shoes make a “noisy and embarrassing squeak”. Its “CloudTec” trainers, designed with holes to feel like “running on clouds” – were criticised on social media over the noise. On said it did not comment on ongoing legal matters.\n\nOn’s Cloudboom Strike LS laceless shoe, which is made by just nine robots in Zurich and costs £310, has already won the attention of running enthusiasts after the Kenyan runner Hellen Obiri won this year’s New York and last year’s Boston marathon. She also took a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics in a pair.\n\nIn Zurich, the robots in their lab-like room are still outnumbered by humans, who monitor their work and complete the final process. Most of the brand’s footwear is made in traditional factories in Asia. But this year On is aiming to open its first robot-led factory to create a more accessible version of the shoe, the upper half of which is made from a single nearly one mile-long filament of thermoplastic polyurethane in just three minutes. Traditionally, a shoe takes several humans hours of work.\n\nThe factory’s location has not yet been decided, but will be close to one of its main retail markets, with the long-term aim of producing on every continent. That would be a dramatic change from today’s industry, which is largely based in Asia, particularly Vietnam and China.\n\nAllemann says local manufacturing is attractive as it has “a huge advantage from a sustainability point of view, because you don’t have to ship shoes around the world, but also from an agility to market point of view – you can produce much faster, according to what people want”.\n\nHe says LightSpray shoes have a 75% lower CO2 footprint than an ordinary sports shoe, which plays to On’s aim to create more sustainable and recyclable kit.\n\nRetail expansion is also a big part of the story. The latest London opening will make the UK capital its biggest retail centre, with plans for as many as seven in future. It is now part of a global portfolio of 60 outlets, with plans for up to 25 more a year despite the rise of online selling.\n\n“We feel there’s still a lot of potential in retail, if done right. City centres are still a very important place for society, and shopping and sports are an important ingredient to that.”\n\nWith those in their late teens, 20s and 30s keen on sport, particularly training and running, Allemann says the shops “are not just stores but also community hubs where running clubs start”.\n\nHe believes On will continue to expand because participating in sport brings people together in a way the online world cannot.\n\n“Running and sports, that’s such an important part of your life that we see consumers are willing to invest in great performance, innovation and better feel, but also in great design and what that tells us about them.”",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Jan 10 (Reuters) - China can narrow its technological gap with the U.S. driven by growing risk-taking and innovation, though the lack of advanced chipmaking tools is hobbling the ​sector, the country's leading artificial intelligence researchers said on Saturday.\n\nChina's so-called 'AI tiger' startups MiniMax and Zhipu ‌AI had strong debuts on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange this week, reflecting growing confidence in the sector as Beijing fast-tracks AI and ‌chip listings to bolster domestic alternatives to advanced U.S. technology.\n\nYao Shunyu, a former senior researcher at ChatGPT maker OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) who was named technology giant Tencent's chief AI scientist in December, said there was a high likelihood of a Chinese firm becoming the world's leading AI company in the next three to five years but said the lack of ⁠advanced chipmaking machines was the main ‌technical hurdle.\n\n\"Currently, we have a significant advantage in electricity and infrastructure. The main bottlenecks are production capacity, including lithography machines, and the software ecosystem,\" Yao said at an AI ‍conference in Beijing.\n\nChina has completed a working prototype of an extreme-ultraviolet lithography machine potentially capable of producing cutting-edge semiconductor chips that rival the West's, Reuters reported last month. However, the machine has not yet produced working chips and may not do ​so until 2030, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\nYao and other Chinese industry ‌leaders at the Beijing conference on Saturday also acknowledged that the U.S. maintains an advantage in computing power due to its hefty investments in infrastructure.\n\n\"The U.S. computer infrastructure is likely one to two orders of magnitude larger than ours. But I see that whether it's OpenAI or other platforms, they're investing heavily in next-generation research,\" said Lin Junyang, technical lead for Alibaba's flagship Qwen large language model.\n\n\"We, on the other hand, are relatively strapped for ⁠cash; delivery alone likely consumes the majority of our computer infrastructure,\" ​Lin said during a panel discussion at the AGI-Next Frontier Summit ​held by the Beijing Key Laboratory of Foundational Models at Tsinghua University.\n\nLin said China's limited resources have spurred its researchers to be innovative, particularly through algorithm-hardware co-design, which enables AI ‍firms to run large models ⁠on smaller, inexpensive hardware.",
