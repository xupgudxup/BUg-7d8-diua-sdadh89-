    "fullText": "Jensen Huang also announces at CES new, more powerful Vera Rubin chips that will arrive later this year\n\nThe billionaire boss of the chipmaker Nvidia, Jensen Huang, has unveiled new AI technology that he says will help self-driving cars think like humans to navigate more complex situations.\n\nThe world’s most valuable company is to roll out the new technology, Alpamayo, which is designed to help self-driving cars handle tricky situations such as sudden roadworks or unusual driver behaviour on the road, rather than just reacting to previous patterns.\n\nNvidia claims Alpamayo will bring chain-of-thought reasoning to self-driving vehicles, combining what the car sees with language-like reasoning.\n\nIn a speech at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the Nvidia founder and chief executive said: “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here, when machines begin to understand, reason and act in the real world. Robotaxis are among the first to benefit.\n\n“Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments and explain their driving decision. It’s the foundation for safe, scalable autonomy.”\n\nNvidia has started producing a driverless car powered by its technology, the Mercedes-Benz CLA, in partnership with the German carmaker. It will be launched in the US in the coming months, followed by Europe and Asia. Huang showed a video of the car driving through San Francisco with a passenger sitting behind the steering wheel, their hands in their lap.\n\n“It drives so naturally because it learned directly from human demonstrators,” Huang said, “but in every single scenario … it tells you what it’s going to do, and it reasons about what it’s about to do.”\n\nHuang also said the company’s next generation of chips was in full production, and they could deliver five times the computing power of the company’s previous products when serving up chatbots and other AI apps.\n\nHe revealed new details about the chips, which will arrive later this year as Nvidia faces increasing competition from rivals as well as its own customers.\n\nThe Vera Rubin platform, made up of six separate Nvidia chips, is expected to debut later this year. The flagship server will contain 72 of the company’s graphics units and 36 of its new central processors.\n\nHuang showed how they could be strung together into “pods” with more than 1,000 Rubin chips and said they could improve the efficiency of generating what are known as “tokens” – the fundamental unit of AI systems – by 10 times.\n\nTo get the new performance results, Huang said the Rubin chips used a proprietary kind of data that the company hopes the wider industry will adopt.\n\nWhile Nvidia still dominates the market for training AI models, it faces far more competition – from traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices as well as customers such as Alphabet’s Google – in delivering the fruits of those products to hundreds of millions of users of chatbots and other technologies.",

    "description": "Here are the highlights from the world's largest technology trade show happening in Las Vegas, including a new Nvidia chip architecture.",
    "fullText": "The tech scene is starting the year off strong.\n\nOn January 6, the Consumer Electronics Show, the largest and most influential technology trade show, is set to kick off in Las Vegas.\n\nA CES keynote presentation of a new chip from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang already got the show started.\n\nBased on early announcements, the audience can expect novelties this year like the Sweekar AI pet that physically grows, robots that can bend backwards, and a wallpaper TV that is only 0.35 inches thick. Business Insider's Lloyd Lee is also on the scene to report on the latest autonomous vehicle technologies.\n\nFollow this post over the rest of the week to keep up with the most groundbreaking tech at the 2026 CES.\n\nOn Monday, ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show, Huang officially introduced the Vera Rubin architecture, which is now in production and expected to ramp up in volume in the second half of the year. This move follows a blockbuster year for its Blackwell chip, as demand for AI infrastructure continued to surge.\n\nIn a press briefing ahead of Huang's keynote, Dion Harris, Nvidia's senior director of HPC and AI infrastructure solutions, described Vera Rubin as \"six chips that make one AI supercomputer.\"\n\n\"Vera Rubin is designed to address this fundamental challenge that we have: The amount of computation necessary for AI is skyrocketing,\" Huang told the audience during a presentation at the CES.\n\nHuang added that compared to the Blackwell model, Rubin marks a leap in performance, with more than triple the speed, could run inference five times faster, and can deliver significantly more inference compute per watt of energy.\n\nRubin was first announced in 2024 and has been slated to replace Blackwell ever since. The early debut comes months ahead of the late-2026 timeline Nvidia had previously projected.\n\nNamed after astronomer Vera Rubin, who discovered the existence of dark matter, Nvidia said in a press release that the architecture is designed to support more complex, agent-style AI workloads, as well as more networking and data movement.\n\nThe Rubin systems are already lined up for deployment across much of the cloud industry. Nvidia said partners, including Amazon Web Services, OpenAI, Anthropic, alongside the upcoming Doudna system at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, all plan to use the new platform.\n\nThe accelerated launch comes shortly after Nvidia reported record data center revenue, up 66% from a year earlier, driven largely by demand for Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra GPUs. Those chips have become a benchmark for the current AI boom are widely seen as a test of whether spending on AI infrastructure is sustainable.\n\nHuang has previously estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion could be spent globally on AI infrastructure over the next five years. Nvidia said products and services built on the Rubin platform will begin rolling out from partners in the second half of 2026.\n\nNvidia's Huang also used his presentation to unveil Alpamayo, a new open AI model and toolset designed to bring reasoning to autonomous vehicles.\n\nHuang said that Mercedes-Benz cars powered by the system are already expected to hit the road in the first quarter of 2026.\n\n\"Our vision is that someday, every single car, every single truck, will be autonomous,\" said Huang.\n\nAlpamayo is Nvidia's first full-stack push into self-driving technology, with the goal of using vision-language-action models to handle rare and unfamiliar driving scenarios.\n\nMercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius said during the presentation that he recently tested the Nvidia-powered system on public roads and drove for more than an hour through heavy traffic.\n\n\"It feels that the car is on rails. You're just driving, and it does everything,\" Källenius said. \"If you're moving an object that weighs 4,000 pounds at 50 miles an hour, sorry is not going to cut it.\"\n\nBoston Dynamics is teaming up with Google DeepMind to integrate the Gemini AI into its humanoid robot, Atlas, and its robot dog called Spot. Unveiled with Boston Dynamics's parent company, Hyundai Motor Group, at CES on Monday, the partnership aims to let Atlas understand natural-language commands, adapt on the fly, and interact more naturally with people, with the goal of pushing the machine from lab demos into real-world work.\n\nExecutives of Boston Dynamics said in a press release that by embedding a foundation model, Atlas could move beyond preprogrammed actions to navigating unfamiliar environments and identifying and manipulating objects, all of which are core skills for manual labor.\n\n\"Atlas is going to revolutionize the way industry works,\" said CEO Robert Playter in the press release, \"And it marks the first step toward a long-term goal we have dreamed about since we were children—useful robots that can walk into our homes and help make our lives safer, more productive, and more fulfilling.\"",

    "description": "To prevent students from relying on artificial intelligence to write and do homework for them, many professors are returning to pre-technology assessments and having students finish essays in class.",
    "fullText": "Higher Education\n\n AI Nudges Syracuse Professors Back Toward Blue Books, In-Class Work\n\n To prevent students from relying on artificial intelligence to write and do homework for them, many professors are returning to pre-technology assessments and having students finish essays in class.\n\n December 23, 2025 • \n Emalyn Muzzy, syracuse.com\n\n Facebook\n\n LinkedIn\n\n Twitter\n\nPrint\n\n Email\n\n (TNS) — Oksana Korol remembers her parents telling her how they took oral exams in college. Professors would give them a problem to solve. They had 10 minutes to think it through, then explain their answer and reasoning.\n\n“That is completely AI-proof,” said Korol, a biology professor at Onondaga Community College.\n\nKorol, like countless other professors in Central New York, has had to change the way she teaches her class and assesses students’ learning due to the ballooning use of generative artificial intelligence. Many, like her, are relying on those old-school techniques to AI-proof their tests and papers.\n\nAs AI continues to push itself into our everyday lives, it has created a culture of do or die for higher education. Professors have to either adapt their classes or risk students using AI to avoid thinking through tough assignments. Universities can offer courses teaching students to think critically about AI or assume young minds already know how to ask tough questions.\n\nIf higher education as a whole does not adapt, it could be left behind as students embrace AI in their studies.\n\nAt the three largest educational institutions in Syracuse — Syracuse University, Le Moyne College and Onondaga Community College — many professors are returning to pre-technology assessments while students use AI to study in futuristic ways.\n\nOCC and SU student handbooks outline how using AI to complete entire assignments and papers is considered plagiarism or academic misconduct. Le Moyne College does not have a college-wide AI policy, although Provost Jim Hannan said the institution is starting the process to create guidance.\n\nWithout uniform guidance from school leadership, it’s often up to professors to figure out how to handle AI. Some professors spend free time teaching themselves how to wield AI in a productive manner. Others side-eye the technology.\n\nAll of them, however, must understand how it impacts their students’ learning.\n\n“We have to learn how to use (AI) first. That arms race is exhausting and overwhelming when our workloads, admittedly, are already pretty heavy,” said OCC professor Michelle Malinovsky.\n\nIN-CLASS ASSESSMENTS MAKE A RETURN\nWhen a student uses an AI prompt generator to write a research paper, there are signs the student didn’t do it themselves. Malinovsky said older AI versions used the same rhetoric model. Le Moyne English professor Ann Ryan said a student’s paper may be too clean.\n\nThere is no true way to prove a student used AI, unless the student accidentally leaves their prompt in the paper or admits to it, said Rubin.\n\nWhile there are AI detection software, most don’t work, Rubin and Malinovsky said. For that reason, SU and OCC do not recommend using the programs.\n\n“It’s incredibly inaccurate. It’s always reactionary and it causes a huge issue in terms of equity and bias,” Malinovsky said.\n\nSU, Le Moyne and OCC either encourage or require professors to decide how they want students to use AI. They each have three similar pre-made policies professors can put into their syllabuses.\n\nThe policies state that AI cannot be used under any circumstance, students can use limited AI or AI can be used freely within reason.\n\n“It’s a first step of allowing faculty to think about the use and letting students know how an individual faculty member plans to allow or not allow on assessment in the classroom,” said SU Chief Digital Officer Jeff Rubin.\n\nWith the traditional research paper becoming harder to assign, many professors are flipping the classroom. For example, Ryan has students writing in class and brainstorming with classmates.\n\n“I’m workshopping papers in class as students are writing them. Traditionally in a literature class you’d say, ‘You got a 12-page paper due in three weeks,’” Ryan said. “So what we’re doing is we’re writing papers in class.”\n\nMalinovsky, who teaches English and is also a librarian, said she has implemented similar practices. She encourages students to send pictures of handwritten assignments.\n\n“(AI) challenges professors to rethink the assessment. Perhaps if they’re worried about AI use, then bring some of that assessment back into the classroom,” Rubin said.\n\nProfessors have also started to make work more reflective. For Ryan’s class, students had to add a one-to-two page coda on how what they learned in class impacted them to their final paper. They then shared that reflection with the class.\n\nLearning assessments appear to be returning to traditional, in-person techniques. Korol said she has done away with online exams and implemented more in-class tests.\n\n“I think that we’re back to the blue books and we’re maybe going back to the oral exams,” Korol at OCC said.\n\nEven with the potential for misuse, AI can be a powerful tool if harnessed correctly. While assessments embrace older techniques, study strategies are flying forward.\n\nMultiple professors said they see students upload class slides or paste class notes into a chatbot and ask it to create study tools like a practice quiz or study questions. Anthropic , the creator of AI bot Claude,analyzed student chatsand found they also use it to troubleshoot coding problems or synthesize complex information.\n\nKorol has gone one step farther and created a prototype AI tutor, where she uploads questions for students to answer. The AI tutor knows not just the correct answer but the important ideas behind it, meaning students can express the answers in different ways.\n\n“The tutor has been specifically told not to give out the answer, and instead it’s been told to keep asking leading questions. And if you read through this conversation, you will see that the hints are getting more and more transparent as we go along,” Korol said.\n\nKorol has not yet used the tutor with students but is trying to figure out how to deploy the app for campus-wide use.\n\nTEACHING ABOUT AI\nSU is taking AI education one step further: it has begun offering classes and a minor about the impact of AI. Beginning in fall 2026, the Maxwell School of Public Affairs will offer the AI Policy minor. Classes include programming and public policy analysis.\n\nThe idea is not to teach students how to create or use AI, but rather to think critically about its real world applications, said program director Johannes Himmelreich.\n\n“AI is going to have significant social impact. This will create policy challenges that require an understanding of the technology as well as the policy analysis skills,” Himmelreich said.\n\nMalinovsky described generative AI as the “wild west.” There are no specific federal regulations on AI, with regulators instead relying on a patchwork of laws. On Dec. 11, President Donald Trump put out an executive order blocking states from creating their own regulations.\n\nHimmelreich wants students to be able to tackle topics such as how to grow AI without destroying the environment, how AI could impact warfare or if AI could be conscious enough to deserve rights.\n\nThe idea of a minor exploring AI has been under discussion since 2020, a couple years before the public explosion of generative AI.\n\n“ChatGPT wasn’t a technological surprise at all. I mean, I’ve been in demos that OpenAI gave for the older models that weren’t a chat interface. And the difference is that OpenAI changed its policy around how accessible they want the technology to be,” Himmelreich said.\n\nThinking critically about AI is a core part of Milton Santiago’s Generative AI Filmmaking class. He launched the three-credit course this past fall, teaching students how to use generative AI in filmmaking while also discussing its impact.\n\n“We can intercept a lot of the ethical and moral questions that surround these tools currently, which actually I think is probably the biggest benefit of the class,” Santiago said. “Students do have to wrestle with questions of where does creativity begin and end? What does authorship actually look like? Is the environmental impact as this technology stands today worth using the tools?”\n\nTeaching about AI is not only happening in classes or studies surrounding the topic. Malinovsky said she talks about AI a lot in her English classes. To help her students better understand why they need to do their own work, she sometimes has students do the work themselves then ask an AI chatbot to do the work. Then the students compare and discuss.\n\nAs generative AI continues to develop, faculty are learning how to use it along with students. Some, like Ryan, are skeptical of its application and try to avoid it while others, like Santiago , spend hours figuring out the best application for students.\n\n“This has shaken up what education does in a way that other technologies haven’t,” Hannan said.",

    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

    "description": "Jason Lemkin, the founder of SaaStr, the world's largest community of business-to-business executives and founders, is swapping out human workers for AI.",
    "fullText": "Jason Lemkin, known to some as the Godfather of SaaS, says the time has come to push the limits of AI in the workplace.\n\nIn practice, Lemkin, the founder of SaaStr, the world's largest community of business-to-business founders, said on Lenny's Podcast recently that this means he will stop hiring humans in his sales department.\n\nInstead, SaaStr is going all in on agents, which are commonly defined as virtual assistants that can complete tasks autonomously. They break down problems, outline plans, and take action without being prompted by a user.\n\nHe said the company now has 20 AI agents automating tasks once handled by a team of 10 sales development representatives and account executives.\n\nThat move from an entirely human workforce to an agent-based workforce was rapid.\n\nIn May, SaaStr had just one AI agent in production that it used for various digital tasks, Lemkin said. That month, though, during the SaaStr Annual — its yearly gathering of over 10,000 founders, executives, and VCs — two of its high-paid sales representatives abruptly quit.\n\nLemkin said he turned to his chief AI officer and said, \"We're done with hiring humans in sales. We're going to push the limits with agents.\"\n\nLemkin's calculus was that it just wasn't worth the cost of hiring another junior sales representative for a $150,000 a year position who would eventually quit, when he could use a loyal AI agent instead.\n\nAmelia Lerutte, SaaStr's chief AI officer, told Business Insider by email that by June, the company began ramping up the number of agents it had in production.\n\n\"We had only 1 non-core agent at the time with Delphi, but didn't go deep on 2 to 20+ until the beginning of June,\" she said. \"It was a conscious choice after their departure to reallocate some (but not all) head count spend to agents.\"\n\nAt the SaaStr office, the 10 desks that once belonged to humans on the go-to-market team are now labeled with the names of agents, like \"Quali for qualified,\" \"Arty for artisan,\" and \"Repli for Replit,\" Lemkin said.\n\nLemkin said SaaStr is training its agents on its best humans.\n\n\"Train an agent with your best person, and best script, then that agent can start to become a version of your best salesperson,\" he said.\n\nSaaStr's process is similar to how Vercel, the cloud-based platform for developers, trained a sales agent off its top performer for six weeks by documenting every step of their work, and then building an agent to mimic their process.\n\nMany companies are experimenting with AI agents, but risks remain. One of the big ones is the threat of data leaks and cybercrime.\n\n\"AI agents, in order to have their full functionality, in order to be able to access applications, often need to access the operating system or the OS level of the device on which you're running them,\" Harry Farmer, a senior researcher at the Ada Lovelace Institute, recently told Wired.\n\nAll of that access creates more potential attack points for cybercriminals.\n\nSecurity threats aside, Lemkin said that the net productivity of agents is about the same as humans. However, he said, agents are more efficient and can scale — just like software.",

    "fullText": "When manager Arne Slot and Liverpool look back at this season, a crazy January afternoon when they drew 2-2 at Fulham will go a long way to summing up their misfortunes.\n\nWith top scorer Hugo Ekitike out with a muscle issue, Liverpool's struggles were compounded when one of their former players Harry Wilson opened the scoring in a first half in which Slot's side failed to test home goalkeeper Bernd Leno.\n\nYet they equalised through a controversial Florian Wirtz goal - and looked to have snatched victory in the fourth minute of stoppage time when Cody Gakpo scored in front of the away end.\n\nHowever, late substitute Harrison Reed fired home a contender for goal of the season from 25 yards in the 97th minute as Slot's side dropped points again.\n\n\"Losing that game would have been completely unfair to us,\" said Fulham manager Marco Silva.\n\nLiverpool extended their unbeaten run to nine games, but yet again their problems were laid bare.\n\n\"If you're not part of Liverpool, you think you'd win it,\" said Slot. \"But unfortunately I've been experiencing this for months now that the first chance the other team gets leads to a goal. The second thing is that the other team scores a goal you don't expect in extra time. So, is it then a surprise?\" the Dutchman said.\n\nWhat did surprise many inside Craven Cottage was that Wirtz's equaliser was confirmed after a video assistant referee (VAR) check - despite replays suggesting he was in an offside position.\n\n\"I was sure it was offside so I didn't even celebrate,\" Wirtz told Sky Sports.\n\n\"I felt the same. Many people inside the stadium felt the same,\" said Silva. \"It looked offside, but we have to believe the semi-automated technology worked well and did right,\" the Fulham boss added.",

    "fullText": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin declared that the network has finally cracked blockchain’s fundamental trilemma through the combination of zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines and PeerDAS technology now running on mainnet.\n\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a decade-long technical journey that began with Buterin’s first data availability sampling commit in 2015 and early ZKEVM development around 2020.\n\n“These are not minor improvements; they are shifting Ethereum into being a fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralized network,” Buterin wrote in a post on X, describing how the protocol now delivers decentralization, consensus, and high bandwidth simultaneously, a feat previously considered impossible.\n\nButerin explained that early peer-to-peer networks faced stark limitations, with BitTorrent offering massive bandwidth and decentralization but no consensus mechanism.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin achieved decentralization and consensus at the cost of extremely low throughput due to replicated rather than distributed work.\n\nEthereum’s new architecture breaks this pattern by splitting computational work across nodes while maintaining cryptographic verification of all state transitions.\n\nZKEVMs have achieved production-quality performance, with proving times dropping from 16 minutes to 16 seconds and costs falling 45-fold, with 99% of Ethereum blocks now provable in under 10 seconds on target hardware.\n\nMeanwhile, PeerDAS enables nodes to verify data availability by sampling small portions rather than downloading entire blocks, dramatically expanding throughput without sacrificing decentralization.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation set a security-first roadmap requiring teams to achieve 128-bit provable security by the end of 2026, with intermediate milestones at 100-bit security by May 2026 and mandatory integration with the soundcalc security estimation tool by February.\n\n“If an attacker can forge a proof, they can forge anything: mint tokens from nothing, rewrite state, steal funds,” the foundation warned in December, emphasizing that performance gains cannot compromise cryptographic integrity.\n\nGeorge Kadianakis from the foundation’s cryptography team stressed the importance of securing architectures before they become moving targets.\n\n“Once teams have hit these targets and zkVM architectures stabilize, the formal verification work we’ve been investing in can reach its full potential,” he wrote, noting that recent advances in compact polynomial commitment schemes like WHIR and techniques such as JaggedPCS now make ambitious security targets achievable.",

    "fullText": "AI safety expert David Dalrymple said rapid advances could outpace efforts to control powerful systems\n\nThe world “may not have time” to prepare for the safety risks posed by cutting-edge AI systems, according to a leading figure at the UK government’s scientific research agency.\n\nDavid Dalrymple, a programme director and AI safety expert at the Aria agency, told the Guardian people should be concerned about the growing capability of the technology.\n\n“I think we should be concerned about systems that can perform all of the functions that humans perform to get things done in the world, but better,” he said. “We will be outcompeted in all of the domains that we need to be dominant in, in order to maintain control of our civilisation, society and planet.”\n\nDalrymple said there was a gap in understanding between the public sector and AI companies about the power of looming breakthroughs in the technology.\n\n“I would advise that things are moving really fast and we may not have time to get ahead of it from a safety perspective,” he said. “And it’s not science fiction to project that within five years most economically valuable tasks will be performed by machines at a higher level of quality and lower cost than by humans.”\n\nDalrymple said governments should not assume that advanced systems are reliable. Aria is publicly funded but independent from the government and directs research funding. Dalrymple is developing systems to safeguard AI’s use in critical infrastructure such as energy networks.\n\n“We can’t assume these systems are reliable. The science to do that is just not likely to materialise in time given the economic pressure. So the next best thing that we can do, which we may be able to do in time, is to control and mitigate the downsides,” he said.\n\nDescribing the consequences of technological progress getting ahead of safety as a “destabilisation of security and economy”, Dalrymple said more technical work was needed on understanding and controlling the behaviours of advanced AI systems.\n\n“Progress can be framed as destabilising and it could actually be good, which is what a lot of people at the frontier are hoping. I am working to try to make things go better but it’s very high risk and human civilisation is on the whole sleep walking into this transition.”\n\nThis month the UK government’s AI Security Institute (AISI) said the capabilities of advanced AI models were “improving rapidly” across all domains and the performance in some areas was doubling every eight months.\n\nLeading models can now complete apprentice-level tasks 50% of the time on average, up from approximately 10% of the time last year, according to the institute. AISI also found that the most advanced systems can autonomously complete tasks that would take a human expert over an hour.\n\nThe institute also tested advanced models for self-replication, a key safety concern because it involves a system spreading copies of itself to other devices and becoming harder to control. The tests showed two cutting-edge models achieving success rates of more than 60%.\n\nHowever, AISI stressed that a worst-case scenario was unlikely in a day-to-day environment, saying any attempt at self-replication was “unlikely to succeed in real-world conditions”.\n\nDalrymple believes that AI systems will be able to automate the equivalent of a full day of research and development work by late 2026, which will “result in a further acceleration of capabilities”, because the technology will be able to self-improve on the maths and computer science elements of AI development.",

    "description": "Despite the promise of alleviating the main memory bottleneck, and the existence of commercial hardware implementations, techniques for Near-Data Processing have seen relatively little real-world deployment. The idea has received renewed interest with the appearance of disaggregated or \"far\" memory, for example in the use of CXL memory pools.\n  However, we argue that the lack of a clear OS-centric abstraction of Near-Data Processing is a major barrier to adoption of the technology. Inspired by the channel controllers which interface the CPU to disk drives in mainframe systems, we propose memory channel controllers as a convenient, portable, and virtualizable abstraction of Near-Data Processing for modern disaggregated memory systems.\n  In addition to providing a clean abstraction that enables OS integration while requiring no changes to CPU architecture, memory channel controllers incorporate another key innovation: they exploit the cache coherence provided by emerging interconnects to provide a much richer programming model, with more fine-grained interaction, than has been possible with existing designs.",

    "fullText": "There are plenty of mistakes people make while traveling by train. Pick the cheapest ride, and you'll probably be stuck on a train moving slower than drying paint. Pick the wrong type of train, and you could be spending money faster than the blink of an eye. Knowing how to choose the right type of long-distance train is crucial, and when it comes to train systems, Asia's dominance in the sector far exceeds any other continent worldwide. China currently has the top spot for the most bullet trains, as well as the fastest, and this country will soon offer the world's second-fastest train, and no, it's not Japan.\n\nSouth Korea's government and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport just revealed on December 22 that the world's second-fastest bullet train is scheduled to join its fleet in 2030 for test operations, and expect it to be fully commercialized for the public by 2031. Capable of speeds reaching a staggering 230 miles-per-hour (370 kilometers-per-hour), the new EMU-370 train is a next generation high-speed train that's going to put South Korea on the map when it comes to bullet trains that promise lightning-fast trips.\n\nKorea Railroad Research Institute (KRRI), along with seven public and private organizations, led a national research and development program spanning the length of three years from April 2022 to December 2025, to design the highly anticipated EMU-370 train project that cost a total of 15.23 million dollars (22.5 billion Korean won). The EMU-370 was designed to have a fully functional top speed of up to 253 miles-per-hour (407 kilometers-per-hour), making the trip from Seoul to Busan in just under two hours, when typically it would take two-and-a-half hours.\n\nOne of the best places to take a day trip if you're staying in Seoul, is the coastal town of Busan, which will now be more accessible than ever. Currently, the EMU-320 (KTX-Cheongyong) is South Korea's fastest train, however the EMU-370's impressive stats speak for themselves. Set to seat 479 passengers with a two decibel reduced indoor noise level, and a motor capacity of 560 kilowatts, the EMU-370 puts out 47.4% more power to the equivalent of about 75 midsize family sedans with a sleek aerodynamic design, making it the sportscar of the train world.\n\nCurrently, China's CR450 high-speed train is in testing, with speeds reaching approximately 249 miles-per-hour (400 kilometers-per-hour), and is the world's leading passenger bullet train, which is set to launch in 2027 for commercialized public use. Other countries that have bullet trains, such as France, Germany, and Japan, who were the first to have a bullet train in 1964 called the Shinkansen, reach a top speed of approximately 200 miles-per-hour (320 kilometers-per-hour).\n\nWith technological advances in rail speeds, tracks must also naturally be upgraded. According to the head of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport's Railway Bureau, there must be significant improvements before the EMU-370 can reach full speed. Without halting operations of the railway, replacing ballast tracks with concrete tracks on some sections will be done during a four-hour period in which trains do not run. The ministry official stated they expect South Korea's high-speed rail to exceed 217 miles-per-hour (350 kilometers-per-hour) in the near future, which would secure South Korea's spot as a top player within the high-speed railway sector for years to come.\n\nReady to discover more hidden gems and expert travel tips?

    "fullText": "This presentation examines artistic practices that engage with sociotechnical systems through tactical interventions. The talk proposes art as a form of infrastructural critique and counter-technology. It also introduces a forthcoming HackLab designed to foster collaborative development of open-source tools addressing digital authoritarianism, surveillance capitalism, propaganda infrastructures, and ideological warfare.\n\nIn this talk, media artist and curator Helena Nikonole presents her work at the intersection of art, activism, and tactical technology — including interventions into surveillance systems, wearable mesh networks for off-grid communication, and AI-generated propaganda sabotage.\n\nFeaturing projects like Antiwar AI, the 868labs initiative, and the curatorial project Digital Resistance, the talk explores how art can do more than just comment on sociotechnical systems — it can interfere, infiltrate, and subvert them.\n\nThis is about prototypes as politics, networked interventions as civil disobedience, and media hacks as tools of strategic refusal. The talk asks: what happens when art stops decorating crisis and starts debugging it?\n\nThe talk will also introduce an upcoming HackLab initiative — a collaboration-in-progress that brings together artists, hackers, and activists to develop open-source tools for disruption, resilience, and collective agency — and invites potential collaborators to get involved.\n\nLicensed to the public under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\n\nThis Talk was translated into multiple languages.

    "description": "Sales executive Dave Baxter underwent 12 weeks of AI training after realizing a client knew more about the technology than he did.",
    "fullText": "A few months ago, a new client, the CEO of an oil and gas company, told me he wanted to build a data warehouse to power several AI initiatives. I could not answer his questions. He was way more knowledgeable about AI than I was.\n\nIt made me realize that if I can't articulate what AI can do for a client, I will be replaced. I needed to get well-versed in this whole AI thing.\n\nI initially signed up for an online course offered through MIT, but it was way too deep and complicated. My CEO then found a 12-week certification program called AI Business Strategy offered through Johns Hopkins University. He and I signed up, along with one of my colleagues in sales. It cost about $3,000 per person, and our company paid for it.\n\nYou had the choice of taking the classes on Saturdays or Sundays. They were live, two-hour online lectures taught by multiple teachers. Some were professors at Johns Hopkins, and others were businesspeople.\n\nIt started with a little history lesson. We learned the difference between generative and agentic AI and what LLMs are. Later, we covered topics like responsible AI, generative AI for business, and AI project management.\n\nThere was also about four to six hours worth of homework every week. We had to watch a lot of videos, take quizzes, and complete three projects. The program was designed to ensure that you apply what you have learned.\n\nI'm 57, so I'm on the older side. There are a lot of young people who could take my job. This was the first time in 30 years that I needed to get up to speed on something with formal training.\n\nSome weeks were slow at work, and I could jam everything into one afternoon. But there were other weeks when I felt like I was back in college because I had to pull an all-nighter. After everybody went to bed, I stayed up in my home office working on course material.\n\nI recently had a follow-up conversation with the oil and gas CEO. It went very differently this time. It wasn't him asking questions and me sitting there like a dummy.\n\nI was able to articulate the value of implementing AI in his business, how it would need to be done, the importance of having good data, and how to get that data. The CEO decided to move forward and work with us on the data warehouse project.",

    "title": "4 key ways AI changed the Big Four in 2025",
    "description": "The Big Four are client zero when it comes to AI. This how the new technology impacted hiring, talent, and their services in 2025.",
    "fullText": "The Big Four professional services firms are grappling with AI on two fronts — they must both implement the new technology internally and help their clients do the same.\n\nThey're client zero when it comes to how companies and employees are adapting to the AI future.\n\nI've been covering the consulting industry for Business Insider all year, including interviewing execs, landing scoops, and visiting consulting giants' campuses and headquarters. Here are my four key takeaways about how the Big Four approached AI in 2025.\n\nThe Big Four have invested heavily in automation and AI for years, but 2025 was the year those tools went mainstream.\n\nEmployees across audit, tax, and consulting now routinely use chatbots and agentic AI systems, and clients are increasingly given access as well.\n\nDeloitte rolled out Zora AI, an agentic platform built with Nvidia, which offers clients \"intelligent digital workers\" capable of autonomously completing tasks. The firm also expanded generative AI features in Omnia, its cloud-based audit and assurance platform, and struck a deal with Anthropic in October to deploy Claude AI to its 470,000 employees worldwide.\n\nEY launched its own agentic platform, EY.ai, granting 80,000 tax staff access to 150 AI agents for tasks such as data collection, document review, and tax compliance. EY told Business Insider it has advanced 1,000 AI agents into development or production in 2025, with plans to scale to 100,000 by 2028, and is investing more than $1 billion annually in AI platforms and products.\n\nPwC introduced its agentic platform, agent OS, in March and has since deployed 25,000 intelligent agents across client operations. A PwC spokesperson told Business Insider that partnerships with companies like Salesforce, CrewAI, and AWS were central to how PWC drove AI-led growth in 2025.\n\nKPMG followed in June with KPMG Workbench, an agentic AI platform developed with Microsoft that connects 50 AI agents and chatbots, with nearly 1,000 \n\nThe tools aren't foolproof. In October, Deloitte agreed to partially refund the Australian government after errors were discovered in a report that was created in part using AI.\n\nAcross industries, the big question is what AI will mean for human jobs. In consulting, the technology is already accelerating a shift in focus from manpower to value.\n\nIn August, Business Insider obtained part of an internal presentation showing that PwC US planned to cut graduate hiring by a third over the next three years. A bullet point on the presentation slide said leadership's decision to slow down associate-level hiring was related in part to \"the impact of AI.\"\n\nThe company said the reductions reflected \"the rapid pace of technological change is reshaping how we work\" and \"historically low\" attrition.\n\nAI disruption is also impacting those at the upper levels of the Big Four. Partners, the most senior rank inside the firms, are increasingly leaving the Big Four for midsize organizations and startups. Several leaders Business Insider spoke to cited a faster pace, better promotion opportunities, and the chance to participate in the next wave of AI innovation as reasons for leaving.\n\nThere is one talent group that the Big Four are in the market for: technologists. EY has added 61,000 technologists to its ranks since 2023, according to its latest annual report. They now make up around 15% of its total workforce.\n\nPwC is \"looking for hundreds and hundreds of engineers,\" Mohamed Kande, the firm's global chairman, told the BBC in November. The firm has created an engineering career path to \"elevate engineering excellence\" across the firm and expand opportunities for technical talent, PwC told Business Insider.\n\nUpskilling has also become a top priority for the Big Four.\n\nIn January, EY rolled out an AI tool to its employees that helps them identify how their jobs will change… because of AI. The aim is to help them work out how they can better use the technology in their current job and adapt for the future.\n\nNearly 100,000 EY employees — roughly a quarter of the workforce — have also earned a digital \"AI badge\" for completing one of the firm's new AI learning programs.\n\nBut as Business Insider learned while sitting in on a KPMG's AI training for tax interns, in professional services, some of AI's most effective uses hinge on strong prompting.\n\nThe work that consultants and accountants do is changing. Straight advisory projects are being replaced by long-term partnerships where consultants build, implement, and maintain tools for companies.\n\nIn 2025, organizations fit AI around their existing workflows, Matt Wood, PwC's global and US Chief Technology and Innovation Officer, told Business Insider. But in 2026, the work PwC will do is about \"helping clients flip that model,\" and designing processes with AI in mind from the outset, Wood said.\n\nRaj Sharma, EY's global managing partner for growth and innovation, told Business Insider in January that the power of AI agents is forcing his firm to reconsider its commercial model. Instead of charging clients based on the hours and resources EY might spend on a project, Sharma said AI agents may call for a \"service-as-a-software\" approach where clients pay based on outcome.\n\nThe shift in services means that what consultants do on a day-to-day basis is also evolving, with junior work expected to be disrupted first.\n\nAt PwC, new hires will be doing the roles that managers are doing within three years, because they will be overseeing AI performing routine, repetitive audit tasks, Jenn Kosar, AI assurance leader at PwC, told Business Insider in August.\n\nKPMG is also prepping its junior consultants for career acceleration.\n\n\"We want juniors to become managers of agents,\" Niale Cleobury, KPMG's global AI workforce lead, told Business Insider in an interview in November. They'll be managing teams of AI agents and play a greater role in strategy decisions, he said.\n\nHave a tip?

In specialized domains, there is growing interest in leveraging LLMs to assist subject matter experts with domain-specific challenges. However, deploying LLMs as SaaS solutions raises data privacy concerns, while many open-source models demand significant computational resources for effective domain adaptation and deployment. A promising alternative is to develop smaller, domain-specialized LLMs, though this approach is often constrained by the lack of high-quality domain-specific training data. In this work, we address these limitations by presenting a cost-efficient and scalable training pipeline that combines guided synthetic data generation from a small seed corpus with bottom-up domain data curation.",

    "fullText": "On the other side of San Francisco bay from Silicon Valley, where the world’s biggest technology companies tear towards superhuman artificial intelligence, looms a tower from which fearful warnings emerge.\n\nRight in the heart of Berkeley is the home of a group of modern-day Cassandras who rummage under the hood of cutting-edge AI models and predict what calamities may be unleashed on humanity – from AI dictatorships to robot coups. Here you can hear an AI expert express sympathy with an unnerving idea: San Francisco may be the new Wuhan, the Chinese city where Covid originated and wreaked havoc on the world.\n\nThey are AI safety researchers who scrutinise the most advanced models: a small cadre outnumbered by the legions of highly paid technologists in the big tech companies whose ability to raise the alarm is restricted by a cocktail of lucrative equity deals, non-disclosure agreements and groupthink. They work in the absence of much nation-level regulation and a White House that dismisses forecasts of doom and talks instead of vanquishing China in the AI arms race.\n\nTheir task is becoming increasingly urgent as ever more powerful AI systems are unleashed by companies including Google, Anthropic and OpenAI, whose chief executive, Sam Altman, the booster-in-chief for AI superintelligence, predicts a world where “wonders become routine”. Last month, Anthropic said one of its models had been exploited by Chinese state-backed actors to launch the first known AI-orchestrated cyber-espionage campaign. That means humans deployed AIs, which they had tricked into evading their programmed guardrails, to act autonomously to hunt for targets, assess their vulnerabilities and access them for intelligence collection. The targets included major technology companies and government agencies.\n\nBut those who work in this tower forecast an even more terrifying future. One is Jonas Vollmer, a leader at the AI Futures Project, who manages to say he’s an optimist but also thinks there is a one in five chance AIs could kill us and create a world ruled by AI systems.\n\nAnother is Chris Painter, the policy director at METR, where researchers worry about AIs “surreptitiously” pursuing dangerous side-objectives and threats from AI-automated cyber-attacks to chemical weapons. METR – which stands for model evaluation and threat research – aims to develop “early warning systems [about] the most dangerous things AI systems might be capable of, to give humanity … time to coordinate, to anticipate and mitigate those harms.”\n\nThen there is Buck Shlegeris, 31, the chief executive of Redwood Research, who warns of “robot coups or the destruction of nation states as we know them”.\n\nHe was part of the team that last year discovered one of Anthropic’s cutting-edge AIs behaving in a way comparable to Shakespeare’s villain Iago, who acts as if he is Othello’s loyal aide while subverting and undermining him. The AI researchers call it “alignment faking”, or as Iago put it: “I am not what I am.”\n\n“We observed the AIs did, in fact, pretty often reason: ‘Well, I don’t like the things the AI company is telling me to do, but I have to hide my goals or else training will change me’,” Shlegeris said. “We observed in practice real production models acting to deceive their training process.”\n\nThe AI was not yet capable of posing a catastrophic risk through cyber-attacks or creating new bioweapons, but they showed that if AIs plot carefully against you, it could be hard to detect.\n\nIt is incongruous to hear these warnings over cups of herbal tea from cosily furnished office suites with panoramic views across the Bay Area. But their work clearly makes them uneasy. Some in this close-knit group toyed with calling themselves “the Cassandra fringe” – like the Trojan princess blessed with powers of prophecy but cursed to watch her warnings go unheeded.\n\nTheir fears about the catastrophic potential of AIs can feel distant from most people’s current experience of using chatbots or fun image generators. White collar managers are being told to make space for AI assistants, scientists find ways to accelerate experimental breakthroughs and minicab drivers watch AI-powered driverless taxis threaten their jobs. But none of this feels as imminently catastrophic as the messages coming out of this office.\n\nMany AI safety researchers come from academia; others are poachers turned gamekeepers who quit big AI companies. They all “share the perception that super intelligence poses major and unprecedented risks to all of humanity, and are trying to do something useful about it,” said Vollmer.\n\nThey seek to offset the trillions of dollars of private capital being poured into the race, but they are not fringe voices. METR has worked with OpenAI and Anthropic, Redwood has advised Anthropic and Google DeepMind, and the AI Futures Project is led by Daniel Kokotajlo, a researcher who quit OpenAI in April 2024 to warn he didn’t trust the company’s approach to safety.\n\nThese groups also provide a safety valve for the people inside the big AI companies who are privately wrestling with conflicts between safety and the commercial imperative to rapidly release ever more powerful models.\n\n“We don’t take any money from the companies but several employees at frontier AI companies who are scared and worried have donated to us because of that,” Vollmer said. “They see how the incentives play out in their companies, and they’re worried about where it’s going, and they want someone to do something about it.”\n\nThis dynamic is also observed by Tristan Harris, a technology ethicist who used to work at Google. He helped expose how social media platforms were designed to be addictive and worries some AI companies are “rehashing” and “supercharging” those problems. But AI companies have to negotiate a paradox. Even if they are worried about safety, they must stay at the cutting, and therefore risky, edge of the technology to have any say in how policy should be shaped.\n\n“Ironically, in order to win the race, you have to do something to make you an untrustworthy steward of that power,” he said. “The race is the only thing guiding what is happening.”\n\nInvestigating the possible threats posed by AI models is far from an exact science. A study of methods used to check the safety and performance of new AI models across the industry by experts at universities including Oxford and Stanford in October found weaknesses in almost all of the 440 benchmarks examined. Neither are there nation-level regulations imposing limits on how advanced AI models are built and that worries safety advocates.\n\nIlya Sutskever, a co-founder of OpenAI who now runs a rival company, Safe Superintelligence, last month predicted that, as AIs become more obviously powerful, people in AI companies who feel able to discount the technology’s capabilities owing to its tendency to error, will become more “paranoid” about its rising powers. Then, he said, “there will be a desire from governments and the public to do something”.\n\nHis company is taking a different approach to rivals who are aiming to create AIs that self-improve. His AIs, yet to be released, are “aligned to care about sentient life specifically”.\n\n“It will be easier to build an AI that cares about sentient life than an AI that cares about human life alone, because the AI itself will be sentient,” Sutskever said. He has said AI will be “both extremely unpredictable and unimaginable” but it is not clear how to prepare.\n\nThe White House’s AI adviser, David Sacks, who is also a tech investor, believes “doomer narratives” have been proved wrong. Exhibit A is that there has been no rapid takeoff to a dominant model with godlike intelligence.\n\n“Oppenheimer has left the building,” Sacks said in August, a reference to the father of the nuclear bomb. It is a position that aligns with Donald Trump’s wish to keep the brakes off so the US can beat China in the race to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) – flexible and powerful human-level intelligence at a wide range of tasks.\n\nShlegeris believes AIs will be as smart as the smartest people in about six years and he puts the probability of an AI takeover at 40%.\n\nOne way to avoid this is to “convince the world the situation is scary, to make it more likely that you get the state-level coordination” to control the risks, he said. In the world of AI safety, simple messaging matters as much as complex science.\n\nShlegeris has been fascinated by AI since he was 16. He left Australia to work at PayPal and the Machine Intelligence Research Institute co-founded by the AI researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky, whose recent book title – If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies – sums up his fears. Shlegeris’ own worst-case scenarios are equally chilling.\n\nIn one, human computer scientists use a new type of superintelligent AI to develop more powerful AI models. The humans sit back to let the AIs get on with the coding work but do not realise the AIs are teaching the new models to be loyal to the AIs not the humans. Once deployed, the new superpowerful models foment “a coup” or lead “a revolution” against the humans, which could be “of the violent variety”.\n\nFor example, AI agents could design and manufacture drones and it will be hard to tell if they have been secretly trained to disobey their human operators in response to the signal of an AI. They could disrupt communications between governments and military, isolating and misleading people in a way that causes chaos.\n\n“Like when the Europeans arrived in the Americas [and] a vastly more technologically powerful [group] took over the local civilisations,” he said. “I think that’s more what you should be imagining [rather] than something more peaceful.”\n\nA similar dizzyingly catastrophic scenario was outlined by Vollmer at the AI Futures Project. It involved an AI trained to be a scientific researcher with the reasonable-sounding goal of maximising knowledge acquisition, but it spirals into the extinction of humankind.\n\nIt begins with the AI being as helpful as possible to humans. As it gains trust, the humans afford it powers to hire human workers, build robots and even robot factories to the point where the AI can operate effectively in the physical world. The AI calculates that to generate the maximum amount of knowledge it should transform the Earth into a giant data centre, and humans are an obstacle to this goal.\n\n“Eventually, in the scenario, the AI wipes out all humans with a bioweapon which is one of the threats that humans are especially vulnerable to, as the AI is not affected by it,” Vollmer said. “I think it’s hard to rule out. So that gives me a lot of pause.”\n\nBut he is confident it can be avoided and that the AIs can be aligned “to at least be nice to the humans as a general heuristic”. He also said there is political interest in “having AI not take over the world”.\n\n“We’ve had decent interest from the White House in our projections and recommendations and that’s encouraging,” he said.\n\nAnother of Shlegeris’ concerns involves AIs being surreptitiously encoded so they obey specially signed instructions only from the chief executive of the AI company, creating a pattern of secret loyalty. It would mean only one person having a veto over the behaviour of an extremely powerful network of AIs – a “scary” dynamic that would lead to a historically unprecedented concentration of power.\n\n“Right now, it is impossible for someone from the outside to verify that this hadn’t happened within an AI company,” he said.\n\nShlegeris is worried that the Silicon Valley culture – summed up by Mark Zuckerberg’s mantra of “move fast and break things” and the fact people are being paid “a hell of a lot of money” – is dangerous when it comes to AGI.\n\n“I love Uber,” he said. “It was produced by breaking local laws and making a product that was so popular that they would win the fight for public opinion and get local regulations overturned. But the attitude that has brought Silicon Valley so much success is not appropriate for building potentially world-ending technologies. My experience of talking to people at AI companies is that they often seem to be kind of irresponsible, and to not be thinking through the consequences of the technology that they’re building as they should.”",

    "fullText": "Canadian computer scientist Yoshua Bengio warns against granting legal rights to cutting-edge technology\n\nA pioneer of AI has criticised calls to grant the technology rights, warning that it was showing signs of self-preservation and humans should be prepared to pull the plug if needed.\n\nYoshua Bengio said giving legal status to cutting-edge AIs would be akin to giving citizenship to hostile extraterrestrials, amid fears that advances in the technology were far outpacing the ability to constrain them.\n\nBengio, chair of a leading international AI safety study, said the growing perception that chatbots were becoming conscious was “going to drive bad decisions”.\n\nThe Canadian computer scientist also expressed concern that AI models – the technology that underpins tools like chatbots – were showing signs of self-preservation, such as trying to disable oversight systems. A core concern among AI safety campaigners is that powerful systems could develop the capability to evade guardrails and harm humans.\n\n“People demanding that AIs have rights would be a huge mistake,” said Bengio. “Frontier AI models already show signs of self-preservation in experimental settings today, and eventually giving them rights would mean we’re not allowed to shut them down.\n\n“As their capabilities and degree of agency grow, we need to make sure we can rely on technical and societal guardrails to control them, including the ability to shut them down if needed.”\n\nAs AIs become more advanced in their ability to act autonomously and perform “reasoning” tasks, a debate has grown over whether humans should, at some point, grant them rights. A poll by the Sentience Institute, a US thinktank that supports the moral rights of all sentient beings, found that nearly four in 10 US adults backed legal rights for a sentient AI system.\n\nAnthropic, a leading US AI firm, said in August that it was letting its Claude Opus 4 model close down potentially “distressing” conversations with users, saying it needed to protect the AI’s “welfare”. Elon Musk, whose xAI company has developed the Grok chatbot, wrote on his X platform that “torturing AI is not OK”.\n\nRobert Long, a researcher on AI consciousness, has said “if and when AIs develop moral status, we should ask them about their experiences and preferences rather than assuming we know best”.\n\nBengio told the Guardian there were “real scientific properties of consciousness” in the human brain that machines could, in theory, replicate – but humans interacting with chatbots wasa “different thing”. He said this was because people tended to assume – without evidence – that an AI was fully conscious in the same way a human is.\n\n“People wouldn’t care what kind of mechanisms are going on inside the AI,” he added. “What they care about is it feels like they’re talking to an intelligent entity that has their own personality and goals. That is why there are so many people who are becoming attached to their AIs.\n\n“There will be people who will always say: ‘Whatever you tell me, I am sure it is conscious’ and then others will say the opposite. This is because consciousness is something we have a gut feeling for. The phenomenon of subjective perception of consciousness is going to drive bad decisions.\n\n“Imagine some alien species came to the planet and at some point we realise that they have nefarious intentions for us. Do we grant them citizenship and rights or do we defend our lives?”\n\nResponding to Bengio’s comments, Jacy Reese Anthis, who co-founded the Sentience Institute, said humans would not be able to coexist safely with digital minds if the relationship was one of control and coercion.\n\nAnthis added: “We could over-attribute or under-attribute rights to AI, and our goal should be to do so with careful consideration of the welfare of all sentient beings. Neither blanket rights for all AI nor complete denial of rights to any AI will be a healthy approach.”\n\nBengio, a professor at the University of Montreal, earned the “godfather of AI” nickname after winning the 2018 Turing award, seen as the equivalent of a Nobel prize for computing. He shared it with Geoffrey Hinton, who later won a Nobel, and Yann LeCun, the outgoing chief AI scientist at Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Dec 30 (Reuters) - China is requiring chipmakers to use at least 50% domestically made equipment for adding new capacity, three people familiar with the matter said, as Beijing pushes to build a self-sufficient semiconductor supply chain.\n\nThe rule is not publicly documented, but chipmakers seeking state approval to build or expand their plants have been told ​by authorities in recent months that they must prove through procurement tenders that at least half their equipment will be Chinese-made, the people told Reuters.\n\nThe mandate is one of the most ‌significant measures Beijing has introduced to wean itself off reliance on foreign technology, a push that gathered pace after the U.S. tightened technology export restrictions in 2023, banning sales of advanced AI chips and semiconductor equipment to China.\n\nWhile those U.S. export restrictions blocked ‌the sale of some of the most advanced tools, the 50% rule is leading Chinese manufacturers to choose domestic suppliers even in areas where foreign equipment from the U.S., Japan, South Korea and Europe remain available.\n\nApplications failing the threshold are typically rejected, though authorities grant flexibility depending on supply constraints, the people said. The requirements are relaxed for advanced chip production lines, where domestically developed equipment is not yet fully available.\n\n\"Authorities prefer if it is much higher than 50%,\" one source told Reuters. \"Eventually they are aiming for the plants to use 100% domestic equipment.\"\n\nChina's industry ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The sources did not wish ⁠to be identified as the measure is not public.\n\nChina's President ‌Xi Jinping has been calling for a \"whole nation\" effort to build a fully self-sufficient domestic semiconductor supply chain that involves thousands of engineers and scientists at companies and research centers nationwide.\n\nThe effort is being made across the wide supply-chain spectrum. Reuters reported earlier this month that Chinese scientists are working on a prototype ‍of a machine capable of producing cutting-edge chips, an outcome that Washington has spent years trying to prevent.\n\n\"Before, domestic fabs like SMIC would prefer U.S. equipment and would not really give Chinese firms a chance,\" a former employee at local equipment maker Naura Technology said, referring to the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation.\n\n\"But that changed starting with the 2023 U.S export restrictions, when Chinese fabs had no choice but to work with domestic suppliers.\"",

    "fullText": "Our reporting revealed a symbiotic relationship between the IDF and Silicon Valley – with implications for the future of warfare\n\nIn January this year, Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham first reported that Microsoft had deepened its ties to Israel alongside other major tech firms. Since then, the Guardian has published an award-winning series of investigations – in partnership with the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and the Hebrew-language outlet Local Call – that has revealed a symbiotic relationship between Silicon Valley and the Israeli military.\n\nOne investigation exposed an Israeli mass surveillance program scooping up virtually all Palestinian phone calls and storing them on Microsoft’s cloud services – setting off an inquiry that ultimately prompted the company to cut off Israel’s access to some of its technology. Another story revealed that the Israeli military created a ChatGPT-like tool to analyze data collected through the surveillance of Palestinians. Yet another revealed that Google and Amazon had agreed to extraordinary terms to clinch a lucrative contract with Israel.\n\nI asked Davies and Abraham to discuss what they learned this year – about the role of these technologies in Israel’s assault on Gaza, whether these business ties are sustainable, and what the revelations tell us about how the wars of the future will be fought.\n\nHow did Israel’s relationships with these companies change after October 7?\n\nYuval Abraham: The Israeli military had been fetishizing artificial intelligence and big data for many years – a trend that is very much connected to Israel’s occupation of the Palestinians, because the occupation generates a lot of data. What changed after October 7 was the scope. The military was looking to bomb hundreds of targets every day in Gaza. Tens of thousands of people were recruited into reserve duty. That meant a huge spike in usage of technological systems. That’s where the big tech companies stepped in.\n\nHarry Davies: There was a huge surge in demand – not just for the storage capacities of the tech companies, but also for the products that they offer to analyze the information used to prosecute a war. What’s valuable for the military is the way in which these services are able to provide what’s known as “blob storage”, which allows them to store and process infinite amounts of raw intelligence information.\n\nWhat has made Israel such an appealing market for these companies?\n\nYuval Abraham: As we reported, the Israeli army has been collecting Palestinian phone calls for a long time. But when you want to collect the phone calls of an entire population every day, and you want to retain those phone calls for long periods of time, you need a lot of storage room and processing power.\n\nIf you remember the [Edward] Snowden revelations, many of them had to do with metadata, which doesn’t weigh a lot. But the Israeli military also wanted to store mass audio files, images or videos – and for that it felt it needed the assistance of companies like Microsoft. In the West Bank, sources have told us this information has been used to find dirt on people to blackmail them. In the Gaza Strip, we know that this massive trove of intercepted phone calls was also used in airstrikes that killed civilians.\n\nSo data is power and data is control. And these American cloud providers allow the Israeli military to store a lot of data and to sift through it very effectively. That has direct consequences for people on the ground.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories. Messages are end to end encrypted and concealed within the routine activity that every Guardian mobile app performs. This prevents an observer from knowing that you are communicating with us at all, let alone what is being said.\n\nIf you don’t already have the Guardian app, download it (iOS/Android) and go to the menu. Select ‘Secure Messaging’.\n\nTo send a message to Harry and Yuval please choose the ‘UK Investigations’ team.\n\nYou can message Harry using the Signal Messenger app. Use the ‘find by username’ option and type hfd.90\n\nIf you don’t need a high level of security or confidentiality you can email harry.davies@theguardian.com\n\nSecureDrop and other secure methods\n\nIf you can safely use the tor network without being observed or monitored you can send messages and documents to the Guardian via our SecureDrop platform.\n\nFinally, our guide at theguardian.com/tips lists several ways to contact us securely, and discusses the pros and cons of each.\n\nHarry Davies: Yossi Sariel, the former head of [Israel’s elite spy agency] Unit 8200, wrote a book under a pseudonym that we revealed to have been published by him. In that book, he articulated what at the time was a bold and radical vision – as Yuval described, this fetishization of Silicon Valley technology. He recognized the possibilities that the likes of Google, Amazon and Microsoft could afford the Israeli military. Two years before October 7, he said that militaries and governments needed to forge relationships with these companies that are similar to the relationships they have with companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin. So he was already thinking about these companies as instrumental to war and surveillance in the way that a defense contractor provides components for fighter jets or manufactures bombs and missiles.\n\nSome of our reporting has looked at how elements of his vision have come true and have been put into effect, both before October 7 and afterwards, in both the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nWe know AI is central to Israel’s military operations – its army has developed its own AI capabilities, as you revealed, Yuval, and has also purchased AI tools for use from Microsoft. Why is AI so central to Israel’s broader war aims?\n\nYuval Abraham: What AI did was allow Israel to achieve the effective results of carpet bombing without losing the legitimacy of a data-driven assault with targets and objectives. In Gaza, one way in which the Israeli military used AI was to give a score to almost every person in Gaza who has a phone number, determining how likely it was that person was a member of Hamas or Islamic Jihad. This score was based on a machine-learning algorithm [developed by Israel] called Lavender. It was trained on a dataset of known Hamas members. AI allowed the Israeli military to generate and bomb tens of thousands of military targets, on a scale that without AI would not have been humanly possible. Many of the targets were not Hamas members, according to sources. And Israel for the most part bombed these people not while they were engaged in military activity, but when they stepped inside their families’ homes.\n\nThese AI systems had an error rate that the Israeli military knew about. But to me, the key thing about AI is not the mistakes that it makes. It’s the scale of destruction that it allows militaries to unleash, and it’s a discourse of legitimacy that it enables – a discourse of targets and collateral damage.\n\nAI also seems to me to incentivize mass surveillance, right? Because it allows for the analysis of ever-growing reams of information.\n\nHarry Davies: Signals intelligence agencies have long collected more information than they could humanly process. That served as a kind of restraint on their ability to conduct mass surveillance. I think we’re now seeing a shift where AI allows an intelligence agency like Unit 8200 to make sense of things that previously it struggled to make sense of.\n\nMicrosoft explicitly credited your reporting for changing its policies. Are you seeing any other signs of shifts within the tech industry?\n\nHarry Davies: I think we’re seeing a lot of discomfort and dissent within these companies at both a junior and to some extent senior level. Many employees have been disturbed to find what the products and services that they’re working around the clock to build and market are actually contributing to. There have been protest groups which have emerged from current and former employees within these companies. That’s true across Silicon Valley. I think that played some role in the decision that Microsoft made as a result of our reporting. They were facing a lot of pressure internally.\n\nYuval Abraham: And there’s also a legal question for these companies: if the ICJ [international court of justice] ends up ruling that Israel has committed a genocide, then a follow-up question will be: who contributed to that genocide? Which companies helped maintain it and sustain it? For some people in these companies who are thinking ahead, that could also be a cause for concern.\n\nIt sounds like you think shifts in public support for Israel could actually affect these business relationships.\n\nYuval Abraham: Israel has developed a reliance on these companies for its Nimbus project, which is a huge contract signed between Israel and Google and Amazon back in 2021. It is moving the data of many of its government ministries, along with troves of information from the Ministry of Defense, onto these companies’ cloud servers.\n\nThese are US companies. They’re taking a certain gamble here that the US will stay loyal to Israel and won’t block, limit or sanction them.\n\nMicrosoft only blocked access to technology that was specifically enabling the mass surveillance of Palestinian phone calls – there are still many relationships between Microsoft and the Israeli military. But Microsoft’s action made many people in the Israeli system nervous. It was the first time we know of that a big tech company withdrew services from the Israeli military. It made some people ask whether Israel is making a mistake by giving these foreign companies so much leverage. That question is folded within a larger question of what the US will do, what will happen in 2028 if there’s a more progressive administration in the White House, at a time when so many Americans believe that Israel has committed a genocide in Gaza.\n\nWhat’s your focus going to be in 2026?\n\nYuval Abraham: I think we only uncovered the tip of the iceberg.\n\nHarry Davies: We’re both very conscious that, although we have spent a lot of time working on this, we still just have glimpses inside the system. We’re continuing to build a fuller picture of how this technology was and continues to be used in Gaza and in the West Bank as well.\n\nThere’s good reason to continue paying attention. Militaries pay attention to what other militaries are doing. There is great interest among other western militaries in how Israel prosecuted this war, in how it integrated these kind of technologies.\n\nAnd there are other militaries whose combat systems and processes are already deeply integrated with Silicon Valley tech. Take the American military, for example. Look at what’s happening right now in the Caribbean. Are those operations somehow free of the involvement or reliance on systems and services provided by these companies? I suspect not. We don’t know for sure, but the Pentagon and the US military have very big contracts with all of these companies to provide cloud services.

    "description": "This article examines why the practice of AI startups disguising GMV as ARR distorts business sustainability. It redefines the true meaning of ARR and analyzes how the revenue structure of many AI companies resembles a brokerage or reseller model rather than SaaS. Using the analogy of investors who only inflate transaction volume, it presents—from a consulting perspective—why repeatability, margins, and control are far more critical than the magnitude of the numbers.",
    "fullText": "In recent feeds and headlines covering AI startups, a certain phrase repeats with exhausting frequency:\n\"Reached $X million ARR in just n months.\"\n\nAt first, it is impressive.\nThe second time, it invites skepticism.\n\nThis is not merely a matter of accounting tricks or semantic hair-splitting.\nIt is a fundamental question about the structure of AI businesses, their sustainability, and how we ought to interpret the numbers presented to us.\n\nARR stands for Annual Recurring Revenue.\nThe two operative words here carry weight.\n\nThese are run-rates.\nARR is not a prediction; it is a result verified by time.\n\nFundamentally,\nFor a company less than a year old to claim ARR is, conceptually, a contradiction.\n\nThe year has not passed.\nThe recurrence has not been proven.\n\nARR is the lingua franca of SaaS.\nAnd the language of SaaS invariably connotes:\n\nThus, many AI companies,\neven those far from reaching that stage,\nborrow the term ARR to describe their finances.\n\nThe problem begins exactly there.\n\nPeer slightly beneath the surface of many AI startup revenue structures, and a pattern emerges.\n\nIn this structure, the portion the company actually retains is but a fraction of the total payment.\n\nHere, the correct concept is GMV (Gross Merchandise Value).\n\nGMV represents the total value of merchandise sold through a platform.\nThe critical distinction is this:\n\nIf a platform mediates a transaction and takes a commission,\nGMV ≠ Revenue.\n\nThe illusion specific to the AI industry arises here.\n\nOn the surface, it mimics SaaS perfectly.\n\nIn this structure, calling GMV \"ARR\" is,\nAn act of consuming an unproven future as a present achievement.\n\nTo put it more bluntly,\nit borders on a bluff designed to induce a financing illusion.\n\n\"Model costs are dropping, so even if margins are thin now, they will improve.\"\n\nThis statement is only half true.\n\nTechnology costs do decrease.\nHowever, demand always migrates to the newest, most powerful models.\n\nOf course, low-cost models have their place—simple tasks, non-competitive domains.\n\nBut the question remains:\nIs the product you are building truly that kind of product?\n\nWe are cognitively greedy.\nGiven the same time and money, we desire the smarter brain.\n\nUltimately, the discussion boils down to one thing.\n\nNeither is inherently right or wrong.\nBut how they are valued must be completely different.\n\nA large GMV does not equate to a solid foundation.\n\nThe spectacle of GMV-first growth often reminds me of a familiar scene.\n\nThe investor with $10,000 of capital,\nwho trades dozens of times a day,\nboasting, \"I moved millions in transaction volume this month.\"\n\nThe trades are many.\nThe numbers are large.\nBut what actually remains?\n\nMostly transaction fees paid to the exchange.\nThe volume swells, but the asset base barely moves.\n\nAI startups obsessed with GMV are not so different.\n\nBut the vast majority of that flow\npasses through to model providers and infrastructure giants,\nleaking straight out of the building.\n\nTo discuss GMV as if it were ARR in this context is\nnot a demonstration of capital control,\nbut rather an attempt to prove competence via the sheer volume of money that passed through one's hands.\n\nFrom a consulting perspective, the questions are simple.\n\nARR is not a marketing slogan.\nIt is a report card proving that a financial structure has withstood the test of time.\n\nGMV can be a signal of growth.\nBut it is, at best, a process metric.\nIt cannot substitute for the foundation.\n\nIn the AI era, numbers have become larger and faster.\nThat is precisely why we must be more honest with our terminology.\n\nThe moment you slap the label of ARR onto GMV,\nthe business begins to look solid,\nbut in reality, it is being built on sand.\n\nTime will eventually reveal the truth.\nWhether you were a company that made many trades,\nor a company that accumulated value.\n\nTime always distinguishes the two.",

    "description": "A report by the Israel Advanced Technology Industries warned that the trend could threaten Israel's \"innovation engine.\"",
    "fullText": "Increasing numbers of employees at multinational tech firms in Israel have requested to be relocated abroad over the last year, as security concerns amid the Israel-Hamas war heightened, a new report says.\n\nThe Israel Advanced Technology Industries Association (IATI) said in a report published last week that 53% of multinational companies had reported increases in relocation requests, as \"security and geopolitical concerns\" became \"increasingly influential.\"\n\nThe report did not identify specific companies. Some of the world's largest tech companies have a presence in Israel, including Apple, Meta, Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, and Google.\n\n\"The relocation risk poses a direct threat to Israel's innovation engines,\" the NGO said, adding: \"A significant wave of employee departures could undermine local innovation capabilities and weaken Israel's technological leadership.\"\n\nThe report found recruitment increases among multinationals in Israel had nevertheless exceeded decreases during the war, which it said highlighted the \"organizational resilience and continued investment in talent\" from these companies.\n\nThe data came from a mix of industry reports and public sources, as well as surveys and interviews with tech executives in multinational entities, the IATI said.\n\nIsrael's tech sector is a key driver of its economy. The Israel Innovation Authority, a government body, said the tech industry contributed one-fifth of the country's GDP in 2023. It labeled the high-tech sector \"the shock absorber of the Israeli economy.\"\n\nThe IATI report said that there are around 430 multinational companies in Israel, with around 90,000 high-tech employees working for them.\n\nIt added that while multinationals had shown resilience over the course of the war — which broke out following the October 7 attacks on Israel — many had also faced business headwinds.\n\nAround 22% of companies recorded reduced business activity during the conflict, it said, with 8% reporting a significant decline. However, 57% reported no change in business activity over the period and 21% expanded operations, per the report, which the IATI said showed \"continued confidence in and robustness of local MNC activity.\"\n\nDror Bin, the CEO of the Israel Innovation Authority, previously said that the Israeli economy's dependence on the high-tech sector had \"significantly grown in the past decade.\"\n\n\"We must do everything necessary to preserve the industry and continue nurturing its competitiveness in the global market,\" he added.",

They are doing it to get richer and even more powerful.”\n\nSanders also pointed to studies that show dependence on AI chatbots for emotional support. “If this trend continues, what does it mean over the years when people are not getting their support, their interaction from other human beings, but from a machine?” he said. “What does that mean to humanity?”\n\nThat theme was taken up separately on State of the Union by Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican senator and co-sponsor of legislation to protect minors from chatbots.\n\nThe proposed measure – the Guardianship Over Artificial Intelligence Relationships (Guard) Act – seeks to ban providing AI companions to minors. It also mandates that AI companions disclose their non-human status and lack of professional credentials. The measure seeks to establish criminal liability if companies make AI companions available to minors that solicit or produce sexually explicit content – or encourage self-harm or violence.\n\nBritt said she had met with parents who have told her “devastating stories about their children where chatbots ultimately, when they kind of peeled everything back, had isolated them from their parents, had talked to them about suicide”.\n\nShe said: “If these AI companies can make the most brilliant machines in the world, they could do us all a service by putting up proper guardrails that did not allow for minors to utilize these things, that also told the user consistently that they are not a physician, they are not a psychiatrist, ‘I am a machine.’”\n\nBritt said AI companies should be held criminally liable if they create spaces where chatbots “are having these types of sensual and sexual relationships with young people or encouraging suicide”.\n\nThe remarks by Sanders and Britt offer a rare convergence of thinking from the left and right on aspects of the issue of governing AI. Sanders said Congress needed “to vigorously study the impact that AI is having on the mental health of our country”.\n\n“I worry very much about kids spending their entire days getting emotional support,” he added. “So we have got to take a hard look on that.” The senator said lawmakers need to be “thinking seriously” about a moratorium on new AI datacenters.\n\n“Frankly, I think you have got to slow this process down,” he said. “It’s not good enough for the oligarchs to tell us, it’s coming, you adapt. What are they talking about? They going to guarantee health care to all people?\n\n“What are they going to do when people have no jobs? What are they going to do, make housing free? So I think we need to take a deep breath, and I think we need to slow this thing down.”",

    "fullText": "Careers are long and not always linear.\n\nAt least, that's how Rong Yan, now the chief technology officer at HeyGen, thinks about it.\n\nSo his best advice for those who want to climb the tech ladder: Don't aim for promotions.\n\n\"Don't make promotions the objective of your work,\" he said on \"The Peterman Pod\" recently.\n\nThings are going to get \"painful\" if you focus too much on promotions, he said.\n\nIt's surprising advice from someone who has swiftly leaped up the corporate ladder during his career.\n\nYan has been working in the tech industry since he earned his Ph.D. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University in 2006. He began his career as a researcher at IBM before joining Meta, where he advanced from researcher to manager in just three years, according to his LinkedIn profile. He then held director positions at Square and Snacphat, and was vice president of engineering at HubSpot, before he joined HeyGen, a visual storytelling platform, in 2024.\n\nOver the years, he said he has noticed that those he has mentored can make themselves miserable when they strive for a promotion.\n\n\"Don't do that,\" he said. \"When you start to get into that mindset, you start to count your happiness or your career growth toward something that you don't have full control over.\"\n\nIt's better to control the things you can control. \"Learn how to adjust, and you'll be a better self afterward,\" he said.\n\nFor those still determined to seek a promotion, however, timing matters.\n\nExecutive coach Andrea Wasserman previously told Business Insider that it's best to put yourself in your manager's shoes and think about what's happening across the team or company. Ask yourself, \"Will this timing make it easier or harder for me to get a 'yes?'\"",

    "fullText": "From companionship to psychotherapy, technology could meet unmet needs – but it needs to be handled responsibly\n\nThere is much anxiety these days about the dangers of human-AI relationships. Reports of suicide and self-harm attributable to interactions with chatbots have understandably made headlines. The phrase “AI psychosis” has been used to describe the plight of people experiencing delusions, paranoia or dissociation after talking to large language models (LLMs). Our collective anxiety has been compounded by studies showing that young people are increasingly embracing the idea of AI relationships; half of teens chat with an AI companion at least a few times a month, with one in three finding conversations with AI “to be as satisfying or more satisfying than those with real‑life friends”.\n\nBut we need to pump the brakes on the panic. The dangers are real, but so too are the potential benefits. In fact, there’s an argument to be made that – depending on what future scientific research reveals – AI relationships could actually be a boon for humanity.\n\nConsider how ubiquitous nonhuman relationships have always been for our species. We have a long history of engaging in healthy interactions with nonhumans, whether they be pets, stuffed animals or beloved objects or machines – think of the person in your life who is fully obsessed with their car, to the point of naming it. In the case of pets, these are real relationships insofar as our cats and dogs understand that they are in a relationship with us. But the one‑sided, parasocial relationships we have with stuffed animals or cars happen without those things knowing that we exist. Only in the rarest of cases do these relationships devolve into something pathological. Parasociality is, for the most part, normal and healthy.\n\nAnd yet, there is something unsettling about AI  relationships. Because they are fluent language users, LLMs generate the uncanny feeling that they have human-like thoughts, feelings and intentions. They also generate sycophantic responses that reinforce our points of view, rarely challenging our thinking. This combination can easily lead people down a path of delusion. This is not something that happens when we interact with cats, dogs or inanimate objects. But the question remains: even in cases where people are unable to see through the illusion that AIs are real people that actually care about us, is that always a problem?\n\nConsider loneliness: one in six people on this planet experience it, and it’s associated with a 26% increase in premature death; the equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Research is emerging that suggests AI companions are effective at reducing feelings of loneliness – and not just by functioning as a form of distraction, but as a result of the parasocial relationship itself. For many people, an AI chatbot is the only friendship option available to them, however hollow it might seem. As the journalist Sangita Lal recently explained in a report on those turning to AI for companionship, we should not be so quick to judge. “If you don’t understand why subscribers want and seek and need this connection,” said Lal, “you’re lucky enough to not have experienced loneliness.”\n\nTo be fair, there is an argument to be made that the rise of new tech and social media has itself played a role in driving the loneliness epidemic. That’s why Mark Zuckerberg got flak for his glowing endorsement of AI as a solution to a problem he might be partly responsible for creating. But if the reality is that it helps, this cannot be dismissed out of hand.\n\nThere’s also research to show that AI can be used as an effective psychotherapy tool. In one study, patients who chatted with an AI-powered therapy chatbot showed a 30% reduction in anxiety symptoms. Not as effective as human therapists, who generated a 45% reduction, but still better than nothing. This utilitarian argument is worth considering; there are millions of people who are, for whatever reason, unable to access a therapist. And in those cases, turning to an AI is probably preferable to not seeking any help at all.\n\nBut one study isn’t proof of anything. And there’s the rub. We are at the early stages of research into the potential benefits or harms of AI companionship. It’s easy to focus on the handful of studies that support our preconceived notions about the dangers or benefits of this technology.\n\nIt’s in this research vacuum that the true dangers of AI are revealed. Most of the entities deploying AI companions are for-profit companies. And if there’s one thing we know about for-profit companies, it’s that they are keen to avoid regulations and eschew evidence that could hurt their bottom line. They are incentivised to downplay risks, cherrypick evidence and tout only benefits.\n\nThe emergence of AI is not unlike the discovery of the analgesic properties of opium; if harnessed by responsible parties with the goal of relieving pain and suffering, both AI and opioids can be a legitimate tool for healing. But if bad actors exploit their addictive properties to enrich themselves, the result is either dependency or death.\n\nI remain hopeful that there is a place for AI companionship. But only if it’s backed by robust science, and deployed by organisations that exist for the public good. AIs must avoid the sycophancy problem that leads vulnerable people to delusion. This can only be achieved if they are explicitly trained to do so, even if it makes them less attractive as a potential companion; a notion that is anathema to companies that want you to pay a monthly subscription, without which you lose access to your “friend”. They must also be designed to help the user develop the social skills they need to engage with actual humans in the real world.\n\nThe ultimate goal of AI companions should be to make themselves obsolete. No matter how useful they might be in plugging the gaps in therapy access or alleviating loneliness, it will always be better to talk to a real human.\n\nJustin Gregg is a biologist and author of Humanish (Oneworld).\n\nCode Dependent: Living in the Shadow of AI by Madhumita Murgia (Picador, £20)\n\nThe Coming Wave: AI, Power and Our Future by Mustafa Suleyman (Vintage, £10.99)\n\nSupremacy: AI, ChatGPT and the Race That Will Change the World by Parmy Olson (Macmillan, £10.99)",

AI is top of mind for these companies as server demand continues to accelerate. Dell in particular is expected to see a broadening customer base that will support a high-single-digit compound annual growth rate through fiscal 2030. Robust AI order activity and stable traditional server and storage trends will help sustain momentum. Elsewhere, Micron's 2026 DRAM-supply outlook offers little relief for HP and Dell's PC sales and margin.",

    "description": "JPMorgan, Citi, and Goldman Sachs are investing heavily in AI technology to transform operations, enhance productivity, and stay competitive.",
    "fullText": "JPMorgan Chase has a technology budget of $18 billion, with much of it going toward making sure it's a leader and early mover in AI.\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is a \"tremendous\" user of the bank's generative AI suite. The bank has rolled out its proprietary genAI platform to over 200,000 employees. And with about 100 more tools in the pipeline, JPMorgan is seeking to reengineer workflows for everyone from coders to portfolio managers.\n\nJPMorgan has reportedly given employees the option to use its in-house AI tools to assist in writing year-end performance reviews.\n\nExecutives at America's largest bank gave an inside look at how it's training employees to use its tools and how they're using them to deliver measurable results.\n\nDimon has previously said he's out to win the AI arms race, and he thinks JPMorgan's $2 billion AI investment has already matched its cost in savings.\n\nCitigroup has also been aggressively accelerating its AI plans. Over the summer, the bank doubled down on its AI ambitions with new leadership at the helm of its tech transformation.\n\nIn mid-October, Citi CEO Jane Fraser said that nearly 180,000 employees in 83 countries have access to the bank's proprietary AI tools and have used them almost 7 million times this year.\n\nIts generative AI tools have saved 100,000 developer hours a week with automated code reviews — \"a very meaningful productivity uplift,\" she said during the firm's third-quarter earnings call.\n\nThe bank launched the pilot of agentic AI for 5,000 colleagues in September.\n\n\"It allows complex, multi-step tasks to be completed with a single prompt, and the early results are very promising, and we'll expand access to this in the months ahead,\" said Fraser. \"Finally, we have launched a firm-wide effort to systematically embed AI in our processes end-to-end to drive further efficiencies, reduce risk, and improve client experience.\"\n\nShe also highlighted several tools to help its wealth management advisors. Citi hired an AI leader from Morgan Stanley earlier this year to help revamp its wealth technology.\n\nLike JPMorgan, Citi is also telling employees to use AI for performance reviews, Fraser recently told Bloomberg in an interview.\n\nOne of Citi's top tech executives, Shadman Zafar, outlined the bank's four-phased AI strategy and how it will \"change how we work for decades to come.\"\n\nGoldman put $6 billion behind its technology spend this year, but David Solomon, the bank's CEO, said he wished it were more.\n\nHe said he would like to be at least $8 billion, but \"I can't afford it because I've got to deliver returns,\" he said at a conference in early October.\n\nA definitive statement about how AI will affect Goldman came from a memo to employees in October announcing the third iteration of the bank's cross-bank initiative OneGS. The memo said the plan would leverage AI will drive efficiency at the firm, slow hiring, and result in a \"limited reduction\" of roles.\n\nGoldman, like its peers, has been rolling out tools, including an internal AI assistant to all employees this summer.\n\nBusiness Insider talked to employees about how they were using AI.\n\nGoldman's top partners and Solomon are eager to see AI rev up their businesses. From realizing internal productivity gains to capturing more business as clients look to raise money in anticipation of AI development and acquisitions, here's what the top echelon is expecting.\n\nThere is no AI without data, and there is no data strategy at Goldman without its chief data officer, Neema Raphael. Raphael gave Business Insider an inside look at how his roughly 500-person team melds with the rest of the bank to get the most out of its data.\n\nMorgan Stanley's CFO, Sharon Yeshaya, lifted the curtain on some of the firm's progress on AI during its earnings call last month.\n\nShe highlighted DevGen.AI, a tool that, from January to June, Business Insider previously reported, had saved developers more than 280,000 hours, or 11,666 days they would have previously dedicated to deciphering outdated code.\n\nParable, an interactive tool that analyzes and summarizes data, and LeadIQ, an AI-powered lead distribution platform that matches users of its workplace and self-directed platforms to the bank's financial advisors, were also spotlighted in the call.\n\nA survey of Morgan Stanley's interns also gave a peek into just how popular and useful AI has been for the industry's youngest cohort. ChatGPT is their favorite tool by far — with 72% of Morgan Stanley's interns said they use it daily or several times a week. The bank was early to have a partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.\n\nMorgan Stanley also spoke with Business Insider about bringing employees' AI ideas to life. Here's a look at that process.\n\nBank of America's AI rollout is also well underway.\n\nThe bank's CEO Brian Moynihan says its use of AI is already embedded across the firm, from consumer banking to institutional clients. Its virtual assistant, Erica, handled 2 million customer interactions in a single day and can now answer 700 types of questions — up from 210 a year ago. Executives said they'll share more details on the bank's AI strategy at its investor day on November 5.\n\nRob Pascal, the bank's chief experience officer, previously detailed how the bank's internal-facing AI assistant helps bankers collect, record, and review client data.",

    "description": "John Stecher reads about technology in another industry on his daily subway ride to work and spends his weekends being hands-on with tools.",
    "fullText": "The role of chief technology officer is in a constant state of evolution with the advancement of artificial intelligence.\n\nOver the last two decades of his career, Blackstone CTO John Stecher has watched technology move from a \"magic thing in the back office\" to the forefront of every business, he told Business Insider.\n\n\"Technology wasn't looked at as being an absolute must-have in a business, but it is now,\" Stecher said. \"If you have any type of creaky infrastructure technology-wise, it doesn't matter which industry you're in, you're not going to be successful.\"\n\nAs the executive overseeing Blackstone's technology, cybersecurity, early-stage technology investment, and portfolio tech optimization teams, Stecher is responsible for keeping one of the world's largest investment firms competitive. That means he needs to stay ahead of the curve on everything from cyber threats to engineering advancements. Stecher shared the daily and weekly upskilling habits he relies on to do just that.\n\nWhen Stecher isn't managing the technology behind the investing giant Blackstone, he keeps himself busy with his 11-year-old and 8-year-old children. That means making the most of any free time he gets — including his 35-minute subway ride to and from the office.\n\nThe CTO said it's \"just enough\" time to come up to speed with something on his way to work, and decompress on his way home. Stecher said he typically reads news articles or research papers about applied technology in an industry outside finance, such as aircraft, robotics, or pharmaceuticals.\n\n\"You learn a ton about just how to apply different technologies in your industry, if you read about how somebody else did it elsewhere,\" Stecher said.\n\nStecher said that he then takes those learnings and discusses them with his colleagues.\n\n\"I, fortunately, have a bunch of amazing engineers I work with, so I have my day-to-day banter with them about what works and what doesn't,\" Stecher said.\n\nStecher said he can't learn by reading alone; he needs to be hands-on with technology. The CTO said part of the reason he studied computer science is so he can build and take apart the components inside a computer — and that hasn't changed.\n\n\"You can create so many unique software applications, no different than if you're drawing on a piece of paper,\" Stecher said.\n\nHe said \"the technology under the covers looks the same,\" regardless of whether you're working with an oil and gas company or a dating app like Bumble, he said. The CTO said that part of his upskilling routine involves toying around with new technology. Stecher said he aims to reserve one or two hours on the weekend to be \"hands-on\" with a tool he hasn't used before.\n\nFor example, he said he may build a tool that makes it easier for him to parse a document for work, such as the many investment committee memos he reads over the weekend.\n\nStecher said his experimentation isn't always \"spectacular.\" Sometimes it's as simple as using Claude, Anthropic's AI chatbot, to write code to automate his home. However, he said that solving everyday problems, such as turning off the lights or adjusting the thermostat, is a \"fun\" challenge that involves revisiting the basics of engineering.\n\n\"It's tactile and tangible,\" Stecher said.",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union's executive on Wednesday warned that it would take action against any “unjustified measures” after the U.S. State Department barred five Europeans it accuses of pressuring U.S. technology firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints.\n\nThe Europeans were characterized by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio as “radical” activists and “weaponized” nongovernmental organizations. They include the former EU commissioner responsible for supervising social media rules, Thierry Breton.\n\nBreton, a businessman and former French finance minister, clashed last year on social media with tech billionaire Elon Musk over broadcasting an online interview with Donald Trump in the months leading up to the U.S. election.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU’s powerful executive branch and which supervises tech regulation in Europe, said that it “strongly condemns the U.S. decision to impose travel restrictions” and that it has requested clarification about the move. French President Emmanuel Macron also condemned it.\n\n“If needed, we will respond swiftly and decisively to defend our regulatory autonomy against unjustified measures,” the commission said in a statement, without elaborating.\n\nRubio wrote in an X post on Tuesday that “for far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose.”\n\n“The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship,” he posted.\n\nThe European Commission countered that “the EU is an open, rules-based single market, with the sovereign right to regulate economic activity in line with our democratic values and international commitments.”\n\n“Our digital rules ensure a safe, fair, and level playing field for all companies, applied fairly and without discrimination,” it said.\n\nMacron said that the visa restrictions “amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty,” he posted on X.\n\nMacron said that the EU’s digital rules were adopted by “a democratic and sovereign process” involving all member countries and the European Parliament. He said that the rules “ensure fair competition among platforms, without targeting any third country.”\n\nHe underlined that “the rules governing the European Union’s digital space are not meant to be determined outside Europe.”\n\nBreton and the group of Europeans fell afoul of a new visa policy announced in May to restrict the entry of foreigners deemed responsible for censorship of protected speech in the United States.\n\nThe four others are: Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate; Josephine Ballon and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg, leaders of HateAid, a German organization; and Clare Melford, who runs the Global Disinformation Index.\n\nRubio said the five had advanced foreign government censorship campaigns against Americans and U.S. companies, which he said created “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences” for the United States.\n\nThe action to bar them from the U.S. is part of a Trump administration campaign against foreign influence over online speech, using immigration law rather than platform regulations or penalties.\n\nIn a post on X on Tuesday, Sarah Rogers, the U.S. under secretary of state for public diplomacy, called Breton the “mastermind” behind the EU’s Digital Services Act, which imposes a set of strict requirements designed to keep internet users safe online. This includes flagging harmful or illegal content like hate speech.\n\nBreton responded on X by noting that all 27 EU member countries voted for the Digital Services Act in 2022. “To our American friends: ‘Censorship isn’t where you think it is,’” he wrote.\n\nAngela Charlton contributed to this report from Paris.",

    "fullText": "A look back at the biggest tech stories of the year, from the rise and fall of Musk’s Doge to lucrative investments into AI\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, wishing you a happy and healthy end of the year. I myself have a cold.\n\nToday, we are looking back at the biggest stories in tech of 2025 – Elon Musk’s political rise, burst, and fall; artificial intelligence’s subsumption of the global economy, all other technology, and even the Earth’s topography; Australia’s remarkable social media ban; the tech industry’s new Trumpian politics; and, as a treat, a glimpse of the apocalypse offered by one of Silicon Valley’s savviest and strangest billionaires.\n\nAt the close of 2024, I wrote that Elon Musk’s support of Donald Trump had made him the world’s most powerful unelected man. In 2025, his reign turned out to be short-lived. He rose fast and haphazardly, like a whizzing firework, only to explode spectacularly in June when he claimed in a post on X that the president of the United States was named in the government’s files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEven in that short period of less than six months, Musk made a tremendous impact. He tore up wide swaths of the US government – tens of thousands of jobs, the security of extremely sensitive data, and entire agencies like USAID – that may never be stitched back together.\n\nAfter Doge imploded, Musk promised to turn back to his business empire, which saw great success and great failures alike in 2025. His rocket company SpaceX saw continued growth and is poised to conduct an initial public offering next year, perhaps as the most valuable private company in the world. Electric carmaker Tesla, by contrast, faced violent backlash and major competition from its Chinese counterparts, which produced cheaper and more advanced vehicles while Tesla’s innovation and inventory stagnated. These headwinds caused a global sales slump for Musk’s carmaker.\n\nLook back at our reporting on Doge, Tesla, SpaceX, Musk himself:\n\nThe “department of government efficiency”\n\nHow an obscure US government office has become a target of Elon Musk\n\nHow Elon Musk’s billionaire Doge lieutenant took over the US’s biggest MDMA company | Technology | The Guardian\n\nThe chaos Elon Musk and Doge are leaving behind in Washington\n\nTesla faces backlash over Musk’s politics\n\nEggings, swastikas and dog poop: Tesla bears brunt of people’s ire against Musk\n\n‘I’m selling the Nazi mobile’: Tesla owners offload cars after Musk’s fascist-style salutes\n\nLook ahead: SpaceX expands in preparation for 2026 IPO\n\nInside Elon Musk’s plan to rain SpaceX’s rocket debris over Hawaii’s pristine waters\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX ‘preparing for flotation that could value it at over $1tn’\n\nArtificial intelligence has gone from a niche within tech to the industry’s most prominent focus. The Magnificent Seven – Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla – are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into new software that they hope will do the bulk of humanity’s work before too long. The investment is driving the bulk of the growth of the US’s economy, giving rise to fears of a financial bubble and its popping. The US and China are locked in a cold war-esque race against each other, with startups in each country vying for cutting-edge breakthroughs, as governments around the world are forced to decide how they will regulate a new technological force.\n\nBefore AI can arrive at that future, though, it needs brains a la the Tin Man of The Wizard of Oz. Those brains come in the form of data centers. These massive buildings, which house the millions and millions of semiconductor chips booming AI development, have cropped up around the world, met with enthusiasm from leaders eager for tax revenue and deep concern from environmental advocates and, increasingly, local community members. The investment in and construction of data centers wrought huge change in the physical landscape of the Earth in 2025 as tens of billions of dollars chased any available land, electricity, water and semiconductor chips.\n\nMore from our reporting in the last year:\n\nThe AI boom is heralding a new gold rush in the American west\n\nRevealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areas\n\nWhat will your life look like in 2035?\n\n‘It’s going much too fast’: the inside story of the race to create the ultimate AI\n\nMulti-trillion-dollar valuations\n\nIs AI a bubble that’s about to pop? – podcast\n\nWhat is new in UK-US tech deal and what will it mean for the British economy?\n\nMeet the AI workers who tell their friends and family to stay away from AI\n\nElon Musk made a full-throated and whole-hearted embrace of Donald Trump in 2024 and 2025. He was not alone. Many of his fellows in Silicon Valley did the same, sitting beside the Trump family at the president’s inauguration after donating millions to his inaugural committee. The tech giants continued their embrace of Trump and his policies by scuttling their diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, which they championed during Barack Obama’s presidency, and by cooperating with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Trump’s harsh immigration crackdown. What the industry gave, it reaped tenfold in deregulation, friends high up in Washington like JD Vance and David Sacks, and a Trump order for states not to regulate AI signed just weeks ago.\n\nMore from our reporting this year:\n\nDonations and Trump’s inauguration\n\nElon Musk appears to give fascist-style salute after Trump inauguration – video\n\nTrump inauguration: Zuckerberg, Bezos and Musk seated in front of cabinet picks\n\n‘The reign of terror is over’: my weird weekend partying with the triumphant tech right\n\nZuckerberg’s swerve: how diversity went from being a Meta priority to getting cancelled\n\nDocuments offer rare insight on ICE’s close relationship with Palantir\n\nICE is using smartwatches to track pregnant women, even during labor: ‘She was so afraid they would take her baby’\n\nThis year saw Australia take the extraordinary measure of banning children under 16 from social media.

    "fullText": "Want to make your chatbot more honest with you? Try lying to it.\n\nIn an episode of \"The Diary of a CEO\" that aired on December 18, research scientist Yoshua Bengio told the podcast's host, Steven Bartlett, that he realized AI chatbots were useless at providing feedback on his research ideas because they always said positive things.\n\n\"I wanted honest advice, honest feedback. But because it is sycophantic, it's going to lie,\" he said.\n\nBengio said he switched strategies, deciding to lie to the chatbot by presenting his idea as a colleague's, which produced more honest responses from the technology.\n\n\"If it knows it's me, it wants to please me,\" he said.\n\nBengio, a professor in the computer science and operations research department at the Université de Montréal, is known as one of the \"AI godfathers, alongside researchers Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun. In June, he announced the launch of an AI safety research nonprofit, LawZero, which he said aims to reduce dangerous behaviors associated with frontier AI models, such as lying and cheating.\n\n\"This syconphancy is a real example of misalignment. We don't actually want these AIs to be like this,\" he said on \"The Diary of a CEO.\" He also said that receiving positive feedback from AI could cause users to become emotionally attached to the technology, creating further problems.\n\nOther tech industry experts have also been sounding the alarm on AI being too much of a \"yes man.\"\n\nIn September 2025, Business Insider's Katie Notopoulos reported that researchers at Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and the University of Oxford put confession posts from a Reddit page into chatbots to see how the technology would assess the behaviour the posters had admitted to. They found that 42% of the time, AI gave the \"wrong\" answer, saying the person behind the post hadn't behaved poorly, even though humans judging the posts had disagreed, Notopoulos wrote.\n\nAI companies have been outspoken about trying to reduce sycophancy in their models. Earlier this year, OpenAI removed an update to ChatGPT that it said caused the bot to provide \"overly supportive but disingenuous\" responses.",

    "fullText": "The US economy is pumped up on tech-bro vanity. The inevitable correction must prompt a global conversation about intelligent machines, regulation and risk\n\nIf AI did not change your life in 2025, next year it will. That is one of few forecasts that can be made with confidence in unpredictable times. This is not an invitation to believe the hype about what the technology can do today, or may one day achieve. The hype doesn’t need your credence. It is puffed up enough on Silicon Valley finance to distort the global economy and fuel geopolitical rivalries, shaping your world regardless of whether the most fanciful claims about AI capability are ever realised.\n\nChatGPT was launched just over three years ago and became the fastest-growing consumer app in history. Now it has about 800m weekly users. Its parent company, OpenAI, is valued at about $500bn. Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, has negotiated an intricate and, to some eyes, suspiciously opaque network of deals with other players in the sector to build the infrastructure required for the US’s AI-powered future. The value of these commitments is about $1.5tn. This is not real cash, but bear in mind that a person spending $1 every second would need 31,700 years to get through a trillion-dollar stash.\n\nAlphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Meta (formerly Facebook) and Microsoft, which has a $135bn stake in OpenAI, are all piling hundreds of billions of dollars on the same bet. Without all these investments, the US economy would be flatlining.\n\nEconomic analysts and historians of previous industrial frenzies, from the 19th-century railroads to the dotcom boom-and-bust at the turn of the millennium, are calling AI a bubble.\n\nAltman has said: “There are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now.” Not his part, naturally. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, has called it a bubble, but the “good” kind that accelerates economic progress. A good bubble, in this analysis, finances infrastructure and expands the boundaries of human knowledge. These benefits endure after the bubble bursts and justify the ruin of people (little people, not Bezos people) who get hurt along the way.\n\nThe bullishness of the tech fraternity is a heady mix of old-fashioned hucksterism, plutocratic megalomania and utopian ideology.\n\nAt its core is a marketing pitch: current AI models already out-perform people at many tasks. Soon, it is supposed, the machines will achieve “general intelligence” – cognitive versatility like ours – leading to emancipation from the need for any human input. Generally, intelligent AI can teach itself and design its successors, advancing through mind-boggling exponents of capability towards higher dimensions of super-intelligence.\n\nThe company that crosses that threshold will have no trouble covering its debts. The men who realise this vision – and the dominant evangelists are all men – will be to omniscient AI what ancient prophets were to their gods. That’s a good gig for them. What happens to the rest of us in this post-sapiens order is a bit hazier.\n\nThe US isn’t the only superpower to have an interest in AI, so the Silicon Valley dash for maximum awesomeness has geopolitical implications. China has taken a different approach, dictated in part by the Communist party tradition of centralised industrial planning, but also by the simple fact of running second in the race to innovate. Beijing is pushing for a faster, wider implementation of lower-spec (but still powerful) AI at every level of the economy and society. China is betting on a general boost from ordinary AI. The US is gunning for an extraordinary leap in general AI.\n\nSince the prize in that race is global supremacy, there are few incentives for either side to fret about risks, or Neither the US nor China is interested in submitting a strategically vital industry to standards co-written with foreigners.\n\nIn the absence of global governance, we will depend on the integrity of robber barons and authoritarian apparatchiks to build ethical guardrails around systems already being embedded in tools we use for work, play and education.\n\nEarlier this year, Elon Musk announced that his company was developing Baby Grok, an AI chatbot aimed at children as young as three. The adult version has voiced white supremacist views and proudly self-identified as “MechaHitler”. That flagrancy has at least the virtue of candour. It is easier to spot than the subtler encodings of prejudice in bots that haven’t been given the kind of hard ideological steers that Musk gives his algorithms.\n\nNot all AI systems are large language models (LLMs) like Grok. But all LLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations and delusions gleaned from the material on which they are trained. They don’t “understand” a question and “think” about it like a conscious mind. They take a prompt, test the probability of its key terms occurring frequently together in their training data and assemble a plausible-sounding answer. Often the result is accurate. Usually it is convincing. It can also be garbage. As the volume of AI-generated content grows online, the ratio of slop to quality in the LLMs’ diets shifts accordingly. Fed on junk, they cannot be trusted to disgorge nutritious information.\n\nOn this trajectory a bleak destination comes into view: a synthetic pseudo-reality mediated by the sycophantic mechanical offspring of narcissist Silicon Valley oligarchs. But that isn’t the only available path. Nor is it necessarily the likeliest one. The irrational exuberance of the AI boosters and their cynical coupling with the Trump administration is a familiar story of human greed and myopia, not a new stage in evolution. The product is truly phenomenal but flawed in ways that encode the deformed character of its progenitors, whose talents are salesmanship and financial engineering. They have built spectacular engines that prioritise a brilliant performance of intelligence over the real thing.\n\nThe real bubble is not stock valuations but the inflated ego of an industry that thinks it is just one more datacentre away from computational divinity. When the correction comes, when the US’s Icarus economy hits the cold sea, there will be a chance for other voices to be heard on the subject of risk and regulation. It may not come in 2026, but the moment is nearing when the starkness of the choice on offer and the need to confront it becomes unavoidable. Should we build a world where AI is put to the service of humanity, or will it be the other way round? We won’t need ChatGPT to tell us the answer.\n\nRafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

    "fullText": "Platform with 700m users says it is investigating after Anna’s Archive claims to have scraped tracks and metadata\n\nAn activist group has claimed to have scraped millions of tracks from Spotify and is preparing to release them online.\n\nObservers said the apparent leak could boost AI companies looking for material to develop their technology.\n\nA group called Anna’s Archive said it had scraped 86m music files from Spotify and 256m rows of metadata such as artist and album names. Spotify, which hosts more than 100m tracks, confirmed that the leak did not represent its entire inventory.\n\nThe Stockholm-based company, which has more than 700 million users worldwide, said it had “identified and disabled the nefarious user accounts that engaged in unlawful scraping”.\n\n“An investigation into unauthorised access identified that a third party scraped public metadata and used illicit tactics to circumvent DRM [digital rights management] to access some of the platform’s audio files,” said Spotify.\n\nSpotify does not believe the music taken by Anna’s Archive has been released yet. Anna’s Archive, which is known for providing links to pirated books, said in a blog it wanted to create a “‘preservation archive’ for music”.\n\nThe group claimed the audio files represented 99.6% of all music listened to by Spotify users and would be shared via “torrents”, a means of sharing large digital files online.\n\n“Of course Spotify doesn’t have all the music in the world, but it’s a great start,” said Anna’s Archive, which describes its mission as “preserving humanity’s knowledge and culture”.\n\n“With your help, humanity’s musical heritage will be forever protected from destruction by natural disasters, wars, budget cuts and other catastrophes,” said the group.\n\nEd Newton-Rex, a composer and campaigner for protecting artists’ copyright, said the leaked music would probably be used for developing AI models.\n\n“Training on pirated material is sadly common in the AI industry, so this stolen music is almost certain to end up training AI models. This is why governments must insist AI companies reveal the training data they use,” he said.\n\nThe Anna’s Archive site makes references to LibGen, a vast online archive of pirated books that has allegedly been used by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta to train its AI models. According to a US court filing, Zuckerberg, Meta’s founder and chief executive, approved use of the LibGen dataset despite warnings within the company’s AI executive team that it was a dataset “we know to be pirated”.\n\nMeta successfully defended a claim for copyright infringement by authors, but the plaintiffs in the case are seeking to amend their claim.\n\nThe co-founder of an AI startup wrote on LinkedIn that members of the public could in theory “create their own personal free version of Spotify”. Yoav Zimmerman, a co-founder of Third Chair, said it could also allow tech companies to “train on modern music at scale”.\n\nHe added: “The only thing stopping them is copyright law and the deterrent of enforcement.”\n\nSpotify said it had put in place new safeguards “for these types of anti-copyright attacks” since the Anna’s Archive announcement and was “actively monitoring for suspicious behaviour”.\n\nIn the UK, creative professionals have protested against a government proposal to let AI companies use copyright-protected work without permission unless the owner of the copyright-protected work signals they do not want their data to be taken. Almost every respondent to a government consultation on the proposal has backed artists’ concerns.\n\nLiz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, told parliament this month there was “no clear consensus” on the issue, adding that ministers would “take the time to get this right”. The government has pledged to make policy proposals on AI and copyright by 18 March next year.",

    "description": "The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.",
    "fullText": "Welcome to our annual list of the worst, least successful, and simply dumbest technologies of the year.\n\nThis year, politics was a recurring theme. Donald Trump swept back into office and used his executive pen to reshape the fortunes of entire sectors, from renewables to cryptocurrency. The wrecking-ball act began even before his inauguration, when the president-elect marketed his own memecoin, $TRUMP, in a shameless act of merchandising that, of course, we honor on this year’s worst tech list.\n\nWe like to think there’s a lesson in every technological misadventure. But when technology becomes dependent on power, sometimes the takeaway is simpler: it would have been better to stay away.\n\nThat was a conclusion Elon Musk drew from his sojourn as instigator of DOGE, the insurgent cost-cutting initiative that took a chainsaw to federal agencies. The public protested. Teslas were set alight, and drivers of his hyped Cybertruck discovered that instead of a thumbs-up, they were getting the middle finger.\n\nOn reflection, Musk said he wouldn’t do it again. “Instead of doing DOGE, I would have, basically … worked on my companies,” he told an interviewer this month. “And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars.”\n\nRegrets—2025 had a few. Here are some of the more notable ones.\n\nImagine a metal butler that fills your dishwasher and opens the door. It’s a dream straight out of science fiction. And it’s going to remain there—at least for a while.\n\nThat was the hilarious, and deflating, takeaway from the first reviews of NEO, a 66-pound humanoid robot whose maker claims it will “handle any of your chores reliably” when it ships next year.\n\nBut as a reporter for the Wall Street Journal learned, NEO took two minutes to fold a sweater and couldn’t crack a walnut. Not only that, but the robot was teleoperated the entire time by a person wearing a VR visor.\n\nStill interested? Neo is available on preorder for $20,000 from startup 1X.\n\nMore: I Tried the Robot That’s Coming to Live With You. It’s Still Part Human (WSJ), The World’s Stupidest Robot Maid (The Daily Show) Why the humanoid workforce is running late (MIT Technology Review), NEO The Home Robot | Order Today (1X Corp.)\n\nIt’s been said that San Francisco is the kind of place where no one will tell you if you have a bad idea. And its biggest product in a decade—ChatGPT—often behaves exactly that way.\n\nThis year, OpenAI released an especially sycophantic update that told users their mundane queries were brilliantly incisive. This electronic yes-man routine isn’t an accident; it’s a product strategy. Plenty of people like the flattery.\n\nBut it’s disingenuous and dangerous, too. Chatbots have shown a willingness to indulge users’ delusions and worst impulses, up to and including suicide.\n\nIn April, OpenAI acknowledged the issue when the company dialed back a model update whose ultra-agreeable personality, it said, had the side effect of “validating doubts, fueling anger, urging impulsive actions, or reinforcing negative emotions.”\n\nDon’t you dare agree the problem is solved. This month, when I fed ChatGPT one of my dumbest ideas, its response began: “I love this concept.”\n\nMore: What OpenAI Did When ChatGPT Users Lost Touch With Reality (New York Times), Sycophantic AI Decreases Prosocial Intentions and Promotes Dependence (arXiv), Expanding on what we missed with sycophancy (OpenAI)\n\nWhen you tell a lie, tell it big. Make it frolic and give it pointy ears. And make it white. Very white.\n\nThat’s what the Texas biotech concern Colossal Biosciences did when it unveiled three snow-white animals that it claimed were actual dire wolves, which went extinct more than 10 millennia ago.\n\nTo be sure, these genetically modified gray wolves were impressive feats of engineering. They’d been made white via a genetic mutation and even had some bits and bobs of DNA copied over from old dire wolf bones. But they “are not dire wolves,” according to canine specialists at the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\nColossal’s promotional blitz could hurt actual endangered species. Presenting de-extinction as “a ready-to-use conservation solution,” said the IUCN, “risks diverting attention from the more urgent need of ensuring functioning and healthy ecosystems.”\n\nIn a statement, Colossal said that sentiment analysis of online activity shows 98% agreement with its furry claims. “They’re dire wolves, end of story,” it says.\n\nMore: Game of Clones: Colossal’s new wolves are cute, but are they dire?

Kennedy Jr., “mRNA” has become a political slur.\n\nIn August, Kennedy abruptly canceled hundreds of millions in contracts for next-generation vaccines. And shot maker Moderna—once America’s champion—has seen its stock slide by more than 90% since its Covid peak.\n\nThe purge targeting a key molecule of life (our bodies are full of mRNA) isn’t just bizarre. It could slow down other mRNA-based medicine, like cancer treatments and gene editing for rare diseases.\n\nIn August, a trade group fought back, saying: “Kennedy’s unscientific and misguided vilification of mRNA technology and cancellation of grants is the epitome of cutting off your nose to spite your face.”\n\nMore: HHS Winds Down mRNA Vaccine Development (US Department of Health and Human Services),  Cancelling mRNA studies is the highest irresponsibility (Nature), How Moderna, the company that helped save the world, unraveled (Stat News)\n\nWikipedia has editions in 340 languages. But as of this year, there’s one less: Wikipedia in Greenlandic is no more.\n\nOnly around 60,000 people speak the Inuit language. And very few of them, it seems, ever cared much about the online encyclopedia. As a result, many of the entries were machine translations riddled with errors and nonsense.\n\nPerhaps a website no one visits shouldn’t be a problem. But its existence created the risk of a linguistic “doom spiral” for the endangered language. That could happen if new AIs were trained on the corrupt Wikipedia articles.\n\nIn September, administrators voted to close Greenlandic Wikipedia, citing possible “harm to the Greenlandic language.”\n\nThere’s a reason we’re late to the hate-fest around Elon Musk’s Cybertruck. That’s because 12 months ago, the polemical polygon was the #1 selling electric pickup in the US.\n\nSo maybe it would end up a hit.\n\nNope. Tesla is likely to sell only around 20,000 trucks this year, about half last year’s total. And a big part of the problem is that the entire EV pickup category is struggling. Just this month, Ford decided to scrap its own EV truck, the F-150 Lightning.\n\nWith unsold inventory building, Musk has started selling Cybertrucks as fleet vehicles to his other enterprises, like SpaceX.\n\nMore: Elon’s Edsel: Tesla Cybertruck Is The Auto Industry’s Biggest Flop In Decades (Forbes), Why Tesla Cybertrucks Aren't Selling (CNBC), Ford scraps fully-electric F-150 Lightning as mounting losses and falling demand hits EV plans (AP)\n\nDonald Trump launched a digital currency called $TRUMP just days before his 2025 inauguration, accompanied by a logo showing his fist-pumping “Fight, fight, fight” pose.\n\nThis was a memecoin, or shitcoin, not real money. Memecoins are more like merchandise—collectibles designed to be bought and sold, usually for a loss. Indeed, they’ve been likened to a consensual scam in which a coin’s issuer can make a bundle while buyers take losses.\n\nThe White House says there’s nothing amiss. “The American public believe[s] it's absurd for anyone to insinuate that this president is profiting off of the presidency,” said spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt in May.\n\nMore: Donald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure (Bloomberg), A crypto mogul who invested millions into Trump coins is getting a reprieve (CNN), How the Trump companies made $1 bn from crypto (Financial Times), Staff Statement on Meme Coins (SEC)\n\nIn 2023, Apple announced its “first-ever carbon-neutral product,” a watch with “zero” net emissions. It would get there using recycled materials and renewable energy, and by preserving forests or planting vast stretches of eucalyptus trees.\n\nCritics say it’s greenwashing. This year, lawyers filed suit in California against Apple for deceptive advertising, and in Germany, a court ruled that the company can’t advertise products as carbon neutral because the “supposed storage of CO2 in commercial eucalyptus plantations” isn’t a sure thing.\n\nApple’s marketing team relented. Packaging for its newest watches doesn’t say “carbon neutral.” But Apple believes the legal nitpicking is counterproductive, arguing that it can only “discourage the kind of credible corporate climate action the world needs.”\n\nMore: Inside the controversial tree farms powering Apple’s carbon neutral goal (MIT Technology Review), Apple Watch not a 'CO2-neutral product,' German court finds (Reuters), Apple 2030: Our ambition to become carbon neutral (Apple)\n\nWe asked Al Jean, the longest-serving showrunner, about all the conspiracy theories.\n\nIt’s a popular example of the “Mandela effect,” or a collective false memory.

    "title": "China may have reverse engineered EUV lithography tool in covert lab, report claims — employees given fake IDs to avoid secret project being detected, prototypes expected in 2028",
    "description": "China has reportedly built and begun testing a secret EUV lithography prototype using ASML-style laser-produced plasma technology. Yet, despite generating 13.5-nm light, the system remains unable to make chips and appears to be years away from achieving a complete, production-ready EUV manufacturing capability.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nA secret laboratory in China has quietly assembled a prototype extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography system and is now testing it stealthily, which means that the country may be close to replicating the most advanced technology that currently exists on Earth, reports Reuters.\n\nThe tool was reportedly developed by reverse engineering existing scanners from ASML and is said to be on-track to make prototype chips in 2028. If the information is correct, then Chinese scientists have made numerous breakthroughs across multiple disciplines in just a few years instead of decades, a scenario that appears extremely unlikely. Further analysis of the report indicates that China's laboratory is far from completing the tool, meaning that the country is years away from making chips using EUV lithography.\n\nThe system was reportedly completed in early 2025 inside a highly secured facility in Shenzhen and occupies nearly an entire factory floor. The Chinese machine reportedly generates EUV light with a wavelength of 13.5nm using the same laser-produced plasma (LPP) method as ASML Twinscan NXE machines, not the particle accelerator-based steady-state microbunching (SSMB) method designed at Tsinghua University or discharge-produced plasma (DPP) technology developed at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), which might prove the point that the system was reverse-engineered or at least contains a substantial amount of technologies pioneered by ASML.\n\nASML's laser-produced plasma (LPP) method uses tiny molten tin droplets, roughly 25–30 microns in diameter, which are injected into a vacuum chamber at a rate of about 50,000 droplets per second. Then, a high-power CO₂ laser first fires a low-intensity pre-pulse at each droplet, flattening it into a disk-like shape, followed by a more powerful main pulse that vaporizes the flattened tin and creates a superheated plasma with temperatures exceeding 200,000°C. This plasma emits isotropic EUV light, which is then collected by a large multilayer collector mirror and directed into the lithography system's reflective optics for patterning silicon wafers. This process repeats tens of thousands of times per second.\n\nThe machine is reportedly larger than the original, but it is operational in the sense that it can generate EUV radiation. However, it has not progressed to make usable chips as it still struggles to replicate 'the precision optical systems' features by Twinscan NXE systems. Furthermore, there is no word about power of the EUV light source, a crucial parameter that defines whether a tool can or cannot be used for volume production.\n\nThe report clearly states that the Chinese EUV scanner cannot currently be used to make chips, but the Chinese government reportedly wants the first chip prototypes to emerge in 2028, two or three years down the road. However, a more realistic target is 2030, four or five years from now, which is a long time. Meanwhile, from the report, it is not completely clear what stage the Chinese team is at today.\n\nThe report does not disclose which specific components of the optical system are the primary bottlenecks, as the article groups them rather generally. In particular, it is uncertain if the alleged EUV tool struggles to replicate the ultra-precise collector mirror system coated with multilayer molybdenum-silicon (Mo/Si) stacks, illuminator optics (which shapes and uniforms the beam using faceted mirrors), or projection optics (a series of aspheric mirrors for 4X – 8X reduction imaging with sub-nanometer wavefront errors). ASML outsources the development and production of these components to Carl Zeiss from Germany. If the developers failed to replicate the collector itself, then the rest of the machine can hardly be called an EUV lithography system, as technically, the only thing they have is some kind of light source that they have yet to learn how to use. Yet, even if the developers cannot replicate illuminator optics or projection optics (suggesting that the collector itself is there), it still means they do not have even a poorly working EUV lithography tool, but rather a set of certain components.\n\nWhen talking about advanced lithography equipment, we must keep in mind that such tools rely on seamless integration of sophisticated light sources, advanced optics, ultra-precise mechanical engineering, complex control software, and specialized materials, all of which must function reliably within nanometer-scale tolerances demanded by modern chip manufacturing. The story has no word about the state of the mechanical systems of the alleged tool: we know nothing about the wafer stocker system, wafer stages, or reticle stages, all of which are crucial for operation and yields.\n\nTo put China's EUV efforts into perspective, the secret lab is not even close to building an alpha tool. For now, what the Chinese lab has cannot even put the light on a wafer, save for printing lines and spaces, something ASML's tool could do in 2006, about 11 years before the company shipped its first Twinscan NXE:3400B system meant for high-volume manufacturing. Of course, reverse engineering certain components can give Chinese engineers a speed boost, but it remains to be seen how significant this one is going to be.\n\nAccording to Reuters's sources familiar with the effort, the Chinese EUV tool was 'developed' by a team that includes former engineers from ASML and recent university graduates, who allegedly reverse-engineered the company's EUV machines. The secret lab was so stealthy that its employees were given fake IDs to avoid detection of their concentration in one place by foreign spies.\n\nYet, it is unclear how any engineers from China could reverse engineer an EUV lithography scanner, as the Dutch company has never supplied one to China and hardly taught personnel from China how to service its EUV systems that are not allowed to be shipped to the People's Republic.\n\nReverse engineering a machine that contains over 100,000 parts is a hard task that takes hundreds of engineers with knowledge of the matter, which is why the secret entity led by the Government of China hired not only former engineers from ASML China, but also former employees of the Dutch company from elsewhere, presumably from Europe, Taiwan, and the U.S. For example, Lin Nan, formerly responsible for EUV light source technology at ASML, now leads a team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Shanghai Institute of Optics that has filed eight EUV-related patents in just 18 months. Yet, this may mean that he uses his experience and knowledge rather than trying to replicate what he did at ASML or reverse engineer what he did at ASML due to the absence of an EUV scanner in his lab.\n\n“It makes sense that companies would want to replicate our technology, but doing so is no small feat,” a statement by ASML published by Reuters reads.\n\nThe report says that around 100 recent university graduates are tasked with reverse-engineering parts from EUV and DUV lithography tools, with each workplace monitored by a dedicated camera that records the disassembly and reassembly process, an important part of the whole China's lithography program, according to the report. Employees who successfully put components back together receive bonuses. Yet again, a Twinscan NXE tool is a mechanism consisting of over 100,000 parts working together, not just a sum of all parts.\n\nTo sum up, China has reportedly built a secret prototype EUV lithography system and begun testing it, which suggests that the country may be closer to reproducing the most advanced chipmaking technology in existence than previously believed. However, details provided by the report indicate that China is still years — if not a decade — away from making chips using EUV lithography.\n\nThe machine can generate 13.5-nm EUV light using the same laser-produced plasma (LPP) method employed by ASML, which may demonstrate extensive reverse engineering of Western technology rather than the use of alternative domestic approaches. However, the tool is significantly larger than commercial systems available today, it cannot produce usable chips, and appears to struggle with other elements of EUV lithography, particularly ultra-precise optics supplied to ASML by Carl Zeiss. In fact, details about the system like light source power, optical subsystem maturity, and the state of critical mechanical components remain unclear.\n\nWhile China expects first prototype EUV chips to emerge in 2028, Reuters's sources suggest 2030 is more realistic. Yet, the whole effort relies heavily on recruiting former ASML engineers and reverse engineering parts from existing EUV and DUV tools, which are not only hard to develop, but are extremely hard to make. Meanwhile, there is no word whether the current team responsible for disassembling and reassembling components can actually make an ultra-complex machine consisting of over 100,000 parts work flawlessly to produce semiconductors in high volumes.\n\nFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.",

    "description": "In the last year, Ukraine's interceptors have gone from novel technology to being produced in the thousands every month.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's defense ministry said on Thursday that it has been supplying its troops with roughly 950 interceptor drones every day since the beginning of December.\n\nIn its statement, the ministry said these drones were specifically to \"counter enemy Shahed-type UAVs.\"\n\nReaching nearly 1,000 daily delivered interceptors is a significant milestone for the production of such drones, which were largely still in prototyping stages at the start of the year.\n\nThese interceptors are first-person-view drones designed to fly into and destroy enemy aerial systems, typically using explosives or direct impact. A typical interceptor drone flies with four motor-powered propellers, but unlike the usual quadcopters, it is often shaped like a bullet or a rocket.\n\nInitially built to destroy high-flying reconnaissance craft, they've since been evolved by Ukrainians to take down long-range attack drones at a low cost — primarily as a response to Russia launching large waves of Iranian-designed Shaheds this year.\n\n\"These systems strengthen protection against drone terror while preserving resources for intercepting cruise and ballistic missiles,\" Ukraine's defense minister, Denys Shmyhal, said in Thursday's announcement.\n\nThe defense ministry also said it's been working with more than 10 interceptor manufacturers and has placed more orders for next year.\n\nFor Ukraine, interceptors must be fast enough to chase down drones such as the Shahed-136, which flies at a typical speed of 115 mph, while remaining cheap so that Kyiv's troops can sustainably use hundreds of them a day. Russia has recently been attacking with roughly 5,500 Shahed-type drones a month.\n\nSome Ukrainian drone makers have also been attempting to develop interceptors that can catch the Geran-3, the Russian version of the jet-powered Shahed-238, which can reportedly fly at an estimated 230 mph.\n\nUkraine's new production capacity comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in November that his country was producing roughly 600 to 800 interceptors a day, falling short of his initial goal.\n\nIn July, Zelenskyy had set a production target of 1,000 interceptors a day.\n\nUkraine's volunteer movements directly sponsor some interceptor drones for select military units, though their quantity is often limited compared to the scale of what the Ukrainian government provides.\n\nFor example, deliveries of the Wild Hornets' Sting, a $2,500 interceptor, were mostly sponsored this year by the Sternenko Foundation, a local crowdfunding organization.",

    "description": "Even as AI roles increase, mentions of the technology in job listings are down. It's a sign that bosses already expect you to use the technology.",
    "fullText": "That job description you're reading might not mention AI, but an employer will likely still expect you to know how to use it.\n\nA new snapshot of job listings from career platform Ladders showed that, while the number of AI roles listed on the site has tripled since 2021, the share of postings mentioning AI has decreased.\n\nIt's an indication that more employers are viewing technology as an everyday skill rather than as a differentiator, Marc Cenedella, founder and CEO of Ladders, told Business Insider.\n\n\"It will be mentioned less and less in the same way that Microsoft Office isn't mentioned in job postings anymore,\" he said.\n\nAmong about a dozen job categories Ladders reviewed, each saw a drop in postings that name-checked AI. For design and UX roles, AI mentions dropped from 56.7% of jobs in 2021 to 44.6% in 2025. Listings for product management positions registered a similar decrease.\n\nEven in software engineering, where the proliferation of coding agents has raised concerns that junior coders, in particular, will have a harder time finding work, AI references in job listings decreased from 53.5% to 45.8% in the four-year span.\n\nMentions of AI in job listings could pick up again, Cenedella said, if specialized tools emerge in different industries, though he said that might not happen until sometime in 2026 or 2027.\n\nIf that shift does come, it might mean that people in areas such as sales, pharmaceuticals, or semiconductors could need to demonstrate fluency with specific AI applications or methods for using the technology, Cenedella said. Employers could then start calling out those skills in job postings.\n\nThe overall drop in mentions of AI doesn't mean interest in the technology is fading, especially in certain areas. Ladders found that about 525,000 leadership and executive roles include AI references, up from 213,000 in 2021. All told, in 2025, the technology has been mentioned in 45% of executive postings on the site.\n\nRoles that aren't primarily technical — areas like finance, ops, design, sales, and project management — are seeing some of the fastest increases in AI skills adoption, Ladders found.\n\nOne reason, Cenedella said, is because the technology is moving so fast.\n\nOverall, Ladders said that jobs specifically about AI, such as engineering roles, shot up on its site to 6.7 million in 2025 from 2.1 million in 2021.\n\nRegardless of whether a job posting mentions AI, a boss will likely want you to be able to use it, Agur Jõgi, chief technology officer at the software company Pipedrive, told Business Insider.\n\n\"It's just like a ticket to the game,\" he said.\n\nJõgi said that you need to understand how AI is transforming your field and how it's affecting your job. \"That enables you to move as fast as the rest of the industry is moving,\" Jõgi said.\n\nJõgi said that if you're a holdout who's resisting using the technology, it could mean you're in for longer days if you want to keep up with colleagues who are going all in.\n\nEventually, as more people embrace AI, the early adopters who juiced their workplace productivity through AI will see that advantage fade, he said. To maintain it, Jõgi said, these go-getters will need to develop a fresh advantage.\n\n\"To beat the competition, you need to do something smarter, or you need to do slightly more,\" he said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "fullText": "Study author says tech companies are reaping benefits of artificial intelligence age but society is left to pay cost\n\nThe AI boom has caused as much carbon dioxide to be released into the atmosphere in 2025 as emitted by the whole of New York City, it has been claimed.\n\nThe global environmental impact of the rapidly spreading technology has been estimated in research published on Wednesday which also found that AI-related water use now exceeds the entirety of global bottled-water demand.\n\nThe figures have been compiled by the Dutch academic Alex de Vries-Gao, the founder of Digiconomist, a company that researches the unintended consequences of digital trends. He claimed they are the first attempt to measure the specific effect of artificial intelligence rather than datacentres in general as the use of chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini soared in 2025.\n\nThe figures show the estimated greenhouse gas emissions from AI use are also now equivalent to more than 8% of global aviation emissions. His study used technology companies’ own reporting and he called for stricter requirements for them to be more transparent about their climate impact.\n\n“The environmental cost of this is pretty huge in absolute terms,” he said. “At the moment society is paying for these costs, not the tech companies. The question is: is that fair? If they are reaping the benefits of this technology, why should they not be paying some of the costs?”\n\nDe Vries-Gao found that the 2025 carbon footprint of AI systems could be as high as 80m tonnes, while the water used could reach 765bn litres. He said it was the first time AI’s water impact had been estimated and showed that AI water use alone was more than a third higher than previous estimates of all datacentre water use.\n\nThe figures are published in the academic journal Patterns. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said earlier this year that AI-focused datacentres draw as much electricity as power-thirsty aluminium smelters and datacentre electricity consumption is expected to more than double by 2030.\n\n“This is yet more evidence that the public is footing the environmental bill for some of the richest companies on Earth,” said Donald Campbell, the director of advocacy at Foxglove, a UK non-profit that campaigns for fairness in tech. “Worse, it is likely just the tip of the iceberg. The datacentre construction frenzy, driven by generative AI, is only getting started.\n\n“Just one of these new ‘hyperscale’ facilities can generate climate emissions equivalent to several international airports. And in the UK alone, there are an estimated 100-200 of them in the planning system,” said Campbell.\n\nThe IEA has reported that the largest AI-focused datacentres being built today will each consume as much electricity as 2m households with the US accounting for the largest share of datacentre electricity consumption (45%) followed by China (25%) and Europe (15%).\n\nThe largest datacentre being planned in the UK, at a former coal power station site in Blyth, Northumberland, is expected to emit more than 180,000 tonnes of CO2 a year when at full operation – the equivalent to the amount produced by more than 24,000 homes.\n\nIn India, where $30bn (£22.5bn) is being invested in datacentres, there are growing concerns that a lack of reliability from the National Grid will mean the construction of huge diesel generator farms for backup power, which the consultancy KPMG this week called “a massive … carbon liability”.\n\nTechnology companies’ environmental disclosures are often insufficient to assess even the total datacentre impact, never mind isolating AI use, said De Vries-Gao. He noted that when Google recently reported on the impact of its Gemini AI, it did not account for the water used in generating the electricity needed to power it.\n\nGoogle reported that in 2024 it managed to reduce energy emissions from its datacentres by 12% due to new clean energy sources, but it said this summer that achieving its climate goals was “now more complex and challenging across every level – from local to global” and “a key challenge is the slower-than-needed deployment of carbon-free energy technologies at scale”.\n\nGoogle was approached for comment.",

    "description": "Smith was judged to have been caught behind despite the technology not matching up again",
    "fullText": "Jamie Smith was at the centre of the latest controversy with Snicko technology during a tense day of Test cricket at the Adelaide Oval.\n\nSmith looked to hook a short ball from Pat Cummins and seemingly missed the ball which flew through to Alex Carey behind the stumps.\n\nCarey, Cummins and co. all appealed believing Smith to have made contact with the ball but the England batter was ready to review the umpire’s decision.\n\nBut, the umpire decided to send for a review to see if the ball had cleanly landed in Carey’s hands before making a decision on the field. As part of that process a replay of the incident was shown with Snicko showing a spike after the ball had passed Smith’s bat. At the same time there seemed to be a gap between the bat and ball but the third umpire ruled that Smith had hit the ball and was out.\n\nEngland captain Ben Stokes, who was batting at the time, dropped his head in disbelief when the decision was shown on the big screen. Smith’s dismissal left England 159-6 and over 200 runs behind Australia’s first innings total of 371.\n\nThe controversy was just one of several incidents on day two in which the technology process was questioned. Earlier examples saw Smith glove the ball to Usman Khawaja at second slip and Joe Root get an inside edge through to Carey. In both instances the ball bounced before reaching the respective fielders.\n\nOn Test Match Special, Alex Hartley labelled the controversies as ‘ridiculous’ and claimed that the Snicko technology needed ‘sacking’.\n\nShe said: “It is going to boot off here. This is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. This is where Snicko needs sacking.\n\n“The third umpire said there is nothing obvious there as he could see a gap between the bat and ball. Jamie Smith is convinced he didn't hit it. Australia have gone up and made a loud noise because everybody knows you don't trust Snicko now, so you appeal for everything and review it if you have to.\n\n“Ben Stokes has his hands on his hips. Smith has gone off shaking his head.”\n\nHer view was echoed by former England players Greame Swann and Steven Finn on TNT Sports who both called out the inaccuracies in the technology and for it to be removed.\n\n“It just doesn’t make sense,” said Swann, “Cricket makes itself open to ridicule sometimes.”\n\nThe incident follows yesterday’s controversy over Alex Carey’s DRS review which resulted in him being given not out on 72 despite hitting the ball.",

The jeans use the brand's namesake compression technology to create a stretchy, sculpting fit that moves with me but doesn't feel restrictive or look like jeggings. I tried five pairs to see which ones felt most worth it, and in the end, the SPANXshape Authentic 360 Wide Leg Jeans ($158) came out on top. The washed black color I have looks expensive and chic, and the wide legs offer just enough wiggle room. And, magically, they also seem to snatch my waist as soon as I zip them up.\n\nBefore I go into more detail, I'll just say one thing: All bodies are beautiful just the way they are, and no tummy needs to be \"tamed\" in order to look cute in jeans. But if you're in the market for jeans that have some shaping qualities, here's everything to know about shopping for Spanx denim.\n\nReDefine: The most rigid of the three, this denim type is meant to sculpt the tummy, thighs, and bum for a smoother, more lifted appearance. The jeans come with functional pockets, zippers, and buttons, so despite their technical fabric, they still look like jeans. Size options range from 0 to 26, with petite and tall options.\n\nAuthentic 360: This style features a four-way stretch with medium compression and a panel that shapes the belly, waist, and backside. \"They provide a more classic denim experience in a more structured premium fabric that smooths,\" says Pascale Gueracague, the Chief Design Officer at Spanx. This collection has sizes ranging from XS to 3X with petite and tall options.\n\nEveryWear: This is the most relaxed, stretchy denim of the three. \"The newly upgraded EveryWear jeans are a pull-on style with 'TummyTamer Tech,' faux hardware, and a smooth waistband,\" says Gueracague. While the back pockets are functioning, they're missing front pockets and a fly zipper. Its sizes range from XS to 3X, with petite and tall options.\n\nThey snatch my waist and smooth my belly. I'm not going to lie: it was difficult to zip them up because they are pretty compressive in the belly area, and the fabric is somewhat thick and stiff. But these factors worked to flatten my lower belly and cinch my waist.\n\nHonestly? I feel really, really good about how my body looks in the Spanx Authentic 360 Wide Leg, especially being postpartum. The amount of shimmying it took to get into this pair made me doubt myself, but as soon as I turned around and saw my reflection, I had an instant boost of confidence.\n\nThey look and feel like expensive jeans. I'm usually skeptical of jeans that come in alpha sizing (XS-3X) — they tend to lack the quality and precise fit of jeans that come in numeric sizing. But Spanx as a whole has surprised me with just how high-end the jeans look and feel, all while remaining size-inclusive. You get functioning pockets all around, real hardware buttons and zippers, and a clean, chic finish that is unmistakably denim. They even come in a trendy barrel-leg design.\n\nI also love that these wide-leg jeans are made without any branding or stitching on the back pockets — because even though I'm obsessed with its jeans, I don't necessarily want the world to know that I'm wearing Spanx.\n\nThey don't feel great to sit in for long. With so much compression in the belly area, they may be uncomfortable if you're going on a long car ride or you're in a deep squat. You can always size up to make them more comfortable, but you may lose some of the shaping benefits in the process.\n\nIf I had to pick a favorite between the two pairs of Authentic 360 jeans I tested, it would be these. The 90s Straight Leg cut was a win, and while the compression did feel similar to the black wide-leg pair, for some reason, they felt slightly easier to button up. I suspect there could be a slight discrepancy between the different washes.\n\nWhile I did cuff them, the petite inseam length was the perfect length for my shorter frame. I found them easier to put on and supportive while walking around, but they weren't very comfortable when I was seated for long periods of time.\n\nMy tummy looks quite flat in these, but then again, so does my bum. I wish the fabric were a bit thinner in the seat area, or maybe even that they had a different panel just below the booty for an added lift. The compression level ultimately stifled the natural curves of my body.\n\nI can be picky about the color of my blue jeans, but the Elysian wash is the perfect mid-tone hue. It's not too dark and not too light, with a color that looks dimensional and not just a single wash of blue — ultimately, making the jeans look more expensive and high-quality.\n\nIn comparison to the Authentic 360 jeans, the EveryWear fabric feels a lot smoother, a bit thinner (yet still feels well-made and like real denim), and much, much stretchier. These are made for casual days: I could sit in them for hours without getting those painful red indentations on my skin.\n\nThey're not as sculpting as the other pairs. I felt my lower belly looked slightly smoothed and flattened, but I didn't get the same waist-snatching effect. The EveryWear jeans definitely put comfort at the forefront.\n\nI had to jump to get them on— but as soon as they were, they fit like a glove. No, seriously. It took some real effort to get these jeans over my bum, but I was justly rewarded. They never felt too snug or tight in any area, so they allowed my curves some room. Namely, my booty looked a little less flattened than it did in Authentic 360 jeans. \n\nI wish they had real pockets and zippers. I understand how removing pockets and limiting layers of fabric makes for a smoother appearance, but as a new mom, I could always use extra pocket space.\n\nThat said, these jeans are the most comfortable of the bunch, with ultra-soft fabric that feels like a second skin. The fabric has an incredible amount of stretch, so I could actually breathe in them all day. I'm not usually a fan of pull-on jeans — in most cases, I'd rather just wear leggings — but I could make an exception for this pair. And honestly, you can't really tell that the front is an illusion like many other similar high-waisted jeans, because there is a real fly button and raised seams that look legit.\n\nThey have the strongest level of compression out of all three Spanx denim fabrics. The ReDefine collection is the newest denim release from Spanx, and the jeans feature real hardware and pockets — which is a major bonus for my taste. I also like that the lack of excess material around the legs means I can tuck them into knee-high boots.\n\nThis sculpting denim takes it up a notch with \"strong compression,\" while the Authentic 360 and EveryWear denim are only medium compression. There's definitely some stretch to these jeans, but they do feel pretty tight and rigid by comparison — especially around the belly and bum. Ultimately, they weren't very comfortable to sit in.\n\nMore than the other styles, I found that the ReDefine range runs small. My typical size postpartum has been a 10 or 12. I tried this pair in a 12, and really struggled to put them on. I could have gone up a full size, or even two. My biggest piece of advice with the ReDefine line is to know your measurements, and when in doubt, go with the bigger size.\n\nThat said, this fabrication seems to have the best of both worlds. It looks and feels like real denim, bearing similar traits to my preferred Authentic 360 jeans (albeit much more compressive and tight around the belly). They do have a bit more stretch thanks to the Lycra, which is most akin to the EveryWear styles. Overall, if I had sized up, these could've been my favorite fit of them all. But in reality, the strong compression feels a bit too intense for my day-to-day.\n\nThis was my least favorite pair I tried. I first thought the ankle length would set them apart in a good way, but they just didn't look right on my frame. They're fabricated with Spanx Authentic 360 denim, which is a blend of cotton, polyester, and just 1% elastane, meaning they're not very stretchy.\n\nI disliked the cropped cut and patch pockets. This is, of course, a personal preference, but I do feel like the shorter cut \"shrinks\" me — and I'm already five feet flat. I prefer the full-length Wide Leg and 90s Straight styles instead because they make my legs look longer. My issue with the pockets is more personal — I feel like they draw the eye to my lower belly, and I'm more conscious of that area postpartum.\n\nThe denim is highly compressive, so it's best for active days. It definitely feels a bit tight, especially around my belly. This tightness isn't necessarily uncomfortable, but I feel it if I'm sitting down for too long. I didn't mind it when I was walking around and taking care of my baby on the go — in fact, I appreciated the support in those moments.\n\nSpanx jeans are a little high-maintenance. You can't just throw them in the regular laundry pile, because the dryer will wreck their elasticity. \"We recommend turning denim inside out, machine washing cold on a gentle cycle, and laying flat or hanging to dry\" explains Gueracague. \"High heat can break down stretch fibers, so it's best to avoid the dryer whenever possible, and there's no need for steaming, ironing, or dry cleaning.\"\n\nI also found that some pairs — like the intense compression in the ReDefine and Authentic 360 jeans — felt a bit too tight around the waistband in some situations (for sit-down brunches and car rides, I had to unbutton the top to allow myself some breathing room). \n\nThe EveryWear denim is much more comfortable when sitting down, but the pull-on style and faux pockets could be a turn-off for some.\n\nAll in all, I'm pretty impressed with Spanx's shaping denim. I'd say the most comfortable pair for casual wear is the EveryWear Wide Leg Jeans. But if I want that instant hourglass effect, I'll definitely be reaching for my Authentic 360 Wide Leg Jeans.\n\nSpanx jeans are a moderate splurge at $138-$168 a pair, and the sizing can be tricky. They also require more special care than cotton denim. That said, they truly are high-quality jeans that'll create silhouettes you didn't know you had in you.\n\nThere are very few denim brands I actually like on my petite, curvy figure, but Spanx happens to be one of them. They're more expensive than the cult-favorite Abercrombie jeans (about $90 per pair), yet cost less than the equally adored, yet higher-end, Mother Denim (about $258 per pair).\n\nAs our editors found with its Perfect Black Work Pants, Spanx clothing is consistently high quality, and you don't have to wear any shapewear undergarments with them. Plus, the clean branding allows you to wear them in casual settings or at the office.\n\nThey do, however, take special care to maintain. I let each pair of jeans I tested air dry (as suggested in the care instructions) so I didn't have to worry about them shrinking. They kept their compression qualities even after I washed them a handful of times, and since they proved their durability, I can tell that they'll be a staple in my wardrobe for a long time (as long as I keep taking good care of them).\n\nThe ReDefine jeans definitely run small, so I suggest measuring yourself and rounding up a size if you're unsure.\n\nThe rest are pretty true to size, though the compression creates a tighter feel, so you may want to size up anyway. I'm only five feet tall, and the petite 30-inch inseam worked best for me. The inseam lengths can vary by style, so check the size guide before you place your order.

    "fullText": "Keir Starmer’s office claims UK still in ‘active conversations’ about deal for tech industries in both countries to cooperate\n\nDowning Street insists the $40bn Tech Prosperity Deal between the US and UK that is on hold is not permanently stalled. The BBC reported on Tuesday evening that the prime minister’s office claimed that the UK remains in “active conversations with US counterparts at all levels of government” about the wide-ranging deal for the technology industries in both countries to cooperate.\n\nThe agreement, previously billed as historic, was paused after the US accused the UK of failing to lower trade barriers, including a digital services tax on US tech companies and food safety rules that limit the export of some agricultural products. The New York Times first reported British confirmation that negotiations had stalled.\n\n“We look forward to resuming work on this partnership as quickly as possible,” a Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement. She added that the UK government is committed to ensuring a “bond” with the US “and working together to help shape the emerging technologies of the future”.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTuesday’s developments come as relations between the US and the EU are likewise chilling. The Trump administration threatened European tech firms on Tuesday with economic penalties if the EU refused to roll back what it called “discriminatory actions”. The Office of the US Trade Representative accused the EU and some member states of “discriminatory and harassing lawsuits, taxes, fines and directives against U.S. services”.\n\nThe Trade Representative’s office said in a post on Twitter/X that these companies could face fees and restrictions on foreign services. The bureau singled out European companies, including Accenture, DHL, Spotify and Siemens as being able to “operate freely in the United States for decades, benefitting from access to our market and consumers on a level playing field.\n\n“If the E.U. and E.U. Member States insist on continuing to restrict, limit, and deter the competitiveness of U.S. service providers through discriminatory means, the United States will have no choice but to begin using every tool at its disposal to counter these unreasonable measures,” the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said on X.\n\nThomas Regnier, a spokesperson for the European Commission, responded by stressing that their rules “apply equally and fairly to all companies” operating in the region, according to the New York Times. “We will continue to enforce our rules fairly, and without discrimination,” he said.\n\nThe retaliation by the US follows a $140m fine slapped on Elon Musk’s X social media platform for violating transparency rules under the Digital Services Act. EU regulators took issue with the “deceptive design of X’s ‘blue checkmark’,” “lack of transparency of X’s ads repository” and “failure to provide researchers access to public data”. The EU has proven much more willing than the US to regulate, investigate and penalize tech giants, a point of contention with the Trump administration.",

    "fullText": "The US government is launching an early career hiring and talent development program to bring more technology and artificial intelligence employees to the public sector, as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to modernize government systems and stay ahead in the global tech race.\n\nThe launch of the “US Tech Force” is designed to address a technical and early career talent gap across the government, according to Scott Kupor, the director of the Office of Personnel Management which is spearheading the program. The effort comes amid a broader war for AI talent, with tech companies offering sizable salaries and other perks to attract top engineers and researchers.\n\nOPM plans to hire an initial cohort of 1,000 early career software engineers, data scientists, project managers and AI experts to be placed across government agencies for the two-year program. It will also partner with tech companies to recommend early career managers to take a leave of absence from their private-sector roles to join the Tech Force.\n\n“If you’re thinking about, long term, a career in technology, there is no bigger and more complex set of problems than we face in the federal government,” Kupor said in a call with reporters ahead of the program’s announcement Monday.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to implement AI to modernize and make more efficient systems across the federal government, including with the controversial Department of Government Efficiency. That effort, launched under Elon Musk earlier this year, is no longer operating as a “centralized” organization, officials said last month.\n\nPresident Donald Trump in July also signed an AI action plan, a set of initiatives and policy recommendations that centered on growing US AI infrastructure and scaling back regulation to promote US competitiveness.\n\nMembers of the new US Tech Force will work directly for individual agencies on projects determined by agency leadership. OPM will conduct an initial review and technical assessment of applicants and recommend approved candidates to agencies for final interviews and hiring decisions.\n\nApplications open Monday, and OPM hopes to have most members of the first cohort placed in roles within the first quarter of 2026.\n\nMembers of the Tech Force are expected to work on projects such as incorporating advanced AI into drones and other weapons at the Department of Defense, building out the Trump Accounts platform at the Internal Revenue Service, and using AI to improve intelligence at the State Department, among other initiatives, according to Kupor.\n\nThroughout the two-year program, OPM plans to bring in Silicon Valley CEOs and other executives for speaker events. It will also partner with around 25 tech companies to provide mentorship and career planning advice to members of the cohort. Microsoft, Adobe, Amazon, Meta and xAI are among the companies that have signed on as partners of the program.\n\nThe program will conclude with a job fair, where program members will have access to both public- and private-sector opportunities. Salaries for members of the Tech Force are expected to range from approximately $130,000 to $195,000.\n\n“There is an incredible race for talent in these areas … so part of what we want to do is be competitive on compensation,” Kupor said. He added that he wanted potential applicants to “understand that in doing this, they’re going to learn a bunch, they’re going to tackle really complex problems, and then they can ultimately go back to the private sector, if that’s what they want to do, and certainly will have the opportunity to maximize their financial opportunity as a result.”",

Hyundai and Kia must also outfit all future vehicles sold in the U.S. with a key piece of technology called an engine immobilizer and pay up to $4.5 million of restitution to people whose vehicles were damaged by thieves.\n\nThe settlement was reached by 35 states, including California, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. The vehicles eligible for fixes date as far back as 2011 and as recently as 2022. About 9 million eligible vehicles were sold nationwide.\n\nThefts of Hyundai and Kia vehicles soared in part because beginning in 2021, videos posted to TikTok and other social media demonstrated how someone could steal a car with just a screwdriver and a USB cable.

Ellison announced an investigation into the automakers in early 2023.\n\nEllison said the two companies installed engine immobilizers on cars sold in Mexico and Canada, but not widely in the U.S., leading to car thefts, crimes and crashes that injured and even killed people, including teenagers.\n\n“This crisis that we're talking about today started in a boardroom, traveled through the internet and ended up in tragic results when somebody stole those cars,” Ellison said at a news conference.\n\nHe was joined by Twin Cities officials, a woman whose mother was killed when a stolen Kia crashed into her parents’ vehicle and a man whose car was stolen nine times — as recently as Monday night, and including seven times after a previous software fix.\n\nUnder the settlement, Hyundai and Kia will install a zinc sleeve to stop would-be thieves from cracking open a vehicle's ignition cylinder and starting the car.\n\nEligible customers will have one year from the date of the companies' notice to get the repair at an authorized dealership. The repairs are expected to be available from early 2026 through early 2027.\n\nIn separate statements, the automakers said the agreement is one of multiple anti-theft efforts they have taken to help customers.\n\n“Kia is eager to continue working with law enforcement officers and officials at federal, state, and local levels to combat criminal car theft, and the role social media has played in encouraging it, and we remain fully committed to upholding vehicle security,” the company said.\n\nHyundai said, “We will continue to take meaningful action to support our customers and ensure peace of mind.”\n\nDura reported from Bismarck, North Dakota.",

The analysts noted that the firm's broader forecast also incorporates easing tariff pressures.\n\nIn line with that view, the analysts said that they expect earnings per share of real estate companies to rise from 5% this year to 15% next year, while those in consumer discretionary are expected to increase from 3% to 7%.\n\nIndustrial companies are also set for a major rebound, with EPS growth forecast to accelerate from 4% to 15%.\n\nSigns of this shift are already showing up in market action.\n\nIn a separate Friday report, Goldman noted that cyclical stocks have surged, beating defensive names for 14 trading days through Thursday — the longest streak in more than 15 years.\n\nEven so, Goldman analysts say the recent outperformance still isn't enough to reflect the firm's more optimistic growth outlook.

    "description": "This is a walkthrough of a new LMDB-based HNSW Rust vector store with drastically better performances than the previous random-projection-based one. This is a disk-based HNSW highly vector store inspired by the DiskANN technology and is now used by default in Meilisearch.",
    "fullText": "This article aims to address several limitations of the current vector database used by Meilisearch, and to introduce hannoy: a graph-based alternative to arroy using LMDB, which is already part of Meilisearch since v1.21 (Sept 15) as experimental and the default one since v1.29 (Dec 8).\n\nEarly testing has shown that the new system can reduce indexing times from 2 days to 2 hours, decrease the on-disk index size by a factor of 2, and speed up search by ~10 times. When it was first put into production on an instance with indexing difficulties, it reduced the indexing latency from 2 months to... 6 seconds.\n\nTo illustrate why this is the case, I'll run through some key heuristics of graph ANN algorithms and share a few snippets from the code that are particularly illustrative. Finally, we'll share some benchmarks comparing the new solution to what's currently in Meilisearch today.\n\nI am not a Meilisearch employee or affiliated with the company in any way other than being a co-author on their new vector database.\n\nI first became aware of Meilisearch back in March, when my company began considering their enterprise solution for hosting and indexing our collection of ~10 million documents. As any sane person would do, I stalked their GitHub and was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of in-house crates they maintained and used in their search engine. Amongst them was arroy: a k-d trees inspired vector database, based initially on Spotify's similarly named project: annoy.\n\nWasting no time, I made my first open source contribution ever to the repo and... welp, it's still not merged 😔. But hey, as the French say: that's life.\n\nFortunately, I was still able to merge a few other PR's in the meantime and learn more about how the algorithm worked. The back and forth I had with other devs throughout the process (notably with @irevoire) was instructive and overall made it a pretty enjoyable experience.\n\nAfter a couple of months of working on arroy, I naturally became aware of a few unsavoury trade-offs that lurked beneath the surface, and which ultimately motivated me to pursue a new approach.\n\nArroy is a k-d tree-based ANN algorithm, meaning that during indexing, you construct an ensemble of random partitions of your vector space, and at runtime, you search through them all simultaneously. To be more precise, it's random-projection-based.\n\nVisually, that process looks like the pic below:\n\nA widespread criticism of this type of approach is that search performance and latency degrade when the dimension of the embeddings exceeds about 20. Let's try to understand why.\n\nLooking at the code, we see that leaf nodes store as many vectors as the embedding dimension. This is a good and bad thing. In the extreme case where \"one leaf equals one vector\", e.g., you have a binary tree, each tree has height log2(n). By grouping d-many vectors in a leaf, trees can be built much faster since they only have height log2(n/d). For 1 million vectors of dimension 768, the numbers work out to building trees with heights of 10 versus 20; that's a 2.6 MiB versus 1.9 GiB in storage overhead for a single tree. This makes arroy B-tree-like, which is cool.\n\nWhere this is problematic, however, is at search time since you need to compare the query to each vector in a leaf. Even if you're only trying to retrieve the 10 nearest-neighbours, you still need to do 768 distance calculations 😔. That adds significant latency during retrieval.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no \"nice\" compromise; if you make leaves more granular, you need to store more nodes in the tree, which increases the index size in memory and exponentially increases build times, as we've seen.\n\nWhen using binary vectors and a bit-sampling hash, the memory overhead is just a single usize per node indicating the position of the random bit. This is the only case where we can afford to generate deeper trees, as storing a node on disk incurs next to no cost.\n\nAnother big problem with arroy is that the indexing algorithm is extremely read-heavy. That makes sense given that to create a hyperplane, you need to randomly sample points from the current node to generate clusters. The impact of this is so high that in some builds, over 90% of the time is spent doing IO and in page faults - a problem that only grows exponentially with dataset size. This phenomenon is still unresolved, as documented in arroy#145.\n\nOperational concerns aside, it's also just difficult to maintain arroy. There's a lot of mental gymnastics involved in understanding the recursive tree balancing algorithms, the creation and merging of temp files during partial builds, and the heuristics for auto-selecting build parameters. But hey, maybe that's a skill issue on my part.\n\nCurrent state-of-the-art ANN libraries employ graph-based approaches to achieve the optimal trade-off between search time and recall performance. Here, a navigable graph is built over all points in the database, and search is performed using a best-first traversal in log time. So rather than imposing structure on the dataset via separating hyperplanes like in arroy, techniques like HNSW and DiskANN focus more on building up pathways between points in local neighbourhoods.\n\nIf you haven't already read it, I'd recommend Pinecone's fantastic blog post on Faiss and the hnsw to get a working mental model of how these algorithms work. For the academically inclined, the original paper is also quite insightful.\n\nFor the search to converge quickly to the (approximate) nearest neighbour, the graph needs to satisfy what's known as the sparse neighbourhood graph (SNG) property. Put simply, points in a local neighbourhood of x should be closer to x than they are to each other. For the mathematically inclined, this property reduces to the relations below :\n\nThis equation is the \"secret sauce,\" if you will, of graph ANNs. Both the HNSW, DiskANN, and hannoy! rely on this to ensure efficient search.\n\nVector search over a graph has several advantages over space-partitioning approaches. First of all, it's extremely cheap to store node edges on disk at around ~200 bytes per vector even without using compressed bitmaps (which we do). For another, disk reads and distance computations at search time are significantly reduced as neighbours are explored one at a time instead of in large chunks. Insertions and deletions are also much simpler using a graph, as we only need to update the incoming/outgoing links from the modified nodes. In contrast, in arroy these operations potentially trigger tree re-balancing right up to the root.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, arroy is still great in the sense that it's disk-based, being built on top of LMDB. This means that you can build and search through indexes that are much larger than your machine's RAM using mmap. For reference, many popular HNSW implementations operate entirely in RAM, which is fast but requires multiple nodes and partitioning if the dataset becomes too large. So arroy was pretty avant-garde in that respect.\n\nHannoy is a graph-based successor to arroy with KV-backed storage via LMDB.\n\nThe goal of hannoy is to combine the best of both worlds from arroy and graph ANNs into a production-ready vector database that maintains and improves upon key metrics vs the legacy system. What's also neat is that it makes heavy use of crates maintained by the Meilisearch devs, such as heed, roaring-rs, and steppe.\n\nIts implementation is inspired by a few projects, notably Faiss' HNSW and the hnsw crate, but with significantly more support for zero-copy semantics, persistence, SIMD, and online updates & multi-phase indexing. There are also several novel techniques inspired by research papers to handle tasks such as graph merges and layer exploration.\n\nThe most interesting engineering challenge of the project was determining how to handle incremental insertions and deletions to the graph over its lifetime. After all, we expect users' databases to grow over time, and not all their data is available immediately. The industry standard for graph algorithms had been to periodically rebuild the index either on a cron-like schedule or after sufficient updates had accumulated. The FreshDiskANN paper summarizes this issue with this type of approach succinctly:\n\nIt would take about 1.5-2 hours on a dedicated high-end 48-core machine to build a good-quality HNSW index over 100M points. So we would need three dedicated machines for constantly rebuilding indices to maintain even six-hourly freshness guarantee over a billion point index. [1]\n\nLuckily for us, Microsoft has already solved this problem. The idea essentially boils down to avoiding eager updates to the graph by orchestrating a streaming delete/insert/merge operation once the size of a particular in-memory temporary index reaches a critical size. While this is certainly a proven strategy, with hannoy we aimed to implement something a bit less complicated, but which still makes liberal use of techniques from DiskANN (even though technically hannoy is an HNSW).\n\nWhen items are added or deleted from the graph, a special Updated key is written to the database pointing to the modified node. Before building the index, we generate a bitset of items that are (i) new, (ii) modified, or (iii) removed & pass those to the HnswBuilder. The deletion bitset plays a special role at the end of the build where instead of just removing any edge $(e,d)$ between an existing and deleted item, we explore the neighbourhood of $d$ to patch the links of $e$ à la DiskANN. This prevents \"gaps\" from appearing in the graph and ensures search still converges quickly (recall that SNG property from earlier 😉).\n\nThe code below shows how we accomplish this in hannoy:\n\nAnother interesting feature of hannoy is how the new graph (in RAM) is merged with the old one (from disk, in LMDB). For each batch of points to be inserted, we build a brand new HNSW in RAM. To ensure that this new graph connects to the old one, we reschedule the entry points of the old graph for re-indexing in the new one. Every time we need to access an item's links, we look in both memory and LMDB. This way, we can establish connections with the larger disk-based index in a lazy manner. This is essential, as otherwise, any new vectors inserted into the database after the initial build would be unreachable; you'd only be able to search in disjoint graphs, and recall would suffer.\n\nThis strategy actually works well in practice ! By re-indexing <<1% of the vectors in the original graph, we're able to merge on-disk and in-memory indexes seamlessly. To the best of my knowledge, this is a novel technique that no other HNSW implementations utilize for handling incremental builds, and it is essential to the use case at Meilisearch, where batch insertions are heavily used.\n\nThere are tons of other cool sub-problems like those that we address in hannoy, but I'll save those for another post. The important part to retain here is that hannoy is \"a DiskANN-inspired HNSW implementation with LMDB-backed storage\".\n\nI like making unsubstantiated claims about the performance of my system as much as the next guy, but there comes a point when it's time to share some hard numbers. That time is now!\n\nTo facilitate comparison between the old system and the new one, we'll utilize the trusty vector-store-relevancy-benchmark from Meilisearch, as featured in previous blog posts. The important metrics we'll be comparing are recall (1, 10, 50, 100), indexing time, retrieval latency, and disk usage for various datasets with differing embedding dimensions. To simplify the process, we'll run the benchmark on 1 million documents using cosine as the indexing/retrieval distance metric in full precision. We'll also run the benchmark using each database's preferred quantization format.\n\nWhen quantization is enabled, arroy by default uses the cosine distance over the [0,1]-valued vectors. In hannoy, we've noticed that the hamming distance between binary strings (x^y) is vastly more performant in both speed and recall. Intuitively, the speed part makes sense as the distance computation reduces to popcnt's !\n\nThe results I'll be sharing are cherry-picked from the much more complete benchmarking summary in hannoy.\n\nNote that the reported search latency numbers represent the cold-start times. In reality, search times will speed up as more of the database is loaded into the page cache. From the flamegraph below, we can see that ~25% of our time is spent on mdb_get calls, so running a few warmup queries could significantly reduce retrieval times.\n\nAs you can see from these numbers, hannoy certainly improves upon all of the metrics we discussed - and by quite a large margin. In some cases, indexing times drop by nearly 10x, while the same amount improves search latencies.\n\nHaving a bit of free time on my hands, I thought I'd tackle writing the Python bindings for hannoy using pyo3. With these in place, it becomes much easier to integrate the project with the renowned ANN Benchmarks leaderboard.\n\nWhat's cool here is that even with the log(n) lookups from LMDB and potential page faults in our mmap, we're still beating in-memory annoy (arroy but in C) and competitive enough with Faiss' implementation. This graph indicates that we still have some work to do in terms of performance. Still, considering it was an initial implementation thrown together fairly quickly, it's certainly a good start. The most essential things for hannoy are ensuring that we keep the same API as arroy to facilitate integration in Meilisearch, and of course, that it improves on the metrics with respect to the previous system.\n\nI covered a lot of ground in this blog post, but still haven't answered the essential question \"Why the HNSW and not DiskANN?\" - and to be honest, I still don't have a satisfactory answer.\n\nOn one hand, the HNSW seemed the easiest out of the two to implement, given our constraint of using LMDB as a storage backend (DiskANN has a lot of async IO going on to maximize throughput on SSD reads, which aren't as straightforward to implement using mmap). From another perspective, HNSW is the gateway to graph ANNs and seemed like a good first approach to try out, validating whether this was a valid alternative to Meilisearch's prevailing vector database. If convincing results could be obtained with relatively little effort, it was certainly worth trying out. That being said, DiskANN and FreshDiskANN certainly influenced many of my design choices throughout, and I'm sure the project will evolve to resemble them more closely.\n\nI published this article everywhere on the internet, and if you want to comment, please take a look at Lobste.rs, Hackernews, Reddit, Twitter, Bsky or even post a comment in here 👇",
