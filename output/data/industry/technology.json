    "description": "Neuroscientist Jared Cooney Horvath said older generations “screwed up” giving students access to so much technology: “I genuinely hope Gen Z quickly figures that out and gets mad.”",
    "fullText": "In 2002, Maine became the first state to implement a statewide laptop program to some grade levels. Then-Governor Angus King saw the program as a way to put the internet at the fingertips of more children, who would be able to immerse themselves in information.\n\nKing’s initial efforts have been mirrored across the country. In 2024, the U.S. spent more than $30 billion putting laptops and tablets in school. But more than a quarter century and numerous evolving models of technology later, psychologists and learning experts see a different outcome than the one King intended. Rather than empowering the generation with access to more knowledge, the technology had the opposite effect.\n\nEarlier this year, in written testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, neuroscientist Jared Cooney Horvath said that Gen Z is less cognitively capable than previous generations, despite its unprecedented access to technology. He said Gen Z is the first generation in modern history to score lower on standardized tests than the previous one.\n\nWhile skills measured by these tests, like literacy and numeracy, aren’t always indicative of intelligence, they are a reflection of cognitive capability, which Horvath said has been on the decline over the last decade or so.\n\nCiting Program for International Student Assessment data taken from 15-year-olds across the world and other standardized tests, Horvath noted not only dipping test scores, but also a stark correlation in scores and time spent on computers in school, such that more screen time was related to worse scores. He blamed students having unfettered access to technology that atrophied rather than bolstered learning capabilities. The introduction of the iPhone in 2007 also didn’t help.\n\n“This is not a debate about rejecting technology,” Horvath wrote. “It is a question of aligning educational tools with how human learning actually works. Evidence indicates that indiscriminate digital expansion has weakened learning environments rather than strengthened them.”\n\nThe writing was perhaps already on the wall. Fortune reported in 2017 that Maine’s public school test scores had not improved in the 15 years the state had implemented its technology initiative. Then-Governor Paul LePage called the program a “massive failure,” even as the state poured money into contracts with Apple.\n\nGen Z will now have to face the ramifications of eroding learning capabilities. The generation has already been hit hard by the transformations of the 21st century’s other technological revolution: generative AI.\n\nEarly data from a first-of-its-kind Stanford University study published last year found AI advancements to have “significant and disproportionate impact on entry-level workers in the U.S. labor market.” But a less capable population means more than just poorer job prospects and less promotions, Horvath warned; it endangers how humans are able to overcome existential challenges in the decades to come.\n\n“We’re facing challenges more complex and far-reaching than any in human history—from overpopulation to evolving diseases to moral drift,” he told Fortune. “Now, more than ever, we need a generation able to grapple with nuance, hold multiple truths in tension, and creatively tackle problems that are stumping the greatest adult minds of today.”\n\nClassroom technology usage has ballooned in recent years. A 2021 EdWeek Research Center poll of 846 teachers found 55% said they are spending one to four hours per day with educational tech. Another quarter reported using the digital tools five hours per day.\n\nWhile teachers may be intending for these tools to be strictly educational, students often have different ideas. According to a 2014 study, which surveyed and observed 3,000 university students, students engaged in off-task activities on their computers nearly two-thirds of the time.\n\nHorvath blamed this tendency to get off-track as a key contributor to technology hindering learning. When one’s attention is interrupted, it takes time to refocus. Task-switching also is associated with weaker memory formation and greater rates of error. Grappling with a challenging singular subject matter is hard, Horvath said. For the best learning to happen, it’s supposed to be.\n\n“Unfortunately, ease has never been a defining characteristic of learning,” he said. “Learning is effortful, difficult, and oftentimes uncomfortable. But it’s the friction that makes learning deep and transferable into the future.”\n\nSustained attention to a singular subject is anathema to how technology today has been deployed, argues Jean Twenge, San Diego State University psychology professor studying generational differences and the author of 10 Rules for Raising Kids in a High-Tech World. More time on screens isn’t just ineffective in facilitating learnings; it’s counterproductive.\n\n“Many apps, including social media and gaming apps, are designed to be addictive,” Twenge told Fortune. “Their business model is based on users spending the most time possible on the apps, and checking back as frequently as possible.”\n\nA Baylor University-led study published in November 2025 uncovered why this is: TikTok required the least amount of effort to use, even less than Instagram Reels and YouTube shorts, by balancing relevant videos with surprising and unexpected content.\n\nConcerns over social media addiction have become so dire that 1,600 plaintiffs, across 350 families and 250 school districts, filed a lawsuit alleging Meta, Snap, TikTok, and YouTube created addictive platforms leading to mental health challenges like depression and self-harm in children.\n\nHorvath proposed a swath of solutions to Gen Z’s tech problem, at least as it pertains to classroom use. Congress, he suggested, could impose efficacy standards to fund research on what digital tools are actually effective in the classroom. The legislature could also require strong limits on tracking behavior, building profiles, and collecting data on minors using tech.\n\nSome schools have taken matters into their own hands. As of August 2025, 17 states have cracked down on cellphone use in school, banning the technology during instructional time; and 35 states have laws limiting the use of phones in the classroom. In fact, more than 75% of schools have said they have policies prohibiting cellphone use for non-academic purposes, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, though enforcing those bans have been met with variable success.\n\nUltimately, Horvath said, the loss of critical thinking and learning skills is less of a personal failure and more of a policy one, calling the generation of Americans educated with gadgets victims of a failed pedagogical experiment.\n\n“Whenever I work with teenagers I tell them, ‘This is not your fault. None of you asked to be sat in front of a computer for your entire K-12 schooling,’” Horvath said. “That means we…screwed up—and I genuinely hope Gen Z quickly figures that out and gets mad.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "description": "Toyota’s most senior software executive has revealed that the carmaker is considering banning drivers from switching off vehicle safety features in the Combination of increasing government regulations and Toyota’s goal of zero traffic accidents are forcing hard questions about turning safety technology off",
    "fullText": "Toyota’s most senior software executive has revealed that the carmaker is considering banning drivers from switching off vehicle safety features in the future.\n\nGovernment regulations normally shape the degree of strictness a carmaker imposes, and Australian and European safety regulations in recent years have started to impose various lane keeping, speed limit awareness and driver monitoring systems in cars.\n\nAt present, those systems can typically be switched off manually at the touch of a button or swipe of a screen, if the driver deems that they would prefer to manage these processes themselves.\n\nBut Toyota software development centre president Akihiro Sarada says that the Japanese carmaker is serious about its mission of “zero traffic accidents” — not just deaths, but all car accidents.\n\n“Our ultimate goal is to eradicate all traffic accidents, and of course, autonomous driving is a technology that is necessary to realise a safe environment,” said Sarada.\n\n“We have to study and decide if we would enable an ‘off’ button.”\n\nAllowing drivers to operate the vehicle however they see fit, including by exceeding the speed limit or approaching lane markings to hit a corner apex, may not be compatible with achieving Toyota’s goal of eliminating accidents.\n\nSarada said that Toyota was considering allowing drivers to temporarily disable safety features — or drive in the manner they see fit — in two environments: on roads where the car’s software knows no other cars or pedestrians are around, and on the racetrack.\n\n“If it is safe, for example, if it is on the circuit, [autonomous driving and sporty human driving] can co-exist,” said Sarada.\n\n“In the area[s] where drivers are able to have fun driving, then we want them to have the discretion to decide the way they drive their cars.\n\n“We have to really study in detail whether or not it is really mandatory for us to control that detail, to the level where we have to forbid them to enjoy their driving.”\n\nToyota’s software boss also hinted that connected-car technology — online systems that detect other cars, pedestrians and road conditions — might even allow keen drivers to drive as they see fit on the public road, but that warnings would kick in if risks increased.\n\n“Drivers want to have excitement in driving. By using connected data, they can receive announcements that under [certain] conditions they can have more fun, that right now it is safe, but several seconds later, [if] there is a risk [they can] receive a warning beforehand,” Sarada explained.\n\nBut even this ‘leniency’ could, in theory, stop a driver from disabling safety technologies like lane-centring or speed limit controls on country roads if other cars, cyclists or particularly pedestrians are present in the area.\n\nIt’s a balancing act within Toyota between departments like Sarada’s — tasked with deploying software that reduces accidents, injury and death — and performance-arm GR, which must convince buyers that they should spend their cash on sporty, fun-to-drive cars.\n\nFor decades, Toyota has run ahead of some vehicle safety regulations. For more than 20 years, drivers and passengers in Toyota and Lexus models have been unable to input satellite navigation destinations while the vehicle is in motion.\n\nThat’s a common practice that other carmakers would typically allow, sometimes via rotary dials — often perceived as ‘safer’ to use while moving — but also often via simple touchscreen inputs.\n\nIn recent years other firms have followed Toyota’s lead on blocking some touchscreen functions while the vehicle is in motion. The two key smartphone mirroring products, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, both prevent most on-screen keyboard use while driving.\n\nEuropean regulations have also started to encroach on touchscreen use via that continent’s Advanced Driver Distraction Warning requirements, which will come into force for all new vehicles registered in the EU from July 2026.\n\nEven in the EU, however, safety features — including speed warning, stability control and lane-keeping are typically allowed be switched off, though all restart at the next vehicle ignition and a driver would be held responsible for increasing the risk of a crash if a safety system is deactivated.\n\nTypically, governments — including in Australia and Europe — issue broad guidelines for how safety features should work, leaving precise implementation decisions up to carmakers.",

    "fullText": "Narendra Modi’s thirst to supercharge economic growth is matched by US desire to inject AI into world’s biggest democracy\n\nIndia celebrates 80 years of independence from the UK in August 2027. At about that same moment, “early versions of true super intelligence” could emerge, Sam Altman, the co-founder of OpenAI, said this week.\n\nIt’s a looming coincidence that raised a charged question at the AI Impact summit in Delhi, hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi: can India avoid returning to the status of a vassal state when it imports AI to raise the prospects of its 1.4 billion people?\n\nModi’s hunger to harness AI’s capability is great. He compared it on Thursday to a turning point that resets the direction of civilisation, such as “when the first sparks were struck from stone”. The most common analogy heard among the thousands of visitors to the summit was the dawn of electricity, but Modi was talking about fire.\n\nHis desire to use AI to supercharge Indian economic growth is matched by that of the big US tech companies. OpenAI, Google and Anthropic all played prominent roles at the summit, announcing deals to get ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude AIs into more people’s hands.\n\nThe Trump administration, seeing AI as central to its battle for supremacy with China, was clearing the path for the three AI companies. The US government signed the Pax Silica, a technology agreement that binds India closer to US tech and away from Beijing.\n\nAt the signing, Jacob Helberg, the US under secretary of state for economic affairs, emphasised the threat from China if India should even think about looking elsewhere for its AI. “We have seen the lights of a great Indian city extinguished by a keystroke,” he said, in an apparent reference to a suspected Chinese cyber-attack on Mumbai in 2020.\n\nIndia lacks the semiconductors, power plants and vast gigawatt datacentres to go it alone. In common with most other countries, it faces a choice between US and Chinese AI models. Which they choose could have profound consequences for who controls India’s future, because if AI’s power emerges as predicted, it will not only tweak economic and social structures, but become their new bedrock.\n\nStuart Russell, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of California, Berkeley, who closely follows India’s progress, said: “If we get to AGI [artificial general intelligence], AI is going to be producing 80% of the global economy. All manufacturing, most agriculture, all services will be just done; managed by AI, produced by AI.”\n\nImagine, he said, an Indian village priced out of having a health centre. In the future, AI could design the hospital and “along comes a bunch of giant quad copters carrying the materials, and a bunch of robots come and assemble everything. Two weeks later, you’ve got a hospital.”\n\nIn this scenario, technology becomes integral to a country’s wellbeing. Elements of sovereignty can be fought over, but how successful that will be remains to be seen. AI’s power is such that its controller gains enormous leverage.\n\nAnthropic’s chief executive, Dario Amodei, told the summit: “It may sound absurd, but AI can even help India achieve a standout 25% economic growth.” If that were to happen, it would take India to a per-capita GDP in a decade that is equivalent to Greece today. How could a leader resist?\n\nModi’s tech secretary, Shri Krishnan, said India realised it must ally with like-minded countries to ensure it did not become “enslaved”. It is a high-stakes decision.\n\nIndia appears unlikely to turn to China, for now. It has the AI models, but there are tensions on the Himalayan border, and Chinese companies and leaders were scarce at the summit.\n\nWill India thrive with US AI? Silicon Valley companies talk of cooperation not control. Chris Lehane, OpenAI’s head of global policy, said: “We don’t see India as a customer, we see it as a strategic partner.”\n\nUS officials framed the deal with India as an alliance of two nations that “broke centuries of colonial rule”, and as “two great democracies saying we will build together”.\n\nThe Guardian asked Michael Kratsios, Donald Trump’s science and technology adviser, if India risked being controlled by the US under a form of digital colonialism.\n\n“I would say it is actually the opposite,” he said. “Any country that builds on top of the American AI stack will have the most open, independently controlled, secured stack the world has to offer. And that is why we are soon keen to share it with so many countries that are prioritising their AI sovereignty.”\n\nRussell sees another possibility. “I think the American companies want to get in at that high-school and middle-school level to create basically a bunch of AI addicts who can’t tie their shoelaces without the help of AI,” he said. “Silicon Valley has always been about eyeballs. You monetise later and it works. Google and Facebook generate vast amounts of money.”\n\nCould India build its own AI? It is investing billions in datacentres and semiconductor capacity, but it takes years to come online.\n\nAltman was asked on Thursday how Indian entrepreneurs could build their own AI and his response was blunt. “Look, the way this works is we’re going to tell you it’s totally hopeless to compete with us on training foundation and you shouldn’t even try, and it’s your job to try anyway and I believe both of those things.”\n\nIndia can press US tech companies to adapt their AIs to its kaleidoscope of languages and cultures, and attempt to insist on guardrails. There is much at stake. As the summit came to a close, Joanna Shields, a former Facebook and Google executive and a UK minister for internet safety, warned: “If we have a world where we are accepting models from just the global north, we will lose so much of our cultural diversity, our uniqueness as people, wherever we come from … We don’t want to develop a monoculture based on a handful of models that everybody uses around the world and we lose that richness of who we are, what makes us human.”",

    "description": "Some economists are warning there’s no sign of AI-related job displacement appearing in the labor data. Altman claimed it’s just a matter of time until it does.",
    "fullText": "As debate continues over AI’s true impact on the labor force, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said some companies are engaging in “AI washing” when it comes to layoffs, or falsely attributing workforce reductions to the technology’s impact.\n\n“I don’t know what the exact percentage is, but there’s some AI washing where people are blaming AI for layoffs that they would otherwise do, and then there’s some real displacement by AI of different kinds of jobs,” Altman told CNBC-TV18 at the India AI Impact Summit on Thursday.\n\nAI washing has gained traction as emerging data on the tech’s impact on the labor market tells a muddied, inconclusive story about how the technology is destroying human jobs—or if it has yet to touch them.\n\nA study published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research, for example, found that of thousands of surveyed C-suite executives across the U.S., the U.K., Germany, and Australia, nearly 90% said AI had no impact on workplace employment over the past three years following the late-2022 release of ChatGPT.\n\nHowever, prominent tech leaders like Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have warned of a white-collar bloodbath, with AI potentially wiping out 50% of entry-level office jobs. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski suggested this week the buy-now, pay-later firm would reduce its 3,000-person workforce by one-third by 2030 in part because of the acceleration of AI. Around 40% of employers expect to follow Siemiatkowski’s lead in culling staff down the line as a result of AI, according to the 2025 World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report.\n\nAltman clarified he anticipates more job displacement as a result of AI, as well as the emergence of new roles complementing the technology.\n\n“We’ll find new kinds of jobs, as we do with every tech revolution,” he said. “But I would expect that the real impact of AI doing jobs in the next few years will begin to be palpable.”\n\nData from a recent Yale Budget Lab report suggests Altman and Amodei’s vision of mass worker displacement from AI is not certain and is not yet here. Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Current Population Survey, the research found no significant differences in the rate of change of occupations mix or length of unemployment for individuals with jobs that have high exposure to AI from the release of ChatGPT through November 2025. The numbers suggested no significant AI-related labor changes at this juncture.\n\n“No matter which way you look at the data, at this exact moment, it just doesn’t seem like there’s major macroeconomic effects here,” Martha Gimbel, executive director and cofounder of the Yale Budget Lab, told Fortune earlier this month.",

    "fullText": "In 2026, it’s a scary time to work for a living.\n\nGone are the days of quiet quitting, the Great Resignation, and the highly visible union-organizing battles that began the decade and signaled that perhaps worker power was on the rise again in the US. Instead, much of that momentum is being crowded out of our minds by anxieties: a worsening affordability crisis, geopolitical instability, and the specter of artificial intelligence looming over the workplace.\n\nFor the tech CEOs leading the AI race and enriching themselves as they jostle for dominance, AI isn’t a phantasm at all, but a glimmering unicorn. When they predict AI is just months away from being able to do everything a software engineer does, or that it will one day take over CEOs’ jobs, their excitement for the future is palpable. For the rest of us, it’s hard to feel confident in their offhand remarks about how “some jobs will be obsolete, but many jobs will be created”. A 2025 Pew survey found that “64% of the public thinks AI will lead to fewer jobs over the next 20 years”, which is probably why only 17% of Americans say AI will have a positive effect on the US over the same time period.\n\nUncertain times like these call for scrutiny. Throughout 2026, the Guardian will publish Reworked, a reporting series that centers the human stakes as AI disrupts our workplaces, in ways both thrilling and alarming. Like this essay, the stories in this series will focus on workers’ real-world power and plights as well as the realities and exaggerations of the hype surrounding AI’s transformative possibilities.\n\nSo which version of the future of work awaits us? It is yet to be settled, which means there is still time to shift course.\n\nBlue-collar workers who have long grappled with algorithmic surveillance and optimization at work are now worrying that technological advancements will only make their jobs more dehumanizing. “[For] lower wage workers, there is concern about being replaced by robots. But on the other hand, there’s a lot of concern about being turned into robots,” Lisa Kresge, a senior researcher at the UC Berkeley Labor Center, told me.\n\nAnd white-collar workers are now wondering if their work will begin to resemble blue-collar labor – either because they will be similarly tracked and managed, or because they will need to switch to more manual work that’s resistant to being taken over by AI.\n\nIt may seem that workers haven’t been this vulnerable in a long time. In some ways, that’s true. But this is also a pivotal moment, one in which something unexpected is happening: society’s collective anxiety over AI is catalyzing workers to push back.\n\n“It is creating an opportunity,” Sarita Gupta, the Ford Foundation’s Vice President of US Programs and co-author of The Future We Need: Organizing for a Better Democracy in the Twenty-First Century, told me. “When you have a young Silicon Valley software engineer realize that their performance is tracked or undermined by the same logic as a working class warehouse picker, class divisions dissolve, and larger working-class movements for dignity are possible. That is what we’re starting to see.”\n\nPeople across industries and income brackets are anxious and frustrated, quite like they were when the Covid pandemic placed punishing demands on frontline workers and erased the boundaries between work and life for everyone else. Those struggles prompted power shifts: At the same time that workers led unionization efforts at Amazon warehouses and Starbucks locations around the US, the Great Resignation saw a record number of employees quit their jobs, and the ones who remained in the workforce began negotiating for and gaining better pay and conditions.\n\n“It was not a pretty time for a lot of workers. And so part of the resurgence of labor organizing from that period of time was in response to a lot of fears,” Kresge said.\n\nShe also sees the rise of AI as an opening for the labor movement to regain some of the power it’s lost after decades of attacks from employers. “I’m hopeful about the opportunity for technology to lift up some of the issues that have been under way in our economy for decades … in terms of how workers are treated and how we are distributing the rewards of productivity.”\n\nConditions for workers have been rough for a long while now. “Over time, unions have lost collective bargaining power, and a lot of that is due to the lack of laws that we need and enforcement of laws,” Gupta said. “For four decades, productivity soared while wages stayed flat, and unionization hit historic lows.” In 2025, only 9.9% of US workers were union members – the same percentage as 2024, but still the lowest numbers in almost 40 years.\n\nToday, the advent of AI is drawing the world’s attention to the extreme imbalance of power between employers and their employees – and people are getting worked up. Even if the outcomes are still undetermined, that’s a glimmer of possibility in bleak times.\n\nAI is still a nascent technology. Many of the predictions about what it will be capable of and how it will transform labor and the economy are just that – predictions. The question of worker power in the age of AI hasn’t been decided yet, even if billionaire CEOs with a vested interest in the unregulated dominance of AI keep implying that it has.\n\n“There is a concerted effort among many tech leaders to basically create mystification around AI as a tactic, to a large extent, to disempower workers, policymakers, and anyone who might be critical of the growing concentration of funding and resources in our society toward this goal,” Kresge told me.\n\nIn other words, take what these billionaires say with a grain of salt. The rise of AI is already transforming society, the economy, and our relationship to work, but a lot of these shifts are anticipatory, based on our belief in the potential of a technology that’s still being built.\n\n“We have to always remind ourselves that the direction of technology is a choice, right? We can use AI to build a surveillance economy that squeezes every drop of value out of a worker, or we can use it to build an era of shared prosperity,” Gupta said. “We know if technology were designed and deployed and governed by the people doing the work, AI wouldn’t be such a threat.”",

    "title": "The biggest names in AI are gathering for a summit in India. Here are 5 of the biggest takeaways.",
    "description": "From Sam Altman to Demis Hassabis, AI leaders gathered in India to speak about the future of the technology.",
    "fullText": "AI's biggest power players showed up in India on Thursday.\n\nOpenAI's Sam Altman, Anthropic's Dario Amodei, Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis, Microsoft's Brad Smith, Scale AI's Alexandr Wang, and Mistral's Arthur Mensch spoke in succession at the AI Impact Summit held in New Delhi.\n\nFrom a potential \"AI divide\" to calls for stronger global coordination, here are five of the biggest takeaways from the summit so far.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said the world must not let the digital divide \"become an AI divide.\" He said expanding access to compute infrastructure, connectivity, and training is essential as AI reshapes economies.\n\nPichai said AI represents \"the biggest platform shift of our lifetimes\" and could drive \"hyper progress\" across science, healthcare, and economic development. But its benefits are neither \"guaranteed nor automatic.\"\n\n\"We must be equally bold in tackling problems in regions that have lacked access to technology,\" Pichai said. \"We cannot allow the digital divide to become an AI divide. That means investing in compute infrastructure and connectivity.\"\n\nGovernments must act both as regulators and innovators to ensure AI improves public services and broadens opportunity, he added.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that while AI capabilities are advancing rapidly, there's a gap between those capabilities and real-world impact.\n\n\"There is this duality between the fundamental capabilities of the technology and the time that it takes for those capabilities to diffuse into the world,\" he said.\n\n\"There are just frictions to adopt things through enterprises, and I think even more so in the developing world,\" he added.\n\nThe Google DeepMind CEO said India will be a \"powerhouse for AI\" across the world. He praised summits that bring together scientists, policymakers, and technologists, the latter of whom he said can't be left alone navigating AI.\n\nHassabis said we're in \"one of the most momentous\" times in human history and compared AI to the advent of fire and electricity.\n\n\"It's gonna be something like 10 times the impact of the Industrial Revolution, but happening at 10 times the speed, probably unfolding in a matter of a decade rather than a century,\" he said.\n\nGiven this level of impact, he said we need to use a scientific approach to understand AI's capabilities and build guardrails so that the technology \"serves the purposes that we want.\"\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said rapid advances in AI could require new global governance mechanisms, something akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\n\"In particular, we expect the world may need something like the IAEA for international coordination of AI,\" Altman said, adding that such a body would need \"the ability to rapidly respond to change in circumstances.\"\n\nAltman said AI's trajectory could create risks that no single company or country can manage alone.\n\n\"We need a society-wide approach about how we're going to defend against this,\" he said, referring to the possibility of highly capable \"bio models\" becoming available.\n\nLong-term AI development is a responsibility to future generations, Altman also said, adding that it is a \"moral imperative\" to ensure future generations can benefit from and build upon technological progress.\n\nMeta's former chief scientist said we're still missing something \"big\" in AI.\n\n\"Why do we have systems that can pass the bar exam and win mathematics olympiads? But we don't have domestic robots. We don't even have self-driving cars,\" LeCun said. \"We certainly do not have several cars that can teach themselves to drive in 20 hours of practice like in 17-year-old.\"\n\nHe said that babies and animals have a much better understanding of the physical world around them than any AI systems today, which is why we don't have \"smart robots\" yet.\n\nHe said what is needed is world models — \"mental models of the world that allow us to think ahead, apprehend new situations, plan, sequence of actions, reason, and predict the consequences of our actions.\"\n\nIn November, LeCun announced his departure from Meta, where he had worked for 12 years, and said he would launch his own AI company. His new startup, AMI Labs, focuses on building world models.\n\nMicrosoft president Brad Smith said we need to make AI effective for the Global South, and that needs conscious planning.\n\n\"We need to make AI as effective in every language as it is in English, and today, it is not,\" he said. \"Performance tests show that's the case.\"\n\n\"One of the good things to come out of this week is new announcements to better data in other languages, to provide better tools and measurement systems for AI that is built in other languages,\" he added.\n\nThe other thing that needs to be done is to work on problems that matter to the Global South. That means focusing on improvements in agriculture for India, and addressing food security in Africa.",

    "fullText": "Nostalgia is everywhere on the internet right now.\n\nWith doomsayers predicting that AI could bring about the apocalypse, this January marking the highest number of layoffs to kick off a year since 2009, and ongoing political unrest, people are harking back to simpler times.\n\nRather than looking forward to the year ahead, many people hailed in 2026 by reminiscing about 2016 — posting throwback pictures and declaring that 2026 will be the new 2016, set to songs released around that time, such as Zara Larsson's \"Lush Life.\"\n\nMany have thrown it back even further — think pieces and experts have dubbed 2026 the \"year of analog.\" This trend is less about trying to live like it's 2016, but more 2006 — or 1996.\n\nThe tech-induced nostalgia is shining through in recent Reddit posts that ask: \"What is a luxury item from 20 years ago that is basically worthless trash today?\"\n\nThis question has been posted on Reddit in several threads over the last few months. These threads have amassed thousands of comments in the past few weeks.\n\nAmong the items people are discussing are portable GPS devices, digital cameras, iPods, and paying for novelty ringtones.\n\n\"I paid $700 for one of those in... 2003?\" one Reddit user says of a portable GPS device. \"Best purchase ever because I'm directionally challenged and relied on MapQuest (!) printouts on the passenger seat.\"\n\n\"Ringtones. Oh you want one of your ringtones to be a 5 seconds snippets from Lose yourself. That'll be 8.50$. People would flex about their ringtones,\" another Redditor wrote.\n\nIn another post, a Redditor reminisced about USB storage drives.\n\n\"I remember in 5th grade, a flash drive was on our required supplies list, and I got one that was 512mb. A teacher told me that was more than I would need for the rest of my life,\" they wrote.\n\nThe PalmPilot, BlackBerry, plasma TVs, and SD cards have also gotten repeat mentions.\n\nSome of these pieces of tech — namely the digital camera — have been reborn in recent years as status symbols for a generation craving a time that felt more authentic.\n\nAs part of the push to get offline, many Gen Z and millennials are rejecting new technology by Bricking their phones — blocking certain apps and websites — and leaning into in-person hobbies.\n\nKathryn Jezer-Morton recently wrote for The Cut that 2026 is all about \"friction-maxxing\" — a rejection of the numbing convenience that AI and technology bring us, which Jezer-Morton says is distancing us from life itself.\n\nIt's as if consumers are harking back to a time when it felt as though technology was made to work for us, rather than make our lives more complicated.\n\n\"After a period of intense euphoria and excitement with regards to AI, we are coming down on the other side of the hill,\" Thomas Roulet, a professor of organizational sociology and leadership at the University of Cambridge, told Business Insider.\n\n\"The tool is democratised and has become normalised, and people realise it hasn't made their work easier or less intense — quite the opposite,\" he added.\n\n\"So it's normal to find GenZ employees — who will have to go through their entire career using those tools — to be disillusioned,\" he said.\n\nWhen the future of AI is being predicted by some tech execs and experts as a white-collar bloodbath with millions of workers laid off, or that those living without AI glasses could be at a \"cognitive disadvantage,\" it's no wonder.\n\nIn an uncertain time, one thing that's sure in 2026: de-digitalizing your life is officially a status symbol.",

In 2022, the DMV had accused Tesla of misleading consumers by using “autopilot” and “full self-driving” for its advanced driver-assistance features.\n\nThe DMV narrowed its focus in December to the term “autopilot” as Tesla revised its use of the term “full self-driving” to clarify that driver supervision is required. “Autopilot” enables Tesla vehicles to accelerate, brake and remain within their lanes on highways. “Full self-driving” allows vehicles to change lanes and respond to traffic signals on city streets.\n\nThe judge had recommended that regulators suspend Tesla’s license to sell cars for 30 days, but the regulators gave the company a 90-day window to make changes. They decided it had done that sufficiently to fix the deceptive marketing.\n\nThe reprieve from the California DMV comes as Tesla and other electric vehicle makers grapple with a plunge in demand after the expiration of key tax credits that had boosted sales. Musk has switched the company’s focus toward robotaxis equipped with self-driving technology, as well as humanoid robots.",

    "fullText": "China didn't just celebrate Lunar New Year this week. It staged a robotics flex.\n\nAt the annual Spring Festival Gala, the Lunar New Year show in China, humanoid robots from Chinese startup Unitree Robotics flipped, lunged, and swung swords and nunchucks just feet from child performers in a tightly choreographed kung fu routine.\n\nIn one sequence inspired by \"drunken boxing,\" a traditional Chinese martial arts style, the robots staggered, fell backward, then rose again — showcasing advances in control and coordination.\n\nClips circulating online quickly drew comparisons to last year's broadcast, which featured Unitree humanoid robots performing a Chinese folk dance. The choreography then was noticeably simpler.\n\nThe gala, often likened to the US Super Bowl for its massive audience, also featured other Chinese robotics firms, including MagicLab, Galbot, and Noetix, in separate segments throughout the broadcast on Monday evening.\n\nReactions on Chinese social media showed viewers being struck by how quickly the technology has advanced.\n\nOn RedNote, a user who goes by Ma Xiao said in a video posted on Wednesday that during last year's performance, the robots were only \"doing very simple things.\"\n\n\"Now, they're doing kung fu, they're doing flips, they're doing synchronized dancing,\" he said. \"Everybody's shocked.\"\n\n\"Now the rest of the world knows what China's speed is,\" he added.\n\nAnother RedNote user, DKKD, posted a video of friends reacting to the performance on Tuesday, captioning it: \"Three Americans were scared by the Spring Festival robot.\"\n\n\"They were all shocked by the robot's level of evolution (including me),\" the user wrote.\n\nOne viewer in the video can be heard saying: \"It's way more impressive than last year. It's crazy.\"\n\nUnitree CEO Wang Xingxing said in an interview with Chinese media following the gala that the company expects to ship up to 20,000 humanoid robots this year, up from about 5,500 in 2025.\n\nGlobal shipments of humanoid robots could reach \"tens of thousands\" this year, with Unitree potentially contributing between 10,000 and 20,000 units, Wang said on Tuesday.\n\nChinese companies developing humanoid robots and autonomous systems are racing to outdo global rivals.\n\nIn September, Ant Group, an affiliate of Alibaba Group, unveiled R1, a humanoid robot that drew comparisons to Tesla's Optimus. Two months later, EV and robotics maker XPeng introduced the latest version of its humanoid, Iron, which the company described as \"highly human-like.\"\n\nChina's elite universities are also moving to build talent for the sector. In November, China's Ministry of Education issued a notice stating that top institutions are preparing to launch a new undergraduate major in \"embodied intelligence,\" a field that combines AI with robotics.\n\nStill, China's rapid push into robotics hasn't been seamless.\n\nXPeng's Iron fell face-first during its first public appearance in China earlier this year. Its CEO, He Xiaopeng, later wrote on Chinese social media that the mishap was part of \"learning to walk.\"\n\nLast month, a Unitree humanoid kicked an engineer in the groin during a test. Humanoid robots stumbled and fell while racing against humans in a half-marathon in Beijing in April last year.",

He argued that the era of “static” tools—where businesses must bend their workflows to fit a software's limitations—is rapidly ending.\n\n\"Software is dead because everything's going to be customized to your unique utilization,\" Cuban stated, citing a shift where AI models mold themselves around specific business needs in real time.\n\nThis AI Helps Fortune 1000 Brands Avoid Costly Ad Mistakes — See Why Investors Are Paying Attention\n\nOwn the Characters, Not Just the Content: Inside a Fast-Growing Pre-IPO IP Company\n\nHe noted that even industry titans like Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) are recognizing this shift toward “unique usage” over general-purpose platforms.\n\nThe ETFs tracking the software stocks in the U.S. have underperformed so far in 2026. iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (BATS:IGV) dropped 19.34%, and State Street SPDR S&P Software & Services ETF (NYSE:XSW) declined 17.56%.\n\nMark Cuban just pronounced software dead, and the implications will destroy industries before most people understand what happened.\n\nCuban: \"Software is dead because everything's going to be customized to your unique utilization.\"\n\nRigid SaaS dies.

    "fullText": "Australia experienced a boom in smart-home technology at the start of the 2020s. Years on, some early adopters are experiencing buyer’s remorse\n\nGet our weekend culture and lifestyle email\n\nWhen the smart home devices Elly Bailey was expecting in the post never showed up at her Gold Coast home, she was frustrated. As a technology reviewer, these products were crucial for her work.\n\nWhen she eventually found the cause, she had to laugh. It wasn’t a sticky-fingered neighbour or a rogue delivery driver causing her to miss parcels, but her smart doorbell – the very thing she’d hoped would prevent missed deliveries, and part of exactly the range of internet-connected devices she was meant to be reviewing.\n\n“It’s pretty funny,” says Bailey, 33, who goes by the handle @ellyawesome on TikTok, where she has more than 1.1 million followers. She’d been loving her Google Nest doorbell up until then. She could see who was at the front door from upstairs and speak to delivery people through her phone while she was out.\n\nBut it had one obvious flaw: “When someone presses this doorbell, all it does is send a notification to my phone.” She says this feature is “great” when she’s out, but without a telltale chime she was missing deliveries while at home and away from her phone. She complained about this to her followers in a clip that’s been liked more than 1,400 times.\n\n“The crazy irony is the doorbell itself does make a little ding-dong sound when you press the doorbell button, but it’s only loud enough for the person at the door to hear it,” she says.\n\nBailey is far from alone in her scepticism around smart home technology – many adoptees have realised the devices designed to make life easier regularly achieve the opposite. Stories of people being locked out of their homes by faulty smart locks, woken up by pets activating cameras on the driveway, and being left in the dark by broken smart lights are rife on social media and product review websites.\n\n“Technology is brilliant … until it isn’t,” says Georgina Wilson, an architect in Sydney who learned this the hard way when her husband pressure-hosed the front of the house and accidentally watered their smart keypad unit. The incident hasn’t changed her mind on the convenience of a smart lock, but it did result in an expensive emergency locksmith callout – and quickly forced her to put a backup plan in place: keys in a hidden lockbox, with copies distributed to family members and neighbours.\n\nShe says some of her clients have had similar, or worse, experiences. “We’ve seen clients unable to flush toilets, lock front doors, or exit garages during power outages.”\n\nSince smart home technology uptake spiked during Covid lockdowns, Daniel Vasilevski, an electrician in Sydney, says he’s seen many smart tech horror stories. One client in Maroubra got locked out of their house for two days. Others have ended up with no working lights. Subscription complaints are also rife, with even some relatively simple devices like smart doorbells and thermostats requiring monthly fees. Vasilevski estimates 15 to 20% of his callouts these days are for problems with smart tech – some are simple repair jobs, while others want their smart systems demolished altogether.\n\nThere can be a more sinister side, too. Experts say smart homes are prime targets for cybercriminals. More than 120,000 smart home cameras were hacked in South Korea last year and the Australian Signals Directorate recently warned that Chinese hackers are exploiting people’s home routers and smart devices.\n\nWhile cases of spying fridges and doorbells being hacked are still rare, Emily Holyoake, a cyber and home-security expert based in Canberra, says technology facilitated domestic abuse is a significant issue.\n\n“The scariest things I’ve heard are about loss of privacy, where ex-partners have still had access to their partner’s home and made changes either locking them out, letting themselves in or watching their every move,” she says.\n\nRenters, too, have privacy concerns, as smart locks can allow landlords to keep tabs on their every move.\n\nJulie Provenzano, a real estate broker with 83,000 TikTok followers, believes it might be smarter to stick with an analogue home. She recently told fans she was “apped-out”. “Hi-tech doesn’t necessarily mean easier … It leaves people in a hostage situation with IT departments,” she said.\n\nVasilevski’s clients have faced similar issues. When something goes wrong, it’s not just the tech that’s a problem, but finding someone to fix it. Many locksmiths are not trained to work with sophisticated, connected devices. He says electricians will sometimes turn away smart home repair jobs because of how faffy and time-consuming they can be to troubleshoot. “It isn’t worth the hassle, most of the time,” he says. This is particularly true with lower-end smart tech suppliers who offer little in the way of after-sale support.\n\nGaby Albutros, a project manager at Sydney firm RSE Home Automation, says that when brands shut down or devices are discontinued, as was the case with Belkin’s Wemo smart home range in January, customers can be left high and dry.“The only option when they go wrong is to have them ripped out.”\n\nCurtains and blinds seem to be among the few smart-control devices that experts in the industry agree upon. Provenzano says they’re one of the only smart devices she endorses, and Vasilevski agrees, saying he wouldn’t install smart tech in his home because of the issues he sees at work, but that “smart control curtains are pretty reliable because they only get used twice a day”.\n\nWhile Holyoake doesn’t suggest eschewing the Internet of Things entirely, she says the key is to be intentional about the technology you’re putting in your home. In her household, she uses smart security cameras, lighting, a robot vacuum and even a digital whiteboard – all things she says make family life easier, especially with neurodivergent kids.\n\nMindful of the risks, she suggests smart-home adopters make time to check their security settings once a month. “Make sure only the people you know and trust have access, always make sure you change the default password, check for security and software updates, and always ask: who has access to my data and where is it stored? Do I need a subscription to access my own data? Can I still access devices if the internet goes out?”\n\nBailey might be a likely champion for all things smart, but even she prefers a hybrid setup. She’s been offered everything from smart lights to smart washing machines as part of her job, so she could have the world’s most connected home if she wanted to, but aside from the smart doorbell – which she’s kept because she still thinks the benefits outweigh the drawbacks – she’s chosen to keep most parts of her home “consciously dumb”.\n\n“Ultimately I’m an old-school millennial who’s very happy to put my washing on myself,” she says. “I think that keeps me smart, to be honest.”",

    "title": "Ukraine's drone war showed the West it needs to view small drones less like prized gear and more like expendable ammo",
    "description": "Western militaries often view new technology as precious and valuable. Ukraine shows that they can't afford to view small drones that way.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine's large-scale drone war is pushing Western militaries to treat small drones less as high-end equipment and more as expendable ammunition that isn't meant to come back.\n\nUS Army and British Army officials, as well as a NATO veteran who volunteered to fight in Ukraine, told Business Insider that effective drone warfare requires sending large numbers forward — and accepting many will be lost as a routine cost.\n\nMaj. Rachel Martin, the director of the US Army's new drone lethality course, told Business Insider that the conflict shows that \"if you're going to flood the zone with drones,\" especially in a combat situation where electronic warfare is heavy, \"you're going to lose a lot of drones.\"\n\nShe said it's a \"transition from the army of old,\" where a lost drone was \"a significant emotional event\" that was reported to senior leadership. In Ukraine, it's different. \"Drones go down all the time.\" There, losses are typically shrugged off, rather than investigated.\n\nThat shifting mindset is shaping how Western militaries train.\n\nLt. Col. Ben Irwin-Clark, the commanding officer of the British Army's 1st Battalion of the Irish Guards, told Business Insider that his battalion has changed its training to allow drones to be damaged or even destroyed to reflect battlefield realities. \"I absolutely think they need to be disposable because otherwise you're not training realistically,\" he said.\n\nJakub Jajcay, a former special forces member from Slovakia who fought in Ukraine, told Business Insider that if NATO militaries want to start using drones for real missions, they \"need to get used to the fact that they're basically expendable material more akin to ammunition or fuel or gasoline, things like that, rather than specialized high-end pieces of equipment that need to be looked after.\"\n\nHe said when he was serving in the military for his home country, \"drones were very specialized pieces of equipment.\"\n\nThe drones were fairly expensive, he shared, \"and there was always a sort of bureaucratic process\" in using them. Sometimes, only designated individuals were allowed to use the drones.\n\nIf something happened to a drone, \"that would've been a big problem in training. If we had lost a drone, somebody would've been in big trouble for that.\" The war in Ukraine shows how poorly that peacetime mindset fits large-scale combat.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has featured drones on an unprecedented scale. Ukraine says roughly 80% of its strikes are carried out using drones rather than other weapons. Many never reach their targets and are lost along the way, though.\n\nCheap drones worth several hundred dollars have destroyed weaponry worth millions. But many of them don't have any effect. A report last year from the UK's Royal United Services Institute said that \"between 60 and 80% of Ukrainian FPVs fail to reach their target, depending on the part of the front and the skill of the operators.\"\n\nSome drones are jammed or disrupted by electronic warfare, while others are shot down or get their cables cut. Sometimes they're knocked out by soldiers on their own side.\n\nMany of the drones on the battlefield are single-use, designed to explode when they hit their target, but many of them are destroyed, damaged, or disabled before they even reach that point.\n\nJajcay said that even drones designed to be used again and again \"have a lifespan of maybe a few dozen missions at most.\"\n\nHe also said that drones failed \"all the time,\" and those losses were expected.\n\nThe US Army is recognizing and learning from these dynamics in Ukraine, as are other Western militaries, as they incorporate the idea that drones cannot be treated as overly precious assets into their drone warfare training and doctrine.\n\nMaj. Wolf Amacker, who leads the Army's Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Tactics Branch at the Aviation Center of Excellence, told Business Insider that out of the thousands of drones used daily, only around 30% of them hit their targets, while many others don't have a significant impact on their targets.\n\nThe Army is learning that lots of drones need to be sent forward.\n\nIrwin-Clark told Business Insider that the way the UK sees drones has also shifted. He said \"every time there's an iterative change in technology in the battlefield, everyone gets very excited about it and the ownership of that asset tends to be far too high.\"\n\nHe said that often when a new and powerful technology emerges, senior leaders will try to tightly control it, arguing that because there are only a handful available, only a select few should have the authority to decide when it's used. The assets are carefully protected, at least initially. Later on, trust is imparted to soldiers to handle technology previously in the charge of higher-ups.\n\nThat pattern, Irwin-Clark said, is \"exactly what's happening with drones.\"\n\nHis battalion wrapped the first drones it received years ago in bubble wrap, \"and we didn't fly them very often,\" he said. \"When we did,\" he continued, \"we made sure we flew in the middle of a field with nothing, no obstacles around.\"\n\nNow, his battalion is deliberately crashing its latest drone delivery into targets, while looking at how to make repairs. \"It really doesn't matter if we break them,\" Irwin-Clark said.\n\nThe US is coming at it the same way. Martin, who previously commanded a Gray Eagle drone company, said her course takes into account that \"drones crash. I'll say that to the day I die having owned drones as a commander: drones crash.\"\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said last year that the defense department needs to view small drones as consumables rather than \"durable property\" — more like ammunition than valuable equipment. It's a change that Jajcay described as \"a step in the right direction.\"\n\nWestern armies were using various drones in warfare before Russia's invasion, often using them as surveillance platforms or tools for launching missile strikes. Small drones weren't used the way they're being used in Ukraine, but the US, UK, and others are learning drone lessons from the war.\n\nMartin said the ongoing conflict in Ukraine shows that even when you lose drones, it's ultimately \"still cheaper than employing missiles on specific targets.\" That's an equation the US Army can't totally ignore.\n\n\"They're cheaper, and you're not putting human lives in danger\" to carry out the mission, she shared. And the Army knows that \"they're going to crash. It's going to happen.\"",

    "fullText": "Microsoft says it is on track to invest $50 billion by the end of the decade to help bring artificial intelligence to lower-income countries, as concerns mount over the technology’s potential to deepen inequality.\n\nThe announcement was made Wednesday at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, where leading tech executives, government officials and AI researchers are debating how to use AI to solve real-world problems.\n\nPolicymakers globally are increasingly worried that the unequal adoption of AI risks widening income and development gaps between rich and poor countries. In December, the United Nations Development Project called for global cooperation on standards and safety to ensure the technology “functions as a shared public good rather than a concentrated advantage.”\n\nAt the summit, Microsoft likewise expressed the need for cross-border partnerships to prevent poorer countries from being left behind.\n\n“We need to act with urgency to address the growing AI divide,” Microsoft president Brad Smith and chief responsible AI officer Natasha Crampton said in a joint statement. “Artificial intelligence is diffusing at an impressive speed, but its adoption around the world remains profoundly uneven.”\n\nThe company’s $50 billion commitment to developing economies by 2030 compares with the roughly $80 billion that Microsoft invested into data centers last year alone, more than half of which was directed to a single economy: the United States.\n\nA recent Microsoft report found that AI usage in the global north, a catch-all term for developed and high-income countries, is roughly twice that of the global south — and growing.\n\n“This disparity impacts not only national and regional economic growth, but whether AI can deliver on its broader promise of expanding opportunity and prosperity around the world,” Smith and Crampton said.\n\nThey warned that, just as unequal access to electricity has exacerbated a growing economic gap between the global north and south, without urgent action, the AI divide could perpetuate that disparity in the century ahead.\n\nOn the other hand, the technology could be used positively to help poor countries leapfrog older development pathways. “If AI is deployed broadly and used well by a young and growing population, it offers a real prospect for catch-up economic growth for the Global South,” said Smith and Crampton.\n\n“It might even provide the biggest such opportunity of the 21st century,” the pair said.\n\nMicrosoft’s $50 billion investment will, among other things, help to build the data centers crucial to providing the computing power needed to run AI models. Extending internet access is another focus.\n\nOnly about 36% of Africa’s population had broadband internet access in 2022, according to the World Bank. That compares with some 90% of US households, official figures show.\n\nThe AI Impact Summit, hosted by India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, highlights the country’s ambition to position itself as an AI leader in the global south.\n\nHigh-profile attendees include Sam Altman of OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Google CEO Sundar Pichai who is due to deliver a keynote address on Friday.",

    "description": "The SaaSpocalypse fears are overblown. AI's integration into enterprise software may boost, not harm, established SaaS companies.",
    "fullText": "The recent AI-inspired software meltdown is an enormous overreaction. SaaS companies are going to do just fine. In fact, they might see their businesses boom as a result of AI.\n\nAfter working for decades in the IT and cloud sectors, I know what it takes to build, sell, and maintain complex enterprise software. And it's clear to me that AI is not the threat that many investors fear.\n\nLet's look at the three main concerns that the market is obsessing over. All of them have shortcomings that will keep established SaaS vendors doing well.\n\nSoftware development has been transformed by AI. It's a near-perfect use case for generative AI: applying established patterns to a well-bounded use case, resulting in incredible productivity improvements.\n\nThis coding revolution has led some commentators to predict that companies are going to write their own software, rather than buy it from SaaS vendors.\n\nThis makes me wonder if these commentators have ever actually spent any time working in enterprise IT. Even if one accepts that software creation is much easier now, bringing a full software product to market requires much more than code:\n\nGeoffrey Moore, a renowned management consultant and organizational theorist, wrote a book called \"Crossing the Chasm\" on what mainstream enterprises need to adopt new technology. He never mentioned the cost of writing software code as a gating factor.\n\nOver the course of my long career, I have witnessed countless DIY failures by enterprise IT organizations that fail to understand the difference between an internal software project and a real product. I can already see another wave of failures, fueled by misplaced AI coding enthusiasm.\n\nAI prognosticators see cheaper startups displacing large software incumbents. This overlooks the reality that established SaaS providers already have smaller, cheaper competitors yet somehow remain dominant. The challenges for new entrants to a software sector include:\n\nIt's incredibly difficult for a small startup to displace an incumbent vendor. As Clayton Christensen observed in \"The Innovators Dilemma,\" innovative startups usually begin by solving use cases incumbent vendors are unable or unwilling to serve.\n\nLeft unaddressed in this scenario is why incumbents wouldn't just use AI themselves to improve engineering efficiency to address any price pressure from smaller new rivals.\n\nThis is the idea that AI model companies will extend their nascent software products into vertical offerings, thereby killing off incumbent vendors.\n\nOpenAI made a big splash with a healthcare initiative, for example. Anthropic caused a bunch of software stocks to drop with its plugins.\n\nIt's understandable why these companies launched these initiatives. Many industry-specific software companies are highly profitable, so AI labs would love to get a piece of this business.\n\nPursuing this, while working on other initiatives, could spread AI labs too thin, though. Startups often fail due to a lack of focus, and this is especially apropos for AI model makers. They face enormous, unprecedented opportunity, and getting distracted by bright, shiny vertical SaaS offerings is a terrible idea.\n\nGoing back to the DIY section above, there's huge complexity and cost to shipping and maintaining real enterprise software. Now multiple this by all the various industry verticals that exist, such as healthcare, financial services, and manufacturing. Addressing the idiosyncratic requirements of each sector would require huge numbers of employees, along with management time and attention. The model makers are already growing at breakneck speed; trying to add enough people to become vertical software providers would be a Sisyphean task.\n\nIf I were advising these boards, I would argue for focus: win the horizontal AI model layer in what is likely to become a small oligopoly.\n\nAnd yes, expand AI coding capabilities that lower the cost of development and increase the global population of software creators. That dynamic could trigger Jevons Paradox — cheaper software leading to vastly more of it — enriching the model providers without forcing them into every software vertical.\n\nThe SaaSpocalypse will, in retrospect, come to be thought of like the Beanie Babies mania: a short-lived phenomena that now seems inexplicable to comprehend.\n\nBernard Golden is CEO of Navica, a Silicon Valley-based technology analysis, consulting, and investment firm.",

    "fullText": "Prof Michael Wooldridge says scenario such as deadly self-driving car update or AI hack could destroy global interest\n\nThe race to get artificial intelligence to market has raised the risk of a Hindenburg-style disaster that shatters global confidence in the technology, a leading researcher has warned.\n\nMichael Wooldridge, a professor of AI at Oxford University, said the danger arose from the immense commercial pressures that technology firms were under to release new AI tools, with companies desperate to win customers before the products’ capabilities and potential flaws are fully understood.\n\nThe surge in AI chatbots with guardrails that are easily bypassed showed how commercial incentives were prioritised over more cautious development and safety testing, he said.\n\n“It’s the classic technology scenario,” he said. “You’ve got a technology that’s very, very promising, but not as rigorously tested as you would like it to be, and the commercial pressure behind it is unbearable.”\n\nWooldridge, who will deliver the Royal Society’s Michael Faraday prize lecture on Wednesday evening, titled “This is not the AI we were promised”, said a Hindenburg moment was “very plausible” as companies rushed to deploy more advanced AI tools.\n\nThe Hindenburg, a 245-metre airship that made round trips across the Atlantic, was preparing to land in New Jersey in 1937 when it burst into flames, killing 36 crew, passengers and ground staff. The inferno was caused by a spark that ignited the 200,000 cubic metres of hydrogen that kept the airship aloft.\n\n“The Hindenburg disaster destroyed global interest in airships; it was a dead technology from that point on, and a similar moment is a real risk for AI,” Wooldridge said. Because AI is embedded in so many systems, a major incident could strike almost any sector.\n\nThe scenarios Wooldridge imagines include a deadly software update for self-driving cars, an AI-powered hack that grounds global airlines, or a Barings bank-style collapse of a major company, triggered by AI doing something stupid. “These are very, very plausible scenarios,” he said. “There are all sorts of ways AI could very publicly go wrong.”\n\nDespite the concerns, Wooldridge said he did not intend to attack modern AI. His starting point is the gap between what researchers expected and what has emerged. Many experts anticipated AI that computed solutions to problems and provided answers that were sound and complete. “Contemporary AI is neither sound nor complete: it’s very, very approximate,” he said.\n\nThis arises because large language models, which underpin today’s AI chatbots, rattle out answers by predicting the next word, or part of a word, based on probability distributions learned in training. It leads to AIs with jagged capabilities: incredibly effective at some tasks, yet terrible at others.\n\nThe problem, Wooldridge said, was that AI chatbots failed in unpredictable ways and had no idea when they were wrong, but were designed to provide confident answers regardless. When delivered in human-like and sycophantic responses, the answers could easily mislead people, he added. The risk is that people start treating AIs as if they were human. In a 2025 survey by the Center for Democracy and Technology, nearly a third of students reported that they or a friend had had a romantic relationship with an AI.\n\n“Companies want to present AIs in a very human-like way, but I think that is a very dangerous path to take,” Wooldridge said. “We need to understand that these are just glorified spreadsheets, they are tools and nothing more than that.”\n\nWooldridge sees positives in the kind of AI depicted in the early years of Star Trek. In one 1968 episode, The Day of the Dove, Mr Spock quizzes the Enterprise’s computer only to be told in a distinctly non-human voice that it has insufficient data to answer. “That’s not what we get. We get an overconfident AI that says: yes, here’s the answer,” he said. “Maybe we need AIs to talk to us in the voice of the Star Trek computer. You would never believe it was a human being.”",

    "fullText": "Google, Anthropic and OpenAI bosses to mingle with global south leaders wrestling for control over technology\n\nSilicon Valley tech billionaires will land in Delhi this week for an AI summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, where leaders of the global south will wrestle for control over the fast-developing technology.\n\nDuring the week-long AI Impact Summit, attended by thousands of tech executives, government officials and AI safety experts, tech companies valued at trillions of dollars will rub along with leaders of countries such as Kenya and Indonesia, where average wages dip well below $1,000 a month.\n\nAmid a push to speed up AI adoption across the globe, Sundar Pichai, Sam Altman and Dario Amodei, the heads of Google, OpenAI and Anthropic, will all be there. Rishi Sunak and George Osborne, a former British prime minister and a former chancellor, will each be pushing for greater adoption of AI. Sunak has taken jobs for Microsoft and Anthropic and Osborne leads OpenAI’s push to deepen and widen the use of ChatGPT beyond its existing 800 million users.\n\nMeanwhile Modi, who will address the summit on Thursday, is positioning India as the AI hub for south Asia and Africa. On the agenda will be AI’s potential to transform agriculture, water supplies and public health. Governments in Kenya, Senegal, Mauritius, Togo, Indonesia and Egypt will send ministers.\n\nModi’s enthusiasm for AI has a darker side, civil liberties campaigners say. Last week they raised serious concerns about India deploying AI to increase state surveillance, discriminate against minorities and sway elections. But Modi this week spoke of “harnessing artificial intelligence for human-centric progress” and India has given the summit the strapline: “Welfare for all, happiness for all.”\n\nSummit observers talk of a battle between a new kind of AI colonialism from the US tech firms and an alternative “techno-Gandhism”, in which AI is used for social justice and to benefit marginalised people. After global AI summits in the UK, Korea and France, the Delhi meeting is the first to be held in the global south.\n\nIndian commentators say the test of AI’s value is not in its technical sophistication but whether it can improve the lives of people living in some of the toughest circumstances in the global south. By contrast, US AI companies are racing for supremacy, competing with each other and China, and rolling out AI for shopping, personal companionship and agentic systems that could slash corporate labour costs by making white-collar jobs redundant.\n\nIf a referee between the two sides is needed, António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations, will speak in Delhi. This week he said it would be “totally unacceptable that AI would be just a privilege of the most developed countries or a division only between two superpowers”.\n\nIndia’s AI Impact Summit is the fourth iteration of the event, which Sunak launched in 2023 at Bletchley Park in the UK, with a focus on international coordination to prevent catastrophic risks from the most advanced AI models. Summits followed in Seoul in 2024 and Paris in 2025, where the US vice-president, JD Vance, appeared to abandon the White House’s interest in safety saying: “The AI future will not be won by hand-wringing about safety; it will be won by building.”\n\nSafety is once again on the agenda, with Yoshua Bengio, one of the “godfathers” of AI, on hand to repeat his fears about the risk of powerful AI systems enabling cyber- and bioweapons attacks.\n\n“The capabilities of AI have continued to advance, and although mitigation and risk management of AI has also progressed [it has happened] not as quickly,” he said on Tuesday. “So it becomes urgent that leaders of this world understand where we could be going and it needs their attention and intervention as soon as possible.”\n\nOne of those working at the summit to make sure AI remains safe will be Nicolas Miaihle, co-founder of the AI Safety Connect group, who noted that the summit was taking place in the shadow of AI-enabled warfare in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\n“The existential risks are not going anywhere,” he told the Guardian. “When Rishi Sunak started this, the race was not raging as hard. The trillions are pouring in but we are very far away from securing these models. This is profound for democracy, profound for the mental health of our kids and profound for warfare.”\n\nBut the Trump administration continues its policy of refusing to bind US AI companies with red tape. The White House is not expected to send a high-level representative to Delhi, with Sriram Krishnan, its senior AI policy adviser, the highest-ranked speaker listed in the programme.\n\n“Given where we are with the US administration it’s pretty unlikely you’re going to have a massive breakthrough on any consensus on what a regulatory framework will look like,” said one senior AI company source.\n\nCompanies such as Google are focused on the use of AI in education in India, where large language models’ ability to function in many of the country’s dozens of languages is an advantage.\n\n“[There’s] a big focus on access and adoption, how can you make sure that the technology is available as broadly as possible,” said Owen Larter, head of frontier AI policy and public affairs at Google DeepMind. “We’re excited on the education front in India. It’s a remarkable story of an incredibly intense adoption. About 90% of teachers and students already using AI in their learning. We’ve had a big promotional programme where 2 million students have access to our pro subscription for free.”\n\nGoogle’s investments in India include a $15bn spend, in partnership with the conglomerate of Gautam Adani, one of India’s richest billionaires, on an gigawatt-scale AI datacentre hub in the coastal city of Visakhapatnam, in Andhra Pradesh, with subsea cables connecting to other parts of the world.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: ICE more than tripled the amount of data stored in Microsoft’s cloud at the same time that its arsenal of surveillance technology ballooned\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deepened its reliance on Microsoft’s cloud technology last year as the agency ramped up arrest and deportation operations, leaked documents reveal.\n\nICE more than tripled the amount of data it stored in Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform in the six months leading up to January 2026, a period in which the agency’s budget swelled and its workforce rapidly expanded, according to the files.\n\nICE appears to be using a range of Microsoft’s productivity tools, as well as AI-driven products, to search and analyse the data it holds in Azure. Files suggest some of the agency’s own tools and systems may also be running on Microsoft servers.\n\nThe documents – obtained by the Guardian and its partners +972 Magazine and Local Call – raise questions about whether Microsoft technology is facilitating an immigration crackdown by an agency accused of conducting unlawful operations and using excessive force on a large scale.\n\nICE enforcement operations have surged over the past year as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign. The agency is now at the centre of a battle in Congress over its funding, sparked by the deaths of two people in Minneapolis, that has led to a partial shutdown of the US government.\n\nIn July, ICE received a $75bn budget increase, making it the highest-funded US law enforcement body. With this unprecedented increase in funds, the agency has embarked on a spending spree on technology, awarding contracts to large firms such as Palantir alongside lesser-known providers.\n\nICE, which has been likened to a domestic surveillance agency, enjoys access to vast troves of data on people living in the US. It has a growing arsenal of surveillance technology, including facial recognition apps, phone location databases, drones and invasive spyware.\n\nAs the agency expanded through 2025, it boosted spending on cloud computing. Amazon and Microsoft, both longtime providers to ICE and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), have emerged as beneficiaries of deals worth tens of millions of dollars struck by third-party resellers.\n\nThe leaked documents do not specify the kinds of information stored by ICE on Microsoft servers. However, they indicate the agency has used Azure services including “blob storage” of raw data, as well as AI tools that analyse images and videos, and translate text.\n\nIn January, according to the files, ICE held almost 1,400 terabytes in Azure, which if only comprised of photographs would be equivalent to approximately 490m images. This was up from 400 terabytes in July 2025 after climbing through the second half of last year, files suggest.\n\nICE is also using virtual machines on Azure, according to the documents. These are effectively computers that run in the cloud but that can be accessed remotely. ICE appears to be renting these high-powered computers to run software.\n\nThe agency, which has more than doubled its workforce since January 2025, is also understood to have significantly expanded its access to Microsoft’s suite of productivity apps which provide users with access to document management tools and an AI chatbot.\n\nIt’s unclear from the files whether ICE is using Azure to store or analyse information collected through any of its surveillance or intelligence gathering activities, or whether the cloud platform supports other functions, such as the running of detention centres or deportation flights. ICE did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA spokesperson for Microsoft said it “provides cloud-based productivity and collaboration tools to DHS and ICE, delivered through our key partners”. They said Microsoft’s policies and terms of service “do not allow our technology to be used for the mass surveillance of civilians, and we do not believe ICE is engaged in such activity”.\n\nThe spokesperson added: “There are currently many public issues relating to immigration enforcement, and we believe Congress, the executive branch, and the courts have the opportunity to draw clear legal lines regarding the allowable use of emerging technologies by law enforcement.”\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The company later appeared to narrow this position. It acknowledged to employees it had contracts with ICE and DHS, but said it “does not presently maintain AI services contracts tied specifically to enforcement activities”.\n\nMicrosoft is not alone in facing disquiet among employees over its business with federal immigration authorities. For large US tech groups, ICE and sister agency Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have long been customers, but have become increasingly controversial for their aggressive tactics and involvement in fatal shootings.\n\nLast week, Amazon workers and activists protested outside the company’s Seattle headquarters, demanding the company cut ties with federal immigration agencies. The company benefits from a series of large cloud deals with DHS to provide cloud infrastructure to ICE and CBP.\n\nAt Google, which provides cloud services to both agencies, more than 1,300 workers have signed a recent petition with a similar set of demands. “DHS is violating civil and national law as well as civil and human rights,” the petition reads. “We must end our complicity in powering them.”\n\nBeyond the headlines: inside stories from the Guardian’s investigations team.

    "title": "Why an A.I. Video of Tom Cruise Battling Brad Pitt Spooked Hollywood",
    "description": "A 15-second clip created by an artificial intelligence tool owned by the Chinese technology company ByteDance appears more cinematic than anything so far.",
    "fullText": "It took only a 15-second clip of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt duking it out on a crumbling rooftop at twilight to draw swift outrage, and sizable fear, from Hollywood over the last few days.\n\nThe widely circulated video was created by the Irish director Ruairi Robinson using Seedance 2.0, a powerful artificial intelligence video generation tool owned by the Chinese technology company ByteDance. It had plenty of the bells and whistles of a big-budget Hollywood film: sweeping camera angles, stunt choreography, crisp sound effects and haunting music.\n\nWith a two-sentence prompt and the click of a button, Seedance had produced a stunningly realistic result that was a drastic improvement over previously generated artificial intelligence videos, often shoddy clips known as A.I. slop. This video was so convincing that it drew near immediate condemnation from some of Hollywood’s top organizations and companies.\n\nRhett Reese, a scriptwriter known for his “Deadpool” films, said in an interview that the Cruise-Pitt video had sent a “cold shiver” up his spine.\n\n“For all of us who work in the industry and devoted our careers and lives to it, I just think it’s nothing short of terrifying,” he said. “I could just see it costing jobs all over the place.”\n\nByteDance released Seedance 2.0 last week, nearly two months after a previous version had failed to prompt much anger. A news release from the company praised the updated tool’s “physical accuracy, realism and controllability,” which it said was suitable for the needs of “professional-grade creative scenarios.”\n\n“The creation process,” the release went on, “is more natural and efficient, allowing users to control their creations like a true ‘director.’”\n\nUsers promptly flocked to the platform to spin up their own content. An alternate ending to “Game of Thrones” went viral, as did a video of the notoriously beefing rappers Kendrick Lamar and Drake burying the hatchet on “The Tonight Show,” and one of Samara Morgan, the vengeful girl in “The Ring” horror films, emerging from an old television set to pet a cat.\n\nRobinson himself posted additional videos, including of Pitt and Cruise battling a robot, and of Pitt sparring with a sword-wielding “zombie ninja.”\n\nAt the same time, Hollywood was swift to sit up straight. Charles Rivkin, the chairman and chief executive of the Motion Picture Association, called on ByteDance to “immediately cease its infringing activity,” saying in a statement that Seedance 2.0 had engaged in the unauthorized use of copyrighted works on a “massive scale.” Human Artistry Campaign, a global coalition that advocates using A.I. “with respect for the irreplaceable artists, performers and creatives,” said on social media that unauthorized works generated by Seedance 2.0 violated the “most basic aspects of personal autonomy.”\n\nDisney, which in a watershed $1 billion deal last year agreed to allow OpenAI’s Sora users to generate video content with its characters, sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance, accusing it of supplying Seedance with a “pirated library” of Disney’s characters — “as if Disney’s coveted intellectual property were free public-domain clip art.”\n\nByteDance, which also owns TikTok and has been valued at $480 billion in the private markets, said in a statement that it respected intellectual property rights and was aware of the concerns about Seedance.\n\n“We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorized use of intellectual property and likeness by users,” the statement said.\n\nAs last year’s deal between Disney and OpenAI suggests, Hollywood has for years wrestled with how to manage the rapid growth of generative artificial intelligence. The concerns outlined by Reese echoed the Writers Guild strike in 2023, when for months thousands of union members demanded that studios institute guardrails protecting them from having their jobs or their intellectual property stolen by A.I. In the end, the group won guarantees that A.I. would not encroach on writers’ credits and compensation.\n\nDuncan Crabtree-Ireland, the national executive director and chief negotiator of SAG-AFTRA, which represents actors and media artists, said its contracts had specific and enforceable rules about digital replication. The kind of material represented by the Cruise-Pitt battle, he said, “could not be produced by any of the signatories to our contracts — the studios, the streamers — without the specific, informed consent of those individuals.”\n\nAccording to Crabtree-Ireland, the real concern is that, even if videos generated by Seedance and other A.I. platforms “are not malicious in intent,” they could “really violate someone’s right to control how their image, their likeness and their voice is used.”\n\nNot everyone is awed by Seedance’s latest technology. Heather Anne Campbell, an executive producer and a writer on the animated series “Rick and Morty,” said her social media accounts last week had been inundated with Seedance-generated clips of anime, sci-fi and unlikely superhero battles. But she is not yet worried, she said, about losing her job to the technology.\n\n“Everybody is, I think, swept up by the circus that came to town and is showing off,” she said. “I haven’t seen anything good yet. Nothing that has taken my breath away, nothing that is poignant, nothing that is provocative even. It’s all just garbage.”\n\nCampbell added that A.I. services like Seedance were at best “averaging machines,” and argued that the greatest art was never made quickly or impersonally.\n\nStill, some people working in Hollywood find it difficult to imagine that studios will not come to see A.I. as a cost-saving shortcut. “It would be cheaper to have A.I. write a screenplay than it would be for me to write a screenplay,” Reese, the “Deadpool” writer, said. “I just know that in the back of my mind, that’s where the terror comes from.”\n\nFor Reese, a long-term answer to the unease that A.I. will reorder Hollywood could not come quickly enough.\n\n“If I could wave my magic wand and make A.I. go away, at least in the creative field,” he said, “I would absolutely wave the wand.”",

    "fullText": "Industry using ‘diversionary’ tactics, says analyst, as energy-hungry complex functions such as video generation and deep research proliferate\n\nTech companies are conflating traditional artificial intelligence with generative AI when claiming the energy-hungry technology could help avert climate breakdown, according to a report.\n\nMost claims that AI can help avert climate breakdown refer to machine learning and not the energy-hungry chatbots and image generation tools driving the sector’s explosive growth of gas-guzzling datacentres, the analysis of 154 statements found.\n\nThe research, commissioned by nonprofits including Beyond Fossil Fuels and Climate Action Against Disinformation, did not find a single example where popular tools such as Google’s Gemini or Microsoft’s Copilot were leading to a “material, verifiable, and substantial” reduction in planet-heating emissions.\n\nKetan Joshi, an energy analyst and author of the report, said the industry’s tactics were “diversionary” and relied on tried and tested methods that amount to “greenwashing”.\n\nHe likened it to fossil fuel companies advertising their modest investments in solar panels and overstating the potential of carbon capture.\n\n“These technologies only avoid a minuscule fraction of emissions relative to the massive emissions of their core business,” said Joshi. “Big tech took that approach and upgraded and expanded it.”\n\nMost of the claims that were scrutinised came from an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, which was reviewed by leading tech companies, and corporate reports from Google and Microsoft.\n\nThe IEA report – which devoted two chapters to the potential climate benefits of traditional AI – had a roughly even split between claims that rested on academic publications, corporate websites and those that had no evidence, according to the analysis. For Google and Microsoft, most claims lacked evidence.\n\nThe analysis, released during the AI Impact Summit in Delhi this week, argues the tech industry has misleadingly presented climate solutions and carbon pollution as a package deal by “muddling” types of AI.\n\nSasha Luccioni, AI and climate lead at Hugging Face, an open-source AI platform and community, who was not involved in the report, said it added nuance to a debate that often lumped very different applications together.\n\n“When we talk about AI that’s relatively bad for the planet, it’s mostly generative AI and large language models,” said Luccioni, who has pushed the industry to be more transparent about its carbon footprint.\n\n“When we talk about AI that’s ‘good’ for the planet, it’s often predictive models, extractive models, or old-school AI models.”\n\nGreen claims even for traditional AI tended to rely on weak forms of evidence that had not been independently verified, the analysis found. Only 26% of the green claims that were studied cited published academic research, while 36% did not cite evidence at all.\n\nOne of the earliest examples identified in the report was a widespread claim that AI could help mitigate 5-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.\n\nThe figure, which Google repeated as recently as April last year, came from a report it commissioned from BCG, a consulting firm, which cited a blogpost it wrote in 2021 that attributed the figure to its “experience with clients”.\n\nDatacentres consume just 1% of the world’s electricity but their share of US electricity is projected to more than double to 8.6% by 2035, according to BloombergNEF. The IEA predicts they will account for at least 20% of the rich world’s growth in electricity demand to the end of the decade.\n\nWhile the energy consumption of a simple text query to a large language model such as ChatGPT may be as little as running a lightbulb for a minute, partial industry disclosures suggest, it rises considerably for complex functions such as video generation and deep research, and has troubled some energy researchers with the speed and scale of its growth.\n\nA spokesperson for Google said: “Our estimated emissions reductions are based on a robust substantiation process grounded in the best available science, and we have transparently shared the principles and methodology that guide it.”\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment, while the IEA did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nJoshi said the discourse around AI’s climate benefits needed to be “brought back to reality”.\n\n“The false coupling of a big problem and a small solution serves as a distraction from the very preventable harms being done through unrestricted datacentre expansion,” he said.",

    "description": "A hierarchy of simplicity for every layer of the stack. Flask over Django, HTML over React, bare server over Kubernetes, small models over the latest GPT. And when each one actually earns its complexity.",
    "fullText": "2026-02-14 · engineering, architecture, opinion, simplicity, ai\n\nThere's a mass delusion in software engineering that more tools equals more capability. That if Netflix uses Kubernetes, you should too. That if Facebook built React, your three-page marketing site needs it. That the \"modern stack\" is modern for a reason, and choosing anything simpler means you're behind.\n\nIt's nonsense. Most of the time, the simplest tool that solves your problem is the right tool. Not the most popular one. Not the one with the best conference talks. The one with the fewest moving parts.\n\nHere's how I think about technology choices, layer by layer.\n\nIf you're building an API, start with FastAPI or Flask. One file. A few routes. You can read the entire application in ten minutes. There's no ORM you didn't ask for, no admin panel you'll never use, no middleware stack you need to understand before you can return JSON.\n\nDjango is a different tool for a different problem. It's an application framework, not a microframework. It makes decisions for you: how your database models work, how authentication works, how your admin interface looks. If you're building a product with user accounts, permissions, a database-backed admin panel, and you have a team of five or more, Django saves you months. It's opinionated in ways that keep large teams from making inconsistent choices.\n\nThe mistake is reaching for Django when you need three endpoints and a database query. You'll spend more time learning what Django wants than building what you want.\n\nSpring is the same idea taken further. Enterprise teams, compliance requirements, complex service meshes. If you're at a bank with 200 engineers and a mandate to use Java, Spring is genuinely good at what it does. If you're two people building a SaaS, it'll bury you.\n\nThe rule: Pick the framework whose complexity matches your problem's complexity. If you can describe your backend in one sentence, you probably need a one-file framework.\n\nThis is where the industry has lost its mind the most.\n\nPlain HTML with some CSS works for an astonishing number of things. This site you're reading is static HTML. No JavaScript framework. No build step. No node_modules folder with 800 packages. I write Markdown, a Python script generates HTML, and Nginx serves it. It loads in under a second on any connection.\n\nWhen you need interactivity, HTMX is a revelation. It lets you add dynamic behavior by writing HTML attributes instead of JavaScript. Need a button that loads content without a page refresh? One attribute. Need a form that submits asynchronously? One attribute. You keep writing HTML and your server keeps rendering HTML. No JSON APIs, no client-side state management, no hydration bugs.\n\nSvelte sits in a similar sweet spot. It compiles to vanilla JavaScript. No virtual DOM. No runtime library. The output is small and fast. If you need more interactivity than HTMX gives you but don't want the overhead of a full SPA framework, Svelte is excellent.\n\nReact makes sense when you're building a genuinely complex, stateful application. Think Figma. Think Google Docs. Think Notion. Applications where the UI has hundreds of independent state changes, where components need to communicate across deep trees, where you need a component ecosystem because you're building something too large for one team to own entirely.\n\nThe problem is that people use React for everything. Landing pages. Blogs. Documentation sites. Marketing pages. I've seen teams spend three sprints setting up Next.js for a site that could have been twenty HTML files. The framework overhead, the build pipeline, the SSR complexity, the hydration issues. All of it unnecessary. All of it actively making the product worse by making it slower and harder to maintain.\n\nI run this site on a Raspberry Pi behind Nginx. The deploy script is 40 lines of bash. rsync copies files, Nginx serves them. If the Pi dies, I buy a new one for $50 and rsync again. Total infrastructure cost: about 5 watts of electricity. Twelve months in, it's still running.\n\nFor most small projects and early-stage products, a single server with systemd services is all you need. You SSH in. You know what's running. You can read the logs. When something breaks, you fix it directly. There's one machine, one set of logs, one reality to debug.\n\nDocker containers make sense when you need reproducible environments. When your app has dependencies that conflict with other things on the same machine. When you need to hand off a project and say \"run docker compose up and it works.\" When you're deploying the same service across staging and production and need them to be identical. Containers solve real problems.\n\nBut Docker adds a layer. Now you're debugging things inside a container that works differently than your local machine. Now your logs are in a different place. Now you need to understand volumes, networks, build caches. Every layer you add is a layer you need to understand when things go wrong.\n\nKubernetes makes sense at scale. When you have dozens of services, when you need automated scaling, when you need rolling deployments with zero downtime across multiple regions. When you have a platform team whose full-time job is managing infrastructure. Google built Kubernetes because Google has Google-sized problems.\n\nIf you're three engineers running a SaaS with a few thousand users, Kubernetes is not solving your problem. It's replacing your problem with a harder problem. You'll spend more time writing YAML manifests and debugging pod scheduling than building your product.\n\nI've watched startups with five engineers spend months setting up Kubernetes clusters. The CTO wanted it on the resume. The engineers wanted to learn it. The product needed a VPS and a Postgres database. They could have shipped in a week and scaled later. Instead they built infrastructure for a million users while they had twelve.\n\nSQLite is the most underrated database in existence. It's a single file. No server process. No connection management. No port configuration. It handles more concurrent reads than most apps will ever need. If your data fits on one machine and you don't need concurrent writes from multiple processes, SQLite is fast, reliable, and effectively zero maintenance.\n\nPostgres is the right choice for most production applications. It's battle-tested, well-documented, and handles basically everything. JSON columns, full-text search, geospatial queries, pub/sub. Before you reach for Redis, Elasticsearch, or any other specialized database, check if Postgres can already do what you need. It usually can.\n\nDistributed databases (CockroachDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB) solve problems that 99% of applications don't have. If you need writes across multiple regions with single-digit millisecond latency, sure. If you need to handle millions of writes per second, sure. If you're building a CRUD app with a few thousand users, a single Postgres instance on a $20/month VPS will serve you for years.\n\nThis is the one closest to home because I build tools around this exact principle at NehmeAI Labs.\n\nThe default instinct right now is to throw the biggest frontier model at every problem. Summarization? Frontier model. Classification? Frontier model. Extracting a date from an email? Frontier model. It's the Kubernetes of AI: massively capable, massively overkill for most tasks.\n\nA 4B parameter model trained on a specific task will outperform a 400B general model on that task. Not sometimes. Reliably. FlashCheck is a 4B model that detects hallucinations in RAG pipelines. It scores 91.7% on RAGTruth. It beats Llama 405B on this specific task while using 100x less compute. Not because small models are magic, but because a focused model doesn't waste capacity on things it doesn't need to know.\n\nThe same logic applies to inference costs. Most teams routing everything through their most expensive model are sending simple prompts to a frontier model because they never measured whether a cheaper one could handle it. RightSize exists to answer exactly that question: it evaluates your real prompt traffic and finds where smaller, cheaper models are sufficient. Typical savings are 50-100x. Not because the quality drops. Because most prompts don't need the most powerful model available.\n\nThis maps directly to the philosophy of this entire post. Your inference costs are a design choice, not a fact of life. You don't start with the biggest model and optimize later. You start with the smallest model that works and scale up only where the task demands it.\n\nThe pattern is always the same. Start simple. Measure. Add complexity only where the data tells you to.\n\nI'm not arguing that simple is always right. I'm arguing that it's the right default. You should start simple and add complexity when you feel the pain, not before.\n\nHere's when you genuinely need the heavier tools:\n\nLarge teams. Django's opinions prevent 50 engineers from making 50 different architectural choices. React's component model lets teams work on the same frontend without stepping on each other. Kubernetes lets a platform team provide self-service infrastructure to dozens of product teams. The overhead pays for itself through coordination.\n\nCompliance and enterprise. Banks, healthcare, government. When you need audit trails, role-based access at every layer, and the ability to prove exactly what ran in production six months ago. Spring Boot's security stack and Kubernetes' declarative infrastructure make compliance audits possible at scale.\n\nGenuine scale. When your SQLite file would be terabytes. When your single server can't handle the traffic. When you actually have the users and the load that demand distributed systems. The key word is \"actually.\" Not \"projected.\" Not \"hoped for.\" Actually. And when you do migrate, be honest that it's a rewrite, not a simple upgrade.\n\nComplex client-side applications. If your users spend hours in your app doing complex, stateful work (design tools, collaborative editors, data dashboards), React or similar frameworks earn their complexity budget.\n\nEvery tool you add is a tool you need to:\n\nA three-person startup using Kubernetes, React, GraphQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, and Terraform has the operational complexity of a 50-person engineering org without the people to manage it. They'll spend 70% of their time on infrastructure and 30% on the product. That ratio should be inverted.\n\nThe best engineers I know aren't the ones who use the most tools. They're the ones who use the fewest tools that solve the problem. They resist the urge to optimize for problems they don't have. They ship with boring technology and save the interesting technology for when it's actually needed.\n\nSimple isn't a limitation. It's a discipline. And the debugging is a lot easier when there are fewer layers to dig through.",

    "description": "\"Nobody truly knows who the long-term winners and losers of this extraordinary technology will be,\" Deutsche's Jim Reid wrote this morning.",
    "fullText": "Investors wobbled last week as they worked through the disruption AI is likely to cause across global industries, with further hiccups potentially bubbling through this week. But the reckoning should have been expected, argued Deutsche Bank in a note to clients this morning, because it is a readjustment of perhaps overly optimistic expectations.\n\nSoftware stocks in particular suffered a wipeout amid mounting concerns that large language models may replace current service offerings. Companies in the legal, IT, consulting and logistics sectors were also impacted. JP Morgan wrote last week that some $2 trillion had been wiped off software market caps alone as a result, a reality that prior to a fortnight ago, Deutsche’s Jim Reid argued had been purely academic. \n\nA 13-figure sell-off is something Reid has speculated over for some time, telling clients: “For months, my published view has been that nobody truly knows who the long term winners and losers of this extraordinary technology will be. Yet as recently as October, markets were implicitly pricing in a world where almost every tech company would come out a winner.\n\nWhy did software stocks suffer major selloffs recently?\n\nWhat caused the $2 trillion market cap wipeout?\n\nWhat makes AI disruption different from past cycles?\n\nHow are experts viewing current AI stock valuations?\n\n“Over recent weeks we’ve seen a more realistic differentiation emerge within tech—but that repricing is now rippling into the broader economy with surprising speed.”\n\nReid hasn’t been alone in his suspicion that investors had perhaps been painting over the entire stock market (and indeed wider economy) with the same, optimistic brush. Some speculators have made broad-stroke arguments that the efficiencies offered by AI will result in wins for the vast majority of companies, while others have argued that while AI is not in a bubble, there are pockets of overoptimism that may burst. \n\nJPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon is of such an opinion, explaining at the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit last year: “You should be using it,” (speaking to any business that was listening). But he added a caveat, saying that back in 1996, “the internet was real,” and “you could look at the whole thing like it was a bubble.” Then he broke down the real difference that he sees—between AI, on the one hand, and generative AI, on the other. It’s an important distinction, Dimon said, while adding that “some asset prices are high, in some form of bubble territory.”\n\nIndeed, Jeremy Siegel, Emeritus Professor of Finance at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, argued that such shifts demonstrate investors are “asking the right questions.” Writing for WisdomTree a week ago, where he serves as senior economist, Siegel said: “When companies talk about $200 billion in capital expenditures, markets should scrutinize payback periods, competitive dynamics, and whether durable moats can be built in an environment where technology is evolving at breakneck speed. That tension explains why leadership will continue to rotate even as the secular story remains intact.” \n\nThat said, Reid suggested that the market may be repricing overzealously, arguing the disruption in “old economy” sectors feels overdone: “The real challenge is that even by the end of this year, we still won’t have enough evidence to identify the structural winners and losers with confidence. That leaves plenty of room for investors’ imaginations—both optimistic and pessimistic—to run wild. As such big sentiment swings will continue to be the order of the day.”",

    "description": "HILL AIR FORCE BASE, Utah, Feb 15 - The U.S.",
    "fullText": "HILL AIR FORCE BASE, Utah, Feb 15 - The U.S. Departments of Energy and Defense on Sunday for the first time transported a small nuclear reactor on a cargo plane from California to Utah to ‌demonstrate the potential to quickly deploy nuclear power for military and civilian use.\n\nThe agencies partnered with California-based Valar Atomics to ‌fly one of the company’s Ward microreactors on a C-17 aircraft — without nuclear fuel — to Hill Air Force Base in Utah. Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Under ​Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Michael Duffey were on the C-17 flight with the reactor and its components, and hailed the event as a breakthrough for U.S. nuclear energy and military logistics.\n\n“This gets us closer to deploy nuclear power when and where it is needed to give our nation’s warfighters the tools to win in battle,” Duffey said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration sees small nuclear reactors as one ‌of several ways to expand U.S. energy production. Trump ⁠last May issued four executive orders aimed at boosting domestic nuclear deployment to meet growing demand for energy for national security and competitive AI advancements.\n\nThe Energy Department in December issued two grants to help ⁠accelerate development of small modular reactors.\n\nProponents of microreactors also have touted them as energy sources that can be sent to far-flung and remote places, offering an alternative to diesel generators which require frequent deliveries of fuel. But skeptics have argued that the industry has not proven that small ​nuclear reactors ​can generate power for a reasonable price.\n\n\"There is no business case for ​microreactors, which — even if they work as designed — will ‌produce electricity at a far higher cost than large nuclear reactors, not to mention renewables like wind or solar,\" said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\nThe Energy Department plans to have three microreactors reach “criticality” — when a nuclear reaction can sustain itself — by July 4, Wright said.\n\nThe microreactor in Sunday's event, a little larger than a minivan, can generate up to 5 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 5,000 homes, according to Valar CEO Isaiah Taylor. It will start operating in July ‌at 100 kilowatts and peak at 250 kilowatts this year before ramping up ​to full capacity, he said.\n\nValar hopes to start selling power on a test ​basis in 2027 and become fully commercial in 2028. ​Although private industry funds its own development of nuclear technology, it also needs the federal government “doing some ‌enabling actions to allow fuel fabrication here and uranium ​enrichment here,” he said.\n\nFuel for Valar's ​reactor will be transported from the Nevada National Security site to the San Rafael facility, Wright told reporters.\n\nHowever, even small generators result in a significant amount of radioactive waste, Lyman said. Other experts have said designers are not compelled to ​consider waste at inception, beyond a plan for ‌how it will be managed.\n\nAlthough disposal of nuclear waste remains an unresolved issue, the Energy Department is in talks ​with a few states, including Utah, to host sites that could reprocess fuel or handle permanent disposal, Wright ​said.",

    "description": "Prime minister says outcomes of consultation on social media ban should be implemented quickly as technology minister says Australia-style ban is not inevitable\nIn his Q&A with journalists, Keir Starmer was also asked to respond to a report by the BBC’s James Landale saying he is looking at plans to raise defence spending to 3% of GDP by the end of this parliament. In the past Starmer has just said that he would like to do this at some point in the next parliament.\nIn his reply, Starmer said that at the Munich Security Conference over the weekend he was arguing that the UK, and Europe as a whole, needs to “step up”.\nWe want a just and lasting peace, but that will not extinguish the Russian threat, and we need to be alert to that, because that’s going to affect every single person in this room, every single person in this country, so we need to step up.\nThat means, on defence spending, we need to go faster.",
    "fullText": "At his event this morning Keir Starmer made it clear that the laws on how teens access social media will definitely be tightened. But he said he was “open-minded” about whether this would include a full, Austalian-style ban.\n\nStarmer suggested that one option will be to limit the technology that allows “doomscrolling”. He said:\n\nWe’ve taken the powers to make sure we can act within months, not years.\n\nWe also need to act very quickly, not just of the age concern, but on the devices and applications that make the sort of auto-scrolling, the constant glueing to the machine that you can never stop scrolling.\n\nIn a post on his Substack account, Starmer said out in more details the options that could be implemented as a result of the consultation being carried out. He said:\n\nWe will be going to parliament for new government powers, enabling us to act on the findings of the social media consultation where the evidence suggests we need to. This could include:\n\n-Setting a minimum age limit for social media: unlike the Tories, who took years to pass the Online Safety Act, we will take powers that would allow us to implement a minimum age for social media in a matter of months to prevent kids from accessing harmful social media.\n\n-Restricting specific functionalities: that are detrimental to kids’ wellbeing and keep them hooked to their screens like endless scroll or autoplay\n\n-Limiting VPN access for kids: to make it harder for kids to get around age limits of services or certain functionalities.\n\nThis is all designed to put the wellbeing of children first.",

    "description": "After a weekend of FA Cup action without VAR, BBC Sport ask managers, fans and pundits whether the game needs technology - and what needs to change.",
    "fullText": "Would football be better without the video assistant referee (VAR) system?\n\nPremier League fans, managers and players got a reminder of what life was like without VAR in the FA Cup fourth round - and it is fair to say this weekend was not without its problems.\n\nFor this season and the previous FA Cup campaign, VAR has not been brought in until the fifth round, with many fans looking forward to a return to football without interruptions from technology.\n\nAfter a season full of controversy, delayed decisions and confusion fuelled by VAR, its very existence has been questioned at times, with many claiming the game would be better without it.\n\nIn fact, after a day full of long delays, mixed messages and irate managers in early February, ex-Tottenham midfielder Danny Murphy told BBC Match of the Day: \"For the good of the game, you'd have VAR gone.\n\n\"The problem is what it is doing to the games, to the spectacle, with the amount of time it takes to get there.\n\n\"Do you want more right decisions or do you want a more free-flowing football experience that is genuine and spur of the moment?\"\n\nAfter a couple of offside goals being allowed, a blatant penalty not being awarded plus various other controversial decisions, the weekend certainly brought the subject back into the public eye.\n\nLong delays, irate managers and mixed messages - is VAR bad for game?\n\n'The officials looked petrified' - was Villa Park chaos advert for VAR?\n\nWhy is there no VAR in the FA Cup third and fourth round?\n\nWe have all heard the arguments against VAR.\n\nDecisions taking too long, celebrations being put on hold while deliberations take place, confusion as goals are given - or ruled out - for marginal reasons, denying referees the ability to use their own common sense.\n\nBut Newcastle's controversial 3-1 win at Aston Villa on Saturday could hardly have gone better for supporters of VAR - or worse for those who argue football is better without it.\n\nTammy Abraham's opener was clearly offside, Villa's full-back Lucas Digne inexplicably escaped conceding a penalty for handball and the Frenchman could easily have been dismissed for a reckless challenge as well.\n\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe said: \"I'm so torn because the game is better without VAR in terms of excitement and the spectacle for the supporters and us when we're living a moment live.\n\n\"But it does give accurate results. It does make the game more precise in terms of decision making. You have to respect those moments. They're worth their weight in gold, especially us today when we were on the wrong side of it.\"\n\nAston Villa manager Unai Emery went further, saying \"VAR is necessary. It's necessary to help the referees\".\n\nThere was also some controversy at Anfield during Liverpool's 3-0 win over Brighton.\n\nSubstitute Rio Ngumoha, 17, had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside for the hosts, while the Seagulls were furious Mohamed Salah was awarded a penalty.\n\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot said: \"In general, I enjoy watching football without VAR because if you then score you're like 'it's a goal'.\n\n\"I like VAR only for the clear and obvious things - I'm not meaning a red card yes or no for Marc Guehi on Mo Salah because I thought it was.\n\n\"So let's stay away from that and only go to offside yes or no, ball over the line yes or no and, for the rest, the referee referees the game.\n\n\"I think we're now so used to VAR that I would prefer to have VAR during a game.\"\n\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola was unsure whether football was better with VAR, despite seeing Omar Marmoush denied a goal for a debatable offside in his side's 3-0 win against Salford.\n\n\"Sometimes before I thought it was better and sometimes I think VAR helps us to have a more fair game,\" he said. \"To be honest I don't know.\"\n\nFor some though, it is simple - rather than VAR being a solution for wrong decisions, they would argue officials just need to get things right.\n\nWhen asked on Match of the Day Live whether the errors at Villa Park put him in favour of VAR, ex-Newcastle striker Alan Shearer, said: \"No. I would like the officials to do their job properly. It is not too much to ask, is it?\n\n\"If you ever needed any evidence of the damage that VAR has done to referees, I think Saturday is a great example of that.\n\n\"These guys look petrified to make a decision because they didn't have a comfort blanket.\n\n\"For me, [referees' decisions] are actually getting worse.\"\n\nFormer Newcastle and Aston Villa goalkeeper Shay Given added on Match of the Day: \"It shows you why we use VAR. A lot of decisions the officials got wrong at Villa Park. VAR is like a comfort blanket for referees.\n\n\"The decision is taken away from the officials. The linesman has been told all season not to put their flag up, so their brain has been trained. I think it shows VAR is a help even though we complain about it most weeks.\"\n\nWhen asked whether football had become too reliant on VAR, Howe had some sympathy with the argument.\n\n\"There is an argument to say yes,\" he said. \"Because when VAR is there, there is a tendency to think 'oh well I won't give that because VAR is there to check it'.\n\n\"Then your decision making isn't as sharp as it would normally have to be. Maybe there is a difference there. I would probably say you are right in that respect.\"\n\nBut former referee Graham Scott feels it is unfair to claim officials hide behind VAR.\n\n\"I really don't think that's fair,\" he said on the Wayne Rooney Show.\n\n\"Obviously I work with them closely and I know these guys and they're not like that. It's not how their minds work, not how their processes work.\n\n\"I spent half my career with VAR and half without it - the other way around of course, without it first.\n\n\"And then when I was in the Premier League I was still dropping into the Championship quite often. So you're in and out, in and out. And your processes essentially stay the same.\n\n\"What has changed though is with VAR you don't have that spell in a game where you know you've made a really big error and you now have to reset and go again.\"\n\nJames: Football without VAR is real football. Having gone to games for the last 30 years, the last few years have been terrible in comparison. I don't bother cheering goals any more as the officials are far more interested in finding ways of disallowing goals than the entertainment of the match-going fan.\n\nVAR will be the thing that makes me turn in my season ticket, and if West Ham do get relegated the lack of VAR will be a blessing.\n\nFrank: I supported the introduction of VAR, but it was great not having it today. It wouldn't be so bad if there weren't so many VAR ridiculous errors.\n\nAlan: Much, much better [without]. VAR has ruined the game, thankfully I now support non-league football where there are humans, making human mistakes and getting it right.\n\nStephen: Much better without VAR. No waiting for obvious incidents that everyone can see immediately but takes VAR forever to decide. Time for return of refs and linesman to start refereeing the game again.\n\nMike: Better, even though City probably had a goal chalked off incorrectly. Right or wrong, its so much better to just know immediately if its a goal or not. VAR is a moment-killer.\n\nLes: The game is so much better without VAR. It flows without problem like it used to do. The officials are there to make decisions rightly or wrongly. VAR are always making wrong calls so I can't see the point of it. Offside because someone's toes are on the lines drawn is absolutely pathetic.\n\nBonnie: As a Villa and VAR fan, that is exactly the decision that VAR doesn't get credit for. VAR gets it right 100%\n\nRoger: That was so blatantly offside, have linesman lost their natural ability to spot stuff like this since the introduction of VAR? Whenever you see a defence hold their line like Newcastle did, strikers are more often than not offside. Poor decision.\n\nPeter: There's an easy fix for VAR offsides. If you can watch one TV replay and see the on-field decision is clearly wrong, you intervene.\n\nStephen: That's what you all wanted isn't it? More goals regardless of whether they're actually fair or not?\n\nLiga: It's these types of situations and these types of situation only where VAR should and needs to be used for offsides. Not those hairline millimetre is he on or off line drawing nonsense situations.\n\nCallum: This season is proving 2 things. 1) VAR is a must. 2) Brave, high pressure attacking football is dead.\n\nBen: What are linesman for exactly? Having no VAR is a another shambles, who makes these decisions?\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "A marginal VAR offside decision caused a fair amount of controversy for Newcastle in midweek. Joe Willock had a goal disallowed at Tottenham when the semi-automated technology said his forehead was offside.\n\nAbraham's goal was the kind of decision the video review was brought in for - the real howlers.\n\nThe Villa striker was clearly ahead of the defence when Douglas Luiz played the free-kick. With VAR, the goal would have been ruled out.\n\nIt would be easy to blame switching between systems as a defence for the assistant, Nick Greenhalgh. But with or without VAR, he would be expected to raise his flag if he's identified an offside.\n\nShould Digne have been sent off?\n\nWould the VAR have stepped in to show a red card to Digne for serious foul play with his late challenge on Jacob Murphy? It is far from certain from what we have seen in the Premier League.\n\nWe often hear the VAR has referenced glancing contact to uphold the decison of a yellow card. See Diogo Dalot's challenge on Jeremy Doku in the Manchester derby last month.\n\nDigne did come in at some speed and that would have increased the chance of being sent off on review.\n\nYet the Frenchman did not push through on to the shin of the Newcastle player. That his foot came off quickly probably would have saved him.\n\nIt may well have been one of those where the on-field decision would have stood, whether it was yellow or red card.\n\nSerious foul play or denying an obvious goalscoring opportunity (Dogso)?\n\nReally, this incident could have been either. After all, Bizot brought down Murphy with a knee-high challenge - although it was not with studs leading.\n\nWhen the Dutch goalkeeper fouled the Newcastle forward, the Magpies were left with three attackers up against only Luiz, although Dogso could only be applied to the player fouled.\n\nThe VAR would have taken into account the general run of the ball was not towards goal. They would also consider if Luiz would have been able to get across to prevent the shot.\n\nYou can make a case for a degree of doubt for Dogso. But much like the Digne decision it is one which would likely have stayed with the on-field decision.\n\nRead more analysis on the officiating in Aston Villa v Newcastle here",

    "fullText": "Maker of chatbot with coding ability says annualised revenue grew tenfold in each of past three years, to $14bn\n\nAnthropic, the US AI startup behind the Claude chatbot, has raised $30bn (£22bn) in a funding round that more than doubled its valuation to $380bn.\n\nThe company’s previous funding round in September achieved a value of $183bn, with further improvements in the technology since then spurring even greater investor interest.\n\nThe fundraising was announced amid a series of stock market moves against industries that face disruption from the latest models, including software, trucking and logistics, wealth management and commercial property services.\n\nThe funding round, led by the Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and the hedge fund Coatue Management, is among the largest private fundraising deals on record.\n\n“Anthropic is the clear category leader in enterprise AI,” said Choo Yong Cheen, the chief investment officer of private equity at GIC.\n\nAnthropic said its annualised revenue – an estimate of full-year sales based on recent company data – had reached $14bn, having grown more than tenfold in each of the past three years. A significant driver of recent growth has been Claude Code, the company’s AI-powered coding tool that became generally available in May 2025.\n\nAnthropic’s rival OpenAI, backed by Microsoft and SoftBank, has been assembling what is reportedly a far larger round of up to $100bn that would value the ChatGPT developer at about $830bn.\n\nThe staggering sums being raised reflect equally staggering burn rates, with the companies spending cash to cover their huge costs of computing and attracting researcher talent.\n\nAnthropic has forecast reducing its cash burn to roughly a third of revenue in 2026 and just 9% by 2027, with a break-even target of 2028 – two years ahead of its rival, according to reports. Both companies are widely expected to pursue initial public offerings in the second half of 2026.\n\nThe rapid valuation increases for leading AI startups such as Anthropic and OpenAI, whose price tags far exceed those of many of the US’s largest listed companies, has alarmed some observers. Last year, a leading British tech investor, James Anderson, said he found sharp increases in valuations of companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic “disconcerting”.\n\nSome listed firms at the forefront of the AI industry have also come under stock market pressure in recent days.\n\nShares in Alphabet, Google’s parent company, have fallen by 4.2% so far this week, indicating some investors are still spooked by the big AI-related spending plans it laid out this month. Meta has declined by 1.7% during this week. Shares in Nvidia, a leading chipmaker and key provider of AI infrastructure, dropped by 1.6% on Thursday amid a wider sell-off but have been flat on the week.\n\n“A gloomy session on Wall Street on Thursday put investors in a grumpy mood at the end of the trading week,” said Russ Mould, the investment director at investment platform AJ Bell.\n\n“Association with AI has gone from party to peril as investors reappraise what the technology means for companies. \n\n “Some are concerned about excessive levels of spending and others fear AI will disrupt multiple industries. It all adds up to a cocktail of worries and that’s bad for market sentiment more broadly,” Mould added.\n\nFounded in 2021 by the siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, both former executives at OpenAI, Anthropic has positioned itself as a safety-focused alternative in the AI race.\n\nThe funding round also comes shortly after Anthropic’s first television commercials were broadcast during Super Bowl LX, using the campaign to emphasise that its products remain ad-free. The ads took an apparent jab at OpenAI, which has begun to introduce advertising into the free version of ChatGPT.\n\nAnthropic’s earlier backers include Amazon, which has invested $8bn and serves as a primary computing partner through its datacentres, as well as Google, which invested $2bn in 2023.\n\nAgence France-Presse contributed to this article",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: in 2025 briefing to Wes Streeting, officials warned reputation of tech firm behind US ICE operations would hinder rollout of data system in UK\n\nHealth officials fear Palantir’s reputation will hinder the delivery of a “vital” £330m NHS contract, according to briefings seen by the Guardian, sparking fresh calls for the deal to be scrapped.\n\nIn 2023, ministers selected Palantir, a US surveillance technology company that also works for the Israeli military and Donald Trump’s ICE operation, to build an AI-enabled data platform to connect disparate health information across the NHS.\n\nNow it has emerged that after Keir Starmer demanded faster deployment, Whitehall officials privately warned that the public perception of Palantir would limit its rollout, meaning the contract would not offer value for money.\n\nPalantir was this week called “ghastly” and “a highly questionable organisation” by MPs in the House of Commons.\n\nThe fallout over Peter Mandelson’s relationship to the convicted child sexual abuse offender Jeffrey Epstein has also affected the image of Palantir, which employed the former US ambassador’s lobbying company, Global Counsel.\n\nBefore he was sacked, Mandelson took Starmer to meet Palantir’s chief executive, Alex Karp, at the tech company’s Washington showroom.\n\nMPs last week demanded greater transparency around Palantir’s public sector deals, which also include a £240m contract with the Ministry of Defence and with several police forces.\n\nIn a private briefing for Wes Streeting before a meeting with Palantir’s European boss, Louis Mosley, in June 2025, Department of Health officials wrote: “The public perception of the [Federated Data Platform (FDP)] during the procurement, and then in delivery, has been affected by the profile of Palantir.\n\n“We do not know the extent to which this is impacting on delivery. It is, however, likely to make it harder to go further with the FDP, and to encourage the inclusion of GP data locally.”\n\nThe briefing was released under the Freedom of Information Act to Foxglove, a tech fairness campaign group.\n\nThe officials said the rollout had also been affected by debates about patient privacy and concerns that the NHS was being “locked-in” to a single vendor, but added: “Many of these debates are inaccurate and are often as a result of misconceptions.”\n\nDonald Campbell, director of advocacy at Foxglove, said: “The prime minister and the health secretary should listen to the public they serve when they tell them Palantir has no place in the NHS.\n\n“They should not be scheming with tech billionaires’ staff on how best they can ‘mitigate’ the ‘public perception’ problems these tech giants deservedly face through their own repellent behaviour.”\n\nThe BMA, which represents NHS doctors, said it has “long opposed the involvement of Palantir in the delivery of care and the use of patient data in our NHS, and it is concerning to see from this briefing that the government felt public concern about Palantir should be dismissed as ‘misconceptions’”.\n\nThe briefing document suggested Streeting could ask Palantir how to speed up the rollout, and say that the government was keen to “remove unnecessary obstacles” including by revisiting “regulations relating to confidential patient information”.\n\nStreeting on Monday sought to show he had “nothing to hide” regarding his relationship with Mandelson by publishing their WhatsApp messages between August 2024 and October 2025.\n\nNone mentioned Palantir, although in one exchange just over three weeks after Streeting’s meeting with the company, Mandelson encouraged him to visit the US and said: “Need to plan. Lots of tech companies and people to talk to.”\n\nNew figures released on Thursday showed that the number of NHS organisations using the Palantir technology has increased since June from 118 to 151, which is still well short of the target of 240 by the end of this year.\n\nPalantir was co-founded by the Trump supporter and billionaire Peter Thiel, who has previously said “the NHS makes people sick”, and described the British public’s affection for the NHS as a case of “Stockholm syndrome” – the term for hostages who feel a bond with their captors.\n\nThe former Conservative government minister David Davis said the government now faced a “huge value-for-money issue” over the Palantir contract.\n\nHe said there had been “naivety in the senior management of the NHS” in awarding a contract to a company with “spectacular baggage in terms of its genesis in the American security state”.\n\n“The government is going to have a problem with many hospital trusts and they are going to have really difficult problems with the GPs,” he said. “My best estimate is they will never get most of the GPs with an organisation like Palantir.”\n\nJohn Puntis, co-chair of the Keep Our NHS Public campaign, said: “This looks like another example of a hugely wasteful IT contract, and lack of public trust will make it unworkable.\n\n“They ought to end the contract or not renew it. They should accept that the public is very concerned and it is going to make the use of public data very difficult if people think it’s going to be accessed by a company like Palantir.”\n\nA spokesperson for Palantir said: “Palantir software is helping to deliver better public services in the UK. That includes delivering 99,000 more NHS operations and reducing hospital discharge delays by 15%, as well as helping the Royal Navy keep ships at sea for longer and the police to tackle domestic violence.”\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The Federated Data Platform is already delivering for the NHS – helping to join-up patient care, increase hospital productivity, speed up cancer diagnosis and ensure thousands of additional patients can be treated each month.\n\n“All providers go through a rigorous, competitive procurement process in line with Government legislation. All data operates under the instruction of the NHS, with strict stipulations in the contract about confidentiality.”\n\nNHS England declined to comment.",

    "description": "AI's next phase will shift from Nvidia and cloud leaders to large incumbent companies adopting the technology to boost profits and cut costs.",
    "fullText": "Investors are growing jittery about a potential bubble in artificial intelligence stocks, but the real payoff may be just beginning — and it could extend well beyond Silicon Valley's usual winners, a $19 billion hedge fund investor said.\n\n\"This is a generational platform shift. We are in probably the third or fourth inning of the actual build out,\" David Craver, the co-chief investment officer of Lone Pine Capital, said on Goldman Sachs' \"Exchanges\" podcast published Thursday.\n\nCraver added that while he understands concerns surrounding the vast sums of money being spent on AI, the underlying signals — improving models, tight capacity, and real-world business impact — suggest the cycle still has room to run.\n\nHe points to three signals that keep him bullish on AI infrastructure.\n\nFirst, the models are still improving as more computing power is thrown at them. \"They are absolutely getting better,\" and have more uses, he said.\n\nSecond, demand continues to outstrip supply as hyperscalers and inference providers still lack sufficient capacity, he said.\n\nThird — and most important — companies are already seeing dramatic returns from deploying AI internally.\n\nHe said founders and digital-first CEOs are describing \"mind-blowing\" productivity gains, from automated coding to replacing manual workflows with AI agents.\n\n\"We have had numerous CEOs say to us, 'I think I can triple or more the revenues in my business. And I'm never going to have to hire another human being,'\" Craver said.\n\nStill, not every company is seeing those kinds of returns on investment. According to PwC's latest Global CEO Survey, released last month, 56% of the 4,454 chief executives surveyed said AI has yet to deliver revenue or cost benefits for their businesses.\n\nEarly AI gains have gone primarily to infrastructure leaders like Nvidia and cloud providers. Craver thinks the next phase will be defined by adoption across large, incumbent companies.\n\n\"I have a theme that I call 'revenge of the dinosaurs,' which is, larger companies are going to adopt this technology and take cost out of their business in a huge way over the next two and three and four years,\" he said.\n\nHe said the impact would show up clearly in corporate earnings.\n\n\"I think we're going to get on conference calls in 2027, and CFOs are going to say, 'I just took half a billion dollars out of my spending on an annual basis because we're implementing this new technology,'\" he said.\n\nThat dynamic, in his view, is \"super bullish for the market.\"\n\nCraver's comments come at a fragile moment for AI-linked stocks, as investors grow more nervous after a blistering multi-year run.\n\nThis week, software stocks sold off as investors weighed the disruptive impact of AI against concerns about elevated valuations, aggressive capital spending, and whether the buildout has outpaced fundamentals.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of insurance brokerages, wealth managers, and real estate services firms — sectors seen as exposed to AI disruption — have fallen sharply.\n\nDespite the volatility, Craver said Lone Pine remains \"quite bullish on that overall bet\" on AI.\n\n\"It's not a bubble when everybody thinks it's a bubble,\" he said. \"It's going to be a bubble when we get to the other side of this.\"",

    "title": "MLB owners crack down on pitch stealing with new rule aimed at first- and third-base coaches",
    "description": "Pitch stealing is allowed as long as players and coaches don't use in-game technology to steal signs.",
    "fullText": "MLB owners want to make it harder for teams to engage in pitch-stealing tactics on the field. Team owners reportedly voted to approve a rule Thursday that would prevent first- and third-base coaches from leaving their coaches' boxes on the field until after a pitcher throws a pitch, according to ESPN's Jesse Rogers.\n\nMLB owners wanted to crack down on the tactic due to concern over first- and third-base coaches moving up and down the foul line to try to get a better view of the pitcher, per ESPN. If those coaches discovered what pitch was coming, they would reportedly relay that information directly to the batter or to a runner on second base, who could signal to the hitter what pitch was coming.\n\nThe league attempted to curb the tactic during the 2025 World Series, when it told both the Los Angeles Dodgers and Toronto Blue Jays to make sure their first- and third-base coaches stayed in their designated coaches' boxes on the field.\n\nWith the creation of PitchCom, the art of stealing catcher signs is essentially extinct around the league. Because MLB teams will try to exploit any advantage possible, teams and coaches have turned to extensive film study ahead of games, trying to find tells from the pitcher or catcher to determine what pitch is coming next. Unlike the pitch-stealing scandal the Houston Astros engaged in during the 2017 MLB season, this version of pitch-stealing is completely legal since it doesn't rely on the in-game use of technology.\n\nIn 2017, the Astros were accused of using cameras and video monitors to steal signs from their opponents. After MLB conducted an investigation into those claims, commissioner Rob Manfred announced one-year suspensions for then-Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow and then-manager A.J. Hinch. Shortly after those suspensions were announced, the Astros fired both men.\n\nBoston Red Sox manager Alex Cora was later suspended for a year for his involvement in the scandal. Cora previously coached with the Astros before being hired by the Red Sox in 2018. The Red Sox fired Cora ahead of the 2020 season, but brought him back for the 2021 MLB season.\n\nPlayers and coaches are allowed to steal signs from pitchers or catchers during games without the use of technology, but MLB reportedly felt first- and third-base coaches were getting too brazen with their tactics, per ESPN.\n\nThe MLB rulebook states the first- and third-base coaches must remain in their coaches' box from the time the pitcher steps on the pitching rubber to the time the ball is caught by the catcher or put in play. Coaches, however, are allowed to leave the coaches' box for safety reasons.\n\nUnder the new rule, first- and third-base coaches will receive a warning for their first violation. After that, coaches could be ejected from games for leaving the coaches' box too early, per ESPN.",

The firm pointed to recent market volatility stemming from President Donald Trump's threats on Greenland.\n\nGeopolitical conflict could have a more significant impact on AI trade down the line, considering that Europe is a major market for the US tech sector, it added. The US's allies and partners in Europe make up around 40% of revenue among tech firms, per Capital Economics' analysis.\n\n\"But our sense is that for those to have a lasting effect on the AI rally, they'd have to either have a sizeable effect on the US economy or on tech companies' earnings through some other channel,\" Mathew added of the risk.",

    "fullText": "The US Food and Drug Administration has refused to accept an application from Moderna to review its first mRNA seasonal flu vaccine, the company said Tuesday, in another setback for the technology that’s been a target of some Trump administration health officials.\n\nThe agency told Moderna that its application didn’t contain an “adequate and well-controlled” trial because the control arm didn’t reflect the “best-available standard of care in the United States at the time of the study,” according to a letter dated February 3 that Moderna posted online. It didn’t identify any safety or efficacy concerns, the company said.\n\nModerna said that the refusal was inconsistent with previous feedback from the agency and that it had requested a meeting with FDA officials to understand how to proceed.\n\n“The complete stunner here is at no point in any of this did anybody say that it was not adequate” to run its clinical trial the way it had discussed with the agency, Moderna’s president, Dr. Stephen Hoge, told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services said “the FDA generally does not comment on regulatory communications to individual sponsors.” It’s rare for the FDA to issue a “refuse-to-file” letter; a 2021 study of almost 2,500 applications submitted to the agency found that only 4% received such letters.\n\nModerna used a standard-dose seasonal flu vaccine called Fluarix as a comparator in a 40,700-person clinical trial to demonstrate the experimental mRNA vaccine’s safety and efficacy. The company said the FDA had agreed with that plan in April 2024 but suggested it also include data comparing its vaccine with an approved high-dose flu vaccine for people over 65, which the company said it did.\n\nModerna added that as recently as August, in a meeting before it submitted its application for approval of the vaccine, the FDA suggested that it would review the filing and assess issues with the comparator during that process. The agency did note that there could be a “significant issue” with the data “during review” of the application, according to written feedback that Moderna shared.\n\nBut last week, the agency refused to do the review at all, according to the letter. It was signed by Dr. Vinay Prasad, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which oversees vaccine regulation.\n\nPrasad was an outspoken critic of the government’s response to Covid-19 before he was appointed to the FDA under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He claimed late last year without providing details that Covid-19 vaccines resulted in deaths of 10 children and has said the agency will change its vaccine approval process.\n\nModerna is one of three manufacturers in the US of approved Covid-19 vaccines, along with Pfizer and Novavax. Moderna and Pfizer’s vaccines use mRNA technology. Pfizer also has mRNA-based flu vaccines in development.\n\nAlthough the record-speed development of mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccines during the pandemic was a chief accomplishment of Trump’s first term, his second administration has withdrawn support for mRNA technology in infectious diseases. HHS canceled 22 projects worth about $500 million focused on mRNA vaccine development in August, claiming against evidence that “these vaccines fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu.”\n\nCovid-19 vaccines are estimated to have saved millions of lives. The hope behind applying mRNA technology to seasonal flu vaccines is that it could improve how well they work, enable tailoring for geographic regions where different strains are circulating and lead to combinations with Covid-19 vaccines so people would need only one shot for protection against both viruses.\n\nWith currently approved technology, experts select flu strains for each fall’s seasonal vaccines during the preceding February. Hoge pointed out that mRNA vaccines can be manufactured much faster; for Covid-19 vaccines, he said, the design is decided in May or June, for shipping by August.\n\nChoosing the strains closer to the start of flu season could potentially lead to a better match with circulating viruses, “and better matching equals, usually, better protection,” Hoge said.\n\nModerna’s phase 3 study showed in results reported in June that the mRNA-based flu shot produced efficacy that was about 27% higher than Fluarix in adults 50 and older. A separate trial that assessed safety and immune response included the comparison with a high-dose flu vaccine for people 65 and older and showed superiority, Moderna said.\n\nImmune response is assessed in the laboratory by analyzing blood samples of people who’ve been vaccinated, while efficacy assessments typically involve seeing how well a vaccine protects against cases of the disease.\n\nModerna had been awaiting the start of the review of its flu shot before it moved its experimental combination flu and Covid-19 mRNA vaccine into the FDA review process, Hoge said. That’s now on hold as the company awaits a meeting and further guidance from the agency.\n\nMeanwhile, the combination vaccine is moving forward in other countries.\n\n“We do expect that our first approval will be … probably in Europe, and this year,” Hoge said. “So that’ll be a milestone event.”",

    "description": "Salesforce's senior VP of business technology said he tries to teach his kids resilience, and it's a skill is important for entry-level talent, too.",
    "fullText": "As companies rethink how they train early-career workers in a job market shaped by AI, Salesforce executive Andy White said resilience is top of mind for him — both at work and at home.\n\nWhite oversees Salesforce's implementation of Slackbot, an AI personal agent that generates responses based on conversations, files, and workflows inside Slack.\n\nAs White raises his son and daughter during a period of rapid technological change, he said he preaches to his kids the importance of powering through moments that don't go as planned. He said resilience is pivotal and that it's important for people to focus on doing the hard things and being OK when things don't go as expected.\n\nThe senior vice president of business technology said he recently spoke with his daughter about the importance of dealing with situations rather than merely labeling them as \"good\" or \"bad.\"\n\n\"Hard is hard,\" White told Business Insider. \"Hard isn't necessarily bad.\"\n\nExpectations, he said, are the \"destroyer of hope and joy,\" and that when things don't go as planned, it often turns out to be a good thing down the line, even if it doesn't seem that way in the moment.\n\n\"It's when we look back, and it's like, 'Oh man, I'm glad that didn't go the way I expected,'\" White said. \"But when you're in it, it's really hard.\"\n\nThe resilience lesson is one White also thinks is relevant for entry-level workers. While junior hires often arrive ready to use new tools and deliver a \"pretty high output,\" he said, persistence is an area where some still need to grow.\n\nHe described today's entry-level talent pool as \"incredibly capable, very bright, and very driven,\" with a stronger grasp of how to use AI tools to solve problems.\n\n\"They're much more fluent at being able to leverage AI tooling in the flow of their work,\" White said.\n\nHowever, he said the group sometimes struggles when it comes to working through challenges.\n\n\"There's more willingness to give up sooner,\" he said, adding that this trait doesn't apply across the board.\n\nWhite said he's seen AI tools, such as the company's recently upgraded Slackbot, help boost entry-level workers' confidence. He said they could help reduce feelings of imposter syndrome by helping early-career workers navigate challenging situations that arise at work.\n\nWith that said, White added that workers need to stay balanced and not let tools make them \"overly confident.\" He said workers need to bring skepticism to \"any kind of information\" they get, and be diligent about reviewing sources and citations when using AI.\n\n\"If you don't believe something, read the citation, and if it doesn't have a citation, you have to assume it's a hallucination,\" White said, adding that he tells his kids the same thing.",

It’s like a technology monastery thing, remote and mostly dudes.”\n\nSpouses, he said, are often unwilling to relocate to the isolated area.\n\nMusk companies also have operations in Robstown McGregor, Bastrop and elsewhere across the state.\n\nHe disclosed the issues on the Cheeky Pint podcast during a chat in which he also accused tech giant Apple Inc. of trying to poach Tesla’s talent when that company was working on its own self-driving electric car, a project it later scrapped.\n\n“They were carpet bombing Tesla with recruiting calls,” Musk said. He claimed their opening offer would be roughly double the compensation at Tesla, indicating what he referred to as a “Tesla pixie dust” factor, in which other companies assume if they could hire someone from Tesla, the employee would put them on track to success.\n\n“When we had the pixie dust problem, we would get relentlessly recruited from,” Musk said. “Also, Tesla being engineering, especially being primarily in Silicon Valley, it’s easier for people to just… They don’t have to change their life very much. Their commute’s going to be the same.”\n\nREAD NEXT: Elon Musk and Jeffrey Epstein had closer ties than disclosed, newly released files show\n\nJohn Collison, co-founder of Stripe and podcast host, asked Musk how he guards against poachers. Musk said there’s not much that can stop it.\n\nMusk has long been trying to draw tech talent to Texas, with a renewed push after last week’s announcement that SpaceX acquired xAI. Days after giving notice of the plan, Michael Nicolls, vice president of Starlink engineering, said the SpaceX-owned satellite company is hiring for critical engineering roles to develop technologies for AI satellites in space at the company’s facilities in Austin and Seattle.",

    "fullText": "Newly released documents detail convicted sex offender’s early backing of bitcoin and Coinbase\n\nMillions of files related to Jeffrey Epstein have brought to light his ties to the highest echelons of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nDocuments published last week by the US Department of Justice reveal Epstein bankrolled the “principal home and funding source” for bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, during its nascent stages; he also invested $3m in Coinbase in 2014, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, and cut a check that same year to Blockstream, a prominent bitcoin-focused technology firm. Both crypto startups accepted Epstein’s investments in 2014 – six years after his 2008 conviction in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor.\n\nDespite murmurings among crypto communities online about the need for a sector-level reckoning around the Epstein files’ revelations, most industry players predict few consequences for crypto companies or the sector writ large. Some see Epstein as a “skeptical investor” who pulled out of his crypto investments prematurely; others go so far as to claim Epstein was attempting to “undermine bitcoin”.\n\nThe crypto companies that secured Epstein’s investment have grown into multibillion-dollar giants, especially Coinbase, which went public on the Nasdaq in 2021, and whose co-founder, Brian Armstrong, has heavily influenced crypto regulation in the United States.\n\nEpstein’s 2014 investment in Coinbase was brokered by the crypto evangelist Brock Pierce, a former child actor and a co-founder of Tether, the world’s largest issuer of stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency whose value is typically pegged to a national currency.\n\nDocuments published by the justice department reveal Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of Coinbase who spearheaded its fundraise, liaised with Pierce about Epstein’s investment in the company and sought to meet with Epstein “if convenient”. Additional filings suggest Epstein sold half of his shares to Pierce’s firm, Blockchain Capital, for $15m in 2018.\n\nA spokeswoman for Coinbase declined to comment; Pierce did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nEpstein’s financing of bitcoin’s development stemmed from his role as a donor to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Over the course of 20 years, MIT accepted more than $800,000 from Epstein, who also facilitated more than $7m in donations from other wealthy individuals.\n\nIn communications from 2015 between Joichi Ito, then director of MIT’s Media Lab, a tech-focused research institute, and Epstein, Ito wrote that Epstein’s “gift funds” were used to “underwrite” the launch of the Digital Currency Initiative, an offshoot of the Lab tasked with researching and developing open-source crypto technologies; in the same email thread, Ito explained that the Lab’s role was to serve as the “principal home and funding source” for bitcoin. The Digital Currency Initiative did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn 2014, Ito brokered Epstein’s investment in Blockstream, which builds bitcoin-focused tech solutions. Epstein made a $500,000 early-stage investment in the company through an investment fund he co-owned with Ito. Email communications reveal Blockstream’s co-founders, Adam Back and Austin Hill, were invited by Epstein to meet in St Thomas, close to Little Saint James, the private island Epstein owned.\n\nOn Twitter, Back claimed that Blockstream understood Epstein to be a “limited partner in Ito’s fund”, which later divested from Blockstream “due to a potential conflict of interest, and other concerns” – meaning that “Blockstream has no direct nor indirect financial connection with Jeffrey Epstein, or his estate”.\n\nIn communications with an Italian investor, Epstein noted that he “like[d]” Back. Hill continued communicating with Epstein into 2017, checking in with his “friend” following a storm in the Caribbean. “Just checking that your Island is OK,” reads the email thread’s subject line. Representatives for Blockstream and Hill did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLuke Dashjr, an early contributor to bitcoin’s development as well as to Blockstream, has called for Adam Back to resign from his role as Blockstream’s CEO over ties to Epstein. In an interview with the Guardian, Dashjr said Epstein’s interest in bitcoin – namely, his “attempts to undermine” bitcoin’s network, early-stage companies, and developers – was a sign that “evil men often seek to destroy what is good”.\n\nCharlotte Fang, the founder of Remilia, which makes NFTs and other crypto-based art, said “only unserious people might care” about Epstein’s investment in bitcoin and Coinbase; in the latter case, “only the financially unsophisticated” would assume that he had “any degree of influence over the direction” of the exchange, as his seven-figure investment was a small part of Coinbase’s fundraise.\n\n“Bitcoin is a decentralized technology that required no funding, and Epstein was evidently a skeptical investor, who got in later than I did, and exited earlier than he should have,” Fang said.\n\n“Generally speaking, retail consumers will not change their habits” around crypto following this recent release of Epstein files, according to Kadan Stadelmann of Komodo, a crypto platform. Investor practices, including their dependence on connections to cut checks, will probably adhere to the status quo, he added. Some competitor crypto exchanges might see new customers who are leaving Coinbase following these new allegations, he hypothesized – as long as these exchanges didn’t take money from “similar unsavory sources”.\n\nAs to why Epstein was so interested in crypto, and in Coinbase specifically? “Epstein might have liked Coinbase’s IPO prospects,” he surmised.\n\nCryptocurrencies’ technological capabilities may have also played a role in Epstein’s interest in the sector, said Antulio Rosales, a professor at York University who studies crypto.\n\n“There’s his possibility of seeing markets without any ethical commitments, and without any pressures of social norms and of the law itself,” he said.",

    "fullText": "In Silicon Valley, many investors, founders, and tech giants often frame AI as an all-powerful force — something approaching omniscience.\n\nThey call it artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a hypothetical system capable of matching or exceeding human reasoning across virtually all tasks and, beyond that, superintelligence, which would surpass human cognition altogether.\n\nAGI is the thing OpenAI and its competitors are racing to be the first to bring to life.\n\nThe industry isn't a monolith, however, nor are its builders.\n\nPeter Steinberger, the creator of OpenClaw, the now-viral personal AI assistant powering the agent-only social network, Moltbook, told the Y Combinator podcast on Saturday that he thinks the best AI is specialized, not generalized.\n\n\"What can one human being actually achieve? Do you think one human being could make an iPhone or one human being could go to space?\" he said. \"As a group we specialize, as a larger society we specialize even more.\"\n\nHe said the same holds true for AI. Current AI systems are labeled as \"general.\" In practice, however, they are already specialized for particular tasks — like startups building models to solve Erdos math problems or identify gene mutations.\n\nWhile the hype around AI has largely focused on the types of models being built — from large language models to computer vision systems or even world models — some startups and tech giants are also experimenting with more focused, subject-specific forms of intelligence.\n\nAxiom, a startup founded by former Meta researcher Carina Hong and backed by $64 million in seed funding, for instance, is building specialized intelligence to tackle advanced mathematics.\n\nGoogle DeepMind has developed AlphaGenome, a system designed to predict how variants or mutations in human DNA affect a wide range of gene-regulating biological processes.\n\nCompanies are also developing smaller models, which could make it easier to build AI systems tailored to specific subjects or domains. Aidan Gomez, the CEO of Cohere, which builds AI technology for enterprises, told Business Insider in 2024 that there was increasing pressure to build \"smaller, more efficient models\" and to make them smarter with the right data and algorithms, rather than just scaling them.\n\nSteinberger is not the only one to push back against the idea of an all-powerful general intelligence.\n\nTimnit Gebru, a computer scientist who founded and leads the Distributed AI Research Institute, said AGI is a \"fictional thing\" in a November video published by Nature.\n\nShe said the backbone of engineering lies in building well-scoped, testable systems. The pursuit of a \"fictional, undefined 'machine god,'\" she said, is pushing the industry toward deeper labor exploitation and environmental damage.\n\nSteinberger, previously best known for launching the PDF processing company PSPDFKit, came out of retirement to build with AI. He said the technology has come a long way since he started, when his goal was simply to build \"something that could type stuff so my computer could do things.\"",

    "fullText": "Authors, a newsreader, a lawyer and an esteemed colleague: they’re all great – but I’m not married to any of them. Can we really depend on this technology?\n\nRecently, the Rowsons accidentally invented a new game that anyone can play at home. I have yet to come up with a world-beating name for it, so for now let’s just call it “How bloody stupid is AI?” The playing of the game will change from player to player, depending on their circumstances – but essentially the rules remain the same. Ask AI a simple question about yourself, and see just how wrong it gets it.\n\nIn my case, all you need know is that while I, through the nature of my job, have a fairly large online presence, my partner (we married in 1987) has assiduously avoided having one at all. Which means that if you Google “Martin Rowson wife” in images, you may get a picture of me next to our then 14-year-old daughter or me with my friend and fellow cartoonist Steven Appleby, who happens to be trans but has kept her given first name.\n\nIt’s probably incredibly reckless of me to say so, but I find this very funny. As a satirist, I have always been a fool for anything that points up the even greater folly of our leaders, the tools of their techbro masters or the true capabilities of our new robot overlords. Anyway, I was explaining all this to our soon-to-be daughter-in-law over Christmas when our children (in their 30s, and therefore much tech-savvier than me) explained that it was much more fun than that, and that I should ask: “Who is Martin Rowson’s wife?”\n\nImagine my delight when the first answer from Google search’s AI overview was “Jeanette Winterson”. (To be clear, I swear on the lives of the entire population of Silicon Valley that the famous lesbian author categorically is not my wife.) But it got better – and here comes the sublime beauty of the mesmeric imbecility of the Tool That Will Transform The World. Each time we repeated the question, the answer changed, then changed again. This seemed dependent on how the question was phrased or punctuated, but who knows? Here is the list of my alleged wives I compiled before I finally got bored:\n\nTextile designer Fiona Scott-Wilson.\n\nActor Fiona Marr, she of Bridgerton.\n\nJulia Mills (though it’s unclear whether this is the fantasy author, the illustrator, the late powerlifter or another Julia Mills altogether).\n\nWriter and journalist Emily Rees.\n\nLawyer and academic Siva Thambisetty, who is married to chess grandmaster Jonathan Rowson. AI also claims Jonathan and I are brothers. We’re not.\n\nWriter and journalist Carrie McLaren.\n\nChannel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman.\n\nCNN correspondent Clarissa Ward.\n\nJournalist and broadcaster Rachel Johnson.\n\nThen it got really weird. La femme Rowson, AI said, is actually “journalist and author Kate Clements Rowson”. Googled that name: none the wiser.\n\nThen it suggested I’m married to “writer/illustrator Helen Grant”. Apparently our son, Leo, is a jazz musician. Again, who is she? Nothing on Google. And Leo, who he? Does he really play jazz? Does he exist?\n\nThere was “former Guardian political editor & current CEO of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation Liz Kerr”. Que? There is no Guardian political editor, past or present, of that name. Liz Kerr nowhere appears on the list of the great and good at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Once again, all wrong. Playwright Lee Hall got a mention. He’s male, so couldn’t be my wife anyway.\n\nAs for “historian and writer Jeanette Winterbottom”. We apparently worked together on “The Guardian Book of Satire” and “The Dog’s Diary”, it says here. Maybe AI confused her with Jeanette Winterson, but then she and I didn’t collaborate on those projects, there is no Guardian Book of Satire, and I have never published a Dog’s Diary (though if someone wants to send me royalties for that, I’d take them).\n\nAnother search, another skipful of gibberish. “He’s been married to writer and journalist Ann Widdecombe (his ex-wife), Cathy Caldwell, and his long-term partner/wife, journalist and author, Polly Toynbee is a frequent figure alongside him in media, suggesting they are a prominent couple in UK literary/journalistic circles.”\n\nFor the record, I have met Rachel Johnson and my own daughter, but am married to neither of them. Again and again the bot failed to identify my real wife, to everyone’s relief, although latterly it’s begun saying: “Her name is not publicly named in the provided search results.”\n\nI suppose this suggests a capacity for learning, but maybe not. I asked “who is my wife?” once more for the purposes of this article, and Google’s AI said I’m married to “Debora Rowson (nee Ffrench)”, a retired civil servant, and ascribed to our wholly fictitious union is my extra daughter, Clementine, yet another writer/journalist. Apparently, I write about our amusing domestic upsets in my imaginary Guardian column.\n\nWhile my mythical marriage to Boris Johnson’s sister is obvious comedy gold (imagine that family Christmas!), for this nonsense to be the fruit of a garlanded, universal research tool used by billions – and for it to be repeatedly, serially wrong – is more than slightly disturbing.\n\nWe should all by now have worked out that AI is about as sentient as an abacus, and only truly mirrors the human mind in its capacity to lie to humans, telling them what it “thinks” they want to hear. It is also a universal truth that the world’s most dangerous people are idiots who think they are really, really clever (just look around and you’ll get the point). Add those two facts together and what on earth do you imagine we will end up with?\n\nI wouldn’t ask AI that, it would probably say “banana bread”, then change its mind to, “Exterminate them all!”\n\nMartin Rowson is a cartoonist and author",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Singapore (AP) — This week’s Singapore Air Show brought together trade delegations from around the world to show off the latest in civilian and military aviation technology.\n\nThe event this year marked the 10th edition of the air show, which showcased cutting-edge planes from the Royal Australian Air Force and the United States Air Force. This included the F-35 Lightning II, the latest U.S.-made fifth-generation fighter jet that has integrated stealth technology and is considered one of the world’s most advanced combat aircraft.\n\nMajor commercial plane makers also touted the latest advancements in their fleets, including Airbus, Bombardier, Gulfstream, Boeing and China’s Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, known as COMAC.\n\n“We have a very good representation of the latest and the greatest,” said Leck Chet Lam, managing director of Experia Events, which organizes the event. “The Singapore Air Show, the unique part of it is we cover both the aviation and also the defense industries.”\n\nDuring the Singapore Air Show's aerial displays, COMAC promoted its C919 passenger jet, which China is pushing as an alternative to the European Airbus A320neo and the American Boeing 737 MAX. The daily aerial displays at the event also showcased six military teams and Airbus’ A350-1000.\n\nWithin the exhibition hall, the air show featured experimental air taxis, advanced flight simulators, a wide variety of drones and both manned and unmanned helicopters. The static aircraft display under Singapore’s sizzling sun included roughly 35 planes from more than 10 countries.\n\nIn all, more than 1,000 companies from around 50 countries participated in the air show, hosted on the grounds of Changi International Airport, Southeast Asia's busiest airport. The event, which opened on Feb. 3, is considered Asia’s largest aerospace and defense exhibition and runs through Feb. 8.\n\n“All the exhibitors can use Singapore as a springboard to then tap into the opportunities that are rising in the Asia-Pacific market, which is a key driver that is driving the growth of the global aviation industry,\" Lam said.\n\nThis is a photo gallery curated by AP photo editors.",

    "fullText": "Technology has dramatically changed the beverage market.\n\n\"About 30% of milk was still delivered to homes in the 1960s,\" according to USDA agricultural surveys, and prior to that, had been the most common way consumers got their milk, Food52 reported.\n\nIt was actually the growth of supermarkets and the prevalence of car ownership that ultimately made the milk man irrelevant.\n\nShipping and storage technology has also changed the beverage market.\n\nJuice concentrates, for example, were created for a logical reason.\n\n\"Frozen concentrated orange juice was invented in Florida in the 1940s, primarily as a way to provide juice for the military, readily storable and easy to ship. But frozen juice has been losing favor for years,\" the Wall Street Journal reported in 2015.\n\nNow, Coca-Cola has dealt another blow to the struggling market for juice concentrates.\n\nNot-from-concentrate orange juice surpassed the concentrated orange-juice market in the 1980s, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing data from Nielsen.\n\nCoca-Cola's Minute Maid brand, however, has continued to make concentrated orange juice and lemonade in a variety of flavors including raspberry lemonade, pink lemonade, and limeade.\n\nThe beverage giant has decided to discontinue Minute Maid’s frozen canned orange juices and lemonades after 80 years as consumer demand declines.\n\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\n\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\n\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\n\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\n\n\"Minute Maid frozen products will be discontinued in North America in the first quarter of 2026, with in-store inventory available when supplies last,\" a Coca-Cola spokesperson told Food Dive.\n\n“With the juice category growing strongly, we’re focusing on products that better match what our consumers want,” the spokesperson said.\n\n\"Juice concentrate is a thick liquid made by removing the water content from fruit juice. This process involves heating the juice to evaporate the water, leaving behind a concentrated form of the juice's flavor and nutrients. It is like making fruit juice more potent by taking out most of the water,\" according to Business Research Insights.\n\nIt can be stored for longer than fresh juice, and while demand has slipped in U.S. homes, it's still used by manufacturers, and the global market is growing.\n\nThe global juice concentrates market is projected to grow from about $83.9 billion in 2025 to nearly $134.1 billion by 2035, reflecting strong long‑term expansion driven by beverage demand worldwide.\n\nIn the broader fruit concentrate segment, the market is valued at roughly $20.95 billion in 2025 and expected to reach around $36.96 billion by 2035, growing at a CAGR of 5.8%.\n\nOther forecasts show the juice concentrates industry growing from about $67.6 billion in 2025 to an estimated $94.6 billion by 2030, with CAGR near 7%, highlighting rising demand for natural and functional beverage ingredients.\n\nNorth America dominates with nearly 35% market share due to strong demand, advanced infrastructure, and abundant agricultural resources.\n\nOrange juice from concentrate was something my parents always had in my childhood home in the 1980s, though I never actually drank it. Back then, it felt like a household staple, even if it didn’t end up in my glass.\n\nSjors Peters, global innovation marketing leader for beverages at IFF, believes that consumer perceptions around taste, naturality, and health have continued to drive demand for Not From Concentrate (NFC) over Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice (FCOJ), Food Ingredients First reported.\n\n“The preference for NFC juice over FCOJ has also been accentuated by the lack of carryover from previous crops. One effect of higher NFC production has been a drastic reduction in the availability of orange essence oil,” he says.\n\nBack in 2020, Coca-Cola slashed its beverage lineup, killing a number of well-known brands including TaB, its original diet soda product. It also killed the Odwalla juice line, and Zico, a coconut water brand.\n\n\"Reducing the portfolio will allow Coca-Cola to focus on its most profitable offerings, the company explained. Those include its core products like Coca-Cola Zero Sugar as well as brands that fit into trendy new categories, like Topo Chico hard seltzer and AHA, a caffeinated seltzer the company launched last year,\" CNN Business reported at the time.\n\nDuring that culling, Coca-Cola stopped making approximately 200 different beverages. The company explained the decision at the time.\n\n\"The company continues to pursue its beverages for life ambition by calibrating a portfolio with an optimal set of global, regional and local brands with the strongest potential to grow their consumer bases, increase frequency and drive system margins. The company expects to offer a portfolio of approximately 200 master brands, an approximate 50% reduction from the current number,\" it shared in a press release.\n\nSince then, Coca-Cola has not had a widespread purge of brands, but it has made regular cuts when a product or product line did not meet performance expectations.",

The two go hand-in-hand,\" he said in comments to ‌Reuters.\n\nOnly 35 countries out of 85 attending the Responsible AI in the Military Domain (REAIM) summit in A Coruna, Spain, on signed a commitment to 20 principles on AI on Thursday.\n\nThese included affirming human responsibility over AI-powered weapons, encouraging clear chains of command and control, and sharing information on national oversight arrangements \"where consistent with national security\".\n\nThe document also outlined the ⁠importance of risk assessments, robust testing and training ​and education for personnel operating military AI capabilities.\n\nAt two ​prior military AI summits in The Hague and Seoul in 2023 and 2024 respectively, around 60 nations, excluding China but including the United States, ‍endorsed a modest \"blueprint ⁠for action\" without legal commitment.\n\nWhile this year's document was also non-binding, some were still uncomfortable with the idea of endorsing more concrete policies, said Yasmin Afina, a ⁠researcher at the U.N. Institute for Disarmament Research, an adviser on the process.\n\nMajor signatories on Thursday included ‌Canada, Germany, France, Britain, the Netherlands, South Korea and Ukraine.",

    "fullText": "SpaceX and Tesla both began in California before relocating their headquarters to Texas — a move Elon Musk has said created a hiring challenge.\n\nMusk, the CEO of both companies, said married technicians, engineers, and scientists have struggled to bring their families to certain parts of the state. The problem is most acute at SpaceX's south Texas launch site and headquarters, known as Starbase.\n\n\"I call it the 'significant other' problem,\" Musk said during a nearly three-hour interview with tech podcaster Dwarkesh Patel and Stripe's cofounder John Collison that was posted on Thursday. \"For Starbase, that was particularly difficult, since the odds of finding a non-SpaceX job are pretty low.\"\n\nStarbase — where SpaceX has built and tested its rockets since 2019 — is situated in a sparsely populated area of Texas, close to the US‑Mexico border. It's located across from the largely undeveloped Las Palomas Wildlife Management Area.\n\nThe campus is roughly a 40‑minute drive from Brownsville, the nearest city, according to Google Maps. Brownsville has a population of around 187,000, based on the most recent US Census data.\n\nThat remoteness marks a sharp contrast with SpaceX's former headquarters in El Segundo, California, which is minutes from Los Angeles and part of one of the country's largest job markets.\n\n\"It's like a technology monastery thing,\" Musk said about Starbase. \n\"Remote and mostly dudes.\"\n\nTesla, which moved its headquarters from California to Austin in 2021, faces a similar — though less severe — challenge, Musk said.\n\nThe automaker's campus, called Giga Texas, is a roughly 30-minute drive from downtown Austin, where nearly 1 million people live. Plus, while Tesla's top executives have largely moved to Texas, the electric car company still maintains several robotics, energy, and manufacturing operations in California.\n\n\"Tesla being engineering, especially being primarily in Silicon Valley, it's easier for people to just... They don't have to change their life very much. Their commutes are going to be the same,\" he said. \"Tesla still has a majority of its engineering in California.\"\n\nMusk, who has predicted Austin will be \"the biggest boomtown that America has seen in 50 years,\" has made moves to build out his company campuses, including a company town called \"Snailbrook\" near The Boring Company and SpaceX.",

    "fullText": "Man misidentified by London supermarket using Facewatch system says: ‘I shouldn’t have to prove I am not a criminal’\n\nA man was ordered to leave a supermarket in London after staff misidentified him using controversial new facial recognition technology.\n\nWarren Rajah was told to abandon his shopping and leave the local store he has been using for a number of years after an “Orwellian” error in a Sainsbury’s in Elephant and Castle, London.\n\nHe said supermarket staff were unable to explain why he was being told to leave, and would only direct him to a QR code leading to the website of the firm Facewatch, which the retailer has hired to run facial recognition in some of its stores. He said when he contacted Facewatch, he was told to send in a picture of himself and a photograph of his passport before the firm confirmed it had no record of him on its database.\n\n“One of the reasons I was angry was because I shouldn’t have to prove I am innocent,” Rajah said. “I shouldn’t have to prove I’m wrongly identified as a criminal.” He described the incident as feeling “quite like Minority Report, Orwellian”.\n\nHe said while doing his normal shop, he was approached by three members of the store’s staff, one of whom appeared to affirm that he was the person pictured on a device they had. It is understood the Facewatch system flagged someone else who had entered the store, and staff mistook Rajah for him.\n\nRajah was concerned some form of permanent record implying he had been involved in criminality might have been created on Facewatch’s system. Eventually, the firm told him he was not on its database and referred him back to Sainsbury’s.\n\n“You felt quite helpless in the situation because you’re just thrown from pillar to post – because Sainsbury’s initially blame Facewatch, then Facewatch retort saying it’s actually Sainsbury’s,” he said. “And then, when Sainsbury’s called me on Wednesday from the executive office, they blamed the store staff. So they’re constantly shifting the blame as to who’s responsible for this.”\n\nRajah was upset that he felt he had had to prove his innocence – and said he had received little assurance about how the information he had to hand over to Facewatch was stored, and whether it had been deleted.\n\nAnd he said that, while he was lucky enough to be able to navigate the system, “what happens to the vulnerable people who, for example, have learning disabilities or don’t know how to scan a QR code? They haven’t put any processes or procedures in place for anybody to challenge this. You should not be expected to send your personal information – that is totally unacceptable.”\n\nSainsbury’s said: “We have been in contact with Mr Rajah to sincerely apologise for his experience in our Elephant and Castle store. This was not an issue with the facial recognition technology in use but a case of the wrong person being approached in store.”\n\nFacewatch said: “We’re sorry to hear about Mr Rajah’s experience and understand why it would have been upsetting. This incident arose from a case of human error in store, where a member of staff approached the wrong customer.\n\n“Our data protection team followed the usual process to confirm his identity and verified that he was not on our database and had not been subject to any alerts generated by Facewatch.”",

    "title": "A New AI Math Startup Just Cracked 4 Previously Unsolved Problems",
    "description": "Axiom says its AI found solutions to several long-standing math problems, a sign of the technology’s steadily advancing reasoning capabilities.",
    "fullText": "mathematicians Dawei Chen and Quentin Gendron were trying to untangle a difficult area of algebraic geometry involving differentials, elements of calculus used to measure distance along curved surfaces. While working on one theorem, they ran into an unexpected roadblock: Their argument depended on a strange formula from number theory, but they were unable to solve or justify it. In the end, Chen and Gendron wrote a paper presenting their idea as a conjecture, rather than a theorem.\n\nChen recently spent hours prompting ChatGPT in the hopes of getting the AI to come up with a solution to the still unsolved problem, but it wasn’t working. Then, during a reception at a math conference in Washington, DC, last month, Chen ran into Ken Ono, a well-known mathematician who had recently left his job at the University of Virginia to join Axiom, an artificial intelligence startup cofounded by one of his mentees, Carina Hong.\n\nChen told Ono about the problem, and the following morning, Ono presented him with a proof, courtesy of his startup’s math-solving AI, AxiomProver. “Everything fell into place naturally after that,” says Chen, who worked with Axiom to write up the proof, which has now been posted to arXiv, a public repository for academic papers.\n\nAxiom’s AI tool found a connection between the problem and a numerical phenomenon first studied in the 19th century. It then devised a proof, which it helpfully verified itself. “What AxiomProver found was something that all the humans had missed,” Ono tells WIRED.\n\nThe proof is one of several solutions to unsolved math problems that Axiom says its system has come up with in recent weeks. The AI has not yet solved any of the most famous (or lucrative) problems in the field of mathematics, but it has found answers to questions that have stumped experts in different areas for years. The proofs are evidence of AI’s steadily advancing math abilities. In recent months, other mathematicians have reported using AI tools to explore new ideas and solve existing problems.\n\nThe techniques being developed by Axiom may prove useful outside the world of advanced math. For example, the same approaches could be used to develop software that is more resilient to certain kinds of cybersecurity attacks. This would involve using AI to verify that code is provably reliable and trustworthy.\n\n“Math is really the great test ground and sandbox for reality,” says Hong, Axiom’s CEO. “We do believe that there are a lot of pretty important use cases of high commercial value.”\n\nAxiom’s approach involves combining large language models with a proprietary AI system called AxiomProver that is trained to reason through math problems to reach solutions that are provably correct. In 2024, Google demonstrated a similar idea with a system called AlphaProof. Hong says that AxiomSolver incorporates several significant advances and newer techniques.\n\nOno says the AI-generated proof for the Chen-Gendron conjecture shows how AI can now meaningfully assist professional mathematicians. “This is a new paradigm for proving theorems,” he says.\n\nAxiom’s system is more than just a regular AI model, in that it is able to verify proofs using a specialized mathematical language called Lean. Rather than just search through the literature, this allows AxiomProver to develop genuinely novel ways of solving problems.\n\nAnother one of the new proofs generated by AxiomProver demonstrates how the AI is capable of solving math problems entirely on its own. That proof, which has also been described in a paper posted to arXiv, provides a solution to Fel’s Conjecture, which concerns syzygies, or mathematical expressions where numbers line up in algebra. Remarkably, the conjecture involves formulas first found in the notebook of legendary Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan more than 100 years ago. In this case AxiomProver did not just fill in a missing piece of the puzzle, it devised the proof from start to finish.",

    "fullText": "As late as December 30th 2025, Hopsworks's website contained well over 1,000 pages. It was a mix of blogs, dictionary entries, videos, and various content types - but mostly, it was a pile of legacy pages and landing pages.\n\nAs of today, February 2026, thanks to tools like Claude Code, we have completely shifted our approach. Within a week, we have cut our page count in half, moved away from our legacy hosting and CMS, and essentially refactored the whole site. The result is a platform that is:\n\nBack in 2018, we chose Webflow as our hosting and CMS solution. Quite honestly, it proved to be exactly what we needed at the time. It was easy for non-technical users to maintain and made adding content easy. But, like everything else, this convenience came at a cost. Over time, we accumulated layers of legacy content and structural debt. We became highly dependent on their platform, meaning our entire library was hosted on their infrastructure with very little flexibility to move out.\n\nA few of us on the team grew to be avid - if not overly enthusiastic - users of Claude Code, not unlike a large portion of your favourite social media's front-page I am sure. And as our internal usage grew over the course of the year, a new paradigm emerged. As product owners, and marketeers, we realized we no longer wanted to spend time \"moving boxes\" in a UI. We wanted to alter and shape the code directly to output what we needed, often based on existing content.\n\nAnd so we realised over time that the handy low-code/UI-driven approach of Webflow became not quite so handy anymore. We wanted to change the code directly, not just tweak a component here and there. Dragging and dropping had simply become a drag that we wanted to drop (pun intended).\n\nWe made the jump in a single go. We pulled the whole website and its content library, asked Claude to parse it, created a skeleton using an open-source headless CMS, and migrated all content to Markdown We then re-created the frontend, partly based on the same UI library we use for our own software platform.\n\nTwo hours later, a functional, viable draft containing the entire content of the old website was online.\n\nIt took just two hours to rebuild, re-architect, and redeploy a functional website based on the 1,000 pages of the old one. It took a few more hours to set up proper redirects, SEO, polishes and debugs. It was a cathartic - albeit scary - experiment to think that we were about to essentially erase six years of a relationship with a toolset in a single afternoon.\n\nA new and unexpected benefit of this shift is the cultural change within the team. Moving even less technical team members toward a technical stack consisting of version control, IDEs, and CLIs forces them to engage with the tools that our engineering team uses every day.\n\nThis lowers the \"understanding gap\" between teams. Everyone is now speaking a more common language. While the depth of knowledge may differ, it provides a starting point for collaboration.\n\nSome of the benefits we actually found can be summed up in this table:\n\nGaining full control over our code also meant we could no longer blame anyone when things looked wrong. And things looked very wrong. It did seem like it didn't work, at all, a massive loss of 80% of the traffic was registering on all analytics.\n\nQuite honestly, it was a terrible couple of weeks wondering if that was just vibe coded slop, missing content during the migration, Google penalising us, SEO schemas not being set properly, redirects not working; you name it we thought about it all day every day. The inherent nature of traffic taking time to be impacted by changes also meant; we had to be sort of patient with our assumptions.\n\nUntil a few days ago, when we had a realization; when we rebuilt the website, we thought also to rebuild the analytics and how we were tracking users.\n\nIt turns out, with our previous setup. We were tracking more visitors than we intended to. What happened is that we were not storing user information if they did not accept our terms, and so they were anonymous to us, but there were no such mechanics for Google Analytics so Google tracked them anyway.\n\nNow, with the website being rebuilt. We followed best practices; accepting cookies would directly impact whether the website would be passing user information to Google and other third party analytical tools as well as ourselves. And so, it turns out, lots of users do not want to accept cookies, and it turns out, we do not send their information to Google; we do however, have set an internal cookieless analytical tool (self-hosted in EU & no IP collection) to indeed see the traffic on our site.\n\nSo we did not lose 80% of traffic. Sorry. We did not in fact lose much traffic at all (there was a drop post-migration that now seems to recover organically). We vibe coded best practices in passing, forgot about it, scared ourselves, spent a few weeks thinking that our whole plan was a terrible idea and that we should admit defeat. Turns out it is all good.\n\nWell, any other tools that have added debt, cost, and systemic weight to the organization with obvious ones like - CRMs, marketing automation, and such. If everything is just a table somewhere, and if everything can be created bespoke in a few hours, why pay tens of thousands of euros for it? We are doing the work of setting it up, managing the data, cleaning and integration with our ecosystem anyways. The value seems to be diminishing by the hour.\n\nDoes this imply that every software company must take a hard look at their value proposition and ask themselves: \"Are we at risk of becoming commodified by tooling such as Claude?\"...\n\nWe are ourselves a software company; we are builders, and we know that we also would either benefit or suffer from the very same question; a simple prompt such as \"Please create my own feature store and MLOps platform,\" where a few hours later, the organization has its own bespoke tool. So where to draw the line?\n\nIt sits at the runtime/engine/core. What gets commoditised is the setup, the glue, the configuration and orchestration layers; things you can prompt into existence. What doesn't is the core: the API, the execution engine, the years of production edge-cases baked into a platform. You can prompt your way into connecting a feature store, configuring it, deploying pipelines on top of it; but the platform that runs them reliably at scale is not a weekend project.\n\nSo, for us, this is exactly where we are going. We aim to apply that same lesson to our own very own software platform, making it something users can operate on and build upon at the speed they can prompt. This must be the new motto for startups. Business as usual is but a prompt away from being replaced.\n\nP.S. While writing this article, the following message was sent to a colleague:\n\nThe table you see above is now actual markdown, not an image. One down, a few more to go.",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google’s latest quarterly report provided further evidence that its internet empire is withstanding an artificial intelligence shakeup that’s turning into another potential boon for the company.\n\nThe numbers released Wednesday marked Google's third consecutive quarter of digital ad growth of more than 10% from the previous year, while also posting more than 30% sales growth in its division that powers data centers for AI services.\n\nWhat drove Google's strong Q4 financial performance?\n\nWhat impact did the antitrust ruling have?\n\nHow is Google competing against AI startups?\n\nHow much is Alphabet investing in AI infrastructure?\n\nThose increases during the October-December period propelled Google’s corporate parent Alphabet Inc. well past the earnings forecasts of stock market analysts.\n\nAlphabet’s fourth-quarter profit rose 30% from the prior year to $34.5 billion, or $2.82 per share, while revenue climbed 18% to $113.8 billion.\n\nThe collective momentum of Google’s main business in search and advertising and the still-nascent AI field indicates a company born during the late 1990s internet boom is becoming even stronger during another technology phenomenon nearly 30 years later.\n\n“Search saw more usage than ever before, with AI continuing to drive an expansionary moment,\" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said.\n\nGoogle’s successful evolution has helped drive up Alphabet’s stock price nearly 60% in the past five months, giving it a $4 trillion market value. Even so, some investors are still skeptical whether Google will be able to sustain enough growth to justify the more than $300 billion that Alphabet will have spent from 2024 through the end of this year on expanding the computing capacity needed for AI features. Those worries caused Alphabet's shares to see-saw between slight gains and declines during extended trading after Wednesday's report came out.\n\nApple, also currently worth $4 trillion, thinks so highly of Google’s AI that the iPhone maker recently struck a deal to use Google’s Gemini technology in a long-delayed upgrade to its virtual assistant, Siri.\n\nGoogle is also embedding more of its Gemini AI into its long-dominant search engine, Gmail and Chrome browser as it tries to avoid complacency and being outmaneuvered by up-and-coming companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Perplexity.\n\nTo meet the challenge, Alphabet has been on a spending spree to expand its AI capacity. After pouring $91 billion into capital expenditures devoted mostly to AI, the Mountain View, California, company disclosed Wednesday that it expects to double down by spending another $175 billion to $185 billion this year. Its capital expenditure budget has ballooned from about $30 billion annually since 2022 when OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot to much acclaim, prompting Google to pull out all the stops to catch up.",

    "fullText": "Six key initiatives are highlighted, offering an insight into the future of NFC tech\n\n2 February 2026 – NFC Forum, the global standards body for Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, has today announced its latest roadmap for the development of NFC Forum Standards and its corresponding technical capabilities. New topics to be progressed over the forthcoming years include faster data rates, end-to-end application testing, and security advancements. Additionally, ongoing work will continue to evolve the NFC Wireless Charging offer, advance multipurpose tap and explore new digital key requirements.\n\nThe roadmap was collaboratively developed by the NFC Forum Board members - including representatives from Apple, Google, Huawei, Identiv, Infineon, NuCurrent, NXP Semiconductors, Sony, and ST Microelectronics - in consultation with the NFC Forum membership and industry partners to ensure anticipated market requirements are addressed.\n\nThe six key roadmap priorities include:\n\nFaster Data Rates. Exploring the potential to increase the standardized current rate at which data can be transferred between two devices by up to eight times, delivering a smoother and more responsive NFC user experience.\n\nImproving Reader Mode Interoperability. Providing end-to-end interoperability testing to confirm that new and updated applications successfully and consistently operate on NFC Forum Certified Devices, improving NFC Reader Mode reliability across all use cases.\n\nSecurity Advancements. Publishing NFC Forum’s first-ever NFC Controllers Security Profile, as well as looking to future proof NFC security protocols against Post Quantum Computing threats and strengthening NFC against relay-based attacks.\n\nWireless Power Evolution. Commencing work on the next generation of NFC Forum Wireless Charging Specifications to define device category specific profiles, support devices with multiple wireless charging receivers, and deliver higher charging power levels.\n\nMulti-Purpose Tap. Defining the technical proposals required to bring the concept of supporting several actions with a single ‘tap’ to market. This includes the ability of the NFC Reader to specify and request the specific credentials needed to perform a user action.\n\nDigital Keys. Exploring innovative new digital key experiences to ensure NFC Forum Standards support a range of industry requirements.\n\nMike McCamon, Executive Director of NFC Forum, comments: “NFC is a well-established and trusted foundational technology for countless devices and use cases across almost every market. To ensure that each of these deployments work in the seamless manner that customers expect from NFC, it is vital that the NFC Forum develops global standards that deliver true industry harmonization. Furthermore, to enable these standards to be adopted and applied at scale, it is equally important that all NFC stakeholders are aware of our plans and engage with NFC Forum in our development processes. This approach ensures future evolutions continue to align with both their current NFC use cases as well as their long-term ambitions.”\n\nNFC Forum last released a Technology Roadmap in 2023. A key element of this was increasing operating volumes and advancing its specifications to support the Digital Product Passport requirements. Both these ambitions were delivered as part of NFC Release 15 in June 2025.\n\n“For more than 20 years, NFC Forum has empowered organizations to create innovative contactless experiences backed by intuitive, reliable and consistent NFC open standards,” adds Mike. “The active engagement in the evolution of NFC technology from an ever-increasing number of industries is testament to the clear value it provides to users globally. As we accelerate across the arc of contactless towards inevitable ubiquity, we encourage discussion and welcome new contributions from across the ecosystem.”\n\nLearn more about the 2026 NFC Forum Technology Roadmap.\n\nThe Roadmap will be discussed in more detail in our upcoming webinar on February 26. Registrations are now open.",

    "fullText": "Pedro Sánchez says urgent action needed to protect children from ‘digital wild west’, drawing anger from owner of X\n\nSpain has proposed a ban on social media use by teenagers as attitudes hardened in Europe against the technology, drawing personal insults against the prime minister from Elon Musk.\n\nThe government is preparing a series of measures including a social media ban for under-16s, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said, promising to protect children from the “digital wild west” and hold tech companies responsible for hateful and harmful content.\n\nSánchez said on Tuesday that urgent action was needed because social media was a “failed state where laws are ignored and crimes are tolerated”.\n\nHe also took Musk to task for using X to “amplify disinformation” over his administration’s decision last week to regularise 500,000 undocumented workers and asylum seekers, pointing out that Musk was himself a migrant.\n\nMusk wrote on X in response: “Dirty Sánchez is a tyrant and a traitor to the people of Spain.” About an hour and a half later, he escalated his criticism, posting on X: “Sánchez is the true fascist totalitarian.”\n\nRepresentatives of Google, part of Alphabet, TikTok, Snapchat and Meta did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Spain’s proposed measures.\n\nGreece is also close to announcing a similar ban for children under 15, a senior government source said.\n\nSpain and Greece look set to join countries such as Britain and France in considering tougher stances on social media, after Australia in December became the first nation to prohibit access to such platforms for children younger than 16.\n\nGovernments and regulators worldwide are looking at the impact of children’s screen time on their development and mental wellbeing.\n\n“Our children are exposed to a space they were never meant to navigate alone … We will no longer accept that,” Sanchez said at the World Governments Summit in Dubai. “We will protect them from the digital wild west.”\n\nSpain joins five other European countries that he called the “coalition of the digitally willing” to coordinate and enforce cross-border regulation, Sanchez said, without naming the countries, set to hold their first meeting in the coming days.\n\n“We know that this is a battle that far exceeds the boundaries of any country,” he said. His office did not respond to a request for clarification.\n\nLegislation to ban children under 15 from social media is passing through France’s parliament. Britain is also considering similar measures.\n\nSpain’s proposed regulation would give parents clear backing to set limits and would ease social pressure for children worried about missing out, said Diana Diaz, director of the ANAR Foundation for at-risk children and adolescents.\n\nThe recent explosion of AI-generated content, and public outcry over reports of Musk’s Grok AI chatbot generating non-consensual sexual images, including of minors, has fuelled debate over the risks of such online content.\n\nBut there was no unanimous agreement that social media harms adolescents, said Jose Cesar Perales, a professor in experimental psychology at the University of Granada.\n\nSanchez said prosecutors would explore ways to investigate possible legal infractions by Grok, as well as by TikTok and Instagram, part of Meta.\n\nThe proposed ban would be implemented as part of a change to an existing bill on digital protection for minors being debated in parliament, a government spokesperson said.\n\nAbout 82% of people in Spain said they believed children under 14 should be banned from social media, according to an Ipsos poll on education published in August last year. That was up from 73% in 2024.",

A rotation into other parts of the market that began at the start of the year accelerated in Tuesday's session.\n\nWhile many of the top tech and AI names in the S&P 500, stocks in other sectors jumped as investors looked for better deals.

Brent crude, the international benchmark, was up 2% to about $67.50 a barrel, reflecting an 11% increase from its low in December. US oil prices were also up 2% to about $63.50 a barrel.\n\nThe major indexes sank into the red in the early afternoon, but pared the deepest losses.

    "fullText": "Minister announces Microsoft, Cisco and Adobe to help apply AI to local schools, hospitals, GPs and businesses\n\nIn 2002 Barnsley toyed with a redesign as a Tuscan hill village as it sought out a brighter post-industrial future. In 2021 it adopted the airily vague slogan “the place of possibilities”. Now it is trying a different image: Britain’s first “tech town”.\n\nThe technology secretary, Liz Kendall, has anointed the South Yorkshire community as a trailblazer for “how AI can improve everyday life” in the UK.\n\nIn the latest move in Labour’s drive to inject AI into Britain’s bloodstream, the government has announced four US tech companies – Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Adobe – have agreed to help as the council pushes to apply AI to local schools, hospitals, GPs and businesses in Barnsley, an area of South Yorkshire which has struggled with unemployment and deprivation since the coal pits closed.\n\nThe town and its 250,000 people have been chosen because they have already adopted AI faster than many places, said Sir Stephen Houghton, the Labour leader of Barnsley metropolitan borough council. His authority has been using AI assistants for the last couple of years in adult social care and children’s services, and its bin lorries have been enabled with tech to scan roads for potholes. The parcel company Evri, which has one of its largest distribution hubs in the town, has been trialling robot dogs for deliveries.\n\nBut local opposition leaders have warned rebranding Barnsley as a tech town “might seem a bit of a leap” and highlighted local anxiety about whether AI is a force for good.\n\nThe “tech town” status means residents will get free AI and digital training, businesses will be supported to adopt AI, the hospital will test AI tools for check-ins, triage and outpatient care and AI will be tested in schools and at Barnsley College, all in an effort to improve pupils’ results and teachers’ workloads.\n\n“The economic basis of Barnsley was destroyed 30 years ago,” Houghton said. “This is the biggest opportunity we have had since then. The future of the economy is going to be in technology and for Barnsley to be at the centre of that is an incredible opportunity.”\n\nBut one area of uncertainty is the role of the tech companies. Houghton said: “The council won’t be paying them. Whether the government is, we have to wait and see.”\n\nMicrosoft already has a relationship with Barnsley College and, along with Google and Cisco, is understood to be working on a pro bono basis.\n\n“If we are going to get AI to work for Britain, we need Britons and British public services that can work with AI,” Kendall said. “If we can show that AI helps young people learn, supports local businesses to be more productive, and improves public services, then we can show what’s possible for the whole country. What we learn here will shape how we roll out AI across the UK.”\n\nMinisters have faced criticism over their handling of big technology companies. Last week the government launched a national AI training programme to upskill 10 million citizens, but many of the online courses turned out to be bespoke training for customers of particular companies such as Google, others cost as much as £525 to complete and some simply promoted the merits of particular company’s approaches to AI such as one explaining Microsoft’s “responsible AI approach”.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said hundreds of courses on the AI Skills Hub are free and where payment is required it is clearly advertised. “All courses are reviewed against a common set of criteria to ensure they are relevant, high quality, and delivered by eligible organisations,” they said.\n\nMinisters have also been challenged for holding meetings with tech bosses at the rate of more than once each working day. The government insists engagement is vital to create growth and transform services.\n\n“It’s not about giving tech companies access to data they shouldn’t be having,” Houghton said. “It’s a secure programme and we are not leaving ourselves open. But this stuff is not going away. We have to make sure we are smart enough to protect people while taking advantage of the positive stuff it brings.”\n\nHannah Kitching, the leader of the council’s Liberal Democrat opposition, said investment in the town was welcome but “there is a lot of anxiety among people about the use of AI and whether it is a force for good. We know it could be but there are darker sides as well.”\n\n“[Barnsley] is still really connected to its mining past,” she said. “Younger people see the jobs and opportunities around the tech town idea but older generations perhaps don’t. There is a job to be done to get people onboard.”\n\nResidents “want the council to get the basics right”, she said. Roads were “absolutely crumbling” and in bad weather bins did not get collected, she added.",

    "fullText": "NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — There’s a chance the dreaded buzz of propellers heard on Ukrainian battlefields is coming from drones built in a country with a population of just over a million on Europe’s southeastern fringe: Cyprus.\n\nManufacturer Swarmly says there are more than 200 of its H-10 Poseidon drones helping Ukrainian artillery batteries pinpoint enemy targets on the ground in all kinds of weather, racking up more than 100,000 hours in the air over the last three years.\n\nIts 5,000-square-meter (54,000-square-foot) factory, where the whir of grinders shaping composite plastics reverberates off the walls, has become a major source of uncrewed vehicles shipped to countries such as Indonesia, Benin, Nigeria, India and Saudi Arabia, according to company officials. Most of the factory floor is reserved for uncrewed aerial vehicle manufacture. But tucked in a secure storage area is a selection of Swarmly's super-fast marine drones replete with high-definition cameras and .50-caliber machine guns.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has driven even the smallest European Union member countries to develop their home-grown, high-tech defense industries, just as necessity has made Kyiv a world leader in cutting-edge UAV technology. Many EU countries have partnered with Kyiv to develop that technology, and Ukraine’s front lines are usually their testing grounds.\n\nLike Cyprus, the Baltic countries and Denmark have revved up their domestic drone and counter-drone technology. In Greece, drones are part of a 25-billion euro ($29-billion) overhaul of its armed forces.\n\n“The example of Swarmy, as well as other important companies based in small EU countries, is a testament to the serious effort made by the private sector in Europe to innovate and build mass production capacity of defense items, including uncrewed systems,” said Federico Borsari, an expert with the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis.\n\nUAVs are reshaping warfare by offering less militarily capable countries some leverage over superior adversaries. Drones aren't going to completely replace big-ticket weaponry like tanks, artillery and warplanes, said Borsari. But they offer flexibility and bang for the buck, making them a formidable force multiplier.\n\nTake Swarmly's explosives-packed, satellite-guided Hydra marine drone. Each one costs 80,000 euros ($94,500), which means deploying a group of them to neutralize a billion-euro warship can be a bargain, said company director Gary Rafalovsky.\n\nThis sort of naval weapon taking out a much larger warship is already evidenced by Houthi attacks from Yemen, according to Fabian Hinz, a research fellow for missile technologies and UAVs at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Europe.\n\nBarriers to entry for undercapitalized companies are low, he added, because UAVs are often designed and assembled from components cheaply and readily available on the global market.\n\n“And that, of course, means that basically you don’t have to have a great industrial investment at first that you need with other military capabilities. You don’t need decades of experience in certain material sciences or these kinds of things,” Hinz said.\n\nIn Denmark, a pair of companies focusing on anti-drone devices have reported a surge in new clients, and some of the devices were to be shipped to Ukraine to assist in jamming Russian technology on the battlefield. Ukraine in September said it was partnering with Danish companies to build missile and drone components at a factory in Denmark.\n\nIn the Baltic country of Lithuania, scientists and business partners have joined forces under the name VILNIUS TECH to develop UAVs, automated mine detection and other military technologies. The state-run ammunition factory Giraite says it has increased production capacity by 50% since 2022.\n\nGreece for the first time showcased its homemade drones and counter-drone technology during a full tactical exercise in November as NATO urged Europe's defense sector to pick up the pace.\n\n“We need capabilities, equipment, real firepower and the most advanced technology,” NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte warned during a visit to Romania earlier that month. “Bring your ideas, test your ingenuity and use NATO as your test bed.”\n\nEven as drone development accelerates, Borsari cautioned that the advantages of UAVs are often tempered by numerous variables like the harsh conditions in which they sometimes fly, operators’ training and skill levels, as well as the depth of logistical support to keep them functional.\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine and the Trump administration’s mixed messages that have strained relations with NATO allies have forced European leaders to reckon with the need to become more self-reliant on defense. So the EU has made billions of euros available to encourage investment and bolster its collective deterrent capability.\n\nThat's been a boost to nations like Cyprus, which assumed the six-month EU presidency on Jan. 1. Last week, the EU’s executive arm approved financial assistance for eight members including Spain, Croatia, Portugal, Bulgaria, Belgium, Romania and Cyprus.\n\nCyprus is set to receive final approval from EU leaders for some 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in low-cost, long-term loans under the EU’s 150-billion-euro joint ($177-billion) procurement program called Security Action for Europe (SAFE).\n\nIts nascent defense industry is already made up of around 30 companies and research centers that produce technology for both civilian and military sectors, including robotics, communications networks, anti-drone systems and even satellite communications and surveillance, said Panayiotis Hadjipavlis, chief of the armaments and defense capabilities development directorate within Cyprus' Defense Ministry.\n\n“We have niche capabilities on very high-tech products and this has to be taken seriously into account,” Hadjipavlis told The Associated Press in his office, where the helmet from his fighter pilot days hung on a nearby coat rack.\n\nMajor defense industry players, he added, are among those who should take note.",

XAI was last valued at $230 billion in November, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe merger comes as the space company plans a blockbuster public offering this year that could value it at over $1.5 trillion, two people familiar with the matter said.\n\nSpaceX, xAI and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe deal further consolidates Musk's far-flung business empire and fortunes into a tighter, mutually reinforcing ecosystem – what some investors and analysts informally call the \"Muskonomy\" – which already includes Tesla, ⁠brain-chip maker Neuralink and tunnel firm the Boring Company.\n\nThe world's richest man ​has a history of merging his ventures together. Musk folded social media ​platform X into xAI through a share swap last year, giving the AI startup access to the platform’s data and distribution. In 2016, he used Tesla's stock to buy his solar-energy company SolarCity.\n\nThe ‍agreement could draw scrutiny from regulators and ⁠investors over governance, valuation and conflicts of interest given Musk's overlapping leadership roles across multiple firms, as well as the potential movement of engineers, proprietary technology and contracts between entities.",

    "description": "Quantum computing has great potential , but its main unit, the qubit, is beset by inherent stability problems. However, this new study might change that.",
    "fullText": "The idea behind quantum computing has existed for a long while now, with the primary goal being to basically create supercomputers capable of calculating intensive problems almost instantly. While we have yet to see a fully realized quantum computer that comes close to that overall vision, we have seen a lot of progress forward. One big problem that quantum computing has is getting all of the components together in a stable environment and then scaling it up without ruining that stability. The biggest problem here comes in how we approach the scaling of qubits — which are vital to how information and data are processed in quantum computers. However, a new bit of research could help change how we approach that issue by providing an entirely new way to look at scaling qubits effectively.\n\nWhile we have seen promising progress in futuristic quantum computing and algorithms, the overall scalability of quantum computing is still small, and having actual, tangible quantum computers that can solve some of our most demanding problems still feels a long way off. In fact, some research has noted that we'll need quantum computers with several million qubits to have any chance at an early commercial application. So how do we achieve that kind of scalability? Well, some believe that a surface approach might be the answer. But to fully understand how that approach will work, and what it will fix, we have to look at the problem a bit more closer.\n\nJust like a bit is the most basic unit of information in classic computers, the qubit is the most basic unit in quantum computing. It stands for quantum bit, and up until now, researchers have had an incredibly difficult time scaling it up to a point that will make quantum computing more reliable and effective.\n\nThe problem with scaling up the number of qubits needed in a quantum computer is that each physical qubit is especially fragile and susceptible to noise. This means that each of those qubits is prone to errors, and as you add more physical qubits in one place, you're going to see more noise generated around your quantum operations. As such, you'll see more quantum information degrading, and degrading faster — in even as little as microseconds, some speculate.\n\nTo help overcome these noise issues, scientists have come up with a process known as quantum error correction — which essentially aims to add in a new piece to the puzzle called logical qubits, which are intended to filter out the noise and keep the qubits and how they process information under control. However, researchers have seen somewhat limited success in how they can scale up the amount of physical and logical qubits in a quantum computer while still keeping the amount of errors below a certain threshold.\n\nIn a new study from Columbia University, researchers highlighted how they created some of the biggest quantum arrays yet by utilizing a surface approach that combines powerful lasers and optical tweezers to capture single atoms, allowing for \"unprecedented levels of control over single atoms and molecules.\" Furthermore, the success seen in this study comes directly from a new approach to creating the optical tweezer arrays, which the researchers refer to as metasurfaces. These arrays aren't made up of physical tweezers as you might think of them, of course. Instead, they are actually highly focused beams of light that are strong enough to trap small objects, such as atoms.\n\nUnlike traditional attempts to scale qubits, the metasurfaces utilize two-dimensional arrays of \"nano-meter-sized pixels\" that take a single beam of light and shape it into a uniform and unique pattern across the entire surface. The team was able to trap 1,000 strontium atoms — which can naturally function as qubits — using the method, and they say it could be scaled up to capture more. The point here is that this method of scaling allows for identical atoms across the board, which should make them more stable. The researchers say their next goal is to capture a hundred thousand atoms.\n\nNew approaches like this could further other quantum research greatly. Recently, researchers managed to achieve \"teleportation\" using quantum supercomputers. While exciting in its own right, it's ultimately just about sharing data between two computers, though — not quite the \"Beam me up, Scotty\" moment that any \"Star Trek\" fans were probably hoping for. But with more scalable quantum systems, it's impossible to say what else scientists might be able to accomplish.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "title": "Yann LeCun, an A.I. Pioneer, Warns the Tech 'Herd' Could Hit a Dead End",
    "description": "Yann LeCun helped create the technology behind today’s chatbots. Now he says many tech companies are on the wrong path to creating intelligent machines.",
    "fullText": "Throughout his 40-year career as a computer scientist, Yann LeCun has earned a reputation as one of the world’s leading experts on artificial intelligence and a man with a penchant for throwing verbal grenades.\n\nHe was one of three pioneering researchers who received the Turing Award, often called “the Nobel Prize of computing,” for their work on the technology that is now the foundation for modern A.I. For more than a decade, he also served as chief A.I. scientist at Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram.\n\nBut after leaving Meta in November, Dr. LeCun has become increasingly vocal in his criticism of Silicon Valley’s single-minded approach to building intelligent machines. He argues that the technology industry will eventually hit a dead end in its A.I. development — after years of work and hundreds of billions of dollars spent.\n\nThe reason, he said, goes back to what he has argued for years: Large language models, or L.L.M.s, the A.I. technology at the heart of popular products like ChatGPT, can get only so powerful. And companies are throwing everything they have at projects that won’t get them to their goal to make computers as smart as or even smarter than humans. More creative Chinese companies, he added, could get there first.\n\n“There is this herd effect where everyone in Silicon Valley has to work on the same thing,” he said during a recent interview from his home in Paris. “It does not leave much room for other approaches that may be much more promising in the long term.”\n\nThat critique is the latest shot in a debate that has roiled the tech industry since OpenAI sparked the A.I. boom in 2022 with the release of ChatGPT: Is it possible to create so-called artificial general intelligence or even more powerful superintelligence? And can companies get there using their current technology and concepts?\n\nFew scientists have as much history with the topic as Dr. LeCun, 65. Much of what the tech industry is trying to do now has its roots in an idea that he has nurtured since the 1970s. As a young engineering student in Paris, he embraced a concept called neural networks, even though most researchers thought the idea was hopeless.\n\nNeural networks are mathematical systems that learn skills by analyzing data. At the time, they had no practical use. But a decade later, when he was a researcher at Bell Labs, Dr. LeCun and his colleagues showed that these systems could learn to read handwriting scribbled on envelopes or personal checks.\n\nNot long after ChatGPT was released, the two researchers who received the 2018 Turing Award with Dr. LeCun warned that A.I. was growing too powerful. Those scientists even warned that the technology could threaten the future of humanity. Dr. LeCun argued that was absurd.\n\n“There was a lot of noise around the idea that A.I. systems were intrinsically dangerous and that putting them in the hands of everyone was a mistake,” he said. “But I have never believed in this.”\n\nDr. LeCun also helped push Meta and its rivals to freely share their research through academic-style papers and so-called open source technologies.\n\nAs more people said A.I. could be a threat of some sort to humans, a number of companies curtailed their open source efforts. But Meta kept going. Dr. LeCun repeatedly argued that open source was the safest path. It meant that no one company would control the technology and that anyone could use these systems to identify and fight potential risks.\n\nNow as a number of companies, including Meta, appear to be moving away from that method because they want an edge over their rivals and continue to worry about dangerous uses, Dr. LeCun is warning that American companies could lose their lead to Chinese rivals that are still using open source.\n\n“This is a disaster,” he said. “If everyone is open, the field as a whole progresses faster.”\n\nMeta’s A.I. work ran into a snag last year. After outside researchers criticized the company’s latest technology, Llama 4, and accused Meta of misrepresenting the power of the system, Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, spent billions on a new research lab dedicated to the pursuit of “superintelligence” — a hypothetical A.I. system that exceeds the powers of the human brain.\n\nSix months after the creation of the new lab, Dr. LeCun left Meta to build his own start-up, Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs, or AMI Labs.\n\nEven though his research laid the groundwork for L.L.M.s, Dr. LeCun argued that they were not the final answer to A.I. development. The problem with current systems, he said, is that they do not plan ahead. Trained solely on digital data, they do not have a way of understanding difficulties in the real world.\n\n“L.L.M.s are not a path to superintelligence or even human-level intelligence. I have said that from the beginning,” he said. “The entire industry has been L.L.M.-pilled.”\n\nDuring his last several years at Meta, Dr. LeCun worked on technology that tried to predict the outcome of its actions. That, he said, would allow A.I. to progress beyond the status quo. His new start-up will continue that work.\n\n“This type of system can plan what it is going to do,” he said. “Current systems — L.L.M.s — absolutely cannot do that.”\n\nPart of Dr. LeCun’s argument is that today’s A.I. systems make too many mistakes. As they tackle more complex tasks, he argued, mistakes pile up like cars after a collision on a highway.\n\nBut over the last several years, these systems have steadily improved. And in recent months, the latest models, which are designed to “reason” through questions, have continued to improve in areas like math, science and computer programming.\n\n“These models do make mistakes. But we have shown that a system can try many different options — in its own head, so to speak — before settling on a final answer,” said Rayan Krishnan, the chief executive of Vals AI, a company that tracks the performance of the latest A.I. technologies.\n\n“Progress is not slowing down. It has become clear that language models can take on new tasks and continue to get better at doing everything we want them to do,” he said.\n\nSubbarao Kambhampati, an Arizona State University professor who has been an A.I. researcher nearly as long as Dr. LeCun, agreed that today’s technologies don’t provide a path to true intelligence. But he also pointed out that they were increasingly useful in highly lucrative areas like computer coding. Dr. LeCun’s newer methods, he added, are unproven.\n\nFor Dr. LeCun, that is why his new company is important. The last several decades, he said, are filled with A.I. projects that seemed like a way forward but ran out of steam. And Silicon Valley is not guaranteed to be the winner in this global race.\n\n“The good ideas are coming from China,” he said. “But Silicon Valley also has a superiority complex, so it can’t imagine that good ideas can come from other places.”",

    "title": "Why Tech (&) Media is complicated – Om",
    "description": "After I published my “velocity is the new authority” essay, a reader and dear friend emailed and asked if my framework explained the fraught relationship between media and the technology …",
    "fullText": "After I published my “velocity is the new authority” essay, a reader and dear friend emailed and asked if my framework explained the fraught relationship between media and the technology ecosystem it covers. My one-word reply was “Absolutely.” And here’s why.\n\nIn “comms” across tech, startups, and the larger ecosystem, little seems to matter anymore. It’s hard to pin down anythingconcrete or meaningful. Everything is noise and nothing can be heard.\n\nMost founders (and technology companies) treat comms like a checklist: have something new, draft a story, chase press,issue a release, share it on LinkedIn and X, maybe do a podcast tour. Others skip intermediaries and go straight to their audience. That worked when media was the gatekeeper and friction was high. Building your audience and owning your channels made sense. Today, anyone can go direct, and the noise has exploded. Rising above it gets harder every day.\n\nVelocity is replacing authority as the organizing principle for information. You see it in the broken relationship between media and the technology ecosystem. The YouTube tech review I wrote about earlier highlights the core issue: access.\n\nAccess journalism is as old as media itself. These days though, it is table stakes. Not just in tech, but across all media. I didn’t play the access game, so I was not a preferred “leaker” for many technology companies. I got my stories the old-fashioned way. By being an annoying scoop hunter. It didn’t pan out often, but occasionally I got the big one. Like Microsoft buying Skype. It was a hard game to play. It’s even harder now.\n\nA few months ago, I naively asked the founder of a purportedly disruptive company for an interview. I thought it would be a great interview, as he was doing something new and interesting and worth digging into. Obviously, he didn’t respond. He didn’t have to. Maybe he was worried that an old-school reporter like me would do my homework and ask basic, but tough questions. The kind of questions that used to be standard fare, but now they get you ignored.\n\nA hundred years ago, tabloids printed whatever they were told, just to sell rags. Today it’s videos and podcasts. Don’t get me started on the “technology” ones, especially those creaming over “AI.”\n\nPodcasters need guests. To build an audience they chase boldface names. Access depends on avoiding tough questions. Press them with unflattering ones and you get a reputation. No surprise we now have podcasters acting as mouthpieces for tech companies. The “interview” becomes a promotional vehicle. The host lobs softballs and nods along with whatever narrative the guest is spinning. Both lapse into MBA-speak. It’s an Oscar-worthy performance. The line between journalism and marketing blurs.\n\nI don’t think this is an ethical failure; it’s structural. When your business model depends on downloads and views, you do what you must: keep cozy relationships with a small circle of founders, venture capitalists, and executives you’re supposed to cover critically.\n\nAI podcasts are a perfect example. You hear the same talking heads saying the same things. They’re half-bullish, half-skeptical. One side sees transformation, the other disaster. As with any technology, the truth sits somewhere in the middle. What you need is contextual skepticism, technical scrutiny, and analytic rigor. That mix doesn’t exist because the system won’t support it.\n\nThere are fewer than a dozen journalists I can name-check those who don’t disappoint. Nilay Patel of The Verge for example. There are some veterans, but only a handful are newcomers. Good technology coverage needs more.\n\nWhile building GigaOm, I knew we’d drown in pitch meetings without standards. I wrote a one-page guide for my writers covering startups. Beyond taking the time to understand their subject, I asked them to answer four questions before writing about a founder or a startup.\n\nBegin with the founders. Look past LinkedIn summaries to their actual histories. Have they built and shipped real products? Do they understand the market they claim to disrupt? Are they domain experts or opportunists chasing the latest trend? And lastly, as a form of validation, who are their financial backers?\n\nFounders were interesting only if you had enough context about the technology landscape to distinguish the novel from the incremental. You had to know whether their insight was real or just a repackaging of existing ideas with better marketing.\n\nInvestors mattered. With every deal, a firm put its reputation on the line. Their involvement signaled intent. If Sequoia or Kleiner Perkins backed a company, it meant their partners had done due diligence. The amount of capital and the stage said a lot about conviction and risk tolerance.\n\nAssessing the market opportunity amid technology trends was the hardest part and required the most expertise. You needed to understand what was technically possible,, what the market was ready for, how the cost curves looked, andwhere the ecosystem dependencies were.\n\nAll this took time. I spent years watching markets evolve, covering hundreds of companies, and seeing patterns emerge. My understanding of technology grew through conversations with people who built it. Tony Li and Pradeep Sindhu walked me through the secrets of internet routing. From Andy Bechtolsheim and Desh Deshpande, I learned the ins and outs of switching. David Huber, the man behind Ciena, introduced me to optical networks. I learned the technology and, in turn, how to ask the right questions.\n\nI was lucky. Back then, the internet didn’t move at neck-snapping speed.\n\nIn my VC role, I told founders to step back and think about why their stories mattered to anyone but themselves. I encouraged them to build real rather than transactional relationships with journalists, and to wait until they had something genuinely interesting to say instead of treating PR as a checklist.\n\nIt was good advice then, and it still is, in part, as a subset of a new approach. The system I described, where thoughtful storytelling and relationship-building mattered, required time on both sides.\n\nMuch like the rest of media, tech journalism, today relies on writers who lack the deep context to do the work well. They are young, overworked, pushed to churn, and don’t have time to spend weeks learning a market before covering it. You can’t learn on the job while filing three stories a day or recording several podcast episodes a month.\n\nAs I argued in my velocity piece, we now operate on vibes. When a firm like Andreessen Horowitz invests in everything at every stage, what does that signal? A16z’s backing no longer means what Sequoia’s meant in 2005, and a TechCrunch launch no longer means what it did in 2008. The technology ecosystem is noise. Its media outlets are just the outward expression of that noise.\n\nI just read a Bloomberg piece about a startup called Upscale, which claimed it would take on Cisco and Broadcom with AI networking gear. It has raised a truckload of money and is valued in the billions, yet the story never told me the mostbasic thing: what it actually does.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, the bastion of good financial journalism, recently spent many inches on the peccadillos of one of the founders of Thinking Machines. Thinking Machines is an AI company founded by former OpenAI employees and is now valued at $12 billion. The WSJ and a handful of other major publications covered this drama as if it were a story for the Daily Mail or Vanity Fair, yet none of them explained to readers what Thinking Machines does or why it is worth $12 billion. What is its technological edge? You know, the basic financial and technological questions most readers need forcontext.\n\nThis isn’t the first time I’ve seen empty stories dominate. In the late 1990s, the dot-com boom launched a wave of new publications, staffed by new writers. They reported fluff: financings, concepts, hires, and parties. The hard part was covering the technology and the financial realities.\n\nWe built systems that reward acceleration, and we act surprised when everything feels rushed, shallow, a little manic. The algorithm doesn’t care if something is true. It cares if it moves. Nothing moves like titillation, gossip, and startup psychodrama.\n\nTo see what works in this environment, look at Sam Altman and OpenAI.\n\nSam is everywhere. Always in the media, always talking. What matters is that he’s in the conversation. People are talking about OpenAI, about him, about their vision for the future of AI. The objective is to make OpenAI synonymous with AI. Tighten the equation until, in people’s minds, OpenAI equals AI. That constant presence, that relentless visibility, lets him raise money at ungodly valuations. Everything else is tactics.\n\nWhat he says doesn’t have to mean anything; it’s no surprise he’s often self-contradictory.\n\nTake advertising as an example. In a talk at Harvard in October 2024, Sam said, “The idea of intermingling ads and AI is uniquely unsettling to me. I think ads were important to give the early internet a business model, but they do sort of somewhat fundamentally misalign a user’s incentives with the company providing the service. I view ads as a last-resortbusiness model.”\n\nIn fifteen months, he went from “uniquely unsettling” to “hopeful that a business model like this can work,” from “I hate ads” to ads running in ChatGPT. Anyone can connect the dots, but nobody does because the system doesn’t reward it.\n\nThe system rewards the next Sam interview. It seeks the sound bite that gets attention, gets views, picks up speed.Everyone covers Sam’s latest thoughts on AI, the future, and whatever else he wants to talk about that day.\n\nYou hardly see anybody connecting the dots and writing, “Here’s what Sam Altman said about advertising six months ago, here’s what he’s saying now, and here’s what that tells us about OpenAI’s actual business model versus its stated principles.” That story doesn’t get written because it requires someone to remember what was said six months ago, compare it to what is being said today, analyze the gap between rhetoric and reality, and ask why the gap exists and what it means for the company’s actual strategy.\n\nDon’t hate the player, play the game. Like I said, velocity trumps everything.\n\nFebruary 1, 2026, San Francisco",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Smartwatches, Oura rings, smart home devices and Fitbits being weaponised, says Refuge\n\nDomestic abusers are increasingly using AI, smartwatches and other technology to attack and control their victims, a domestic abuse charity says.\n\nRecord numbers of women who were abused and controlled through technology were referred to Refuge’s specialist services during the last three months of 2025, including a 62% increase in the most complex cases to total 829 women. There was also a 24% increase in referrals of under-30s.\n\nRecent cases included perpetrators using wearable tech such as smartwatches, Oura rings and Fitbits to track and stalk women, disrupting their lives through smart home devices that control lights and heating, and using AI spoofing apps to impersonate people.\n\nEmma Pickering, head of the tech-facilitated abuse team at Refuge, said: “Time and again, we see what happens when devices go to market without proper consideration of how they might be used to harm women and girls. It is currently far too easy for perpetrators to access and weaponise smart accessories, and our frontline teams are seeing the devastating consequences of this abuse.\n\n“It is unacceptable for the safety and wellbeing of women and girls to be treated as an afterthought once a technology has been developed and distributed. Their safety must be a foundational principle shaping both the design of wearable technology and the regulatory frameworks that surround it.”\n\nRefuge said it was far too easy to access and weaponise smart accessories and that women’s safety needed to be factored into their design.\n\nOne survivor Refuge worked with, Mina, left behind her smartwatch in a rush to flee her abuser, who then used it to track her by using linked cloud accounts to locate her emergency accommodation.\n\n“[It] was deeply shocking and frightening. I felt suddenly exposed and unsafe, knowing that my location was being tracked without my consent. It created a constant sense of paranoia; I couldn’t relax, sleep properly, or feel settled anywhere because I knew my movements weren’t private,” she said.\n\nDespite police returning the device to Mina, she was located at her next refuge by a private investigator hired by her abuser, using suspected tracking via technology. She reported the breaches to police but was told no crime had been committed because she had “not come to any harm”.\n\n“I was repeatedly asked to move for my safety, rather than the technology being dealt with directly or the smart watch being confiscated from him. Each move made me feel more unstable and displaced,” she said.\n\n“Overall, the experience left me feeling unsafe, unheard, and responsible for managing a situation that was completely out of my control. It showed me how tech abuse can quietly and powerfully extend coercive control, and how easily survivors can be left to carry the emotional and practical burden when systems don’t fully understand or respond to it.”\n\nAbusers were also increasingly using AI tools to manipulate survivors, Pickering said. For example, they might alter a video of the survivor so that she appeared drunk, enabling them to tell social services that “she’s acting erratic again, slurring speech, she’s got a drink problem” and that she was therefore an unfit mother or a risk to herself and others. “We’ll see more and more of that as these videos and applications advance,” Pickering said.\n\nPickering said she had also heard of AI tools being used to develop authentic-looking fraudulent documents, for example job offers or legal summons, which can be sent to survivors to make them believe they are in debt, or to persuade them to turn up to the same location as their abuser.\n\nPickering feared that in coming years, medical tech would increasingly be misused, for example by controlling insulin levels through a diabetes tracker, which can be fatal.\n\nShe urged the government to act on digital technology-enabled and online crimes, including providing more funding to develop and train digital investigations teams. “They want short-term wins, they don’t want to think about longer-term investment in this area, but if we don’t do that we’ll never get ahead,” she said.\n\nShe also wants to see the technology industry held to account for failing to ensure devices and platforms are designed and function in ways that are safe for vulnerable people.\n\n“Ofcom and the Online Safety Act don’t go far enough,” she said.\n\nA government spokesperson said: “Tackling violence against women and girls in all its forms, including when it takes place online or is facilitated by technology, is a top priority for this government.\n\n“Our new VAWG strategy sets out how the full power of the state will be deployed online and offline. We are working with Ofcom to set out how online platforms tackle the disproportionate abuse women and girls face online.”",

    "fullText": "The Institute for Public Policy Research also argues that tech companies must pay publishers for content they use\n\nAI-generated news should carry “nutrition” labels and tech companies must pay publishers for the content they use, according to a left-of-centre thinktank, amid rising use of the technology as a source for current affairs.\n\nThe Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said AI firms were rapidly emerging as the new “gatekeepers” of the internet and intervention was needed to create a healthy AI news environment.\n\nIt recommended standardised labels for AI-generated news, showing what information had been used to create those answers, including peer-reviewed studies and articles from professional news organisations. It also urged the establishment of a licensing regime in the UK allowing publishers to negotiate with tech companies over the use of their content in AI news.\n\n“If AI companies are going to profit from journalism and shape what the public sees, they must be required to pay fairly for the news they use and operate under clear rules that protect plurality, trust and the long-term future of independent journalism,” said Roa Powell, senior research fellow at IPPR and the report’s co-author.\n\nThe IPPR said work on licensing could begin with the UK’s competition regulator using its new enforcement powers over Google. The Competition and Markets Authority this week proposed giving web publishers and news organisations the power to stop Google scraping their content for its overviews. Collective licensing deals would ensure a wide range of publishers were included, the IPPR added.\n\nGoogle’s AI overviews now reach 2 billion users a month and approximately a quarter of people use AI to get information, according to the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.\n\n“With the right policies in place, the government can shape this market so that UK news organisations transition their business models for the AI age and AI companies improve the reliability of their products by drawing on trusted sources,” said the report.\n\nIPPR tested four AI tools – ChatGPT, Google AI overviews, Google Gemini and Perplexity – by entering 100 news-related queries into those platforms and analysing more than 2,500 links produced by the AI responses.\n\nChatGPT and Gemini did not cite journalism by the BBC, which has blocked the bots they use to assemble answers, while overviews and Perplexity used BBC content despite the broadcaster’s objections to those tools using its journalism.\n\nThe IPPR found the Telegraph, GB News, the Sun and the Daily Mail were cited in fewer than 4% of answers on ChatGPT, while the Guardian – which has a licensing deal with ChatGPT’s parent, OpenAI – was used as a source in nearly six out of 10 responses. The Financial Times, which also has a licensing deal with OpenAI, also featured highly. The Guardian was also the most common source used by Gemini, appearing in half of all answers.\n\nGoogle’s use of AI summaries at the top of search results has affected click-through traffic for publishers, with a knock-on effect for their revenues, because many users read the overview without moving on to the original journalism.\n\nThe IPPR said questions needed to be asked about how financial relationships between AI companies and news providers shaped answers.\n\n“If licensed publications appear more prominently in AI answers, there is a risk of locking out smaller and local news providers, who are less likely to get AI deals,” the report said.\n\nIPPR added that while licensing deals could replace lost advertising revenues to an extent, they would not maintain a healthy news ecosystem. They could make news organisations dependent on tech giants for revenue and that income could easily disappear if copyright protections are weakened, said the thinktank.\n\nThe IPPR said there should be public funding to create new business models for investigative news and local news, whose sustainability could be threatened by the rise of AI news, and for the BBC to “innovate with AI”.",

    "fullText": "Lord Stockwood says people in government ‘definitely’ talking about idea as technology disrupts industries\n\nThe UK could introduce a universal basic income (UBI) to protect workers in industries that are being disrupted by AI, the investment minister Jason Stockwood has said.\n\n“Bumpy” changes to society caused by the introduction of the technology would mean there would have to be “some sort of concessionary arrangement with jobs that go immediately”, Lord Stockwood said.\n\nThe Labour peer told the Financial Times: “Undoubtedly we’re going to have to think really carefully about how we soft-land those industries that go away, so some sort of [universal basic income], some sort of lifelong mechanism as well so people can retrain.”\n\nA universal basic income is not part of official government policy, but when asked whether people in government were considering the need for UBI, Stockwood told the FT: “People are definitely talking about it.”\n\nThe technology entrepreneur, who took up his ministerial post in September, said part of his motivation for joining the government was to help ensure the workforce was prepared for rapid change.\n\nFears continue to grow about the impact of artificial intelligence on Britain’s job market. This week research by the investment bank Morgan Stanley found the UK was losing more jobs than it is creating because of AI and was being hit harder than other large economies.\n\nThis month the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said AI could destroy swathes of jobs in the capital and “usher in a new era of mass unemployment”.\n\nLast week, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of the US bank JP Morgan, told the World Economic Forum in Davos that governments and businesses would have to step in to help workers whose roles were displaced by the technology, or risk civil unrest.\n\nStockwood, who held senior positions at Lastminute.com, Travelocity and Match.com, oversaw the $490m (£400m at the time) sale of the online insurance broker Simply Business to the US insurer Travelers in 2017. He later bought a stake the football club of his home town, Grimsby Town FC.\n\nWhile he has previously been a vocal proponent of a wealth tax in the UK, Stockwood told the FT he had not repeated his calls for the government to go further on taxing the rich.\n\nHowever, he added: “If you make your money and the first thing you do is you speak to a tax adviser to ask: ‘Where can we pay the lowest tax?’ we don’t want those people in this country, I’d suggest, because you’re not committed to your communities and the long-term success in this country.”\n\nStockwood was preceded as investment minister by Poppy Gustafsson, a former chief executive of the cybersecurity firm Darktrace, who stepped down after less than a year in the job.",

    "fullText": "Amazon cut 16,000 more corporate jobs on Wednesday, and leadership wants the remaining staff to become even more efficient through technology.\n\nIn an email addressing the layoffs on Wednesday, Greg Pearson, VP of global sales at Amazon Web Services, urged employees to keep using technology to streamline their work.\n\n\"Moving forward, I encourage you to keep finding ways to use technology to simplify our work, amplify our impact, and focus on the activities that directly drive value for our customers,\" Pearson wrote in the email obtained by Business Insider. \"And most importantly, take care of yourselves and each other.\"\n\nPearson's message mirrors Amazon's broader drive to run more efficiently as it reorganizes amid rapid advances in AI. Although the company initially linked the October layoffs to AI, CEO Andy Jassy later said they were driven more by cultural fit than by cost reductions or automation.\n\nJassy has previously said AI will ultimately reduce Amazon's workforce by driving efficiency gains. On Wednesday, Amazon's chief human resources officer, Beth Galetti, said in the layoff announcement that the company will continue hiring and investing in \"strategic areas.\"\n\nWednesday's layoff was Amazon's second round of mass job cuts since October, when it axed 14,000 roles.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said he would make countering immigration one of his flagship policies during his second term in the White House, promising an unprecedented number of deportations.\n\nA year in, data shows that deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection have surpassed at least 350,000 people.\n\nICE has taken center stage in Trump’s mass removal campaign, raiding homes, workplaces, and public parks in search of undocumented people, prompting widespread protests and resistance from communities across the United States.\n\nICE uses several technologies to identify and surveil individuals. Homeland Security has also leveraged the shadow of Trump’s deportations to challenge long-standing legal norms, including forcibly entering homes to arrest people without a judicial warrant, a move that legal experts say violates the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nHere are some of the technologies that ICE is relying on.\n\nICE has a technology known as cell-site simulators to snoop on cellphones. These surveillance devices, as the name suggests, are designed to appear as a cellphone tower, tricking nearby phones into connecting to them. Once that happens, the law enforcement authorities who are using the cell-site simulators can locate and identify the phones in their vicinity, and potentially intercept calls, text messages, and internet traffic.\n\nCell-site simulators are also known as “stingrays,” based on the brand name of one of the earliest versions of the technology, which was made by U.S. defense contractor Harris (now L3Harris); or IMSI catchers, a technology that can capture a nearby cell phone’s unique identifier, which law enforcement can use for identifying the phone’s owner.\n\nIn the last two years, ICE has signed contracts for more than $1.5 million with a company called TechOps Specialty Vehicles (TOSV), which produces customized vans for law enforcement.\n\nA contract worth more than $800,000, dated May 8, 2025, said TOSV will provide “Cell Site Simulator (CSS) Vehicles to support the Homeland Security Technical Operations program.”\n\nTOSV president Jon Brianas told TechCrunch that the company does not manufacture the cell-site simulators, but rather integrates them “into our overall design of the vehicle.”\n\nCell-site simulators have long been controversial for several reasons.\n\nThese devices are designed to trick all nearby phones to connect to them, which means that, by design, they gather the data of many innocent people. Also, authorities have sometimes deployed them without first obtaining a warrant.\n\nAuthorities have also tried to keep their use of the technology secret in court, withholding information and even accepting plea deals and dropping cases rather than disclose information about their use of cell-site simulators. In a court case in 2019 in Baltimore, it was revealed that prosecutors were instructed to drop cases rather than violate a non-disclosure agreement with the company that makes the devices.\n\nClearview AI is perhaps the most well-known facial-recognition company today. For years, the company promised to be able to identify any face by searching through a large database of photos it had scraped from the internet.\n\nOn Monday, 404 Media reported that ICE has signed a contract with the company to support its law enforcement arm, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), “with capabilities of identifying victims and offenders in child sexual exploitation cases and assaults against law enforcement officers.”\n\nAccording to a government procurement database, the contract signed last week is worth $3.75 million.\n\nICE has had other contracts with Clearview AI in the last couple of years. In September 2024, the agency purchased “forensic software” from the company, a deal worth $1.1 million. The year before, ICE paid Clearview AI nearly $800,000 for “facial recognition enterprise licenses.”\n\nClearview AI did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nICE is also using a facial-recognition app called Mobile Fortify, which federal agents use to identify people on the street. The app relies on scanning a person’s driver’s license photo against 200 million photos, much of the data sourced from state driver’s license databases.\n\nIn September 2024, ICE signed a contract worth $2 million with Israeli spyware maker Paragon Solutions. Almost immediately, the Biden administration issued a “stop work order,” putting the contract under review to make sure it complied with an executive order on the government’s use of commercial spyware.\n\nBecause of that order, for nearly a year, the contract remained in limbo. Then, last week, the Trump administration lifted the stop-work order, effectively reactivating the contract.\n\nAt this point, the status of Paragon’s relationship with ICE in practice is unclear.\n\nThe records entry from last week said that the contract with Paragon is for “a fully configured proprietary solution including license, hardware, warranty, maintenance, and training.” Practically speaking, unless the hardware installation and training were done last year, it may take some time for ICE to have Paragon’s system up and running.\n\nIt’s also unclear if the spyware will be used by ICE or HSI, an agency whose investigations are not limited to immigration, but also cover online child sexual exploitation, human trafficking, financial fraud, and more.\n\nParagon has long tried to portray itself as an “ethical” and responsible spyware maker, and now has to decide if it’s ethical to work with Trump’s ICE. A lot has happened to Paragon in the last year. In December, American private equity giant AE Industrial purchased Paragon, with a plan to merge it with cybersecurity company RedLattice, according to Israeli tech news site Calcalist.\n\nIn a sign that the merger may have taken place, when TechCrunch reached out to Paragon for comment on the reactivation of the ICE contract last week, we were referred to RedLattice’s new vice president of marketing and communications, Jennifer Iras.\n\nRedLattice’s Iras did not respond to a request for comment for this article, nor for last week’s article.\n\nIn the last few months, Paragon has been ensnared in a spyware scandal in Italy, where the government has been accused of spying on journalists and immigration activists. In response, Paragon cut ties with Italy’s intelligence agencies.\n\nIn mid-September, ICE’s law enforcement arm, Homeland Security Investigations, signed a contract with Magnet Forensics for $3 million.\n\nThis contract is specifically for software licenses so that HSI agents can “recover digital evidence, process multiple devices,” and “generate forensic reports,” according to the contract description.\n\nMagnet is the current maker of the phone hacking and unlocking devices known as Graykey. These devices essentially give law enforcement agents the ability to connect a locked phone to them, unlock it, and access the data inside of it.\n\nMagnet Forensics, which merged with Graykey maker Grayshift in 2023, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAt the end of September, 404 Media reported that ICE bought access to an “all-in-one” surveillance tool that allows the agency to search through databases of historical cellphone location data, as well as social media information.\n\nThe tool appears to be made of two products called Tangles and Webloc, which are made by a company called Penlink. One of the tools promises to leverage “a proprietary data platform to compile, process, and validate billions of daily location signals from hundreds of millions of mobile devices, providing both forensic and predictive analytics,” according to a redacted contract found by 404 Media.\n\nThe redacted contract does not identify which one of the tools makes that promise, but given its description, it’s likely Webloc. Forbes previously cited a case study that said Webloc can search a given location to “monitor trends of mobile devices that have given data at those locations and how often they have been there.”\n\nThis type of cellphone location data is harvested by companies around the world using software development kits (SDKs) embedded in regular smartphone apps, or with an online advertising process called real-time bidding (RTB), where companies bid in real-time to place an ad on the screen of a cellphone user based on their demographic or location data. The latter process has the by-product of giving ad tech companies that kind of personal data.\n\nOnce collected, this mass of location data is transferred to a data broker who then sells it to government agencies. Thanks to this layered process, authorities have used this type of data without getting a warrant by simply purchasing access to the data.\n\nThe other tool, Tangles, is an “AI-powered open-source intelligence” tool that automates “the search and analysis of data from the open, deep, and the dark web,” according to Penlink’s official site.\n\nForbes reported in September that ICE spent $5 million on Penlink’s two tools.\n\nPenlink did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nICE relies on automated license plate reader (ALPR) companies to follow drivers across a large swath of the U.S., noting where people go and when.\n\nICE also leans on its connections with local law enforcement agencies, which have contracts with ALPR providers, like surveillance company Flock Safety, to obtain immigration data by the back door. Flock is one of the largest ALPR providers, with over 40,000 license plate scanners around the United States, and only getting larger with its partnerships with other companies, such as video surveillance company Ring.\n\nEfforts by ICE to informally request data from local law enforcement have prompted some police departments to cut off federal agencies from their access.\n\nBorder Patrol runs its own surveillance network of ALPR cameras, the Associated Press reported.\n\nFor years, ICE has used the legal research and public records data broker LexisNexis to support its investigations.\n\nIn 2022, two non-profits obtained documents via Freedom of Information Act requests, which revealed that ICE performed more than 1.2 million searches over seven months using a tool called Accurint Virtual Crime Center. ICE used the tool to check the background information of migrants.\n\nA year later, The Intercept revealed that ICE was using LexisNexis to detect suspicious activity and investigate migrants before they even committed a crime, a program that a critic said enabled “mass surveillance.”\n\nAccording to public records, LexisNexis currently provides ICE “with a law enforcement investigative database subscription (LEIDS) which allows access to public records and commercial data to support criminal investigations.”\n\nThis year, ICE has paid $4.7 million to \n\nLexisNexis spokesperson Jennifer Richman told TechCrunch that ICE has used the company’s product “data and analytics solutions for decades, across several administrations.”\n\n“Our commitment is to support the responsible and ethical use of data, in full compliance with laws and regulations, and for the protection of all residents of the United States,” said Richman, who added that LexisNexis “partners with more than 7,500 federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial agencies across the United States to advance public safety and security.”\n\nData analytics and surveillance technology giant Palantir has signed several contracts with ICE in the last year. The biggest contract, worth $18.5 million from September 2024, is for a database system called “Investigative Case Management,” or ICM.\n\nThe contract for ICM goes back to 2022, when Palantir signed a $95.9 million deal with ICE. The Peter Thiel-founded company’s relationship with ICE dates back to the early 2010s.\n\nEarlier this year, 404 Media, which has reported extensively on the technology powering Trump’s deportation efforts, and particularly Palantir’s relationship with ICE, revealed details of how the ICM database works. The tech news site reported that it saw a recent version of the database, which allows ICE to filter people based on their immigration status, physical characteristics, criminal affiliation, location data, and more.\n\nAccording to 404 Media, “a source familiar with the database” said it is made up of ‘tables upon tables’ of data and that it can build reports that show, for example, people who are on a specific type of visa who came into the country at a specific port of entry, who came from a specific country, and who have a specific hair color (or any number of hundreds of data points).”\n\nThe tool, and Palantir’s relationship with ICE, was controversial enough that sources within the company leaked to 404 Media an internal wiki where Palantir justifies working with Trump’s ICE.\n\nPalantir is also developing a tool called “ImmigrationOS,” according to a contract worth $30 million revealed by Business Insider.\n\nImmigrationOS is said to be designed to streamline the “selection and apprehension operations of illegal aliens,” give “near real-time visibility” into self-deportations, and track people overstaying their visa, according to a document first reported on by Wired.\n\nFirst published on September 13, 2025, and updated on September 18, 2025, to include Magnet Forensics’ new contract, again on October 8, 2025, to include cell-site simulators and location data, and again on January 26, 2026, to include license plate readers.",
