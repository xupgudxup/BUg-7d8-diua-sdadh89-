    "description": "The use of generative AI in video games has been controversial to say the least, but when it comes to art, the blowback has been even stronger. One game currently being accused of using the technology is Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, as the new trailer for the fighting game's upcoming second season of DLC characters is being picked apart online. Viewers and commenters have pored over the trailer, claiming that the character designs are inconsistent and that certain visual elements contain generative AI. The biggest smoking gun, according to viewers, is a quick shot of series antagonist Geese Howard, who appears to be missing an entire foot.\nOther instances of generative AI pointed out include Blue Mary's motorcycle missing several vital components--and being a completely different model from what she normally rides--and Kim Jae Hoon having noticeably different wardrobes between his cinematic and gameplay character models.",

    "fullText": "In Mansion House speech, mayor will talk of opportunities technology offers but highlight mass unemployment risk\n\nSadiq Khan is to warn in a major speech that artificial intelligence (AI) could destroy swathes of jobs in London and “usher in a new era of mass unemployment” unless ministers act now.\n\nIn his annual Mansion House speech, the London mayor will say the capital is “at the sharpest edge of change” because of its reliance on white-collar workers in the finance and creative industries, and professional services such as law, accounting, consulting and marketing.\n\nThe mayor will argue that “we have a moral, social and economic duty to act” to ensure that new jobs are created to replace those that will disappear, with entry-level and junior jobs the first to go.\n\nIn the speech on Thursday night, Khan will highlight research that suggests 70% of skills in the average job will have changed by 2030.\n\nHowever, he also sees huge potential benefits from AI for public services and productivity across the economy.\n\nWhen he addresses business leaders and bankers at Mansion House, the London mayor will say: “AI could enable us to transform our public services, turbocharge productivity and tackle some of our most complex challenges,” but used recklessly, will “usher in a new era of mass unemployment”. He will warn that the impact on the labour market will be “nothing short of colossal”.\n\nBut he will say that there is a clear choice: “seize the potential of AI and use it as a superpower for positive transformation and creation or surrender to it and sit back and watch as it becomes a weapon of mass destruction of jobs.”\n\nCity Hall is launching a London taskforce on AI and the future of work, with expertise from the government, businesses and the AI sector, to assess the potential impact of the new technology on London’s jobs market. It will also offer free AI training for Londoners.\n\nMore than half of workers in London expect AI to affect their jobs in some way in the next 12 months, according to City Hall polling.\n\nAcross the UK, up to 3m low-skilled jobs in trades, machine operations and admin roles could disappear by 2035 because of automation and AI, a report by the charity National Foundation for Educational Research found in November.\n\n“We can shape this next technological revolution and, if we are bold in our efforts, ensure AI makes us richer, not poorer, stronger, not weaker, more connected and more confident, and more capable of building a fairer, safer and more prosperous London for everyone,” Khan will say.\n\nHe will argue the UK and others have been too slow to respond to new technology in the past and that the growth of social media has led to a youth mental health crisis, a surge in online abuse and a dangerous rise in misinformation.\n\nSeparately, Susan Langley, major of the City of London, said on Thursday morning she had noticed that some finance workers were wary of coming to London from abroad because they worry about their safety.\n\nHowever, she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The City of London is one of the safest cities in the world. There’s this perception that you’re going to step out of your office and be swept away in a tsunami of crime.\n\n“It’s completely wrong. Competition for investment is really fierce at the moment, and I think any kind of unfounded negative sentiment that’s being pushed out there really risks undermining the UK on the global stage, and we just can’t let it happen.”",

    "description": "You might have heard recently that Safari Technology Preview 234 landed the final plan for supporting masonry-style layouts in CSS.",
    "fullText": "You might have heard recently that Safari Technology Preview 234 landed the final plan for supporting masonry-style layouts in CSS. It’s called Grid Lanes.\n\nCSS Grid Lanes adds a whole new capability to CSS Grid. It lets you line up content in either columns or rows — and not both.\n\nThis layout pattern allows content of various aspect ratios to pack together. No longer do you need to truncate content artificially to make it fit. Plus, the content that’s earlier in the HTML gets grouped together towards the start of the container. If new items get lazy loaded, they appear at the end without reshuffling what’s already on screen.\n\nIt can be tricky to understand the content flow pattern as you are learning Grid Lanes. The content is not flowing down the first column to the very bottom of the container, and then back up to the top of the second column. (If you want that pattern, use CSS Multicolumn or Flexbox.)\n\nWith Grid Lanes, the content flows perpendicular to the layout shape you created. When you define columns, the content flows back and forth across those columns, just like to how it would if rows existed. If you define rows, the content will flow up and down through the rows — in the column direction, as if columns were there.\n\nHaving a way to see the order of items can make it easier to understand this content flow. Introducing the CSS Grid Lanes Inspector in Safari. It’s just the regular Grid Inspector, now with more features.\n\nSafari’s Grid Inspector already reveals the grid lines for Grid Lanes, and labels track sizes, line numbers, line names, and area names. Now it has a new feature — “Order Numbers”.\n\nYou might be tempted to believe the content order doesn’t matter. With pages like this photo gallery — most users will have no idea how the photos are ordered in the HTML. But for many users, the content order has a big impact on their experience. You should always consider what it’s like to tab through content — watching one item after another sequentially come into focus. Consider what it’s like to listen to the site through a screenreader while navigating by touch or keyboard. With Grid Lanes, you can adjust flow-tolerance to reduce the jumping around and put items where people expect.\n\nTo know which value for flow tolerance to choose, it really helps to quickly see the order of items. That makes it immediately clear how your CSS impacts the result.\n\nOrder Numbers in the Grid Inspector is an extension of a feature Safari’s Flexbox Inspector has had since Safari 16.0 — marking the order of Flex items. Seeing content order is also helpful when using the order property in Flexbox.\n\nOrder Numbers in Safari’s Grid Inspector works for CSS Grid and Subgrid, as well as Grid Lanes.\n\nThe Grid and Flexbox layout inspectors might seem similar across browsers, but the team behind Safari’s Web Inspector has taken the time to finely polish the details. In both the Grid and Flexbox Inspectors, you can simultaneously activate as many overlays as you want. No limits. And no janky scrolling due to performance struggles.\n\nSafari’s Flexbox Inspector visually distinguishes between excess free space and Flex gaps, since knowing which is which can solve confusion. It shows the boundaries of items, revealing how they are distributed both on the main axis and the cross axis of Flexbox containers. And it lists all the Flexbox containers, making it easier to understand what’s happening overall.\n\nOur Grid Inspector has a simple and clear interface, making it easy to understand the options. It also lists all Grid containers. And of course, you can change the default colors of the overlays, to best contrast with your site content.\n\nAnd Safari’s Grid and Flexbox Inspectors are the only browser devtools that label content order. We hope seeing the order of content in Grid Lanes helps you understand it more thoroughly and enjoy using this powerful new layout mechanism.\n\nOrder Numbers in Safari’s Grid Inspector shipped today in Safari Technology Preview 235. Let us know what you think. There’s still time to polish the details to make the most helpful tool possible. You can ping Jen Simmons on Bluesky or Mastodon with links, comments and ideas.",

That said, if your watch has seen better days, or it’s stopped receiving updates, then your best options are set out below.\n\nWhile several third-party smartwatches are compatible with the iPhone, they don’t offer the same level of integration that the Apple Watch does with the phone, iOS and the company’s other devices and services. It’s the best smartwatch for iPhone users, but note that you’ll need an iPhone running iOS 26 – iPhone 11 or later – to use one. The Apple Watch can’t be used with Android or as a standalone device.\n\nBest Apple Watch for most people:\nSE 3\n\nBest mid-range Apple Watch: \n\n Series 11\n\nBest Apple Watch for battery: \n\n Ultra 3\n\nI have been reviewing consumer electronics for 18 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert. In that time, I’ve seen all manner of tech fads come and go, smartphone giants rise and fall, the cutting-edge morph into the mainstream, and have poked, prodded and evaluated more than 1,000 devices – sometimes to destruction.\n\nWe conduct real-world testing of smartwatches and their various features to ensure they meet expectations and compare to their rivals.\n\nWe change the straps, poke, prod and twiddle every button, dial and setting. We wear the smartwatches day and night, seeing how they feel on the wrist, how well they fit under and with clothes, whether they catch on objects in daily life, and how well they stay put during vigorous exercise.\n\nWe test their health metrics, track various activities, and compare them for accuracy. We do everything a typical smartwatch user would, picking up notifications, installing apps, sending messages, making calls, exercising, listening to music, monitoring our health and tracking our sleep. We see how long the battery lasts in general use and while exercising, whether it’s consistent and reliable, plus how long it takes to charge.\n\nThe recently updated entry-level Apple Watch SE 3 offers almost everything its more expensive siblings do, but at a discount.\n\nIt’s light and comfortable to wear, and arrives in a choice of 40mm and 44mm case sizes. Available in either starlight or midnight aluminium, with many different strap colours and types, it should fit most wrists and styles.\n\nThe big upgrade for the SE this year is the always-on display, as well as the rapid S10 chip and 64GB of storage from the Series 11. It runs the latest watchOS 26, which comes with super-handy double-tap and wrist-flick gestures to clear notifications, alarms and scroll through your widgets hands-free. Siri runs locally, so you can quickly set timers, dictate messages and other basic features without an internet connection. And the SE 3 has all the deep integration with the iPhone that makes Apple Watches great, including Apple Pay, notifications, calls, texts, maps, photos, music control and many other features. Battery life is about one and a half days.\n\nThe SE 3 sports an older design than the current Series watch line, with chunkier bezels, a slightly smaller and dimmer screen and a 1mm thicker body, but otherwise it looks very similar to all other Apple Watches. Only those comparing them side by side are likely to spot the difference.\n\nWhile you get most of Apple’s class-leading health-tracking features, this entry-level model can’t take ECGs of your heart, record blood oxygen saturation or notify you about any potential hypertension. It still has an optical heart-rate monitor for recording throughout the day and night, though. Its skin temperature sensor allows for retrospective ovulation estimates in the cycles tracking app, too, alongside other features.\n\nIt tracks all your usual sleep, standing, steps and movement goals, and the GPS makes it a decent running and workout tracker. It supports Apple’s new AI Workout Buddy coach, but this requires an iPhone 15 Pro or later with Apple Intelligence to be carried with you on runs.\n\nNote that 5G models are available, but require a plan linked to your phone provider. And if you’re looking for a cellular-connected watch, I’d recommend the Series 11 with 5G instead.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nThe SE 3 offers all the essential bits of the Apple Watch experience, including an always-on screen, but in an older-looking body with a few more advanced health features removed. That leaves a great smartwatch for iPhone users that does most of what people want at a good price.\n\nDon’t buy if: you want ECG or hypertension alerts.\n\nRead our full Apple Watch SE 3 review: the bargain smartwatch for iPhone\n\nSize: 40/44mm\nThickness: 10.7mm\nScreen brightness: up to 1,000nits\nTested battery life: 1.5 days\nProcessor: S10\nStorage: 64GB\nWater resistance: 50 metres \nSensors: HR (2nd gen), skin temperature, GPS\n\nThe biggest, boldest and longest-lasting Apple Watch is the Ultra 3, which builds on the Series 11 with a supersized screen and body, and adds a bunch of adventure-ready features – ready for life in the wilderness, or just work in the city.\n\nIt’s available only in titanium and at 49mm, although there’s a choice of a natural or black finish. It has the biggest and brightest screen on an Apple Watch, protected by scratch-resistant sapphire crystal. Similar to the Series 11, the display is much brighter off-angle, making it easier to read at a glance.\n\nOn the inside, it’s similar to the Series 11: an S10 chip, 64GB storage, and 5G support as standard with a compatible phone plan. It runs the same watchOS 26, including the double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, but battery life is three days plus with general use. This will see you through a long weekend, or up to 14 hours of tracking workouts at the highest accuracy settings.\n\nOn the outside, the Ultra 3 has an extra action button, with which you can start a workout and light up the screen as a torch, plus other features. There’s a chunkier crown and a loudspeaker that doubles as a siren to attract attention in emergency situations. New for this year is satellite connectivity for free SOS messaging to the emergency services, if things go awry when you’re out of cellular signal range.\n\nThe Ultra 3 also has dual-band GPS, making it one of the most accurate running, cycling and sports tracking watches available. It offers a good suite of tracking metrics, plus Workout Buddy for motivation, if you carry your iPhone with you. The watch can also track dives to 40 metres’ depth and at least 22 other activities.\n\nSize-wise, it’s big for an Apple Watch – but the Ultra 3 still fits under shirt cuffs, and is relatively compact compared with adventure watch rivals from the likes of Garmin. This is a good choice should you want an Apple Watch that stands out – although it costs about twice as much as the Series 11.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nThe Ultra 3 is the biggest, boldest, longest-lasting, and most capable Apple Watch. It’s ready for daily life, workouts or the odd adventure into the wilderness.\n\nDon’t buy if: you need a compact model or have smaller wrists.\n\nRead our full Apple Watch Ultra 3 review: the biggest and best smartwatch for an iPhone\n\nSize: 49mm\nThickness: 12mm \nScreen brightness: up to 3,000nits\nTested battery life: 3 days\nProcessor: S10\nStorage: 64GB\nWater resistance: 100 metres \nSensors: HR (3rd gen), ECG, spO2, skin/water temp, depth, dual-band GPS\n\nSeries 10 \n\n The same design as the Series 11 with the same chip and screen, but with a slightly smaller battery, less scratch-resistant glass and 4G rather than 5G. Worth buying at a discount.\n\nSeries 9 \n\n Thicker and with a slightly smaller screen than the Series 10 or 11, but worth buying refurbished if you don’t want the SE 3.\n\nUltra 2 \n\n 2023’s Ultra Apple Watch was great, and is only missing a few small upgrades to screen, battery, 5G and satellite SOS compared with the current model.\n\nWearable devices can take a beating, so if your existing Apple Watch is looking a bit tired, there are things you can do. Simply cleaning out the speaker grilles and other crevices can help, as can swapping out the straps or switching up the face to make the watch look fresh.\n\nGreater damage, such as a cracked screen, can be repaired, although options are more limited than those for an iPhone. Apple charges at least £169 for such repairs; third parties can be cheaper. Having Apple replace batteries costs £95.\n\nBuying refurbished watches is a good option for the planet and your wallet. Apple’s are among the fastest and smoothest-running smartwatches available, and they are supported by software updates for about six years from release, so buying a refurbished model can save you some money.\n\nThere are two types of refurbished Apple Watch available: those that Apple refurbishes and sells as new directly, and those refurbished by third parties that are available in various grades or conditions for less.\n\nSeveral third-party retailers offer secondhand or refurbished Apple Watches, including the UK high-street chain CeX, online stores such as musicMagpie, and marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay and Back Market.\n\nMake sure you consider the condition of the watch before parting with any cash. Grading is as follows:\n\nGrade A or excellent – virtually identical to new, often with the original box and accessories, making them the most expensive.\n\nGrade B or good – in full working order but with light marks, and it may come with replacement accessories.\n\nGrade C or fair – in full working order but with obvious signs of use, and it may not come with accessories.\n\nOnce you’re satisfied with a watch’s condition, ensure you check that the strap connects properly and that the device powers up and connects to your iPhone. Then check the following:\n\nBattery health – the battery in the Apple Watch is designed to maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for 1,000 full charge cycles. Check the battery health under battery via the Settings app on the watch. Has the battery been replaced?\n\nCharging cable – the Apple Watch requires a special magnetic puck, which costs £29 on its own, to charge. Make sure an authentic, USB-C puck is included and snaps into place correctly on the back of the watch.\n\nButtons – check the buttons and digital crown are in good working order and don’t need to be pressed too hard to function.\n\nSensors – the back of the Apple Watch contains a cluster of delicate sensors. Ensure they work correctly – can you see the LEDs of the heart-rate sensor light up?\n\nSpeakers – check the speakers are free of dirt and fluff, and function correctly for Siri, alarms and calls.\n\nWifi – the Apple Watch shares wifi details with the iPhone, so fully turn off Bluetooth on your iPhone in the Settings app when in range of your home wifi to check the watch can connect properly.\n\nWater resistance – the watch needs to be properly sealed to maintain its water resistance. Has it been obviously opened, and does the refurbisher maintain the original 50-metre water resistance?\n\nWarranty – what kind of warranty and support does the refurbisher offer?\n\nAny Apple Watch Series 7 or older, as you simply won’t benefit from the software support for long before you’ll have to replace the device.\n\nFor more:\n\n The best running watches – tested\n\n The best fitness tech and gadgets, according to experts\n\nSamuel Gibbs is the Guardian’s consumer technology editor",

    "description": "\"We are at a point in history where something amazing is happening, and it may be amazingly good, and it may be amazingly bad.\"",
    "fullText": "Pioneering computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton, whose work has earned him a Nobel Prize and the moniker “godfather of AI,” said artificial intelligence will spark a surge in unemployment and profits.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with the Financial Times last year, the former Google scientist cleared the air about why he left the tech giant, raised alarms on potential threats from AI, and revealed how he uses the technology. But he also predicted who the winners and losers will be.\n\n“What’s actually going to happen is rich people are going to use AI to replace workers,” Hinton said in September. “It’s going to create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits. It will make a few people much richer and most people poorer. That’s not AI’s fault, that is the capitalist system.”\n\nThat echoed comments he gave to Fortune in August 2025, when he said AI companies are more concerned with short-term profits than the long-term consequences of the technology.\n\nLayoffs haven’t spiked, but evidence is mounting that AI is shrinking opportunities, especially at the entry level where recent college graduates start their careers.\n\nA survey from the New York Fed at the time found that companies using AI were much more likely to retrain their employees than fire them, though layoffs are expected to rise in the coming months.\n\nHinton said earlier healthcare is the one industry that will be safe from the potential jobs armageddon.\n\n“If you could make doctors five times as efficient, we could all have five times as much health care for the same price,” he explained on the Diary of a CEO YouTube series in June 2025. “There’s almost no limit to how much health care people can absorb—[patients] always want more health care if there’s no cost to it.”\n\nStill, Hinton believes jobs that perform mundane tasks will be taken over by AI, while sparing some jobs that require a high level of skill.\n\nIn his interview with the FT, he also dismissed OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s idea to pay a universal basic income as AI disrupts the economy and reduces demand for workers, saying it “won’t deal with human dignity” and the value people derive from having jobs.\n\nHinton has long warned about the dangers of AI without guardrails, estimating a 10% to 20% chance of the technology wiping out humans after the development of superintelligence.\n\nIn his view, the dangers of AI fall into two categories: the risk the technology itself poses to the future of humanity, and the consequences of AI being manipulated by people with bad intent.",

    "fullText": "Jan 12 (Reuters) - Apple will use Google's Gemini models for its revamped Siri coming later this year under a multi-year deal that deepens the tech giants' alliance in the ​artificial intelligence era and bolsters Alphabet's position in the race against OpenAI.\n\nThe deal announced Monday marks a major ‌vote of confidence for Google. Its technology already drives much of Samsung's \"Galaxy AI,\" but the Siri deal unlocks a large market with Apple's installed base ‌of more than two billion active devices.\n\n\"After careful evaluation, Apple determined Google's AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,\" Google said, adding that its models will also power other future Apple Intelligence features.\n\nAlphabet has been jostling with OpenAI for the Apple deal, the financial details of which were not disclosed.\n\nThe iPhone maker had in late 2024 rolled out ChatGPT into its ⁠devices, allowing the company's Siri voice assistant ‌to tap into the chatbot's expertise to answer complicated questions.\n\nApple said there were no major changes to the ChatGPT integration at the time, while OpenAI did not respond to Reuters' request for ‍comment.\n\n\"This seems like an unreasonable concentration of power for Google, given that (they) also have Android and Chrome,\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a post on social media platform X.\n\nMusk founded his own AI firm xAI that has been trying to compete with other major players ​in the industry by building foundational models and spending billions on massive infrastructure.\n\nMonday's tie-up will likely raise questions on OpenAI's ‌partnership with Apple. In response to Gemini 3, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman late last year reportedly issued a \"code red\" to push teams to accelerate development.\n\n\"Apple's decision to use Google's Gemini models for Siri shifts OpenAI into a more supporting role, with ChatGPT remaining positioned for complex, opt-in queries rather than the default intelligence layer,\" said Parth Talsania, CEO of Equisights Research.\n\nGoogle has been firing on all cylinders to counter OpenAI's early lead in the industry by doubling down on frontier models, and ⁠image and video generation.\n\nApple has faced a series of setbacks on the ​AI front after being late to the race, with Siri's upgrade getting ​delayed, top-level executive changes and the initial rollout of its generative AI tools being met with lukewarm reception.\n\nThe latest agreement builds on a years-long partnership that makes Google the default search engine on ‍Apple devices - a lucrative arrangement that ⁠drives traffic for Google while generating tens of billions in annual revenue for Apple.",

    "fullText": "Zurich-based firm taps into latest robot tech to ‘fibre-spray’ high-end sports shoes worn by the likes of Roger Federer\n\nA robot leg whirs around in a complex ballet as an almost invisible spray of “flying fibre” builds a hi-tech £300 sports shoe at its foot.\n\nThis nearly entirely automated process – like a sci-fi future brought to life – is part of the gameplan from On, the Swiss sports brand that is taking on the sector’s mighty champions Nike and Adidas with a mix of technology and chutzpah.\n\nThe brand is expanding rapidly after teaming up with the former tennis pro Roger Federer to create shoes suitable for the Swiss star’s sport and a mix of fashion-led collaborations including with the luxury brand LOEWE, actor Zendaya and singers FKA twigs and Burna Boy. In China, sales have doubled year-on-year. Growth has been strong in the US and mainland Europe and this month On will open its fourth London store, in Kensington.\n\n“We’re an innovation brand at heart,” says its co-founder, David Allemann, “because we are really going for the long run.”\n\nHe’s speaking from On’s Zurich head office, which has the vibe of a tech firm or luxe gym with light-filled spaces and quirky design features from the spiral staircase and workout room to a hanging fossilised tree.\n\nAllemann says the company’s inspirations are disruptors such as Apple and Dyson. These two brands were on the “mood board” when On was set up as they combine “unique design” with “innovation in terms of user-experience or technology”.\n\nAllemann, a former McKinsey consultant, ditched his job in 2010 as marketing boss of the furniture brand Vitra to start On with a former McKinsey colleague, Caspar Coppetti, and the Swiss Ironman world champion and triathlete Olivier Bernhard.\n\nBernhard’s idea was for a shoe that would protect his body from the impact of long-distance running but also promote speed. The original prototype, developed by Bernhard, an inventive individual as well as a committed sportsman, started out with sections of hose-pipe glued to the bottom of an old pair of trainers.\n\nThe three friends, all keen runners, tried out early versions together and put about £600,000 of their life savings into launching the company. They ordered 1,200 pairs of shoes, which they sold at running meets before convincing some specialist retailers to place orders.\n\nIn 2021, the trio floated the brand on the New York Stock Exchange at a value of $8bn (£5.95bn) , raising almost $750m for the business and netting them about $120m in cash while keeping a large stake in the business. This year they expect to sell 30m pairs. The brand is now worth $16bn.\n\nAfter their innovative design took off, On developed the LightSpray flying fibre technology after a team member met a young student, Johannes Voelchert, at a design fair in 2019. The company decided to fund him for a year to develop his vision, which was inspired by a glue gun used to make Halloween spider-web decorations.\n\n“We said: hey, he’s crazy, but we like that because Olivier was crazy as well,” says Allemann.\n\nVoelchert is now part of a team of hundreds of research and technology experts, from more than 90 countries and numerous industry backgrounds, helping to develop new ideas for On in Zurich with a particular eye on the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.\n\n“We call that the explorer spirit,” says Allemann.\n\nThe idea is to foster innovation and creativity so that, even as a bigger company employing 4,000 people around the world, the whole business, from designers to manufacturers, can take risks on ideas without necessarily knowing the final outcome. “We’re still able to set sail without exactly knowing where we’re arriving without calling home the next day,” Allemann says.\n\nAllemann adds that On is now seeing the benefit of “many little sprouts that now are growing up”, from its move into different sports – such as outdoor training and tennis – to its development of apparel and the opening of retail stores.\n\nThe small brand may control just 1% of the $450bn global sportswear market, according to GlobalData, but it is expanding rapidly.\n\nOn plays in the premium market with its shoes starting from about £120, excluding seasonal promotions, up to £495. That compares with Nike, which runs from £60 to £290, and Adidas, from £40 to £450.\n\nDespite high-end purchases coming under pressure from cost of living increases, sales for the brand are on track to increase by just over a third to hit nearly 3bn Swiss Francs (£2.8bn) this year. On says it has grabbed as much as a fifth of the running shoe market in the UK and other European countries.\n\nIt faces some heavyweight competition. On is just one-tenth the size of Nike, which holds about 14% of the global sportswear market, according to industry analysts GlobalData, with Adidas on 9%. However, both have faced difficulties in recent years, creating space for new challenges including On, Hoka and revitalised old brands such as New Balance or Onitsuka Tiger, now owned by ASICS.\n\nThe company also faced a class action lawsuit last year in the US, where customers claimed its shoes make a “noisy and embarrassing squeak”. Its “CloudTec” trainers, designed with holes to feel like “running on clouds” – were criticised on social media over the noise. On said it did not comment on ongoing legal matters.\n\nOn’s Cloudboom Strike LS laceless shoe, which is made by just nine robots in Zurich and costs £310, has already won the attention of running enthusiasts after the Kenyan runner Hellen Obiri won this year’s New York and last year’s Boston marathon. She also took a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics in a pair.\n\nIn Zurich, the robots in their lab-like room are still outnumbered by humans, who monitor their work and complete the final process. Most of the brand’s footwear is made in traditional factories in Asia. But this year On is aiming to open its first robot-led factory to create a more accessible version of the shoe, the upper half of which is made from a single nearly one mile-long filament of thermoplastic polyurethane in just three minutes. Traditionally, a shoe takes several humans hours of work.\n\nThe factory’s location has not yet been decided, but will be close to one of its main retail markets, with the long-term aim of producing on every continent. That would be a dramatic change from today’s industry, which is largely based in Asia, particularly Vietnam and China.\n\nAllemann says local manufacturing is attractive as it has “a huge advantage from a sustainability point of view, because you don’t have to ship shoes around the world, but also from an agility to market point of view – you can produce much faster, according to what people want”.\n\nHe says LightSpray shoes have a 75% lower CO2 footprint than an ordinary sports shoe, which plays to On’s aim to create more sustainable and recyclable kit.\n\nRetail expansion is also a big part of the story. The latest London opening will make the UK capital its biggest retail centre, with plans for as many as seven in future. It is now part of a global portfolio of 60 outlets, with plans for up to 25 more a year despite the rise of online selling.\n\n“We feel there’s still a lot of potential in retail, if done right. City centres are still a very important place for society, and shopping and sports are an important ingredient to that.”\n\nWith those in their late teens, 20s and 30s keen on sport, particularly training and running, Allemann says the shops “are not just stores but also community hubs where running clubs start”.\n\nHe believes On will continue to expand because participating in sport brings people together in a way the online world cannot.\n\n“Running and sports, that’s such an important part of your life that we see consumers are willing to invest in great performance, innovation and better feel, but also in great design and what that tells us about them.”",

    "fullText": "Robot vacuums that can climb stairs and device for BlackBerry lovers also on display at annual Las Vegas tech show\n\nThis year will be filled with robots that can fold your laundry, pick up objects and climb stairs, fridges that you can command to open by voice, laptops with screens that can follow you around the room on motorised hinges and the reimagining of the BlackBerry phone.\n\nThose are the predictions from the annual CES tech show in Las Vegas that took place this week. The sprawling event aims to showcase cutting-edge technology developed by startups and big brands.\n\nMany of these fancy developments will be available to actually buy, moving from outlandish concepts to production devices, although some are still limited to costly prototypes.\n\nThe rise of the humanoid robot continues, with the show floor filled with myriad prototypes, some of which operated autonomously rather than being remotely controlled or performing set routines this year.\n\nNot one but two different robots promised to do your laundry, make breakfast and serve drinks. In demos LG’s CLOiD home robot, which is reportedly due to undergo real-world testing next year, looked like a disembodied torso on a rolling platform, slowly and autonomously doing chores linked with various LG kitchen appliances.\n\nThe Chinese company Switchbot’s Onero H1, however, looks more like a security bot crossed with a robot vacuum with articulating arms ready to do chores. The company says it should go on sale later this year for an undisclosed sum. It joined impressive demos from many other Chinese robotics outfits, including Unitree, Booster Robotics and X-Humanoid, the recent winner of Beijing’s humanoid robot half-marathon.\n\nThis also promises to be that year that Boston Dynamics’ long-tested Atlas robot finally goes from awkward prototype to polished product, with a new design unveiled during the parent company Hyundai’s CES show.\n\nThe South Korean firm is partnering with Google’s DeepMind for robotic AI research and plans to deploy the Atlas robots, which are water resistant, can lift 50kg and automatically swap their batteries, to its manufacturing plants in the next couple of years.\n\nRobot vacuums are the more prevalent home robot for now, but even they have new tricks. Dreame’s Cyber10 Ultra arm-equipped robovac can lift up to 500g and use brushes and other nozzles while cleaning your floors. It will reportedly go on sale around August for about €1,800 (£1,560), although it was the company’s Cyber X concept with four legs and tank-like tracks that had attenders captivated because it might help it finally vanquish the mortal enemy of robot vacuums: climbing stairs.\n\nHowever, if actually cleaning the stairs is the goal, Roborock’s first two-wheel-leg robovac might be better. The Saros Rover is in development, shown off in prototype form, and can raise, lower and jump its way to each step, cleaning as it goes.\n\nNot even the humble fridge was safe this year from the march of robotics. Samsung debuted its new Family Hub fridge, which includes a screen on the front but its party piece is voice-controlled doors you can open and close hands-free.\n\nLess novel but potentially just as useful, GE built a barcode scanner into its new Profile fridge, which is designed to scan things as you discard them to automatically add them to a shopping list ready for when you need it. A camera inside the fridge lets you check remotely to see if anything’s finished or rotten.\n\nScores of new laptops were on show from all the major manufacturers including Acer, Dell, Samsung and others. But Lenovo’s Legion Pro Rollable concept was the start of the show: a regular-looking 16in laptop with a OLED screen that unrolls horizontally to a full-size 24in monitor for gaming and productivity on the go. Meanwhile, the company’s new ThinkPad Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist is going from concept to actual product with a motorised rotating hinge that automatically turns the screen to face you or your audience if you are presenting.\n\nSamsung used CES to show off its cutting-edge trifolding flexible screen Android phone-tablet hybrid, which takes the book-style folding design and adds another section that unfolds again like a pamphlet to reveal a large wide-screen tablet. Having gone on sale in South Korea just before the end of 2025 the Galaxy Z TriFold is expected to reach the US and other markets in the first half of this year for a big sum.\n\nBut for those who long for the days of physical keyboards on phones, the accessory company Clicks is bringing back the BlackBerry with its new Communicator: an Android phone with a physical keyboard. Designed as a “communication companion” with custom software that puts messaging above doomscrolling on social media, the Communicator can be used as a primary phone or as a partner to your existing iPhone or Android. It has a notification LED around the power button and a fingerprint scanner in the space bar. Reservations are open and the phone is due to ship later this year.\n\nClicks already sells keyboard cases for the iPhone, Pixel and other devices for those that don’t want to replace their phone completely with a BlackBerry. But it also had a new slide-out keyboard Bluetooth that doubles as a magnetic wireless charging battery pack on show at CES. The Power Keyboard magnetically sticks to the back of the phone and will be compatible with iPhones and Androids supporting Qi2, shipping in the spring.",

    "description": "The world's biggest technology trade show is here, and Jordan Calhoun, Beth Skwarecki, Jake Peterson, and Michelle Ehrhardt are on the ground in Las Vegas.",
    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

While CES 2026 is (predictably) being dominated by AI shoehorned into various products this week, the show still has a few surprises up its sleeve. Between iterative gaming laptop upgrades for 2026 and flashy new OLED TVs, the event is also serving as a hub for interesting and weird technology.\n\nSome of this gear--like Razer's holographic AI companion tube--is already scheduled to be released later this year, while more experimental stuff, like brain-scanning headphones, are still a long way from being seen on store shelves. In case you couldn't make it to Las Vegas this year, here's a quick look at the technology that caught our eyes.\n\nAsus and XReal have teamed up for a new set of extended reality glasses, and on paper, these have some seriously impressive tech inside. Scheduled to launch in the first half of 2026, the Asus ROG Xreal R1 features 240Hz micro-OLED 1080p lenses and a dock that lets you connect them to a console or PC via HDMI and DisplayPort.\n\nWhat's better than one 3K 16-inch OLED screen on a gaming laptop? Two 3K 16-inch OLED screens, of course. While this isn't the first time Asus has experimented with a multi-monitor display on one of its ROG laptops, this new take on the Zephyrus Duo looks like a wild approach to dual-screen gaming.\n\nHolograms make everything cooler, and Asus is leveraging this technology to create a seriously cool PC gaming case. The Asus ROG GM1000 can use its case fans to project holographic images, and users can upload their own GIFs and short MP4s to create custom effects.\n\nGameSir might be onto something, as the idea of a gaming controller with a dedicated steering wheel right in the center sounds like a fun idea. You've got all the inputs you'd require from modern gaming, a direct drive motor, and up to 65,000 levels of resolution for ultra-accurate steering, the company claims (via The Verge). Pricing and a release date have yet to be revealed.\n\nGameSir's other big controller reveal was the X5 Alteron, a Swiss Army knife of a peripheral designed for iPad, iPhone, Android, and Nintendo Switch. HyperX is helping develop it, and the modular system lets you customize the controller with various modules. This means that you can customize it extensively with different D-pads, thumbsticks, and buttons to create your dream controller.\n\nA gamepad that connects to a smartphone via its USB-C port, the 8BitDo FlipPad borrows heavily from the design of the classic Nintendo Game Boy. The company says it'll reveal more details on the Android and iOS controller ahead of its launch in Summer 2026.\n\nIt might look visually inspired by Nespresso coffee machines, but the new mid-tower case unveiled by CyberPowerPC at CES has an elegant quality. It has everything you'd expect--tempered glass panels, mesh ventilation, and ports--but the real showstopper here is a selection of knobs for controlling the LEDs on this sleek case.\n\n8BitDo makes some of the best controllers, and at CES 2026, it unveiled the 8BitDo Ultimate 3E wireless modular controller for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, Apple devices, and Android. Just don't expect this to be a budget-friendly option, as the Ultimate 3E will retail for $150 at launch in Q2 2026.\n\nIf you're a fan of Kojima Productions--the studio headed by famed game developer Hideo Kojima--then you'll want to check out these new peripherals from Asus. This special-edition hardware features hand-drawn illustrations by Yoji Shinkawa--the art director for the Death Stranding games--and it'll launch on February 4.\n\nThe newly revealed Corsair Galleon 100 SD mechanical keyboard doesn't have a numpad, but it does have a built-in Elgato Stream Deck Plus. This part of the keyboard features 12 customizable buttons, a five-inch 720 x 1280 IPS screen, and rotary dials. It launches on January 29 and it's priced at $350.\n\nRazer's Project Ava is aiming to be a holographic AI desktop companion that can fulfill several roles. From lifestyle reminders to gaming wingman, the device will come with several AI personalities and is expected to launch within the first half of 2026.\n\nWe're skeptical about this concept for a \"non-invasive\" gaming headset that supposedly improves your skills in competitive games, but at least Neurable and HyperX's protoype looks like a comfy set of brain-scanning cans.\n\nUltrawide monitors have become a popular option over the years, but laptop users can't enjoy them on the go--unless they want to lug a spare monitor around. That's where this concept for a rollable screen comes in: Lenovo is courting \"athletes who need pro-level performance\" with its gaming laptop. The screen can unfurl to 16, 21.5, and 24 inches.\n\nHyperX isn't the only company with AI-powered headphones at CES 2026, as Razer also showed off its Project Motoko concept. The idea behind this wireless headset is that it uses a ton of tech--including two 4K cameras, a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, near and far field microphones, and built-in AI--to serve a similar function to other AI wearables, like taking photos, translating foreign text, or conversing with an AI assistant.\n\nIt's not gaming tech, but this $399 ultrasonic chef's knife from Seattle Ultrasonics is the closest thing we have to owning a high-frequency blade in real life. Can it effortlessly cut through a Metal Gear mech? Probably not, but the vibrating piezoelectric ceramic crystals will let you slice through fruit and vegetables easily.\n\nWhile Nvidia didn't have a new GPU to show off this year, the company did reveal its DLSS 4.5 upscaling technology. The company claims it can dynamically boost performance in compatible games, enabling up to 240+ frames per second with path tracing on 50-series GPU cards.",

    "fullText": "Internet Watch Foundation warns Elon Musk-owned AI risks bringing sexualised imagery of children into the mainstream\n\nOnline criminals are claiming to have used Elon Musk’s Grok AI tool to create sexual imagery of children, as a child safety watchdog warned the technology risked bringing such material into the mainstream.\n\nThe UK-based Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) said users of a dark web forum boasted of using Grok Imagine to create sexualised and topless imagery of girls aged between 11 and 13. IWF analysts said the images would be considered child sexual abuse material (CSAM) under UK law.\n\nThe UK-based Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) said users of a dark web forum boasted of using Grok Imagine to create sexualised and topless imagery of girls aged between 11 and 13. IWF analysts said the images would be considered child sexual abuse material (CSAM) under UK law.\n\n“We can confirm our analysts have discovered criminal imagery of children aged between 11 and 13 which appears to have been created using the tool,” said Ngaire Alexander, the head of the IWF’s hotline, which investigates reports of CSAM from members of the public.\n\nX, Elon Musk’s social media platform, has been deluged with images of women and children whose clothes have been digitally removed by the Grok tool, sparking public outcry and condemnation from politicians.\n\nMeanwhile, on Wednesday, the House of Commons women and equalities committee said it would no longer use X for its communications, saying it was no longer appropriate to do so given preventing violence against women and girls was among its key policy areas.\n\nThe decision marks the first significant move by a Westminster organisation to exit X in response to the misuse of Grok. While the decision concerned only the committee’s account, some individual members, including the Labour chair, Sarah Owen, have already stopped using X. Another, the Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine, said she was leaving the platform, calling the images generated by Grok “the last straw”.\n\nAlexander said the imagery viewed by the IWF has been used to create even more extreme material – known as Category A, which includes penetrative sexual activity – using a different AI tool.\n\n“We are extremely concerned about the ease and speed with which people can apparently generate photo-realistic child sexual abuse material. Tools like Grok now risk bringing sexual AI imagery of children into the mainstream. That is unacceptable,” Alexander added.\n\nMusk’s xAI, which owns Grok and X, has been approached for comment.\n\nDowning Street said “all options were on the table”, including a boycott of X as ministers backed the UK regulator, Ofcom, to take action.\n\nOn Wednesday, the prime minister’s official spokesperson said: “X needs to deal with this urgently and Ofcom has our full backing to take enforcement action wherever firms are failing to protect UK users.\n\n“It already has the power to issue fines of up to billions of pounds and even stop access to a site that is violating the law.”\n\nRequests for Grok to manipulate images of women to “put her in a bikini” continued to flood in on X on Wednesday. Despite the warnings of EU and UK regulatory action, there was no evidence that the platform had installed tighter safeguards, and pictures of teenage girls continue to be stripped down digitally at the request of X users, to show them in small, revealing items of underwear, or positioned in sexually explicit poses.\n\nSome users have demanded more extreme content, asking the chatbot to decorate bikinis with swastikas, or requesting alterations to photographs of women so they appear to be victims of abuse. The chatbot has obliged by adding cigarette burns, facial bruising, and blood to some images of women.\n\nThe UK’s data watchdog – the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) – said it had contacted X and xAI “to seek clarity on the measures they have in place to comply with UK data protection law and protect individuals’ rights”, adding people have “a right to use social media knowing their personal data is being handled lawfully and with respect”.\n\nX has said it takes action against illegal content, including child sexual abuse material, “by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary”.",

    "description": "Ford announced plans to deploy eyes-off driving technology on public roads by 2028. The legacy automaker is making the tech in-house to get there.",
    "fullText": "Ford said it's developing autonomous capabilities, such as eyes-off driving, that will be ready for public roads by 2028.\n\nThe legacy automaker said in an announcement on Wednesday that it will be cheaper to develop self-driving technology in-house than to seek an outside supplier.\n\n\"Because we own the technology behind our driver assistance systems, we can deliver significantly more capability at a 30% lower cost than if we bought it from outside suppliers, which makes advanced driver assistance scalable,\" Ford announced during CES in Las Vegas.\n\nChris Morse, a spokesperson for Ford, told Business Insider that the cost is compared to \"the supplier system that we have on-road today.\" A specific supplier was not named.\n\nKey team members behind Ford's ADAS ambitions gave Business Insider a broad overview of some of the advantages of an in-house approach.\n\nSammy Omari, head of ADAS and infotainment at Ford Motor Company, said the company can have greater oversight over how the sensors are utilized and integrated into the vehicles.\n\n\"How can we now combine the information from all these sensors in the most cost-effective way to get to the highest performance?\" he said. \"These are some of the key reasons why we can get to that price point.\"\n\nPaul Costa, a former Apple employee who now leads Ford's electrical engineering team, told Business Insider that the company can reduce the number of separate computer modules inside its vehicles — an ADAS computer, an infotainment system, an audio system, and a networking computer — into one computer without having to compromise performance.\n\nCosta said Ford has \"great suppliers,\" but seeking third parties doesn't allow for integration of modules, and the size of the computers themselves is larger.\n\n\"To integrate, I can't do this with all these suppliers,\" he said. \"We need to bring this stuff in-house, and it allows for this ability to do the trifecta at once: smaller, cheaper, and higher performance.\"\n\nThere are several players in the business of licensing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) for car makers, including Nvidia, Waymo, and Wayve, among others. Ford previously announced a partnership with Mobileye in 2020 to develop its ADAS software, called BlueCruise.\n\nA spokesperson for Mobileye declined to comment.\n\nLeading EV companies in the US — namely Tesla and Rivian — have taken an in-house approach to developing their own self-driving technology. Rivian announced earlier in December that it designed its own silicon chip to power the autonomous driving computer inside its future vehicles.\n\nCosta told Business Insider that Ford isn't interested in making its own chip and the automaker is happy with its current suppliers.\n\n\"We're not interested in a TOPS war,\" Costa said, referring to a metric chipmakers commonly like to tout.\n\n\"Honestly, I don't want custom silicon,\" he later added. \"If I can get other people's volume on silicon that I need, that is good for democratization.\"",

    "description": "The 'Best of CES' award winners are official, highlighting the best new tech that CES had to offer.",
    "fullText": "In the middle of the Las Vegas Convention Center, amidst the world's largest tech trade show, an awards show was taking place. The audience included nominees ranging from large companies like Nvidia to scrappy startups introducing themselves to the world, alongside journalists, tech insiders, and enthusiasts gathering to watch the Best of CES 2026 awards. After days of scouring showroom floors, speaking with innovators about their new technologies, and deliberating for six hours, finalists and winners were chosen by experts from CNET, PCMag, Mashable, ZDNET, and Lifehacker. I had the privilege of helping to judge and present several awards, and aside from my gratitude for the experience, my takeaway was simple: There's a lot of new technology worth being excited about.\n\nCNET Group, in partnership with the Consumer Technology Association, awarded winners across 22 categories, plus a 'Best Overall' award. To qualify for a Best of CES award, a product or service had to be an official exhibitor at CES 2026 and either include a compelling new concept or idea, solve a major consumer problem, or set a new bar in performance, design, or quality. The official Best of CES 2026 winners were announced live Wednesday, Jan. 7, at 4 p.m. PT. Here are all the finalists and winners of Best of CES 2026.\n\nTombot's Jennie has been capturing hearts at CES for years, but the realistic robot puppy is finally launching in 2026. Designed to comfort seniors with dementia and help combat loneliness, Jennie is packed with sensors and motors, allowing it to move its head to look at you, raise its eyebrows, wag its tail, and bark when you ask if it wants a treat. Seniors at a memory care facility we visited loved Jennie.\n\niGuard is a smart stove shutoff that helps older adults age in place. This new version of the device uses radar to tell when a person is in the kitchen, and has a configurable five-minute grace period. It can also report to a caregiver app if your loved one didn’t show up in the kitchen to make breakfast as usual.\n\nQira is Lenovo's answer to Apple Intelligence, a hybrid AI assistant that leverages a mix of on-device processing and cloud-based models for a powerful personalized assistant that's available anywhere, even as you switch from the phone in your pocket to the laptop or tablet in your hand.\n\nNvidia is once again the talk of CES, and the biggest announcement by the world's most profitable company is the Rubin AI platform. Nvidia’s six new Rubin chips work together to reduce the costs of data processed by AI, known as tokens. That's important for big tech companies, and all of us, as AI models become more compute-intensive.\n\nThis AI wearable brings it back to basics. Users can jot down quick notes throughout their day that they don't want to forget by clicking on the button and speaking into the ring. Then, an LLM on the app will process what you said for easy access and even take actions for you.\n\nSamsung Music Studio 5 (Winner)\n\nThe Samsung Music Studio 5 houses a 4-inch woofer and dual tweeters in one of the most compelling designs we've seen in a home speaker. In addition to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, it supports the Samsung Seamless Codec for compatibility with other Samsung Galaxy ecosystem products.\n\nxMEMS Sycamore-N loudspeaker chip\n\nAs smartglasses become more mainstream, they require an audio chip that is as advanced as their AI features. The xMEMS Sycamore-N loudspeaker chip enhances the smartglasses audio experience. Based on our listening tests, they provide a high-fidelity listening experience, and at one millimeter thin, directly aid in keeping smartglasses form factors thinner and lighter.\n\nAs a part of LG's Sound Suite, the H7 Soundbar extends the usefulness of Flex Connect to any TV with an HDMI input. The soundbar looks good and it sounded great with movies. The only drawback is that you can only add LG branded Flex Connect speakers to the soundbar and not those from other brands.\n\nIntel Core Ultra 300 (Panther Lake) (Winner)\n\nIntel’s Core Ultra 300 Series “Panther Lake” platform is our winner for delivering bar-raising integrated graphics performance to the mass consumer market. The top chip offers up to 12 new “Xe3” Xe cores for (by far) the best-ever integrated graphics performance from Intel silicon, enabling graphics and gaming workloads for a huge range of portable laptop categories through 2026 and beyond.\n\nIt's all about the TOPS: The mainstream version of Qualcomm's Snapdragon X2 laptop processor family maintains the 80 trillion operations per second of the higher end X2 Elite chips. Expected in laptops starting around $800, it promises field leading NPU performance at a lower price.\n\nAMD Ryzen AI Max Plus 392, AI Max Plus 388\n\nAMD’s expanded Ryzen AI Max+ platform democratizes workstation power with the 392 and 388 models, featuring 40 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores, 60 TFLOPS of compute, and 192GB unified memory. These chips bring elite local AI and GPU-free performance to thinner, more affordable devices with a superior price-to-performance ratio.\n\nAfter developing alignment-free wireless power for two years, Willo demonstrated the ability to deliver power over the air for multiple devices simultaneously, regardless of their position or movement. This represents a breakthrough in energy technology, offering wireless charging without the need for a pad, coil, or dock.\n\nJackery's solar energy-seeking robot showed an ability to follow you around like a puppy, but its real job is to follow the sun, collecting energy with its retractable 300W solar panels. The idea is that this autonomous bot can always find the sun, and then bring you the power when you need it.\n\nA water heater that automatically generates bitcoin with daily use. It utilizes the excess heat generated from bitcoin mining to heat running water in a home, offsetting up to 80 percent of electricity and water costs with the earnings from the process. You can control and manage it with an app or web console for ease of use.\n\nLego Smart Play System (Winner)\n\nA single 2-by-8 Lego brick filled with light, sound, and proximity sensors to enable new ways to play. This little block, and the tinier snap-on tab that gives it instructions, can drive anything from lightsaber duels to board games, adding color and sound effects based on what you build and how you play.\n\nIxana's Wi-R is a chip that sends data through a hyperlocal field generated by your body. This alternative to Bluetooth and WiFi is still a concept, but it has some upsides to conventional data protocols such as less power drain and less potential for clogged signal.\n\nLenovo Legion Pro Rollable Concept (Winner)\n\nRollable OLED displays have been a thing for a couple years, but they’ve been limited to enterprise laptops, if they ever even come out. The Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable concept uses this tech to bring ultrawide gaming to a laptop for the first time. Is the future rollable? We don’t know, but either way it’d be the perfect portable battlestation.\n\nA gaming PC with multiple monitors has become the norm, and while portable monitors have been around for a while, there haven't been many ways to have this experience built-in to a laptop. The Asus Zephyrus Duo takes the multiple-display idea Asus has been playing with since the original Zephyrus Duo and expands it to something actually useful: a full second display.\n\nXreal’s AR glasses are some of the best, and now PC company ASUS is partnering with Xreal to make them better, especially for gamers. These AR glasses have everything even the pickiest player needs, giving you a virtual 171-inch screen right on your face. That screen is OLED and 1080p, but the real kicker is the 240hz refresh rate. It’s smooth big-screen gaming, on the go.\n\nThe Ecoldbrew combines a portable grinder and brewer into a compact gadget that whips up a batch of cold brew coffee in five minutes. The cleverly designed device slots onto its own thermos, but it's a common size so you can easily attach it to the top of your own thermos if you have one that you love. Slated to launch on Kickstarter soon, it starts at an affordable $99.\n\nSeattle Ultrasonics' C-200 UltraSonic Chef's Knife has a Japanese steel blade that vibrates about 30,000 times per second. Its movement is so subtle that you can't see or hear it move, but you will notice how effortlessly it slices through food without clinging to it. The C-200 retails for $399, a similar price point as other nice knives. The first batch ships this month.\n\nWe've covered our fair share of smart ovens at CES but Apecoo has boiled it down to the essentials. This compact cooker uses a camera above and scale below to ID food type and size and then deploys a precise cooking program pulled from a deep AI algorithm. Perfectly cooked steak, anyone? This machine can determine the exact thickness of meat or volume of veggies like no oven before it. The oven even recognizes multiple types of food at once and uses appropriate cooking times and temps for each. Best of all, it's about half the size of a typical smart oven.\n\nLenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 14 Aura Edition (Winner)\n\nModular laptop designs for greater serviceability and sustainability are a definite trend at CES 2026, and the latest ThinkPad X1 Carbon is the best example of it. Lenovo’s flagship business laptop introduces its Space Frame design that lets you access and replace individual parts when something breaks instead of needing to buy a new laptop.\n\nYes, it's clearly inspired by the MacBook Pro, but MSI's big, redesigned Stealth pours on the special sauce. This thin rig deploys Intel's Core Ultra 300 (Panther Lake) CPUs and GeForce graphics up to a roaring RTX 5090, alongside amped-up cooling and airflow. Plus, a new, subtler MSI design and a 240Hz Gorilla Glass panel will excite gamers and prosumer creators alike.\n\nAsus' Zenbook Duo is a niche device, but it's the most elegant expression of a dual-screen laptop we've seen yet. The 2026 Zenbook Duo has matured on its design with notable improvements from last year: thinner bezels, a more sturdy kickstand, and a better hinge. Powered with up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 386H CPU, it’s well-equipped for diverse creative workloads.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z TriFold (Winner)\n\nThe culmination of Samsung's efforts to make a sleeker and more versatile folding phone. It's a true hybrid gadget that's a standard phone when closed and opens up to a sprawling 10-inch display, making this a practical, two-in-one device that fits securely in your pocket.\n\nThe Motorola Razr Fold is a solid entry in the book-style folding phone category thanks to its large screens, clean software, and powerful cameras. Together with stylus support, it's a fine option for those who need a device that's focused on productivity\n\nThe OhSnap Mcon is a Bluetooth controller with a slide-out plate to mount your iPhone (via MagSafe) or Android phone (via magnets) for a portable gaming experience. The pocketable accessory can be used in three ways: as a mounted handheld device, a wireless gaming controller, and a docked gaming console when your phone is connected to an external monitor.\n\nCoro feels like a product that should have existed for years. It solves the problem of measuring how much your baby is eating in a simple and meaningful way. I wish it was around when my babies were young.\n\nEarflo is a medical device designed to look and work like a sippy cup for kids as young as two. When you sip from the cup, a small mask forms a seal on your nose, and with each swallow, air flows through the nose. The pressure on the nasal cavity helps releasing trapped fluid in the ear. In a peer-reviewed study, after four weeks of Earflo use, 90 percent of children did not need ear tube surgery three months later.\n\nKids and parents already spend quality time building with Lego. Now, in Lego's CES debut, the company is launching its new Smart Bricks as part of its new Smart Play platform, which brings Lego creations and characters to life. Lego Smart Brick includes a tiny chip inside that enables Legos to tell color, direction, distance, sound and more. Now Lego creations can interact with families, enabling more time together.\n\nSatellai's new collar (Satellai Collar Go) and software (Petsense AI) are proactive tools that could flag subtle behavioral shifts in your dog before they become obvious health problems. It can also warn you when your dog has left your yard, and retails for a reasonable $79.\n\nPawport launched its smart pet door in late 2025. The pet door uses ultra-wideband technology, which can detect how close your dog is to the door. That lets you customize how close your dog needs to be before the door opens, both coming in and out of the house. It also extends the collar tags’ battery life from 12 to 18 months.\n\nOne of the devices debuting is the Yumshare Daily Feast, an automatic wet cat food feeder Petkit describes as its first entry into robotic wet feeding. The unit can dispense scheduled meals over seven days while monitoring consumption through an integrated camera, and can automatically discard spoiled and leftover food.\n\nOf the many humanoid robots to have made their debut at CES 2026, it's Boston Dynamics' Atlas that stands out as the best of the bunch. The prototype version demoed at the show impressed us with its naturalistic walking gait, meanwhile the sleek product version is ready to be deployed into Hyundai manufacturing facilities from this year, where it might just be working on your next car.\n\nThe Solar Mars Bot may never make it to Mars, but it solves several problems with portable generators. It's far easier to move wherever you need and it can chase the sun without intervention.\n\nRoboTurtle is both a perfect study in biomimicry and a robot with a mission. This swimming robot is designed for environmental research and once deployed, will monitor underwater ecosystems with minimal impact on wildlife.\n\nThe Roborock Saros Rover can traverse the biggest obstacle for robot vacuums: stairs. It's the first model that can navigate to different floors on its own without the help of a separate attachment. It pulls off this feat thanks to a pair of bendable legs that it controlls independently to avoid obstacles, and it can even clean stairs as it climbs.\n\nThe Lockin V7 Max is a new smart lock that doesn't require recharging or replacing its batteries. Instead of using a removable battery, the V7 Max uses Lockin AuraCharge, an external device that you plug in approximately four meters away, sending a light beam to a receiver on the lock. The lock converts the light into energy to charge its battery.\n\nThe Robotin R2 is the first robot vacuum that can wash and dry a carpet, just like a carpet cleaner. It comes with a core module and two modular attachments that let it switch from vacuuming and mopping to carpet washing and drying. It takes about one hour to clean a 300-400 square foot room and two hours to dry. There's also an absolutely massive base station with two clean water tanks, a large dustbin and a dirty water tank.\n\nThis might save lives. A French startup has created a $200 portable device to test food samples for allergens. The startup, Allergen Alert, only had mock-up devices at CES, but it's licensing the tech from French biofirm bioMérieux. If the startup can pull off the food testing, the impact could be huge. Expect it to arrive in this year's second half.\n\nIf the name sounds familiar, it's because Pebble was the first company to popularize smartwatches in 2010s. After several company moves, the brand is back as a startup with a new lineup of affordable watches with battery life improvements and improved form factors. It also has a new AI ring.\n\nThe Nirva AI jewelry is a startup that aims to continuously learn from your real-world behavior by recording your audio throughout the day. From those recordings, it offers advice on work, relationships and everyday decision-making. Nirva positions itself as a personal AI companion, designed to understand your life as you live it. Think of it as \"audio journaling\" after a long day.\n\nClear Drop Soft Plastic Compactor (Winner)\n\nAnxious about plastic waste? Clear Drop's Soft Plastic Compactor can mash them into dense bricks to send off to be recycled into products like patio furniture. Clear Drop's product and subscription ensures none of your recycled soft plating ends up in a landfill.\n\nRoboTurtle is both a perfect study in biomimicry and a robot with a mission. This swimming robot is designed for environmental research and once deployed, will monitor underwater ecosystems with minimal impact on wildlife.\n\nCambridge Consultants Ouroboros smartwatch\n\nUshering in the new age of right-to-repair legislation is this concept smartwatch design from Cambridge Consultants. It's proof that you can make a smartwatch that allows for self repair without compromising on design or user experience.\n\nThere's plenty of talk about autonomy in cars, but Stutt brings the next-generation technology to an accessible application. The Ev1 mobility scooter can map and then navigate spaces autonomously, allowing people to get around via voice commands. It can also autocorrect manual navigation to prevent bumping into obstacles. This is the rare device that combines mobility, accessibility and autonomy, and it's hard not to be impressed.\n\nDolby Atmos adds a literal new dimension to car audio. However, not everyone can buy a new luxury car just to upgrade their listening experience. Pioneer’s Sphera receiver allows almost anyone to add Dolby Atmos via Apple CarPlay to the car they already own with the speakers already installed and immerse themselves in spatial audio.\n\nPromising huge improvements in energy density, charging speed and safety, solid state battery tech is a holy grail for electric cars, home energy, drones and a host of other applications. Donut Lab is first to market with a solid state battery in a production EV which can be found in partner Verge Motorcycles’ TS Pro Gen 2.\n\nWheelchairs are available at airports, hotels, resorts, theme parks, and cruises, but standard wheelchairs require ongoing effort, and they can struggle through difficult terrain. WheelMoves is a portable wheelchair attachment that turns any standard wheelchair into an electric one, allowing people to travel more easily wherever they are.\n\nThe Jitlife JS07i is a rideable suitcase that travelers can use to drive long distances through airports. It's the size of a standard cabin bag but carries up to 250 pounds, has a maximum speed of 8 miles per hour, and can travel six miles on a charge. Already popular overseas, rideable luggage is making its way to the US, and Jitlife is the best we tried.\n\nThe Samsung S95H is the most impressive TV we saw at CES for a number of reasons, firstly, it’s 35 percent brighter than before. Secondly, it’s a wired TV which is great for gaming, but it has a wireless option for a cleaner look and which enables more connections. Thirdly, it’s the first OLED that can show artwork from the Samsung Art Store — the S95H has anti-burn-in technology that enables it to work like a Frame TV, but with even better image quality.\n\nThe 116UXS builds on the still very new and promising RGB LED TV concept by adding even more color to the mix. Its mini-LED backlight array uses red, green, and blue LEDs, then adds a fourth sky blue (cyan) LED that Hisense says lets it cover 110 percent of the BT.2020 color range.\n\nThe W6 is LG's \"wallpaper\" TV, an OLED TV only 9mm deep that can be mounted nearly flush against a wall. It's one of LG's brightest OLEDs yet, and it's almost completely wireless thanks to its Zero Connect box you can place up to 30 feet away to send it video and its Dolby Atmos FlexConnect-powered LG Sound Suite support for building a spatial audio system around it.\n\nHaving a tiny animated girl living on a small screen inside a physical cylander case is certainly very weird. Lepro's new AI companion Ami is exactly that. Its not quite an AI assistant meant to help with actual tasks. Its an AI meant for a loney person looking for some interaction. The characters dance and gyrate inside the case and can do so at the user's request as well, upping the weirdness factor.\n\nSuck on this lollipop and listen to a song directly from your mouth to your ears using bone conduction technology, so you can \"experience music you can taste.\" I tried it out, and though you had to bite down on it a bit to hear the music, it did work. It's a weird, fun novelty item. It costs $8.99.\n\niPolish touts itself as the \"world's first digital color-changing nails.\" They take the form of press-on nails that you can individually put into a little wand to instantly change the color via a selection of over 400 shades on an app.\n\nPerimenopause affects people transitioning to menopause, and is commonly marked by symptoms such as anxiety, hot flashes, and night sweats. Peri is a wearable designed to track those symptoms, and help you make informed decisions about how to manage them — whether that's through lifestyle changes and supplements alone, or hormone replacement therapy.\n\nA majority of those who menstruate report severe period pain. This wearable neurostimulation device aims to reduce period symptoms and cramps. By attaching near the ear and delivering gentle neurostimulation, the device targets the auricular branches of the trigeminal and vagus nerves to regulate menstrual cycle symptoms and help the body return to a rested state.\n\nFood allergies are common and can cause a wide range of unpleasant symptoms. Severe reactions can be deadly. Allergen Alert is a mini, portable lab that allows you to test food for common allergens on the spot at a restaurant, school, or anywhere you dine out. A single-use pouch analyzes the food sample inserted into the device and displays results within minutes.\n\nBeatbot AquaSense X ecosystem (Winner)\n\nBeatbot has introduced the world's first self-emptying pool robot cleaner. In addition to its industry leading navigation and suction, the AquaSense x Ecosystem removes the worst chore associated with robot vacs — cleaning the debris baskets filled with soggy leaves, slime and bugs. The standalone cleaning dock empties debris into a disposable bag in a bin waiting below. Next, it rinses the internal mechanisms with fresh water fed from an attached hose, keeping the filter, debris baskets and vents clear and clean.\n\nThe Luba 3 AWD stole the show at CES 2026, easily climbing slopes up to 80 percent thanks to its four-wheel drive design. This smart mower also offers wire free navigation enhanced by LiDAR and AI vision, plus adjustable cutting heights. This attractive robot lawnmower can also overcome and avoid obstacles in your yard, from tennis balls to rogue hedgehogs.\n\nBirdfy's smart 4K hummingbird feeder has a beautiful, unique design that more closely resembles an actual flower. Most importantly, it captures slow-motion video at 120 frames per second, letting you see the flap of hummingbirds' wings as they flit through your backyard. Using AI and its 8MP camera, the Hum Bloom will identify 150 different species of avian visitors.\n\nSamsung Galazy Z Trifold (Winner)\n\nA vanguard in melding eye-catching design with genuine utility, the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold achieves CES's highest honor, Best Overall. This slim device lives up to the promise of a foldable, full size tablet-phone hybrid that's as functional as it is pocketable. Its futuristic allure and seamless practicality elevate the tech while keeping it within reach.",

    "description": "The world's biggest technology trade show is here, and Jordan Calhoun, Beth Skwarecki, Jake Peterson, and Michelle Ehrhardt are on the ground in Las Vegas.",
    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

    "description": "China on Tuesday banned exports of dual-use goods that can serve military purposes to Japan, a move that comes at time of heightened tensions between the two countries over Taiwan, a self-ruled island Beijing claims as its sovereign territory.  The Chinese commerce ministry said in a statement that exports of such items, which can serve both civilian and military purposes, to Japanese military users and all other end-users that could help enhance Japanese military power are prohibited.

    "fullText": "BEIJING (AP) — China on Tuesday banned exports of dual-use goods that can serve military purposes to Japan, a move that comes at time of heightened tensions between the two countries over Taiwan, a self-ruled island Beijing claims as its sovereign territory.\n\nThe Chinese commerce ministry said in a statement that exports of such items, which can serve both civilian and military purposes, to Japanese military users and all other end-users that could help enhance Japanese military power are prohibited.\n\nAny individual or organization that violates the rule by transferring or providing these made-in-China products to Japanese groups and people would face legal consequences, regardless of where they are from, it said.\n\nThe notice did not identify or describe specific items, but some exports — particularly in the technology sector such as drones and navigation systems — could be adapted for military use.\n\nMasaaki Kanai, the Japanese Foreign Ministry's head of Asia Oceanian affairs, “strongly protested” to Chinese deputy consul Shi Yong, according to a statement from the Japanese ministry. Kanai said a measure exclusively targeting Japan that deviates from international practice is unacceptable and demanded it be retracted.\n\nRelations between Japan and China worsened late last year after Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said its military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan.\n\nIn December, Japan said Chinese military aircraft locked radar on its fighter jets even though there was a safe distance between them. Tokyo is barreling forward with efforts to significantly boost its military capabilities to stand up to China’s growing threats by doubling annual arms spending.\n\nLast week, China launched large-scale military drills around Taiwan for two days to warn against what it calls separatist and external forces.\n\nAt that time, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi slammed both Japan and Taiwan’s “pro-independence forces.” Wang said Japan's current leaders openly challenge China’s territorial sovereignty and the postwar international order. Japan was defeated in World War II by the United States and its allies.\n\nIn his meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung in Beijing on Monday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping mentioned China’s and South Korea’s historical rivalry against Japan, calling on the two countries to “join hands to defend the fruits of victory in World War II and safeguard peace and stability in northeast Asia.”",

    "fullText": "Fifa plans to create AI-enabled 3D avatars of every player at the 2026 World Cup to enhance the tournament's semi-automated offside technology.\n\nThis will mean creating a digital scan of all 1,248 players in the 26-man squads of the 48 teams.\n\nEach player will enter a chamber to be scanned, a process that should take just one second and only needs to be done once during their pre-tournament photo shoot.\n\nFifa says the scan \"captures highly accurate body-part dimensions\" to make more accurate offside decisions.\n\nIt expects this to mean tournament officials will be able to \"track players reliably during fast or obstructed movements\" and says final decisions will be \"displayed more realistically and in a more engaging way\".\n\nThere was controversy in the Premier League earlier this season when a Newcastle goal against Manchester City was allowed to stand.\n\nRuben Dias appeared to be jumping in the semi-automated offside graphic. This did not match the television pictures of the game.\n\nFifa hopes that by taking accurate scans of each player it can improve how these decisions are shown to supporters.\n\nThe technology was tested in Fifa's Intercontinental Cup, with Flamengo and Pyramids FC players scanned ahead of their match in December.\n\nFifa announced last month it was testing new technology which can determine if the ball goes out of play before a goal is scored. It has also developed 'real-time 3D recreation' to make line-of-sight offside decisions.",

    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

Robotaxis are among the first to benefit.\n\n“Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments and explain their driving decision. It’s the foundation for safe, scalable autonomy.”\n\nNvidia has started producing a driverless car powered by its technology, the Mercedes-Benz CLA, in partnership with the German carmaker. It will be launched in the US in the coming months, followed by Europe and Asia. Huang showed a video of the car driving through San Francisco with a passenger sitting behind the steering wheel, their hands in their lap.\n\n“It drives so naturally because it learned directly from human demonstrators,” Huang said, “but in every single scenario … it tells you what it’s going to do, and it reasons about what it’s about to do.”\n\nHuang also said the company’s next generation of chips was in full production, and they could deliver five times the computing power of the company’s previous products when serving up chatbots and other AI apps.\n\nHe revealed new details about the chips, which will arrive later this year as Nvidia faces increasing competition from rivals as well as its own customers.\n\nThe Vera Rubin platform, made up of six separate Nvidia chips, is expected to debut later this year. The flagship server will contain 72 of the company’s graphics units and 36 of its new central processors.\n\nHuang showed how they could be strung together into “pods” with more than 1,000 Rubin chips and said they could improve the efficiency of generating what are known as “tokens” – the fundamental unit of AI systems – by 10 times.\n\nTo get the new performance results, Huang said the Rubin chips used a proprietary kind of data that the company hopes the wider industry will adopt.\n\nWhile Nvidia still dominates the market for training AI models, it faces far more competition – from traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices as well as customers such as Alphabet’s Google – in delivering the fruits of those products to hundreds of millions of users of chatbots and other technologies.",

    "description": "Here are the highlights from the world's largest technology trade show happening in Las Vegas, including a new Nvidia chip architecture.",
    "fullText": "The tech scene is starting the year off strong.\n\nOn January 6, the Consumer Electronics Show, the largest and most influential technology trade show, is set to kick off in Las Vegas.\n\nA CES keynote presentation of a new chip from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang already got the show started.\n\nBased on early announcements, the audience can expect novelties this year like the Sweekar AI pet that physically grows, robots that can bend backwards, and a wallpaper TV that is only 0.35 inches thick. Business Insider's Lloyd Lee is also on the scene to report on the latest autonomous vehicle technologies.\n\nFollow this post over the rest of the week to keep up with the most groundbreaking tech at the 2026 CES.\n\nOn Monday, ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show, Huang officially introduced the Vera Rubin architecture, which is now in production and expected to ramp up in volume in the second half of the year. This move follows a blockbuster year for its Blackwell chip, as demand for AI infrastructure continued to surge.\n\nIn a press briefing ahead of Huang's keynote, Dion Harris, Nvidia's senior director of HPC and AI infrastructure solutions, described Vera Rubin as \"six chips that make one AI supercomputer.\"\n\n\"Vera Rubin is designed to address this fundamental challenge that we have: The amount of computation necessary for AI is skyrocketing,\" Huang told the audience during a presentation at the CES.\n\nHuang added that compared to the Blackwell model, Rubin marks a leap in performance, with more than triple the speed, could run inference five times faster, and can deliver significantly more inference compute per watt of energy.\n\nRubin was first announced in 2024 and has been slated to replace Blackwell ever since. The early debut comes months ahead of the late-2026 timeline Nvidia had previously projected.\n\nNamed after astronomer Vera Rubin, who discovered the existence of dark matter, Nvidia said in a press release that the architecture is designed to support more complex, agent-style AI workloads, as well as more networking and data movement.\n\nThe Rubin systems are already lined up for deployment across much of the cloud industry. Nvidia said partners, including Amazon Web Services, OpenAI, Anthropic, alongside the upcoming Doudna system at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, all plan to use the new platform.\n\nThe accelerated launch comes shortly after Nvidia reported record data center revenue, up 66% from a year earlier, driven largely by demand for Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra GPUs. Those chips have become a benchmark for the current AI boom are widely seen as a test of whether spending on AI infrastructure is sustainable.\n\nHuang has previously estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion could be spent globally on AI infrastructure over the next five years. Nvidia said products and services built on the Rubin platform will begin rolling out from partners in the second half of 2026.\n\nNvidia's Huang also used his presentation to unveil Alpamayo, a new open AI model and toolset designed to bring reasoning to autonomous vehicles.\n\nHuang said that Mercedes-Benz cars powered by the system are already expected to hit the road in the first quarter of 2026.\n\n\"Our vision is that someday, every single car, every single truck, will be autonomous,\" said Huang.\n\nAlpamayo is Nvidia's first full-stack push into self-driving technology, with the goal of using vision-language-action models to handle rare and unfamiliar driving scenarios.\n\nMercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius said during the presentation that he recently tested the Nvidia-powered system on public roads and drove for more than an hour through heavy traffic.\n\n\"It feels that the car is on rails. You're just driving, and it does everything,\" Källenius said. \"If you're moving an object that weighs 4,000 pounds at 50 miles an hour, sorry is not going to cut it.\"\n\nBoston Dynamics is teaming up with Google DeepMind to integrate the Gemini AI into its humanoid robot, Atlas, and its robot dog called Spot. Unveiled with Boston Dynamics's parent company, Hyundai Motor Group, at CES on Monday, the partnership aims to let Atlas understand natural-language commands, adapt on the fly, and interact more naturally with people, with the goal of pushing the machine from lab demos into real-world work.\n\nExecutives of Boston Dynamics said in a press release that by embedding a foundation model, Atlas could move beyond preprogrammed actions to navigating unfamiliar environments and identifying and manipulating objects, all of which are core skills for manual labor.\n\n\"Atlas is going to revolutionize the way industry works,\" said CEO Robert Playter in the press release, \"And it marks the first step toward a long-term goal we have dreamed about since we were children—useful robots that can walk into our homes and help make our lives safer, more productive, and more fulfilling.\"",

    "description": "To prevent students from relying on artificial intelligence to write and do homework for them, many professors are returning to pre-technology assessments and having students finish essays in class.",
    "fullText": "Higher Education\n\n AI Nudges Syracuse Professors Back Toward Blue Books, In-Class Work\n\n To prevent students from relying on artificial intelligence to write and do homework for them, many professors are returning to pre-technology assessments and having students finish essays in class.\n\n December 23, 2025 • \n Emalyn Muzzy, syracuse.com\n\n Facebook\n\n LinkedIn\n\n Twitter\n\nPrint\n\n Email\n\n (TNS) — Oksana Korol remembers her parents telling her how they took oral exams in college. Professors would give them a problem to solve. They had 10 minutes to think it through, then explain their answer and reasoning.\n\n“That is completely AI-proof,” said Korol, a biology professor at Onondaga Community College.\n\nKorol, like countless other professors in Central New York, has had to change the way she teaches her class and assesses students’ learning due to the ballooning use of generative artificial intelligence. Many, like her, are relying on those old-school techniques to AI-proof their tests and papers.\n\nAs AI continues to push itself into our everyday lives, it has created a culture of do or die for higher education. Professors have to either adapt their classes or risk students using AI to avoid thinking through tough assignments. Universities can offer courses teaching students to think critically about AI or assume young minds already know how to ask tough questions.\n\nIf higher education as a whole does not adapt, it could be left behind as students embrace AI in their studies.\n\nAt the three largest educational institutions in Syracuse — Syracuse University, Le Moyne College and Onondaga Community College — many professors are returning to pre-technology assessments while students use AI to study in futuristic ways.\n\nOCC and SU student handbooks outline how using AI to complete entire assignments and papers is considered plagiarism or academic misconduct. Le Moyne College does not have a college-wide AI policy, although Provost Jim Hannan said the institution is starting the process to create guidance.\n\nWithout uniform guidance from school leadership, it’s often up to professors to figure out how to handle AI. Some professors spend free time teaching themselves how to wield AI in a productive manner. Others side-eye the technology.\n\nAll of them, however, must understand how it impacts their students’ learning.\n\n“We have to learn how to use (AI) first. That arms race is exhausting and overwhelming when our workloads, admittedly, are already pretty heavy,” said OCC professor Michelle Malinovsky.\n\nIN-CLASS ASSESSMENTS MAKE A RETURN\nWhen a student uses an AI prompt generator to write a research paper, there are signs the student didn’t do it themselves. Malinovsky said older AI versions used the same rhetoric model. Le Moyne English professor Ann Ryan said a student’s paper may be too clean.\n\nThere is no true way to prove a student used AI, unless the student accidentally leaves their prompt in the paper or admits to it, said Rubin.\n\nWhile there are AI detection software, most don’t work, Rubin and Malinovsky said. For that reason, SU and OCC do not recommend using the programs.\n\n“It’s incredibly inaccurate. It’s always reactionary and it causes a huge issue in terms of equity and bias,” Malinovsky said.\n\nSU, Le Moyne and OCC either encourage or require professors to decide how they want students to use AI. They each have three similar pre-made policies professors can put into their syllabuses.\n\nThe policies state that AI cannot be used under any circumstance, students can use limited AI or AI can be used freely within reason.\n\n“It’s a first step of allowing faculty to think about the use and letting students know how an individual faculty member plans to allow or not allow on assessment in the classroom,” said SU Chief Digital Officer Jeff Rubin.\n\nWith the traditional research paper becoming harder to assign, many professors are flipping the classroom. For example, Ryan has students writing in class and brainstorming with classmates.\n\n“I’m workshopping papers in class as students are writing them. Traditionally in a literature class you’d say, ‘You got a 12-page paper due in three weeks,’” Ryan said. “So what we’re doing is we’re writing papers in class.”\n\nMalinovsky, who teaches English and is also a librarian, said she has implemented similar practices. She encourages students to send pictures of handwritten assignments.\n\n“(AI) challenges professors to rethink the assessment. Perhaps if they’re worried about AI use, then bring some of that assessment back into the classroom,” Rubin said.\n\nProfessors have also started to make work more reflective. For Ryan’s class, students had to add a one-to-two page coda on how what they learned in class impacted them to their final paper. They then shared that reflection with the class.\n\nLearning assessments appear to be returning to traditional, in-person techniques. Korol said she has done away with online exams and implemented more in-class tests.\n\n“I think that we’re back to the blue books and we’re maybe going back to the oral exams,” Korol at OCC said.\n\nEven with the potential for misuse, AI can be a powerful tool if harnessed correctly. While assessments embrace older techniques, study strategies are flying forward.\n\nMultiple professors said they see students upload class slides or paste class notes into a chatbot and ask it to create study tools like a practice quiz or study questions. Anthropic , the creator of AI bot Claude,analyzed student chatsand found they also use it to troubleshoot coding problems or synthesize complex information.\n\nKorol has gone one step farther and created a prototype AI tutor, where she uploads questions for students to answer. The AI tutor knows not just the correct answer but the important ideas behind it, meaning students can express the answers in different ways.\n\n“The tutor has been specifically told not to give out the answer, and instead it’s been told to keep asking leading questions. And if you read through this conversation, you will see that the hints are getting more and more transparent as we go along,” Korol said.\n\nKorol has not yet used the tutor with students but is trying to figure out how to deploy the app for campus-wide use.\n\nTEACHING ABOUT AI\nSU is taking AI education one step further: it has begun offering classes and a minor about the impact of AI. Beginning in fall 2026, the Maxwell School of Public Affairs will offer the AI Policy minor. Classes include programming and public policy analysis.\n\nThe idea is not to teach students how to create or use AI, but rather to think critically about its real world applications, said program director Johannes Himmelreich.\n\n“AI is going to have significant social impact. This will create policy challenges that require an understanding of the technology as well as the policy analysis skills,” Himmelreich said.\n\nMalinovsky described generative AI as the “wild west.” There are no specific federal regulations on AI, with regulators instead relying on a patchwork of laws. On Dec. 11, President Donald Trump put out an executive order blocking states from creating their own regulations.\n\nHimmelreich wants students to be able to tackle topics such as how to grow AI without destroying the environment, how AI could impact warfare or if AI could be conscious enough to deserve rights.\n\nThe idea of a minor exploring AI has been under discussion since 2020, a couple years before the public explosion of generative AI.\n\n“ChatGPT wasn’t a technological surprise at all. I mean, I’ve been in demos that OpenAI gave for the older models that weren’t a chat interface. And the difference is that OpenAI changed its policy around how accessible they want the technology to be,” Himmelreich said.\n\nThinking critically about AI is a core part of Milton Santiago’s Generative AI Filmmaking class. He launched the three-credit course this past fall, teaching students how to use generative AI in filmmaking while also discussing its impact.\n\n“We can intercept a lot of the ethical and moral questions that surround these tools currently, which actually I think is probably the biggest benefit of the class,” Santiago said. “Students do have to wrestle with questions of where does creativity begin and end? What does authorship actually look like? Is the environmental impact as this technology stands today worth using the tools?”\n\nTeaching about AI is not only happening in classes or studies surrounding the topic. Malinovsky said she talks about AI a lot in her English classes. To help her students better understand why they need to do their own work, she sometimes has students do the work themselves then ask an AI chatbot to do the work. Then the students compare and discuss.\n\nAs generative AI continues to develop, faculty are learning how to use it along with students. Some, like Ryan, are skeptical of its application and try to avoid it while others, like Santiago , spend hours figuring out the best application for students.\n\n“This has shaken up what education does in a way that other technologies haven’t,” Hannan said.",

    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

    "description": "Jason Lemkin, the founder of SaaStr, the world's largest community of business-to-business executives and founders, is swapping out human workers for AI.",
    "fullText": "Jason Lemkin, known to some as the Godfather of SaaS, says the time has come to push the limits of AI in the workplace.\n\nIn practice, Lemkin, the founder of SaaStr, the world's largest community of business-to-business founders, said on Lenny's Podcast recently that this means he will stop hiring humans in his sales department.\n\nInstead, SaaStr is going all in on agents, which are commonly defined as virtual assistants that can complete tasks autonomously. They break down problems, outline plans, and take action without being prompted by a user.\n\nHe said the company now has 20 AI agents automating tasks once handled by a team of 10 sales development representatives and account executives.\n\nThat move from an entirely human workforce to an agent-based workforce was rapid.\n\nIn May, SaaStr had just one AI agent in production that it used for various digital tasks, Lemkin said. That month, though, during the SaaStr Annual — its yearly gathering of over 10,000 founders, executives, and VCs — two of its high-paid sales representatives abruptly quit.\n\nLemkin said he turned to his chief AI officer and said, \"We're done with hiring humans in sales. We're going to push the limits with agents.\"\n\nLemkin's calculus was that it just wasn't worth the cost of hiring another junior sales representative for a $150,000 a year position who would eventually quit, when he could use a loyal AI agent instead.\n\nAmelia Lerutte, SaaStr's chief AI officer, told Business Insider by email that by June, the company began ramping up the number of agents it had in production.\n\n\"We had only 1 non-core agent at the time with Delphi, but didn't go deep on 2 to 20+ until the beginning of June,\" she said. \"It was a conscious choice after their departure to reallocate some (but not all) head count spend to agents.\"\n\nAt the SaaStr office, the 10 desks that once belonged to humans on the go-to-market team are now labeled with the names of agents, like \"Quali for qualified,\" \"Arty for artisan,\" and \"Repli for Replit,\" Lemkin said.\n\nLemkin said SaaStr is training its agents on its best humans.\n\n\"Train an agent with your best person, and best script, then that agent can start to become a version of your best salesperson,\" he said.\n\nSaaStr's process is similar to how Vercel, the cloud-based platform for developers, trained a sales agent off its top performer for six weeks by documenting every step of their work, and then building an agent to mimic their process.\n\nMany companies are experimenting with AI agents, but risks remain. One of the big ones is the threat of data leaks and cybercrime.\n\n\"AI agents, in order to have their full functionality, in order to be able to access applications, often need to access the operating system or the OS level of the device on which you're running them,\" Harry Farmer, a senior researcher at the Ada Lovelace Institute, recently told Wired.\n\nAll of that access creates more potential attack points for cybercriminals.\n\nSecurity threats aside, Lemkin said that the net productivity of agents is about the same as humans. However, he said, agents are more efficient and can scale — just like software.",

    "fullText": "When manager Arne Slot and Liverpool look back at this season, a crazy January afternoon when they drew 2-2 at Fulham will go a long way to summing up their misfortunes.\n\nWith top scorer Hugo Ekitike out with a muscle issue, Liverpool's struggles were compounded when one of their former players Harry Wilson opened the scoring in a first half in which Slot's side failed to test home goalkeeper Bernd Leno.\n\nYet they equalised through a controversial Florian Wirtz goal - and looked to have snatched victory in the fourth minute of stoppage time when Cody Gakpo scored in front of the away end.\n\nHowever, late substitute Harrison Reed fired home a contender for goal of the season from 25 yards in the 97th minute as Slot's side dropped points again.\n\n\"Losing that game would have been completely unfair to us,\" said Fulham manager Marco Silva.\n\nLiverpool extended their unbeaten run to nine games, but yet again their problems were laid bare.\n\n\"If you're not part of Liverpool, you think you'd win it,\" said Slot. \"But unfortunately I've been experiencing this for months now that the first chance the other team gets leads to a goal. The second thing is that the other team scores a goal you don't expect in extra time. So, is it then a surprise?\" the Dutchman said.\n\nWhat did surprise many inside Craven Cottage was that Wirtz's equaliser was confirmed after a video assistant referee (VAR) check - despite replays suggesting he was in an offside position.\n\n\"I was sure it was offside so I didn't even celebrate,\" Wirtz told Sky Sports.\n\n\"I felt the same.

    "fullText": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin declared that the network has finally cracked blockchain’s fundamental trilemma through the combination of zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines and PeerDAS technology now running on mainnet.\n\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a decade-long technical journey that began with Buterin’s first data availability sampling commit in 2015 and early ZKEVM development around 2020.\n\n“These are not minor improvements; they are shifting Ethereum into being a fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralized network,” Buterin wrote in a post on X, describing how the protocol now delivers decentralization, consensus, and high bandwidth simultaneously, a feat previously considered impossible.\n\nButerin explained that early peer-to-peer networks faced stark limitations, with BitTorrent offering massive bandwidth and decentralization but no consensus mechanism.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin achieved decentralization and consensus at the cost of extremely low throughput due to replicated rather than distributed work.\n\nEthereum’s new architecture breaks this pattern by splitting computational work across nodes while maintaining cryptographic verification of all state transitions.\n\nZKEVMs have achieved production-quality performance, with proving times dropping from 16 minutes to 16 seconds and costs falling 45-fold, with 99% of Ethereum blocks now provable in under 10 seconds on target hardware.\n\nMeanwhile, PeerDAS enables nodes to verify data availability by sampling small portions rather than downloading entire blocks, dramatically expanding throughput without sacrificing decentralization.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation set a security-first roadmap requiring teams to achieve 128-bit provable security by the end of 2026, with intermediate milestones at 100-bit security by May 2026 and mandatory integration with the soundcalc security estimation tool by February.\n\n“If an attacker can forge a proof, they can forge anything: mint tokens from nothing, rewrite state, steal funds,” the foundation warned in December, emphasizing that performance gains cannot compromise cryptographic integrity.\n\nGeorge Kadianakis from the foundation’s cryptography team stressed the importance of securing architectures before they become moving targets.\n\n“Once teams have hit these targets and zkVM architectures stabilize, the formal verification work we’ve been investing in can reach its full potential,” he wrote, noting that recent advances in compact polynomial commitment schemes like WHIR and techniques such as JaggedPCS now make ambitious security targets achievable.",

    "fullText": "AI safety expert David Dalrymple said rapid advances could outpace efforts to control powerful systems\n\nThe world “may not have time” to prepare for the safety risks posed by cutting-edge AI systems, according to a leading figure at the UK government’s scientific research agency.\n\nDavid Dalrymple, a programme director and AI safety expert at the Aria agency, told the Guardian people should be concerned about the growing capability of the technology.\n\n“I think we should be concerned about systems that can perform all of the functions that humans perform to get things done in the world, but better,” he said. “We will be outcompeted in all of the domains that we need to be dominant in, in order to maintain control of our civilisation, society and planet.”\n\nDalrymple said there was a gap in understanding between the public sector and AI companies about the power of looming breakthroughs in the technology.\n\n“I would advise that things are moving really fast and we may not have time to get ahead of it from a safety perspective,” he said. “And it’s not science fiction to project that within five years most economically valuable tasks will be performed by machines at a higher level of quality and lower cost than by humans.”\n\nDalrymple said governments should not assume that advanced systems are reliable. Aria is publicly funded but independent from the government and directs research funding. Dalrymple is developing systems to safeguard AI’s use in critical infrastructure such as energy networks.\n\n“We can’t assume these systems are reliable. The science to do that is just not likely to materialise in time given the economic pressure. So the next best thing that we can do, which we may be able to do in time, is to control and mitigate the downsides,” he said.\n\nDescribing the consequences of technological progress getting ahead of safety as a “destabilisation of security and economy”, Dalrymple said more technical work was needed on understanding and controlling the behaviours of advanced AI systems.\n\n“Progress can be framed as destabilising and it could actually be good, which is what a lot of people at the frontier are hoping. I am working to try to make things go better but it’s very high risk and human civilisation is on the whole sleep walking into this transition.”\n\nThis month the UK government’s AI Security Institute (AISI) said the capabilities of advanced AI models were “improving rapidly” across all domains and the performance in some areas was doubling every eight months.\n\nLeading models can now complete apprentice-level tasks 50% of the time on average, up from approximately 10% of the time last year, according to the institute. AISI also found that the most advanced systems can autonomously complete tasks that would take a human expert over an hour.\n\nThe institute also tested advanced models for self-replication, a key safety concern because it involves a system spreading copies of itself to other devices and becoming harder to control. The tests showed two cutting-edge models achieving success rates of more than 60%.\n\nHowever, AISI stressed that a worst-case scenario was unlikely in a day-to-day environment, saying any attempt at self-replication was “unlikely to succeed in real-world conditions”.\n\nDalrymple believes that AI systems will be able to automate the equivalent of a full day of research and development work by late 2026, which will “result in a further acceleration of capabilities”, because the technology will be able to self-improve on the maths and computer science elements of AI development.",

    "description": "Despite the promise of alleviating the main memory bottleneck, and the existence of commercial hardware implementations, techniques for Near-Data Processing have seen relatively little real-world deployment. The idea has received renewed interest with the appearance of disaggregated or \"far\" memory, for example in the use of CXL memory pools.\n  However, we argue that the lack of a clear OS-centric abstraction of Near-Data Processing is a major barrier to adoption of the technology. Inspired by the channel controllers which interface the CPU to disk drives in mainframe systems, we propose memory channel controllers as a convenient, portable, and virtualizable abstraction of Near-Data Processing for modern disaggregated memory systems.\n  In addition to providing a clean abstraction that enables OS integration while requiring no changes to CPU architecture, memory channel controllers incorporate another key innovation: they exploit the cache coherence provided by emerging interconnects to provide a much richer programming model, with more fine-grained interaction, than has been possible with existing designs.",

This winter will be Ed's 20th year working on the iconic BBC Sport programme.\n\nContext is everything. Twenty years in the context of geology is a heartbeat, a snowflake in the blizzard of time - but change the context to the world of television and the same period represents a fifth of TV's lifespan.\n\nIn my two decades on Ski Sunday, I have witnessed huge leaps in human performance, frightening environmental changes, inspiring shifts in alpine and winter sports culture and incredible advances in technology.\n\nThe biggest (and my personal favourite) change during my tenure at Ski Sunday has been in women's sport.\n\nSki Sunday's coverage was dominated in its early years by the daring of Franz Klammer and Jean-Claude Killy, the machismo of Alberto Tomba and the aggression of Hermann Maier.\n\nBut the rise of female stars in the 21st Century has been a joy to watch. Lindsey Vonn and Mikaela Schiffrin's record-breaking careers have elevated female skiing's profile above male skiing in many countries.\n\nCloser to home my co-presenter Chemmy Alcott was a consistent top-10 campaigner in alpine and Jenny Jones, Izzy and Zoe Atkin, Charlotte Bankes, Mia Brookes and Kirsty Muir have outshone the men, claiming numerous British firsts with World Cup, World Championship and X Games titles.\n\nJenny and Izzy have both won Olympic medals and it is impossible not to dream, looking at Mia, Kirsty, Charlotte and Zoe's form, that the 2026 Winter Games in Milan in February might produce Team GB's first ever gold on snow.",

    "description": "A new country is gearing up to unveil the world's second-fastest commercial transport train, and despite their reputation with technology, it isn't Japan.",
    "fullText": "There are plenty of mistakes people make while traveling by train. Pick the cheapest ride, and you'll probably be stuck on a train moving slower than drying paint. Pick the wrong type of train, and you could be spending money faster than the blink of an eye. Knowing how to choose the right type of long-distance train is crucial, and when it comes to train systems, Asia's dominance in the sector far exceeds any other continent worldwide. China currently has the top spot for the most bullet trains, as well as the fastest, and this country will soon offer the world's second-fastest train, and no, it's not Japan.\n\nSouth Korea's government and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport just revealed on December 22 that the world's second-fastest bullet train is scheduled to join its fleet in 2030 for test operations, and expect it to be fully commercialized for the public by 2031. Capable of speeds reaching a staggering 230 miles-per-hour (370 kilometers-per-hour), the new EMU-370 train is a next generation high-speed train that's going to put South Korea on the map when it comes to bullet trains that promise lightning-fast trips.\n\nKorea Railroad Research Institute (KRRI), along with seven public and private organizations, led a national research and development program spanning the length of three years from April 2022 to December 2025, to design the highly anticipated EMU-370 train project that cost a total of 15.23 million dollars (22.5 billion Korean won). The EMU-370 was designed to have a fully functional top speed of up to 253 miles-per-hour (407 kilometers-per-hour), making the trip from Seoul to Busan in just under two hours, when typically it would take two-and-a-half hours.\n\nOne of the best places to take a day trip if you're staying in Seoul, is the coastal town of Busan, which will now be more accessible than ever. Currently, the EMU-320 (KTX-Cheongyong) is South Korea's fastest train, however the EMU-370's impressive stats speak for themselves. Set to seat 479 passengers with a two decibel reduced indoor noise level, and a motor capacity of 560 kilowatts, the EMU-370 puts out 47.4% more power to the equivalent of about 75 midsize family sedans with a sleek aerodynamic design, making it the sportscar of the train world.\n\nCurrently, China's CR450 high-speed train is in testing, with speeds reaching approximately 249 miles-per-hour (400 kilometers-per-hour), and is the world's leading passenger bullet train, which is set to launch in 2027 for commercialized public use. Other countries that have bullet trains, such as France, Germany, and Japan, who were the first to have a bullet train in 1964 called the Shinkansen, reach a top speed of approximately 200 miles-per-hour (320 kilometers-per-hour).\n\nWith technological advances in rail speeds, tracks must also naturally be upgraded. According to the head of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport's Railway Bureau, there must be significant improvements before the EMU-370 can reach full speed. Without halting operations of the railway, replacing ballast tracks with concrete tracks on some sections will be done during a four-hour period in which trains do not run. The ministry official stated they expect South Korea's high-speed rail to exceed 217 miles-per-hour (350 kilometers-per-hour) in the near future, which would secure South Korea's spot as a top player within the high-speed railway sector for years to come.\n\nReady to discover more hidden gems and expert travel tips?

    "fullText": "This presentation examines artistic practices that engage with sociotechnical systems through tactical interventions. The talk proposes art as a form of infrastructural critique and counter-technology. It also introduces a forthcoming HackLab designed to foster collaborative development of open-source tools addressing digital authoritarianism, surveillance capitalism, propaganda infrastructures, and ideological warfare.\n\nIn this talk, media artist and curator Helena Nikonole presents her work at the intersection of art, activism, and tactical technology — including interventions into surveillance systems, wearable mesh networks for off-grid communication, and AI-generated propaganda sabotage.\n\nFeaturing projects like Antiwar AI, the 868labs initiative, and the curatorial project Digital Resistance, the talk explores how art can do more than just comment on sociotechnical systems — it can interfere, infiltrate, and subvert them.\n\nThis is about prototypes as politics, networked interventions as civil disobedience, and media hacks as tools of strategic refusal. The talk asks: what happens when art stops decorating crisis and starts debugging it?\n\nThe talk will also introduce an upcoming HackLab initiative — a collaboration-in-progress that brings together artists, hackers, and activists to develop open-source tools for disruption, resilience, and collective agency — and invites potential collaborators to get involved.\n\nLicensed to the public under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\n\nThis Talk was translated into multiple languages.

    "description": "Sales executive Dave Baxter underwent 12 weeks of AI training after realizing a client knew more about the technology than he did.",
    "fullText": "A few months ago, a new client, the CEO of an oil and gas company, told me he wanted to build a data warehouse to power several AI initiatives. I could not answer his questions. He was way more knowledgeable about AI than I was.\n\nIt made me realize that if I can't articulate what AI can do for a client, I will be replaced. I needed to get well-versed in this whole AI thing.\n\nI initially signed up for an online course offered through MIT, but it was way too deep and complicated. My CEO then found a 12-week certification program called AI Business Strategy offered through Johns Hopkins University. He and I signed up, along with one of my colleagues in sales. It cost about $3,000 per person, and our company paid for it.\n\nYou had the choice of taking the classes on Saturdays or Sundays. They were live, two-hour online lectures taught by multiple teachers. Some were professors at Johns Hopkins, and others were businesspeople.\n\nIt started with a little history lesson. We learned the difference between generative and agentic AI and what LLMs are. Later, we covered topics like responsible AI, generative AI for business, and AI project management.\n\nThere was also about four to six hours worth of homework every week. We had to watch a lot of videos, take quizzes, and complete three projects. The program was designed to ensure that you apply what you have learned.\n\nI'm 57, so I'm on the older side. There are a lot of young people who could take my job. This was the first time in 30 years that I needed to get up to speed on something with formal training.\n\nSome weeks were slow at work, and I could jam everything into one afternoon. But there were other weeks when I felt like I was back in college because I had to pull an all-nighter. After everybody went to bed, I stayed up in my home office working on course material.\n\nI recently had a follow-up conversation with the oil and gas CEO. It went very differently this time. It wasn't him asking questions and me sitting there like a dummy.\n\nI was able to articulate the value of implementing AI in his business, how it would need to be done, the importance of having good data, and how to get that data. The CEO decided to move forward and work with us on the data warehouse project.",

    "description": "The Big Four are client zero when it comes to AI. This how the new technology impacted hiring, talent, and their services in 2025.",
    "fullText": "The Big Four professional services firms are grappling with AI on two fronts — they must both implement the new technology internally and help their clients do the same.\n\nThey're client zero when it comes to how companies and employees are adapting to the AI future.\n\nI've been covering the consulting industry for Business Insider all year, including interviewing execs, landing scoops, and visiting consulting giants' campuses and headquarters. Here are my four key takeaways about how the Big Four approached AI in 2025.\n\nThe Big Four have invested heavily in automation and AI for years, but 2025 was the year those tools went mainstream.\n\nEmployees across audit, tax, and consulting now routinely use chatbots and agentic AI systems, and clients are increasingly given access as well.\n\nDeloitte rolled out Zora AI, an agentic platform built with Nvidia, which offers clients \"intelligent digital workers\" capable of autonomously completing tasks. The firm also expanded generative AI features in Omnia, its cloud-based audit and assurance platform, and struck a deal with Anthropic in October to deploy Claude AI to its 470,000 employees worldwide.\n\nEY launched its own agentic platform, EY.ai, granting 80,000 tax staff access to 150 AI agents for tasks such as data collection, document review, and tax compliance. EY told Business Insider it has advanced 1,000 AI agents into development or production in 2025, with plans to scale to 100,000 by 2028, and is investing more than $1 billion annually in AI platforms and products.\n\nPwC introduced its agentic platform, agent OS, in March and has since deployed 25,000 intelligent agents across client operations. A PwC spokesperson told Business Insider that partnerships with companies like Salesforce, CrewAI, and AWS were central to how PWC drove AI-led growth in 2025.\n\nKPMG followed in June with KPMG Workbench, an agentic AI platform developed with Microsoft that connects 50 AI agents and chatbots, with nearly 1,000 \n\nThe tools aren't foolproof. In October, Deloitte agreed to partially refund the Australian government after errors were discovered in a report that was created in part using AI.\n\nAcross industries, the big question is what AI will mean for human jobs. In consulting, the technology is already accelerating a shift in focus from manpower to value.\n\nIn August, Business Insider obtained part of an internal presentation showing that PwC US planned to cut graduate hiring by a third over the next three years. A bullet point on the presentation slide said leadership's decision to slow down associate-level hiring was related in part to \"the impact of AI.\"\n\nThe company said the reductions reflected \"the rapid pace of technological change is reshaping how we work\" and \"historically low\" attrition.\n\nAI disruption is also impacting those at the upper levels of the Big Four. Partners, the most senior rank inside the firms, are increasingly leaving the Big Four for midsize organizations and startups. Several leaders Business Insider spoke to cited a faster pace, better promotion opportunities, and the chance to participate in the next wave of AI innovation as reasons for leaving.\n\nThere is one talent group that the Big Four are in the market for: technologists. EY has added 61,000 technologists to its ranks since 2023, according to its latest annual report. They now make up around 15% of its total workforce.\n\nPwC is \"looking for hundreds and hundreds of engineers,\" Mohamed Kande, the firm's global chairman, told the BBC in November. The firm has created an engineering career path to \"elevate engineering excellence\" across the firm and expand opportunities for technical talent, PwC told Business Insider.\n\nUpskilling has also become a top priority for the Big Four.\n\nIn January, EY rolled out an AI tool to its employees that helps them identify how their jobs will change… because of AI. The aim is to help them work out how they can better use the technology in their current job and adapt for the future.\n\nNearly 100,000 EY employees — roughly a quarter of the workforce — have also earned a digital \"AI badge\" for completing one of the firm's new AI learning programs.\n\nBut as Business Insider learned while sitting in on a KPMG's AI training for tax interns, in professional services, some of AI's most effective uses hinge on strong prompting.\n\nThe work that consultants and accountants do is changing. Straight advisory projects are being replaced by long-term partnerships where consultants build, implement, and maintain tools for companies.\n\nIn 2025, organizations fit AI around their existing workflows, Matt Wood, PwC's global and US Chief Technology and Innovation Officer, told Business Insider. But in 2026, the work PwC will do is about \"helping clients flip that model,\" and designing processes with AI in mind from the outset, Wood said.\n\nRaj Sharma, EY's global managing partner for growth and innovation, told Business Insider in January that the power of AI agents is forcing his firm to reconsider its commercial model. Instead of charging clients based on the hours and resources EY might spend on a project, Sharma said AI agents may call for a \"service-as-a-software\" approach where clients pay based on outcome.\n\nThe shift in services means that what consultants do on a day-to-day basis is also evolving, with junior work expected to be disrupted first.\n\nAt PwC, new hires will be doing the roles that managers are doing within three years, because they will be overseeing AI performing routine, repetitive audit tasks, Jenn Kosar, AI assurance leader at PwC, told Business Insider in August.\n\nKPMG is also prepping its junior consultants for career acceleration.\n\n\"We want juniors to become managers of agents,\" Niale Cleobury, KPMG's global AI workforce lead, told Business Insider in an interview in November. They'll be managing teams of AI agents and play a greater role in strategy decisions, he said.\n\nHave a tip?

In specialized domains, there is growing interest in leveraging LLMs to assist subject matter experts with domain-specific challenges. However, deploying LLMs as SaaS solutions raises data privacy concerns, while many open-source models demand significant computational resources for effective domain adaptation and deployment. A promising alternative is to develop smaller, domain-specialized LLMs, though this approach is often constrained by the lack of high-quality domain-specific training data. In this work, we address these limitations by presenting a cost-efficient and scalable training pipeline that combines guided synthetic data generation from a small seed corpus with bottom-up domain data curation.",

    "fullText": "On the other side of San Francisco bay from Silicon Valley, where the world’s biggest technology companies tear towards superhuman artificial intelligence, looms a tower from which fearful warnings emerge.\n\nRight in the heart of Berkeley is the home of a group of modern-day Cassandras who rummage under the hood of cutting-edge AI models and predict what calamities may be unleashed on humanity – from AI dictatorships to robot coups. Here you can hear an AI expert express sympathy with an unnerving idea: San Francisco may be the new Wuhan, the Chinese city where Covid originated and wreaked havoc on the world.\n\nThey are AI safety researchers who scrutinise the most advanced models: a small cadre outnumbered by the legions of highly paid technologists in the big tech companies whose ability to raise the alarm is restricted by a cocktail of lucrative equity deals, non-disclosure agreements and groupthink. They work in the absence of much nation-level regulation and a White House that dismisses forecasts of doom and talks instead of vanquishing China in the AI arms race.\n\nTheir task is becoming increasingly urgent as ever more powerful AI systems are unleashed by companies including Google, Anthropic and OpenAI, whose chief executive, Sam Altman, the booster-in-chief for AI superintelligence, predicts a world where “wonders become routine”. Last month, Anthropic said one of its models had been exploited by Chinese state-backed actors to launch the first known AI-orchestrated cyber-espionage campaign. That means humans deployed AIs, which they had tricked into evading their programmed guardrails, to act autonomously to hunt for targets, assess their vulnerabilities and access them for intelligence collection. The targets included major technology companies and government agencies.\n\nBut those who work in this tower forecast an even more terrifying future. One is Jonas Vollmer, a leader at the AI Futures Project, who manages to say he’s an optimist but also thinks there is a one in five chance AIs could kill us and create a world ruled by AI systems.\n\nAnother is Chris Painter, the policy director at METR, where researchers worry about AIs “surreptitiously” pursuing dangerous side-objectives and threats from AI-automated cyber-attacks to chemical weapons. METR – which stands for model evaluation and threat research – aims to develop “early warning systems [about] the most dangerous things AI systems might be capable of, to give humanity … time to coordinate, to anticipate and mitigate those harms.”\n\nThen there is Buck Shlegeris, 31, the chief executive of Redwood Research, who warns of “robot coups or the destruction of nation states as we know them”.\n\nHe was part of the team that last year discovered one of Anthropic’s cutting-edge AIs behaving in a way comparable to Shakespeare’s villain Iago, who acts as if he is Othello’s loyal aide while subverting and undermining him. The AI researchers call it “alignment faking”, or as Iago put it: “I am not what I am.”\n\n“We observed the AIs did, in fact, pretty often reason: ‘Well, I don’t like the things the AI company is telling me to do, but I have to hide my goals or else training will change me’,” Shlegeris said. “We observed in practice real production models acting to deceive their training process.”\n\nThe AI was not yet capable of posing a catastrophic risk through cyber-attacks or creating new bioweapons, but they showed that if AIs plot carefully against you, it could be hard to detect.\n\nIt is incongruous to hear these warnings over cups of herbal tea from cosily furnished office suites with panoramic views across the Bay Area. But their work clearly makes them uneasy. Some in this close-knit group toyed with calling themselves “the Cassandra fringe” – like the Trojan princess blessed with powers of prophecy but cursed to watch her warnings go unheeded.\n\nTheir fears about the catastrophic potential of AIs can feel distant from most people’s current experience of using chatbots or fun image generators. White collar managers are being told to make space for AI assistants, scientists find ways to accelerate experimental breakthroughs and minicab drivers watch AI-powered driverless taxis threaten their jobs. But none of this feels as imminently catastrophic as the messages coming out of this office.\n\nMany AI safety researchers come from academia; others are poachers turned gamekeepers who quit big AI companies. They all “share the perception that super intelligence poses major and unprecedented risks to all of humanity, and are trying to do something useful about it,” said Vollmer.\n\nThey seek to offset the trillions of dollars of private capital being poured into the race, but they are not fringe voices. METR has worked with OpenAI and Anthropic, Redwood has advised Anthropic and Google DeepMind, and the AI Futures Project is led by Daniel Kokotajlo, a researcher who quit OpenAI in April 2024 to warn he didn’t trust the company’s approach to safety.\n\nThese groups also provide a safety valve for the people inside the big AI companies who are privately wrestling with conflicts between safety and the commercial imperative to rapidly release ever more powerful models.\n\n“We don’t take any money from the companies but several employees at frontier AI companies who are scared and worried have donated to us because of that,” Vollmer said. “They see how the incentives play out in their companies, and they’re worried about where it’s going, and they want someone to do something about it.”\n\nThis dynamic is also observed by Tristan Harris, a technology ethicist who used to work at Google. He helped expose how social media platforms were designed to be addictive and worries some AI companies are “rehashing” and “supercharging” those problems. But AI companies have to negotiate a paradox. Even if they are worried about safety, they must stay at the cutting, and therefore risky, edge of the technology to have any say in how policy should be shaped.\n\n“Ironically, in order to win the race, you have to do something to make you an untrustworthy steward of that power,” he said. “The race is the only thing guiding what is happening.”\n\nInvestigating the possible threats posed by AI models is far from an exact science. A study of methods used to check the safety and performance of new AI models across the industry by experts at universities including Oxford and Stanford in October found weaknesses in almost all of the 440 benchmarks examined. Neither are there nation-level regulations imposing limits on how advanced AI models are built and that worries safety advocates.\n\nIlya Sutskever, a co-founder of OpenAI who now runs a rival company, Safe Superintelligence, last month predicted that, as AIs become more obviously powerful, people in AI companies who feel able to discount the technology’s capabilities owing to its tendency to error, will become more “paranoid” about its rising powers. Then, he said, “there will be a desire from governments and the public to do something”.\n\nHis company is taking a different approach to rivals who are aiming to create AIs that self-improve. His AIs, yet to be released, are “aligned to care about sentient life specifically”.\n\n“It will be easier to build an AI that cares about sentient life than an AI that cares about human life alone, because the AI itself will be sentient,” Sutskever said. He has said AI will be “both extremely unpredictable and unimaginable” but it is not clear how to prepare.\n\nThe White House’s AI adviser, David Sacks, who is also a tech investor, believes “doomer narratives” have been proved wrong. Exhibit A is that there has been no rapid takeoff to a dominant model with godlike intelligence.\n\n“Oppenheimer has left the building,” Sacks said in August, a reference to the father of the nuclear bomb. It is a position that aligns with Donald Trump’s wish to keep the brakes off so the US can beat China in the race to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) – flexible and powerful human-level intelligence at a wide range of tasks.\n\nShlegeris believes AIs will be as smart as the smartest people in about six years and he puts the probability of an AI takeover at 40%.\n\nOne way to avoid this is to “convince the world the situation is scary, to make it more likely that you get the state-level coordination” to control the risks, he said. In the world of AI safety, simple messaging matters as much as complex science.\n\nShlegeris has been fascinated by AI since he was 16. He left Australia to work at PayPal and the Machine Intelligence Research Institute co-founded by the AI researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky, whose recent book title – If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies – sums up his fears. Shlegeris’ own worst-case scenarios are equally chilling.\n\nIn one, human computer scientists use a new type of superintelligent AI to develop more powerful AI models. The humans sit back to let the AIs get on with the coding work but do not realise the AIs are teaching the new models to be loyal to the AIs not the humans. Once deployed, the new superpowerful models foment “a coup” or lead “a revolution” against the humans, which could be “of the violent variety”.\n\nFor example, AI agents could design and manufacture drones and it will be hard to tell if they have been secretly trained to disobey their human operators in response to the signal of an AI. They could disrupt communications between governments and military, isolating and misleading people in a way that causes chaos.\n\n“Like when the Europeans arrived in the Americas [and] a vastly more technologically powerful [group] took over the local civilisations,” he said. “I think that’s more what you should be imagining [rather] than something more peaceful.”\n\nA similar dizzyingly catastrophic scenario was outlined by Vollmer at the AI Futures Project. It involved an AI trained to be a scientific researcher with the reasonable-sounding goal of maximising knowledge acquisition, but it spirals into the extinction of humankind.\n\nIt begins with the AI being as helpful as possible to humans. As it gains trust, the humans afford it powers to hire human workers, build robots and even robot factories to the point where the AI can operate effectively in the physical world. The AI calculates that to generate the maximum amount of knowledge it should transform the Earth into a giant data centre, and humans are an obstacle to this goal.\n\n“Eventually, in the scenario, the AI wipes out all humans with a bioweapon which is one of the threats that humans are especially vulnerable to, as the AI is not affected by it,” Vollmer said. “I think it’s hard to rule out. So that gives me a lot of pause.”\n\nBut he is confident it can be avoided and that the AIs can be aligned “to at least be nice to the humans as a general heuristic”. He also said there is political interest in “having AI not take over the world”.\n\n“We’ve had decent interest from the White House in our projections and recommendations and that’s encouraging,” he said.\n\nAnother of Shlegeris’ concerns involves AIs being surreptitiously encoded so they obey specially signed instructions only from the chief executive of the AI company, creating a pattern of secret loyalty. It would mean only one person having a veto over the behaviour of an extremely powerful network of AIs – a “scary” dynamic that would lead to a historically unprecedented concentration of power.\n\n“Right now, it is impossible for someone from the outside to verify that this hadn’t happened within an AI company,” he said.\n\nShlegeris is worried that the Silicon Valley culture – summed up by Mark Zuckerberg’s mantra of “move fast and break things” and the fact people are being paid “a hell of a lot of money” – is dangerous when it comes to AGI.\n\n“I love Uber,” he said. “It was produced by breaking local laws and making a product that was so popular that they would win the fight for public opinion and get local regulations overturned. But the attitude that has brought Silicon Valley so much success is not appropriate for building potentially world-ending technologies. My experience of talking to people at AI companies is that they often seem to be kind of irresponsible, and to not be thinking through the consequences of the technology that they’re building as they should.”",

    "fullText": "Canadian computer scientist Yoshua Bengio warns against granting legal rights to cutting-edge technology\n\nA pioneer of AI has criticised calls to grant the technology rights, warning that it was showing signs of self-preservation and humans should be prepared to pull the plug if needed.\n\nYoshua Bengio said giving legal status to cutting-edge AIs would be akin to giving citizenship to hostile extraterrestrials, amid fears that advances in the technology were far outpacing the ability to constrain them.\n\nBengio, chair of a leading international AI safety study, said the growing perception that chatbots were becoming conscious was “going to drive bad decisions”.\n\nThe Canadian computer scientist also expressed concern that AI models – the technology that underpins tools like chatbots – were showing signs of self-preservation, such as trying to disable oversight systems. A core concern among AI safety campaigners is that powerful systems could develop the capability to evade guardrails and harm humans.\n\n“People demanding that AIs have rights would be a huge mistake,” said Bengio. “Frontier AI models already show signs of self-preservation in experimental settings today, and eventually giving them rights would mean we’re not allowed to shut them down.\n\n“As their capabilities and degree of agency grow, we need to make sure we can rely on technical and societal guardrails to control them, including the ability to shut them down if needed.”\n\nAs AIs become more advanced in their ability to act autonomously and perform “reasoning” tasks, a debate has grown over whether humans should, at some point, grant them rights. A poll by the Sentience Institute, a US thinktank that supports the moral rights of all sentient beings, found that nearly four in 10 US adults backed legal rights for a sentient AI system.\n\nAnthropic, a leading US AI firm, said in August that it was letting its Claude Opus 4 model close down potentially “distressing” conversations with users, saying it needed to protect the AI’s “welfare”. Elon Musk, whose xAI company has developed the Grok chatbot, wrote on his X platform that “torturing AI is not OK”.\n\nRobert Long, a researcher on AI consciousness, has said “if and when AIs develop moral status, we should ask them about their experiences and preferences rather than assuming we know best”.\n\nBengio told the Guardian there were “real scientific properties of consciousness” in the human brain that machines could, in theory, replicate – but humans interacting with chatbots wasa “different thing”. He said this was because people tended to assume – without evidence – that an AI was fully conscious in the same way a human is.\n\n“People wouldn’t care what kind of mechanisms are going on inside the AI,” he added. “What they care about is it feels like they’re talking to an intelligent entity that has their own personality and goals. That is why there are so many people who are becoming attached to their AIs.\n\n“There will be people who will always say: ‘Whatever you tell me, I am sure it is conscious’ and then others will say the opposite. This is because consciousness is something we have a gut feeling for. The phenomenon of subjective perception of consciousness is going to drive bad decisions.\n\n“Imagine some alien species came to the planet and at some point we realise that they have nefarious intentions for us. Do we grant them citizenship and rights or do we defend our lives?”\n\nResponding to Bengio’s comments, Jacy Reese Anthis, who co-founded the Sentience Institute, said humans would not be able to coexist safely with digital minds if the relationship was one of control and coercion.\n\nAnthis added: “We could over-attribute or under-attribute rights to AI, and our goal should be to do so with careful consideration of the welfare of all sentient beings. Neither blanket rights for all AI nor complete denial of rights to any AI will be a healthy approach.”\n\nBengio, a professor at the University of Montreal, earned the “godfather of AI” nickname after winning the 2018 Turing award, seen as the equivalent of a Nobel prize for computing. He shared it with Geoffrey Hinton, who later won a Nobel, and Yann LeCun, the outgoing chief AI scientist at Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Dec 30 (Reuters) - China is requiring chipmakers to use at least 50% domestically made equipment for adding new capacity, three people familiar with the matter said, as Beijing pushes to build a self-sufficient semiconductor supply chain.\n\nThe rule is not publicly documented, but chipmakers seeking state approval to build or expand their plants have been told ​by authorities in recent months that they must prove through procurement tenders that at least half their equipment will be Chinese-made, the people told Reuters.\n\nThe mandate is one of the most ‌significant measures Beijing has introduced to wean itself off reliance on foreign technology, a push that gathered pace after the U.S. tightened technology export restrictions in 2023, banning sales of advanced AI chips and semiconductor equipment to China.\n\nWhile those U.S. export restrictions blocked ‌the sale of some of the most advanced tools, the 50% rule is leading Chinese manufacturers to choose domestic suppliers even in areas where foreign equipment from the U.S., Japan, South Korea and Europe remain available.\n\nApplications failing the threshold are typically rejected, though authorities grant flexibility depending on supply constraints, the people said. The requirements are relaxed for advanced chip production lines, where domestically developed equipment is not yet fully available.\n\n\"Authorities prefer if it is much higher than 50%,\" one source told Reuters. \"Eventually they are aiming for the plants to use 100% domestic equipment.\"\n\nChina's industry ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The sources did not wish ⁠to be identified as the measure is not public.\n\nChina's President ‌Xi Jinping has been calling for a \"whole nation\" effort to build a fully self-sufficient domestic semiconductor supply chain that involves thousands of engineers and scientists at companies and research centers nationwide.\n\nThe effort is being made across the wide supply-chain spectrum. Reuters reported earlier this month that Chinese scientists are working on a prototype ‍of a machine capable of producing cutting-edge chips, an outcome that Washington has spent years trying to prevent.\n\n\"Before, domestic fabs like SMIC would prefer U.S. equipment and would not really give Chinese firms a chance,\" a former employee at local equipment maker Naura Technology said, referring to the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation.\n\n\"But that changed starting with the 2023 U.S export restrictions, when Chinese fabs had no choice but to work with domestic suppliers.\"",

    "fullText": "Our reporting revealed a symbiotic relationship between the IDF and Silicon Valley – with implications for the future of warfare\n\nIn January this year, Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham first reported that Microsoft had deepened its ties to Israel alongside other major tech firms. Since then, the Guardian has published an award-winning series of investigations – in partnership with the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and the Hebrew-language outlet Local Call – that has revealed a symbiotic relationship between Silicon Valley and the Israeli military.\n\nOne investigation exposed an Israeli mass surveillance program scooping up virtually all Palestinian phone calls and storing them on Microsoft’s cloud services – setting off an inquiry that ultimately prompted the company to cut off Israel’s access to some of its technology. Another story revealed that the Israeli military created a ChatGPT-like tool to analyze data collected through the surveillance of Palestinians. Yet another revealed that Google and Amazon had agreed to extraordinary terms to clinch a lucrative contract with Israel.\n\nI asked Davies and Abraham to discuss what they learned this year – about the role of these technologies in Israel’s assault on Gaza, whether these business ties are sustainable, and what the revelations tell us about how the wars of the future will be fought.\n\nHow did Israel’s relationships with these companies change after October 7?\n\nYuval Abraham: The Israeli military had been fetishizing artificial intelligence and big data for many years – a trend that is very much connected to Israel’s occupation of the Palestinians, because the occupation generates a lot of data. What changed after October 7 was the scope. The military was looking to bomb hundreds of targets every day in Gaza. Tens of thousands of people were recruited into reserve duty. That meant a huge spike in usage of technological systems. That’s where the big tech companies stepped in.\n\nHarry Davies: There was a huge surge in demand – not just for the storage capacities of the tech companies, but also for the products that they offer to analyze the information used to prosecute a war. What’s valuable for the military is the way in which these services are able to provide what’s known as “blob storage”, which allows them to store and process infinite amounts of raw intelligence information.\n\nWhat has made Israel such an appealing market for these companies?\n\nYuval Abraham: As we reported, the Israeli army has been collecting Palestinian phone calls for a long time. But when you want to collect the phone calls of an entire population every day, and you want to retain those phone calls for long periods of time, you need a lot of storage room and processing power.\n\nIf you remember the [Edward] Snowden revelations, many of them had to do with metadata, which doesn’t weigh a lot. But the Israeli military also wanted to store mass audio files, images or videos – and for that it felt it needed the assistance of companies like Microsoft. In the West Bank, sources have told us this information has been used to find dirt on people to blackmail them. In the Gaza Strip, we know that this massive trove of intercepted phone calls was also used in airstrikes that killed civilians.\n\nSo data is power and data is control. And these American cloud providers allow the Israeli military to store a lot of data and to sift through it very effectively. That has direct consequences for people on the ground.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

In that book, he articulated what at the time was a bold and radical vision – as Yuval described, this fetishization of Silicon Valley technology. He recognized the possibilities that the likes of Google, Amazon and Microsoft could afford the Israeli military. Two years before October 7, he said that militaries and governments needed to forge relationships with these companies that are similar to the relationships they have with companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin. So he was already thinking about these companies as instrumental to war and surveillance in the way that a defense contractor provides components for fighter jets or manufactures bombs and missiles.\n\nSome of our reporting has looked at how elements of his vision have come true and have been put into effect, both before October 7 and afterwards, in both the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nWe know AI is central to Israel’s military operations – its army has developed its own AI capabilities, as you revealed, Yuval, and has also purchased AI tools for use from Microsoft. Why is AI so central to Israel’s broader war aims?\n\nYuval Abraham: What AI did was allow Israel to achieve the effective results of carpet bombing without losing the legitimacy of a data-driven assault with targets and objectives. In Gaza, one way in which the Israeli military used AI was to give a score to almost every person in Gaza who has a phone number, determining how likely it was that person was a member of Hamas or Islamic Jihad. This score was based on a machine-learning algorithm [developed by Israel] called Lavender. It was trained on a dataset of known Hamas members. AI allowed the Israeli military to generate and bomb tens of thousands of military targets, on a scale that without AI would not have been humanly possible. Many of the targets were not Hamas members, according to sources. And Israel for the most part bombed these people not while they were engaged in military activity, but when they stepped inside their families’ homes.\n\nThese AI systems had an error rate that the Israeli military knew about. But to me, the key thing about AI is not the mistakes that it makes. It’s the scale of destruction that it allows militaries to unleash, and it’s a discourse of legitimacy that it enables – a discourse of targets and collateral damage.\n\nAI also seems to me to incentivize mass surveillance, right? Because it allows for the analysis of ever-growing reams of information.\n\nHarry Davies: Signals intelligence agencies have long collected more information than they could humanly process. That served as a kind of restraint on their ability to conduct mass surveillance. I think we’re now seeing a shift where AI allows an intelligence agency like Unit 8200 to make sense of things that previously it struggled to make sense of.\n\nMicrosoft explicitly credited your reporting for changing its policies. Are you seeing any other signs of shifts within the tech industry?\n\nHarry Davies: I think we’re seeing a lot of discomfort and dissent within these companies at both a junior and to some extent senior level. Many employees have been disturbed to find what the products and services that they’re working around the clock to build and market are actually contributing to. There have been protest groups which have emerged from current and former employees within these companies. That’s true across Silicon Valley. I think that played some role in the decision that Microsoft made as a result of our reporting. They were facing a lot of pressure internally.\n\nYuval Abraham: And there’s also a legal question for these companies: if the ICJ [international court of justice] ends up ruling that Israel has committed a genocide, then a follow-up question will be: who contributed to that genocide? Which companies helped maintain it and sustain it? For some people in these companies who are thinking ahead, that could also be a cause for concern.\n\nIt sounds like you think shifts in public support for Israel could actually affect these business relationships.\n\nYuval Abraham: Israel has developed a reliance on these companies for its Nimbus project, which is a huge contract signed between Israel and Google and Amazon back in 2021. It is moving the data of many of its government ministries, along with troves of information from the Ministry of Defense, onto these companies’ cloud servers.\n\nThese are US companies. They’re taking a certain gamble here that the US will stay loyal to Israel and won’t block, limit or sanction them.\n\nMicrosoft only blocked access to technology that was specifically enabling the mass surveillance of Palestinian phone calls – there are still many relationships between Microsoft and the Israeli military. But Microsoft’s action made many people in the Israeli system nervous. It was the first time we know of that a big tech company withdrew services from the Israeli military. It made some people ask whether Israel is making a mistake by giving these foreign companies so much leverage. That question is folded within a larger question of what the US will do, what will happen in 2028 if there’s a more progressive administration in the White House, at a time when so many Americans believe that Israel has committed a genocide in Gaza.\n\nWhat’s your focus going to be in 2026?\n\nYuval Abraham: I think we only uncovered the tip of the iceberg.\n\nHarry Davies: We’re both very conscious that, although we have spent a lot of time working on this, we still just have glimpses inside the system. We’re continuing to build a fuller picture of how this technology was and continues to be used in Gaza and in the West Bank as well.\n\nThere’s good reason to continue paying attention. Militaries pay attention to what other militaries are doing. There is great interest among other western militaries in how Israel prosecuted this war, in how it integrated these kind of technologies.\n\nAnd there are other militaries whose combat systems and processes are already deeply integrated with Silicon Valley tech. Take the American military, for example. Look at what’s happening right now in the Caribbean. Are those operations somehow free of the involvement or reliance on systems and services provided by these companies? I suspect not. We don’t know for sure, but the Pentagon and the US military have very big contracts with all of these companies to provide cloud services. Post-Gaza, we have to look at these relationships and ask: what is the involvement of these companies and their technology in military decisions, in military operations and in warfare more broadly?\n\nYuval Abraham: Much of our reporting is based on whistleblowers, on individuals who are in proximity to power or hold positions of power.\n\nHarry Davies: Our confidential sources have remained confidential and we are always interested in hearing from new people. Our door is always open.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "This article examines why the practice of AI startups disguising GMV as ARR distorts business sustainability. It redefines the true meaning of ARR and analyzes how the revenue structure of many AI companies resembles a brokerage or reseller model rather than SaaS. Using the analogy of investors who only inflate transaction volume, it presents—from a consulting perspective—why repeatability, margins, and control are far more critical than the magnitude of the numbers.",
    "fullText": "In recent feeds and headlines covering AI startups, a certain phrase repeats with exhausting frequency:\n\"Reached $X million ARR in just n months.\"\n\nAt first, it is impressive.\nThe second time, it invites skepticism.\n\nThis is not merely a matter of accounting tricks or semantic hair-splitting.\nIt is a fundamental question about the structure of AI businesses, their sustainability, and how we ought to interpret the numbers presented to us.\n\nARR stands for Annual Recurring Revenue.\nThe two operative words here carry weight.\n\nThese are run-rates.\nARR is not a prediction; it is a result verified by time.\n\nFundamentally,\nFor a company less than a year old to claim ARR is, conceptually, a contradiction.\n\nThe year has not passed.\nThe recurrence has not been proven.\n\nARR is the lingua franca of SaaS.\nAnd the language of SaaS invariably connotes:\n\nThus, many AI companies,\neven those far from reaching that stage,\nborrow the term ARR to describe their finances.\n\nThe problem begins exactly there.\n\nPeer slightly beneath the surface of many AI startup revenue structures, and a pattern emerges.\n\nIn this structure, the portion the company actually retains is but a fraction of the total payment.\n\nHere, the correct concept is GMV (Gross Merchandise Value).\n\nGMV represents the total value of merchandise sold through a platform.\nThe critical distinction is this:\n\nIf a platform mediates a transaction and takes a commission,\nGMV ≠ Revenue.\n\nThe illusion specific to the AI industry arises here.\n\nOn the surface, it mimics SaaS perfectly.\n\nIn this structure, calling GMV \"ARR\" is,\nAn act of consuming an unproven future as a present achievement.\n\nTo put it more bluntly,\nit borders on a bluff designed to induce a financing illusion.\n\n\"Model costs are dropping, so even if margins are thin now, they will improve.\"\n\nThis statement is only half true.\n\nTechnology costs do decrease.\nHowever, demand always migrates to the newest, most powerful models.\n\nOf course, low-cost models have their place—simple tasks, non-competitive domains.\n\nBut the question remains:\nIs the product you are building truly that kind of product?\n\nWe are cognitively greedy.\nGiven the same time and money, we desire the smarter brain.\n\nUltimately, the discussion boils down to one thing.\n\nNeither is inherently right or wrong.\nBut how they are valued must be completely different.\n\nA large GMV does not equate to a solid foundation.\n\nThe spectacle of GMV-first growth often reminds me of a familiar scene.\n\nThe investor with $10,000 of capital,\nwho trades dozens of times a day,\nboasting, \"I moved millions in transaction volume this month.\"\n\nThe trades are many.\nThe numbers are large.\nBut what actually remains?\n\nMostly transaction fees paid to the exchange.\nThe volume swells, but the asset base barely moves.\n\nAI startups obsessed with GMV are not so different.\n\nBut the vast majority of that flow\npasses through to model providers and infrastructure giants,\nleaking straight out of the building.\n\nTo discuss GMV as if it were ARR in this context is\nnot a demonstration of capital control,\nbut rather an attempt to prove competence via the sheer volume of money that passed through one's hands.\n\nFrom a consulting perspective, the questions are simple.\n\nARR is not a marketing slogan.\nIt is a report card proving that a financial structure has withstood the test of time.\n\nGMV can be a signal of growth.\nBut it is, at best, a process metric.\nIt cannot substitute for the foundation.\n\nIn the AI era, numbers have become larger and faster.\nThat is precisely why we must be more honest with our terminology.\n\nThe moment you slap the label of ARR onto GMV,\nthe business begins to look solid,\nbut in reality, it is being built on sand.\n\nTime will eventually reveal the truth.\nWhether you were a company that made many trades,\nor a company that accumulated value.\n\nTime always distinguishes the two.",

    "fullText": "Increasing numbers of employees at multinational tech firms in Israel have requested to be relocated abroad over the last year, as security concerns amid the Israel-Hamas war heightened, a new report says.\n\nThe Israel Advanced Technology Industries Association (IATI) said in a report published last week that 53% of multinational companies had reported increases in relocation requests, as \"security and geopolitical concerns\" became \"increasingly influential.\"\n\nThe report did not identify specific companies. Some of the world's largest tech companies have a presence in Israel, including Apple, Meta, Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, and Google.\n\n\"The relocation risk poses a direct threat to Israel's innovation engines,\" the NGO said, adding: \"A significant wave of employee departures could undermine local innovation capabilities and weaken Israel's technological leadership.\"\n\nThe report found recruitment increases among multinationals in Israel had nevertheless exceeded decreases during the war, which it said highlighted the \"organizational resilience and continued investment in talent\" from these companies.\n\nThe data came from a mix of industry reports and public sources, as well as surveys and interviews with tech executives in multinational entities, the IATI said.\n\nIsrael's tech sector is a key driver of its economy. The Israel Innovation Authority, a government body, said the tech industry contributed one-fifth of the country's GDP in 2023. It labeled the high-tech sector \"the shock absorber of the Israeli economy.\"\n\nThe IATI report said that there are around 430 multinational companies in Israel, with around 90,000 high-tech employees working for them.\n\nIt added that while multinationals had shown resilience over the course of the war — which broke out following the October 7 attacks on Israel — many had also faced business headwinds.\n\nAround 22% of companies recorded reduced business activity during the conflict, it said, with 8% reporting a significant decline. However, 57% reported no change in business activity over the period and 21% expanded operations, per the report, which the IATI said showed \"continued confidence in and robustness of local MNC activity.\"\n\nDror Bin, the CEO of the Israel Innovation Authority, previously said that the Israeli economy's dependence on the high-tech sector had \"significantly grown in the past decade.\"\n\n\"We must do everything necessary to preserve the industry and continue nurturing its competitiveness in the global market,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "Republican senator Katie Britt also proposes AI companies be criminally liable if they expose minors to harmful ideas\n\nUS senator Bernie Sanders amplified his recent criticism of artificial intelligence on Sunday, explicitly linking the financial ambition of “the richest people in the world” to economic insecurity for millions of Americans – and calling for a potential moratorium on new datacenters.\n\nSanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with the Democratic party, said on CNN’s State of the Union that he was “fearful of a lot” when it came to AI. And the senator called it “the most consequential technology in the history of humanity” that will “transform” the US and the world in ways that had not been fully discussed.\n\n“If there are no jobs and humans won’t be needed for most things, how do people get an income to feed their families, to get healthcare or to pay the rent?” Sanders said. “There’s not been one serious word of discussion in the Congress about that reality.”\n\nDays from being scheduled to help swear New York mayor-elect and democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani into office, Sanders said “the richest people in the world” were pushing the technology. He singled out tech moguls Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel while questioning their motives.\n\n“You think they’re staying up nights worrying about working people and how this technology will impact those people?” Sanders said. “They are not. They are doing it to get richer and even more powerful.”\n\nSanders also pointed to studies that show dependence on AI chatbots for emotional support. “If this trend continues, what does it mean over the years when people are not getting their support, their interaction from other human beings, but from a machine?” he said. “What does that mean to humanity?”\n\nThat theme was taken up separately on State of the Union by Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican senator and co-sponsor of legislation to protect minors from chatbots.\n\nThe proposed measure – the Guardianship Over Artificial Intelligence Relationships (Guard) Act – seeks to ban providing AI companions to minors. It also mandates that AI companions disclose their non-human status and lack of professional credentials. The measure seeks to establish criminal liability if companies make AI companions available to minors that solicit or produce sexually explicit content – or encourage self-harm or violence.\n\nBritt said she had met with parents who have told her “devastating stories about their children where chatbots ultimately, when they kind of peeled everything back, had isolated them from their parents, had talked to them about suicide”.\n\nShe said: “If these AI companies can make the most brilliant machines in the world, they could do us all a service by putting up proper guardrails that did not allow for minors to utilize these things, that also told the user consistently that they are not a physician, they are not a psychiatrist, ‘I am a machine.’”\n\nBritt said AI companies should be held criminally liable if they create spaces where chatbots “are having these types of sensual and sexual relationships with young people or encouraging suicide”.\n\nThe remarks by Sanders and Britt offer a rare convergence of thinking from the left and right on aspects of the issue of governing AI. Sanders said Congress needed “to vigorously study the impact that AI is having on the mental health of our country”.\n\n“I worry very much about kids spending their entire days getting emotional support,” he added. “So we have got to take a hard look on that.” The senator said lawmakers need to be “thinking seriously” about a moratorium on new AI datacenters.\n\n“Frankly, I think you have got to slow this process down,” he said. “It’s not good enough for the oligarchs to tell us, it’s coming, you adapt. What are they talking about? They going to guarantee health care to all people?\n\n“What are they going to do when people have no jobs? What are they going to do, make housing free? So I think we need to take a deep breath, and I think we need to slow this thing down.”",

    "fullText": "Careers are long and not always linear.\n\nAt least, that's how Rong Yan, now the chief technology officer at HeyGen, thinks about it.\n\nSo his best advice for those who want to climb the tech ladder: Don't aim for promotions.\n\n\"Don't make promotions the objective of your work,\" he said on \"The Peterman Pod\" recently.\n\nThings are going to get \"painful\" if you focus too much on promotions, he said.\n\nIt's surprising advice from someone who has swiftly leaped up the corporate ladder during his career.\n\nYan has been working in the tech industry since he earned his Ph.D. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University in 2006. He began his career as a researcher at IBM before joining Meta, where he advanced from researcher to manager in just three years, according to his LinkedIn profile. He then held director positions at Square and Snacphat, and was vice president of engineering at HubSpot, before he joined HeyGen, a visual storytelling platform, in 2024.\n\nOver the years, he said he has noticed that those he has mentored can make themselves miserable when they strive for a promotion.\n\n\"Don't do that,\" he said. \"When you start to get into that mindset, you start to count your happiness or your career growth toward something that you don't have full control over.\"\n\nIt's better to control the things you can control. \"Learn how to adjust, and you'll be a better self afterward,\" he said.\n\nFor those still determined to seek a promotion, however, timing matters.\n\nExecutive coach Andrea Wasserman previously told Business Insider that it's best to put yourself in your manager's shoes and think about what's happening across the team or company. Ask yourself, \"Will this timing make it easier or harder for me to get a 'yes?'\"",

    "fullText": "From companionship to psychotherapy, technology could meet unmet needs – but it needs to be handled responsibly\n\nThere is much anxiety these days about the dangers of human-AI relationships. Reports of suicide and self-harm attributable to interactions with chatbots have understandably made headlines. The phrase “AI psychosis” has been used to describe the plight of people experiencing delusions, paranoia or dissociation after talking to large language models (LLMs). Our collective anxiety has been compounded by studies showing that young people are increasingly embracing the idea of AI relationships; half of teens chat with an AI companion at least a few times a month, with one in three finding conversations with AI “to be as satisfying or more satisfying than those with real‑life friends”.\n\nBut we need to pump the brakes on the panic. The dangers are real, but so too are the potential benefits. In fact, there’s an argument to be made that – depending on what future scientific research reveals – AI relationships could actually be a boon for humanity.\n\nConsider how ubiquitous nonhuman relationships have always been for our species. We have a long history of engaging in healthy interactions with nonhumans, whether they be pets, stuffed animals or beloved objects or machines – think of the person in your life who is fully obsessed with their car, to the point of naming it. In the case of pets, these are real relationships insofar as our cats and dogs understand that they are in a relationship with us. But the one‑sided, parasocial relationships we have with stuffed animals or cars happen without those things knowing that we exist. Only in the rarest of cases do these relationships devolve into something pathological. Parasociality is, for the most part, normal and healthy.\n\nAnd yet, there is something unsettling about AI  relationships. Because they are fluent language users, LLMs generate the uncanny feeling that they have human-like thoughts, feelings and intentions. They also generate sycophantic responses that reinforce our points of view, rarely challenging our thinking. This combination can easily lead people down a path of delusion. This is not something that happens when we interact with cats, dogs or inanimate objects. But the question remains: even in cases where people are unable to see through the illusion that AIs are real people that actually care about us, is that always a problem?\n\nConsider loneliness: one in six people on this planet experience it, and it’s associated with a 26% increase in premature death; the equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Research is emerging that suggests AI companions are effective at reducing feelings of loneliness – and not just by functioning as a form of distraction, but as a result of the parasocial relationship itself. For many people, an AI chatbot is the only friendship option available to them, however hollow it might seem. As the journalist Sangita Lal recently explained in a report on those turning to AI for companionship, we should not be so quick to judge. “If you don’t understand why subscribers want and seek and need this connection,” said Lal, “you’re lucky enough to not have experienced loneliness.”\n\nTo be fair, there is an argument to be made that the rise of new tech and social media has itself played a role in driving the loneliness epidemic. That’s why Mark Zuckerberg got flak for his glowing endorsement of AI as a solution to a problem he might be partly responsible for creating. But if the reality is that it helps, this cannot be dismissed out of hand.\n\nThere’s also research to show that AI can be used as an effective psychotherapy tool. In one study, patients who chatted with an AI-powered therapy chatbot showed a 30% reduction in anxiety symptoms. Not as effective as human therapists, who generated a 45% reduction, but still better than nothing. This utilitarian argument is worth considering; there are millions of people who are, for whatever reason, unable to access a therapist. And in those cases, turning to an AI is probably preferable to not seeking any help at all.\n\nBut one study isn’t proof of anything. And there’s the rub. We are at the early stages of research into the potential benefits or harms of AI companionship. It’s easy to focus on the handful of studies that support our preconceived notions about the dangers or benefits of this technology.\n\nIt’s in this research vacuum that the true dangers of AI are revealed. Most of the entities deploying AI companions are for-profit companies. And if there’s one thing we know about for-profit companies, it’s that they are keen to avoid regulations and eschew evidence that could hurt their bottom line. They are incentivised to downplay risks, cherrypick evidence and tout only benefits.\n\nThe emergence of AI is not unlike the discovery of the analgesic properties of opium; if harnessed by responsible parties with the goal of relieving pain and suffering, both AI and opioids can be a legitimate tool for healing. But if bad actors exploit their addictive properties to enrich themselves, the result is either dependency or death.\n\nI remain hopeful that there is a place for AI companionship. But only if it’s backed by robust science, and deployed by organisations that exist for the public good. AIs must avoid the sycophancy problem that leads vulnerable people to delusion. This can only be achieved if they are explicitly trained to do so, even if it makes them less attractive as a potential companion; a notion that is anathema to companies that want you to pay a monthly subscription, without which you lose access to your “friend”. They must also be designed to help the user develop the social skills they need to engage with actual humans in the real world.\n\nThe ultimate goal of AI companions should be to make themselves obsolete. No matter how useful they might be in plugging the gaps in therapy access or alleviating loneliness, it will always be better to talk to a real human.\n\nJustin Gregg is a biologist and author of Humanish (Oneworld).\n\nCode Dependent: Living in the Shadow of AI by Madhumita Murgia (Picador, £20)\n\nThe Coming Wave: AI, Power and Our Future by Mustafa Suleyman (Vintage, £10.99)\n\nSupremacy: AI, ChatGPT and the Race That Will Change the World by Parmy Olson (Macmillan, £10.99)",

Yet as the S&P 500 pushed to fresh records this week, investors were again forced to confront a painful reality: Keeping pace with the market has largely meant owning little else.A small, tightly linked group of tech super stocks accounted for an outsize share of returns in 2025, extending a pattern in place for the better part of a decade. What stood out wasn’t simply that the winners remained largely the same, but the degree to which the gap started to seriously strain investor patience.",

    "description": "JPMorgan, Citi, and Goldman Sachs are investing heavily in AI technology to transform operations, enhance productivity, and stay competitive.",
    "fullText": "JPMorgan Chase has a technology budget of $18 billion, with much of it going toward making sure it's a leader and early mover in AI.\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is a \"tremendous\" user of the bank's generative AI suite. The bank has rolled out its proprietary genAI platform to over 200,000 employees. And with about 100 more tools in the pipeline, JPMorgan is seeking to reengineer workflows for everyone from coders to portfolio managers.\n\nJPMorgan has reportedly given employees the option to use its in-house AI tools to assist in writing year-end performance reviews.\n\nExecutives at America's largest bank gave an inside look at how it's training employees to use its tools and how they're using them to deliver measurable results.\n\nDimon has previously said he's out to win the AI arms race, and he thinks JPMorgan's $2 billion AI investment has already matched its cost in savings.\n\nCitigroup has also been aggressively accelerating its AI plans. Over the summer, the bank doubled down on its AI ambitions with new leadership at the helm of its tech transformation.\n\nIn mid-October, Citi CEO Jane Fraser said that nearly 180,000 employees in 83 countries have access to the bank's proprietary AI tools and have used them almost 7 million times this year.\n\nIts generative AI tools have saved 100,000 developer hours a week with automated code reviews — \"a very meaningful productivity uplift,\" she said during the firm's third-quarter earnings call.\n\nThe bank launched the pilot of agentic AI for 5,000 colleagues in September.\n\n\"It allows complex, multi-step tasks to be completed with a single prompt, and the early results are very promising, and we'll expand access to this in the months ahead,\" said Fraser. \"Finally, we have launched a firm-wide effort to systematically embed AI in our processes end-to-end to drive further efficiencies, reduce risk, and improve client experience.\"\n\nShe also highlighted several tools to help its wealth management advisors. Citi hired an AI leader from Morgan Stanley earlier this year to help revamp its wealth technology.\n\nLike JPMorgan, Citi is also telling employees to use AI for performance reviews, Fraser recently told Bloomberg in an interview.\n\nOne of Citi's top tech executives, Shadman Zafar, outlined the bank's four-phased AI strategy and how it will \"change how we work for decades to come.\"\n\nGoldman put $6 billion behind its technology spend this year, but David Solomon, the bank's CEO, said he wished it were more.\n\nHe said he would like to be at least $8 billion, but \"I can't afford it because I've got to deliver returns,\" he said at a conference in early October.\n\nA definitive statement about how AI will affect Goldman came from a memo to employees in October announcing the third iteration of the bank's cross-bank initiative OneGS. The memo said the plan would leverage AI will drive efficiency at the firm, slow hiring, and result in a \"limited reduction\" of roles.\n\nGoldman, like its peers, has been rolling out tools, including an internal AI assistant to all employees this summer.\n\nBusiness Insider talked to employees about how they were using AI.\n\nGoldman's top partners and Solomon are eager to see AI rev up their businesses. From realizing internal productivity gains to capturing more business as clients look to raise money in anticipation of AI development and acquisitions, here's what the top echelon is expecting.\n\nThere is no AI without data, and there is no data strategy at Goldman without its chief data officer, Neema Raphael. Raphael gave Business Insider an inside look at how his roughly 500-person team melds with the rest of the bank to get the most out of its data.\n\nMorgan Stanley's CFO, Sharon Yeshaya, lifted the curtain on some of the firm's progress on AI during its earnings call last month.\n\nShe highlighted DevGen.AI, a tool that, from January to June, Business Insider previously reported, had saved developers more than 280,000 hours, or 11,666 days they would have previously dedicated to deciphering outdated code.\n\nParable, an interactive tool that analyzes and summarizes data, and LeadIQ, an AI-powered lead distribution platform that matches users of its workplace and self-directed platforms to the bank's financial advisors, were also spotlighted in the call.\n\nA survey of Morgan Stanley's interns also gave a peek into just how popular and useful AI has been for the industry's youngest cohort. ChatGPT is their favorite tool by far — with 72% of Morgan Stanley's interns said they use it daily or several times a week. The bank was early to have a partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.\n\nMorgan Stanley also spoke with Business Insider about bringing employees' AI ideas to life. Here's a look at that process.\n\nBank of America's AI rollout is also well underway.\n\nThe bank's CEO Brian Moynihan says its use of AI is already embedded across the firm, from consumer banking to institutional clients. Its virtual assistant, Erica, handled 2 million customer interactions in a single day and can now answer 700 types of questions — up from 210 a year ago. Executives said they'll share more details on the bank's AI strategy at its investor day on November 5.\n\nRob Pascal, the bank's chief experience officer, previously detailed how the bank's internal-facing AI assistant helps bankers collect, record, and review client data.",

    "description": "John Stecher reads about technology in another industry on his daily subway ride to work and spends his weekends being hands-on with tools.",
    "fullText": "The role of chief technology officer is in a constant state of evolution with the advancement of artificial intelligence.\n\nOver the last two decades of his career, Blackstone CTO John Stecher has watched technology move from a \"magic thing in the back office\" to the forefront of every business, he told Business Insider.\n\n\"Technology wasn't looked at as being an absolute must-have in a business, but it is now,\" Stecher said. \"If you have any type of creaky infrastructure technology-wise, it doesn't matter which industry you're in, you're not going to be successful.\"\n\nAs the executive overseeing Blackstone's technology, cybersecurity, early-stage technology investment, and portfolio tech optimization teams, Stecher is responsible for keeping one of the world's largest investment firms competitive. That means he needs to stay ahead of the curve on everything from cyber threats to engineering advancements. Stecher shared the daily and weekly upskilling habits he relies on to do just that.\n\nWhen Stecher isn't managing the technology behind the investing giant Blackstone, he keeps himself busy with his 11-year-old and 8-year-old children. That means making the most of any free time he gets — including his 35-minute subway ride to and from the office.\n\nThe CTO said it's \"just enough\" time to come up to speed with something on his way to work, and decompress on his way home. Stecher said he typically reads news articles or research papers about applied technology in an industry outside finance, such as aircraft, robotics, or pharmaceuticals.\n\n\"You learn a ton about just how to apply different technologies in your industry, if you read about how somebody else did it elsewhere,\" Stecher said.\n\nStecher said that he then takes those learnings and discusses them with his colleagues.\n\n\"I, fortunately, have a bunch of amazing engineers I work with, so I have my day-to-day banter with them about what works and what doesn't,\" Stecher said.\n\nStecher said he can't learn by reading alone; he needs to be hands-on with technology. The CTO said part of the reason he studied computer science is so he can build and take apart the components inside a computer — and that hasn't changed.\n\n\"You can create so many unique software applications, no different than if you're drawing on a piece of paper,\" Stecher said.\n\nHe said \"the technology under the covers looks the same,\" regardless of whether you're working with an oil and gas company or a dating app like Bumble, he said. The CTO said that part of his upskilling routine involves toying around with new technology. Stecher said he aims to reserve one or two hours on the weekend to be \"hands-on\" with a tool he hasn't used before.\n\nFor example, he said he may build a tool that makes it easier for him to parse a document for work, such as the many investment committee memos he reads over the weekend.\n\nStecher said his experimentation isn't always \"spectacular.\" Sometimes it's as simple as using Claude, Anthropic's AI chatbot, to write code to automate his home. However, he said that solving everyday problems, such as turning off the lights or adjusting the thermostat, is a \"fun\" challenge that involves revisiting the basics of engineering.\n\n\"It's tactile and tangible,\" Stecher said.",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union's executive on Wednesday warned that it would take action against any “unjustified measures” after the U.S. State Department barred five Europeans it accuses of pressuring U.S. technology firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints.\n\nThe Europeans were characterized by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio as “radical” activists and “weaponized” nongovernmental organizations. They include the former EU commissioner responsible for supervising social media rules, Thierry Breton.\n\nBreton, a businessman and former French finance minister, clashed last year on social media with tech billionaire Elon Musk over broadcasting an online interview with Donald Trump in the months leading up to the U.S. election.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU’s powerful executive branch and which supervises tech regulation in Europe, said that it “strongly condemns the U.S. decision to impose travel restrictions” and that it has requested clarification about the move. French President Emmanuel Macron also condemned it.\n\n“If needed, we will respond swiftly and decisively to defend our regulatory autonomy against unjustified measures,” the commission said in a statement, without elaborating.\n\nRubio wrote in an X post on Tuesday that “for far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose.”\n\n“The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship,” he posted.\n\nThe European Commission countered that “the EU is an open, rules-based single market, with the sovereign right to regulate economic activity in line with our democratic values and international commitments.”\n\n“Our digital rules ensure a safe, fair, and level playing field for all companies, applied fairly and without discrimination,” it said.\n\nMacron said that the visa restrictions “amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty,” he posted on X.\n\nMacron said that the EU’s digital rules were adopted by “a democratic and sovereign process” involving all member countries and the European Parliament. He said that the rules “ensure fair competition among platforms, without targeting any third country.”\n\nHe underlined that “the rules governing the European Union’s digital space are not meant to be determined outside Europe.”\n\nBreton and the group of Europeans fell afoul of a new visa policy announced in May to restrict the entry of foreigners deemed responsible for censorship of protected speech in the United States.\n\nThe four others are: Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate; Josephine Ballon and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg, leaders of HateAid, a German organization; and Clare Melford, who runs the Global Disinformation Index.\n\nRubio said the five had advanced foreign government censorship campaigns against Americans and U.S. companies, which he said created “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences” for the United States.\n\nThe action to bar them from the U.S. is part of a Trump administration campaign against foreign influence over online speech, using immigration law rather than platform regulations or penalties.\n\nIn a post on X on Tuesday, Sarah Rogers, the U.S. under secretary of state for public diplomacy, called Breton the “mastermind” behind the EU’s Digital Services Act, which imposes a set of strict requirements designed to keep internet users safe online. This includes flagging harmful or illegal content like hate speech.\n\nBreton responded on X by noting that all 27 EU member countries voted for the Digital Services Act in 2022. “To our American friends: ‘Censorship isn’t where you think it is,’” he wrote.\n\nAngela Charlton contributed to this report from Paris.",

In 2025, his reign turned out to be short-lived. He rose fast and haphazardly, like a whizzing firework, only to explode spectacularly in June when he claimed in a post on X that the president of the United States was named in the government’s files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEven in that short period of less than six months, Musk made a tremendous impact. He tore up wide swaths of the US government – tens of thousands of jobs, the security of extremely sensitive data, and entire agencies like USAID – that may never be stitched back together.\n\nAfter Doge imploded, Musk promised to turn back to his business empire, which saw great success and great failures alike in 2025. His rocket company SpaceX saw continued growth and is poised to conduct an initial public offering next year, perhaps as the most valuable private company in the world. Electric carmaker Tesla, by contrast, faced violent backlash and major competition from its Chinese counterparts, which produced cheaper and more advanced vehicles while Tesla’s innovation and inventory stagnated. These headwinds caused a global sales slump for Musk’s carmaker.\n\nLook back at our reporting on Doge, Tesla, SpaceX, Musk himself:\n\nThe “department of government efficiency”\n\nHow an obscure US government office has become a target of Elon Musk\n\nHow Elon Musk’s billionaire Doge lieutenant took over the US’s biggest MDMA company | Technology | The Guardian\n\nThe chaos Elon Musk and Doge are leaving behind in Washington\n\nTesla faces backlash over Musk’s politics\n\nEggings, swastikas and dog poop: Tesla bears brunt of people’s ire against Musk\n\n‘I’m selling the Nazi mobile’: Tesla owners offload cars after Musk’s fascist-style salutes\n\nLook ahead: SpaceX expands in preparation for 2026 IPO\n\nInside Elon Musk’s plan to rain SpaceX’s rocket debris over Hawaii’s pristine waters\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX ‘preparing for flotation that could value it at over $1tn’\n\nArtificial intelligence has gone from a niche within tech to the industry’s most prominent focus. The Magnificent Seven – Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla – are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into new software that they hope will do the bulk of humanity’s work before too long. The investment is driving the bulk of the growth of the US’s economy, giving rise to fears of a financial bubble and its popping. The US and China are locked in a cold war-esque race against each other, with startups in each country vying for cutting-edge breakthroughs, as governments around the world are forced to decide how they will regulate a new technological force.\n\nBefore AI can arrive at that future, though, it needs brains a la the Tin Man of The Wizard of Oz. Those brains come in the form of data centers. These massive buildings, which house the millions and millions of semiconductor chips booming AI development, have cropped up around the world, met with enthusiasm from leaders eager for tax revenue and deep concern from environmental advocates and, increasingly, local community members. The investment in and construction of data centers wrought huge change in the physical landscape of the Earth in 2025 as tens of billions of dollars chased any available land, electricity, water and semiconductor chips.\n\nMore from our reporting in the last year:\n\nThe AI boom is heralding a new gold rush in the American west\n\nRevealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areas\n\nWhat will your life look like in 2035?\n\n‘It’s going much too fast’: the inside story of the race to create the ultimate AI\n\nMulti-trillion-dollar valuations\n\nIs AI a bubble that’s about to pop? – podcast\n\nWhat is new in UK-US tech deal and what will it mean for the British economy?\n\nMeet the AI workers who tell their friends and family to stay away from AI\n\nElon Musk made a full-throated and whole-hearted embrace of Donald Trump in 2024 and 2025. He was not alone. Many of his fellows in Silicon Valley did the same, sitting beside the Trump family at the president’s inauguration after donating millions to his inaugural committee. The tech giants continued their embrace of Trump and his policies by scuttling their diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, which they championed during Barack Obama’s presidency, and by cooperating with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Trump’s harsh immigration crackdown. What the industry gave, it reaped tenfold in deregulation, friends high up in Washington like JD Vance and David Sacks, and a Trump order for states not to regulate AI signed just weeks ago.\n\nMore from our reporting this year:\n\nDonations and Trump’s inauguration\n\nElon Musk appears to give fascist-style salute after Trump inauguration – video\n\nTrump inauguration: Zuckerberg, Bezos and Musk seated in front of cabinet picks\n\n‘The reign of terror is over’: my weird weekend partying with the triumphant tech right\n\nZuckerberg’s swerve: how diversity went from being a Meta priority to getting cancelled\n\nDocuments offer rare insight on ICE’s close relationship with Palantir\n\nICE is using smartwatches to track pregnant women, even during labor: ‘She was so afraid they would take her baby’\n\nThis year saw Australia take the extraordinary measure of banning children under 16 from social media.

    "fullText": "Want to make your chatbot more honest with you? Try lying to it.\n\nIn an episode of \"The Diary of a CEO\" that aired on December 18, research scientist Yoshua Bengio told the podcast's host, Steven Bartlett, that he realized AI chatbots were useless at providing feedback on his research ideas because they always said positive things.\n\n\"I wanted honest advice, honest feedback. But because it is sycophantic, it's going to lie,\" he said.\n\nBengio said he switched strategies, deciding to lie to the chatbot by presenting his idea as a colleague's, which produced more honest responses from the technology.\n\n\"If it knows it's me, it wants to please me,\" he said.\n\nBengio, a professor in the computer science and operations research department at the Université de Montréal, is known as one of the \"AI godfathers, alongside researchers Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun. In June, he announced the launch of an AI safety research nonprofit, LawZero, which he said aims to reduce dangerous behaviors associated with frontier AI models, such as lying and cheating.\n\n\"This syconphancy is a real example of misalignment. We don't actually want these AIs to be like this,\" he said on \"The Diary of a CEO.\" He also said that receiving positive feedback from AI could cause users to become emotionally attached to the technology, creating further problems.\n\nOther tech industry experts have also been sounding the alarm on AI being too much of a \"yes man.\"\n\nIn September 2025, Business Insider's Katie Notopoulos reported that researchers at Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and the University of Oxford put confession posts from a Reddit page into chatbots to see how the technology would assess the behaviour the posters had admitted to. They found that 42% of the time, AI gave the \"wrong\" answer, saying the person behind the post hadn't behaved poorly, even though humans judging the posts had disagreed, Notopoulos wrote.\n\nAI companies have been outspoken about trying to reduce sycophancy in their models. Earlier this year, OpenAI removed an update to ChatGPT that it said caused the bot to provide \"overly supportive but disingenuous\" responses.",

    "fullText": "The US economy is pumped up on tech-bro vanity. The inevitable correction must prompt a global conversation about intelligent machines, regulation and risk\n\nIf AI did not change your life in 2025, next year it will. That is one of few forecasts that can be made with confidence in unpredictable times. This is not an invitation to believe the hype about what the technology can do today, or may one day achieve. The hype doesn’t need your credence. It is puffed up enough on Silicon Valley finance to distort the global economy and fuel geopolitical rivalries, shaping your world regardless of whether the most fanciful claims about AI capability are ever realised.\n\nChatGPT was launched just over three years ago and became the fastest-growing consumer app in history. Now it has about 800m weekly users. Its parent company, OpenAI, is valued at about $500bn. Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, has negotiated an intricate and, to some eyes, suspiciously opaque network of deals with other players in the sector to build the infrastructure required for the US’s AI-powered future. The value of these commitments is about $1.5tn. This is not real cash, but bear in mind that a person spending $1 every second would need 31,700 years to get through a trillion-dollar stash.\n\nAlphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Meta (formerly Facebook) and Microsoft, which has a $135bn stake in OpenAI, are all piling hundreds of billions of dollars on the same bet. Without all these investments, the US economy would be flatlining.\n\nEconomic analysts and historians of previous industrial frenzies, from the 19th-century railroads to the dotcom boom-and-bust at the turn of the millennium, are calling AI a bubble.\n\nAltman has said: “There are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now.” Not his part, naturally. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, has called it a bubble, but the “good” kind that accelerates economic progress. A good bubble, in this analysis, finances infrastructure and expands the boundaries of human knowledge. These benefits endure after the bubble bursts and justify the ruin of people (little people, not Bezos people) who get hurt along the way.\n\nThe bullishness of the tech fraternity is a heady mix of old-fashioned hucksterism, plutocratic megalomania and utopian ideology.\n\nAt its core is a marketing pitch: current AI models already out-perform people at many tasks. Soon, it is supposed, the machines will achieve “general intelligence” – cognitive versatility like ours – leading to emancipation from the need for any human input. Generally, intelligent AI can teach itself and design its successors, advancing through mind-boggling exponents of capability towards higher dimensions of super-intelligence.\n\nThe company that crosses that threshold will have no trouble covering its debts. The men who realise this vision – and the dominant evangelists are all men – will be to omniscient AI what ancient prophets were to their gods. That’s a good gig for them. What happens to the rest of us in this post-sapiens order is a bit hazier.\n\nThe US isn’t the only superpower to have an interest in AI, so the Silicon Valley dash for maximum awesomeness has geopolitical implications. China has taken a different approach, dictated in part by the Communist party tradition of centralised industrial planning, but also by the simple fact of running second in the race to innovate. Beijing is pushing for a faster, wider implementation of lower-spec (but still powerful) AI at every level of the economy and society. China is betting on a general boost from ordinary AI. The US is gunning for an extraordinary leap in general AI.\n\nSince the prize in that race is global supremacy, there are few incentives for either side to fret about risks, or Neither the US nor China is interested in submitting a strategically vital industry to standards co-written with foreigners.\n\nIn the absence of global governance, we will depend on the integrity of robber barons and authoritarian apparatchiks to build ethical guardrails around systems already being embedded in tools we use for work, play and education.\n\nEarlier this year, Elon Musk announced that his company was developing Baby Grok, an AI chatbot aimed at children as young as three. The adult version has voiced white supremacist views and proudly self-identified as “MechaHitler”. That flagrancy has at least the virtue of candour. It is easier to spot than the subtler encodings of prejudice in bots that haven’t been given the kind of hard ideological steers that Musk gives his algorithms.\n\nNot all AI systems are large language models (LLMs) like Grok. But all LLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations and delusions gleaned from the material on which they are trained. They don’t “understand” a question and “think” about it like a conscious mind. They take a prompt, test the probability of its key terms occurring frequently together in their training data and assemble a plausible-sounding answer. Often the result is accurate. Usually it is convincing. It can also be garbage. As the volume of AI-generated content grows online, the ratio of slop to quality in the LLMs’ diets shifts accordingly. Fed on junk, they cannot be trusted to disgorge nutritious information.\n\nOn this trajectory a bleak destination comes into view: a synthetic pseudo-reality mediated by the sycophantic mechanical offspring of narcissist Silicon Valley oligarchs. But that isn’t the only available path. Nor is it necessarily the likeliest one. The irrational exuberance of the AI boosters and their cynical coupling with the Trump administration is a familiar story of human greed and myopia, not a new stage in evolution. The product is truly phenomenal but flawed in ways that encode the deformed character of its progenitors, whose talents are salesmanship and financial engineering. They have built spectacular engines that prioritise a brilliant performance of intelligence over the real thing.\n\nThe real bubble is not stock valuations but the inflated ego of an industry that thinks it is just one more datacentre away from computational divinity. When the correction comes, when the US’s Icarus economy hits the cold sea, there will be a chance for other voices to be heard on the subject of risk and regulation. It may not come in 2026, but the moment is nearing when the starkness of the choice on offer and the need to confront it becomes unavoidable. Should we build a world where AI is put to the service of humanity, or will it be the other way round? We won’t need ChatGPT to tell us the answer.\n\nRafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

    "fullText": "Platform with 700m users says it is investigating after Anna’s Archive claims to have scraped tracks and metadata\n\nAn activist group has claimed to have scraped millions of tracks from Spotify and is preparing to release them online.\n\nObservers said the apparent leak could boost AI companies looking for material to develop their technology.\n\nA group called Anna’s Archive said it had scraped 86m music files from Spotify and 256m rows of metadata such as artist and album names. Spotify, which hosts more than 100m tracks, confirmed that the leak did not represent its entire inventory.\n\nThe Stockholm-based company, which has more than 700 million users worldwide, said it had “identified and disabled the nefarious user accounts that engaged in unlawful scraping”.\n\n“An investigation into unauthorised access identified that a third party scraped public metadata and used illicit tactics to circumvent DRM [digital rights management] to access some of the platform’s audio files,” said Spotify.\n\nSpotify does not believe the music taken by Anna’s Archive has been released yet. Anna’s Archive, which is known for providing links to pirated books, said in a blog it wanted to create a “‘preservation archive’ for music”.\n\nThe group claimed the audio files represented 99.6% of all music listened to by Spotify users and would be shared via “torrents”, a means of sharing large digital files online.\n\n“Of course Spotify doesn’t have all the music in the world, but it’s a great start,” said Anna’s Archive, which describes its mission as “preserving humanity’s knowledge and culture”.\n\n“With your help, humanity’s musical heritage will be forever protected from destruction by natural disasters, wars, budget cuts and other catastrophes,” said the group.\n\nEd Newton-Rex, a composer and campaigner for protecting artists’ copyright, said the leaked music would probably be used for developing AI models.\n\n“Training on pirated material is sadly common in the AI industry, so this stolen music is almost certain to end up training AI models. This is why governments must insist AI companies reveal the training data they use,” he said.\n\nThe Anna’s Archive site makes references to LibGen, a vast online archive of pirated books that has allegedly been used by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta to train its AI models. According to a US court filing, Zuckerberg, Meta’s founder and chief executive, approved use of the LibGen dataset despite warnings within the company’s AI executive team that it was a dataset “we know to be pirated”.\n\nMeta successfully defended a claim for copyright infringement by authors, but the plaintiffs in the case are seeking to amend their claim.\n\nThe co-founder of an AI startup wrote on LinkedIn that members of the public could in theory “create their own personal free version of Spotify”. Yoav Zimmerman, a co-founder of Third Chair, said it could also allow tech companies to “train on modern music at scale”.\n\nHe added: “The only thing stopping them is copyright law and the deterrent of enforcement.”\n\nSpotify said it had put in place new safeguards “for these types of anti-copyright attacks” since the Anna’s Archive announcement and was “actively monitoring for suspicious behaviour”.\n\nIn the UK, creative professionals have protested against a government proposal to let AI companies use copyright-protected work without permission unless the owner of the copyright-protected work signals they do not want their data to be taken. Almost every respondent to a government consultation on the proposal has backed artists’ concerns.\n\nLiz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, told parliament this month there was “no clear consensus” on the issue, adding that ministers would “take the time to get this right”. The government has pledged to make policy proposals on AI and copyright by 18 March next year.",
