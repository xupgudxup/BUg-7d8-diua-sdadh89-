    "fullText": "Mark Cuban has an idea for how to stop the runaway train that is the $38 trillion national debt, and it has a lot to do with the online pharmacy company he founded in January 2022. On Christmas Eve, the billionaire investor posted on X about his frustrations with the insurance market.\n\nInsurers and providers, according to Cuban, “play on the fear and information asymmetry that exists in healthcare.” He advocated for them to be broken up, so as to “make the markets efficient again.”\n\nWhile Cuban’s proposal focused on $100 fines for insurers that over-bill or deny care, the broader thrust of his argument is dismantling opaque middlemen and forcing transparent pricing—as he does with his Cost Plus Drugs pharmacy—could help tame one of the biggest drivers of America’s fiscal strain.​\n\nAmerica’s national debt surged past $38 trillion in October, adding roughly $1 trillion in just over two months in 2025—twice the pace of typical growth since 2000, according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a leading fiscal watchdog. Annual interest payments are already around $1 trillion and could total as much as $14 trillion over the coming decade, a trajectory the watchdog warns is “no way for a great nation like America to run its finances.” A closer look at health insurance and over-billing doesn’t exactly find fixing the issue would fix the debt or deficit​, but Cuban is right that something is definitely off in this space.\n\nCost Plus Drugs sells medications at their manufacturing cost, plus a flat 15% markup, a small pharmacy fee, and a posted shipping charge. The company cuts out traditional pharmacy benefit managers and negotiates directly with manufacturers, publishing acquisition costs and formulas so customers can see exactly how their prices are built.​\n\nFortune and other outlets have reported Cost Plus Drugs can slash the price of some generics from thousands of dollars a month to double‑digit sums, especially for patients who are uninsured or stuck with high deductibles. Cuban argues if similar transparency and direct‑to‑consumer models were applied across health care—combined with rules like letting cash prices count toward insurance deductibles—the country could strip out layers of waste that burden both families and, ultimately, public budgets.",

A firm release date hasn't been set, but the Ultimate 3E is currently slated for Q2 2026 (April-June).\nIf you're eager to get your hands on 8BitDo's first modular controller, be prepared to spend considerably more than you did on the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 or any other traditional controller from the popular accessory maker. The 8BitDo Ultimate 3E will retail for $150, placing it squarely in competition with Microsoft's own Elite Series 2 and other licensed Xbox controllers such as the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro, Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded, Nacon Revolution X Unlimited, Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra, Scuf Valor Pro, and GameSir G7 Pro.",

    "title": "I've made 5 career pivots across music, retail, and startups. I reset my goals every few years — but 1 thing never changes.",
    "description": "Ryan Edwards was a drummer for an indie band, worked at VISA Europe, and now runs Audoo, a music tech startup. Here's his advice on career pivots.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ryan Edwards, 40, the founder of Audoo, who is based in London. His employment and Audoo's investors have been verified by Business Insider. This piece has been edited for length and clarity\n\nIn my early 20s, I was the drummer of an indie band. We toured festivals and made the UK's Top 10 Independent Singles Chart.\n\nBut I knew our success wouldn't last forever. Eventually, the time would come for me to grow up and find a real job.\n\nSince leaving the band in 2008, my career has been varied. I've worked in retail, at startups, and eventually became a senior leader at Visa Europe. In 2018, I founded Audoo, a startup that aims to help musicians receive royalties, which has investors including Elton John.\n\nMy career pivots have been unexpected and I tend to fall into my line of work, but they have felt natural because my dreams keep changing. While my job titles have changed, one thing hasn't: a belief in getting my head down and doing the hard work. In my experience, nine times out of ten, that's what pays off.\n\nAs a kid, I dreamed of being a footballer — then I got into music. My dad loves Motown and he wanted me to become a saxophonist. I started learning the clarinet and the sax, and then the drums, because I thought it might get me more girls.\n\nI planned to study jazz at music school, but that never happened. Soon after I finished my high-school exams, the band I was the drummer of was signed by an indie label while gigging locally. When I heard the words \"record deal,\" I got goosebumps.\n\nFrom 2006, we were suddenly getting studio time and supporting major acts on tour. Looking back, touring for a year and a half was probably a better life experience than going to university: I became a better musician and learned how to drink.\n\nBand life was fun, but it wasn't always easy. I remember renting budget hotel rooms and flipping a coin to see who would sleep on the floor. Eventually, it became clear that the label would prioritize better-selling and more well-behaved bands.\n\nPanic set in when I left the band. I didn't know what to do with my life, but I knew I needed an income. I got a job as an assistant store manager at a cell phone retailer chain in 2008, where I ended up working for four years in increasingly senior roles.\n\nWorking in retail was an excellent education: you're trading day in, day out. There were similarities to life in the band, where I'd sell T-shirts and stickers after shows. In both lines of work, I managed stock and convinced people to part with their hard-earned cash.\n\nI was made redundant in 2012, and after a stint as a business development manager at an app development business — whose founder I met at a friend's wedding — I was offered a job at Visa Europe as a senior manager in late 2013.\n\nI learned to always be open to exploring new opportunities. You never know where they might take you.\n\nIt was my first job in a corporate environment. Suddenly, I was sitting in a three-piece suit at a quiet desk, worrying it would be stale, but I ended up being given permission to shake things up.\n\nI hadn't planned to leave Visa — the pay was great and I felt comfortable in my job. But in 2016, after three years, I joined a fintech start-up in sales, after two brilliant guys tried to poach me. They knew of me from working on Visa data feeds, and needed contacts in retail.\n\nThe risk of pivoting felt worth it because the idea for the business was amazing.\n\nThen the idea for Audoo hit me. In 2018, I was in a department store in London when one of my band's singles started playing, and my wife joked about the royalties I'd earn. I said they were more likely to buy her a coffee than the designer bag she was eyeing up.\n\nWeeks later, I got my royalty statement. It listed what I'd been paid but offered no data about how those payments were calculated or the flow of how plays become payment. I became fascinated by how the royalties process worked — and realized the system was a mess.\n\nInspired by Amazon's Alexa and Shazam, I wanted to build a technology that would identify the music played in public and ensure artists get paid fairly for it. I built the first prototype for Audoo on my kitchen table with a Raspberry Pi. It worked — it recognized songs —but, looking back, it was embarrassing. We use barely any of that code anymore.\n\nNow, our Audoo Audio Meter uses a plug-in device to track the music played in commercial premises, like stores and bars, and sends the data to royalty-collection organizations.\n\nI incorporated Audoo in August 2018 at the age of 33. We'd just gotten a puppy and my wife was pregnant, so I needed it to work. I used LinkedIn to reach out to industry leaders and set up coffee dates, which quickly confirmed there was demand to build and scale the product.\n\nIn 2020, Björn Ulvaeus of ABBA saw me on TV promoting Audoo and later invested. He put out a statement that exceeded my expectations: \"Audoo is a solution I believe will change the music industry forever,\" he said.\n\nThrough word of mouth, others in the music industry started to hear about the company and invest, including Elton John.\n\nThe team and the mission we're delivering are incredibly rewarding — but I'm always open to new challenges.\n\nWhen I was a drummer in The Lines, I never thought I'd one day be the CEO of a music tech company. I can't say where the future will take me as I've never been one to stick to a particular plan.\n\nWhile some people have lifelong linear goals, I tend to reset mine every two to three years. For me, it's about continually learning something new, never being boxed in, and being adaptable to change.",

    "title": "Walmart salary data revealed: How much the retail giant pays designers, software engineers, and other tech workers",
    "description": "See how much Walmart pays in 2025, with software engineers earning as much as $286,000. Salary data shows pay ranges across tech and analytics teams.",
    "fullText": "Walmart is trying to transform itself from America's grocery store into a global tech titan and is reshaping its workforce in the process.\n\nThe 63-year-old company has been the largest retailer in the world for decades and has held the top spot on the Fortune 500 list since 2013. But it has also invested heavily over the past several years in becoming a powerhouse of e-commerce and retail media.\n\nSalary data shows how serious Walmart is about competing with the likes of Amazon, Facebook, and Google for talent to beef up its tech.\n\nCompany filings with the US Labor Department show Walmart sought to hire more than 4,000 workers through the US H-1B visa program in the most recent reporting year, which ended September 30. Those workers were largely in software development, business intelligence, and IT. That number is up slightly from about 3,800 for the same period a year before.\n\nThis publicly available work visa data — which companies are required to disclose to the government — refers only to foreign hires and doesn't include equity or other benefits that employees can receive in addition to their base pay.\n\nIn addition to base salary, a Walmart spokesperson said that the company's compensation packages include bonus opportunities and stock awards and that the company invests in employees' career growth.\n\nStill, the reported pay rates are benchmarked against industry standards for US workers. That can shed light on how much Walmart employees earn in specific roles and where the company is looking to expand.\n\nAt the same time, the process for obtaining an H-1B visa is changing.\n\nPresident Donald Trump instituted a new $100,000 fee for the visa in September, and other proposed changes to H-1B visa rules would tilt the program in favor of the highest-paid applicants, lawyers told Business Insider.\n\nOther employers, including Amazon, submit work visa data, and Walmart's salaries are largely in line with those for similar roles at the e-commerce giant.\n\nAny changes to the H-1B visa program could have a significant impact on Walmart's workforce strategy.\n\nThe retail giant boasts a global workforce of 2.1 million people, of whom about 1.6 million are in the US, making it the largest private employer in both cases.\n\nMost of the company's open positions as of December were for jobs in Walmart stores and Sam's Club warehouses, while about 650 openings were for technology roles.\n\nThe company has been expanding in tech, hiring in July a new executive vice president of AI acceleration, product, and design who reports directly to the CEO, and recruiting for an EVP of AI platforms.\n\nMost of Walmart's white-collar jobs are based either in its Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters or in one of the company's satellite offices in the Bay Area. According to the H-1B data, about half of the positions are in Bentonville, while a third are in California, and most of the remainder are assigned to sites in Texas, New Jersey, Washington, and Virginia.\n\nHere's a deeper look at some of the roles and their annual base salaries:\n\nQuality engineer III: $64,730 to $117,000\n\nSoftware engineer III: $99,052 to $234,000\n\nSenior software engineer: $100,294 to $234,000\n\nStaff software engineer: $127,292 to $286,000\n\nPrincipal software engineer: $149,607 to $286,000\n\nSenior product manager: $121,000 to $234,000\n\nStaff product manager: $136,500 to $286,000\n\nPrincipal product manager: $166,962 to $286,000\n\nData scientist III: $98,800 to $234,000\n\nSenior data scientist: $124,176 to $234,000\n\nStaff data scientist: $138,333 to $338,000\n\nPrincipal data scientist: $158,642 to $286,000\n\nSenior design researcher: $142,002 to $234,000\n\nSenior UX designer: $111,000 to $234,000\n\nSenior manager, UX design: $183,227 to $286,000\n\nDirector, software engineering: $177,154 to $338,000\n\nDirector, data science: $169,000 to $338,000\n\nDirector, product management: $174,300 to $338,000\n\nSenior director, product management: $208,000 to $416,000\n\nGroup director, product management — international: $254,000 to $481,000",

    "description": "Silver prices rose as high as $84 an ounce as talk of an arbitrage play on China's pure-play silver fund gained traction on social media.",
    "fullText": "It's been a wild few weeks for silver.\n\nThe precious metal was already on a record-breaking run this year, and recently got a further boost from speculative interest among Chinese retail investors.\n\nThe price of the metal climbed to a new all-time high of $84 an ounce on Monday before erasing gains and trading lower.\n\nSilver, which is a key component in data centers and is seen as an under-the-radar AI play, has been piquing the interest of investors all year.\n\nBut speculative buying in China started just a couple of weeks ago, when a string of posts on the social media platform Xiaohongshu outlined how investors could start an arbitrage play on the UBS SDIC Silver Futures Fund, China's pure-play silver fund. (Arbitrage is a strategy that enables a trader to capitalize on the price difference of the same asset across different markets.)\n\nThat strategy evidently gained traction. In the past week, the fund was valued at over a 60% premium compared to the value of its assets, and at one point, was up 187% from levels at the start of the year, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nThis spike in Chinese interest can be seen in the spread between spot silver prices in Shanghai and in London, which briefly rose to more than $8 an ounce on Monday, the largest premium the metal has ever posted in China, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nOn Friday, UBS SDIC said it would shutter subscriptions to the fund's Class C shares, which are preferred among short-term traders. It also advised traders to avoid chasing \"unsustainable\" gains, and said rules around trading would become tighter.\n\nUBS SDIC did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.\n\nIt looks like there's a large number of speculators in net-short positions in silver, said Jeff de Graaf, a technical analyst and the CEO of Renaissance Macro.\n\n\"Net-short positions are negatively correlated to forward returns implying a potential short squeeze of speculators in silver markets,\" he wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\n\nIt isn't the first time silver has been the object of investor speculation. In October, silver futures hit a fresh record in London as traders staged a short squeeze on the metal, pushing its price to its first record high in over forty years.",

    "fullText": "The arts and crafts supply retail sector has faced store closings over the last five years for a variety of reasons, ranging from ownership retirements to severe financial distress.\n\nComing out of the Covid-19 pandemic, regional crafts retailer Beverly's Fabric & Crafts, which operated about 40 stores in California for 48 years, closed down all its stores in late 2020 when the chain's owners decided to retire, the San Luis Obispo Tribune reported at the time.\n\nCrafts and fabric retailer Joann started this year by filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2025 for a second time, suffering from declining sales and inventory challenges. It eventually revealed that it would close all of its stores, numbering about 815.\n\nJoann's demise affected crafts suppliers, including IG Design Group Americas Inc., which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 3, 2025, seeking going-concern sales of its business divisions and a wind-down of its operations.\n\nJoann’s decision to shut down all operations severely impacted IG Design Group’s business, making it difficult for the company to maintain historical operating results and adapt to market conditions despite turnaround initiatives.\n\nEconomic challenges are also affecting another longtime arts and crafts retailer.\n\n40-year-old arts and crafts supply retail chain Artist & Craftsman Supply has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy to reorganize, facing economic headwinds and tight lending restrictions, which severely strained the company's finances, according to Bondoro.\n\nThe 18-store, Portland, Maine-based chain's parent Artstock listed $10 million to $50 million in assets and liabilities in its petition, filed on Dec. 21, BankruptcyObserver reported.\n\nThe debtor owes Cambridge Savings Bank about $1.5 million on a $4 million revolving line of credit, Bondoro reported. It also owes the Small Business Administration about $1.9 million in debt on an SBA loan and about $65,000 in claims on credit card processing sales.\n\nArtist & Craftsman Supply, which was established in 1985, was founded as a small art supply store when the arts and crafts retail industry was dominated by the independent \"mom and pop\" storefronts that sold a combination of arts, crafts, stationery, hardware, and office supplies, according to its website.\n\nCatalog sales were a top competitor in the beginning, as internet-based companies and e-commerce were still about 10 years away from getting started.",

    "fullText": "2025 may go down as the end of an era in retail.\n\nThis was the year that the longtime CEOs at two of the largest chains decided to hand the reins over to their corporate proteges.\n\nThe retirements of Walmart's Doug McMillon and Target's Brian Cornell come as the industry is facing an array of new (and long-term) challenges in the form of a global trade rebalancing, accelerated adoption of AI, and increasingly stretched US household budgets.\n\nFresh legs might be a welcome addition in this race.\n\nDozens of smaller retailers have taken the opportunity to shake up the C-suite as well.\n\nAnalysis from leadership consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that 43 retail companies announced CEO exits in the first 10 months of this year, up from 32 in the same period last year. A few more announcements have come through since.\n\nHere are some of the major retail chains that are getting a new CEO in the new year.\n\nWalmart said in November that the company's US division CEO, John Furner, would become president and CEO on February 1.\n\nLike outgoing CEO Doug McMillon, Furner has been with Walmart for decades, starting as an hourly associate and working his way up through the ranks.\n\nTarget said in August that chief operating officer Michael Fiddelke would succeed Brian Cornell on February 1, with Cornell remaining on the board as Executive Chair.\n\nFiddelke has been with the company for 20 years, starting as a finance intern and moving through roles in merchandising, finance, operations, and human resources.\n\nRV dealer Camping World said in December that founder Marcus Lemonis would step down as CEO on January 1, with company president Matthew Wagner taking over.\n\nWagner has been with Camping World since 2007, serving in numerous leadership roles before being appointed chief operating officer in 2023 and president in 2024.\n\nKraft Heinz said in December that it has snagged Kellanova CEO Steve Cahillane to take over from Carlos Abrams-Rivera on January 1.\n\nThe company will later split into two publicly traded companies, North American Grocery Co. and Global Taste Elevation Co., with Cahillane remaining in charge of the latter.\n\nCahillane has a long career leading consumer products companies like The Nature's Bounty Co. and Coca-Cola's Americas division. He also spent eight years with AB InBev.\n\nIn fairness, Michael Bender's transition effectively happened back in May, but Kohl's made it official in late November when the retailer said Bender would go from interim CEO to a permanent appointment.\n\nThat means Kohl's will start the new year with one less distraction under the leadership of a highly experienced retail executive who has already had a positive impact on the company.\n\nAthleisure brand Lululemon said in December that it was parting ways with CEO Calvin McDonald on January 31, but hasn't yet identified a permanent successor.\n\nIn the meantime, the company said board chair Marti Morfitt would expand her role to become executive chair, and that CFO Meghan Frank, chief commercial officer André Maestrini would serve as interim co-CEOs following McDonald's departure.\n\nParent company Seven & i Holdings said in December that CEO Joe DePinto would retire at the end of the year. The company's current president, Stan Reynolds, and chief operating officer, Doug Rosencrans, are set to serve as co-CEOs until a permanent successor is hired.",

    "fullText": "Retailers are gearing up for another wave of store closures.\n\nIt's shaping up to be the continuation of a retail pullback that Business Insider tracked in 2024 and 2025. Major chains, from department store Macy's to grocery chain Kroger, have already announced multiyear closure plans that extend into 2026, as have some niche stores.\n\nMany companies, such as Macy's, are closing their physical stores to invest more resources into their online businesses.\n\nIn 2025, Business Insider tracked around 4,100 closures as of late December. Retail data and consultant firm Coresight Research predicted earlier in the year that roughly 15,000 retail locations would close in the year.\n\nSo far for 2026, Business Insider has identified roughly 270 planned closures.\n\nSee the list of major closures below.\n\nCarter's, one of North America's biggest children's and baby apparel retailers, said in October that it plans to close 150 stores across the region over the next three years as leases expire, including about 100 by the end of 2026.\n\nIn January 2025, Macy's said it planned to close 150 locations through 2026, allowing it to focus on its best-performing locations and online experience. After the closures are complete, there will be about 350 Macy's stores left. Macy's closed at least 66 stores in 2025.\n\nGrocery giant Kroger said in June 2025 that it planned to close 60 \"unprofitable\" stores across the US over the next 18 months. The company said in September that it had begun that process.\n\nThe company said in its last annual report that it operated 2,731 supermarkets in 35 states and Washington, DC, as of February 2025.\n\nNewell Brands said in December 2025 that it would close 20 Yankee Candle stores in the US and Canada beginning in January 2026. The closures were announced alongside the reduction of its workforce by over 900 employees.\n\n\"This productivity plan is about taking the next, disciplined step to enhance efficiency, sharpen our strategic focus, and deliver stronger, more consistent performance,\" CEO Chris Peterson said in a press release.\n\nSaks Off 5th, a luxury outlet retailer offering discounted designer brands, told Business Insider that it plans to close select stores in early 2026. The closures include stores in nine locations.\n\n\"We are confident this will better position the Saks Off 5th business for long-term success and look forward to continuing to deliver for our customers,\" a spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\nREI confirmed to Business Insider that it plans to close three stores, starting with a location in New Jersey, in the first quarter of 2026. Its stores in New York City's SoHo neighborhood and Boston are set to follow in late 2026.\n\n\"As markets and customer needs evolve, we must adapt to position the co-op for long-term success,\" the company said in a statement.",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nFor bargain hunters, Costco has long been a go-to destination. The warehouse giant famously still sells its hot dog and soda combo for $1.50 — the same price it launched with back in the mid-1980s. But not every Costco item has held its price as stubbornly as the hot dog combo.\n\nIn late 2023, Costco began selling 1-ounce gold bars. At the time, shoppers could choose between two types: the PAMP Suisse Lady Fortuna Veriscan bar and the Rand Refinery bar, priced at $1,979.99 and $1,949.99, respectively, according to Business Insider. Despite the hefty price tag, both quickly became hot sellers (1).\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers.

Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nFast forward to today, and not much has changed — except the price.\n\nAs of December 2025, the Pamp Suisse bar sells for $4,119.99, an increase of 108% (2).\n\nThe jump in price is in line with the broader gold market, which has surged roughly 65% over the course of 2025. What’s more surprising is the continued demand.\n\nCustomers are now restricted to “one transaction per membership, with a maximum of 4 units per 24 hours”, according to the Costco website (3).\n\nGold has long been viewed as a way to preserve purchasing power. Unlike fiat currencies, it can’t be printed at will by central banks.\n\nIt’s also considered a classic safe haven. Gold isn’t tied to any one country, currency or economy, and in times of economic turmoil or geopolitical uncertainty, investors often flock to it — driving prices higher.\n\nThat’s exactly what appears to be happening now. Markets are getting whipsawed by tariff uncertainty, rising deficits and global tensions — and gold has emerged as a rare bright spot.\n\nRay Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, also highlighted gold’s importance as part of a resilient portfolio.\n\n“People don't have, typically, an adequate amount of gold in their portfolio,” he told CNBC. “When bad times come, gold is a very effective diversifier (4).”\n\nGold hit a peak price of $4,371.78 per ounce in October, and many experts expect it to continue to rise as stock market outlooks get shaky (5).",

    "fullText": "Managing a business is challenging, even in the best circumstances. In today's uncertain economy, marked by slowing consumer spending and shifting retail habits, it becomes even tougher.\n\nFor one retail chain, the difficulty has been compounded by years of financial strain, two Chapter 11 bankruptcies, and hundreds of store closures nationwide.\n\nOnce an iconic mall staple known for its affordable jewelry, colorful hair accessories, and quirky novelties, Claire's is again facing serious financial setbacks. A new revelation has raised doubts about the long-term survival of the 64-year-old brand, which once played a significant role in the lives of countless teens and tweens.\n\nAs it works to emerge from its second bankruptcy under new ownership by the private equity firm Ames Watson, Claire's is confronting additional pressures from its supply chain. Several Asian suppliers allege they are owed millions of dollars in unpaid debts, according to claims filed in Hong Kong and reported by CNBC.\n\nThe disputed orders were for holiday merchandise placed before Claire's second bankruptcy filing, when Elliott Management still owned the company. Suppliers were reportedly aware of the retailer's financial instability at the time the orders were made. However, by the time production was completed, Claire's had already filed for bankruptcy.\n\nAfter Ames Watson acquired the brand, some suppliers claimed they were still owed payment, but agreed to continue doing business with Claire's. Others chose to pursue legal action against Claire's Hong Kong-based sourcing office, RSI International.\n\nAs a major American retail chain, Claire's is a prominent customer for many of these Asian suppliers. This is why, despite outstanding balances, several vendors continued to fulfill orders out of fear that refusing to do so could jeopardize their business relationship with the retailer.\n\nDuring its latest acquisition process, RSI International notified creditors that they had 30 days to file claims to recover unpaid debts, liabilities that under Hong Kong Law do not transfer to new owners.\n\nIn a statement to CNBC, Ames Watson emphasized it was \"not involved in the operation or purchasing decisions made prior to the acquisition.\"\n\n\"Since then, we have focused on responsibly stewarding the business and engaging suppliers in good faith as we strengthen Claire's for the long term,\" said Ames Watson. \"We are excited about the company’s direction in 2026.\"\n\nClaire's first filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2018, emerging later that year under the new ownership of Elliott Management Corp. and Monarch Alternative Capital.",

    "fullText": "The craft beer industry has suffered a devastating year in 2025, as over 250 breweries in the U.S. closed down permanently in the first six months of the year.\n\nMost craft breweries blamed rising costs, slowing taproom traffic, and fierce retail competition as the reasons for their demise, American Craft Beer reported.\n\nThe number of craft breweries operating in the U.S. declined from 9,747 in 2023 to 9,269 in June 2025, the Brewers Association reported, and the number continues to decline.\n\nSeveral craft brewers have liquidated and closed in Chapter 7 this year, including St. Petersburg, Fla.-based brewery Dissent Craft Brewing, which filed for liquidation in August; Exton, Pa.-based Iron Hill Brewery LLC and San Jose, Calif.-based Strike Brewing Company, which both filed petitions in October; and Oregon-based Rogue Ales & Spirits, which filed Chapter 7 in November.\n\nOne of the most prominent craft brewery closings was Albuquerque, N.M.-based Bosque Brewing Company, which filed for Chapter 11 protection in October 2025 and closed two of its 11 New Mexico establishments in December.\n\nAnd now, popular Ohio beer brand and brewery Entropy Brewing Company posted on social media that it will not make it to New Year's Eve as it closes down its business permanently on Dec. 27, 2025.\n\nThe Miamisburg, Ohio, craft brewery, restaurant, and bar revealed in a Dec. 12 Facebook post that it will shut down operations on Dec. 27, but did not state a reason for closing.\n\n\"We have an important update to share: Entropy Brewing Co. will be closing on December 27, 2025. We are deeply grateful for the incredible support this community has shown us. Thank you for the memories, the laughter, and the many good times shared here,\" the brewery said in the Facebook post.\n\n\"Many of us have developed great friendships with many of you. Please visit and say goodbye. Cheers!\" the message concluded.\n\nEntropy Brewing Co. opened for business on July 3, 2024, in a historic 125-year-old downtown Miamisburg building that was built in 1900 to house Suttman's Men's and Boy's Wear, which itself shut down in 2013, according to the Dayton Daily News.\n\nThe fledgling craft brewery, which described itself as \"a multi-generational brew pub for the whole family,\" included an indoor playground for children 2-10 years old in an adjacent building where the brew pub's kitchen is located.\n\nThe brewery featured a taproom on the main floor and a speakeasy lounge and cocktail bar in the basement. The second and third floors housed one- and two-bedroom apartments.",

    "title": "How CEO Winnie Park is reshaping Five Below into 'Costco for kids'",
    "description": "Five Below's decision to appoint relatively little-known retail executive Winnie Park as CEO last year is looking like a brilliant move.",
    "fullText": "Christmas, it is often said, is a time for second chances.\n\nSo it would seem for Five Below, which is celebrating a transformational year under the leadership of CEO Winnie Park.\n\nThe stock is up about 85% this year so far — that's well more than the returns of most major retail stocks and AI chip darling Nvidia in the same period.\n\nTo rewind, last year's holiday season wasn't looking like a very joyful one for the tween- and teen-focused retailer.\n\nThe Philadelphia-based company was on its way to posting its fourth-straight quarter with negative or flat comparable sales, and that was coming off several prior years of underwhelming performance.\n\nWhile Five Below was managing to grow overall sales through the addition of new stores, existing stores weren't resonating with shoppers. It was also dealing with industry-wide challenges, including shoplifting and the rise of low-priced e-commerce players like Shein and Temu.\n\nWith Five Below's stock languishing around a third of its 2023 peak, the company tapped Park, then-CEO of Forever 21, to take over as CEO in December 2024 during the holiday rush last year.\n\n\"When she came in, she was sort of an unknown quantity,\" Mizuho retail analyst David Bellinger told Business Insider. \"It was a question of how is she going to fix this business immediately.\"\n\nWhile Park may not have been the most widely known CEO on Wall Street, she did come equipped with decades of industry experience, including as CEO of Forever 21 and Paper Source, as well as executive roles at Duty Free Shoppers and Levi's, and a stint with McKinsey's retail team.\n\n\"Her background allows her to really understand how all of these different aspects of the Five Below business work, because she's drawing on a very rich career,\" Global Data retail analyst Neil Saunders told Business Insider.\n\n\"A lot of people come in sometimes as CEOs, and they don't have a tremendous background in retail, or they may have experience in merchandising, but not in supply chains,\" he added. \"Winnie Park was almost like the complete package.\"\n\nFive Below did not respond to a request for comment on this story.\n\nPark wasted no time diving in with cofounder and executive chairman Tom Vellios and chief operating officer Ken Bull.\n\nThe first order of business was refocusing the merchandise on what Five Below's core teen and tween customers want.\n\nBellinger said this was a result of Park's major reset with the sourcing teams, guiding them to find hot items and buy with confidence, while steering away from items, like luggage, that were more adult-focused.\n\n\"They loaded the store up with 'Lilo and Stitch' merchandise, SpongeBob, Hello Kitty — so when you do have these good, well-known brands, it sort of lifts the whole store,\" he said.\n\nThe merchandising effort was also paired with a social media push that the company says has helped attract new shoppers.\n\nPark's other major area of focus was simplifying store operations for both employees and customers.\n\nWith a bit of planning and an incremental investment in labor hours, Five Below says it has improved in-stock rates and customer support at its stores, helping to drive higher sales.\n\n\"Winnie Park is the type of leader that has a very clear vision for the business,\" Saunders said. \"She doesn't really overcomplicate things.\"\n\nIn addition to getting Five Below back to some principles it may have lost touch with in recent years, Park is also showing a willingness to let go of at least one thing that may have been holding the company back: its $5 price point.\n\nThe last few years of inflation haven't made it easy for retailers with dollar-denominated branding to stick to their original promises. Dollar Tree had to hike its base price to $1.25, and it's tough to run a 99 Cents Only store at a time when the US government is eliminating the penny. President Donald Trump's trade war this year hasn't been much help for import-heavy businesses, either.\n\nTo manage these cost pressures, the company lumped more merchandise in a catch-all section of the store called Five Beyond, which it had set up years earlier.\n\nBut that distinction brought unnecessary complexity without meaningful benefit, and the company recently ditched the plan in favor of grouping products by category instead of a price threshold.\n\n\"It was a very disjointed merchandising set,\" Bellinger said. \"Anything in that price threshold was in the back there.\"\n\nNow, he said, \"the way they've assorted the store and spread these items out makes a lot more sense.\"\n\nBellinger said the move shows that Park understands a critical lesson that successful retailers have had to reckon with in the last few years: value and price are not the same thing.\n\n\"You could find value in that $30 item. It's all relative,\" he said.\n\nTaken together — exciting products, well-run stores, a focus on great value — Five Below is starting to look in some ways more like a warehouse club than a discount store.\n\n\"Five Below is essentially the Costco for kids,\" Bellinger said. \"Maybe you want to get some core birthday or party items, and then you wind up expanding your basket and buying all these things you didn't know were there. And then it leads you to your next visit, and you just keep coming back.\"\n\nThe success of the past year will raise the expectations for next year's quarterly comparable sales numbers, but Five Below still has several levers it says it can pull to meet the moment.\n\nBellinger said investors are keen to see whether the recent changes at Five Below have led to a structural shift that will drive long-term performance.\n\nThe average Five Below store generates annual sales of around $2.1 million, but Bellinger said Park's initiatives could significantly boost that number: \"Why can't that be a $3 million store now, or even higher?\"",
