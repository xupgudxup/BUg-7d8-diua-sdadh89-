    "description": "A laid-off Amazon employee used his severance package to launch his comedy career, while working part-time in retail. He says it was worth the risk.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ricci Armani, a 33-year-old comedian based in Seattle. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn late 2022, I remember randomly telling my boyfriend, \"There might be a time when I make less money because I'm going to choose comedy over corporate.\" The next day, I got laid off from my job at Amazon, and I had to be like, \"Well, that time might be sooner than we even talked about.\"\n\nIt was terrifying, but it felt like a huge sign that I was meant to take this path to become a comedian.\n\nI had to take on a part-time retail job to pay the bills, and there are still moments where self-doubt creeps in, but if I ever have to go back to corporate America, or if I don't achieve my dream of being a nationally selling stand-up comic, I can look back and know I gave it my all.\n\nThis journey has been worth the risk.\n\nI first got hired as a contractor at Amazon in 2020 and was then brought on for a full-time role. I later started going to open mics as just a fun thing I loved doing, and gained some popularity in the Seattle area, but it was just a side hustle.\n\nAmazon gave me the opportunity to search for another internal role, but I took the layoff package. I decided I was going to throw myself fully into comedy, using my severance package to propel my career.\n\nI was absolutely terrified, and I didn't know if it was a smart move, especially since everyone had been talking about how bad the job market was. I had been working in a nearly full-time capacity since I was 16, and here I was at 30, not knowing what was next for me.\n\nIt was scary, but it also felt like a burden lifted off my shoulders when I realized I didn't need to return to the corporate rat race. I felt very empowered that I was using this moment to choose my own path.\n\nAt the time of the layoff, I think I had 2,000 followers on Instagram and none on TikTok. For stand-up comics these days, followers are the path to making money, so if I'm being honest, I felt a bit foolish for thinking, \"I'm a full-time comic now.\"\n\nHowever, I felt like if I kept at it and worked hard, something good would come of it. I believed in this path so much, and I was ready to risk everything to make it happen.\n\nI created a posting regimen for social media content, started performing locally as much as possible, and spoke with established comedians to learn from their advice. I'm very lucky that I have some amazing mentors in the comedy world who taught me that it's going to be hard, but encouraged me that I get to be my own boss and experiment.\n\nI quickly found out that performing locally wasn't going to pay the bills, so I got a retail job to supplement my income. My advice would be for other people to get a part-time job that doesn't require them to take work home.\n\nAbout six months after I was laid off, I created my live show, \"My Straight Friends,\" where a straight comedian does standup and then I quiz them on gay culture.\n\nI did a test run at a local venue, and it was so bad. I barely sold any tickets, but there was something about it that just felt right. I kept running with it, and it's what has propelled me to tour across several states.\n\nI don't think I truly started experiencing self-doubt until last year, when I realized there's some scarcity to this career path. I'm at a level where it feels so much harder to break through to the next. My income can be inconsistent, and there have been times when I've lost money putting on a show.\n\nI'm at a point where I've been going back to my roots and seeking mentorship from people who are at the place I want to be. It's so easy to be delusional in the beginning, but there are moments of creeping doubt.\n\nI'm still working on my stand-up show and working my hardest to get into some new national and international comedy festivals this year.\n\nTalk to people and seek mentorship from those who are doing what you want to do. One of the most valuable things I did after my layoff was learn from other people, rather than just fumbling in the dark, trying to figure it out myself.\n\nThe words of encouragement I would've wanted to hear at that time of my layoff are to trust myself and trust the process. I know it's so corny, but there's truth to it. Trust the process and look at what the data from the outside world is telling you. Is it showing you that this is working? If not, pivot and figure out how to make it work. Keep going and don't give up.\n\nDo you have a story to share about being laid off from Amazon? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "Inside Amazon's 'mind-blowing' plan to fix groceries and beat Walmart",
    "description": "Internal documents show Amazon is reshaping its retail infrastructure to compete head-on with Walmart's Supercenter model.",
    "fullText": "For years, Amazon was cast as Walmart's great disruptor. Now, it's borrowing from the retail giant it once sought to upend.\n\nThe company is rolling out Walmart-inspired ideas, including \"Supercenter\" warehouses, a new distribution layer known internally as the \"1DC\" network, and microfulfillment centers within Whole Foods stores, according to internal documents obtained by Business Insider.\n\nThe shift reflects a hard lesson: mastery of e-commerce does not translate into dominance in groceries, particularly perishable items that drive frequent shopping. Walmart's dense network of stores and distribution centers, designed to move everyday goods quickly and cheaply, has proved difficult to replicate.\n\nNearly a decade after paying $13.7 billion for Whole Foods, Amazon still trails Walmart in everyday grocery shopping, and is now reshaping its retail infrastructure to compete head-on with Walmart's Supercenter model.\n\nEarlier this month, plans emerged for a roughly 225,000-square-foot Amazon megastore near Chicago. Bigger than a typical Walmart Supercenter, the new concept is designed to let customers buy \"fresh groceries, household essentials, and general merchandise — all in one trip,\" according to Amazon.\n\nMichael Levin and Josh Lowitz, cofounders of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, called the move \"mind-blowing\" and said \"it reveals a degree of Walmart jealousy that we didn't expect.\"\n\nThere's a lot to be jealous about. With roughly 90% of the US population estimated to live within 10 miles of a Walmart store, the company's 5,000-plus locations give it a powerful edge in selling fresh food and other perishables, along with many other everyday staples.\n\nAccording to research firm Numerator, Walmart accounted for about 21% of the US grocery market, both online and in-store, as of September. Amazon and Whole Foods, meanwhile, each held roughly 1.6% of the market.\n\nMeanwhile, Walmart is leveraging its Supercenters to deliver online orders faster, challenging Amazon at its own game.\n\nThat's fueled a surge in Walmart shares, valuing the company close to $1 trillion. The stock is up almost 150% over 5 years, far outpacing Amazon's roughly 53% gain (although Amazon is still worth more).\n\nAmazon does well with non-perishable goods and everyday essentials such as toothpaste and paper towels. Overall, it offers millions of products for same-day delivery.\n\nBut when it comes to more delicate food items, such as pears, meat, and cheese, the company knows it has more work to do.\n\nA company spokesperson said Amazon serves more than 150 million US grocery customers, offers nearly 3 million grocery and household items, and provides same-day delivery in more than 9,000 cities and towns.\n\nGrocery is an \"ever-growing\" part of its fast-delivery business, the spokesperson added, while noting that in 2025, Amazon added perishable groceries to its Same-Day Delivery service, now available in 2,300 locations, allowing customers to shop without trade-offs between speed, selection, and savings.\n\nOne element of this fresh Amazon effort is a new type of same-day delivery warehouse internally called an \"SSD Supercenter.\" SSD refers to sub-same-day deliveries, typically within four hours. Unlike traditional SSD warehouses that tend to be smaller, these facilities are designed to be larger to close the selection gap, specifically with \"Walmart\" in groceries, the document said.\n\nInternal planning documents show Amazon intended to launch at least five such sites last year. Amazon wanted to test whether customers would \"step-change their shopping habituation and engagement\" once the Supercenter warehouses went live, one of the documents stated. Amazon planned to add products not currently sold on its site to the new warehouse and take a more hands-on approach to inventory sourcing, with in-stock targets above 95%, according to the document.\n\nSub-same-day grocery delivery is still a tiny part of Amazon's business. At the end of September, it had 30 million eligible customers for this service, according to one of the internal documents obtained by Business Insider. Only 1.6 million of them, or roughly 5%, shopped through the service.\n\nAmazon's Supercenter warehouses are part of a broader push to expand same-day grocery delivery. Internal forecasts called for at least 34 US same-day grocery sites in 2025. Amazon already operates over 80 same-day facilities nationwide, though not all handle groceries, according to Marc Wulfraat, president of logistics consultancy MWPVL.\n\nAmazon is also planning to take the model overseas. Under an initiative known as Project Taylor, the company plans to expand sub-same-day grocery delivery across Europe. It also plans to pilot sub-two-hour \"ultrafast\" deliveries in London in 2026, one of the documents showed.\n\nLess visible, but just as important, is a new upstream distribution layer called \"1DC.\"\n\nThese facilities store the most frequently purchased products and replenish fulfillment centers as demand emerges. That can shift weeks' worth of inventory out of space-constrained fulfillment centers and into distribution sites optimized for palletized storage and rapid transfer.\n\nOne internal document described the change as a move from a \"push\" system, in which inventory is positioned based on forecasts, to a \"pull\" system that allows fulfillment centers to draw inventory from distribution centers as needed.\n\nAmazon began rolling out the 1DC concept last year through new buildings and retrofits. By the end of 2025, the company planned to operate a dozen of these centers, capable of moving at least 20 million units a week, according to one of the documents. As of October 2025, the facilities only handled non-perishables, including shelf-stable food items, but not frozen or chilled products, the document stated.\n\nThe 1DC idea emerged after Amazon introduced one-day delivery in 2018, one of the documents stated. Longer delivery windows once allowed the company to rely on a single layer of warehouses that could ship inventory from any fulfillment center to any customer. But faster delivery promises made that model \"untenable,\" forcing Amazon toward a structure long used by traditional retailers, the document added.\n\nMWPVL's Wulfraat said Walmart pioneered the distribution-center model that stores inventory for replenishing retail locations, while Amazon built its business around fulfillment centers that ship directly to consumers. Amazon also operates a cross-dock network to resupply its fulfillment centers, he said, and the 1DC sites represent a newer, more targeted layer of that system focused on high-velocity items.\n\nAmazon's spokesperson told Business Insider that 1DC is part of a broader initiative the company previously announced to regionalize its delivery operations and reduce shipping costs.\n\nPerhaps the clearest signal of Amazon's shift is its rethinking of Whole Foods. Once positioned mainly as a premium grocer, the chain is increasingly treated as logistics infrastructure.\n\nAmazon has begun installing micro-fulfillment centers in the back of select stores, effectively turning them into local hubs for online orders.\n\nOne upgraded Whole Foods site in suburban Philadelphia, announced last year, now fulfills Amazon orders from the back of the store. The model lets shoppers buy Whole Foods-specific items while also ordering products available only on Amazon, reducing the need to shop at other retailers.\n\nAmazon expects this store to serve roughly 100,000 e-commerce units a week by consolidating deliveries from nearby stores, and forecasts online order adoption to grow to 10% by the end of 2026, according to one of the documents.\n\nThis approach also mirrors Walmart's strategy of using its stores to fulfill online orders. Walmart said last year that it can offer same-day delivery to 93% of US households through its store-fulfilled network, with about 35% of those orders arriving within three hours.\n\nThe success of Amazon's new approach depends on one of the hardest problems in logistics: perishables.\n\nInternal plans show Amazon aiming to expand its perishables distribution capacity from 2.6 billion units in 2025 to 3.3 billion units by the end of 2026. The increase would come from new distribution centers and tighter operational standards across the existing network.\n\nThe push is central to Amazon's same-day delivery strategy and its broader grocery ambitions. Company documents stress that delivering high-quality perishables quickly and reliably is essential to scaling the business.\n\nThe goal is expansive. One document calls for making perishables available to \"100% of Prime customers\" as quickly as possible.\n\nHave a tip?

Nicholas previously served as chief financial officer for the international division.\n\nUS chief merchandising officer Latriece Watkins will step into Nicholas's role as head of the warehouse club chain. Watkins started as an intern at Walmart in 1997.\n\n\"These leadership changes also mark a key step in how we organize for the future,\" Furner said in his statement. \"As AI rapidly reshapes retail, we are centralizing our platforms to accelerate shared capabilities, freeing up our operating segments to be more focused on and closer to our customers and members.\"",

    "fullText": "In a lot of retail areas, there seem to be two clear-cut market leaders, and most people have a favorite.\n\nYou might prefer Lowe's over Home Depot, or Sam's Club over Costco.\n\nThe same logic applies to food. Some people are diehard Hostess fans, while others ride or die with Little Debbie.\n\nIn some areas, these choices can be polarizing and divisive. One person might be all in on the Big Mac, while their partner greatly prefers the Whopper.\n\nThe most polarizing battle, however, might be the choice between Coca-Cola and Pepsi.\n\nBoth companies have made public claims to be better than the other, and each one has restaurants and other partners such as theme parks, movie theaters, and arenas under exclusive deals.\n\nWhen a brand switches from Coke to Pepsi or vice versa, it's going to anger some customers, and that's exactly what Costco has done in its food court. The warehouse club has switched back to Coca-Cola products from PepsiCo brands.\n\nBecause Coke and Pepsi both have a large fan base, switching can anger some customers.\n\nI experienced a similar reaction last year aboard Carnival Celebration when the cruise line switched from Pepsi products to Coca-Cola mid-sailing. As inventory ran out, Coke fans hunted for remaining Coke products, while Pepsi drinkers searched for the last Mountain Dew and Pepsi, highlighting how emotionally charged soda loyalty can be.\n\nCostco rolled out the change toward the end of 2025 and finished swapping Pepsi products for Coca-Cola brands in the beginning of 2026.\n\nThat's not something Costco has commented on extensively, but CEO Ron Vachris addressed it during the question-and-answer session of the retailer's annual meeting.\n\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\n\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\n\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\n\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\n\n“Yes, that is accurate,” Vachris said. “This summer, we will begin converting our food court fountain business back over to Coca-Cola.”\n\nCostco had been under an exclusive deal with Pepsi since 2013.\n\n\"Costco originally made the switch to Pepsi in 2013 as a cost-saving measure, in order to keep the price of their famous hot dog and soda combo at $1.50. At the time, Pepsi was offering Walmart a better pricing deal that Costco couldn’t match. When Costco asked Coke for the same pricing, Coke refused, leading Costco to pull all Coke products from their stores for an entire month,\" Costco Insider reported.",

    "description": "The parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and Bergdorf Goodman has struggled to pay vendors.",
    "fullText": "Saks Global has declared bankruptcy.\n\nThe owner of Saks Fifth Avenue and other iconic luxury department stores filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Tuesday in the Southern District of Texas. Each of Saks Global's marquee brands — it also owns Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman — is a luxury retailing giant founded more than a century ago.\n\nThe bankruptcy filing showed that Saks Global owes millions to the biggest names in luxury, including over $136 million to Chanel, $59 million to Gucci's parent company, Kering, and $33 million to Michael Kors' parent company, Capri Holdings.\n\nThe fall of the high-end department store parent — which Business Insider recently detailed in a deep-dive — has been anticipated for months amid signs that its 2024 deal to acquire Neiman Marcus, financed by $2.2 billion in high-interest bonds, has left it struggling financially.\n\nThe $2.7 billion deal, which included investments from Amazon and Salesforce, was intended to strengthen legacy brands by providing them with scale and creating efficiencies. Instead, it left the company burdened by hefty interest payments and unable to pay vendors.\n\nMetrick stepped down as CEO in early January after a roughly three-decade career with the company and was replaced by then-executive chairman Richard Baker.\n\nSome vendors, who told Business Insider they were not paid on the schedule meant to start in July, began shunning the luxury retailer as the holiday season approached.\n\n\"They must do something very quickly to rectify this situation in the market, or they will not have a spring season,\" Gary Wassner, the CEO of Hilldun Corp., which acts as a sort of guarantor or insurer for brands, told Business Insider in late December.\n\nAt the time of the interview, Hilldun, which works with about 140 brands shipping to Saks, had stopped backing shipments to the retailer until payments resumed at the agreed-upon terms.\n\nSaks has recently faced multiple lawsuits from vendors accusing the company of failing to pay for merchandise that was sold and delivered.\n\nOne New York state lawsuit filed in October by Jovani Fashion, a dressmaker that \"Real Housewives of New York\" star Luann de Lesseps helped popularize, alleged that Saks owed it nearly $300,000. Saks' attorneys have denied the allegations in court papers.\n\nThe Tuesday bankruptcy filing showed that Saks Global had between 10,001 and 25,000 creditors. It also had between $1 billion and $10 billion in assets and the same in liabilities.",

    "title": "From humanoid robots to agentic AI, I learned what retail insiders are buzzing about at a major industry conference",
    "description": "AI and innovation — from humanoid robots to agents — dominated the conversation at the National Retail Federation's Big Show 2026.",
    "fullText": "There were two little letters on everyone's lips: AI.\n\nEach year, the National Retail Federation, a leading industry trade group, hosts one of the industry's largest conferences, known as Retail's Big Show. I attended the convention, held in New York City from January 11 to 13, for the first time to hear from industry insiders about the retail trends to watch in 2026.\n\nThis year's event drew speakers such as Walmart's incoming CEO John Furner and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who announced a new AI deal this week, as well as Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin. It was clear that artificial intelligence was the big topic on the minds of the attendees from over 5,000 brands at the event.\n\nWalking the expo hall, \"AI\" and \"agentic\" seemed to be mentioned on nearly every other banner or booth I passed. Onstage, retail leaders touted their AI strategies.\n\nLarge retailers, such as Walmart and Lowe's, have introduced their own AI shopping agents or partnered with AI platforms like Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT; however, these efforts are still in their early stages.\n\nI also saw firsthand how some companies are experimenting with new technologies. There were humanoid robots walking up to greet attendees and digital drive-thru menu boards with bright colors advertising to retailers what their AI-powered menus could look like.\n\nDespite some of the noise surrounding retail's AI-powered direction, CEOs, including Fran Horowitz of Abercrombie & Fitch, said young founders should keep the fundamentals top of mind while embracing innovation. Improving customer service, for instance, remains at the forefront of retailer decision-making.\n\nIn one session, Ralph Lauren's chief branding and innovation officer, David Lauren, talked about his brand's longtime partnership with Microsoft. It led to the creation of Ask Ralph, a chatbot-style customer assistant. The bot is powered by Microsoft's AI, but it is designed to function like a styling assistant that suggests clothing based on prompts, such as an occasion you're attending.\n\nIt's a taste of the future with the personal touch customers may want from a store associate.\n\n\"It's like having Ralph Lauren in your pocket,\" Lauren said at the conference.\n\nCurrently, AI is most useful for bargain-hunting and basic customer service, according to a panel about Gen Z that included members of The Z Suite, a collective of consultants specializing in the consumer space. Chatbots like Ask Ralph can be convenient in a pinch, but the shopping experience doesn't begin and end there, the Gen Z consultants who ranged in age from 17 to 24 said.\n\nYoung people seem to still crave some of the old-school fundamentals that define retail: quality, customer service, and in-store experiences. There's no replicating trying on the perfect dress in person, one young panelist said.\n\nThey said they see AI as a starting point that they can use to find the unique items they covet. They're willing to put in the work to find the right item for them. This includes scouring Reddit for \"real\" reviews that TikTok influencers may not offer, said Olivia Meyer, a buyer who is part of The Z Suite.\n\nAnd although they're not rushing to get on the phone with a customer service representative, the consultants said they want to talk to a human when their money is at stake.\n\nThese Gen Z retail professionals, who also included a global merchant for Calvin Klein and a marketing associate, said they want their clothes to come from authentic brands that are transparent about their use of AI. They pointed to online speculation about AI models in ads, saying Gen Z doesn't care if the brands use AI models; they just want the truth.\n\nThey want to get their money's worth for the clothes that they're buying, which is why data shows this demographic is straying away from fast fashion and toward shopping secondhand on sites like Vinted and eBay.\n\nTrue Religion's chief marketing officer, Kristen D'Arcy, who moderated the panel, said shoppers are craving authenticity in the world of AI-generated content, and it's making them more discerning. To that end, the denim brand has leveraged partnerships that align with its values, such as collaborations with artists like Megan Thee Stallion.\n\nThe three-day event gave me a glimpse into the retail landscape of 2026.\n\nAI may be the loudest trend, but that doesn't mean brands should forget the basics.",

    "title": "The merch wars have come to fast food",
    "description": "Fast food chains are expanding their retail offerings and seeking viral glory with collectable items, like cups, keychains, apparel, and tote bags.",
    "fullText": "Limited-edition cups, tote bags, and cartoonish keychains are the latest weapon in the restaurant industry's battle for consumer attention.\n\nAs restaurant margins remain tight and consumers become more price-sensitive, chains are expanding their retail offerings and increasingly turning to collectible merchandise as a way to signal increased value without resorting to discounting.\n\nThe strategy, experts say, taps into consumers' fear of missing out as well as their sense of identity — especially for younger generations, who see brands as social signals — while driving repeat visits, loyalty sign-ups, and viral buzz. The result is a low-cost, high-impact approach that helps restaurants stay culturally relevant and top of mind even as dining habits shift.\n\nStarbucks' Bearista cups are a recent and widely visible example. Released in limited quantities around the holidays, the cups sparked lines, sellouts, and sky-high resale listings — and, crucially, social-media chatter that had little to do with coffee itself. Ernie Ross, founder of the branding agency Ross Advertising, said the frenzy wasn't accidental.\n\n\"That scarcity of supply, that limited idea that this is only for an exclusive group of a few people, increases the value and worth of any item,\" Ross said. \"Some of the stores received less than 10 of the cups, yet they were promoting that you should come to Starbucks for this.\"\n\nRoss said scarcity reliably shifts consumer behavior, creating urgency and predictable \"queueing\" instincts that brands can harness in moments of pressure.\n\n\"If you tell us that something is scarce in supply, we desire it more,\" he said. It's just human nature, he added — if you see a group lining up for an item, you're going to want to jump in line, too.\n\nThe strategy is accelerating at a fraught moment for restaurants — especially in the middle of the market. Deloitte principal Evert Gruyaert said that restaurants, operating in a value-driven environment, are seeking ways to hold their core consumers' attention.\n\n\"The consumer today is increasingly looking for more value for the price,\" Gruyaert said. \"Now in the US, about 40% of consumers are really what we would call value-seekers.\"\n\nWhile many chains are also bolstering their value menus and slashing combo meal prices, continued discounting is not a viable long-term plan.\n\n\"Heavily discounting your menu is just not sustainable,\" Gruyaert said, noting that restaurants operate on \"very, very thin margins.\"\n\nCollectible merch, he said, offers a workaround.\n\n\"We call these full-margin promotions,\" Gruyaert said. \"You can still charge the full price of your meal, get your full margin on that, but you just get something extra.\"\n\nDunkin's recent mini tote bag promotion followed a similar logic. The chain offered branded totes to loyalty members who purchased a drink, encouraging repeat visits while tying the reward to app usage and data collection. Chick-fil-A has also leaned into collectibles with the launch of branded reusable cups, offering customers a chance at free meals for a year if they snag one of their rare gold designs.\n\n\"Most of this is all to drive additional traffic,\" Gruyaert said. \"It's also driving more frequency — collect them all, and you have a limited amount of time to do that.\"\n\nBeyond traffic, Gruyaert said merchandise is increasingly used to strengthen loyalty ecosystems, adding that exclusive items can replace free food as milestone rewards.\n\nJack in the Box's \"Jibbi\" keychains show how chains are also tapping into internet culture. The vinyl figures, which echo the viral Labubu collectible aesthetic popular among Gen Z, were rolled out as limited-edition items designed to spark social sharing. For branding experts, that cultural resonance is the point.\n\n\"For Gen Z, brands are actually a form of identity and social expression,\" Gruyaert said. \"A restaurant is not just competing on food itself anymore, but also on brand identity.\"\n\nNational Restaurant Association Chief Economist Chad Moutray said consumer demand is already there. He pointed to a recent NRA survey data showing that nearly half of adults are open to buying restaurant-branded apparel.\n\n\"Forty-four percent of adults say they're likely to purchase apparel such as sweatshirts and caps with a restaurant's name and logo,\" Moutray said. Among younger consumers, the numbers are even higher, with 65% of millennials and 55% of Gen Z adults reporting the same appeal.\n\nFor restaurants, Moutray said, merch serves a dual purpose: it's a way for them to extend their brands, while simultaneously operating as free marketing.\n\nThe revenue component of expanded retail offerings matters, too.\n\n\"The math is difficult for restaurants right now,\" Moutray said. \"Costs have risen pretty significantly, and there's a hesitance to pass those on to the consumer.\"\n\nThat makes non-food revenue streams more attractive, allowing chains to extend their brand while also diversifying their revenue.\n\nWhile collectibles aren't new — fast-food toys and promotional giveaways have been staples for decades — experts say the current wave is broader, more intentional, and more culturally attuned. Cross-brand collaborations, like Chipotle's line of college dorm decor with Urban Outfitters, have further amplified the effect.\n\n\"If you have two brands that are tapping into that same consumer segment, that's where the magic can happen,\" Gruyaert said. \"These things are sold out in no time, and they have the potential to go viral.\"\n\nRoss framed the moment as part of a longer shift toward emotional, rather than purely functional, branding.\n\n\"Something only has a value in the meaning attributed to it,\" he said.\n\nHe argued that collectibles work because they create what he calls \"currency of conversation,\" allowing brands to earn attention before talking about menus or pricing.\n\nAnd crucially, all three experts agreed the trend is unlikely to fade once economic conditions improve, with Moutray calling it \"one of those ongoing trends that's going to continue.\"\n\nFor restaurants navigating a squeezed middle, collectible merch has become more than a novelty. It's a way to sell belonging, buzz, and brand loyalty — one tchotchke at a time.",

    "description": "Jackson said that faster chips aren't the big news from Jensen Huang's talk. Instead, the shifting nature of AI infrastructure is the key takeaway.",
    "fullText": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang kicked off the new year by giving investors some key product updates at CES 2026, drumming up fresh bullishness about the chip titan's business.\n\nAt the high-profile industry event, Huang revealed that production has begun on Rubin, its six-chip AI platform and the follow-up to the popular Blackwell architecture.\n\nThe talk generated a lot of buzz about the future of AI demand and Nvidia's business outlook, but hedge fund manager Eric Jackson argues that the most important takeaway from the talk is much bigger than innovations in chip tech.\n\nJackson, who helped spur rallies in several stocks followed by retail traders last year, said that he thinks many investors missed the key takeaway from the event. In his view, the most important thing isn't that faster or more advanced chips are coming; it is that AI is being built as a utility-scale infrastructure designed to operate for decades.\n\n\"Most people watched NVIDIA's CES keynote and heard 'faster chips,''\" he said. \"That wasn't the message. The real takeaway was this: AI factories are now being planned years in advance — at the land, power, and shell level.\"\n\nIn short, he thinks these statements mean that AI is being treated like electricity or telecom networks, a technology that will serve as a fundamental part of everyday life.\n\n\"The CES + JPM conversations made it clear: AI factories are being planned like utilities — not experiments,\" Jackson noted. \"That changes the slope.\"\n\nAs he sees it, the shifting industry landscape is poised to create more efficient AI production, which will lead to more demand for it through new use cases.\n\nThe investor highlighted the Jevons Paradox, an economic adage that argues that when a resource becomes more efficient to use, people consume it more, not less, despite assumptions. Economist William Stanley Jevons first introduced it in the 19th century to illustrate the growing dependence on coal.\n\n\"The market's obsession with 'capex slowing' misses the point,\" Jackson added. \"If inference + agents + long-context workloads are compounding, power becomes monetizable for longer, not shorter.\"\n\nJackson added that recent AI market developments are feeding his bullish thesis on small-cap tech stocks like Hut 8, IREN, and Cipher Mining, as all three stand to benefit from an economy increasingly powered by AI.\n\n\"Most investors still ask: 'Is AI demand peaking?'\" he wrote. \"The better question now is: Who can deliver reliable power and uptime as AI becomes permanent?\"",

    "title": "Unilever's 'underarm sommeliers' sniff out most promising new products",
    "description": "More than 800 research and development staff work to create — and test — personal care products for the consumer goods group",
    "fullText": "It’s not often you are forced to witness someone stroll up to a topless man — hands held high above his head — and take an enormous inhale of his armpit. “A wine sommelier, but of the underarm,” observes Alan Palmer, chief research and development officer of Unilever’s personal care division, as we watch from a few feet away.\n\nWe’re deep in the heart of the consumer goods group’s colossal research and development facility near Liverpool, known as Port Sunlight. It is a maze of laboratories and whacky testing rooms devoted almost entirely to keeping Unilever’s personal care brands — which stretch from Axe (Lynx) and Sure deodorant to Dove soap and the household cleaning product Domestos — ahead of their competitors.\n\nThe so-called underarm sommelier takes a step back to consider her findings before moving on to the next target: a slightly older, scrawnier-looking man who stares ahead nonchalantly as his armpits are assessed in a similar fashion.\n\nShe is, of course, part of a dedicated panel of “odour assessors”, whose responsibility is to test the effectiveness of new roll-on and spray deodorants developed by Unilever. Laugh as you like, but this is day-to-day life at Port Sunlight, where the company’s research and development team is under immense pressure to keep the company’s array of deodorants, shampoo and skincare products one step ahead of rivals such as Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer goods group.\n\nUnilever spent just shy of €1 billion on research and development across all of its divisions in 2024 and employs roughly 840 people in its personal care division’s R&D team alone. Working closely with the University of Liverpool, it conducts more than 48 “odour assessments” each year at Port Sunlight, which is the equivalent of 5,000 underarms being sniffed 60,000 times, according to internal figures.\n\nElsewhere a “hot room” akin to a sauna is used to collect copious amounts of sweat per year for testing. The company invested £80 million last year in building an in-house fragrance facility at Port Sunlight, where perfumers develop the scents that underpin its body sprays and shampoos.\n\nYet the sheer time and personnel devoted to the mission seems to leave out the question of whether the world actually needs “whole-body deodorant” (Unilever’s latest innovation), or Lynx’s “lower-body spray” (yes, for the nether regions).\n\nWhile the consumer group spent €1 billion on R&D in 2024, it splashed out about €9.4 billion on marketing, according to its annual report. The year-on-year increase alone was about the same as its entire R&D spend and, at 15.5 per cent of group turnover, marketing expenditure was at its highest level in more than a decade.\n\nPalmer, a Unilever lifer who is at the forefront of its research efforts, is obsessive as he hosts a tour of the Port Sunlight facility. “I feel like consumer goods is the equivalent of Formula 1. The minute I lose a race, it’s like, ‘Why?’ The minute I lose two races then I start really worrying and I can’t lose a season,” he says.\n\nProcter & Gamble, the Cincinnati, Ohio-based competitor behind the likes of Olay, Pantene and Head and Shoulders, is a particular concern of his and he recalls the threat posed by its acquisition of Nature, the natural deodorant brand, in 2017. “There was nothing particularly in the science, but the aesthetics and sensory were very good. They had outstanding fragrances, very, very disruptive and didactic packaging. Suddenly they came with a stick pack, one that was completely monolithic white and the brand was on its side,” he recalls.\n\nThe pressure on him is understandable given the wider context at Unilever. The €13.6 billion personal care business is central to the future of the company as Fernando Fernandez, its chief executive, presses ahead with a restructuring and cost-cutting drive that involves stepping back from some of its food brands, which have struggled with shoppers switching to own-label products in recent years.\n\nDiscussions are reported to be under way over a sale of the British heritage brands Marmite, Bovril and Colman’s mustard, while the healthy snacks brand Graze was recently sold to the German confectioner Katjes International. Last month Unilever completed the long-awaited demerger of its ice cream division, the Magnum Ice Cream Company, which was spun off and floated on the Amsterdam, London and New York stock exchanges.\n\nFernandez, who took over from Hein Schumacher in March, has outlined a “premiumisation” strategy, which involves tweaking Unilever’s products to improve value and desirability. Yet shares barely moved last year.\n\nOne big challenge is whether Unilever can demonstrate that its new and improved products are worth paying more for. This will be no mean feat given sluggish consumer confidence across key markets in Europe and the United States and continued macroeconomic headwinds. While investment in R&D gives some pricing power, it doesn’t guarantee sales even if billions are poured into marketing.\n\n“It’s not an easy thing to do to consistently year in, year out, deliver that innovation that justifies the pricing,” Chris Beckett, a consumer staples analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said. “Consumers on both sides of the Atlantic and in China, you’d point to, are not in a wonderful place right now.”\n\nThere are other markets at play, with Brazil one of Sure’s largest; however, “a lot of consumers in markets that matter to Unilever don’t think the cost of living crisis has gone away”, Beckett said. “Convincing that consumer that your product is worth spending more of their disposable income on, that is not easy.”\n\nStill, there are some early signs its strategy is working. Unilever reported better than expected sales in the most recent quarter, with a particularly strong showing for Dove soaps and deodorant in North America suggesting a resilience in consumer spending across the pond.\n\nDeodorants have become one of Unilever’s largest and fastest-growing categories with Sure, known outside the UK as Rexona, the top ranking of the “power brands”. Founded in 1908 by the Australian physician Alice Sheffer, it nets more than €2 billion in turnover each year and is sold in more than 100 countries.\n\n“If you look back at the history [of Rexona], what you will see is that it was always about using superior science to create a high-performing product that puts people in control of the problem they’ve got,” Ben Curtis, global brand vice-president of Sure, says.\n\nPort Sunlight’s latest innovation, “whole-body” deodorants, kicked off with the launch of Sure and Lynx’s first collection in the UK in January last year. The thinking behind it is that armpits account for less than 2 per cent of body sweat, meaning the large majority of body odour comes from elsewhere.\n\nCurtis says deodorant has moved on from “one can that sits in the family bathroom and everyone’s sharing it, which is how I grew up, to people having their own personal expertise of products that they’re using across their whole body”.\n\nYet critics continue to question whether demand for some of its more curious innovations is primarily a product of heavily funded ad campaigns, as opposed to a missing need among consumers.\n\nOne of Fernandez’s first decisions when he arrived at Unilever was to shift half of its ad budget towards social media alongside a twentyfold increase in the use of online “influencers” to push products via Instagram, TikTok and other channels.\n\nThe company reckons “whole-body” will make up 10 to 15 per cent of total value in deodorants over the next few years. If that’s true, the question of whether canny marketing is the real driver is unlikely to bother Unilever.",

    "fullText": "Mark Cuban has an idea for how to stop the runaway train that is the $38 trillion national debt, and it has a lot to do with the online pharmacy company he founded in January 2022. On Christmas Eve, the billionaire investor posted on X about his frustrations with the insurance market.\n\nInsurers and providers, according to Cuban, “play on the fear and information asymmetry that exists in healthcare.” He advocated for them to be broken up, so as to “make the markets efficient again.”\n\nWhile Cuban’s proposal focused on $100 fines for insurers that over-bill or deny care, the broader thrust of his argument is dismantling opaque middlemen and forcing transparent pricing—as he does with his Cost Plus Drugs pharmacy—could help tame one of the biggest drivers of America’s fiscal strain.​\n\nAmerica’s national debt surged past $38 trillion in October, adding roughly $1 trillion in just over two months in 2025—twice the pace of typical growth since 2000, according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a leading fiscal watchdog. Annual interest payments are already around $1 trillion and could total as much as $14 trillion over the coming decade, a trajectory the watchdog warns is “no way for a great nation like America to run its finances.” A closer look at health insurance and over-billing doesn’t exactly find fixing the issue would fix the debt or deficit​, but Cuban is right that something is definitely off in this space.\n\nCost Plus Drugs sells medications at their manufacturing cost, plus a flat 15% markup, a small pharmacy fee, and a posted shipping charge. The company cuts out traditional pharmacy benefit managers and negotiates directly with manufacturers, publishing acquisition costs and formulas so customers can see exactly how their prices are built.​\n\nFortune and other outlets have reported Cost Plus Drugs can slash the price of some generics from thousands of dollars a month to double‑digit sums, especially for patients who are uninsured or stuck with high deductibles. Cuban argues if similar transparency and direct‑to‑consumer models were applied across health care—combined with rules like letting cash prices count toward insurance deductibles—the country could strip out layers of waste that burden both families and, ultimately, public budgets.",

A firm release date hasn't been set, but the Ultimate 3E is currently slated for Q2 2026 (April-June).\nIf you're eager to get your hands on 8BitDo's first modular controller, be prepared to spend considerably more than you did on the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 or any other traditional controller from the popular accessory maker.

    "description": "Ryan Edwards was a drummer for an indie band, worked at VISA Europe, and now runs Audoo, a music tech startup. Here's his advice on career pivots.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ryan Edwards, 40, the founder of Audoo, who is based in London. His employment and Audoo's investors have been verified by Business Insider. This piece has been edited for length and clarity\n\nIn my early 20s, I was the drummer of an indie band. We toured festivals and made the UK's Top 10 Independent Singles Chart.\n\nBut I knew our success wouldn't last forever. Eventually, the time would come for me to grow up and find a real job.\n\nSince leaving the band in 2008, my career has been varied. I've worked in retail, at startups, and eventually became a senior leader at Visa Europe. In 2018, I founded Audoo, a startup that aims to help musicians receive royalties, which has investors including Elton John.\n\nMy career pivots have been unexpected and I tend to fall into my line of work, but they have felt natural because my dreams keep changing. While my job titles have changed, one thing hasn't: a belief in getting my head down and doing the hard work. In my experience, nine times out of ten, that's what pays off.\n\nAs a kid, I dreamed of being a footballer — then I got into music. My dad loves Motown and he wanted me to become a saxophonist. I started learning the clarinet and the sax, and then the drums, because I thought it might get me more girls.\n\nI planned to study jazz at music school, but that never happened. Soon after I finished my high-school exams, the band I was the drummer of was signed by an indie label while gigging locally. When I heard the words \"record deal,\" I got goosebumps.\n\nFrom 2006, we were suddenly getting studio time and supporting major acts on tour. Looking back, touring for a year and a half was probably a better life experience than going to university: I became a better musician and learned how to drink.\n\nBand life was fun, but it wasn't always easy. I remember renting budget hotel rooms and flipping a coin to see who would sleep on the floor. Eventually, it became clear that the label would prioritize better-selling and more well-behaved bands.\n\nPanic set in when I left the band. I didn't know what to do with my life, but I knew I needed an income. I got a job as an assistant store manager at a cell phone retailer chain in 2008, where I ended up working for four years in increasingly senior roles.\n\nWorking in retail was an excellent education: you're trading day in, day out. There were similarities to life in the band, where I'd sell T-shirts and stickers after shows. In both lines of work, I managed stock and convinced people to part with their hard-earned cash.\n\nI was made redundant in 2012, and after a stint as a business development manager at an app development business — whose founder I met at a friend's wedding — I was offered a job at Visa Europe as a senior manager in late 2013.\n\nI learned to always be open to exploring new opportunities. You never know where they might take you.\n\nIt was my first job in a corporate environment. Suddenly, I was sitting in a three-piece suit at a quiet desk, worrying it would be stale, but I ended up being given permission to shake things up.\n\nI hadn't planned to leave Visa — the pay was great and I felt comfortable in my job. But in 2016, after three years, I joined a fintech start-up in sales, after two brilliant guys tried to poach me. They knew of me from working on Visa data feeds, and needed contacts in retail.\n\nThe risk of pivoting felt worth it because the idea for the business was amazing.\n\nThen the idea for Audoo hit me. In 2018, I was in a department store in London when one of my band's singles started playing, and my wife joked about the royalties I'd earn. I said they were more likely to buy her a coffee than the designer bag she was eyeing up.\n\nWeeks later, I got my royalty statement. It listed what I'd been paid but offered no data about how those payments were calculated or the flow of how plays become payment. I became fascinated by how the royalties process worked — and realized the system was a mess.\n\nInspired by Amazon's Alexa and Shazam, I wanted to build a technology that would identify the music played in public and ensure artists get paid fairly for it. I built the first prototype for Audoo on my kitchen table with a Raspberry Pi. It worked — it recognized songs —but, looking back, it was embarrassing. We use barely any of that code anymore.\n\nNow, our Audoo Audio Meter uses a plug-in device to track the music played in commercial premises, like stores and bars, and sends the data to royalty-collection organizations.\n\nI incorporated Audoo in August 2018 at the age of 33. We'd just gotten a puppy and my wife was pregnant, so I needed it to work. I used LinkedIn to reach out to industry leaders and set up coffee dates, which quickly confirmed there was demand to build and scale the product.\n\nIn 2020, Björn Ulvaeus of ABBA saw me on TV promoting Audoo and later invested. He put out a statement that exceeded my expectations: \"Audoo is a solution I believe will change the music industry forever,\" he said.\n\nThrough word of mouth, others in the music industry started to hear about the company and invest, including Elton John.\n\nThe team and the mission we're delivering are incredibly rewarding — but I'm always open to new challenges.\n\nWhen I was a drummer in The Lines, I never thought I'd one day be the CEO of a music tech company. I can't say where the future will take me as I've never been one to stick to a particular plan.\n\nWhile some people have lifelong linear goals, I tend to reset mine every two to three years. For me, it's about continually learning something new, never being boxed in, and being adaptable to change.",

    "title": "Walmart salary data revealed: How much the retail giant pays designers, software engineers, and other tech workers",
    "description": "See how much Walmart pays in 2025, with software engineers earning as much as $286,000. Salary data shows pay ranges across tech and analytics teams.",
    "fullText": "Walmart is trying to transform itself from America's grocery store into a global tech titan and is reshaping its workforce in the process.\n\nThe 63-year-old company has been the largest retailer in the world for decades and has held the top spot on the Fortune 500 list since 2013. But it has also invested heavily over the past several years in becoming a powerhouse of e-commerce and retail media.\n\nSalary data shows how serious Walmart is about competing with the likes of Amazon, Facebook, and Google for talent to beef up its tech.\n\nCompany filings with the US Labor Department show Walmart sought to hire more than 4,000 workers through the US H-1B visa program in the most recent reporting year, which ended September 30. Those workers were largely in software development, business intelligence, and IT. That number is up slightly from about 3,800 for the same period a year before.\n\nThis publicly available work visa data — which companies are required to disclose to the government — refers only to foreign hires and doesn't include equity or other benefits that employees can receive in addition to their base pay.\n\nIn addition to base salary, a Walmart spokesperson said that the company's compensation packages include bonus opportunities and stock awards and that the company invests in employees' career growth.\n\nStill, the reported pay rates are benchmarked against industry standards for US workers. That can shed light on how much Walmart employees earn in specific roles and where the company is looking to expand.\n\nAt the same time, the process for obtaining an H-1B visa is changing.\n\nPresident Donald Trump instituted a new $100,000 fee for the visa in September, and other proposed changes to H-1B visa rules would tilt the program in favor of the highest-paid applicants, lawyers told Business Insider.\n\nOther employers, including Amazon, submit work visa data, and Walmart's salaries are largely in line with those for similar roles at the e-commerce giant.\n\nAny changes to the H-1B visa program could have a significant impact on Walmart's workforce strategy.\n\nThe retail giant boasts a global workforce of 2.1 million people, of whom about 1.6 million are in the US, making it the largest private employer in both cases.\n\nMost of the company's open positions as of December were for jobs in Walmart stores and Sam's Club warehouses, while about 650 openings were for technology roles.\n\nThe company has been expanding in tech, hiring in July a new executive vice president of AI acceleration, product, and design who reports directly to the CEO, and recruiting for an EVP of AI platforms.\n\nMost of Walmart's white-collar jobs are based either in its Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters or in one of the company's satellite offices in the Bay Area. According to the H-1B data, about half of the positions are in Bentonville, while a third are in California, and most of the remainder are assigned to sites in Texas, New Jersey, Washington, and Virginia.\n\nHere's a deeper look at some of the roles and their annual base salaries:\n\nQuality engineer III: $64,730 to $117,000\n\nSoftware engineer III: $99,052 to $234,000\n\nSenior software engineer: $100,294 to $234,000\n\nStaff software engineer: $127,292 to $286,000\n\nPrincipal software engineer: $149,607 to $286,000\n\nSenior product manager: $121,000 to $234,000\n\nStaff product manager: $136,500 to $286,000\n\nPrincipal product manager: $166,962 to $286,000\n\nData scientist III: $98,800 to $234,000\n\nSenior data scientist: $124,176 to $234,000\n\nStaff data scientist: $138,333 to $338,000\n\nPrincipal data scientist: $158,642 to $286,000\n\nSenior design researcher: $142,002 to $234,000\n\nSenior UX designer: $111,000 to $234,000\n\nSenior manager, UX design: $183,227 to $286,000\n\nDirector, software engineering: $177,154 to $338,000\n\nDirector, data science: $169,000 to $338,000\n\nDirector, product management: $174,300 to $338,000\n\nSenior director, product management: $208,000 to $416,000\n\nGroup director, product management — international: $254,000 to $481,000",

    "description": "Silver prices rose as high as $84 an ounce as talk of an arbitrage play on China's pure-play silver fund gained traction on social media.",
    "fullText": "It's been a wild few weeks for silver.\n\nThe precious metal was already on a record-breaking run this year, and recently got a further boost from speculative interest among Chinese retail investors.\n\nThe price of the metal climbed to a new all-time high of $84 an ounce on Monday before erasing gains and trading lower.\n\nSilver, which is a key component in data centers and is seen as an under-the-radar AI play, has been piquing the interest of investors all year.\n\nBut speculative buying in China started just a couple of weeks ago, when a string of posts on the social media platform Xiaohongshu outlined how investors could start an arbitrage play on the UBS SDIC Silver Futures Fund, China's pure-play silver fund. (Arbitrage is a strategy that enables a trader to capitalize on the price difference of the same asset across different markets.)\n\nThat strategy evidently gained traction. In the past week, the fund was valued at over a 60% premium compared to the value of its assets, and at one point, was up 187% from levels at the start of the year, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nThis spike in Chinese interest can be seen in the spread between spot silver prices in Shanghai and in London, which briefly rose to more than $8 an ounce on Monday, the largest premium the metal has ever posted in China, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nOn Friday, UBS SDIC said it would shutter subscriptions to the fund's Class C shares, which are preferred among short-term traders.

It eventually revealed that it would close all of its stores, numbering about 815.\n\nJoann's demise affected crafts suppliers, including IG Design Group Americas Inc., which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 3, 2025, seeking going-concern sales of its business divisions and a wind-down of its operations.\n\nJoann’s decision to shut down all operations severely impacted IG Design Group’s business, making it difficult for the company to maintain historical operating results and adapt to market conditions despite turnaround initiatives.\n\nEconomic challenges are also affecting another longtime arts and crafts retailer.\n\n40-year-old arts and crafts supply retail chain Artist & Craftsman Supply has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy to reorganize, facing economic headwinds and tight lending restrictions, which severely strained the company's finances, according to Bondoro.\n\nThe 18-store, Portland, Maine-based chain's parent Artstock listed $10 million to $50 million in assets and liabilities in its petition, filed on Dec. 21, BankruptcyObserver reported.\n\nThe debtor owes Cambridge Savings Bank about $1.5 million on a $4 million revolving line of credit, Bondoro reported. It also owes the Small Business Administration about $1.9 million in debt on an SBA loan and about $65,000 in claims on credit card processing sales.\n\nArtist & Craftsman Supply, which was established in 1985, was founded as a small art supply store when the arts and crafts retail industry was dominated by the independent \"mom and pop\" storefronts that sold a combination of arts, crafts, stationery, hardware, and office supplies, according to its website.\n\nCatalog sales were a top competitor in the beginning, as internet-based companies and e-commerce were still about 10 years away from getting started.",

    "fullText": "2025 may go down as the end of an era in retail.\n\nThis was the year that the longtime CEOs at two of the largest chains decided to hand the reins over to their corporate proteges.\n\nThe retirements of Walmart's Doug McMillon and Target's Brian Cornell come as the industry is facing an array of new (and long-term) challenges in the form of a global trade rebalancing, accelerated adoption of AI, and increasingly stretched US household budgets.\n\nFresh legs might be a welcome addition in this race.\n\nDozens of smaller retailers have taken the opportunity to shake up the C-suite as well.\n\nAnalysis from leadership consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that 43 retail companies announced CEO exits in the first 10 months of this year, up from 32 in the same period last year. A few more announcements have come through since.\n\nHere are some of the major retail chains that are getting a new CEO in the new year.\n\nWalmart said in November that the company's US division CEO, John Furner, would become president and CEO on February 1.\n\nLike outgoing CEO Doug McMillon, Furner has been with Walmart for decades, starting as an hourly associate and working his way up through the ranks.\n\nTarget said in August that chief operating officer Michael Fiddelke would succeed Brian Cornell on February 1, with Cornell remaining on the board as Executive Chair.\n\nFiddelke has been with the company for 20 years, starting as a finance intern and moving through roles in merchandising, finance, operations, and human resources.\n\nRV dealer Camping World said in December that founder Marcus Lemonis would step down as CEO on January 1, with company president Matthew Wagner taking over.\n\nWagner has been with Camping World since 2007, serving in numerous leadership roles before being appointed chief operating officer in 2023 and president in 2024.\n\nKraft Heinz said in December that it has snagged Kellanova CEO Steve Cahillane to take over from Carlos Abrams-Rivera on January 1.\n\nThe company will later split into two publicly traded companies, North American Grocery Co. and Global Taste Elevation Co., with Cahillane remaining in charge of the latter.\n\nCahillane has a long career leading consumer products companies like The Nature's Bounty Co. and Coca-Cola's Americas division. He also spent eight years with AB InBev.\n\nIn fairness, Michael Bender's transition effectively happened back in May, but Kohl's made it official in late November when the retailer said Bender would go from interim CEO to a permanent appointment.\n\nThat means Kohl's will start the new year with one less distraction under the leadership of a highly experienced retail executive who has already had a positive impact on the company.\n\nAthleisure brand Lululemon said in December that it was parting ways with CEO Calvin McDonald on January 31, but hasn't yet identified a permanent successor.\n\nIn the meantime, the company said board chair Marti Morfitt would expand her role to become executive chair, and that CFO Meghan Frank, chief commercial officer André Maestrini would serve as interim co-CEOs following McDonald's departure.\n\nParent company Seven & i Holdings said in December that CEO Joe DePinto would retire at the end of the year. The company's current president, Stan Reynolds, and chief operating officer, Doug Rosencrans, are set to serve as co-CEOs until a permanent successor is hired.",

Major chains, from department store Macy's to grocery chain Kroger, have already announced multiyear closure plans that extend into 2026, as have some niche stores.\n\nMany companies, such as Macy's, are closing their physical stores to invest more resources into their online businesses.\n\nIn 2025, Business Insider tracked around 4,100 closures as of late December. Retail data and consultant firm Coresight Research predicted earlier in the year that roughly 15,000 retail locations would close in the year.\n\nSo far for 2026, Business Insider has identified roughly 270 planned closures.\n\nSee the list of major closures below.\n\nCarter's, one of North America's biggest children's and baby apparel retailers, said in October that it plans to close 150 stores across the region over the next three years as leases expire, including about 100 by the end of 2026.\n\nIn January 2025, Macy's said it planned to close 150 locations through 2026, allowing it to focus on its best-performing locations and online experience. After the closures are complete, there will be about 350 Macy's stores left. Macy's closed at least 66 stores in 2025.\n\nGrocery giant Kroger said in June 2025 that it planned to close 60 \"unprofitable\" stores across the US over the next 18 months. The company said in September that it had begun that process.\n\nThe company said in its last annual report that it operated 2,731 supermarkets in 35 states and Washington, DC, as of February 2025.\n\nNewell Brands said in December 2025 that it would close 20 Yankee Candle stores in the US and Canada beginning in January 2026. The closures were announced alongside the reduction of its workforce by over 900 employees.\n\n\"This productivity plan is about taking the next, disciplined step to enhance efficiency, sharpen our strategic focus, and deliver stronger, more consistent performance,\" CEO Chris Peterson said in a press release.\n\nSaks Off 5th, a luxury outlet retailer offering discounted designer brands, told Business Insider that it plans to close select stores in early 2026. The closures include stores in nine locations.\n\n\"We are confident this will better position the Saks Off 5th business for long-term success and look forward to continuing to deliver for our customers,\" a spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\nREI confirmed to Business Insider that it plans to close three stores, starting with a location in New Jersey, in the first quarter of 2026. Its stores in New York City's SoHo neighborhood and Boston are set to follow in late 2026.\n\n\"As markets and customer needs evolve, we must adapt to position the co-op for long-term success,\" the company said in a statement.",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nFor bargain hunters, Costco has long been a go-to destination. The warehouse giant famously still sells its hot dog and soda combo for $1.50 — the same price it launched with back in the mid-1980s. But not every Costco item has held its price as stubbornly as the hot dog combo.\n\nIn late 2023, Costco began selling 1-ounce gold bars. At the time, shoppers could choose between two types: the PAMP Suisse Lady Fortuna Veriscan bar and the Rand Refinery bar, priced at $1,979.99 and $1,949.99, respectively, according to Business Insider. Despite the hefty price tag, both quickly became hot sellers (1).\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nFast forward to today, and not much has changed — except the price.\n\nAs of December 2025, the Pamp Suisse bar sells for $4,119.99, an increase of 108% (2).\n\nThe jump in price is in line with the broader gold market, which has surged roughly 65% over the course of 2025. What’s more surprising is the continued demand.\n\nCustomers are now restricted to “one transaction per membership, with a maximum of 4 units per 24 hours”, according to the Costco website (3).\n\nGold has long been viewed as a way to preserve purchasing power. Unlike fiat currencies, it can’t be printed at will by central banks.\n\nIt’s also considered a classic safe haven. Gold isn’t tied to any one country, currency or economy, and in times of economic turmoil or geopolitical uncertainty, investors often flock to it — driving prices higher.\n\nThat’s exactly what appears to be happening now. Markets are getting whipsawed by tariff uncertainty, rising deficits and global tensions — and gold has emerged as a rare bright spot.\n\nRay Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, also highlighted gold’s importance as part of a resilient portfolio.\n\n“People don't have, typically, an adequate amount of gold in their portfolio,” he told CNBC. “When bad times come, gold is a very effective diversifier (4).”\n\nGold hit a peak price of $4,371.78 per ounce in October, and many experts expect it to continue to rise as stock market outlooks get shaky (5).",

    "fullText": "Managing a business is challenging, even in the best circumstances. In today's uncertain economy, marked by slowing consumer spending and shifting retail habits, it becomes even tougher.\n\nFor one retail chain, the difficulty has been compounded by years of financial strain, two Chapter 11 bankruptcies, and hundreds of store closures nationwide.\n\nOnce an iconic mall staple known for its affordable jewelry, colorful hair accessories, and quirky novelties, Claire's is again facing serious financial setbacks. A new revelation has raised doubts about the long-term survival of the 64-year-old brand, which once played a significant role in the lives of countless teens and tweens.\n\nAs it works to emerge from its second bankruptcy under new ownership by the private equity firm Ames Watson, Claire's is confronting additional pressures from its supply chain. Several Asian suppliers allege they are owed millions of dollars in unpaid debts, according to claims filed in Hong Kong and reported by CNBC.\n\nThe disputed orders were for holiday merchandise placed before Claire's second bankruptcy filing, when Elliott Management still owned the company. Suppliers were reportedly aware of the retailer's financial instability at the time the orders were made. However, by the time production was completed, Claire's had already filed for bankruptcy.\n\nAfter Ames Watson acquired the brand, some suppliers claimed they were still owed payment, but agreed to continue doing business with Claire's. Others chose to pursue legal action against Claire's Hong Kong-based sourcing office, RSI International.\n\nAs a major American retail chain, Claire's is a prominent customer for many of these Asian suppliers. This is why, despite outstanding balances, several vendors continued to fulfill orders out of fear that refusing to do so could jeopardize their business relationship with the retailer.\n\nDuring its latest acquisition process, RSI International notified creditors that they had 30 days to file claims to recover unpaid debts, liabilities that under Hong Kong Law do not transfer to new owners.\n\nIn a statement to CNBC, Ames Watson emphasized it was \"not involved in the operation or purchasing decisions made prior to the acquisition.\"\n\n\"Since then, we have focused on responsibly stewarding the business and engaging suppliers in good faith as we strengthen Claire's for the long term,\" said Ames Watson. \"We are excited about the company’s direction in 2026.\"\n\nClaire's first filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2018, emerging later that year under the new ownership of Elliott Management Corp. and Monarch Alternative Capital.",

    "fullText": "The craft beer industry has suffered a devastating year in 2025, as over 250 breweries in the U.S. closed down permanently in the first six months of the year.\n\nMost craft breweries blamed rising costs, slowing taproom traffic, and fierce retail competition as the reasons for their demise, American Craft Beer reported.\n\nThe number of craft breweries operating in the U.S. declined from 9,747 in 2023 to 9,269 in June 2025, the Brewers Association reported, and the number continues to decline.\n\nSeveral craft brewers have liquidated and closed in Chapter 7 this year, including St. Petersburg, Fla.-based brewery Dissent Craft Brewing, which filed for liquidation in August; Exton, Pa.-based Iron Hill Brewery LLC and San Jose, Calif.-based Strike Brewing Company, which both filed petitions in October; and Oregon-based Rogue Ales & Spirits, which filed Chapter 7 in November.\n\nOne of the most prominent craft brewery closings was Albuquerque, N.M.-based Bosque Brewing Company, which filed for Chapter 11 protection in October 2025 and closed two of its 11 New Mexico establishments in December.\n\nAnd now, popular Ohio beer brand and brewery Entropy Brewing Company posted on social media that it will not make it to New Year's Eve as it closes down its business permanently on Dec. 27, 2025.\n\nThe Miamisburg, Ohio, craft brewery, restaurant, and bar revealed in a Dec. 12 Facebook post that it will shut down operations on Dec. 27, but did not state a reason for closing.\n\n\"We have an important update to share: Entropy Brewing Co. will be closing on December 27, 2025. We are deeply grateful for the incredible support this community has shown us. Thank you for the memories, the laughter, and the many good times shared here,\" the brewery said in the Facebook post.\n\n\"Many of us have developed great friendships with many of you. Please visit and say goodbye. Cheers!\" the message concluded.\n\nEntropy Brewing Co. opened for business on July 3, 2024, in a historic 125-year-old downtown Miamisburg building that was built in 1900 to house Suttman's Men's and Boy's Wear, which itself shut down in 2013, according to the Dayton Daily News.\n\nThe fledgling craft brewery, which described itself as \"a multi-generational brew pub for the whole family,\" included an indoor playground for children 2-10 years old in an adjacent building where the brew pub's kitchen is located.\n\nThe brewery featured a taproom on the main floor and a speakeasy lounge and cocktail bar in the basement. The second and third floors housed one- and two-bedroom apartments.",

    "title": "How CEO Winnie Park is reshaping Five Below into 'Costco for kids'",
    "description": "Five Below's decision to appoint relatively little-known retail executive Winnie Park as CEO last year is looking like a brilliant move.",
    "fullText": "Christmas, it is often said, is a time for second chances.\n\nSo it would seem for Five Below, which is celebrating a transformational year under the leadership of CEO Winnie Park.\n\nThe stock is up about 85% this year so far — that's well more than the returns of most major retail stocks and AI chip darling Nvidia in the same period.\n\nTo rewind, last year's holiday season wasn't looking like a very joyful one for the tween- and teen-focused retailer.\n\nThe Philadelphia-based company was on its way to posting its fourth-straight quarter with negative or flat comparable sales, and that was coming off several prior years of underwhelming performance.\n\nWhile Five Below was managing to grow overall sales through the addition of new stores, existing stores weren't resonating with shoppers. It was also dealing with industry-wide challenges, including shoplifting and the rise of low-priced e-commerce players like Shein and Temu.\n\nWith Five Below's stock languishing around a third of its 2023 peak, the company tapped Park, then-CEO of Forever 21, to take over as CEO in December 2024 during the holiday rush last year.\n\n\"When she came in, she was sort of an unknown quantity,\" Mizuho retail analyst David Bellinger told Business Insider. \"It was a question of how is she going to fix this business immediately.\"\n\nWhile Park may not have been the most widely known CEO on Wall Street, she did come equipped with decades of industry experience, including as CEO of Forever 21 and Paper Source, as well as executive roles at Duty Free Shoppers and Levi's, and a stint with McKinsey's retail team.\n\n\"Her background allows her to really understand how all of these different aspects of the Five Below business work, because she's drawing on a very rich career,\" Global Data retail analyst Neil Saunders told Business Insider.\n\n\"A lot of people come in sometimes as CEOs, and they don't have a tremendous background in retail, or they may have experience in merchandising, but not in supply chains,\" he added. \"Winnie Park was almost like the complete package.\"\n\nFive Below did not respond to a request for comment on this story.\n\nPark wasted no time diving in with cofounder and executive chairman Tom Vellios and chief operating officer Ken Bull.\n\nThe first order of business was refocusing the merchandise on what Five Below's core teen and tween customers want.\n\nBellinger said this was a result of Park's major reset with the sourcing teams, guiding them to find hot items and buy with confidence, while steering away from items, like luggage, that were more adult-focused.\n\n\"They loaded the store up with 'Lilo and Stitch' merchandise, SpongeBob, Hello Kitty — so when you do have these good, well-known brands, it sort of lifts the whole store,\" he said.\n\nThe merchandising effort was also paired with a social media push that the company says has helped attract new shoppers.\n\nPark's other major area of focus was simplifying store operations for both employees and customers.\n\nWith a bit of planning and an incremental investment in labor hours, Five Below says it has improved in-stock rates and customer support at its stores, helping to drive higher sales.\n\n\"Winnie Park is the type of leader that has a very clear vision for the business,\" Saunders said. \"She doesn't really overcomplicate things.\"\n\nIn addition to getting Five Below back to some principles it may have lost touch with in recent years, Park is also showing a willingness to let go of at least one thing that may have been holding the company back: its $5 price point.\n\nThe last few years of inflation haven't made it easy for retailers with dollar-denominated branding to stick to their original promises. Dollar Tree had to hike its base price to $1.25, and it's tough to run a 99 Cents Only store at a time when the US government is eliminating the penny. President Donald Trump's trade war this year hasn't been much help for import-heavy businesses, either.\n\nTo manage these cost pressures, the company lumped more merchandise in a catch-all section of the store called Five Beyond, which it had set up years earlier.\n\nBut that distinction brought unnecessary complexity without meaningful benefit, and the company recently ditched the plan in favor of grouping products by category instead of a price threshold.\n\n\"It was a very disjointed merchandising set,\" Bellinger said. \"Anything in that price threshold was in the back there.\"\n\nNow, he said, \"the way they've assorted the store and spread these items out makes a lot more sense.\"\n\nBellinger said the move shows that Park understands a critical lesson that successful retailers have had to reckon with in the last few years: value and price are not the same thing.\n\n\"You could find value in that $30 item. It's all relative,\" he said.\n\nTaken together — exciting products, well-run stores, a focus on great value — Five Below is starting to look in some ways more like a warehouse club than a discount store.\n\n\"Five Below is essentially the Costco for kids,\" Bellinger said. \"Maybe you want to get some core birthday or party items, and then you wind up expanding your basket and buying all these things you didn't know were there. And then it leads you to your next visit, and you just keep coming back.\"\n\nThe success of the past year will raise the expectations for next year's quarterly comparable sales numbers, but Five Below still has several levers it says it can pull to meet the moment.\n\nBellinger said investors are keen to see whether the recent changes at Five Below have led to a structural shift that will drive long-term performance.\n\nThe average Five Below store generates annual sales of around $2.1 million, but Bellinger said Park's initiatives could significantly boost that number: \"Why can't that be a $3 million store now, or even higher?\"",
