    "description": "CEO turnover was high in the retail sector in 2025. Here are some of the large chains that are getting new leaders.",
    "fullText": "2025 may go down as the end of an era in retail.\n\nThis was the year that the longtime CEOs at two of the largest chains decided to hand the reins over to their corporate proteges.\n\nThe retirements of Walmart's Doug McMillon and Target's Brian Cornell come as the industry is facing an array of new (and long-term) challenges in the form of a global trade rebalancing, accelerated adoption of AI, and increasingly stretched US household budgets.\n\nFresh legs might be a welcome addition in this race.\n\nDozens of smaller retailers have taken the opportunity to shake up the C-suite as well.\n\nAnalysis from leadership consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that 43 retail companies announced CEO exits in the first 10 months of this year, up from 32 in the same period last year. A few more announcements have come through since.\n\nHere are some of the major retail chains that are getting a new CEO in the new year.\n\nWalmart said in November that the company's US division CEO, John Furner, would become president and CEO on February 1.\n\nLike outgoing CEO Doug McMillon, Furner has been with Walmart for decades, starting as an hourly associate and working his way up through the ranks.\n\nTarget said in August that chief operating officer Michael Fiddelke would succeed Brian Cornell on February 1, with Cornell remaining on the board as Executive Chair.\n\nFiddelke has been with the company for 20 years, starting as a finance intern and moving through roles in merchandising, finance, operations, and human resources.\n\nRV dealer Camping World said in December that founder Marcus Lemonis would step down as CEO on January 1, with company president Matthew Wagner taking over.\n\nWagner has been with Camping World since 2007, serving in numerous leadership roles before being appointed chief operating officer in 2023 and president in 2024.\n\nKraft Heinz said in December that it has snagged Kellanova CEO Steve Cahillane to take over from Carlos Abrams-Rivera on January 1.\n\nThe company will later split into two publicly traded companies, North American Grocery Co. and Global Taste Elevation Co., with Cahillane remaining in charge of the latter.\n\nCahillane has a long career leading consumer products companies like The Nature's Bounty Co. and Coca-Cola's Americas division. He also spent eight years with AB InBev.\n\nIn fairness, Michael Bender's transition effectively happened back in May, but Kohl's made it official in late November when the retailer said Bender would go from interim CEO to a permanent appointment.\n\nThat means Kohl's will start the new year with one less distraction under the leadership of a highly experienced retail executive who has already had a positive impact on the company.\n\nAthleisure brand Lululemon said in December that it was parting ways with CEO Calvin McDonald on January 31, but hasn't yet identified a permanent successor.\n\nIn the meantime, the company said board chair Marti Morfitt would expand her role to become executive chair, and that CFO Meghan Frank, chief commercial officer André Maestrini would serve as interim co-CEOs following McDonald's departure.\n\nParent company Seven & i Holdings said in December that CEO Joe DePinto would retire at the end of the year. The company's current president, Stan Reynolds, and chief operating officer, Doug Rosencrans, are set to serve as co-CEOs until a permanent successor is hired.",

    "fullText": "Retailers are gearing up for another wave of store closures.\n\nIt's shaping up to be the continuation of a retail pullback that Business Insider tracked in 2024 and 2025. Major chains, from department store Macy's to grocery chain Kroger, have already announced multiyear closure plans that extend into 2026, as have some niche stores.\n\nMany companies, such as Macy's, are closing their physical stores to invest more resources into their online businesses.\n\nIn 2025, Business Insider tracked around 4,100 closures as of late December. Retail data and consultant firm Coresight Research predicted earlier in the year that roughly 15,000 retail locations would close in the year.\n\nSo far for 2026, Business Insider has identified roughly 270 planned closures.\n\nSee the list of major closures below.\n\nCarter's, one of North America's biggest children's and baby apparel retailers, said in October that it plans to close 150 stores across the region over the next three years as leases expire, including about 100 by the end of 2026.\n\nIn January 2025, Macy's said it planned to close 150 locations through 2026, allowing it to focus on its best-performing locations and online experience. After the closures are complete, there will be about 350 Macy's stores left. Macy's closed at least 66 stores in 2025.\n\nGrocery giant Kroger said in June 2025 that it planned to close 60 \"unprofitable\" stores across the US over the next 18 months. The company said in September that it had begun that process.\n\nThe company said in its last annual report that it operated 2,731 supermarkets in 35 states and Washington, DC, as of February 2025.\n\nNewell Brands said in December 2025 that it would close 20 Yankee Candle stores in the US and Canada beginning in January 2026. The closures were announced alongside the reduction of its workforce by over 900 employees.\n\n\"This productivity plan is about taking the next, disciplined step to enhance efficiency, sharpen our strategic focus, and deliver stronger, more consistent performance,\" CEO Chris Peterson said in a press release.\n\nSaks Off 5th, a luxury outlet retailer offering discounted designer brands, told Business Insider that it plans to close select stores in early 2026. The closures include stores in nine locations.\n\n\"We are confident this will better position the Saks Off 5th business for long-term success and look forward to continuing to deliver for our customers,\" a spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\nREI confirmed to Business Insider that it plans to close three stores, starting with a location in New Jersey, in the first quarter of 2026. Its stores in New York City's SoHo neighborhood and Boston are set to follow in late 2026.\n\n\"As markets and customer needs evolve, we must adapt to position the co-op for long-term success,\" the company said in a statement.",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nFor bargain hunters, Costco has long been a go-to destination. The warehouse giant famously still sells its hot dog and soda combo for $1.50 — the same price it launched with back in the mid-1980s. But not every Costco item has held its price as stubbornly as the hot dog combo.\n\nIn late 2023, Costco began selling 1-ounce gold bars. At the time, shoppers could choose between two types: the PAMP Suisse Lady Fortuna Veriscan bar and the Rand Refinery bar, priced at $1,979.99 and $1,949.99, respectively, according to Business Insider. Despite the hefty price tag, both quickly became hot sellers (1).\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nFast forward to today, and not much has changed — except the price.\n\nAs of December 2025, the Pamp Suisse bar sells for $4,119.99, an increase of 108% (2).\n\nThe jump in price is in line with the broader gold market, which has surged roughly 65% over the course of 2025. What’s more surprising is the continued demand.\n\nCustomers are now restricted to “one transaction per membership, with a maximum of 4 units per 24 hours”, according to the Costco website (3).\n\nGold has long been viewed as a way to preserve purchasing power. Unlike fiat currencies, it can’t be printed at will by central banks.\n\nIt’s also considered a classic safe haven. Gold isn’t tied to any one country, currency or economy, and in times of economic turmoil or geopolitical uncertainty, investors often flock to it — driving prices higher.\n\nThat’s exactly what appears to be happening now. Markets are getting whipsawed by tariff uncertainty, rising deficits and global tensions — and gold has emerged as a rare bright spot.\n\nRay Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, also highlighted gold’s importance as part of a resilient portfolio.\n\n“People don't have, typically, an adequate amount of gold in their portfolio,” he told CNBC. “When bad times come, gold is a very effective diversifier (4).”\n\nGold hit a peak price of $4,371.78 per ounce in October, and many experts expect it to continue to rise as stock market outlooks get shaky (5).",

    "fullText": "Managing a business is challenging, even in the best circumstances. In today's uncertain economy, marked by slowing consumer spending and shifting retail habits, it becomes even tougher.\n\nFor one retail chain, the difficulty has been compounded by years of financial strain, two Chapter 11 bankruptcies, and hundreds of store closures nationwide.\n\nOnce an iconic mall staple known for its affordable jewelry, colorful hair accessories, and quirky novelties, Claire's is again facing serious financial setbacks. A new revelation has raised doubts about the long-term survival of the 64-year-old brand, which once played a significant role in the lives of countless teens and tweens.\n\nAs it works to emerge from its second bankruptcy under new ownership by the private equity firm Ames Watson, Claire's is confronting additional pressures from its supply chain. Several Asian suppliers allege they are owed millions of dollars in unpaid debts, according to claims filed in Hong Kong and reported by CNBC.\n\nThe disputed orders were for holiday merchandise placed before Claire's second bankruptcy filing, when Elliott Management still owned the company. Suppliers were reportedly aware of the retailer's financial instability at the time the orders were made. However, by the time production was completed, Claire's had already filed for bankruptcy.\n\nAfter Ames Watson acquired the brand, some suppliers claimed they were still owed payment, but agreed to continue doing business with Claire's. Others chose to pursue legal action against Claire's Hong Kong-based sourcing office, RSI International.\n\nAs a major American retail chain, Claire's is a prominent customer for many of these Asian suppliers. This is why, despite outstanding balances, several vendors continued to fulfill orders out of fear that refusing to do so could jeopardize their business relationship with the retailer.\n\nDuring its latest acquisition process, RSI International notified creditors that they had 30 days to file claims to recover unpaid debts, liabilities that under Hong Kong Law do not transfer to new owners.\n\nIn a statement to CNBC, Ames Watson emphasized it was \"not involved in the operation or purchasing decisions made prior to the acquisition.\"\n\n\"Since then, we have focused on responsibly stewarding the business and engaging suppliers in good faith as we strengthen Claire's for the long term,\" said Ames Watson. \"We are excited about the company’s direction in 2026.\"\n\nClaire's first filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2018, emerging later that year under the new ownership of Elliott Management Corp. and Monarch Alternative Capital.",

    "description": "Five Below's decision to appoint relatively little-known retail executive Winnie Park as CEO last year is looking like a brilliant move.",
    "fullText": "Christmas, it is often said, is a time for second chances.\n\nSo it would seem for Five Below, which is celebrating a transformational year under the leadership of CEO Winnie Park.\n\nThe stock is up about 85% this year so far — that's well more than the returns of most major retail stocks and AI chip darling Nvidia in the same period.\n\nTo rewind, last year's holiday season wasn't looking like a very joyful one for the tween- and teen-focused retailer.\n\nThe Philadelphia-based company was on its way to posting its fourth-straight quarter with negative or flat comparable sales, and that was coming off several prior years of underwhelming performance.\n\nWhile Five Below was managing to grow overall sales through the addition of new stores, existing stores weren't resonating with shoppers. It was also dealing with industry-wide challenges, including shoplifting and the rise of low-priced e-commerce players like Shein and Temu.\n\nWith Five Below's stock languishing around a third of its 2023 peak, the company tapped Park, then-CEO of Forever 21, to take over as CEO in December 2024 during the holiday rush last year.\n\n\"When she came in, she was sort of an unknown quantity,\" Mizuho retail analyst David Bellinger told Business Insider. \"It was a question of how is she going to fix this business immediately.\"\n\nWhile Park may not have been the most widely known CEO on Wall Street, she did come equipped with decades of industry experience, including as CEO of Forever 21 and Paper Source, as well as executive roles at Duty Free Shoppers and Levi's, and a stint with McKinsey's retail team.\n\n\"Her background allows her to really understand how all of these different aspects of the Five Below business work, because she's drawing on a very rich career,\" Global Data retail analyst Neil Saunders told Business Insider.\n\n\"A lot of people come in sometimes as CEOs, and they don't have a tremendous background in retail, or they may have experience in merchandising, but not in supply chains,\" he added. \"Winnie Park was almost like the complete package.\"\n\nFive Below did not respond to a request for comment on this story.\n\nPark wasted no time diving in with cofounder and executive chairman Tom Vellios and chief operating officer Ken Bull.\n\nThe first order of business was refocusing the merchandise on what Five Below's core teen and tween customers want.\n\nBellinger said this was a result of Park's major reset with the sourcing teams, guiding them to find hot items and buy with confidence, while steering away from items, like luggage, that were more adult-focused.\n\n\"They loaded the store up with 'Lilo and Stitch' merchandise, SpongeBob, Hello Kitty — so when you do have these good, well-known brands, it sort of lifts the whole store,\" he said.\n\nThe merchandising effort was also paired with a social media push that the company says has helped attract new shoppers.\n\nPark's other major area of focus was simplifying store operations for both employees and customers.\n\nWith a bit of planning and an incremental investment in labor hours, Five Below says it has improved in-stock rates and customer support at its stores, helping to drive higher sales.\n\n\"Winnie Park is the type of leader that has a very clear vision for the business,\" Saunders said. \"She doesn't really overcomplicate things.\"\n\nIn addition to getting Five Below back to some principles it may have lost touch with in recent years, Park is also showing a willingness to let go of at least one thing that may have been holding the company back: its $5 price point.\n\nThe last few years of inflation haven't made it easy for retailers with dollar-denominated branding to stick to their original promises. Dollar Tree had to hike its base price to $1.25, and it's tough to run a 99 Cents Only store at a time when the US government is eliminating the penny. President Donald Trump's trade war this year hasn't been much help for import-heavy businesses, either.\n\nTo manage these cost pressures, the company lumped more merchandise in a catch-all section of the store called Five Beyond, which it had set up years earlier.\n\nBut that distinction brought unnecessary complexity without meaningful benefit, and the company recently ditched the plan in favor of grouping products by category instead of a price threshold.\n\n\"It was a very disjointed merchandising set,\" Bellinger said. \"Anything in that price threshold was in the back there.\"\n\nNow, he said, \"the way they've assorted the store and spread these items out makes a lot more sense.\"\n\nBellinger said the move shows that Park understands a critical lesson that successful retailers have had to reckon with in the last few years: value and price are not the same thing.\n\n\"You could find value in that $30 item. It's all relative,\" he said.\n\nTaken together — exciting products, well-run stores, a focus on great value — Five Below is starting to look in some ways more like a warehouse club than a discount store.\n\n\"Five Below is essentially the Costco for kids,\" Bellinger said. \"Maybe you want to get some core birthday or party items, and then you wind up expanding your basket and buying all these things you didn't know were there. And then it leads you to your next visit, and you just keep coming back.\"\n\nThe success of the past year will raise the expectations for next year's quarterly comparable sales numbers, but Five Below still has several levers it says it can pull to meet the moment.\n\nBellinger said investors are keen to see whether the recent changes at Five Below have led to a structural shift that will drive long-term performance.\n\nThe average Five Below store generates annual sales of around $2.1 million, but Bellinger said Park's initiatives could significantly boost that number: \"Why can't that be a $3 million store now, or even higher?\"",
