    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates continue to move within a narrow lane, according to Zillow. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.03%, and the 15-year fixed rate is 5.42%. The rates you'll find locally are likely to vary quite a bit. Shop multiple mortgage lenders to get your best interest rate offer.\n\nMORE: See the mortgage lenders with the best rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nLearn whether now is a good time to refinance your mortgage.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage terms and interest rates will impact your monthly payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use. It also considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when determining your estimated monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a more realistic idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThe average 30-year mortgage rate today is 6.03%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is lower than with a shorter-term loan.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.42% today. When deciding between a 15-year and a 30-year mortgage, consider your short-term versus long-term goals.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to accumulate. But the trade-off is that your monthly payment will be higher as you pay off the same amount in half the time.\n\nLet’s say you get a $300,000 mortgage. With a 30-year term and a 6.03% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,804, and you’d pay $349,599 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.42% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,439. But you’d only pay $138,936 in interest over the years.\n\nWith a fixed-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for the entire life of your loan. You will get a new rate if you refinance your mortgage, though.\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for a predetermined period of time. Then, the rate will go up or down depending on several factors, such as the economy and the maximum amount your rate can change according to your contract. For example, with a 7/1 ARM, your rate would be locked in for the first seven years, then change every year for the remaining 23 years of your term.\n\nAdjustable rates typically start lower than fixed rates, but once the initial rate-lock period ends, it’s possible your rate will go up. Lately, though, some fixed rates have been starting lower than adjustable rates. Talk to your lender about its rates before choosing one or the other.\n\nRead more about fixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgages.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, great or excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So, if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nWaiting for rates to drop probably isn’t the best method to get the lowest mortgage rate right now. If you’re ready to buy, focusing on your personal finances is probably the best way to lower your rate.\n\nTo find the best mortgage lender for your situation, apply for mortgage preapproval with three or four companies. Just be sure to apply to all of them within a short time frame — doing so will give you the most accurate comparisons and have less of an impact on your credit score.\n\nWhen choosing a lender, don’t just compare interest rates. Look at the mortgage annual percentage rate (APR) — this factors in the interest rate, any discount points, and fees. The APR, which is also expressed as a percentage, reflects the true annual cost of borrowing money. This is probably the most important number to look at when comparing mortgage lenders.\n\nLearn 6 tips for choosing a mortgage lender.\n\nAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate for purchasing a home is 6.03%, and the average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.42%. But these are national averages, so the average in your area could be different. Averages are typically higher in expensive parts of the U.S. and lower in less expensive areas.\n\nThe average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.03% right now, according to Zillow. However, you might get an even better rate with an excellent credit score, sizable down payment, and low debt-to-income ratio (DTI).\n\nEconomists don't expect drastic mortgage rate drops before the end of 2026. Even with the recent cut to the federal funds rate, mortgage rates continue to hover within a range — barely moving since mid-October.\n\nThe best mortgage lenders offer low interest rates, a range of loan programs, and high customer satisfaction. Choose the best mortgage lender for your needs.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nYou can usually refinance your mortgage with the same bank or lender, but you don’t have to. Learn the pros and cons of using the same lender.\n\nYou can get a low-cost refinance by shopping for mortgage lenders or boosting your credit score. Learn how to lower your refi costs, both at closing and long term.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nA mortgage refinance can cost 2% to 6% of the loan amount. Learn what impacts these costs and how to lower or eliminate what you pay up front.",

    "description": "Look at the data and charts of the UK's historic interest rates since 1694 and learn about its economic history.",
    "fullText": "Lets look at a history of interest rates in the UK (or England…)\n\nInterest rates in England began in 1694. The government needed to raise money to rebuild the Royal Navy in the Nine Years’ War. It set up an entity called “The Bank” and asked it for a loan of £1.2 million.\n\nThis is how the Bank of England was formed.\n\n(The loan was finally paid off in 1994).\n\nIn over 300 years of UK interest rates and economic history, we can see rates have been high, and rates have been low. (Though the lowest has been in recent memory)\n\nBut lets zoom to our era of economic history.\n\nIt is the turn of the milennium, Britpop is at its height, fears of the Y2K bug didn’t come true, and the dot com bubble finally bursts.\n\nBecause of concerns of a UK economic slowdown, the Bank of England’s (BoE) Monetary Policy Committee lowers interest rates\n\nA hop, skip, and a jump to 2007. Steve Jobs unveils the iPhone, The Spice Girls re-unite for a tour, and we all start yelling “THIS IS SPARTA!” after watching 300.\n\nAlso, there is the foreshadowing of a financial crash. House foreclosures begin in the US, and there is a tightening of household credit in the UK.\n\nThen the unimaginable happens on 15 September 2008. After a radical devaluation of its assets, Lehman Brothers, a 150 year old investment bank goes bust. The US govt refuses to bail it out.\n\nThe US Treasury believes the effects will be contained…\n\nA special Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting is called.\n\nThe UK govt co-ordinates with other G8 countries, and drastically drops rates. A program of quantitative easing begins. Most people (including me) still don’t fully understand what that is.\n\nFrom 2009 we have our era of low interest rates and quantitative easing. Or “cheap money”.\n\nOther features include UK (and Europe) austerity; a Euro sovereign debt crisis; and a tech boom in the US.\n\nBrexit – 23 June 2016. No need to say more.\n\nIn the aftermath of Brexit, The BoE introduces a slew of measures to cushion the UK economy after fluctuations in Sterling. Mark Carney makes economists sexy again after he says the “British economy is serene” to the Treasury Select Committee.\n\nThe BoE cuts rates and introduces further policy measures to prop up the economy during lockdown.\n\nOctober 2021 – Inflation breaks the 2% target and reaches 3%. The first time since 2012.\n\nDecember 2021. The BoE raises rates for the first time since Covid. Inflation is at 4.8%.\n\nThe story starts to ramp up here…\n\n24 February 2022 – Russia invades Ukraine. Global commodity prices such as energy and food sharply rise. The Bank of England raises rates in March 2022.\n\nIn a twist of irony, the BoE meets on the 21st September 2022 and raises rates, because of the two inflationary tailwinds: a demand shock, and energy prices.\n\nIronic, because two days later, Kwasi Kwarteng unveils his “growth plan” (or what I call a piece of economic kamikaze).borrowing a lot of money to enable “growth” in the UK economy.\n\nThe plan is simple. Cut taxes with no plan to balance the books.\n\nWhere will the govt get money to pay for stuff? Why well they’ll borrow the money in the short term, and future growth will balance things out.\n\nWhat kind of growth you ask? Oh. That’s not their business. No need to have a plan for that. Growth will come.\n\nThe, uh, markets have something to say about the “growth plan” (or mini budget).\n\nMortgage rates spike as UK gilts (UK treasury bonds) rise drastically in price. The Bank of England raises rates, as while energy prices have stabilised, UK asset prices have risen due to “UK specific factors”.\n\nThe most understated economic commentary I’ve ever heard.\n\nInflation starts to slow (10.1% to 8.7%)\n\nBut wages are heating up – rising beyond forecasts.\n\nFearing a wage-price spiral, the BoE raises rates by 0.5%.\n\n21 September 2023, mortgage holders and the entire country breathes a small sigh of relief.\n\nFor the first time since December 2021, when the MPC meet, they they do not raise rates.\n\nThey maintain the previous rate of 5.25%.\n\nWith a GDP contraction, and a loosening of the labour market, the signs of high rates are working. However, the economy is now cooling. The goal is to get a “soft landing”.\n\nCool down inflation, which means cooling the economy a bit, but don’t trigger a recession or high unemployment.\n\n9 May 2024. The BoE continues to maintain rates. Inflation is down to 3.2% and is projected to be near its target in the next couple of years. However, fearing persistent inflation, the BoE doesn’t lower rates.\n\n1 August 2024, the country breathes a deeper sigh of relief.\n\nInterest rates are lowered for the first time since the cost of living crisis began.\n\n18 December 2025 – with inflation being 0.2% below forecasts, and continuing to fall, and unemployment ticking up to 5.1%, the Bank of England continues its gradual decrease of interest rates, lowering rates to 3.75%\n\nInterest rates provide a fascinating window on economic history.\n\nIn our little window of time, interest rates play a big role in managing inflation, ensuring prices don’t rise out of control, and the economy keeps ticking.\n\nThe goal is for inflation to be kept at 2% to 2.5%. Where interest rates go will depend on economic matters inside the country\n\nAnd geopolitical events outside the country.\n\nWhatever happens… UK economic history will continue to be written with interest rates.\n\nYou can read a more in-depth history of interest rates from 2000 here.\n\nI can’t guess that, but I can let you know when next they’re updated with my data journalism newsletter. \n\nSign-up form not appearing above?

Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various interest rates and loan amounts will affect your monthly payments. It also shows how the term length plays into things.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. You even have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues if those apply to you. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThere are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.\n\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.\n\nThe main disadvantage of 30-year fixed mortgage rates is the mortgage interest, both in the short and long term.\n\nA 30-year fixed-term loan comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed-term loan. You’ll also pay much \n\nThe pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are essentially swapped with those of 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.\n\nHowever, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.\n\nDetermine whether to get a 15-year vs. 30-year mortgage.\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined amount of time, then change it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.\n\nThe main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't reflect this, though — fixed rates are actually lower, according to Zillow data. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)\n\nWith an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.\n\nBut if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.\n\nRead about the differences between adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgages.\n\nThe national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.09% right now, according to Zillow. But keep in mind that averages can vary depending on where you live. For example, if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be even higher.\n\nEconomists don't expect drastic mortgage rate drops before the end of 2026. Even with the most recent cut to the federal funds rate, mortgage rates continue to hover within a range — barely moving since mid-October. The Fed is currently signaling a single rate cut for 2026, with perhaps one more in 2027.\n\nRecently, mortgage rates have been hovering in a range — but there has been a general move lower over the past couple of months. According to Freddie Mac data, they remain about a half-point below where they were one year ago.\n\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.\n\nChase Home Loans is offering a \"refinancing rate sale\" for rate-and-term and cash-out refinancing.

    "fullText": "When Gbenga Ajilore thinks about America's job market, a few things keep him up at night: The slowing demand for entry-level talent, tariff chaos, and high interest rates.\n\n\"There is going to come a point where AI is just a part of everything that we do, but we're not there yet,\" Ajilore, who is chief economist at the left-leaning Center for Budget Policy and Priorities, said, adding, \"The economy is paralyzed.\"\n\nThe labor market is showing clear signs of weakness. Long-term unemployment has been trending upward, and the share of Americans looking for work recently eclipsed the number of available roles. Alongside a steady drum of layoff headlines, unemployment ticked up more than expected last month to 4.6%. Young people are having trouble breaking in, older workers are hesitant to retire, and with the \"flattening\" of many companies, the middle rungs of the career ladder are crumbling. Only healthcare and construction showed substantial growth. It's been called the white-collar recession, an unwelcome awakening for Americans who hoped their college degree would translate to long-term stability and a comfortable salary.\n\nGiven the timing, it's easy to villainize artificial intelligence. C-Suite leaders across industries have said they're \"all in on AI,\" often to the dismay of rank-and-file employees. The tech is quickly reshaping how workers are assessed on the job and how companies define productivity. It's even shaking up the hiring process: My colleagues have talked to job seekers who submitted hundreds of résumés without landing a role, as HR departments are swamped by AI-assisted applications. Economists and investors can't agree if chatbots are the future of the workforce or a vastly overblown bubble.\n\nBut, in shouldering the blame for America's job market woes, AI has become a scapegoat for something else: The economy itself is deteriorating. Years of higher interest rates and stubborn inflation, along with slowing wage growth and restrictive trade policies, have created an environment where businesses are slashing budgets and the middle class is living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nIf you're frustrated by a lower-than-expected raise or the inability to land a new gig, don't blame the robots. Blame Jerome Powell.\n\nThere is no better example of the AI-is-wrecking-the-job-market fears than the so-called \"Scariest Chart in the World.\" The chart has popped up in X and Bluesky posts, news reports, and a thick stack of Substack newsletters. The simple, two-line chart tracks two pieces of data: the S&P 500 and the number of US job vacancies since 2015. The two run closely together for the first couple of years, but there is a decided break in 2022 — the stock market continues to soar, and the number of available jobs begins to decline. AI doomers are quick to point out that the date those two lines diverged corresponds to the public launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT. The implication being that the explosion of large language models immediately began replacing thousands of jobs while pouring money into Wall Street.\n\nAs chatbots and AI tools make employees more productive — drafting emails, writing code, and streamlining administrative tasks — and employers more profitable, the thinking goes, there will be less need for hiring human workers. There's plenty of anecdotal evidence from high-profile companies to support the idea. Nvidia wants employees to use AI \"for every task possible,\" Microsoft is \"rethinking\" its business model for the AI age, Big Law is hoping AI can make its services faster and cheaper, and top banks and consulting firms are transferring some tasks from people to bots.\n\nBut is AI already replacing a bunch of jobs? Probably not.\n\nAjilore thinks the AI-sparked white collar downturn is \"overblown.\" Many companies are \"using AI as a cheat code as opposed to something that makes them more efficient,\" he said, \"With the cheat code, you actually end up making mistakes and cutting corners.\" He believes that both chatbots and Corporate America's tech strategy have a long way to go before AI truly disrupts the workforce.\n\nEven Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the most powerful economic policymaker in the world, isn't sold on AI's effects on the current job market. When asked about the technology during the Fed's December meeting, Powell said AI \"is part of the story, but it's not a big part of the story yet.\"\n\nThere's also an important piece of context missing from \"The Scariest Chart in the World\": the federal funds rate. Decided eight times a year by Powell and his colleagues on the all-important (and dully-named) Federal Open Markets Committee, the Fed funds rate is the key interest rate that anchors all types of loans. For banks and businesses, the number determines how easily and cheaply they can borrow money. For consumers, Fed rates impact everything from home prices to auto loans and credit card rates.\n\nWhen interest rates are low, businesses can access debt more affordably, which helps them fuel growth and hiring. As the fed fund rate increases, however, the price of borrowing rises too. This can help keep inflation in check, but higher rates make it more expensive for companies to operate, meaning that many are seeking other areas to cut costs — often at the expense of employees.\n\nIt's true that the S&P 500 and job openings began to diverge right as ChatGPT launched, but that's also when interest rates started to climb. Between early 2022 and late 2024, federal funds jumped by over 5 percentage points. This was a reshaping of monetary strategy meant to curb soaring prices and cool off a too-hot economy, and it was a major break with nearly a generation of previous policy. The Fed originally slashed interest rates to zero in 2008 to address the fallout from the financial crisis, and in the following 12 years, the benchmark interest rate never rose above 2.4%. Following the emergency measures of the early pandemic, the dramatic hikes of 2022 were a sign that the zero-interest-rate era of the 2010s had officially come to an end.\n\nThis sudden interest rate rise was a turning point many businesses. «tweaked the wording here since it was similar to a sentence in the graf above Hiring boomed in the early pandemic: Job openings skyrocketed to record highs as tech and business fields scrambled to snap up new talent. The Beige Book — a collection of quotes and insights gathered from business owners across the country by the various regional Federal Reserve banks — provides a valuable window into the thinking of hiring managers and executives during this period. Labor market commentary across 2021 and 2022 Beige Books tend to reference \"modest to strong\" job growth, robust hiring demand, and a shortage of workers, with very few mentions of interest rates. This changed when the Fed started hiking rates. One note in the November 2022 edition of the Beige Book said that \"Interest rates and inflation continued to weigh on activity,\" another said \"labor demand weakened overall,\" pointing to layoffs in tech, finance, and real estate. Both blue-collar and white-collar sectors felt the brunt of interest rates that year, citing steep borrowing costs as a central reason they're not hiring. Americans, meanwhile, stopped quitting their jobs as vacancies dried up, and the job market saw its biggest layoff spike since the 2020 shutdown.\n\nCorporate America began to lean into \"efficiency\" rhetoric alongside rising rates. Reduced bureaucracy and red tape, along with a smaller workforce, were sold by the C-Suite as a profit panacea in the face of higher financing costs. Leaders at Meta, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and others spoke about hiring freezes and job cuts as a productivity bet versus a financial issue.\n\nThe trend continued: An October 2023 Beige Book note said many sectors \"reduced hiring plans\" and were \"rightsizing\" their budgets because of rising rates. Fast forward to today, and businesses are still grappling with the increased cost of funding, even as Powell and the Fed have moved slowly to lower their benchmark rate. In October's Beige Book, businesses big and small mentioned layoffs and attrition more so than new hiring. Beige Book reports over the past year suggest that AI is contributing to hiring softening in certain areas, such as call centers and accounting firms, but not widespread job displacement. Instead, \"uncertainty\" and \"tariffs\" were two of the most frequently mentioned words by companies such as Tesla, JPMorgan, and Whirlpool during earnings calls.\n\nBut saying the need for layoffs is the result of a long-term change in the cost of financing isn't very sexy. Better to point to AI as both an excuse for layoffs and a way to give investors hope for the future. Chen Zhao, head of economics research at the real estate firm Redfin, said many companies are struggling to balance profits with the steep cost of borrowing money. This is especially true in the housing sector, she said, because it's sensitive to the federal funds rate. She said fields like tech are similarly vulnerable.\n\n\"I think that what's happening is just simple economics,\" she said, adding, \"But when you say that you're going to do layoffs or you're not going to be hiring as much, it doesn't sound very good to investors. It sounds a lot better if you say that you're seeing all these productivity enhancements because of AI.\"\n\nEach recent technological development — computers, cellphones, the internet — has reshaped the job market and the workplace, but people tend to underestimate the timeline. Economists said it will take years, possibly decades, before we have concrete evidence that AI is replacing jobs on a large scale. And AI may create thousands of jobs as it makes others obsolete.\n\n\"I think the overall evolution of the technology is going to be a lot slower than both the optimists and doomers think,\" said Scott Lincicome, vice president of economics and trade at the right-leaning Cato Institute. AI has developed rapidly, and while it can perform basic tasks, it is still a long way from replacing human judgment, creativity, and decision-making. \"There will certainly be disruptions, that's inevitable,\" he said. \"But it won't be cataclysmic.\"\n\nThe job market is in a rut — but chatbots aren't the sole, or even the main, culprit.\n\nDespite the weakening job market numbers, the Federal Reserve has cut rates three times this year, a cautious policy stance brought on by economic precarity. Recent Fed reports show that trade policy and inflation are keeping Powell and company from cutting rates at a faster pace, even as the employment outlook weakens. It has also sparked division within the central bank itself: The December meeting saw the highest number of Fed members disagreeing with the interest rate committee's final decision since 2019. Economic projections also show the median committee member expects one rate cut in 2026, less than projected at this time last year. The moves signal an economic situation that isn't catastrophic, so long as Powell plays his cards carefully.\n\nA pattern of cuts could start bringing relief for borrowers, but it will take time for the economy to recover — and there are still steep headwinds. Fast-changing tariffs are exacerbating the impact of high rates, making many businesses hesitant to invest or spend money. As Lincicome put it, \"Tariff uncertainty is really a drag on the job market because companies are saddled with millions, if not billions, of dollars in additional taxes and tariff costs.\"\n\nDeclining immigration due to Trump's deportation policies is also part of the equation: Fewer immigrants in the workforce is contributing to a slowing labor force participation rate. Ajilore also said that the sweeping cost-cutting strategy of DOGE for the federal workforce added fuel to the corporate world's \"efficiency\" crusade. It all adds up to some extremely valid job anxiety for workers.\n\nEconomists expect the market to grow and adapt alongside new technology — and the AI takeover forecast is far less grim than most people realize. The chatbot revolution may come someday. But, for better or worse, the real headliner is the federal funds rate.\n\nAllie Kelly is a reporter on Business Insider's Economy team.

See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates remain in a comfortable routine. According to Zillow data, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.13%, and the 15-year fixed rate is 5.53%. The Federal Reserve announced a third interest rate cut last week, and mortgage rates shrugged. The 30-year interest rate has barely moved since the end of October.\n\nSee which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nMORE: Read about the best mortgage refinance lenders right now.\n\nYou can use the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator below to play around with how different terms and rates will affect your monthly payment. Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders.\n\nToday’s average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.13%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low.\n\nIf you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 6.13% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,824, and you’d pay $356,569 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.53% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to compound.\n\nHowever, your monthly payments will be higher because you’re squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.53% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,456. But you’d only pay $142,085 in interest over the life of the loan.\n\nHow much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\n\nWith an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year.\n\nAdjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate goes up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends — that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later.\n\nLately, ARM rates have occasionally been similar to or higher than fixed rates. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nYou can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown is also an option — for example, maybe you get a 6.25% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4.25% for year one, increase to 5.25% for year two, then settle in at 6.25% for the remainder of your term.\n\nJust consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself if you’ll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.\n\nHere are interest rates for some of the most popular mortgage terms: According to Zillow data, the national average 30-year fixed rate is 6.13%, the 15-year fixed rate is 5.53%, and the 5/1 ARM rate is 6.24%.\n\nA normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 6.13%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data. The average might be higher or lower depending on where you live in the U.S. And of course, your credit score.\n\nNot much. According to its November forecast, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.4% through 2026. Fannie Mae also predicts a 30-year rate above 6% through next year, yet dipping down to 5.9% in Q4 2026.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity.

See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates are barely moving, refusing to react to the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate cut.

Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nWant to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025? Here's what to do.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how today's interest rates would affect your monthly mortgage payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. You also have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues, if applicable. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThere are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.\n\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.\n\nThe main disadvantage of 30-year fixed mortgage rates is the mortgage interest, both in the short and long term.\n\nA 30-year fixed term comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed term, and it’s higher than the intro rate to a 30-year ARM. The higher your rate, the higher your monthly payment. You’ll also pay much \n\nThe pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are basically swapped with those of the 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.\n\nHowever, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.\n\nDig deeper into 15-year vs. 30-year mortgages.\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined amount of time, then change it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.\n\nThe main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't necessarily reflect this, though — in some cases, fixed rates are actually lower. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)\n\nWith an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.\n\nBut if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.\n\nLearn whether now is a good time to get an adjustable-rate mortgage.\n\nFirst of all, now is a relatively good time to buy a house compared to a couple of years ago. Home prices aren't spiking like they were during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. So, if you want or need to buy a house soon, you should feel pretty good about the current housing market.\n\nThe best time to buy is typically whenever it makes sense for your stage of life. Trying to time the real estate market can be as futile as timing the stock market — buy when it's the right time for you.\n\nWhich is more important, your home price or mortgage rate?\n\nAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.13% right now. But keep in mind that mortgage rates vary by state and even ZIP code. For example, if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be higher.\n\nEconomists don't expect mortgage interest rates to significantly drop before the end of the year. They may inch down here or there, but they probably won't plummet.\n\nOverall, mortgage rates have dropped gradually. The 30-year fixed rate is still below where it was one year ago.\n\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.\n\nWith mortgage rates hovering above 6%, is now a good time to refinance your mortgage?

    "description": "The Fed cut interest rates at its December meeting. Here's how it affects your money — from mortgages and auto loans to credit cards and savings.",
    "fullText": "The Federal Reserve made its final decision of 2025, cutting interest rates for the third meeting in a row — and it set the tone for where interest rates will go in the new year.\n\nThe call will have ripple effects across consumer prices, the job market, and Corporate America through 2026 and beyond. Here's how the decision will affect you.\n\nThirty-year fixed mortgages, two-year auto loans, and credit card rates tend to fluctuate alongside the federal funds rate. And, while inflation remains above the Fed's 2% goal, mortgage rates have largely cooled in recent months in anticipation of rate reductions.\n\nA quarter-point cut could mean lower returns on investment for savers using high-yield savings accounts or certificates of deposit, though it would become cheaper to pay off credit cards. Lower rates would also make home equity lines and small business loans more accessible to Americans.\n\nElizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, told Business Insider the cut could be a positive sign for people applying to roles in the sluggish labor market: If job seekers \"hear that the Fed is responding to an unfavorable labor market, that's going to feel good to them; they may feel like relief is on the horizon,\" she said.\n\nThe labor market has shown signs of weakness in recent months. Job seekers of all ages have told Business Insider that they've been through grueling application cycles without an offer, while recruiters are drowning in resumés. Over the summer, the number of Americans looking for work eclipsed the number of available jobs and labor force participation has been trending downward. The unemployment rate, however, is still relatively low, hovering a little above 4% for most of this year.\n\nSustained rate cuts would bolster the job market by making it easier for businesses to borrow and invest money. This would free up more funds for companies to hire and pay employees, which could lead to higher consumer spending — all factors needed for a healthy economy.\n\nAnd lower interest rates are historically good news for the stock market. When it's cheaper to borrow money and approve loans, both companies and individuals are more likely to invest. With more funds in the market, Wall Street could see a boost in 2026.\n\nMadison Hoff contributed reporting.",

    "fullText": "The Fed cut interest rates for the third time this year on Wednesday, and the meeting held some key takeaways for how the central bank is thinking about the economy heading into 2026.\n\nFrom the labor market to inflation to stocks, here's everything to know about the latest Fed decision.\n\nFed leaders anticipate more economic growth in 2026 and stable unemployment levels, but are somewhat concerned about slowing labor demand and participation. Lower rates could help juice hiring, Powell said.\n\nIn terms of AI, the Fed chair said chatbots are not yet replacing jobs — even as Corporate America sees shrinking while collar roles. \"It's part of the story, but it's not a big part of the story yet,\" he said. And, though some Big Tech firms and major retailers, have had high-profile cuts in 2025, Powell added that overall layoff rates are still relatively low.\n\nThe figure remains slightly above the Fed's 2% goal, though data is limited due to the government shutdown. With lower rates, there's a risk consumer prices will rise too. At the same time, Powell said consumer spending has been strong and the main driver of inflation right now is tariff policy, not broad economic weakness.\n\nIt was a hawkish rate cut overall, but markets rallied sharply anyway.\n\nThe S&P 500 edged up to a near-record close and the Dow jump almost 500 points, adding to gains as Powell's press conference got going. A few things came out of the meeting that boosted investors' bullishness.\n\nWith Powell's term up in May, Trump is set to name a successor in January.\n\n\"I really want to turn this job over to whoever replaces me with the economy in really good shape,\" he said. \"I want inflation to be back down to 2% and I want the labor market to be strong — that's what I want. All of my efforts are to get to that place.\"\n\nMembers of the Federal Open Market Committee showed significant division on Wednesday, with three members dissenting to the cut call. It's the biggest split seen at a Fed meeting since 2019 and signals ongoing tension between the Fed's dual mandate and how each member weighs employment and inflation risks.\n\nPowell, however, said there's no bad blood.\n\n\"The discussions we have are as good as any we've had in my 14 years at the Fed,\" he said. \"They're very thoughtful and respectful and people have strong views",

    "description": "Investors expect the Fed to cut rates on Wednesday and keep cutting in 2026, but bond yields are hinting at deeper uncertainty ahead for markets.",
    "fullText": "Markets think a rate cut on Wednesday is nearly a foregone conclusion, but bond yields are doing something strange.\n\nDespite a cut being priced in for weeks, US government bonds have been selling off, driving yields higher. The 10-year Treasury yield has jumped by about 20 basis points from its low in November, hovering around 4.20%. on Wednesday.\n\nIt's a reminder that long-term bond yields and the Fed's short-term borrowing rate do not move in lockstep, but it's still an unusual move given predictions for rates to keep coming down in 2026.\n\nThere are a few things that help explain the move.\n\nFront and center for bond investors is the inflation outlook, and it's murky, to say the least.\n\nWhile price growth has cooled in the US since peaking around 9% in the summer of 2022, inflation has crept back up in recent months.\n\nIf the Fed cuts interest rates too quickly, that could stoke fresh inflation. That concern has grown even more pressing to investors in recent weeks as President Donald Trump is expected to announce his pick for the next Fed Chair.\n\nKevin Hassett, a Trump ally who has long supported the president's view that interest rates should be significantly lower, has emerged as the top candidate in recent weeks.\n\n\"The biggest thing happening in the background is the question of who will lead the Fed,\" Christian Hoffmann, the head of fixed income at Thornburg Investment Management, said, pointing to Hassett's potential influence over the market's monetary policy expectations even before the new Fed Chair is sworn in.\n\nThe calculus being made in the bond market seems to be that Hassett could lower rates too far, too fast, aggravating inflation and prompting a hawkish response from the Fed down the road.\n\n\"Something that every Fed Chair has traditionally had to do from day one is establish credibility as a legitimate inflation fighter. If they don't, they introduce volatility into the Treasury markets and create broad unease, which no one wants,\" he added.\n\nTorsten Sløk, the chief economist at Apollo, also flicked at this disconnect between rate expectations and bond yields in a note on Wednesday.\n\n\"Why are long-term interest rates going up when the Fed is cutting rates,\" Sløk wrote. \"Is the market worried about growing Treasury issuance, or about a new Fed leadership effectively raising the inflation target from 2% to, say, 4%?\" he added, referring to how higher debt levels can also stoke inflation in the future.\n\nEven without inflation complicating things, investors aren't confident that the Fed has the green light to keep cutting rates in 2026.\n\nInterest rates already appear to be close to neutral, a level that prompts neither economic expansion nor contraction, according to Chris Brigati, the chief investment officer at SWBC.\n\n\"We expect the Fed to remain on hold when it comes to rates for the first half of 2026, even with the pressure from the many doves,\" Brigati said on Wednesday, adding that he only expects the Fed to issue one rate cut next year.\n\nStrategists at Deutsche Bank said this week that they expect the 10-year US Treasury to climb to around 4.45% by mid-next year, a jump of about 25 basis points from current levels.\n\n\"This mildly bearish view is predicated on expectations of a more hawkish Fed rate cut path than market pricing,\" the bank wrote in a note on Tuesday.\n\nInvestors are pricing in a 58% chance the Fed will only lower interest rates once or twice by the end of 2026, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nThe US bond market is following a broader trend as investors expect less monetary easing from central banks around the world in the coming year.\n\nThe yield on the British 10-year gilt traded around 4.52% on Wednesday, around 14 basis points higher than its low in November.\n\nThe yield on the German 10-year Bund also rose to 2.86% on Wednesday, around 22 basis points higher from its latest low.\n\nJapan's 10-year note was yielding around 1.95% this week, up around 29 basis points from the start of November.\n\n\"Long-dated government bonds in many developed markets (DMs) have sold off aggressively over the past month or so as investors have pared back rate cut expectations or, increasingly, pencilled in rate hikes,\" James Reilly, a senior markets economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note on Tuesday.\n\n\"While we think these moves are overdone in many economies, we think there is still room for investors to pare back expectations for Fed easing,\" he added.",

There will also likely be a handful of central bankers who will give \"soft dissents\" on where they see monetary policy going forward in the dot plot, he added.\n\nWhile investors expect the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points, officials will probably send out some hawkish signals to the market on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs said.\n\nFed officials will likely suggest that the bar is higher for rate cuts going into next year, David Mericle, Goldman's chief US economist, wrote in a client note on Sunday.

Thirty-year fixed mortgages, two-year auto loans, and credit card rates tend to fluctuate alongside the federal funds rate.\n\nAnd, while inflation remains above the Fed's 2% goal, mortgage rates have largely cooled in recent months in anticipation of rate reductions. Lower rates could also make home equity lines and small business loans more affordable — though savers might see less return on their high-yield savings accounts.\n\nInvestors seem to be pricing in a \"sell the news\" reaction to Wednesday's rate decision, strategists at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note on Monday.\n\nThe bank added, though, that it remains optimistic about the market's direction over the medium term. That's because the job market looks on track to show moderate weakness in the coming months, which should clear the path for Fed rate cuts in 2026. Stronger earnings should also help lift the market higher, the bank said.\n\nPowell has said the Fed's cautious strategy this year stems from uncertainty over President Donald Trump's fast-changing tariff policies and stubborn inflation rates. The job market, meanwhile, has had a rocky 2025.\n\nBusiness Insider has heard from frustrated job seekers at all levels of the career ladder, particularly those feeling pushed out of white collar roles.

This past summer, the number of Americans looking for work eclipsed the number of vacancies, though the unemployment rate itself is still relatively low.\n\n\"There is no risk-free path for policy as we navigate this tension between our employment and inflation goals,\" Powell said in October, adding, \"Ultimately, lower rates will support more demand, and that'll support hiring over time. And, of course, we also have to be careful about this.\"\n\nThe Fed's dual mandate is to keep America's prices stable and the labor market healthy. These two goals have been challenging to balance this year: higher interest rates can help curb inflation but risk cooling down an already chilly labor market.\n\nThe Fed is also missing key pieces of data due to the government shutdown. The Bureau of Labor Statistics canceled the October consumer price index and unemployment rate releases, and the November jobs report and inflation data won't be released in time for today's meeting. December's decision will be more difficult without this information.\n\nUS stock futures are virtually unmoved as of just before 6:20 a.m. ET. Futures for all three of the Dow Jones, the Nasdaq, and the S&P 500 have moved less than 0.1% lower so far in this morning's trading.\n\nThere's a little more movement in European stocks, though nothing too drastic.

Changes to this outlook will be top of mind for investors on Wednesday.\n\nInvestors will also be closely watching for further disagreement among Fed officials, as October's policy statement revealed two members of the FOMC voted against the decision to lower rates by 0.25%.\n\nIn today's Morning Brief newsletter, Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban asks: Why are bond yields rising as the Fed cuts rates?\n\nYahoo Finance's Ivana Pino reports:\n\nGlobal bond yields have risen to highs not seen since 2009 ahead of a key Federal Reserve policy meeting.

Here's what you need to know about how the federal funds rate impacts certificates of deposit (CDs).\n\nYahoo Finance's Ivana Pino reports:\n\nMany prospective homebuyers may be wondering, \"When will mortgage rates go back down to 3%?\" The quick answer, according to Yahoo Finance's Hal Bundrick, is that it's not likely anytime soon.\n\nUS stocks were little changed at Tuesday's close as traders bet that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to CME Group's FedWatch tool, traders assigned a 87.6% probability to the Fed cutting rates by 25 basis points, down marginally from odds placed on a cut a day ago.\n\nAlthough stocks were muted in the lead-up to the Fed decision, one strategist noted that Chair Jerome Powell's comments at the press conference will likely affect market sentiment heading into 2026.\n\n“A 25 basis point cut is important for investor sentiment, not necessarily for many of the companies that we invest in,\" Siebert Financial chief investment officer Mark Malek told Yahoo Finance about how the Fed decision could affect investments. \"This 25 basis points is not going to make or break a lot of these companies.\"\n\nBarring a major deterioration in the labor market, Malek expects the Fed to try to temper expectations for further rate cuts. That's why Powell's remarks on the labor market will be especially scrutinized, he said.\n\n\"It is important that the Fed is showing that they're concerned about the labor market,\" Malek said. \"It's good for the consumer to know that the Fed's got their backs, if people are worried about their jobs, or maybe they're going to pull back on spending after the holiday season.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower short-term interest rates on Wednesday for the third time this year, affecting the interest consumers pay and receive on many of their accounts.\n\nYahoo Finance's Hal Bundrick breaks down how discounts to the federal funds rate will impact deposits, credit, and debt:\n\n2025 has been a year of modest earnings on deposit accounts. Another rate cut won't help.\n\nThe national average of interest paid on checking accounts has barely budged much this year and remains at 0.07%. Interest rates on savings accounts are only marginally better, remaining at 0.40%.\n\nImagine that moving even lower. Is it possible? Yes.\n\nStock prices often react to the Fed’s rate actions, but they are only one factor among many affecting the investing climate and stock prices.\n\nIf you intend to manage your investments to suit the current environment, keep watch on broader economic and corporate profit trends alongside interest rates. If you prefer to stay conservative, fill your portfolio with high-quality stocks that have proven themselves in all economic cycles.\n\nThen, wait patiently for long-term growth.\n\nRead more about how the Fed affects your money here.\n\nAs markets look ahead to the path of Federal Reserve policy in 2026, President Trump offered one clue in an interview with Politico released Tuesday.\n\nTrump responded “yes” when asked if quickly reducing interest rates would be a litmus test for his choice of central bank leader. Trump has a list of five candidates to replace current Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term expires in May 2026.\n\n“Yes. Well, this guy ... should too,” Trump said, referring to Powell. “I think he’s a combination of not a smart person and doesn’t like Trump.”\n\nStocks were muted at the market open on Tuesday after a Federal Reserve spokesperson confirmed the FOMC meeting was underway.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was flat and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.2%. All three indexes came off modest losses on Monday.\n\nTreasury yields steadied as investors awaited the release of jobs data and the Federal Open Market Committee's policy decision.\n\nThe benchmark 10-year yield (^TNX) fell 2 basis points to 4.14%. Meanwhile, the 30-year yield (^TYX) declined 3 basis points to 4.78% after hitting its highest level in about three months on Monday.\n\nRead more about today's market action here.\n\nThe consensus around the Federal Reserve’s policy move on Wednesday has firmed around a 25 basis point rate cut — even if the decision will be a close one, as Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger details.\n\nTraders are pricing in an 89% chance that the Fed lowers interest rates by 25 basis points at the conclusion of the FOMC meeting on Wednesday, according to CMEGroup's FedWatch.\n\nBut looking ahead to the January meeting and 2026 broadly, the path is even less certain.\n\nOne widely held view is that the Fed will move forward with a \"hawkish cut\" on Wednesday, in which the central bank lowers rates but hints at a pause in January, JPMorgan’s Michael Feroli wrote in a Dec. 5 note. Traders have put a 23% probability that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting rates at its Jan. 27-28 meeting.\n\n“At the press conference, we expect that Powell will stress that with policy rates close to neutral, the time for risk management cuts is past and that further cuts would only come with a material deterioration in the labor market,” Feroli wrote.\n\n\"We don’t expect him to comment directly on January,\" Feroli added, \"but instead to highlight that there is a lot of data to be released between now and the January meeting and that will guide their decision.\"\n\nFor the remainder of the year, views range from the Fed cutting rates at its next few policy meetings due to a deterioration in the labor market to additional rate cuts in the summer due to a change in Fed leadership.\n\nRead more about 2026 predictions for Federal Reserve policy here.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's eventful 2025 wraps up this week, and another 0.25% rate cut is expected.\n\nBut the real drama in the central bank's release will be in how much agreement, or not, there is with this decision.\n\nAs Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger noted in her preview of the event, at least three regional Fed presidents have signaled that the case for cutting rates this week does not appear obvious. One of those includes Kansas City Fed president Jeff Schmid, who voted against October's rate cut.\n\nAdd in that Fed Governor Stephen Miran has twice dissented in favor of a larger rate cut, the central bank could be looking at upward of four votes against the expected decision to lower rates by another 0.25% on Wednesday.\n\nRead Jennifer's full preview of the meeting here.",

    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance rates. People shouldn't necessarily wait until after the Fed meeting to lock in a rate, as rates are likely to hold steady.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates have risen since last week. According to Zillow data, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is up 13 basis points to 6.10%, and the 15-year fixed rate has increased by 14 basis points to 5.55%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will announce whether it is cutting the federal funds rate for a third time this year on Wednesday. Many experts predict that the central bank will lower its rate again — but based on how mortgage rates have reacted to previous rate cuts, that doesn't necessarily mean home loan rates will decrease in response. However, they might fall if the Fed indicates that it intends to slash rates more aggressively next year.\n\nLearn more about why mortgage rates didn't decrease after the last fed funds rate cut.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nSee the mortgage lenders with the best rates this week.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nMORE: Read about the best mortgage refinance lenders right now.\n\nYou can use the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator below to play around with how different terms and rates will affect your monthly payment. Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders.\n\nToday’s average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.10%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low.\n\nIf you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 6.10% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,818, and you’d pay $354,474 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.55% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to compound.\n\nHowever, your monthly payments will be higher because you’re squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.55% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,459. But you’d only pay $142,659.\n\nHow much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\n\nWith an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year.\n\nAdjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate goes up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends — that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later.\n\nLately, ARM rates have occasionally been similar to or higher than fixed rates. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nYou can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown is also an option — for example, maybe you get a 6.25% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4.25% for year one, increase to 5.25% for year two, then settle in at 6.25% for the remainder of your term.\n\nJust consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself if you’ll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.\n\nHere are interest rates for some of the most popular mortgage terms: According to Zillow data, the national average 30-year fixed rate is 6.10%, the 15-year fixed rate is 5.55%, and the 5/1 ARM rate is 6.45%.\n\nA normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 6.10%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data. The average might be higher or lower depending on where you live in the U.S.\n\nMortgage rates are not expected to drop significantly before the end of the year, as economists continue to monitor inflation, tariffs, and the Federal Reserve's actions.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nA mortgage refinance involves replacing your original home loan with a new one. Learn how to refinance a mortgage loan and decide if it's the right choice for you.\n\nMortgage rates are down, so refinancing soon could be a good idea. Learn what to know and how to prepare for refinancing your mortgage at the beginning of 2026.\n\nThe Fed once again voted to hold the federal funds rate steady.
