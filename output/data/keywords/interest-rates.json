Still, Silva praised Galipolo, who Lula appointed to lead the bank starting this year.",

    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance rates. People shouldn't necessarily wait until after the Fed meeting to lock in a rate, as rates are likely to hold steady.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates have risen since last week. According to Zillow data, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is up 13 basis points to 6.10%, and the 15-year fixed rate has increased by 14 basis points to 5.55%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will announce whether it is cutting the federal funds rate for a third time this year on Wednesday. Many experts predict that the central bank will lower its rate again — but based on how mortgage rates have reacted to previous rate cuts, that doesn't necessarily mean home loan rates will decrease in response. However, they might fall if the Fed indicates that it intends to slash rates more aggressively next year.\n\nLearn more about why mortgage rates didn't decrease after the last fed funds rate cut.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nSee the mortgage lenders with the best rates this week.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nMORE: Read about the best mortgage refinance lenders right now.\n\nYou can use the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator below to play around with how different terms and rates will affect your monthly payment. Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders.\n\nToday’s average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.10%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low.\n\nIf you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 6.10% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,818, and you’d pay $354,474 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.55% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to compound.\n\nHowever, your monthly payments will be higher because you’re squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.55% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,459. But you’d only pay $142,659.\n\nHow much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\n\nWith an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year.\n\nAdjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate goes up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends — that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later.\n\nLately, ARM rates have occasionally been similar to or higher than fixed rates. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nYou can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown is also an option — for example, maybe you get a 6.25% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4.25% for year one, increase to 5.25% for year two, then settle in at 6.25% for the remainder of your term.\n\nJust consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself if you’ll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.\n\nHere are interest rates for some of the most popular mortgage terms: According to Zillow data, the national average 30-year fixed rate is 6.10%, the 15-year fixed rate is 5.55%, and the 5/1 ARM rate is 6.45%.\n\nA normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 6.10%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data. The average might be higher or lower depending on where you live in the U.S.\n\nMortgage rates are not expected to drop significantly before the end of the year, as economists continue to monitor inflation, tariffs, and the Federal Reserve's actions.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nA mortgage refinance involves replacing your original home loan with a new one. Learn how to refinance a mortgage loan and decide if it's the right choice for you.\n\nMortgage rates are down, so refinancing soon could be a good idea. Learn what to know and how to prepare for refinancing your mortgage at the beginning of 2026.\n\nThe Fed once again voted to hold the federal funds rate steady. Will interest rates begin dropping before the year is up?\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program.

    "description": "The Fed's final meeting of 2025 is expected to see a third interest rate cut from the central bank, with investors focusing on the outlook for 2026.",
    "fullText": "The Federal Reserve's final meeting of the year is set to begin on Tuesday morning, Dec. 9, with the central bank scheduled to announce its final monetary policy decision at 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nInvestors expect the Fed will cut rates by 0.25%, its third cut of the year, at the conclusion of its two-day meeting, with data from the CME Group showing a 90% chance the central bank will cut rates this week.\n\nAlong with its final policy decision of the year, the Fed will also publish its final Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) for 2025, which includes forecasts from Fed officials on economic growth, inflation, and interest rates for the coming years.\n\nIn September, the SEP showed the Fed's median forecasts calling for just one interest rate cut in 2026 following three reductions in 2025. Changes to this outlook will be top of mind for investors on Wednesday.\n\nInvestors will also be closely watching for further disagreement among Fed officials, as October's policy statement revealed two members of the FOMC voted against the decision to lower rates by 0.25%.\n\nThe consensus around the Federal Reserve’s policy move on Wednesday has firmed around a 25 basis point rate cut — even if the decision will be a close one, as Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger details.\n\nTraders are pricing in an 89% chance that the Fed lowers interest rates by 25 basis points at the conclusion of the FOMC meeting on Wednesday, according to CMEGroup's FedWatch.\n\nBut looking ahead to the January meeting and 2026 broadly, the path is even less certain.\n\nOne widely held view is that the Fed will move forward with a \"hawkish cut\" on Wednesday, in which the central bank lowers rates but hints at a pause in January, JPMorgan’s Michael Feroli wrote in a Dec. 5 note. Traders have put a 23% probability that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting rates at its Jan. 27-28 meeting.\n\n“At the press conference, we expect that Powell will stress that with policy rates close to neutral, the time for risk management cuts is past and that further cuts would only come with a material deterioration in the labor market,” Feroli wrote.\n\n\"We don’t expect him to comment directly on January,\" Feroli added, \"but instead to highlight that there is a lot of data to be released between now and the January meeting and that will guide their decision.\"\n\nFor the remainder of the year, views range from the Fed cutting rates at its next few policy meetings due to a deterioration in the labor market to additional rate cuts in the summer due to a change in Fed leadership.\n\nRead more about 2026 predictions for Federal Reserve policy here.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's eventful 2025 wraps up this week, and another 0.25% rate cut is expected.\n\nBut the real drama in the central bank's release will be in how much agreement, or not, there is with this decision.\n\nAs Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger noted in her preview of the event, at least three regional Fed presidents have signaled that the case for cutting rates this week does not appear obvious. One of those includes Kansas City Fed president Jeff Schmid, who voted against October's rate cut.\n\nAdd in that Fed Governor Stephen Miran has twice dissented in favor of a larger rate cut, the central bank could be looking at upward of four votes against the expected decision to lower rates by another 0.25% on Wednesday.\n\nRead Jennifer's full preview of the meeting here.",
