    "fullText": "President Donald Trump knows he's aligning himself with the progressive left when it comes to credit cards.\n\nDuring an interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen in Davos on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that his call for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates isn't a standard conservative policy.\n\nIn fact, he joked that it's something that New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, might have come up with.\n\n\"I know it's sort of like… it sounds like the mayor of New York maybe came up with that,\" Trump said with a laugh.\n\nFollowing Mamdani's election in November, the two met in the Oval Office and appeared to share some common ground in remarks to the press afterwards.\n\n\"I'm conservative, but I think I'm common sense, you know?\" Trump said on Wednesday. \"People say, 'Are you a conservative?' I say, 'Yeah, but I'm a common-sense person.' I mean, I do things that aren't necessarily that conservative sometimes.\"\n\nTrump said he respected credit card companies but that consumers can't afford to pay high rates.\n\n\"Whatever happened to usury? They can't pay 28%,\" Trump said.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Trump called on Congress to pass a bill capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year.\n\nKey Republicans in Congress have been cool to that idea, with House Speaker Mike Johnson telling reporters last week that Trump \"probably had not thought through\" the potential downsides of the policy and that credit card companies may \"just stop lending money\" or \"cap what people are able to borrow at a very low amount.\"\n\nMany business leaders have also been critical of the idea.\n\nYet Trump's call has also been met with agreement from some progressives, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, whom Trump called last week.\n\nIn Congress, Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri have introduced a bill that would do just what Trump said, capping credit card rates at 10% for a year.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump briefly addressed high housing costs and interest rates in his Davos speech but did not get into specifics.",
    "fullText": "After making his case to acquire Greenland, President Donald Trump celebrated his own achievements and elaborated on his plans to address the high cost of housing in the US during his hourlong speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday.\n\n\"Homeownership has always been a symbol of health and vigor of American society, but that goal fell out of reach for millions and millions of people in the Biden era because interest rates went up so high,\" Trump said. \"Today, I'm taking action to bring back this bedrock of the American dream.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's proposals have included banning \"large institutional investors\" from buying single-family homes, purchasing $200 billion of mortgage debt to reduce mortgage interest rates, introducing 50-year mortgages and portable home loans, and allowing homebuyers to use their 401(k)s to make a down payment.\n\n\"In 2024, the US built less than two million new homes,\" Trump said, adding that Biden admitted eight million new migrants. \"Those days are over.\"\n\nBut industry watchers and housing policy researchers say the fundamental driver of high housing costs is a shortage of homes — and there isn't a quick fix. Building enough housing to accommodate demand in markets across the US will take many years and require significant action on the state and local levels.\n\nTrump signed an executive order on Tuesday cracking down on major investors in homes and asked Congress to pass legislation banning \"large institutional investors\" from buying houses.\n\n\"Homes are built for people, not for corporations, and America will not become a nation of renters,\" Trump said in Davos.\n\nMajor investors, including hedge funds and private equity firms, own hundreds of thousands of single-family homes around the US, which has raised concerns that Wall Street-backed groups are outcompeting individual homebuyers, especially first-time buyers, and driving up home prices.\n\nBut these mega landlords own only about 2% of the single-family rental housing stock, according to a 2024 analysis by the GAO. And since 2022, they've slowed their purchasing as interest rates have spiked and home prices have remained high. The evidence isn't particularly strong that big investors charge more than smaller landlords, or that they outcompete other buyers.\n\nJenny Schuetz, vice president of housing at Arnold Ventures, previously told Business Insider that the lack of homes in markets across the country is \"number one, two, and three on the list of problems.\" She called a potential ban \"a red herring\" that \"distracts attention from things that actually could be helpful in improving affordability and increasing supply.\"\n\nIn Truth Social posts earlier this month, Trump announced that he had ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy up to $200 billion in mortgage-backed bonds to drive down mortgage interest rates. Mortgage rates have since fallen. But industry experts said the impact of the move would likely be somewhat short-term and overshadowed by the ongoing housing shortage and moves by the Federal Reserve.\n\nTrump didn't provide further details on a plan at Davos, which was teased last week, that would enable Americans to pull from their 401(k)s to make a down payment on a home.\n\nThe proposal was first announced by Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, on Fox Business last week. \"Suppose that you put 10% down on a home, and then you take 10% of the equity of the home and put it in as an asset in your 401(k). Then your 401(k) will grow over time,\" Hassett told the network.\n\nMona Mahajan, head of investment strategy at Edward Jones, said at the time that the plan may be a good step in the right direction if it gets people thinking about diversifying their asset classes and investing earlier in their careers and home ownership journeys.\n\nUnder current tax code rules, first-time homebuyers have to pay a 10% penalty on withdrawing money before the age of 59 ½ from a 401(k) for a home purchase, with the exception of hardship withdrawals or disability reasons. Over the past few years, Congress has allowed people subject to natural disasters and terminal illnesses to withdraw money from their 401(k)s without penalties.\n\nFor IRAs, they can draw up to $10,000 penalty-free but have to pay income tax.\n\nFinancial experts often discourage people from taking out 401(k) loans for reasons such as a home purchase, as doing so could lead to lost growth opportunities, though workers who do so pay themselves with interest.\n\nIt's unclear whether this plan could have legs in Congress, as it would likely require changes to the tax code.\n\nAnother set of ideas that Trump didn't expand on in Davos involves changes to mortgages themselves.\n\nIn November 2025, Trump and the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Bill Pulte, said the administration was exploring a 50-year mortgage option and ways buyers can lock in low interest rates from older mortgages.\n\nThe idea of a half-century-old mortgage has been widely criticized by housing economists, who argue that while 50-year loans would mean lower monthly payments, they would entail much higher interest costs for homeowners over the life of the loan and a much longer road to building equity.\n\nPulte also said the administration was \"actively evaluating\" so-called portable mortgages. These loans would enable homeowners to take their mortgage interest rate with them to a new property.\n\nHousing economists warn that legalizing portable loans could give homeowners who are lucky enough to have an existing mortgage with a low rate an even bigger advantage over first-time homebuyers and others. The dynamic could also drive home prices up by empowering repeat buyers to spend more.\n\n\"Financing is not the solution,\" Kara Ng, a senior economist at Zillow, previously told Business Insider. \"We're in this affordability crisis because there's a housing shortage, so changing the loan terms, having different financing products — it doesn't change the fact there aren't enough homes to go around.\"",

Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders.\n\nToday’s average 30-year mortgage rate is 5.90%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low.\n\nIf you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 5.90% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,779, and you’d pay $340,587 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.36% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to compound.\n\nHowever, your monthly payments will be higher because you’re squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.36% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,429. But you’d only pay $137,224 in interest over the life of the loan.\n\nHow much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\n\nWith an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year.\n\nAdjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate goes up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends — that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later.\n\nLately, ARM rates have occasionally been similar to or higher than fixed rates. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nYou can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown is also an option — for example, maybe you get a 6.25% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4.25% for year one, increase to 5.25% for year two, then settle in at 6.25% for the remainder of your term.\n\nJust consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself if you’ll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.\n\nHere are interest rates for some of the most popular mortgage terms: According to Zillow data, the national average 30-year fixed rate is 5.90%, the 15-year fixed rate is 5.36%, and the 5/1 ARM rate is 6.11%.\n\nA normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 5.90%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data. Zillow's rates are usually lower than those reported by Freddie Mac and elsewhere. Each source compiles rates using different methods. Zillow gets rates from its lender marketplace, and Freddie Mac pulls information from loan applications submitted to its underwriting system. The average might be higher or lower depending on where you live in the U.S. And of course, your credit score.\n\nNot much. According to its December forecast, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.4% through 2026. Fannie Mae also predicts a 30-year rate above 6% through next year, yet dipping down to 5.9% in Q4 2026.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac already buy mortgage bonds, and Trump wants them to purchase $200 billion in bonds.

But you’d only pay $137,224 in interest over the years.\n\nWith a fixed-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for the entire life of your loan. You will get a new rate if you refinance your mortgage, though.\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for a predetermined period of time. Then, the rate will go up or down depending on several factors, such as the economy and the maximum amount your rate can change according to your contract. For example, with a 7/1 ARM, your rate would be locked in for the first seven years, then change every year for the remaining 23 years of your term.\n\nAdjustable rates typically start lower than fixed rates, but once the initial rate-lock period ends, it’s possible your rate will go up. Lately, though, some fixed rates have been starting lower than adjustable rates. Talk to your lender about its rates before choosing one or the other.\n\nRead more about fixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgages.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, great or excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So, if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nWaiting for rates to drop probably isn’t the best method to get the lowest mortgage rate right now. If you’re ready to buy, focusing on your personal finances is probably the best way to lower your rate.\n\nTo find the best mortgage lender for your situation, apply for mortgage preapproval with three or four companies. Just be sure to apply to all of them within a short time frame — doing so will give you the most accurate comparisons and have less of an impact on your credit score.\n\nWhen choosing a lender, don’t just compare interest rates. Look at the mortgage annual percentage rate (APR) — this factors in the interest rate, any discount points, and fees. The APR, which is also expressed as a percentage, reflects the true annual cost of borrowing money. This is probably the most important number to look at when comparing mortgage lenders.\n\nLearn 6 tips for choosing a mortgage lender.\n\nAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate for purchasing a home is 5.90%, and the average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.36%.

Be sure to use the dropdown to include private mortgage insurance costs and HOA dues if they apply to you. These monthly expenses, along with your mortgage principal and interest rate, will give you a realistic idea of what your monthly payment could be.\n\nA mortgage interest rate is the fee charged by a lender for borrowing money, expressed as a percentage. There are two basic types of mortgage rates: fixed and adjustable rates.\n\nA fixed-rate mortgage locks in your rate for the entire life of your loan. For example, if you get a 30-year mortgage with a 6% interest rate, your rate will remain at 6% for the entire 30 years. (Unless you refinance or sell the home.)\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for the first few years, then changes it periodically. Let’s say you get a 5/1 ARM with an introductory rate of 6%. Your rate would be 6% for the first five years, and then the rate would increase or decrease once per year for the last 25 years of your term. Whether your rate goes up or down depends on several factors, such as the economy and U.S. housing market.\n\nAt the beginning of your mortgage term, most of your monthly payment goes toward interest. As time passes, less of your payment goes toward interest, and more goes toward the mortgage principal or the amount you originally borrowed.\n\nLearn how to choose between an adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage.\n\nTwo categories determine mortgage rates: those you can control and those you cannot.\n\nWhat factors can you control? First, you can compare the best mortgage lenders to find the one that gives you the lowest rate and fees.\n\nSecond, lenders typically extend lower rates to people with higher credit scores, lower debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, and considerable down payments. If you can save more or pay down debt before securing a mortgage, a lender will probably give you a better interest rate.\n\nWhat factors can you not control? In short, the economy.\n\nThe list of ways the economy impacts mortgage rates is long, but here are the basic details. If the economy — for example, employment rates — is struggling, mortgage rates decrease to encourage borrowing, which helps boost the economy. If the economy is strong, mortgage rates go up to temper spending.\n\nWith all other factors being equal, mortgage refinance rates are typically slightly higher than purchase rates. So don't be surprised if your refinance rate is higher than you may have expected.\n\nTwo of the most common mortgage terms are 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages. Both lock in your rate for the entire loan term.\n\nA 30-year mortgage is popular because it has relatively low monthly payments. But it comes with a higher interest rate than shorter terms, and because you’re accumulating interest for three decades, you’ll pay a lot of interest in the long run.\n\nA 15-year mortgage can be a good choice because it has a lower rate than you’ll get with longer terms, so you’ll pay less in interest over the years. You’ll also pay off your mortgage much faster. But your monthly payments will be higher because you’re paying off the same loan amount in half the time.\n\nBasically, 30-year mortgages are more affordable from month to month, while 15-year mortgages are cheaper in the long run.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance's weekly survey of lenders with the lowest rates, some of the banks with the lowest median mortgage rates are Chase and Citibank. However, it's a good idea to shop around for the best rate with not just banks, but also credit unions and companies specializing in mortgage lending.\n\nYes, 2.75% is a fantastic mortgage rate. You're unlikely to get a 2.75% rate in today's market unless you take on an assumable mortgage from a seller who locked in this rate in 2020 or 2021, when rates were at all-time lows.\n\nAccording to Freddie Mac, the lowest-ever 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 2.65%. This was the national average in January 2021. It is extremely unlikely that rates will dip below 3% again anytime soon.\n\nSome experts say it's worth refinancing when you can lock in a rate that's 2% less than your current mortgage rate. Others say 1% is the magic number. It all depends on what your financial goals are when refinancing, and when your break-even point would be after paying refinance closing costs.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nMortgage rates are down, so refinancing soon could be a good idea.

    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates have bounced up from recent lows, but remain under 6%. According to Zillow, the average 30-year fixed rate is 5.93%. Meanwhile, the 15-year fixed home loan rate is 5.40%. Zillow compiles rates from those offered in its lender marketplace.\n\n5.5% and below: See which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nLearn about how mortgage rates are determined.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various interest rates and loan amounts will affect your monthly payments. It also shows how the term length plays into things.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. You even have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues if those apply to you. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThere are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.\n\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.\n\nThe main disadvantage of 30-year fixed mortgage rates is the mortgage interest, both in the short and long term.\n\nA 30-year fixed-term loan comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed-term loan. You’ll also pay much \n\nThe pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are essentially swapped with those of 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.\n\nHowever, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.\n\nDetermine whether to get a 15-year vs. 30-year mortgage.\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined amount of time, then change it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.\n\nThe main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't reflect this, though — fixed rates are actually lower, according to Zillow data. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)\n\nWith an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.\n\nBut if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.\n\nRead about the differences between adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgages.\n\nThe national average 30-year mortgage rate is 5.93% right now, according to Zillow. But keep in mind that averages can vary depending on where you live. For example, if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be higher.\n\nRecently, mortgage rates took a dive when President Trump announced some proposals to enhance home affordability and lower mortgage rates. They have moved slightly above recent lows. However, according to Freddie Mac data, 30-year mortgage rates remain a half-point or more below where they were one year ago.\n\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.\n\nThe best mortgage lenders offer low interest rates, a range of loan programs, and high customer satisfaction.

    "description": "While major banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Citi, warned that a 10% credit card cap would reduce access to credit, some CEOs applaud the plan.",
    "fullText": "Business leaders have mixed reviews of President Donald Trump's new plan for credit cards.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump said on Friday he would call for a one-year cap of 10% on credit card interest rates, arguing that consumers are being \"ripped off\" by rates that he said can be as high as 20% or 30%. Congress, not the president, has the power to implement such a cap. Similar proposals have previously stalled on Capitol Hill.\n\nMajor banks, including JPMorgan Chase, UBS, and Citi, warned that a 10% cap could reduce access to credit; others in the financial sector applauded the plan.\n\nHere is how business leaders have responded so far\n\nKlarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski backs Trump's plan.\n\nSiemiatkowski told CNBC in an interview on Monday that traditional credit cards are built to encourage consumers to put most of their spending on credit, and then carry big balances at steep interest rates. That dynamic, he said, pushes people to borrow more than they should and results in higher losses, especially among lower-income borrowers.\n\n\"I think Trump is wise here and is proposing something that makes a lot of sense,\" Siemiatkowski told CNBC on Monday.\n\n\"Capitalism is great, but anarchy is not,\" Siemiatkowski added regarding consumer protection.\n\nIn another interview with CNN, Siemiatkowski also said that credit card rewards like cash back and airline miles largely benefit wealthier consumers while lower-income cardholders shoulder more of the costs.\n\nJPMorgan's CFO said that Trump's plan could upend the company's business model.\n\n\"It's a very competitive business, but we wouldn't be in it if it weren't a good business for us,\" said Jeremy Barnum during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. \"And in a world where price controls make it no longer a good business, that would present a significant challenge.\"\n\nJPMorgan said on its fourth-quarter earnings call that debit and credit card sales volume rose roughly 7% year over year and described the business as central to its retail-focused offerings.\n\nThe CEO of JPMorgan also weighed in on Trump's credit card proposal.\n\nJamie Dimon told investors on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call that reducing card interest rates could adversely affect customers with lower credit scores by limiting access to credit.\n\n\"If it happened the way it was described, it would be dramatic,\" Dimon said.\n\n\"This is a mistake, President,\" Bill Ackman, the billionaire CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, wrote on Friday on X in a now-deleted post.\n\n\"Without being able to charge rates adequate enough to cover losses and to earn an adequate return on equity, credit card lenders will cancel cards for millions of consumers who will have to turn to loan sharks for credit at rates higher than and on terms inferior to what they previously paid,\" Ackman added.\n\nAckman said in another post on Saturday that although Trump's goal is one that's \"worthy and important,\" the rate cap is not the way to achieve it.\n\n\"The best way to bring down rates would be to make it more competitive by making the regulatory regime more conducive to new entrants and new technologies,\" Ackman wrote.\n\nThe SoFi CEO believes that his business and consumers could stand to benefit from Trump's credit card rate cap.\n\n\"If this is enacted — and that's a big if, though part of me hopes it is — we would likely see a significant contraction in industry credit card lending,\" Anthony Noto wrote in a post on X. \"Credit card issuers simply won't be able to sustain profitability at a 10% rate cap.\"\n\n\"Consumers, however, will still need access to credit. That creates a large void — one that @SoFi personal loans are well positioned to fill,\" Noto added.\n\nNoto also said that personal loans could be an alternative to addressing debt, though that would make underwriting discipline and borrower education \"even more important.\"",

    "title": "Trump's sweeping proposals for credit cards and student debt could be a big deal for other lenders",
    "description": "With Trump's proposed cap on credit card interest rates and new caps on student loans, more Americans might turn to alternative lenders.",
    "fullText": "More Americans might find themselves turning to personal and private loans this year.\n\nProposed changes to the lending market could impact banks and consumers starting this year, particularly in two of the largest areas of consumer debt: credit cards and student loans. Private and personal lending firms could end up big winners if those changes stick.\n\nOn the student debt side, President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation called for new borrowing caps on graduate and professional loans in an attempt to curb excessive borrowing. It also eliminated the Grad and Parent PLUS programs, which allowed parents and graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs.\n\nMore recently, Trump proposed a one-year, 10% cap on credit card interest rates, which he said would prevent credit card companies from \"ripping off\" consumers.\n\nThe changes to student loan borrowing are set to take effect in July, while it's unclear if Trump's credit card proposal will come to fruition, as its most likely path would be through congressional legislation.\n\nSome policy experts and lenders have said that the caps on rates could mean banks reduce credit card offerings, and caps on student loan borrowing could drive consumers to private loans to help fill the gap.\n\nAs the cost of living continues to rise in the US, personal loans, credit card debt, and student debt are already at record highs. While the benefit of a personal loan is that its flexible terms allow it to be used for a wide range of purposes, interest rates vary depending on credit scores, similar to credit cards.\n\nSimilarly, taking on private student loans could also be riskier than federal financing because their interest rates are often variable, meaning the rate could increase or decrease over the loan's lifetime.\n\nA joint statement from several banking associations said that the cap on credit card interest \"would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives\" such as personal and payday loans.\n\nOn Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase's CFO said that if the interest cap were to take effect, it may not be worth it for the bank to be in the credit card business. Similarly, student borrowers without sufficient financing for their programs may turn to private lending.\n\nPersonal lending company SoFi is an example of a company that could benefit from both policies. CEO Anthony Noto wrote in a post on X that, should Trump's credit card cap proposal be implemented, consumers would need access to more credit.\n\n\"That creates a large void—one that @SoFi personal loans are well positioned to fill,\" Noto said.\n\nNoto also said during an August earnings call that the elimination of Grad and Parent PLUS loans could lead to \"further opportunities for in school lending and student loan refinance.\" Private lender Navient's CEO, David Yowan, expressed a similar idea during an earnings call: \"Grad PLUS elimination is a substantial and significant expansion of opportunities that we have with graduate students.\"\n\nA SoFi spokesperson told Business Insider that the company prioritizes affordability, \"and providing members with a more accessible and safer path to financial independence.\"\n\nAn analysis by credit reporting firm TransUnion found that unsecured personal loan balances reached record highs in the third quarter of 2025, totaling $269 billion.\n\nThe accumulation of debt is a concern shared by some policy experts and lawmakers, particularly regarding student loans. In August, Sen. Elizabeth Warren led some of her colleagues in sending letters to the major private student-loan lenders asking for information on how they plan to protect borrowers in anticipation of an influx into the private lending market.\n\n\"Student debt places a tremendous burden on borrowers, their families, their communities, and the U.S. economy, driving employment, spending, and housing decisions that have long-lasting negative impacts on borrowers' financial health,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"Placing a greater share of student loans into the hands of private lenders threatens to make these problems much worse.\"",

    "title": "Trump's big swing at credit card interest rates targets a growing American problem",
    "description": "Americans' debt loads are at record highs, resurfacing a decadeslong debate on how to prevent companies from maximizing profit at consumers' expense.",
    "fullText": "Americans are racking up credit card debt, and it's costing them even more to get rid of it.\n\nIt's a piece of the affordability debate that has caught the attention of both parties.\n\nIn a move that has been pushed for by lawmakers across the aisle, President Donald Trump on January 9 called for a one-year, 10% cap on credit-card interest rates. He wrote in a Truth Social post that he would call for the cap to begin on January 20.\n\n\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration,\" Trump wrote.\n\nThe easiest path for Trump to cap interest rates would be through congressional legislation. While it's unclear if the proposal would make it through Congress and onto the president's desk, given that similar legislation has yet to become law, Sen. Elizabeth Warren signaled she would work with the president on making it happen.\n\nWarren said in a statement that during a Monday call with Trump, she \"told him that Congress can pass legislation to cap credit card rates if he will actually fight for it.\"\n\nHowever, beyond the mechanics of the proposal, the underlying sentiment — that credit card companies have \"ripped off\" consumers by charging excessive interest — is an issue that has plagued the US for decades as debt loads continue to rise.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2025, the most recent period for which data is available, credit card debt reached a record high of $1.23 trillion — a $24 billion increase from the previous quarter and a $67 billion increase from Q3 2024.\n\nTrump promised a 10% credit-card interest rate cap on the campaign trail, and his latest announcement follows recent bipartisan legislation pushing for a similar move.\n\nIn February 2025, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Josh Hawley introduced a bill capping rates at 10% for five years, with the GOP's Hawley saying in a statement at the time that \"working Americans are drowning in record credit card debt while the biggest credit card issuers get richer and richer by hiking their interest rates to the moon.\"\n\nEven as the Federal Reserve has stepped in to broadly lower interest rates, credit card rates have edged down but remained near record highs over the past year. That means that the Americans trying to chip away at their record-high credit card debt are paying more on those outstanding balances.\n\nIt's not a glitch in the system that consumers are getting trapped by high interest rates — it's a feature, consumer protection experts previously told Business Insider. Hidden fees and shady terms can pull consumers in, and they won't realize what they signed up for until it's too late, Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, said.\n\n\"Credit-card companies can get away with charging high rates of interest because consumers aren't necessarily paying attention, and marketing doesn't focus on that,\" Rust said.\n\nAt the same time, as creditors accrue higher debt loads and contend with higher interest rates, an increasing share of loans is simply going unpaid for 30 days or more.\n\nThere's limited legal recourse for consumers. A 1978 Supreme Court decision allowed banks headquartered in states without usury laws — which aim to prevent companies from unfairly enriching themselves at the expense of borrowers — to set their own interest rates without impunity.\n\nOversight over the industry is lacking, especially after the Trump administration moved to gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB conducts oversight of the industry and found, in a 2023 report, that credit-card companies charged consumers over $105 billion in interest in 2022, helping to boost their profit margins from 4.5% in 2019 to 5.9%.\n\nSome credit-card companies took issue with Trump's proposal. A joint statement from the Bank Policy Institute, American Bankers Association, Consumer Bankers Association, Financial Services Forum, and Independent Community Bankers of America said that the \"cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives\" such as personal and payday loans. Banks typically use higher interest rates to compensate for customers who might not be able to pay back their loans.",

According to Zillow data, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.91%, and the 15-year fixed rate is 5.36%.\n\nMORE: Sub-6% rates: See which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nMORE: Read about the best mortgage refinance lenders right now.\n\nYou can use the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator below to play around with how different terms and rates will affect your monthly payment. Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders.\n\nToday’s average 30-year mortgage rate is 5.91%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low.\n\nIf you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 5.91% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,781, and you’d pay $341,279 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.36% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to compound.\n\nHowever, your monthly payments will be higher because you’re squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.36% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,429. But you’d only pay $137,224 in interest over the life of the loan.\n\nHow much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\n\nWith an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year.\n\nAdjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate goes up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends — that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later.\n\nLately, ARM rates have occasionally been similar to or higher than fixed rates. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nYou can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown is also an option — for example, maybe you get a 6.25% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4.25% for year one, increase to 5.25% for year two, then settle in at 6.25% for the remainder of your term.\n\nJust consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself if you’ll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.\n\nHere are interest rates for some of the most popular mortgage terms: According to Zillow data, the national average 30-year fixed rate is 5.91%, the 15-year fixed rate is 5.36%, and the 5/1 ARM rate is 6.17%.\n\nA normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 5.91%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data. Zillow's rates are usually lower than those reported by Freddie Mac and elsewhere. Each source compiles rates using different methods. Zillow gets rates from its lender marketplace, and Freddie Mac pulls information from loan applications submitted to its underwriting system. The average might be higher or lower depending on where you live in the U.S. And of course, your credit score.\n\nNot much. According to its December forecast, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.4% through 2026. Fannie Mae also predicts a 30-year rate above 6% through next year, yet dipping down to 5.9% in Q4 2026.\n\nThe best mortgage lenders offer low interest rates, a range of loan programs, and high customer satisfaction. Choose the best mortgage lender for your needs.\n\nYou can usually refinance your mortgage with the same bank or lender, but you don’t have to. Learn the pros and cons of using the same lender.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nZillow Home Loans isn’t just a marketplace — it’s also a mortgage lender with conventional, FHA, and VA loans, to name a few. Learn more about Zillow as a lender.\n\nA mortgage refinance can cost 2% to 6% of the loan amount.

    "description": "Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo, said rates could move higher as a surge in bond issuance pulls investors from the Treasury market.",
    "fullText": "A top economist has a fresh warning about debt-fueled capex spending in 2026.\n\nTorsten Sløk, the chief economist at Apollo Global Management, flagged expectations that AI hyperscalers will be significant drivers of investment-grade bond issuance this year. In his view, the flood of new bonds into the market as tech companies look to fund their data centers and other infrastructure is bound to put upward pressure on interest rates.\n\nThe issue is that more corporate debt issuance could drag buyers away from other bond markets.\n\n\"The significant increase in hyperscaler issuance raises questions about who will be the marginal buyer of IG paper,\" he wrote. \"Will it come from Treasury purchases and hence put upward pressure on the level of rates? Or might it come from mortgage purchases, putting upward pressure on mortgage spreads?\"\n\nThe economist noted that Wall Street banks can't agree on just how high the borrowing wave will go in 2026, but they all forecast issuance to be high, with analysts eyeing $1.6 trillion to $2.25 trillion of investment-grade bond sales this year.\n\nHowever, for Sløk, the main takeaway is that heavy corporate borrowing could ultimately drive interest rates higher more broadly.\n\n\"The bottom line is that the volume of fixed-income products coming to market this year is significant and is likely to put upward pressure on rates and credit spreads as we go through 2026.\"\n\nSløk said investors should be assessing how the AI buildout, specifically the construction of more data centers and other infrastructure, will be paid for.\n\nCompanies such as Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle collectively issued $100 billion of bonds in 2025. According to Bank of America, that's more than double the amount they raised in the previous year.\n\nSlok isn't the only economist to raise concerns about the broader economic impact of high AI spending. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, recently said that tech borrowing eclipsed levels seen during the dot-com era, adding that if the tech sector's growth stalls, the results could be dire.",

The Fed chair said the subpoenas were the latest move in the Trump administration's pressure campaign on the central bank to lower interest rates.\n\n\"No one — certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve — is above the law,\" Powell said. \"But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.\"\n\nPowell also suggested that this latest threat won't lead to his departure from his position, which President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for. Powell said he would continue to do his job.\n\nThe dollar and US stock futures fell on concerns about the Fed's independence on Sunday. Gold, seen as a haven investment, rose as much as 2%.\n\nFollowing Powell's statement, Trump denied having any knowledge of the Justice Department's investigation into the central bank.\n\n\"I don't know anything about it, but he's certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings,\" Trump said of Powell in an interview with NBC News Sunday night.\n\nThe $2.5 billion planned headquarters renovations have become a major talking point for White House officials, who have accused Powell of overspending and breaking oversight laws.\n\nIn July, Trump said that Powell's actions were \"sort of\" grounds for dismissal but later said he was \"highly unlikely\" to fire Powell, unless it was for \"fraud.\" Powell has defended the renovations.\n\nTrump has urged the Federal Reserve — an independent government agency — to lower interest rates as part of his plan to spur the American economy.\n\nIn its December meeting, the Fed cut rates to a range of 3.5%—3.75%, following similar reductions in September and October. After the meeting, Trump called Fed Chair Jerome Powell \"a stiff\" who approved a \"rather small\" cut and said the cut could have been \"at least doubled.\"\n\nThe president has also targeted Lisa Cook, a Fed governor. In August, he asked her to resign immediately due to allegations that Cook had committed illicit activity related to two mortgage loans. In September, a federal judge ruled that Cook can keep her job at the central bank for now.\n\nThe DOJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

    "fullText": "A significant chunk of Chinese copper demand has all but evaporated after the metal’s stunning surge to record levels.\n\nCopper on the London Metal Exchange burst through $13,000 a ton for the first time this week, extending its rally to nearly 50% over the past year. A cocktail of bullish factors could drive prices even higher over the short term. While real-world buyers typically take time to adjust to such sharp increases, what’s notable in this case is the extent to which industrial users in the biggest market are scaling back purchases.\n\nNYC Fights Sale of Bankrupt Rentals After Mamdani Blasts Living Conditions\n\nNew Design Plans Revealed for White House Ballroom\n\nWe Still Don’t Know if Robotaxis Are Safer Than Human Drivers\n\nNew LA Home Designs, Reimagined By Fire\n\nSlowing the Spread of Urban Fires Starts Right Outside the Home\n\n“It is surprising how much price rejection is taking place. The Chinese are just not buying copper, it’s true,” Kostas Bintas, head of metals at trading giant Mercuria Energy Group Ltd., said in an interview. “But it’s finite — at some point you need to buy.”\n\nSluggish physical demand contrasts with the speculative frenzy lifting futures markets, where deep-pocketed funds are responding to tighter global supply, favorable interest rates and an impulse to hedge geopolitical turmoil by stockpiling commodities. The copper contract in Shanghai, which accounts for import costs, topped 100,000 yuan a ton ($14,300) for the first time at the end of December.\n\nChinese industry, though, accounts for half of global copper demand. The fabricators that shape the metal — into wires, sheets and pipes for power cables, circuit boards and plumbing systems — are struggling to pass on their higher costs to factories. As inventories build, the smelters that refine copper in the first instance are trying to export their surplus.\n\nRecord copper prices “had a significant impact in December,” said Hai Jianxun, a sales executive at Henan Yuxing Copper Co. in central China, which makes pipes for items like air-conditioners. “The overall market was very quiet — much quieter than in previous years.”\n\nA Mysteel Global survey covering most suppliers showed that about 60% of the firms making copper rod for electricity transmission, a category that accounts for around half of China’s copper goods, cut or shut production over the month because of mounting costs.\n\nFees to process refined copper into rod fell to zero this week, Mysteel said, the lowest-ever level for the time of the year.\n\nThe subdued activity isn’t an anomaly. Even during the autumn, when demand typically peaks, operating rates across fabricators were at multiyear lows for the season. Ultimately, the market is paying the price of the economy’s lackluster recovery from the pandemic and structurally weaker growth.",

    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance interest rates, which are testing 6% lows. Shop multiple lenders and lock in your best mortgage rate today.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates remain in the low 6% range. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate for the week is 6.16%, up one basis point. The 15-year fixed rate weekly average was 5.46%, up two basis points. For weeks, home loan interest rates have been making only fractional moves, but remember, mortgage rates vary by location, even by state.\n\nSee which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nHere are 8 strategies for getting the lowest mortgage rate possible.\n\nHere are today's mortgage refinance interest rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAs with mortgage rates for purchase, these are national averages that we've rounded to the nearest hundredth. Refinance rates can be higher than purchase mortgage rates, but that isn't always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage rates will impact your monthly payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. Be sure to use the dropdown to include private mortgage insurance costs and HOA dues if they apply to you. These monthly expenses, along with your mortgage principal and interest rate, will give you a realistic idea of what your monthly payment could be.\n\nA mortgage interest rate is the fee charged by a lender for borrowing money, expressed as a percentage. There are two basic types of mortgage rates: fixed and adjustable rates.\n\nA fixed-rate mortgage locks in your rate for the entire life of your loan. For example, if you get a 30-year mortgage with a 6% interest rate, your rate will remain at 6% for the entire 30 years. (Unless you refinance or sell the home.)\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for the first few years, then changes it periodically. Let’s say you get a 5/1 ARM with an introductory rate of 6%. Your rate would be 6% for the first five years, and then the rate would increase or decrease once per year for the last 25 years of your term. Whether your rate goes up or down depends on several factors, such as the economy and U.S. housing market.\n\nAt the beginning of your mortgage term, most of your monthly payment goes toward interest. As time passes, less of your payment goes toward interest, and more goes toward the mortgage principal or the amount you originally borrowed.\n\nLearn how to choose between an adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage.\n\nTwo categories determine mortgage rates: those you can control and those you cannot.\n\nWhat factors can you control? First, you can compare the best mortgage lenders to find the one that gives you the lowest rate and fees.\n\nSecond, lenders typically extend lower rates to people with higher credit scores, lower debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, and considerable down payments. If you can save more or pay down debt before securing a mortgage, a lender will probably give you a better interest rate.\n\nWhat factors can you not control? In short, the economy.\n\nThe list of ways the economy impacts mortgage rates is long, but here are the basic details. If the economy — for example, employment rates — is struggling, mortgage rates decrease to encourage borrowing, which helps boost the economy. If the economy is strong, mortgage rates go up to temper spending.\n\nWith all other factors being equal, mortgage refinance rates are typically slightly higher than purchase rates. So don't be surprised if your refinance rate is higher than you may have expected.\n\nTwo of the most common mortgage terms are 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages. Both lock in your rate for the entire loan term.\n\nA 30-year mortgage is popular because it has relatively low monthly payments. But it comes with a higher interest rate than shorter terms, and because you’re accumulating interest for three decades, you’ll pay a lot of interest in the long run.\n\nA 15-year mortgage can be a good choice because it has a lower rate than you’ll get with longer terms, so you’ll pay less in interest over the years. You’ll also pay off your mortgage much faster. But your monthly payments will be higher because you’re paying off the same loan amount in half the time.\n\nBasically, 30-year mortgages are more affordable from month to month, while 15-year mortgages are cheaper in the long run.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance's weekly survey of lenders with the lowest rates, some of the banks with the lowest median mortgage rates are Chase and Citibank. However, it's a good idea to shop around for the best rate with not just banks, but also credit unions and companies specializing in mortgage lending.\n\nYes, 2.75% is a fantastic mortgage rate. You're unlikely to get a 2.75% rate in today's market unless you take on an assumable mortgage from a seller who locked in this rate in 2020 or 2021, when rates were at all-time lows.\n\nAccording to Freddie Mac, the lowest-ever 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 2.65%. This was the national average in January 2021. It is extremely unlikely that rates will dip below 3% again anytime soon.\n\nSome experts say it's worth refinancing when you can lock in a rate that's 2% less than your current mortgage rate. Others say 1% is the magic number. It all depends on what your financial goals are when refinancing, and when your break-even point would be after paying refinance closing costs.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nA mortgage refinance can cost 2% to 6% of the loan amount.

    "description": "Trump said Thursday that he is instructing \"representatives\" to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, aiming to lower interest rates and monthly payments.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said Thursday that he is instructing \"representatives\" to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, arguing the move would lower interest rates and monthly housing payments.\n\nIn a Truth Social post, Trump said the directive was possible because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have \"$200 billion in cash.\" He added the bond purchases would help \"make the cost of owning a home more affordable.\"\n\nIt was not clear who Trump meant by his \"representatives,\" or which entity would carry out the purchases. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.\n\nTrump's proposal for his representatives to buy housing bonds comes on the heels of a Wednesday statement made by the president, in which he said he would ban \"large institutional investors\" from buying single-family homes in the US.\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that many housing economists say such a ban would do little to improve national housing affordability. It is unclear what effect Trump's latest proposal would have on the market.\n\nRichard Green, director and chair of the USC Lusk Center for Real Estate, told Business Insider that Trump's proposal doesn't go far enough to solve the fundamental problem with American housing, which is that there simply aren't enough homes for each person who wants to buy one.\n\nHowever, he added, even the $200 billion proposal is more symbolic than substantive.\n\n\"When the Fed was involved in buying mortgages, they were buying trillions, right? So this is a gesture, I suppose,\" Green said. \"And of course, if you drop interest rates down, it will show up at higher house prices, which means that down payment becomes more difficult.\"\n\n\"So it's not like magic, that if you push down mortgage interest rates, that you're going to make housing less or more affordable,\" Green added. \"But the big thing is that $200 billion sounds like a big number, but in context, it's not all that much.\"\n\nTrump's plan also came just a day after he signed an executive order that bans defense contractors from stock buybacks and dividends unless they meet certain standards.\n\nThe approach fits with a broader shift in Trump's second-term economic playbook, as previously reported by Business Insider's Emily Stewart. The Trump administration seems to have embraced a more interventionist style of capitalism, with the federal government taking a more active role in markets, including holding direct stakes in private companies.\n\nTrump's latest rhetoric also appears to target the affordability crisis as frustration over prices builds and as midterm elections near.\n\nHousing, food, and everyday expenses remain stubbornly expensive since Trump took office for the second time, and his tariffs did not help. Zohran Mamdani, the new mayor of NYC, who had a meeting with Trump, notably won by running on universal childcare and affordable housing. According to a poll by Lake Research Partners in October 2025, support for affordability and living-wage policies in competitive swing districts is high and would give candidates who run on economic issues an advantage.",

Meanwhile, the 15-year fixed home loan rate is up four basis points to 5.45%.

You even have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues if those apply to you. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThere are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.\n\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.\n\nThe main disadvantage of 30-year fixed mortgage rates is the mortgage interest, both in the short and long term.\n\nA 30-year fixed-term loan comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed-term loan. You’ll also pay much \n\nThe pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are essentially swapped with those of 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.\n\nHowever, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.\n\nDetermine whether to get a 15-year vs. 30-year mortgage.\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined amount of time, then change it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.\n\nThe main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't reflect this, though — fixed rates are actually lower, according to Zillow data. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)\n\nWith an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.\n\nBut if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.\n\nRead about the differences between adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgages.\n\nThe national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.01% right now, according to Zillow. But keep in mind that averages can vary depending on where you live. For example, if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be higher.\n\nEconomists don't expect drastic mortgage rate drops before the end of 2026. Even with the last cut to the federal funds rate in December, mortgage rates continue to hover within a range — barely moving since mid-October.\n\nRecently, mortgage rates have been stuck in a rut — but there was a general move lower over the past couple of months. According to Freddie Mac data, 30-year mortgage rates remain about a half-point below where they were one year ago.\n\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity.

Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders.\n\nToday’s average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.01%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low.\n\nIf you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 6.01% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,800, and you’d pay $348,209 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.44% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to compound.\n\nHowever, your monthly payments will be higher because you’re squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.44% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,442. But you’d only pay $139,508 in interest over the life of the loan.\n\nHow much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\n\nWith an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year.\n\nAdjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate goes up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends — that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later.\n\nLately, ARM rates have occasionally been similar to or higher than fixed rates. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nYou can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown is also an option — for example, maybe you get a 6.25% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4.25% for year one, increase to 5.25% for year two, then settle in at 6.25% for the remainder of your term.\n\nJust consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself if you’ll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.\n\nHere are interest rates for some of the most popular mortgage terms: According to Zillow data, the national average 30-year fixed rate is 6.01%, the 15-year fixed rate is 5.44%, and the 5/1 ARM rate is 6.23%.\n\nA normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 6.01%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data. The average might be higher or lower depending on where you live in the U.S. And of course, your credit score.\n\nNot much. According to its December forecast, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.4% through 2026.

If you’re ready to buy, focusing on your personal finances is probably the best way to lower your rate.\n\nTo find the best mortgage lender for your situation, apply for mortgage preapproval with three or four companies. Just be sure to apply to all of them within a short time frame — doing so will give you the most accurate comparisons and have less of an impact on your credit score.\n\nWhen choosing a lender, don’t just compare interest rates. Look at the mortgage annual percentage rate (APR) — this factors in the interest rate, any discount points, and fees. The APR, which is also expressed as a percentage, reflects the true annual cost of borrowing money.

So, if you want or need to buy a house soon, you should feel pretty good about the current housing market.\n\nThe best time to buy is typically whenever it makes sense for your stage of life. Trying to time the real estate market can be as futile as timing the stock market — buy when it's the right time for you.\n\nWhich is more important, your home price or mortgage rate?\n\nAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.01% right now. Why are Zillow's rates usually lower than those reported by Freddie Mac and elsewhere? Each source compiles rates by different methods. Zillow gets rates from its lender marketplace and Freddie Mac pulls information from loan applications submitted to its underwriting system. Mortgage rates vary by state and even ZIP code, by lender, loan type, and many other factors. That's why it's so important to shop multiple mortgage lenders.\n\nAre interest rates expected to go down?\n\nNot much. According to its December forecast, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.4% through 2026. Fannie Mae also predicts a 30-year rate above 6% through next year, yet dipping down to 5.9% in Q4 2026.\n\nOverall, mortgage rates have dropped gradually since the end of May. The 30-year fixed rate topped out over 7% in January, then bounced higher and lower for months. On May 29, the 30-year rate was 6.89%, and began slowly moving down.\n\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nThe best mortgage refinance companies charge low interest rates and fees, and they often have unique perks for customers. Find your best mortgage refinance lender.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nMortgage rates are down, so refinancing soon could be a good idea. Learn what to know and how to prepare for refinancing your mortgage at the beginning of 2026.\n\nA mortgage refinance can cost 2% to 6% of the loan amount. Learn what impacts these costs and how to lower or eliminate what you pay up front.\n\nChase Home Loans is offering a \"refinancing rate sale\" for rate-and-term and cash-out refinancing.

    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates continue drifting with small changes. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate this week is down three basis points to 6.18%. The 15-year fixed rate is up three basis points for the week to 5.50%.\n\n“The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage decreased further this week,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist. “Declining rates offer a timely and welcome gift for aspiring homebuyers.”\n\nSee which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week, Dec. 22-26, 2025.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nHere are 8 strategies for getting the lowest mortgage rate possible.\n\nHere are today's mortgage refinance interest rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAs with mortgage rates for purchase, these are national averages that we've rounded to the nearest hundredth. Refinance rates can be higher than purchase mortgage rates, but that isn't always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage rates will impact your monthly payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. Be sure to use the dropdown to include private mortgage insurance costs and HOA dues if they apply to you. These monthly expenses, along with your mortgage principal and interest rate, will give you a realistic idea of what your monthly payment could be.\n\nA mortgage interest rate is the fee charged by a lender for borrowing money, expressed as a percentage. There are two basic types of mortgage rates: fixed and adjustable rates.\n\nA fixed-rate mortgage locks in your rate for the entire life of your loan. For example, if you get a 30-year mortgage with a 6% interest rate, your rate will remain at 6% for the entire 30 years. (Unless you refinance or sell the home.)\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for the first few years, then changes it periodically. Let’s say you get a 5/1 ARM with an introductory rate of 6%. Your rate would be 6% for the first five years, and then the rate would increase or decrease once per year for the last 25 years of your term. Whether your rate goes up or down depends on several factors, such as the economy and U.S. housing market.\n\nAt the beginning of your mortgage term, most of your monthly payment goes toward interest. As time passes, less of your payment goes toward interest, and more goes toward the mortgage principal or the amount you originally borrowed.\n\nLearn how to choose between an adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage.\n\nTwo categories determine mortgage rates: those you can control and those you cannot.\n\nWhat factors can you control? First, you can compare the best mortgage lenders to find the one that gives you the lowest rate and fees.\n\nSecond, lenders typically extend lower rates to people with higher credit scores, lower debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, and considerable down payments. If you can save more or pay down debt before securing a mortgage, a lender will probably give you a better interest rate.\n\nWhat factors can you not control? In short, the economy.\n\nThe list of ways the economy impacts mortgage rates is long, but here are the basic details. If the economy — for example, employment rates — is struggling, mortgage rates decrease to encourage borrowing, which helps boost the economy. If the economy is strong, mortgage rates go up to temper spending.\n\nWith all other factors being equal, mortgage refinance rates are typically slightly higher than purchase rates. So don't be surprised if your refinance rate is higher than you may have expected.\n\nTwo of the most common mortgage terms are 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages. Both lock in your rate for the entire loan term.\n\nA 30-year mortgage is popular because it has relatively low monthly payments. But it comes with a higher interest rate than shorter terms, and because you’re accumulating interest for three decades, you’ll pay a lot of interest in the long run.\n\nA 15-year mortgage can be a good choice because it has a lower rate than you’ll get with longer terms, so you’ll pay less in interest over the years. You’ll also pay off your mortgage much faster. But your monthly payments will be higher because you’re paying off the same loan amount in half the time.\n\nBasically, 30-year mortgages are more affordable from month to month, while 15-year mortgages are cheaper in the long run.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance's weekly survey of lenders with the lowest rates, some of the banks with the lowest median mortgage rates are Chase and Citibank. However, it's a good idea to shop around for the best rate with not just banks, but also credit unions and companies specializing in mortgage lending.\n\nYes, 2.75% is a fantastic mortgage rate. You're unlikely to get a 2.75% rate in today's market unless you take on an assumable mortgage from a seller who locked in this rate in 2020 or 2021, when rates were at all-time lows.\n\nAccording to Freddie Mac, the lowest-ever 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 2.65%. This was the national average in January 2021. It is extremely unlikely that rates will dip below 3% again anytime soon.\n\nSome experts say it's worth refinancing when you can lock in a rate that's 2% less than your current mortgage rate. Others say 1% is the magic number. It all depends on what your financial goals are when refinancing, and when your break-even point would be after paying refinance closing costs.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck.

Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders.\n\nToday’s average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.03%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low.\n\nIf you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 6.03% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,804, and you’d pay $349,599 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.42% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to compound.\n\nHowever, your monthly payments will be higher because you’re squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.42% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,439. But you’d only pay $138,936 in interest over the life of the loan.\n\nHow much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\n\nWith an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year.\n\nAdjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate goes up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends — that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later.\n\nLately, ARM rates have occasionally been similar to or higher than fixed rates. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nYou can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown is also an option — for example, maybe you get a 6.25% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4.25% for year one, increase to 5.25% for year two, then settle in at 6.25% for the remainder of your term.\n\nJust consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself if you’ll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.\n\nHere are interest rates for some of the most popular mortgage terms: According to Zillow data, the national average 30-year fixed rate is 6.03%, the 15-year fixed rate is 5.42%, and the 5/1 ARM rate is 6.03%.\n\nA normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 6.03%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data. The average might be higher or lower depending on where you live in the U.S. And of course, your credit score.\n\nNot much. According to its November forecast, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.4% through 2026.

This gives you a more realistic idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThe average 30-year mortgage rate today is 6.03%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is lower than with a shorter-term loan.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.42% today. When deciding between a 15-year and a 30-year mortgage, consider your short-term versus long-term goals.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to accumulate. But the trade-off is that your monthly payment will be higher as you pay off the same amount in half the time.\n\nLet’s say you get a $300,000 mortgage. With a 30-year term and a 6.03% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,804, and you’d pay $349,599 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.42% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,439. But you’d only pay $138,936 in interest over the years.\n\nWith a fixed-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for the entire life of your loan. You will get a new rate if you refinance your mortgage, though.\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for a predetermined period of time. Then, the rate will go up or down depending on several factors, such as the economy and the maximum amount your rate can change according to your contract. For example, with a 7/1 ARM, your rate would be locked in for the first seven years, then change every year for the remaining 23 years of your term.\n\nAdjustable rates typically start lower than fixed rates, but once the initial rate-lock period ends, it’s possible your rate will go up. Lately, though, some fixed rates have been starting lower than adjustable rates. Talk to your lender about its rates before choosing one or the other.\n\nRead more about fixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgages.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, great or excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So, if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nWaiting for rates to drop probably isn’t the best method to get the lowest mortgage rate right now. If you’re ready to buy, focusing on your personal finances is probably the best way to lower your rate.\n\nTo find the best mortgage lender for your situation, apply for mortgage preapproval with three or four companies. Just be sure to apply to all of them within a short time frame — doing so will give you the most accurate comparisons and have less of an impact on your credit score.\n\nWhen choosing a lender, don’t just compare interest rates. Look at the mortgage annual percentage rate (APR) — this factors in the interest rate, any discount points, and fees. The APR, which is also expressed as a percentage, reflects the true annual cost of borrowing money. This is probably the most important number to look at when comparing mortgage lenders.\n\nLearn 6 tips for choosing a mortgage lender.\n\nAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate for purchasing a home is 6.03%, and the average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.42%. But these are national averages, so the average in your area could be different. Averages are typically higher in expensive parts of the U.S. and lower in less expensive areas.\n\nThe average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.03% right now, according to Zillow. However, you might get an even better rate with an excellent credit score, sizable down payment, and low debt-to-income ratio (DTI).\n\nEconomists don't expect drastic mortgage rate drops before the end of 2026. Even with the recent cut to the federal funds rate, mortgage rates continue to hover within a range — barely moving since mid-October.\n\nThe best mortgage lenders offer low interest rates, a range of loan programs, and high customer satisfaction. Choose the best mortgage lender for your needs.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nYou can usually refinance your mortgage with the same bank or lender, but you don’t have to. Learn the pros and cons of using the same lender.\n\nYou can get a low-cost refinance by shopping for mortgage lenders or boosting your credit score. Learn how to lower your refi costs, both at closing and long term.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nA mortgage refinance can cost 2% to 6% of the loan amount. Learn what impacts these costs and how to lower or eliminate what you pay up front.",

    "description": "Look at the data and charts of the UK's historic interest rates since 1694 and learn about its economic history.",
    "fullText": "Lets look at a history of interest rates in the UK (or England…)\n\nInterest rates in England began in 1694. The government needed to raise money to rebuild the Royal Navy in the Nine Years’ War. It set up an entity called “The Bank” and asked it for a loan of £1.2 million.\n\nThis is how the Bank of England was formed.\n\n(The loan was finally paid off in 1994).\n\nIn over 300 years of UK interest rates and economic history, we can see rates have been high, and rates have been low. (Though the lowest has been in recent memory)\n\nBut lets zoom to our era of economic history.\n\nIt is the turn of the milennium, Britpop is at its height, fears of the Y2K bug didn’t come true, and the dot com bubble finally bursts.\n\nBecause of concerns of a UK economic slowdown, the Bank of England’s (BoE) Monetary Policy Committee lowers interest rates\n\nA hop, skip, and a jump to 2007. Steve Jobs unveils the iPhone, The Spice Girls re-unite for a tour, and we all start yelling “THIS IS SPARTA!” after watching 300.\n\nAlso, there is the foreshadowing of a financial crash. House foreclosures begin in the US, and there is a tightening of household credit in the UK.\n\nThen the unimaginable happens on 15 September 2008. After a radical devaluation of its assets, Lehman Brothers, a 150 year old investment bank goes bust. The US govt refuses to bail it out.\n\nThe US Treasury believes the effects will be contained…\n\nA special Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting is called.\n\nThe UK govt co-ordinates with other G8 countries, and drastically drops rates. A program of quantitative easing begins. Most people (including me) still don’t fully understand what that is.\n\nFrom 2009 we have our era of low interest rates and quantitative easing. Or “cheap money”.\n\nOther features include UK (and Europe) austerity; a Euro sovereign debt crisis; and a tech boom in the US.\n\nBrexit – 23 June 2016. No need to say more.\n\nIn the aftermath of Brexit, The BoE introduces a slew of measures to cushion the UK economy after fluctuations in Sterling. Mark Carney makes economists sexy again after he says the “British economy is serene” to the Treasury Select Committee.\n\nThe BoE cuts rates and introduces further policy measures to prop up the economy during lockdown.\n\nOctober 2021 – Inflation breaks the 2% target and reaches 3%. The first time since 2012.\n\nDecember 2021. The BoE raises rates for the first time since Covid. Inflation is at 4.8%.\n\nThe story starts to ramp up here…\n\n24 February 2022 – Russia invades Ukraine. Global commodity prices such as energy and food sharply rise. The Bank of England raises rates in March 2022.\n\nIn a twist of irony, the BoE meets on the 21st September 2022 and raises rates, because of the two inflationary tailwinds: a demand shock, and energy prices.\n\nIronic, because two days later, Kwasi Kwarteng unveils his “growth plan” (or what I call a piece of economic kamikaze).borrowing a lot of money to enable “growth” in the UK economy.\n\nThe plan is simple. Cut taxes with no plan to balance the books.\n\nWhere will the govt get money to pay for stuff? Why well they’ll borrow the money in the short term, and future growth will balance things out.\n\nWhat kind of growth you ask? Oh. That’s not their business. No need to have a plan for that. Growth will come.\n\nThe, uh, markets have something to say about the “growth plan” (or mini budget).\n\nMortgage rates spike as UK gilts (UK treasury bonds) rise drastically in price. The Bank of England raises rates, as while energy prices have stabilised, UK asset prices have risen due to “UK specific factors”.\n\nThe most understated economic commentary I’ve ever heard.\n\nInflation starts to slow (10.1% to 8.7%)\n\nBut wages are heating up – rising beyond forecasts.\n\nFearing a wage-price spiral, the BoE raises rates by 0.5%.\n\n21 September 2023, mortgage holders and the entire country breathes a small sigh of relief.\n\nFor the first time since December 2021, when the MPC meet, they they do not raise rates.\n\nThey maintain the previous rate of 5.25%.\n\nWith a GDP contraction, and a loosening of the labour market, the signs of high rates are working. However, the economy is now cooling. The goal is to get a “soft landing”.\n\nCool down inflation, which means cooling the economy a bit, but don’t trigger a recession or high unemployment.\n\n9 May 2024. The BoE continues to maintain rates. Inflation is down to 3.2% and is projected to be near its target in the next couple of years. However, fearing persistent inflation, the BoE doesn’t lower rates.\n\n1 August 2024, the country breathes a deeper sigh of relief.\n\nInterest rates are lowered for the first time since the cost of living crisis began.\n\n18 December 2025 – with inflation being 0.2% below forecasts, and continuing to fall, and unemployment ticking up to 5.1%, the Bank of England continues its gradual decrease of interest rates, lowering rates to 3.75%\n\nInterest rates provide a fascinating window on economic history.\n\nIn our little window of time, interest rates play a big role in managing inflation, ensuring prices don’t rise out of control, and the economy keeps ticking.\n\nThe goal is for inflation to be kept at 2% to 2.5%. Where interest rates go will depend on economic matters inside the country\n\nAnd geopolitical events outside the country.\n\nWhatever happens… UK economic history will continue to be written with interest rates.\n\nYou can read a more in-depth history of interest rates from 2000 here.\n\nI can’t guess that, but I can let you know when next they’re updated with my data journalism newsletter. \n\nSign-up form not appearing above?

    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates are holding mostly steady for yet another week. According to Zillow, the average 30-year fixed rate is up one basis point to 6.09%. The 15-year fixed home loan rate is down six basis points to 5.52%. The stability of mortgage rates over the past several weeks is welcomed by borrowers looking to lock in a rate.\n\nSee which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week, Dec. 15, 2025.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nLearn about how mortgage rates are determined.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various interest rates and loan amounts will affect your monthly payments. It also shows how the term length plays into things.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. You even have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues if those apply to you. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThere are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.\n\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.\n\nThe main disadvantage of 30-year fixed mortgage rates is the mortgage interest, both in the short and long term.\n\nA 30-year fixed-term loan comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed-term loan. You’ll also pay much \n\nThe pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are essentially swapped with those of 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.\n\nHowever, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.\n\nDetermine whether to get a 15-year vs. 30-year mortgage.\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined amount of time, then change it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.\n\nThe main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't reflect this, though — fixed rates are actually lower, according to Zillow data. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)\n\nWith an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.\n\nBut if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.\n\nRead about the differences between adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgages.\n\nThe national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.09% right now, according to Zillow. But keep in mind that averages can vary depending on where you live. For example, if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be even higher.\n\nEconomists don't expect drastic mortgage rate drops before the end of 2026. Even with the most recent cut to the federal funds rate, mortgage rates continue to hover within a range — barely moving since mid-October. The Fed is currently signaling a single rate cut for 2026, with perhaps one more in 2027.\n\nRecently, mortgage rates have been hovering in a range — but there has been a general move lower over the past couple of months. According to Freddie Mac data, they remain about a half-point below where they were one year ago.\n\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.\n\nChase Home Loans is offering a \"refinancing rate sale\" for rate-and-term and cash-out refinancing.

Long-term unemployment has been trending upward, and the share of Americans looking for work recently eclipsed the number of available roles. Alongside a steady drum of layoff headlines, unemployment ticked up more than expected last month to 4.6%. Young people are having trouble breaking in, older workers are hesitant to retire, and with the \"flattening\" of many companies, the middle rungs of the career ladder are crumbling. Only healthcare and construction showed substantial growth. It's been called the white-collar recession, an unwelcome awakening for Americans who hoped their college degree would translate to long-term stability and a comfortable salary.\n\nGiven the timing, it's easy to villainize artificial intelligence. C-Suite leaders across industries have said they're \"all in on AI,\" often to the dismay of rank-and-file employees. The tech is quickly reshaping how workers are assessed on the job and how companies define productivity. It's even shaking up the hiring process: My colleagues have talked to job seekers who submitted hundreds of résumés without landing a role, as HR departments are swamped by AI-assisted applications. Economists and investors can't agree if chatbots are the future of the workforce or a vastly overblown bubble.\n\nBut, in shouldering the blame for America's job market woes, AI has become a scapegoat for something else: The economy itself is deteriorating. Years of higher interest rates and stubborn inflation, along with slowing wage growth and restrictive trade policies, have created an environment where businesses are slashing budgets and the middle class is living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nIf you're frustrated by a lower-than-expected raise or the inability to land a new gig, don't blame the robots. Blame Jerome Powell.\n\nThere is no better example of the AI-is-wrecking-the-job-market fears than the so-called \"Scariest Chart in the World.\" The chart has popped up in X and Bluesky posts, news reports, and a thick stack of Substack newsletters. The simple, two-line chart tracks two pieces of data: the S&P 500 and the number of US job vacancies since 2015. The two run closely together for the first couple of years, but there is a decided break in 2022 — the stock market continues to soar, and the number of available jobs begins to decline. AI doomers are quick to point out that the date those two lines diverged corresponds to the public launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT. The implication being that the explosion of large language models immediately began replacing thousands of jobs while pouring money into Wall Street.\n\nAs chatbots and AI tools make employees more productive — drafting emails, writing code, and streamlining administrative tasks — and employers more profitable, the thinking goes, there will be less need for hiring human workers. There's plenty of anecdotal evidence from high-profile companies to support the idea. Nvidia wants employees to use AI \"for every task possible,\" Microsoft is \"rethinking\" its business model for the AI age, Big Law is hoping AI can make its services faster and cheaper, and top banks and consulting firms are transferring some tasks from people to bots.\n\nBut is AI already replacing a bunch of jobs? Probably not.\n\nAjilore thinks the AI-sparked white collar downturn is \"overblown.\" Many companies are \"using AI as a cheat code as opposed to something that makes them more efficient,\" he said, \"With the cheat code, you actually end up making mistakes and cutting corners.\" He believes that both chatbots and Corporate America's tech strategy have a long way to go before AI truly disrupts the workforce.\n\nEven Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the most powerful economic policymaker in the world, isn't sold on AI's effects on the current job market. When asked about the technology during the Fed's December meeting, Powell said AI \"is part of the story, but it's not a big part of the story yet.\"\n\nThere's also an important piece of context missing from \"The Scariest Chart in the World\": the federal funds rate. Decided eight times a year by Powell and his colleagues on the all-important (and dully-named) Federal Open Markets Committee, the Fed funds rate is the key interest rate that anchors all types of loans. For banks and businesses, the number determines how easily and cheaply they can borrow money. For consumers, Fed rates impact everything from home prices to auto loans and credit card rates.\n\nWhen interest rates are low, businesses can access debt more affordably, which helps them fuel growth and hiring. As the fed fund rate increases, however, the price of borrowing rises too. This can help keep inflation in check, but higher rates make it more expensive for companies to operate, meaning that many are seeking other areas to cut costs — often at the expense of employees.\n\nIt's true that the S&P 500 and job openings began to diverge right as ChatGPT launched, but that's also when interest rates started to climb. Between early 2022 and late 2024, federal funds jumped by over 5 percentage points. This was a reshaping of monetary strategy meant to curb soaring prices and cool off a too-hot economy, and it was a major break with nearly a generation of previous policy. The Fed originally slashed interest rates to zero in 2008 to address the fallout from the financial crisis, and in the following 12 years, the benchmark interest rate never rose above 2.4%. Following the emergency measures of the early pandemic, the dramatic hikes of 2022 were a sign that the zero-interest-rate era of the 2010s had officially come to an end.\n\nThis sudden interest rate rise was a turning point many businesses. «tweaked the wording here since it was similar to a sentence in the graf above Hiring boomed in the early pandemic: Job openings skyrocketed to record highs as tech and business fields scrambled to snap up new talent. The Beige Book — a collection of quotes and insights gathered from business owners across the country by the various regional Federal Reserve banks — provides a valuable window into the thinking of hiring managers and executives during this period. Labor market commentary across 2021 and 2022 Beige Books tend to reference \"modest to strong\" job growth, robust hiring demand, and a shortage of workers, with very few mentions of interest rates. This changed when the Fed started hiking rates. One note in the November 2022 edition of the Beige Book said that \"Interest rates and inflation continued to weigh on activity,\" another said \"labor demand weakened overall,\" pointing to layoffs in tech, finance, and real estate. Both blue-collar and white-collar sectors felt the brunt of interest rates that year, citing steep borrowing costs as a central reason they're not hiring. Americans, meanwhile, stopped quitting their jobs as vacancies dried up, and the job market saw its biggest layoff spike since the 2020 shutdown.\n\nCorporate America began to lean into \"efficiency\" rhetoric alongside rising rates. Reduced bureaucracy and red tape, along with a smaller workforce, were sold by the C-Suite as a profit panacea in the face of higher financing costs. Leaders at Meta, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and others spoke about hiring freezes and job cuts as a productivity bet versus a financial issue.\n\nThe trend continued: An October 2023 Beige Book note said many sectors \"reduced hiring plans\" and were \"rightsizing\" their budgets because of rising rates. Fast forward to today, and businesses are still grappling with the increased cost of funding, even as Powell and the Fed have moved slowly to lower their benchmark rate. In October's Beige Book, businesses big and small mentioned layoffs and attrition more so than new hiring. Beige Book reports over the past year suggest that AI is contributing to hiring softening in certain areas, such as call centers and accounting firms, but not widespread job displacement. Instead, \"uncertainty\" and \"tariffs\" were two of the most frequently mentioned words by companies such as Tesla, JPMorgan, and Whirlpool during earnings calls.\n\nBut saying the need for layoffs is the result of a long-term change in the cost of financing isn't very sexy. Better to point to AI as both an excuse for layoffs and a way to give investors hope for the future. Chen Zhao, head of economics research at the real estate firm Redfin, said many companies are struggling to balance profits with the steep cost of borrowing money. This is especially true in the housing sector, she said, because it's sensitive to the federal funds rate. She said fields like tech are similarly vulnerable.\n\n\"I think that what's happening is just simple economics,\" she said, adding, \"But when you say that you're going to do layoffs or you're not going to be hiring as much, it doesn't sound very good to investors. It sounds a lot better if you say that you're seeing all these productivity enhancements because of AI.\"\n\nEach recent technological development — computers, cellphones, the internet — has reshaped the job market and the workplace, but people tend to underestimate the timeline. Economists said it will take years, possibly decades, before we have concrete evidence that AI is replacing jobs on a large scale. And AI may create thousands of jobs as it makes others obsolete.\n\n\"I think the overall evolution of the technology is going to be a lot slower than both the optimists and doomers think,\" said Scott Lincicome, vice president of economics and trade at the right-leaning Cato Institute. AI has developed rapidly, and while it can perform basic tasks, it is still a long way from replacing human judgment, creativity, and decision-making. \"There will certainly be disruptions, that's inevitable,\" he said. \"But it won't be cataclysmic.\"\n\nThe job market is in a rut — but chatbots aren't the sole, or even the main, culprit.\n\nDespite the weakening job market numbers, the Federal Reserve has cut rates three times this year, a cautious policy stance brought on by economic precarity. Recent Fed reports show that trade policy and inflation are keeping Powell and company from cutting rates at a faster pace, even as the employment outlook weakens. It has also sparked division within the central bank itself: The December meeting saw the highest number of Fed members disagreeing with the interest rate committee's final decision since 2019. Economic projections also show the median committee member expects one rate cut in 2026, less than projected at this time last year. The moves signal an economic situation that isn't catastrophic, so long as Powell plays his cards carefully.\n\nA pattern of cuts could start bringing relief for borrowers, but it will take time for the economy to recover — and there are still steep headwinds. Fast-changing tariffs are exacerbating the impact of high rates, making many businesses hesitant to invest or spend money. As Lincicome put it, \"Tariff uncertainty is really a drag on the job market because companies are saddled with millions, if not billions, of dollars in additional taxes and tariff costs.\"\n\nDeclining immigration due to Trump's deportation policies is also part of the equation: Fewer immigrants in the workforce is contributing to a slowing labor force participation rate. Ajilore also said that the sweeping cost-cutting strategy of DOGE for the federal workforce added fuel to the corporate world's \"efficiency\" crusade. It all adds up to some extremely valid job anxiety for workers.\n\nEconomists expect the market to grow and adapt alongside new technology — and the AI takeover forecast is far less grim than most people realize. The chatbot revolution may come someday. But, for better or worse, the real headliner is the federal funds rate.\n\nAllie Kelly is a reporter on Business Insider's Economy team.

The Federal Reserve announced a third interest rate cut last week, and mortgage rates shrugged. The 30-year interest rate has barely moved since the end of October.\n\nSee which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nMORE: Read about the best mortgage refinance lenders right now.\n\nYou can use the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator below to play around with how different terms and rates will affect your monthly payment. Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders.\n\nToday’s average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.13%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low.\n\nIf you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 6.13% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,824, and you’d pay $356,569 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.53% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to compound.\n\nHowever, your monthly payments will be higher because you’re squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.53% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,456. But you’d only pay $142,085 in interest over the life of the loan.\n\nHow much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\n\nWith an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year.\n\nAdjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate goes up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends — that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later.\n\nLately, ARM rates have occasionally been similar to or higher than fixed rates. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nYou can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown is also an option — for example, maybe you get a 6.25% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4.25% for year one, increase to 5.25% for year two, then settle in at 6.25% for the remainder of your term.\n\nJust consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself if you’ll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.\n\nHere are interest rates for some of the most popular mortgage terms: According to Zillow data, the national average 30-year fixed rate is 6.13%, the 15-year fixed rate is 5.53%, and the 5/1 ARM rate is 6.24%.\n\nA normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 6.13%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data. The average might be higher or lower depending on where you live in the U.S. And of course, your credit score.\n\nNot much. According to its November forecast, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.4% through 2026. Fannie Mae also predicts a 30-year rate above 6% through next year, yet dipping down to 5.9% in Q4 2026.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck.

Here's what to do.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how today's interest rates would affect your monthly mortgage payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. You also have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues, if applicable. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThere are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.\n\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.\n\nThe main disadvantage of 30-year fixed mortgage rates is the mortgage interest, both in the short and long term.\n\nA 30-year fixed term comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed term, and it’s higher than the intro rate to a 30-year ARM. The higher your rate, the higher your monthly payment. You’ll also pay much \n\nThe pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are basically swapped with those of the 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.\n\nHowever, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.\n\nDig deeper into 15-year vs. 30-year mortgages.\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined amount of time, then change it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.\n\nThe main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't necessarily reflect this, though — in some cases, fixed rates are actually lower. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)\n\nWith an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.\n\nBut if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.\n\nLearn whether now is a good time to get an adjustable-rate mortgage.\n\nFirst of all, now is a relatively good time to buy a house compared to a couple of years ago. Home prices aren't spiking like they were during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. So, if you want or need to buy a house soon, you should feel pretty good about the current housing market.\n\nThe best time to buy is typically whenever it makes sense for your stage of life. Trying to time the real estate market can be as futile as timing the stock market — buy when it's the right time for you.\n\nWhich is more important, your home price or mortgage rate?\n\nAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.13% right now. But keep in mind that mortgage rates vary by state and even ZIP code. For example, if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be higher.\n\nEconomists don't expect mortgage interest rates to significantly drop before the end of the year. They may inch down here or there, but they probably won't plummet.\n\nOverall, mortgage rates have dropped gradually. The 30-year fixed rate is still below where it was one year ago.\n\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.\n\nWith mortgage rates hovering above 6%, is now a good time to refinance your mortgage?

    "description": "The Fed cut interest rates at its December meeting. Here's how it affects your money — from mortgages and auto loans to credit cards and savings.",
    "fullText": "The Federal Reserve made its final decision of 2025, cutting interest rates for the third meeting in a row — and it set the tone for where interest rates will go in the new year.\n\nThe call will have ripple effects across consumer prices, the job market, and Corporate America through 2026 and beyond. Here's how the decision will affect you.\n\nThirty-year fixed mortgages, two-year auto loans, and credit card rates tend to fluctuate alongside the federal funds rate. And, while inflation remains above the Fed's 2% goal, mortgage rates have largely cooled in recent months in anticipation of rate reductions.\n\nA quarter-point cut could mean lower returns on investment for savers using high-yield savings accounts or certificates of deposit, though it would become cheaper to pay off credit cards. Lower rates would also make home equity lines and small business loans more accessible to Americans.\n\nElizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, told Business Insider the cut could be a positive sign for people applying to roles in the sluggish labor market: If job seekers \"hear that the Fed is responding to an unfavorable labor market, that's going to feel good to them; they may feel like relief is on the horizon,\" she said.\n\nThe labor market has shown signs of weakness in recent months. Job seekers of all ages have told Business Insider that they've been through grueling application cycles without an offer, while recruiters are drowning in resumés. Over the summer, the number of Americans looking for work eclipsed the number of available jobs and labor force participation has been trending downward. The unemployment rate, however, is still relatively low, hovering a little above 4% for most of this year.\n\nSustained rate cuts would bolster the job market by making it easier for businesses to borrow and invest money. This would free up more funds for companies to hire and pay employees, which could lead to higher consumer spending — all factors needed for a healthy economy.\n\nAnd lower interest rates are historically good news for the stock market. When it's cheaper to borrow money and approve loans, both companies and individuals are more likely to invest. With more funds in the market, Wall Street could see a boost in 2026.\n\nMadison Hoff contributed reporting.",

    "fullText": "The Fed cut interest rates for the third time this year on Wednesday, and the meeting held some key takeaways for how the central bank is thinking about the economy heading into 2026.\n\nFrom the labor market to inflation to stocks, here's everything to know about the latest Fed decision.\n\nFed leaders anticipate more economic growth in 2026 and stable unemployment levels, but are somewhat concerned about slowing labor demand and participation. Lower rates could help juice hiring, Powell said.\n\nIn terms of AI, the Fed chair said chatbots are not yet replacing jobs — even as Corporate America sees shrinking while collar roles. \"It's part of the story, but it's not a big part of the story yet,\" he said. And, though some Big Tech firms and major retailers, have had high-profile cuts in 2025, Powell added that overall layoff rates are still relatively low.\n\nThe figure remains slightly above the Fed's 2% goal, though data is limited due to the government shutdown. With lower rates, there's a risk consumer prices will rise too. At the same time, Powell said consumer spending has been strong and the main driver of inflation right now is tariff policy, not broad economic weakness.\n\nIt was a hawkish rate cut overall, but markets rallied sharply anyway.\n\nThe S&P 500 edged up to a near-record close and the Dow jump almost 500 points, adding to gains as Powell's press conference got going. A few things came out of the meeting that boosted investors' bullishness.\n\nWith Powell's term up in May, Trump is set to name a successor in January.\n\n\"I really want to turn this job over to whoever replaces me with the economy in really good shape,\" he said. \"I want inflation to be back down to 2% and I want the labor market to be strong — that's what I want. All of my efforts are to get to that place.\"\n\nMembers of the Federal Open Market Committee showed significant division on Wednesday, with three members dissenting to the cut call. It's the biggest split seen at a Fed meeting since 2019 and signals ongoing tension between the Fed's dual mandate and how each member weighs employment and inflation risks.\n\nPowell, however, said there's no bad blood.\n\n\"The discussions we have are as good as any we've had in my 14 years at the Fed,\" he said. \"They're very thoughtful and respectful and people have strong views",

    "description": "Investors expect the Fed to cut rates on Wednesday and keep cutting in 2026, but bond yields are hinting at deeper uncertainty ahead for markets.",
    "fullText": "Markets think a rate cut on Wednesday is nearly a foregone conclusion, but bond yields are doing something strange.\n\nDespite a cut being priced in for weeks, US government bonds have been selling off, driving yields higher. The 10-year Treasury yield has jumped by about 20 basis points from its low in November, hovering around 4.20%. on Wednesday.\n\nIt's a reminder that long-term bond yields and the Fed's short-term borrowing rate do not move in lockstep, but it's still an unusual move given predictions for rates to keep coming down in 2026.\n\nThere are a few things that help explain the move.\n\nFront and center for bond investors is the inflation outlook, and it's murky, to say the least.\n\nWhile price growth has cooled in the US since peaking around 9% in the summer of 2022, inflation has crept back up in recent months.\n\nIf the Fed cuts interest rates too quickly, that could stoke fresh inflation. That concern has grown even more pressing to investors in recent weeks as President Donald Trump is expected to announce his pick for the next Fed Chair.\n\nKevin Hassett, a Trump ally who has long supported the president's view that interest rates should be significantly lower, has emerged as the top candidate in recent weeks.\n\n\"The biggest thing happening in the background is the question of who will lead the Fed,\" Christian Hoffmann, the head of fixed income at Thornburg Investment Management, said, pointing to Hassett's potential influence over the market's monetary policy expectations even before the new Fed Chair is sworn in.\n\nThe calculus being made in the bond market seems to be that Hassett could lower rates too far, too fast, aggravating inflation and prompting a hawkish response from the Fed down the road.\n\n\"Something that every Fed Chair has traditionally had to do from day one is establish credibility as a legitimate inflation fighter. If they don't, they introduce volatility into the Treasury markets and create broad unease, which no one wants,\" he added.\n\nTorsten Sløk, the chief economist at Apollo, also flicked at this disconnect between rate expectations and bond yields in a note on Wednesday.\n\n\"Why are long-term interest rates going up when the Fed is cutting rates,\" Sløk wrote. \"Is the market worried about growing Treasury issuance, or about a new Fed leadership effectively raising the inflation target from 2% to, say, 4%?\" he added, referring to how higher debt levels can also stoke inflation in the future.\n\nEven without inflation complicating things, investors aren't confident that the Fed has the green light to keep cutting rates in 2026.\n\nInterest rates already appear to be close to neutral, a level that prompts neither economic expansion nor contraction, according to Chris Brigati, the chief investment officer at SWBC.\n\n\"We expect the Fed to remain on hold when it comes to rates for the first half of 2026, even with the pressure from the many doves,\" Brigati said on Wednesday, adding that he only expects the Fed to issue one rate cut next year.\n\nStrategists at Deutsche Bank said this week that they expect the 10-year US Treasury to climb to around 4.45% by mid-next year, a jump of about 25 basis points from current levels.\n\n\"This mildly bearish view is predicated on expectations of a more hawkish Fed rate cut path than market pricing,\" the bank wrote in a note on Tuesday.\n\nInvestors are pricing in a 58% chance the Fed will only lower interest rates once or twice by the end of 2026, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nThe US bond market is following a broader trend as investors expect less monetary easing from central banks around the world in the coming year.\n\nThe yield on the British 10-year gilt traded around 4.52% on Wednesday, around 14 basis points higher than its low in November.\n\nThe yield on the German 10-year Bund also rose to 2.86% on Wednesday, around 22 basis points higher from its latest low.\n\nJapan's 10-year note was yielding around 1.95% this week, up around 29 basis points from the start of November.\n\n\"Long-dated government bonds in many developed markets (DMs) have sold off aggressively over the past month or so as investors have pared back rate cut expectations or, increasingly, pencilled in rate hikes,\" James Reilly, a senior markets economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note on Tuesday.\n\n\"While we think these moves are overdone in many economies, we think there is still room for investors to pare back expectations for Fed easing,\" he added.",

There will also likely be a handful of central bankers who will give \"soft dissents\" on where they see monetary policy going forward in the dot plot, he added.\n\nWhile investors expect the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points, officials will probably send out some hawkish signals to the market on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs said.\n\nFed officials will likely suggest that the bar is higher for rate cuts going into next year, David Mericle, Goldman's chief US economist, wrote in a client note on Sunday.

Thirty-year fixed mortgages, two-year auto loans, and credit card rates tend to fluctuate alongside the federal funds rate.\n\nAnd, while inflation remains above the Fed's 2% goal, mortgage rates have largely cooled in recent months in anticipation of rate reductions. Lower rates could also make home equity lines and small business loans more affordable — though savers might see less return on their high-yield savings accounts.\n\nInvestors seem to be pricing in a \"sell the news\" reaction to Wednesday's rate decision, strategists at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note on Monday.\n\nThe bank added, though, that it remains optimistic about the market's direction over the medium term. That's because the job market looks on track to show moderate weakness in the coming months, which should clear the path for Fed rate cuts in 2026. Stronger earnings should also help lift the market higher, the bank said.\n\nPowell has said the Fed's cautious strategy this year stems from uncertainty over President Donald Trump's fast-changing tariff policies and stubborn inflation rates. The job market, meanwhile, has had a rocky 2025.\n\nBusiness Insider has heard from frustrated job seekers at all levels of the career ladder, particularly those feeling pushed out of white collar roles.

This past summer, the number of Americans looking for work eclipsed the number of vacancies, though the unemployment rate itself is still relatively low.\n\n\"There is no risk-free path for policy as we navigate this tension between our employment and inflation goals,\" Powell said in October, adding, \"Ultimately, lower rates will support more demand, and that'll support hiring over time. And, of course, we also have to be careful about this.\"\n\nThe Fed's dual mandate is to keep America's prices stable and the labor market healthy. These two goals have been challenging to balance this year: higher interest rates can help curb inflation but risk cooling down an already chilly labor market.\n\nThe Fed is also missing key pieces of data due to the government shutdown. The Bureau of Labor Statistics canceled the October consumer price index and unemployment rate releases, and the November jobs report and inflation data won't be released in time for today's meeting. December's decision will be more difficult without this information.\n\nUS stock futures are virtually unmoved as of just before 6:20 a.m. ET.

    "description": "The Fed's final meeting of 2025 is expected to see a third interest rate cut from the central bank, with investors focusing on the outlook for 2026.",
    "fullText": "The Federal Reserve's final meeting of the year began on Tuesday morning, Dec. 9, and the central bank is scheduled to announce its final monetary policy decision at 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nInvestors expect the Fed will cut rates by 0.25%, its third cut of the year, at the conclusion of its two-day meeting, with data from the CME Group showing an 87% chance the central bank will cut rates this week.\n\nAlong with its final policy decision of the year, the Fed will also publish its final Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) for 2025, which includes forecasts from Fed officials on economic growth, inflation, and interest rates for the coming years.\n\nIn September, the SEP showed the Fed's median forecasts calling for just one interest rate cut in 2026 following three reductions in 2025. Changes to this outlook will be top of mind for investors on Wednesday.\n\nInvestors will also be closely watching for further disagreement among Fed officials, as October's policy statement revealed two members of the FOMC voted against the decision to lower rates by 0.25%.\n\nIn today's Morning Brief newsletter, Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban asks: Why are bond yields rising as the Fed cuts rates?\n\nYahoo Finance's Ivana Pino reports:\n\nGlobal bond yields have risen to highs not seen since 2009 ahead of a key Federal Reserve policy meeting. A sign concerns are growing that interest-rate cutting cycles from the US may soon be coming to an end.\n\nShould the Federal Reserve lower interest rates this week, the effects are likely to ripple out to interest-earning accounts. Here's what you need to know about how the federal funds rate impacts certificates of deposit (CDs).\n\nYahoo Finance's Ivana Pino reports:\n\nMany prospective homebuyers may be wondering, \"When will mortgage rates go back down to 3%?\" The quick answer, according to Yahoo Finance's Hal Bundrick, is that it's not likely anytime soon.\n\nUS stocks were little changed at Tuesday's close as traders bet that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to CME Group's FedWatch tool, traders assigned a 87.6% probability to the Fed cutting rates by 25 basis points, down marginally from odds placed on a cut a day ago.\n\nAlthough stocks were muted in the lead-up to the Fed decision, one strategist noted that Chair Jerome Powell's comments at the press conference will likely affect market sentiment heading into 2026.\n\n“A 25 basis point cut is important for investor sentiment, not necessarily for many of the companies that we invest in,\" Siebert Financial chief investment officer Mark Malek told Yahoo Finance about how the Fed decision could affect investments. \"This 25 basis points is not going to make or break a lot of these companies.\"\n\nBarring a major deterioration in the labor market, Malek expects the Fed to try to temper expectations for further rate cuts. That's why Powell's remarks on the labor market will be especially scrutinized, he said.\n\n\"It is important that the Fed is showing that they're concerned about the labor market,\" Malek said. \"It's good for the consumer to know that the Fed's got their backs, if people are worried about their jobs, or maybe they're going to pull back on spending after the holiday season.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower short-term interest rates on Wednesday for the third time this year, affecting the interest consumers pay and receive on many of their accounts.\n\nYahoo Finance's Hal Bundrick breaks down how discounts to the federal funds rate will impact deposits, credit, and debt:\n\n2025 has been a year of modest earnings on deposit accounts. Another rate cut won't help.\n\nThe national average of interest paid on checking accounts has barely budged much this year and remains at 0.07%. Interest rates on savings accounts are only marginally better, remaining at 0.40%.\n\nImagine that moving even lower. Is it possible? Yes.\n\nStock prices often react to the Fed’s rate actions, but they are only one factor among many affecting the investing climate and stock prices.\n\nIf you intend to manage your investments to suit the current environment, keep watch on broader economic and corporate profit trends alongside interest rates. If you prefer to stay conservative, fill your portfolio with high-quality stocks that have proven themselves in all economic cycles.\n\nThen, wait patiently for long-term growth.\n\nRead more about how the Fed affects your money here.\n\nAs markets look ahead to the path of Federal Reserve policy in 2026, President Trump offered one clue in an interview with Politico released Tuesday.\n\nTrump responded “yes” when asked if quickly reducing interest rates would be a litmus test for his choice of central bank leader. Trump has a list of five candidates to replace current Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term expires in May 2026.\n\n“Yes. Well, this guy ... should too,” Trump said, referring to Powell. “I think he’s a combination of not a smart person and doesn’t like Trump.”\n\nStocks were muted at the market open on Tuesday after a Federal Reserve spokesperson confirmed the FOMC meeting was underway.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was flat and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.2%. All three indexes came off modest losses on Monday.\n\nTreasury yields steadied as investors awaited the release of jobs data and the Federal Open Market Committee's policy decision.\n\nThe benchmark 10-year yield (^TNX) fell 2 basis points to 4.14%. Meanwhile, the 30-year yield (^TYX) declined 3 basis points to 4.78% after hitting its highest level in about three months on Monday.\n\nRead more about today's market action here.\n\nThe consensus around the Federal Reserve’s policy move on Wednesday has firmed around a 25 basis point rate cut — even if the decision will be a close one, as Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger details.\n\nTraders are pricing in an 89% chance that the Fed lowers interest rates by 25 basis points at the conclusion of the FOMC meeting on Wednesday, according to CMEGroup's FedWatch.\n\nBut looking ahead to the January meeting and 2026 broadly, the path is even less certain.\n\nOne widely held view is that the Fed will move forward with a \"hawkish cut\" on Wednesday, in which the central bank lowers rates but hints at a pause in January, JPMorgan’s Michael Feroli wrote in a Dec. 5 note. Traders have put a 23% probability that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting rates at its Jan. 27-28 meeting.\n\n“At the press conference, we expect that Powell will stress that with policy rates close to neutral, the time for risk management cuts is past and that further cuts would only come with a material deterioration in the labor market,” Feroli wrote.\n\n\"We don’t expect him to comment directly on January,\" Feroli added, \"but instead to highlight that there is a lot of data to be released between now and the January meeting and that will guide their decision.\"\n\nFor the remainder of the year, views range from the Fed cutting rates at its next few policy meetings due to a deterioration in the labor market to additional rate cuts in the summer due to a change in Fed leadership.\n\nRead more about 2026 predictions for Federal Reserve policy here.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's eventful 2025 wraps up this week, and another 0.25% rate cut is expected.\n\nBut the real drama in the central bank's release will be in how much agreement, or not, there is with this decision.\n\nAs Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger noted in her preview of the event, at least three regional Fed presidents have signaled that the case for cutting rates this week does not appear obvious. One of those includes Kansas City Fed president Jeff Schmid, who voted against October's rate cut.\n\nAdd in that Fed Governor Stephen Miran has twice dissented in favor of a larger rate cut, the central bank could be looking at upward of four votes against the expected decision to lower rates by another 0.25% on Wednesday.\n\nRead Jennifer's full preview of the meeting here.",

    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance rates. People shouldn't necessarily wait until after the Fed meeting to lock in a rate, as rates are likely to hold steady.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates have risen since last week. According to Zillow data, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is up 13 basis points to 6.10%, and the 15-year fixed rate has increased by 14 basis points to 5.55%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will announce whether it is cutting the federal funds rate for a third time this year on Wednesday. Many experts predict that the central bank will lower its rate again — but based on how mortgage rates have reacted to previous rate cuts, that doesn't necessarily mean home loan rates will decrease in response. However, they might fall if the Fed indicates that it intends to slash rates more aggressively next year.\n\nLearn more about why mortgage rates didn't decrease after the last fed funds rate cut.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nSee the mortgage lenders with the best rates this week.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nMORE: Read about the best mortgage refinance lenders right now.\n\nYou can use the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator below to play around with how different terms and rates will affect your monthly payment. Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders.\n\nToday’s average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.10%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low.\n\nIf you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 6.10% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,818, and you’d pay $354,474 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.55% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to compound.\n\nHowever, your monthly payments will be higher because you’re squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.55% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,459. But you’d only pay $142,659.\n\nHow much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\n\nWith an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year.\n\nAdjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate goes up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends — that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later.\n\nLately, ARM rates have occasionally been similar to or higher than fixed rates. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nYou can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown is also an option — for example, maybe you get a 6.25% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4.25% for year one, increase to 5.25% for year two, then settle in at 6.25% for the remainder of your term.\n\nJust consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself if you’ll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.\n\nHere are interest rates for some of the most popular mortgage terms: According to Zillow data, the national average 30-year fixed rate is 6.10%, the 15-year fixed rate is 5.55%, and the 5/1 ARM rate is 6.45%.\n\nA normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 6.10%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data. The average might be higher or lower depending on where you live in the U.S.\n\nMortgage rates are not expected to drop significantly before the end of the year, as economists continue to monitor inflation, tariffs, and the Federal Reserve's actions.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nA mortgage refinance involves replacing your original home loan with a new one. Learn how to refinance a mortgage loan and decide if it's the right choice for you.\n\nMortgage rates are down, so refinancing soon could be a good idea. Learn what to know and how to prepare for refinancing your mortgage at the beginning of 2026.\n\nThe Fed once again voted to hold the federal funds rate steady. Will interest rates begin dropping before the year is up?\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nChase Home Loans is offering a \"refinancing rate sale\" for rate-and-term and cash-out refinancing.
