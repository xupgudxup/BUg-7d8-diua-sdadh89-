    "fullText": "Americans' wallets are ringing in the new year with a little relief from rising prices. The US started 2026 with a slower inflation rate than at the end of 2025.\n\nThe consumer price index, an inflation measure, increased 2.4% in January from a year ago, the smallest increase since last May and below the 2.7% increase in both November and December. Economists expected a year-over-year increase of just 2.5%.\n\nCore CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.5% year over year in January, as expected, just below the previous 2.6% increase.\n\nEnergy prices fell 0.1% over the year. Gasoline fell 7.5%, but natural gas rose 9.8%. The shelter index increased 3% over the year, and the food index rose 2.9%. Prices of used cars and trucks fell 2%, while new-vehicle prices increased 0.4%.\n\nCPI increased 0.2% over the month, just below December's 0.3% increase and the forecast of 0.3%. Meanwhile, core CPI increased 0.3% over the month, matching the forecast and just above December's 0.2% rise.\n\n\"Inflation came in as expected, but markets are breathing easier as price pressures remain contained despite very strong labor market data earlier this week and the risk of further tariff pass‑through,\" Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in commentary.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics released its rescheduled jobs report on Wednesday, due to the partial government shutdown, which showed the US added fewer jobs in 2025 than previously reported but better job growth this past January than expected. Unemployment fell in January from December as labor force participation ticked up.\n\n\"The 181,000 jobs that were added across 2025 really starkly show how challenging the labor market was and how little movement on either side there really has been as both employers and workers were stuck in place and clinging to stability,\" Nicole Bachaud, an economist at ZipRecruiter, told Business Insider.\n\nFederal Open Market Committee members held interest rates steady in their first decision of the year in January. CME FedWatch showed a roughly 90% chance after the new inflation report that the Fed would hold rates steady in their meeting next month, similar to where those odds stood before the release.\n\n\"Friday's delayed CPI for January was muted and in-line with expectations and it won't increase the likelihood of a rate cut within the next few months largely because of Wednesday's blowout employment numbers, which threw ice cold water on any hopes of a near-term rate cut,\" Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer of Regan Capital, said in commentary.",

    "description": "Investors are bracing for a report on the consumer price index for January, a key input for Fed policy making on rates.",
    "fullText": "US stock futures slid on Friday, eyeing more losses after a broad market sell-off as Wall Street waited for the latest reading on consumer inflation for a steer on the path of interest rates.\n\nContracts on the S&P 500 (ES=F) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) both dropped roughly 0.4%. Meanwhile, Nasdaq 100 futures (NQ=F) fell 0.3%, signaling a return of pressure on techs.\n\nCaution prevails after a day of heavy selling as fears about AI disruption spilled into sectors such as real estate, logistics, and transportation — \"old economy\" names previously seen as a safe alternative to AI-tied stocks. Techs got pummeled, with all seven of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps finishing lower.\n\nThat looks set to resumer as investors scrutinize the latest earnings for the next \"shoot first, ask questions later\" AI scare. Applied Materials (AMAT) stock surged over 10% as the chip toolmaker's upbeat outlook mirrored robust AI demand. But Pinterest (PINS) shares tumbled about 20% as revenue fell short and analysts fretted about AI risks to its discovery platform.\n\nMarkets are also bracing with Friday morning's report on January's consumer price index, the inflation measure favored by the Federal Reserve in policy making. The key inflation measure is likely to shape expectations for an already complicated Federal Reserve policy.\n\nThe slightly delayed data will shed light on whether price pressures are turning less stubbornly sticky to start 2026. Expectations are for a slowing in the annual CPI rate to around 2.5%, and any surprise is likely to shape already complicated calculations for the path of interest rates.\n\nOn the earnings front, Rivian (RIVN) shares jumped almost 20% following its fourth quarter earnings beat late Thursday. The EV maker said its R2 midsize model is on track for delivery before the summer. Before the bell, eyes are on Moderna's (MRNA) report, after it suffered a 10% drop in share value this week as the FDA rejected a new flu vaccine.\n\nWall Street’s fears of business disruption caused by artificial intelligence are turning into a blessing for Asian stocks, fueling demand for the region’s leading chipmakers that dominate the industry’s supply chain.\n\nThe MSCI Asia Pacific Index has risen more than 12% in 2026, in contrast to losses in US benchmarks as shares were sold off on fears that AI models may threaten the business of software, legal and real estate service providers. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is down 0.2% for the year, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) gauge has lost around 2%.\n\nThe divergence underscores global funds’ shift of preference from AI pioneers burdened by massive spending toward hardware producers with strong pricing power, many of whom are in Asia. Surging memory chip prices have been a boon for the region’s heavyweights such as Samsung Electronics Co. (005930.KS, SSNLF), while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s (TSM, 2330.TW) irreplaceable role as the world’s leading contract chipmaker has provided support for Taiwanese stocks.\n\n“The main worry of the US is hyperscaler spending money,” said Richard Tang, head of research Hong Kong at Julius Baer. “Most of Asia’s tech exposure is upstream. Whoever wins in the end, upstream will still collect revenue from downstream players.”\n\nRivian (RIVN) stock soared 19% during premarket hours on Friday following the release of better-than-expected fourth-quarter results on Thursday.\n\nYahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports:\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) stock climbed 11% during premarket hours on Friday after the ⁠semiconductor equipment maker beat Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom lines.\n\nThe after-hours reaction to Applied Materials' results added to the strong run for the stock in 2026. Year to date, shares are up 27%.\n\nPinterest stock sank 19% before the bell on Friday after forecasting first quarter revenue below analysts' estimates on Thursday.",

    "description": "Wall Street is gearing up for an update on the Fed's favored inflation gauge after the jobs report bolstered the case against cutting rates.",
    "fullText": "US stocks turned sharply lower Thursday, as investors revived a rotation out of megacap tech stocks as they looked ahead Friday's inflation reading to guide rate-cut bets, already dampened by a strong January jobs report.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell roughly 1%, or over 500 points, after the blue-chip benchmark snapped a three-day win streak on Wednesday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 1.2%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell nearly 2%.\n\nThe mixed picture comes as investors scrutinize incoming earnings closely for clues to the sectors vulnerable to AI disruption, which spurred the recent meltdown in software stocks. Cisco Systems (CSCO) stock fell over 11% as its gloomy profit outlook overshadowed a rise in sales amid Big Tech's AI buildout.\n\nBig Tech stocks followed suit. Nvidia and Microsoft both fell over 1%, while Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) saw steeper losses.\n\nMeanwhile, attention is starting to turn to Friday’s Consumer Price Index report. A softer reading will build hopes that price pressures are easing while economic growth remains intact.\n\nBefore then, the weekly reading on jobless claims — which showed a smaller decline than expected — came in focus after nonfarm-payrolls data showed the US economy added twice as many jobs as anticipated in January. The strength in hiring complicates expectations for Fed policy. A resilient labor market, paired with sticky inflation, is seen as reducing the likelihood of near-term interest-rate cuts — a key driver of recent equity gains.\n\nElsewhere on the earnings front, McDonald’s (MCD) shares nudged higher after the burger giant's earnings beat. Looking ahead, Coinbase (COIN), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Rivian (RIVN) are highlights on Thursday's docket, all due after the market close.\n\nApple (AAPL) stock was the worst-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" stock on Thursday afternoon, dropping around 5% as part of a broad sell-off across tech.\n\nReports on Wednesday that Apple's highly anticipated upgrade to its Siri voice assistant could be delayed also weighed on shares, which are off by 4% year to date. The new Siri was intended to be launched as part of an operating system update in March, but certain features could be postponed due to issues in testing, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.\n\nThe rollout of the revamped Siri, first announced in June 2024, has been riddled with delays, putting investors on edge about Apple's artificial intelligence capabilities.\n\nSeparately, US Federal Trade Commission Chairman Andrew Ferguson said Wednesday he sent a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook, raising concerns about allegations that Apple News has been censoring content from conservative publications.\n\nMeta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Tesla (TSLA) were also down more than 2% as tech got hit. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) was the lone Magnificent Seven name in the green, up 0.4%.\n\nInflation in electricity prices has more than doubled headline PCE inflation as the AI infrastructure and data center build-out have sent power demand soaring through the US, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a client note on Wednesday.\n\nElectricity prices rose by 6.9% year over year through December 2025, the bank wrote, while PCE inflation rose 2.9% over the same period. On an annualized average basis, electricity prices rose by 6.8% since January 2022, while headline PCE inflation rose by 3.4%.\n\nThe rapid inflation in electricity prices is primarily driven by two key factors: the rapid construction of data centers, which demand enormous amounts of energy to operate, and the boom in capital investment by utility companies as they attempt to increase energy supply to meet demand, \"which will raise utility costs and therefore electricity prices.\"\n\nThe analysts also noted several bottlenecks that will prevent energy supply from catching up with demand, including strict regulations and shortages of critical hardware such as transformers and natural gas turbines.\n\n\"The combination of strong demand and sluggish supply will likely increase power prices in regional wholesale markets — where most utilities and other market participants procure electricity before delivering it to final customers,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nThough they note that the pressure will likely be \"much more acute in a few markets than the US as a whole because data centers are highly geographically concentrated,\" with \"about 1% of all US counties account[ing] for about 70% of data center capacity.\"\n\nThe largest jumps in electricity inflation are likely to be seen in \"tighter power markets\" in the Midwest, California, and Texas, the analysts wrote.\n\nThe US stock market turned into the red through late morning trading on Thursday, marking a sharp reversal from earlier gains on the major indexes.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way down, shedding roughly 1.5%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which snapped a three-day streak of gains on Wednesday, both lost roughly 1%.\n\nThe downturn comes as investors look for any signs of weakness in the earnings reports of companies vulnerable to AI disruption, which has triggered the meltdown in software stocks over the past week-and-a-half. Cisco Systems (CSCO) stock fell over 11% as its gloomy profit outlook overshadowed a rise in sales amid Big Tech's AI buildout.\n\nThe tech sector's largest names also dragged the sector down, as Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) both fell over 1% while Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) saw steeper losses.\n\nWhile investors got a bullish read on the labor market in Wednesday's nonfarm payrolls report, showing that January added twice as many jobs as expected, data published Thursday on initial jobless claims dimmed some of that optimism, showing a smaller decline than expected.\n\nOil prices fell on Thursday as investors weighed a new demand forecast from the International Energy Agency, which predicted a slowdown, and unclear progress in talks between the US and Iran.\n\nFutures on international pricing benchmark Brent crude (BZ=F) and US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CL=F) shed roughly 1.8% to trade below $68.20 and $63.50 a barrel, respectively.\n\nIn a new publication on Thursday, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said world oil demand would rise by 850,000 barrels per day (bpd) this year, 80,000 bpd lower than the agency's January forecast. The figure is also much lower than that published by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on Wednesday, which said demand would rise by 1.38 million bpd this year.\n\nThe IEA also maintained its call that the market will spend 2026 in a deep oversupply glut, which the agency pegged at 3.73 million bpd of excess oil.\n\nWhile market watchers had broadly coalesced around the likelihood of a supply glut through 2026, with prices expected to drop, oil prices have instead gained roughly 10% since the start of the year, following a series of geopolitical events, including the US takeover of Venezuela's oil industry, widespread protests in Iran, and damage to key export terminals on the Caspian Sea.\n\nIn public comments on Thursday, the CEO of commodities trading house Vitol, Russell Hardy, said the global oil market is tightening instead of loosening, especially as the US ratchets up pressure on Russia and Iran, pushing buyers to find barrels in other markets.\n\nVitol is the world's largest independent trader of oil.\n\nThe key swing factor for oil prices right now remains ongoing negotiations between the US and Iran over the Iranian regime's uranium enrichment technology. President Trump on Wednesday deployed more military craft to the region, and analysts say any military action could result in retaliation from Iran, which controls the Strait of Hormuz, a critically important global chokepoint for oil flows.\n\nAs worries around the electricity and water demand of AI data centers have taken root, federal and state lawmakers have begun pushing back, introducing bills to regulate or halt development entirely.\n\nThis week, Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) introduced the first bipartisan bill in Congress designed to prevent data center power usage from affecting consumers' electric bills.\n\nA week earlier, on Feb. 6, New York became at least the sixth state to have its legislators propose a bill to pause data center construction within state lines. This legislation would effectively shut out New York as a potential site for new data centers if it passes.\n\nIn doing so, New York's legislators join federal and state congressional leaders across the country in attempting to legislate an industry that has boomed and threatens an already overtaxed power grid.\n\n\"The regulatory framework was not designed for single-sector load shocks, so policymakers are attempting to adjust in real time to the scale and speed at which the load forecasts are changing,\" Didi Caldwell, founder and CEO of site selection advisory firm Global Location Strategies, told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"The system is ill-equipped to address the dramatic increase in demand created by AI data centers,\" she said.\n\nAnd lawmakers are trying to catch up.\n\nWednesday's unexpectedly bullish jobs report has all but shuttered the odds of rate cuts under current Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and narrowed the path to cuts under a Kevin Warsh-led Fed, Bank of America economists wrote in a client note on Thursday, calling the report \"a feast for the hawks.\"\n\nData released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday showed that the US added 130,000 jobs in January, doubling economists' expectations of 65,000. The unemployment rate also fell to 4.3% from 4.4%, beating expectations that the rate would remain flat.\n\nThe data gave lift to the argument that even as inflation has stayed elevated, the labor market is remaining resilient. These conditions are seen as reducing the odds of rate cuts in the near future.\n\n\"Payrolls surged above all expectations, the downward revisions were minimal, and wages and hours were up as well,\" the analysts wrote. \"The broad-based strength in the Jan jobs report vindicates our view that the Fed won't cut under Powell.\"\n\nFor now, the economists wrote, BofA is maintaining its prediction of two rate cuts under a Warsh-led Fed. But the swing metric for potential rate cuts under Warsh, they wrote, will be the unemployment rate.\n\n\"The key risk to his call for significant cuts is a decline in the u-rate. Therefore, the path to cuts under Warsh (which we don't think the economy needs) now looks narrower,\" the BofA economists wrote.\n\n\"If the u-rate is stable or down even further by June, Warsh might be stuck on hold for the rest of the year.\"\n\nUS stocks rose in the first minutes of trading on Thursday as investors digested the latest string of earnings reports and looked ahead to Friday's inflation reading as the next major signpost for rate-cut bets.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) picked up roughly 0.5% as trading began, after the blue-chip benchmark snapped a three-day win streak on Wednesday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) both rose around 0.3%.\n\nThursday's weekly reading on jobless claims — which showed a smaller decline than expected — offered another picture of the labor market after nonfarm-payrolls data showed the US economy added twice as many jobs as anticipated in January.\n\nOn the corporate calendar, earnings from Coinbase (COIN), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Rivian (RIVN) are due after Thursday's closing bell.\n\nThe US saw 227,000 initial jobless claims for the week ended Feb. 7, exceeding expectations and marking a decrease from the previous week's 232,000 initial claims, according to data released Thursday by the Department of Labor.\n\nEconomists had expected 223,000 claims for unemployment benefits, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nContinuing claims for the week came in at 1.86 million, also exceeding economists' estimates of 1.85 million and marking an increase over the previous week's 1.84 million continuing claims.\n\nThe Labor Department data comes after investors received a stronger-than-expected read on payroll additions in January.\n\nData released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed 130,000 jobs added in January, compared to estimates of 65,000 jobs. However, 2025 revisions knocked 400,000 job additions off the year's total, bringing the monthly average of payroll additions to roughly 15,000 per month.\n\nEuropean stocks broadly gained on Thursday as earnings results from Siemens, EssilorLuxxotica, and others lifted sentiment.\n\nGermany's DAX (^GDAXI) rose 1.3%. The index was lifted by a 6% increase in Siemens stock (SIE.DE) after the industrial company raised its 2026 earnings guidance due to strong artificial intelligence demand.\n\nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) advanced another 0.3% after hitting a record high on Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris climbed 1%. Shares of component EssilorLuxxotica (EL.PA), the maker of Ray-Ban and Oakley sunglasses, jumped more than 6% after the company sounded bullish on revenue growth from smart glasses in its earnings report. EssilorLuxxotica expanded its partnership with Meta (META) to produce the AI glasses.\n\nUS healthcare company Baxter's (BAX) stock sank 14% before the bell on Thursday following the release of its fourth quarter earnings, forecasting annual profit below Wall Street estimates. The company cited persistent problems from hurricane-related issues at one of its manufacturing plants.\n\nMagnum Ice Cream's (MICC) stock fell 12% during premarket hours on Thursday. The group, which was recently spun off from Unilever (UL) and makes popular ice creams such as Ben & Jerry's and Cornetto, reported a 3% decline in sales for its fourth quarter earnings.\n\nSanofi (SNY) stock fell 6% before the bell on Thursday after the French pharmaceutical company ousted its CEO, Paul Hudson, thanking him Thursday for \"valuable contributions\" but without giving any reason for his surprise exit.\n\nMicron (MU) stock rose 3% during premarket hours on Thursday after its CEO, brushed off concerns on Wednesday about competition growing in the memory chip space. Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) also claimed an early lead in the race to supply AI chips to Nvidia (NVDA). Samsung Electronics is a key competitor of Micron.\n\nAppLovin (APP) shares fell 5% before the bell today following the group's fourth-quarter earnings release on Wednesday, which beat Wall Street estimates. The advertising company's shares have fallen almost 30% over the past month.\n\nSome smaller pharmaceutical companies not targeted by President Trump for deals to lower their US drug pricing are looking to craft their own agreements with his administration, industry sources told Reuters. The moves are a bid to avoid potentially onerous tariffs and new price-setting schemes.\n\nCisco (CSCO) stock fell 7% during premarket hours on Thursday after the networking company issued guidance below Wall Street forecasts.\n\nFor the full year, Cisco raised its guidance for earnings per share to $3.00 to $3.08 on revenue of $61.2 billion to $61.7 billion. However, the Street was looking for earnings guidance of $3.12 on revenue of $62.1 billion.\n\nIn Cisco's second quarter, the company reported earnings per share of $0.80, compared to Wall Street analyst estimates of $0.74 per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue rose 10% year over year to $15.3 billion, compared to estimates of $15.1 billion.\n\n\"We see strong, broad-based demand for our technology solutions and remain focused on capturing the significant opportunities we see ahead,\" Cisco CFO Mark Patterson said.",

    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nCurrent mortgage rates are relatively low. According to Zillow, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.95%, and the 15-year fixed rate is 5.43% — rates under 6% and 5.5% are exciting milestones. Rates are likely low due to economic factors, including the disappointing job openings report released last week. Inflation data comes out on Friday, and mortgage rates could increase if the report shows that inflation is rising more slowly.\n\nMORE: 6% or less — See which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nMORE: Read about the best mortgage refinance lenders right now.\n\nYou can use the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator below to play around with how different terms and rates will affect your monthly payment. Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders.\n\nToday’s average 30-year mortgage rate is 5.95%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low.\n\nIf you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 5.95% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,789, and you’d pay $344,047 in interest over the life of the loan.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.43% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to compound.\n\nHowever, your monthly payments will be higher because you’re squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.43% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,440. But you’d only pay $139,222 in interest over the life of the loan. That's a sizable savings.\n\nHow much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\n\nWith an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year.\n\nAdjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate will go up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends — that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later.\n\nLately, ARM rates have occasionally been similar to or higher than fixed rates. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nYou can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown is also an option — for example, maybe you get a 6.25% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4.25% for year one, increase to 5.25% for year two, then settle in at 6.25% for the remainder of your term.\n\nJust consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself if you’ll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.\n\nHere are interest rates for some of the most popular mortgage terms: According to Zillow data, the national average 30-year fixed rate is 5.95%, the 15-year fixed rate is 5.43%, and the 5/1 ARM rate is 5.93%.\n\nA normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 5.95%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data. Zillow's rates are usually lower than those reported by Freddie Mac and elsewhere. Each source compiles rates using different methods. Zillow obtains rates from its lender marketplace, and Freddie Mac pulls information from loan applications submitted to its underwriting system. The average might be higher or lower depending on where you live in the U.S. And of course, your credit score.\n\nAccording to January forecasts, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.1% through 2026. Fannie Mae also predicts a 30-year rate near 6% through the end of the year.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nMortgage rates are down, so refinancing soon could be a good idea.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Donald Trump has cast himself as Republicans’ chief messenger on the cost of living in an election year, but a Reuters review of his speeches shows a president repeatedly declaring inflation beaten while rarely acknowledging the strain many Americans say they still feel.\n\nIn five speeches on the economy since December, Trump asserted that inflation had been beaten or was way down almost 20 times and said prices were falling almost 30 times, assertions at odds with economic data and voters' daily experiences. Much of the remaining time was spent on grievances and other issues, including ​immigration, whether Somalia was a country, and attacks on opponents.\n\nTaken together, the speeches portray a president struggling to reconcile his central claim — that he has fixed the cost-of-living crisis — with inflation near 3% over the past year and voters’ lived experience of paying more for grocery staples. The price of ground beef, for example, ‌is up 18% since Trump took office a year ago, while ground coffee prices are up 29%.\n\nRepublican strategists told Reuters that his mixed messaging on the top issue for voters risks creating a credibility gap for him and the Republican Party ahead of the November midterms, when control of Congress will be at stake. Opinion polls show voters are deeply unhappy with Trump's handling of the economy.\n\n\"He can't continue to make claims that are demonstrably ‌false, particularly at the expense of Republicans who are in competitive House districts or Senate races,\" said Rob Godfrey, a Republican strategist. Trump \"must be disciplined and focused,\" he added.\n\nOne source close to the White House said the president needed to hit the issue of affordability harder and through personal visits to critical districts.\n\n\"He needs to bring the message out because the message is not resonating,\" the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity to more freely discuss the issue.\n\nKush Desai, a White House spokesman, said Trump’s focus on illegal immigration in his speeches is directly connected to his argument that people in the country illegally have an adverse impact on the economy. Desai said it causes “public services being overburdened, business activity disrupted by crime, housing markets flooded, and workers’ wages depressed.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly stressed that much work remains to clean up the economic mess he says his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, left him, Desai added.\n\nTRUMP VEERS OFF MESSAGE TO RAIL ABOUT IMMIGRATION\n\nThe Reuters analysis found that Trump - when not declaring inflation beaten - devoted nearly half his speaking time to grievances and other issues.\n\nIn about five hours of speaking time, he spent roughly two hours straying into ⁠about 20 topics unrelated to prices, the Reuters review found. When he veered off message, his top issue was illegal immigration, ‌which he spent a total of about 30 to 40 minutes talking about.\n\nIn the speeches he insulted Somali Americans in Minnesota, who voted against him in the 2024 election. He referred to Somalia as \"not even a country\" - and in four speeches he disparaged Somali-born Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar.\n\nA progressive, high-profile Democrat and Muslim, Omar has been a frequent Trump critic, especially over his immigration policies.\n\n\"Every time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket,\" Omar said last month, the ‍day after a man sprayed a foul-smelling liquid on her at a town hall event.\n\nTrump also talked about men in women's sports, Venezuela, Iran, the Islamic State militant group, Greenland, Ukraine and Russia, military recruitment, his false claim that the 2020 election was rigged, U.S. weaponry, his exaggerated claim to have ended eight wars, and even how much a Fox News anchor likes him.\n\nTRUMP'S MEANDERING WORRIES STRATEGISTS\n\n\"Inflation is stopped. Incomes are up. Prices are down,\" Trump said in an Iowa speech on January 27.\n\nOnly twice in the five speeches did Trump acknowledge that prices are still too high, but he blamed them on Biden. Trump was elected in 2024 because of voter unhappiness with Biden's handling of inflation - which spiked to over 9% in 2022 - and illegal immigration.\n\nDemocrats caused prices \"to be too high,\" Trump told a rally ​in Pennsylvania on December 9. \"But now they're coming down.\"\n\nIn the same speech he called the term \"affordability\" a Democratic \"hoax\". After a public backlash, he has ceased saying that in more recent speeches.\n\nIn four of the speeches Trump repeatedly and haphazardly switches topics, often when he is in the middle of talking about the economy, the Reuters review found.\n\nFour Republican strategists ‌interviewed by Reuters said Trump's meandering style - which he proudly calls \"the weave\" - risked drowning out his core economic argument that he has brought inflation and prices down.\n\nSpeaking to world leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on January 21, Trump spent the first 22 minutes on topic, then suddenly, for the next 22 minutes, insulted Europeans, said they would be speaking German if it wasn’t for America, called NATO ungrateful, and decried the “crooked” media before pivoting back to the U.S. economy.\n\nDoug Heye, a Republican strategist, said voters want to hear what Trump is doing to lower costs. \"But they have no memory of what Trump says about economic issues because of the volume of his own rhetoric.\"\n\nOne source familiar with the White House's thinking said Trump was likely to use his State of the Union address on February 24 as the kickoff for more intense domestic travel to amplify his message on affordability.\n\nFor many Americans, the economy still feels unforgiving. Prices remain high, even though the inflation rate has inched down since Trump took office, from 3% to 2.7%. A lower inflation rate does not mean prices are decreasing - just that they are growing at a slower pace, economists stress.\n\nIn the 12 months through December 2025, food costs were up over 3%, while average hourly earnings were up only 1.1% year over year. The unemployment rate was 4.4% in December, up from 4% when Trump took office in January 2025, according to government data.\n\nIn ⁠some of the speeches Trump correctly identifies a drop in prices for a few everyday goods, including eggs and gas. The cost of eggs fell about 21% in December from a year earlier after ​being 60% higher during Trump's first months back in office. Gas prices are about 4% lower since January last year.\n\nBut the cost of an average grocery basket has risen. The price of coffee, beef, and some fruits, ​among other items, has risen in the past year.\n\nTrump does offer solutions in his speeches, including his tax cuts that kicked in last month that will produce greater savings for tens of millions of families; the scrapping of taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security payments; his plan to reduce mortgage interest rates; a proposal to lower housing prices; and deals with health insurance companies to reduce drug prices.\n\nMost economists expect U.S. households and the economy at large to benefit in the months ahead from the tax cuts. But Trump's more recent proposals are unlikely to have a ‍significant impact on the cost of living between now and November, some economists told Reuters. One ⁠of Trump's ideas - to cap credit card interest rates to 10% for a year - could even backfire since it could limit access to credit for lower-income families, some economists have warned.\n\nMike Marinella, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, which supports candidates for the House of Representatives, said Trump and Republicans were helping working families. \"Voters are seeing this clear contrast, and the best is yet to come.\"\n\nSome 35% of Americans approve of Trump's overall handling of the economy, according to a January 25 Reuters/Ipsos poll, up slightly from 33% in December. But it is well below his initial 42% rating on the issue when he first took office a year ago.\n\nFormer economic officials in previous administrations say Trump is falling into the same trap Biden did in 2024 when confronted with persistently high inflation.\n\nBiden kept claiming the U.S. economy was strong and urged voters to look at other economic data. That strategy failed badly and Democrats were punished at the polls.\n\nThe officials agreed it was important for presidents to show voters they understood their economic pain, especially in an election year.\n\n\"We ‌definitely talked past people on inflation,\" Jared Bernstein, the head of Biden's Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview.\n\n\"What we typically did was to say, 'A new report just came out on jobs, it's very strong,' and that was all true. But the fact is that there wasn't much we were ‌able to do in terms of the price level.\"",

    "description": "Some Wall Street banks are betting the US economy is going to run hot in 2026. But David Kelly thinks things will be a little chillier than expected.",
    "fullText": "Some Wall Street banks are betting the US economy is going to run hot in the months and years ahead, predicting a stretch of high growth and hot inflation.\n\nBut David Kelly, the chief global strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, thinks things will be a little chillier than most are expecting.\n\nIn an interview with Business Insider this week, Kelly said that by the fourth quarter of this year, he expects to see both GDP growth and inflation under 2%. Given that the economy grew 4.3% in the third quarter last year and inflation was 2.7% in December, that might sound surprising.\n\nKelly's reasoning? Immigration numbers are falling, and that will eventually weigh on the labor pool and consumer demand.\n\n\"We're getting stimulus right now from income tax refunds, we may get some stimulus from tariff rebate checks, but all that's gonna fade in the fourth quarter of this year, and the economy really can't grow more than about 1.5% per year without some change in immigration numbers,\" Kelly said. \"I think that could allow for some more rate cuts in 2027 in a sort of soggier economy.\"\n\nHe pointed to January Census Bureau data that the agency said showed a \"historic decline in net international migration.\"\n\n\"I think a report that didn't get enough prominence last week was the Census Bureau report, which showed not so much what immigration did over the last year or the year that ended in July of 2025, but what they think is going on right now,\" Kelly said.\n\n\"Right now, they think that annual immigration to the United States is down to 321,000. If that's right, the working age population age 18 to 64, is falling by 20,000 people per month.\"\n\nGiven these numbers, Kelly said he's leaning away from parts of the market that could be sensitive to population declines, such as consumer staples and housing.\n\n\"I'd be a little cautious about consumer staples here,\" he said. \"I saw a large consumer staples company blaming some poor results on consumer worries or consumer income. It's not consumer worries or consumer income, it's a lack of consumers.\"\n\nKelly said investors are best off increasing their exposure to international stocks right now. While ex-US stocks have outperformed in the last year, they still have have cheap valuations relative to US stocks, he said. Plus, US investors are still historically under-indexed on international due to the long-run outperformance of US stocks in recent decades.\n\n\"Ask yourself one question: Where is there an embedded prejudice within markets?\" Kelly said. \"Where is there something where people almost irrationally hate something or irrationally love something?\"\n\n\"We saw this, after the tech meltdown after the dot com bubble burst. We saw that with financials in 2009,\" he continued. \"Well, today, what do people really hate? People hate international. US investors hate international.\"\n\nKelly said that it didn't necessarily matter which regions or countries outside the US to invest in, but to simply add exposure. Examples of funds that offer exposure to international stocks include the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF (VEU) and the iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF (IXUS).\n\nOutside of stocks, Kelly said he prefers municipal bonds over corporate credit because of the relative tax savings. In alternative assets, which are historically uncorrelated to stock movements, Kelly prefers the real estate, infrastructure, and global transportation themes.",

    "title": "'Bond King' Jeff Gundlach lays out his investing playbook as he eyes high inflation and a weaker dollar",
    "description": "Jeffrey Gundlach said one of his top recommendations is to invest in non-US stocks in non-dollar currencies.",
    "fullText": "The Bond King is steering clear of the US.\n\nThat's one of the prevailing themes that defines Jeff Gundlach's latest investing playbook, the famed fixed-income investor said.\n\nIn an appearance on CNBC on Wednesday, the DoubleLine Capital CEO pointed to two risks in particular that were swaying his macro outlook:\n\nHigher inflation. Inflation is running at about a 3% annualize rate, above the Fed's 2% target. While that difference sounds small, Gundlach estimates that it translates into a 56% increase in consumer prices of a 15-year period, much higher than a 2% rate.\n\nIf the Fed were to cut interest rates below the rate of inflation, that could potentially cause price growth to run even hotter, he said, referring to concern in markets that the Fed could give into political pressure and cut rates prematurely.\n\nA weaker US dollar. The greenback isn't acting like a safe-haven asset for investors anymore, and it hasn't been for a while, Gundlach said, pointing to recent selling pressure in dollar-denominated assets.\n\nThe US Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, has declined around 10% over the past year, a possible sign that investors are losing some confidence in dollar-based assets as a whole.\n\n\"My central investment theme now for about two years has been center your portfolio positioning around the idea that the dollar is going to be secularly weak,\" Gundlach said. \"If you slash interest rates, then you're not only running a weaker dollar policy, but you're running an inflationary policy,\" he later added.\n\nWith those risks in mind, Gundlach said these were the areas he believed investors should consider.\n\nGundlach said one of his top recommendations was for people to invest in non-US markets in local currency, particularly in emerging markets. He advised investors to have 30%-40% of their portfolio in foreign stocks and avoid US stocks completely.\n\n\"I know this is risky for dollar-based investors, but I have conviction on this,\" Gundlach said of his recommendation. \"I think that's going to continue to be a winning trade.\"\n\nEmerging markets have outpaced the gains in the US market over the last year. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF is up 42% in 12 months, compared to the 15% gain in the S&P 500.\n\nGundlach said he's still a big fan of bonds — but on the short-end in particular.\n\nThe risk associated with those bonds doesn't seem to be substantial at the moment, Gundlach said, speculating that much of the risk in the public bond market had been absorbed by the private credit market.\n\n\"I still like what's performed well — bonds did well last year,\" Gundlach said, though he later added he felt bearish on long-end bonds. Long-end bond yields have climbed higher in recent years as concerns have swirled around inflation and rising deficits in the US, two issues that have been front-of-mind for Gundlach.\n\nMetals like gold and silver could be good shelter assets for investors, particularly since the US dollar is no longer acting like a safe-haven, Gundlach said.\n\n\"Less than one month of 2026, what's outperforming? It's the precious metals, it's commodities, \" he said, pointing to the rallies that have carried gold, silver, and copper higher in recent months.\n\nHe added that investors seem to be more interested in hard assets, he said, a trend Gundlach said he believed would continue to accelerate over time.\n\n\"It's already well underway and that train just keeps on rolling,\" he added.\n\nGold and silver are still seeing their strongest gains in decades. Bullion is up 99% over the past year, while silver is up a staggering 284%.",

    "fullText": "Gold and silver prices have soared in the midst of global geopolitical uncertainty, concerns about the global role of the dollar, long-simmering inflation and general economic uncertainty.\n\nRegular readers of my column know that I have always advised keeping a portion of your assets in gold and gold mining shares or mutual funds. (Search my columns at TerrySavage.com using the key word “gold” and going back more than a decade.) But with today’s huge rise in gold prices, those investments have significantly increased in value, almost demanding that you evaluate your long-term positions.\n\nSome economic background is in order. CME Group Chief Economist Erik Norland has written a definitive guide to the economic forces moving the precious metals markets. He notes: “Gold ... is up 80% as of January 21. Palladium is up 105%, platinum up 175% and silver prices have tripled, rising 212%.” (That appreciation figure has since changed. You can read the entire report, including graphics, at the CME Group website.)\n\nIn an interview I asked about the dramatic rise in the price of gold. Norland explained there are five main drivers of demand:\n\nIt’s not just the United States that is running a budget deficit — currently 6% of GDP, without accounting for proposed increases in military spending. Norland notes that European nations are currently increasing their defense spending allocations, as is Canada. The Japanese have always had a huge public debt as a percentage of GDP, and now even China’s public debt is running at 8.5% of GDP. The implication is that all that spending will generate a new round of “money printing” — i.e., inflation.\n\nThe key ingredient of Norland’s outlook is the fact that inflation is just barely under control around the world, running above targets set by all central banks. In the United States, for example, the latest report of the Fed’s preferred inflation indicator (PCE) came in at 2.8% — well above the Fed’s 2% target.\n\nNorland notes that despite the underlying inflationary pressures, almost every central bank is in the process of lowering interest rates. That’s the opposite of what central banks usually do to fight inflation. The exceptions are Japan, which already has such very low rates, and Brazil.\n\n—Perceived erosion of central bank independence\n\nFor nearly 80 years, central banks have “managed” currencies through interest rates and currency purchases or interventions. Their role has been to manage the balance of currencies needed for stability and world trade. But it’s not just the U.S. Federal Reserve bank that is feeling pressure to bend to political will. It’s happening around the world.",

    "description": "Geopolitical tensions, Trump's tariff threats, and inflation fears have helped propel gold to $5,000 for the first time ever on Monday.",
    "fullText": "Gold is surging yet again, with the metal touching $5,000 an ounce on Monday for the first time ever.\n\nBehind the latest rally is the familiar cocktail of tailwinds that are bullish for gold, but less so for other parts of the market and the economy. The \"sell America\" trade is still getting a boost, inflationary concerns linger, and fears about geopolitical crises continue to percolate.\n\nHere are the latest updates on what's driving gold's parabolic rally to all-time highs.\n\nGold jumped more than 2% on Monday as trade tensions roil markets once again after Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Canada if it strikes any sort of trade agreement with China.\n\n\"If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social over the weekend.\n\nGold tends to play a \"flight-to-safety\" role in markets. When investors get scared about the economic consequences of Trump upending trade with key allies, they've often flocked to the metal for shelter.\n\nThe threatening rhetoric against allies like Canada and last week's sabre-rattling from Trump about taking over Greenland sparked a return of the \"Sell America\" trade, which has boosted gold over the last year.\n\nAs gold spiked to fresh highs on Monday, the dollar index fell almost 1% against major rivals to about $96.96.\n\nOccupying a similar place in investors' minds to \"Sell America\" is the debasement trade, which continues to boost metals like gold as markets fret about other safe havens such as Treasurys.\n\nGold bulls say that a weakening of the US dollar and other fiat currencies as governments pursue aggressive fiscal policies will boost more stable stores of value.\n\nTrump's ongoing pressure campaign against the Fed and Jerome Powell has been the latest update that has investors fretting over currency debasement and flocking to gold. The thinking is that political meddling with monetary policy and a dovish new Fed chair could lead to lower interest rates and spur a new period of inflation down the road. Gold has long been considered a hedge against rising prices among investors.\n\nThe debasement trade was a dominant theme in markets in 2025, and analysts have eyed it as a driver of bullish forecasts for 2026.\n\nAccording to Ben McMillan, the CIO at IDX advisors, arguably the biggest driver in gold's outperformance over the last few years has been global central bank buying.\n\n\"After COVID, when America printed all this money, central banks — and it was led by China — quite literally doubled their annual purchases of gold, and they were selling Treasurys to do so,\" McMillan told Business Insider.\n\nCentral banks have also been trying to diversify their holdings away from US dollars, a trend that accelerated after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That prompted the US to freeze Russia's dollar reserves, drawing criticism over \"weaponization\" of the dollar and sparking more gold buying from countries like China.\n\nHeightened uncertainty is the heart of gold's bull case for many investors, and the geopolitical outlook looks shakier than it has in a long time.\n\nFrom Trump's moves in Venezuela, the ongoing war in Ukraine, turmoil in Iran, and a strained NATO alliance, gold bugs have a lot to worry about these days. As current conflicts stretch into 2026, analysts say they expect gold's safe-haven status to keep surging.\n\nFinally, the fear of missing out on a meme-like rally might be behind some of the moves. Gold is up 87% since the start of 2025, and has spiked 25% since October.\n\nThe gains are too good for some to watch from the sidelines.\n\nAs Business Insider reported, retail traders have been pouring money into gold recently, egged on by talk of the \"Sell America\" trade and an endless parade of bulls who say precious metals will keep rising.\n\nSilver is up even more than gold in the last year, and market pros told Business Insider that they worry the flight to safety itself has become a major investment bubble that could end badly for investors chasing the rally.",

    "fullText": "The stock market is flashing an inflation warning signal in the first few weeks of 2026 that could mean investors are in for an ugly year ahead.\n\nThat's according to Tom Essaye, the founder of Sevens Report Research, who warned in a note on Friday of a potential 2022-style rout for the traditional 60/40 portfolio.\n\nEssaye pointed out that both energy and materials stocks are surging since the start of the year, rising by more than 9%. That far outpaces the S&P 500's gain of about 1%. Both sectors of the market can be leading indicators of inflation because prices for energy and materials trickle down to costs in other parts of the economy.\n\n\"Energy is obviously a critical input to inflation metrics as oil and gas prices impact every aspect of global trade, travel and logistics. Materials are a lesser discussed, but equally important factor affecting input costs, which inherently add upside pressure to inflation. And the strong YTD performance by these two sectors is not something to ignore as we continue through Q1.\"\n\nHe added: \"Not many analysts have been discussing such a risk, but it is one to keep tabs on.\"\n\nInflation is relatively tame for now, with the Consumer Price Index hitting 2.7% year-over-year in December. That's above the Federal Reserve's target of 2%, but well off of highs seen in 2022, when spiraling prices sparked an aggressive cycle of Fed rate hikes and caused the S&P 500 to dive 25%.\n\nBut the strong materials and energy price action also comes alongside a broader shift from growth to value, and away from mega-cap stocks to small-caps and transportation stocks — warning signs that trouble could lie ahead, Essaye said. He highlighted the sudden outperformance in the S&P 500 equal-weight index, the Russell 2000 index, and the Vanguard Value Index.\n\n\"There has been a widely discussed rotation taking shape away from mega-cap tech, which led markets higher into late 2025, and to the 'rest of the market,'\" Essaye wrote.\n\n\"Those early year money flows are a noteworthy concern, as they are reminiscent of the start to 2022, a year that proved to be one of the most painful for traditional '60/40' equity/bond investors in the last century,\" he continued. \"This is a dynamic that could potentially be poised to repeat itself in 2026, and the YTD sector performance is adding to those concerns.\"\n\nAt the moment, markets widely expect inflation to remain relatively subdued in 2026, pricing in two Fed rate cuts.\n\nAt least one Wall Street bank — JPMorgan — has warned those expectations may be misplaced. The bank made waves earlier this month when it said it sees no rate cuts in 2026, and predicted that the Fed's next interest-rate adjustment would be a hike in 2027.",

This data was delayed due to the US government shutdown in late 2025.\n\nYahoo Finance Senior Fed Reporter Jennifer Schonberger analyzes the fresh data print.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts.\n\nPCE data for November crossing the wire. Let's send it over to Yahoo Finance's Fed correspondent Jennifer Schonberger to break down the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. Jen?\n\nHey there, Julia. Yep, crossing the wires right now. Personal consumption expenditures index on a core basis, clocking in year-over-year at 2.8%, month over month up two-10ths of a percent. That is right in line with expectations.\n\nNow, recall that this is a number that is delayed because of the government shutdown. And so the Bureau of Economic Analysis also had to do a bit of gymnastics to back into this number because it is combined for October and November, and for portions of October, they had to use the average of September and November figures.\n\nSo, we should probably take this with a little bit of a grain of salt as we did for other data measures for October and November previously. Having said that, 2.8%, it's uh closer to 3% than the Fed's 2% inflation goal and sitting right where it was at the beginning of the fall in September.\n\nSo, this certainly doesn't change the course for the Fed's meeting next Wednesday. And if anything, I think it solidifies it because you had the unemployment rate drop in December to 4.4%. There's really no reason for the Fed to cut at this point, especially given the three rate cuts that they did at the tail end of last year.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump wrapped up his first year in his second term. Here's how inflation, the job market, tariffs, and spending have evolved.",
    "fullText": "The US experienced the smallest job growth outside a recession since 2003 last year, adding just 584,000 jobs.\n\nDraho said overall policy uncertainty, tariffs, immigration, and fears of a recession from months ago have been factors.\n\n\"It's made companies a little more reluctant to invest, to hire, if you're not sure how much of an overall economic drag that tariffs would have,\" Draho said about overall uncertainty. \"So even if your company may not be directly affected by tariffs, just the uncertainty of how this could play out would be a bit of a negative.\"\n\nEconomists and job-market experts have said that the slower job market is unsustainable. Renter said it could affect consumer spending if it doesn't reverse course.\n\n\"How we feel about our income plays a big role in how we spend, and I think the longer this uncertainty and the longer this labor market chill sort of sits over us, the more that a greater number of households are going to start tightening their purse strings,\" Renter said.\n\nGregory Daco, the chief economist at EY, said the economy is showing resilience despite a jobless expansion.\n\n\"That's been really the key defining factor of the US economy in the face of a number of cross-currents, from significant shifts in trade policy and tariffs to industrial policy, to significant shifts in immigration dynamics, to now an AI-led technological revolution,\" he said.\n\nReal GDP grew in the second and third quarters of 2025 after falling in the first, as businesses prepared for new tariffs.\n\nWhile economic growth has been strong, Daco thinks a jobless boom will continue because an aging population and a drop in net migration are affecting the supply of workers at the same time as less demand for new workers.\n\n\"Businesses are very cautious as to who they hire and at what rate they hire because they don't necessarily need as much talent as they did a year or two years ago,\" Daco said.\n\nOne of the Trump administration's goals was to increase efficiency within the federal government. That led to several actions to shrink the workforce, including reduction-in-force and buyouts led by the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics data showed a massive drop in federal employment in October because people who had taken deferred resignations officially came off the government payrolls.\n\nCameron Hilaker, an AFGE Local 1534 member, was an emergency manager for US Agency for International Development before being laid off last spring. He is still looking for work and has become a stay-at-home dad. Without his government paycheck, Hilaker and his wife can't comfortably afford childcare for their new baby.\n\n\"We were fully unprepared for this,\" Hilaker said. \"All of a sudden, I am at home with my son because we're not paying daycare. We can't afford another $2,500 a month expense. Budgets are tight.\"\n\nThe manufacturing sector continued its trend of job losses or weak job growth that had been underway before Trump took office.\n\n\"Part of the justification for tariffs was bringing manufacturing back to the US,\" Renter said, adding it would be costly and could take years to do that, \"if even possible.\"\n\nShe added that tariffs have likely had a negative effect on the sector, with manufacturing firms that rely on imports taking a hit.\n\n\"The Fed's industrial production measure is now at its highest level since 2019, clearly reversing its Biden era decline,\" Desai said. \"Meanwhile, core capital goods shipments have hit an all-time high under President Trump, signaling strong investment into future manufacturing production and jobs.\"\n\nA blog post from the St. Louis Fed showed that the effective import tariff rate and tariff revenue as a share of gross domestic product have spiked.\n\n\"Both rates jumped noticeably in 2018 during the first trade war, more or less doubling by 2022,\" the blog post said.\n\nThere has been a lot of back-and-forth on tariffs. The administration has announced tariffs on different goods, including some wines, cars, and furniture. Some tariffs are no longer in effect or pushed back — tariffs on coffee, spices, beef, and more were stopped in November. The Supreme Court is also expected to rule on the legality of many of the tariffs soon.\n\nThe inflation rate has cooled down a lot since it surged to about 9% in 2022, but it remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. In 2025, it slowed in the first few months before speeding up and then holding steady in December.\n\nDraho said the inflation rate climbed higher than expected, with tariffs having a small effect.\n\n\"I knew retailers and producers would be reluctant to pass along cost increases to consumers. I didn't imagine that they would be able to hold the line for quite so long,\" Renter said.\n\nRenter believes tariffs will continue to affect inflation because they are affecting a variety of items, so their effect is trickling in instead of causing a one-time increase in prices. \"It's tough, really, to know how much of the spikes in price growth can be attributed to tariffs and how much might be attributed to other issues like supply chain issues, demand-driven issues, which makes monetary policy a little more difficult,\" she said.\n\nDespite economic uncertainty, spending has been strong. However, like much else in the economy, consumer spending has taken on a \"K-shape,\" where wealthier people are spending big while lower-income Americans are cutting back. Draho said this is likely more of a structural pattern that existed before Trump's term.\n\n\"Much of the robust spending that we've seen over the past year has been driven primarily by people with assets and people with high incomes,\" Renter said. \"If you're invested in the stock market, you're probably doing pretty well right now. If you own your home, and especially if you have owned your home for more than a handful of years, you're probably feeling pretty secure right now. And I think the bulk of the spending has been coming from these groups of people.\"",

    "fullText": "The US ended 2025 with a lower inflation rate, but it was still far above the Federal Reserve's target.\n\nThe year-over-year inflation rate was 2.7% in December, the same as the forecast and November's increase, and down from the 2.9% a year ago.\n\nAfter most October year-over-year figures couldn't be calculated because of data collection issues during the government shutdown, the new report brings a little more clarity to how quickly prices have changed in the last few months of the year.\n\nCore CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.6% from a year ago, just below the 2.7% forecast and matching November's 2.6% increase.\n\nBoth overall and core CPI were expected to rise 0.3% over the month. Headline CPI matched that expected 0.3% increase, holding steady from September, the last month with an available change. Core CPI increased 0.2%, as it did in September.\n\n\"Economists were worried about some statistical resets after the government shutdown, but the bigger disinflation trend continued,\" David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation, said. \"Cars and energy saved the day even as shelter ticked back up.\"\n\nThe food index increased 3.1% from a year ago in December, higher than November's 2.6%. Steaks, in particular, rose 17.8% over the year, the largest since December 2021. Eggs fell 20.9% from a year ago.\n\nThere were a few record year-over-year increases. Subscription and rental of video and video games, non-electric cookware and tableware, and tenants' and household insurance had the largest increases on record. Meanwhile, moving, storage, and freight expenses fell the most year-over-year on record.\n\nLast Friday's jobs report also indicated how the economy has changed in 2025. The US added 584,000 jobs in 2025, a cooldown from job growth over the previous few years. Unemployment remained low in December but was higher than a year ago.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will be able to use these economic reports to make its interest rate decision. Economists and traders expect Federal Open Market Committee members, who will meet January 27 and January 28, to hold interest rates steady after three straight cuts before 2025 ended.\n\nCME FedWatch indicated a 95% chance after the CPI report that the Fed would hold interest rates steady.\n\nThe next few months are set to bring big changes to the Fed. Jerome Powell's term as Federal Reserve Chair ends in May, and his term on the Board of Governors ends in 2028. On Sunday, Powell said the Department of Justice served the Fed with grand jury subpoenas, which are related to testimony Powell gave last June about renovations to Fed buildings. International central bankers said they \"stand in full solidarity\" with the Fed and Powell.\n\n\"I have served at the Federal Reserve under four administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike,\" Powell said in a video statement. \"In every case, I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment.\"\n\nThis is a developing story.

    "description": "Why the old formula is no longer holding up.",
    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nFor decades, the classic 60/40 portfolio — 60% stocks and 40% bonds — served as the cornerstone of balanced investing. The idea was simple: When stocks stumbled, bonds would steady the ship.\n\nBut according to economist Peter Schiff, that old formula no longer holds up. Inflation, he warns, has torn apart one side of the traditional mix, leaving investors exposed to painful consequences.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\n“Bonds are clearly the biggest victims of inflation. If you own bonds, inflation kills you. There is no hedge,” Schiff said in a YouTube video from October 2025 (1).\n\nBut, on Dec. 22, Wells Fargo reported that the yield on 10-year bonds increased 0.03% while 30-year bonds saw a 0.02% uptick (2). This follows the BLS reporting lower inflation rates than expected on Dec. 18, in their first report on the Consumer Price Index since the government shutdown in October and November (3).\n\nBonds are particularly vulnerable when price levels rise. Their fixed payments don’t adjust for inflation, meaning investors are repaid in dollars that buy less and less over time.\n\nMeanwhile, higher inflation often pushes interest rates up — and as rates rise, the market value of existing bonds falls because new issues offer better yields. That double blow — shrinking purchasing power and falling prices — can leave existing bondholders with real losses even as they collect “safe” interest payments.\n\nThat’s a serious concern because bonds remain a core holding in many Americans’ portfolios, especially retirement accounts. For retirees and near-retirees counting on those holdings to preserve purchasing power, inflation can quietly erode wealth — even when markets appear calm. If inflation spikes again, many Americans could see their portfolios become compromised.\n\nTo address that problem, a major Wall Street firm is giving the traditional 60/40 mix a modern upgrade.\n\nSchiff pointed out that Morgan Stanley is leading the rethink. Instead of 60% stocks and 40% bonds, Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson now favors 60% stocks, 20% fixed income and 20% gold.",

    "description": "The country is in an unusual economic moment, with a weakening labor market and above-target inflation levels. Those factors are keeping mortgage rates from moving much.",
    "fullText": "For weeks now, mortgage rates have barely budged. There’s a good chance they won’t move much in the new year either.\n\nMortgage rates have hovered in a remarkably narrow range of 6.2% to 6.3%, roughly year-to-date lows, since mid-September. Those levels have been enticing enough to spark some gains in refinancing activity and homebuying in the fall, but are still elevated enough to keep many aspiring buyers priced out of the market.\n\nThe recent stability at relatively high levels can be explained by the country’s unusual economic moment — the labor market is weakening, but inflation remains relatively high — combined with government shutdown disruptions that have made it harder to parse where those trends are headed. A number of economic reports that typically influence mortgage rates were delayed, canceled, or only partially released since the shutdown, giving rates few catalysts to move much either way.\n\n“The shutdown just blurred everything,” said Hector Amendola, president of Panorama Mortgage Group in Las Vegas. “I think everyone’s on the edge of their seat for January numbers to see how the trend looks and where it’s going to go.”\n\nFactors including future Federal Reserve actions, trends in government bond yields, and demand for mortgage-backed securities help determine mortgage rates. But on a basic level, mortgage rates are usually lower when the labor market is weaker and inflation is minimal and higher when the opposite is true.\n\nIn recent months, the Federal Reserve has been cutting benchmark interest rates amid signs that the labor market is slowing. But it has been doing so at a time when inflation has been running higher than its 2% target, and the members of the rate-setting committee have signaled that they’re divided over the future direction of interest rates.\n\nThat mixed economic and policy backdrop is part of the reason most economists and industry professionals expect only minor fluctuations in rates next year. The Mortgage Bankers Association sees mortgage rates stuck in a narrow range between 6% and 6.5% “over the next few years.” Similarly, economists at Realtor.com and Redfin expect mortgage rates to average 6.3% — near current levels — in 2026, while the National Association of Realtors and Fannie Mae see a slightly bigger dip, to around 6%, by the end of next year.\n\n“I don’t think they’re going to drop substantially, unless something big happens in the economy one way or another,” said Melissa Abramovich, a loan officer at A+ Mortgage Services in Muskego, Wis.\n\nAnd what the Fed does ultimately has only an indirect effect on mortgage rates. In most scenarios, including this year, mortgage rates begin to drift lower before the Fed begins cutting interest rates. Over the summer, mortgage rates dropped from the high 6% range to the low 6% range, and then barely reacted when the Fed delivered three rate drops at its September, October, and December meetings.",

    "description": "President Trump’s trade policy, inflation and climbing stock prices shaped business and the economy this year.",
    "fullText": "In recent years, macroeconomic tides have ebbed and flowed, but one thing has remained unchanged: Americans’ dim views of the economy.\n\nIn 2023, pundits warned of the “vibecession.” In 2024, concerns about the economy and inflation were top of mind for voters in the presidential race.\n\nThis year, economic pessimism has persisted, as President Trump’s sweeping economic proposals, from his wide-ranging tariffs to his plan to remake the Federal Reserve, have raised uncertainty to new highs. And the economic data is sending mixed, and muddled, signals.\n\nHere are 14 charts that illustrate how uncertainty has unfolded in the economy and markets over the last year, and how it might affect the next.\n\nPresident Trump’s trade war has been one of the biggest sources of economic uncertainty this year. During his campaign, Trump repeatedly cited tariffs as a way to spur American manufacturing, create new jobs and lower U.S. trade deficits.\n\nNearly every country has seen import duties rise.\n\nThe tariffs have made progress toward some of the administration’s stated goals: They have brought the trade deficit down, as exports grew more than imports.\n\nAnd they have made money: Tariff revenues are now at record highs.\n\nBut there is another kind of deficit on investors’ minds: the federal budget deficit. Tariff revenues remain a small share of total government revenues.\n\nHere’s another way in which the effects of tariffs are showing up: higher prices for goods.\n\nConsumer prices started to accelerate in June, and the prices of products most exposed to tariffs notched some of the highest gains.\n\nAnd in recent months, prices for goods continued to rise, contributing more to inflation.\n\nInflation unexpectedly slowed to 2.7 percent in November, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics this week. But economists have advised taking this data with a grain of salt, because of disruptions in the bureau’s data collection efforts during the 43-day federal government shutdown.\n\nIt’s still unclear whether tariffs will cause just a temporary increase in prices or if they will feed into more persistent inflation.\n\nAt this month’s DealBook Summit, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pushed back against the notion that tariffs had contributed to inflation, saying that they had caused a “one-time price adjustment,” not a “generalized price increase.”\n\nThe chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, has also said that the Fed expected tariffs to cause a “one-time shift in the price level.” But he has stressed that the increase could be drawn out over several quarters. And at a news conference after last week’s Fed meeting he acknowledged the risk of tariff inflation becoming “more and more persistent.”\n\nIn the first full jobs report since the federal shutdown, the B.L.S. reported that the unemployment rate rose to 4.6 percent last month, a four-year high. Wage growth slowed to its lowest level since 2021. As with inflation, the shutdown affected the data collection for these measures, and the agency said ahead of the release that its estimates of the unemployment rate and other measures would be subject to more uncertainty than usual.\n\nThe average job gain over the last three months\n\nThe average job gain over the last three months\n\nThere was a silver lining: Employers added 64,000 jobs in November, driven largely by gains in the health care sector. But that only partly offset a decline in October.\n\nThe federal government shed 168,000 jobs in October and November, as workers who accepted the Trump administration’s “deferred resignation” offer came off the payroll.\n\nAnd the jobs numbers do not reflect a big downward revision that is expected early next year.\n\n(Revisions to jobs figures are commonplace, but they dominated headlines earlier this year when downward adjustments led Trump to fire the commissioner of the B.L.S., Erika McEntarfer, claiming, without evidence, that the data was “rigged.”)\n\nThe lowest-paid workers have felt the strain of the cooling labor market the most. As the economy started to recover from the pandemic, demand for labor far outstripped supply in the lowest-paid industries, such as leisure and hospitality.\n\nToday, that is no longer the case, and hourly wages are rising most slowly for the lowest earners.\n\nLast year, voters consistently told pollsters that they trusted Donald Trump over Joe Biden and later, Kamala Harris, to do a better job on the economy.\n\nNow, Trump is the one feeling the pressure, as views of his handling of the economy have soured since the summer.\n\nThe risks posed by inflation and a softening labor market have also put the Fed in a tough position. Last week, the central bank decided to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point for a third meeting in a row. But the decision was highly contentious, with three of 12 policymakers voting against it.\n\nPowell said he could have made the case either way for the Fed to cut interest rates or pause reductions, given the competing risks to unemployment and inflation.\n\n“You’ve got one tool,” he said. “You can’t do two things at once.”\n\nTrump, for his part, has made no secret of his desire for lower rates. Next year, he will select a new Fed chair.\n\nAfter a dip earlier this year, most notably amid the chaotic “Liberation Day” tariff rollout, the stock market has, on the whole, kept on going up. The S&P 500 reached a record high just last week, for the 37th time this year.\n\nArguably, company earnings, and their expectations for earnings are the most important factor driving the market movements.\n\nIn fact, earnings expectations have moved in tandem with the S&P 500 price index over the course of this year (again, with the exception of the early months of the year).\n\nOf course, the S&P 500 is driven in large part by big tech companies, which are intertwined with the A.I. boom.\n\nThat has been cause for concern for some investors, who see a parallel between this moment and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s. But unlike companies leading the stock rally during the dot-com bubble, the public companies with the steepest valuation gains today are earning more as the market goes up.\n\nThe outlook for earnings continues to be bullish in 2026, though there could be weak links in the A.I. chain.\n\nThe crypto boom that Trump’s re-election ushered in is on pause for now.\n\nAfter surging for most of the year, the price of Bitcoin and Ether, along with dozens of other coins, started to plummet on Oct. 10, following Trump’s announcement that he would impose a new tariff on China.\n\n(The stock market on that day also saw the biggest one-day plunge since April, though it has since rebounded and hit a record high.)\n\nFor some, the crypto sell-off has underscored the fact that crypto remains a volatile investment, even as it has entered a new level of mainstream acceptance. Amid a high-stakes lobbying campaign by the crypto industry, Trump ended a regulatory crackdown on crypto and signed legislation outlining the first federal rules for stablecoins, digital tokens tied to assets like the U.S. dollar.\n\nOthers worry that a crypto crash could bleed over to the wider market.\n\nAmid all this uncertainty, people might be looking to pop culture as a form of escape. They haven’t necessarily been finding it at the movies, if ticket sales are any indication.\n\nSummer is a crucial season for Hollywood, accounting for the lion’s share of annual box office revenue. This year, fantasies, science-fiction sequels and superhero flicks were on offer. But moviegoers, for the most part, didn’t bite: It was the worst summer for domestic ticket sales since 1981, after adjusting for inflation and excluding the pandemic years.\n\nThe fall was filled with star-studded flicks, but none of them constituted box office hits.\n\nCan the holiday season help Hollywood make a comeback? “Zootopia 2” and “Wicked: For Good” have gotten it off to a good start.\n\nBut broader concerns abound. Warner Bros. Discovery has struck a deal with Netflix for the Warner Bros. studio and its sibling streaming service, HBO Max, while it has fended off, for the time being, a hostile takeover offer from Paramount.\n\nRegardless of how it all ends, it feels like a moment of loss for cinephiles. Corporate consolidation, after all, is not likely to bode well for the future of the Silver Screen.",

    "title": "Sitting on cash for 2026? Why experts say the 'safe' option could be your biggest risk",
    "description": "Canadian financial advisers say the risks of sitting on the sidelines — from missed returns to inflation — may be higher than investors expect.",
    "fullText": "After a year of uncertainty and volatility, with U.S. tariffs dominating headlines and regular invocations of an “AI bubble,” the temptation may exist to seek safety in cash. But experts say the same investing rules apply as always, even with AI stocks’ path still erratic and further trade bumps likely ahead in 2026.\n\n“The single best way to avoid getting ruined from a market downturn is not to expose yourself to more risk than you can tolerate in the first place,” said Jason Pereira, a senior partner and financial planner at Woodgate Financial.\n\n“I'm not saying don't invest — I'm absolutely saying invest. But the investment decision is not between 'cash' and 'stock.' That is a fallacy.”\n\nIf anxiety about markets is rising, it isn’t clearly showing up in how Canadian investors are behaving. In an email to Yahoo Finance Canada, Frances Horodelski, who has held senior roles in Canada's investment industry for decades, says she is not seeing a broad move into cash despite persistent headlines about volatility, geopolitics, and stretched valuations.\n\n“I wouldn’t put too much stock in people claiming to want cash due to economic uncertainty here,” she said, describing investor behaviour in many cases as leaning more towards “all in.” That posture also aligns more closely with market reality. While Canadian economic sentiment remains dour, the TSX has quietly held up, with roughly 80 per cent of its components positive year-to-date and strength spread across banks, industrials, and consumer names such as Aritzia, Saputo, and Bombardier.\n\nPereira says the gap between perception and reality often comes down to a misunderstanding of volatility itself. Market swings feel destabilizing, but they are not evidence that something is broken. “Volatility is the price you pay for long-term returns in the market,” he said. “Not everybody’s willing to pay that price.” Avoiding volatility entirely, he adds, doesn’t eliminate risk so much as shift it, increasing the odds that investors miss returns when markets move ahead of sentiment.\n\nWhen investors do hold cash, Horodelski and Pereira both suggest it is usually functional — money parked for liquidity or imminent purchases rather than a strategic bet against the market. “Generally speaking, I don't believe investors use cash as an asset class or store of value but as a placeholder for future spending plans,” Horodelski noted.\n\nThat distinction is critical in the current Canadian landscape, where the safety of a savings account could come with a real loss. While U.S. investors have enjoyed higher yields on cash-like instruments, Horodelski notes that Canadian returns are “not particularly attractive for cash.” With one-year GICs paying roughly 2.5 per cent, cash sitting on the sidelines is barely keeping pace with the cost of living, meaning it isn’t just missing upside — it’s struggling to hold its value.",

    "fullText": "The job market is brutal right now, and there's growing concern that 2026 could see more layoffs. However, Morgan Stanley says that many companies may be able to avoid having to slash head count.\n\nThe bank's chief US economist, Michael T. Gapen, and his team wrote on Tuesday that the US economy may be able to avoid widespread layoffs in 2026 but only if companies continue hiking prices, after already raising them throughout 2025.\n\nRising layoffs and sticky inflation were two of the big macro themes that defined 2025. According to Gapen and his team, companies opted to decrease hiring and reduce staffing to avoid raising prices earlier in the year as tariff pressures kicked in.\n\nNow, Morgan Stanley says that this may be the key to avoiding widespread layoffs in the coming year.\n\n\"We think the majority of the tariff pass-through to final consumer prices will have been completed at that point, assuming the administration does not push tariff policy further,\" Gapen said. \"On net, our outlook assumes inflation firms, profitability is largely restored, and the economy avoids layoffs.\"\n\nThe economist added that his team doesn't expect the Trump administration to implement new tariffs as the 2026 midterm elections approach. Yet, the analysts also emphasize that they don't think companies are done raising prices.\n\nThe bank maintains its baseline view that the existing tariffs will push core inflation to 3% early in 2026, with signs already being seen in the cost of consumer goods.\n\n\"Monthly rates of consumer price inflation in June through September have come with observable increases in components of CPI and PCE that have high direct exposure to tariffs,\" Gapen wrote.\n\nMorgan Stanley's analysis also found that companies have started to recoup some of the money they lost in early 2025 after being impacted by tariffs. That's a promising development, particularly as the bank predicts that many firms can raise prices while still maintaining the bulk of their customer base.\n\nHowever, the thesis that higher prices can help prevent layoffs in 2026 only applies so long as customers continue to stomach higher costs.\n\nConsumers have a limit to how much more they'll pay for goods, particularly as economic uncertainty remains high. It is unclear just how high prices can go before shoppers balk.\n\n\"If firms found they could not push output prices higher on account of consumer resistance and loss of market share, then we think they would turn to reducing labor costs further, triggering layoffs,\" Morgan Stanley added.",

    "fullText": "What keeps the money doctor up at night?\n\nSteve Hanke, a veteran economist and applied economics professor at Johns Hopkins University, said there are two significant problems in the US economy and markets that are keeping him from getting a good night's sleep.\n\nOne is inflation, which he thinks could start to spiral out of the Fed's control.\n\nThe other is high stock prices, which will start crashing back to earth, he told Business Insider.\n\n\"What is keeping me up at night is the idea that the Fed is going to be unable to hit its inflation target in 2026,\" the veteran economist and commodities trader wrote.\n\n\"As far as the stock market is concerned, my Dr. X's Bubble Detector is sitting at an all-time high, indicating that we are in a bubble,\" he added of equity prices.\n\nOn the inflation front, there are a few signs that price growth in the US is starting to heat up again. Headline inflation was cooler than expected in November, but still considerably above the Fed's 2% target.\n\nHanke, who has described himself as a \"money doctor\" and has long held the view that the money supply is a key driver of inflation, also pointed to the recent growth in the M2 money supply. That's a measure of the amount of cash flowing around the economy, and it has climbed by $3.5 trillion over the past five years, according to Federal Reserve data.\n\n\"For me, that is the most important metric,\" Hanke said of the inflation outlook. \"It looks like the money supply is going to be goosed, if not over-goosed.\"\n\nThere are a few developments that look like they can stoke inflation leading into the next year, Hanke said:\n\n\"My concern is that, after letting the money supply explode in 2020-21 and imposing inflation on Americans, the Fed has failed to put the inflation Genie back in the bottle,\" Hanke said.\n\nThe outlook for the stock market doesn't look much better, in Hanke's view. He pointed to bloated valuations in the tech sector as the mania for artificial intelligence reaches new heights.\n\n\"As far as the warning signs concerning the course of an AI bubble, you will never know when you will realize a Wile E. Coyote moment,\" he said, later adding that he advised investors to rebalance their portfolios.\n\nHanke, known for his persistently bearish forecasts for markets and the economy, has long forewarned of trouble heading for the US. In October, he speculated that AI companies today could eventually see a dot-com-style fate once they started missing their growth forecasts.\n\nLast year, he also doubled down on his call that the US economy was headed for a recession, but told Business Insider he had recently started leaning away from that stance on account of hotter inflation.",

    "description": "Stagflation, a scenario where growth is sluggish while inflation remains elevated, is one of the biggest risks the Fed faces in 2026, Apollo said.",
    "fullText": "A top economist is back with a stagflation warning.\n\nTorsten Sløk, the chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said he believes stagflation is still one of the biggest risks facing the Federal Reserve next year, even as investors breathe a sigh of relief after a light November inflation print.\n\nThat risk is jeopardizing a key source of fuel for the stock market rally: the prospect of more rate cuts.\n\n\"I still think that stagflation is a risk because there's still some headwinds coming, especially if AI does not deliver,\" Sløk said, pointing to the downside risks to growth and upside risks to consumer prices heading into the new year.\n\n\"Given that inflation is very sticky and now has the risk of going up over the next six months, then the key issue for the FOMC becomes: can we even cut in that environment?\" he later added.\n\nStagflation, which is often referred to by market pundits as one of the worst-case scenarios for the economy, describes a situation where growth remains sluggish while inflation remains elevated. That's a difficult combo for policymakers to respond to, as hot inflation prevents the Fed from cutting interest rates to boost economic growth.\n\nOn paper, things seem to be moving in the opposite direction. GDP is expected to have expanded a robust 3.5% over the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed economists, while inflation cooled to a 2.7% year-over-year pace, per the November CPI report.\n\nBut the US's vulnerability to stagflation is real, Sløk suggested. He pointed to the risk that AI firms will start to slow their spending on the technology, or that the billions they've already poured into AI won't produce the returns investors are expecting.\n\nMeanwhile, the ISM Services Prices Index, one forward-looking inflation indicator, clocked in at 65.4% in November, well within expansionary territory.\n\nCentral bankers also seem to be worried about stagflation, Sløk said. The number of FOMC members who said they believed the risks to inflation and unemployment were skewed to the upside far outnumbered those who said they believed risks were skewed to the downside, he wrote in a note to clients this week.\n\n\"In other words, the Fed continues to forecast stagflation and is concerned that we in 2026 may experience rising inflation and rising unemployment at the same time,\" Sløk wrote.\n\n\"The bottom line is, in the next six months, and especially when we get to April, we'll begin to see some fairly meaningful risks that inflation is still going to be elevated,\" he later told CNBC.\n\nThe outlook for rate cuts looks dim heading into the new year. The probability that the Fed will trim rates another 25 basis points in January ticked up following the November CPI report, but investors are largely expecting the central bank to keep rates steady at its next policy meeting, with the odds of a cut at the March meeting at just 45%, per the CME FedWatch tool.",

    "fullText": "The US economy will keep burning hot in 2026, extending a yearslong run of dodging a recession.\n\nThat's a view that is increasingly being woven into consensus forecasts on Wall Street, where top researchers have generally brushed off the risks of a near-term recession and are anticipating another year of stable economic growth and hot inflation.\n\nBank of America dubbed this the \"run-it-hot\" scenario for the US economy back in September, and others have since adopted the phrase.\n\nIn its year-ahead economic outlook, BofA said it believes growth will remain strong and inflation will stay above target next year, pointing to tailwinds such as the Fed's rate cuts, AI investment, more supportive trade policy, and stimulus in President Donald Trump's Big Beautiful Bill.\n\n\"Tariff cuts, tax cuts, rate cuts…'run-it-hot' US policy, implicit guarantee economy & stocks 'too big to fail,'\" a team of analysts led by Michael Hartnett wrote in a separate client note this fall.\n\nMorgan Stanley strategists also unveiled their \"run it hot\" investment thesis heading into 2026, pointing to the Fed's rate-cutting cycle and the central bank's recent announcement that it would begin reserve management purchases.\n\nGoldman Sachs said it also saw economic growth remaining robust in 2026, thanks to the Fed cutting rates in a non-recessionary macro environment.\n\n\"Despite stagnant job growth, we expect policy rate cuts to limit labour market weakness and help extend the economic cycle further,\" Goldman said, though it noted that valuations in the stock market are already \"hot.\"\n\nHere's how the forecasters think investors should position themselves in a \"run it hot\" market.\n\nCommodities are the top run-it-hot trade heading into next year, Bank of America strategists wrote in a note in December.\n\nOil and energy are also favorable investments under the run-it-hot regime, they added.\n\n\"Trump runs it hot, oil bounces post Russia-Ukraine fix, China keeps yuan cheap, soon all the commodity charts will look like gold,\" strategists wrote. \"We say long commodities the best 'run it hot' trade in '26, and long despised oil/energy without question the best 'run-it-hot' contrarian trade.\"\n\nCyclical assets — which, by definition, tend to do well when the economy is expanding — are likely to benefit from the macro picture next year, Goldman Sachs said.\n\nThe bank pointed to areas like housing and consumer-facing sides of the market, which include consumer discretionary and retail stocks.\n\n\"After a patch of worry in November, cyclical assets—including cyclical equities and copper—have been rallying again. But even after these recent moves, we think our more optimistic growth views are not fully reflected in markets,\" the bank wrote.\n\nMorgan Stanley thinks consumer discretionary goods investments fall into the \"run it hot\" investing playbook. The bank noted that firms generally have higher pricing power today, which should boost revenue growth.\n\nThat dynamic is already playing out in the discretionary goods sector, strategists said. The rate for top-line earnings beats in the sector for the third quarter clocked in at 6%, above the 2% rate for the overall S&P 500, per Morgan Stanley's analysis.\n\nSmall-cap stocks also look attractive, with earnings and pricing power in the sector poised to accelerate heading into next year, Morgan Stanley added.\n\n\"On the earnings front, the two most important aspects of our constructive call are the return of (1) positive operating leverage and (2) pricing power. This combination is especially impactful for the small cap earnings recovery we foresee into 2026,\" the bank's strategists added.\n\nForecasters at Bank of America and Goldman Sachs have also issued bullish calls on small-cap stocks heading into 2026, largely because valuations in the sector are more attractive than in areas such as mega-cap tech stocks.",

    "fullText": "Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing for his annual televised Q&A session, and a new poll shows Russians remain focused on two issues: the war and the economy.\n\nAccording to a poll of 1,608 Russians conducted by the independent Levada Center, the top two concerns Russians want to raise with Putin are when the war will end and how they're supposed to cope with a deteriorating economy.\n\nAbout a fifth of respondents said they would ask Putin when the war in Ukraine, which the Kremlin calls a \"special military operation,\" would end.\n\nRight behind the war is the economy, as another 16% say their top question is about living standards — salaries, pensions, and benefits.\n\nThese two concerns have topped Levada's polls ahead of Putin's annual Q&A for three years.\n\nBeyond the top concerns, Levada found that 8% of respondents want to ask Putin about price growth and tax hikes, 6% about utilities and social services, and 5% about the healthcare system.\n\nThe anxiety comes as Russia's inflation remains high, and the country's massive defense spending jostles with social spending.\n\nPutin's televised \"Direct Line\" Q&A session, scheduled for Friday, comes nearly four years after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, triggering sweeping Western sanctions.\n\nSince the invasion in February 2022, the Kremlin has steered the country onto a wartime economic footing.\n\nHeavy defense spending and state-directed investment have helped sustain headline economic growth, even as sanctions and export restrictions have reshaped trade flows.\n\nBut strains are showing: Energy export revenues have dropped in a softer oil-price environment, while high inflation continues to sap consumer demand.\n\nPrevious hourslong \"Direct Line\" broadcasts offer a preview of how Putin may handle the questions the Kremlin allows.\n\nLast year, Putin acknowledged that Russia's economy was overheating amid high inflation and warned citizens to brace for continued pressure.\n\nHowever, he deflected blame, suggesting that both the central bank and the Russian federal government — formally headed by the prime minister — could have acted more decisively to prevent the surge in prices and credit growth.\n\nPutin is also expected to hold an end-of-year news conference on Friday, where the spotlight will be on any signals he offers about the direction of the war.",

    "description": "The consumer price index increased 2.7%, short of the forecast and September's 3% rise.",
    "fullText": "The year-over-year inflation rate slowed to 2.7% in November, down from 3% in September, the last month for which data is available.\n\nEconomists expected a 3.1% rate, which would have been the highest since May 2024.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics won't be able to calculate an overall consumer price index for October 2025 because the government shutdown that lasted from October to roughly mid-November affected data collection.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a press conference earlier this month that inflation and the labor market data would be \"distorted\" and should be viewed with a \"skeptical eye.\"\n\nThe Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.6% from a year ago in November, below the 3% forecast and the 3% year-over-year rise in September.\n\nThe food index also increased by 2.6% over the year in November, which is lower than the 3.1% rise in September. Food away from home, such as at restaurants, rose more quickly than food at home, such as groceries, increasing by 3.7% and 1.9%, respectively.\n\nThe shelter index, which had generally been rising at a slower rate, rose 3% year over year in November, far below September's 3.6% increase.\n\nEarlier this week, the BLS also published October and November job growth data, as well as last month's unemployment rate, providing more clarity to the state of the economy after a murky data picture due to delayed or canceled government data releases. This delayed report revealed a mixed labor market, characterized by better-than-expected job growth, unemployment rate above that in September, and slowing wage growth.\n\nBoth reports will be helpful for the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision. Before the CPI release, CME FedWatch showed a roughly 75% chance that the Fed would hold rates steady, after three straight cuts, and about a 25% chance of a 25-basis-point cut. The probabilities didn't change that much after the release, shifting to about 71% and about 29%, respectively.\n\n\"Today's low inflation reading won't move the needle for the Fed given how noisy the data is,\" Kay Haigh, global cohead of Fixed Income and Liquidity Solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee members, who make the federal funds rate decision, won't meet again until January 27 and January 28, so they will have even more labor market and inflation information before then to make their call.\n\n\"All told this is a positive report, that comes with an asterisk. Subsequent CPI's will likely smooth out the statistical errors that might have been present in today's report,\" Art Hogan, chief market strategist for B. Riley Wealth, said.",

    "fullText": "Stock investors got two pieces of good news on Thursday.\n\nUS stocks jumped as investors took in a cooler-than-expected inflation report, bolstering confidence in the economy and lifting hopes that the Fed will continue its rate-cutting cycle heading into next year.\n\nConsumer prices rose 2.7% year-over-year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, lower than the 3.1% annualized increase economists were expecting.\n\nMeanwhile, the tech sector got a break after days of weakness. Chip stocks, led largely by Micron Technology, which jumped as much as 14%. The chipmaker reported strong earnings and issued robust guidance, helping to erase some losses from Wednesday's session.\n\nMajor indexes rose in the early morning and surged on the CPI release. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose more than 1%.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Thursday:\n\nHere were the other notable moves in the tech sector:\n\nThe latest CPI data is a much-needed piece of good news for the market, which has been under pressure as investors take stock of high valuations and sort through their queasy feelings about the AI sector.\n\nCooler inflation, combined with a weaker US job market, has widened the path for the Fed to continue its cutting rates in 2026. The odds that the central bank will cut rates another 25 basis points by March edged higher after the CPI data.\n\nThe 10-year US Treasury yield dropped to around 4.1% on Thursday.\n\n\"The inflation bump from tariffs is behind us, so the path is now clear for the Fed to lower rates again in January. There is no longer a case for restrictive monetary policy,\" Jamie Cox, a managing partner at Harris Financial Group, said in a statement.\n\nStephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate, said the latest CPI reading suggested the Fed may already be ahead of its inflation targets for the next year.\n\n\"The numbers this morning helped support the Fed narrative that the risks to the job market were rising faster than the risks to inflation,\" Scott Helfstein, the head of investment strategy at Global X, wrote in a note.\n\nMicron, meanwhile, soothed investors' anxieties in the AI sector, as the chipmaker reported $13.6 billion in revenue, exceeding the $12.8 billion Wall Street had expected.\n\nThe company said that it expects to pull around $18.7 billion in revenue for the current quarter, higher than the $14.2 billion analysts had pencilled in.\n\nInvestors are interpreting the results as another bit of evidence that AI chip demand is still strong. The news is quelling some anxiety over massive amounts of spending being poured into AI, which sparked a sell-off yesterday on a Financial Times report that said Blue Owl Capital had backed out of a $10 billion data center deal with Oracle.\n\n\"MU's double-digit percentage pre-market gain has investors breathing a sigh of relief, but you can't fault anyone for being a little cynical after seeing how some other AI-related stocks recently performed in reaction to what, at face value, looked like impressive reports,\" Paul Hickey, the co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, said.",

They are also trying to secure deals with flag-carrying countries to make it easier to board the vessels.\n\nEU headquarters said the businessmen “control vessels transporting crude oil or petroleum products, originating in Russia or being exported from Russia, concealing the actual origin of the oil, while practicing irregular and high-risk shipping practices.”\n\nThe four shipping companies targeted are based in the United Arab Emirates, Vietnam and Russia. A statement said they own or manage shadow fleet tankers under sanctions and which transport oil “while practicing irregular and high-risk shipping practices.”\n\nThe sanctions, which were agreed at a meeting of the 27-nation bloc's foreign ministers in Brussels, involve mostly asset freezes and travel bans.\n\nThe EU move adds to growing pressure on the shadow fleet. Last month, Ukraine used domestically produced Sea Baby naval drones to strike two more Russian oil tankers in the Black Sea. Both were under international sanctions.\n\nSeparately, the bloc imposed sanctions on members of Russia’s military intelligence agency, GRU, and a hacking group known as Cadet Blizzard, accusing them of cyber attacks targeting Ukraine, the EU and unnamed NATO allies.\n\nThe EU also added a number of foreign policy analysts and influencers accused of promoting pro-Russian propaganda or conspiracy theories to its sanctions list.",

    "fullText": "Markets are expecting key updates this week that could inform the trajectory of stocks through year-end and into 2026.\n\nUS stocks gained to start the week as investors looked ahead to a heavy schedule of economic data and Fedspeak. The biggest updates will be November jobs and inflation data, two of the biggest focuses for investors in recent months as they try to chart the path for Fed rate cuts heading into the new year.\n\nMajor indexes were volatile as Monday trading kicked off, edging higher before giving up some gains.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood around 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Wednesday:\n\nHere's a run-down of the economic data investors will be getting this week:\n\nThe strength of the job market has been front and center for the Fed, which cut rates another 25 basis-points last week and suggested that it would focus its efforts on supporting the labor market as opposed to keeping a lid on inflation.\n\nThis jobs report is expected to come into particular focus, given that the November data was delayed due to the government shutdown.\n\nThe market looks to be in a \"bad is good regime,\" analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note on Monday, referring to how weak jobs data can be bullish for stocks as it tees up expectations for more monetary policy easing.\n\n\"This week's jobs data could be more important for equities' perception of interest rate policy going forward than last week's FOMC meeting,\" the bank wrote. \"This implies that moderate labor market weakness is likely to be viewed in a bullish context by equity markets.\"\n\nThursday's inflation report could also feed into rate-cut expectations.\n\n\"Thursday's delayed CPI report provides a much needed update on how inflation has fared in recent months. The market is still hungry for inflation data even as it appears that the Fed is more focused on the labor market at this time,\" Rick Gardner, the CIO at RGA Investments, wrote in a note on Monday.\n\nThe economic releases will be supplemented by a lineup of Fed speakers this week, who are expected to provide insight into the path of monetary policy heading into next year. Here's the list of central bankers:\n\nInvestors think a rate cut is certain at the Fed's January policy meeting, and are pricing in a 26% probability that the central bank could issue a jumbo-sized 50 basis-point rate cut that month, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nStill, stocks have been struggling to move meaningfully higher after a rough performance in November. The tech sector remains under pressure as investors assess high valuations and fret over a potential AI bubble.\n\n\"Friday's selloff suggests that investors are taking some profits in tech stocks and reallocating money into value-oriented stocks. This rotation is not surprising, especially as we head into year-end,\" RGA's Gardner added.",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nFor many Americans, retirement isn’t just about getting by — it’s about living comfortably and maintaining a middle-class lifestyle.\n\nEarning $12,000 a month ($144,000 a year) in passive income, for instance, could make that possible, covering everyday expenses while still allowing for travel, dining out and other luxuries.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nBut reaching that level of income in retirement requires more than just a large nest egg. Your savings must also be resilient enough to handle inflation, market swings and the risk of outliving your money.\n\nThe financial bar for this kind of retirement is likely higher than most people expect. Here’s why.\n\nRetiring on $144,000 isn’t typical. In 2025, the “magic number” for retirement savings is $1.26 million, according to a Northwestern Mutual study (1). Using the standard 4% rule, that equates to about $50,400 per year — or $4,200 per month in retirement income.\n\nThat figure aligns closely with the median retirement income of $54,710 for Americans over 65, based on 2023 U.S. Census Bureau data (2).\n\nThat’s already a steep target, but it only scratches the surface. Once you factor in inflation and longevity risk, the bar climbs even higher.\n\nIf you’re hoping to achieve three times the average retirement income, you may benefit from working with an advisor. People who work with financial advisors see a 3% increase in net returns, according to a report from Vanguard.\n\nThe advisors at Range offer white-glove financial services to high-income households.\n\nOnce your equity enters this ballpark, one of the most significant financial pain points can be asset under management (AUM) fees. These fees mean that portfolio managers take a percentage of the value, typically between 0.5% and 2%, of your managed assets — so as your wealth grows, so do their fees.",

    "fullText": "The Fed cut interest rates for the third time this year on Wednesday, and the meeting held some key takeaways for how the central bank is thinking about the economy heading into 2026.\n\nFrom the labor market to inflation to stocks, here's everything to know about the latest Fed decision.\n\nFed leaders anticipate more economic growth in 2026 and stable unemployment levels, but are somewhat concerned about slowing labor demand and participation. Lower rates could help juice hiring, Powell said.\n\nIn terms of AI, the Fed chair said chatbots are not yet replacing jobs — even as Corporate America sees shrinking while collar roles. \"It's part of the story, but it's not a big part of the story yet,\" he said. And, though some Big Tech firms and major retailers, have had high-profile cuts in 2025, Powell added that overall layoff rates are still relatively low.\n\nThe figure remains slightly above the Fed's 2% goal, though data is limited due to the government shutdown. With lower rates, there's a risk consumer prices will rise too. At the same time, Powell said consumer spending has been strong and the main driver of inflation right now is tariff policy, not broad economic weakness.\n\nIt was a hawkish rate cut overall, but markets rallied sharply anyway.\n\nThe S&P 500 edged up to a near-record close and the Dow jump almost 500 points, adding to gains as Powell's press conference got going. A few things came out of the meeting that boosted investors' bullishness.\n\nWith Powell's term up in May, Trump is set to name a successor in January.\n\n\"I really want to turn this job over to whoever replaces me with the economy in really good shape,\" he said. \"I want inflation to be back down to 2% and I want the labor market to be strong — that's what I want. All of my efforts are to get to that place.\"\n\nMembers of the Federal Open Market Committee showed significant division on Wednesday, with three members dissenting to the cut call. It's the biggest split seen at a Fed meeting since 2019 and signals ongoing tension between the Fed's dual mandate and how each member weighs employment and inflation risks.\n\nPowell, however, said there's no bad blood.\n\n\"The discussions we have are as good as any we've had in my 14 years at the Fed,\" he said. \"They're very thoughtful and respectful and people have strong views",

After trimming rates twice this autumn and by 1.5 percentage points over the past 15 months the Fed is inching toward levels that could stimulate economic activity, something many policymakers would prefer to avoid. A growing number of officials believe the benchmark may now be sitting at a neutral level that neither accelerates nor restrains growth, creating the possibility of a more divided outcome and, according to several analysts, as many as three dissents.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with AMZN.\n\nIs AMZN fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nThe shutdown that consumed October and most of November has left Powell without timely data to guide the next narrative. Investors will be watching closely as officials release a fresh statement on Wednesday, where the Fed could reiterate that labor-market risks have risen in recent months while inflation remains somewhat elevated. Powell must navigate a wide spectrum of views when he speaks at his press conference, especially with consumer spending showing little change in September and layoffs declining overall, despite high-profile cutbacks from companies including Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Without updated economic readings until mid-December, Powell may have limited room to commit to any firm path forward.\n\nEconomists increasingly think policymakers will pause after this week's move while they evaluate incoming data, and the committee's new projections could underscore just how split the outlook has become. In September, eight officials favored stopping cuts at levels expected after Wednesday's decision, while nine signaled at least two more in 2026. The median outlook could adjust growth for 2025 slightly higher, trim inflation estimates for the end of this year, and nudge unemployment forecasts upward. Powell faces a more fragmented committee, with several regional presidents arguing against further reductions and Fed Governor Stephen Miran expected to dissent again in favor of a larger half-point cut. Investors are now looking toward the White House, where President Donald Trump is weighing his choice to succeed Powell when his term expires in May, and Kevin Hassett is widely viewed as a leading contender.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will road-test his claims that he's tackling Americans' affordability woes at a Tuesday rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania — shifting an argument made in Oval Office appearances and social media posts to a campaign-style event.\n\nThe trip comes as polling consistently shows that public trust in Trump's economic leadership has faltered. Following dismal results for Republicans in last month's off-cycle elections, the White House has sought to convince voters that the economy will emerge stronger next year and that any anxieties over inflation have nothing to do with Trump.\n\nThe president has consistently blamed his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, for inflation even as his own aggressive implementation of policies has pushed up prices that had been settling down after spiking in 2022 to a four-decade high. Inflation began to accelerate after Trump announced his sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs in April. Companies warned that the import taxes could be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices and reduced hiring, yet Trump continues to insist that inflation has faded.\n\n“We’re bringing prices way down,\" Trump said at the White House on Monday. “You can call it ‘affordability’ or anything you want — but the Democrats caused the affordability problem, and we’re the ones that are fixing it.”\n\nThe president's reception in the county hosting his Tuesday rally could give a signal of just how much voters trust his claims. Monroe County flipped to Trump in the 2024 election after having backed Biden in 2020, helping the Republican to win the swing state of Pennsylvania and return to the White House after a four-year hiatus.\n\nAs home to the Pocono Mountains, the county has largely relied on tourism for skiing, hiking, hunting and other activities as a source of jobs. Its proximity to New York City — under two hours by car — has also attracted people seeking more affordable housing.\n\nIt's also an area that could help decide control of the House in next year's midterm elections.\n\nTrump is holding his rally in a congressional district held by freshman Republican Rep. Rob Bresnahan, who is a top target of Democrats and won his 2024 race by about 1.5 percentage points, among the nation’s closest. Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti, a Democrat, is running for the nomination to challenge him.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is running digital ads during Trump's visit on the Wilkes-Barre Times-Leader website that criticize Bresnahan for his stock trading while in Congress and suggest that Trump has not as promised addressed double-dealing in Washington.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Susie Wiles said on the online conservative talk show “The Mom View” that Trump would be on the “campaign trail” next year to engage supporters who otherwise might sit out a congressional race.\n\nWiles, who helped manage Trump's 2024 campaign, said most administrations try to localize midterm elections and keep the president out of the race, but she intends to do the opposite of that.\n\n“We’re actually going to turn that on its head,\" Wiles said, \"and put him on the ballot because so many of those low-propensity voters are Trump voters.”\n\nWiles added, “So I haven’t quite broken it to him yet, but he’s going to campaign like it’s 2024 again.”\n\nThe challenge for Trump is how to address the concerns of voters about the economy while simultaneously claiming that the economy is enjoying an historic boom.\n\nAsked on a Politico podcast about how he'd rate the economy, Trump leaned into the grade inflation by answering “A-plus,” only to then amend his answer to “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.”\n\nTrump has said he's giving consumers relief by relaxing fuel efficiency standards for autos and signing agreements to reduce list prices on prescription drugs.\n\nTrump has also advocated for cuts to the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate — which influences the supply of money in the U.S. economy. He argues that would reduce the cost of mortgages and auto loans, although critics warn that cuts of the scale sought by Trump could instead worsen inflation.\n\nThe U.S. economy has shown signs of resilience with the stock market up this year and overall growth looking solid for the third quarter. But many Americans see the prices of housing, groceries, education, electricity and other basic needs as swallowing up their incomes, a dynamic that the Trump administration has said it expects to fade next year with more investments in artificial intelligence and manufacturing.\n\nSince the elections in November when Democrats won key races with a focus on kitchen table issues, Trump has often dismissed the concerns about prices as a “hoax” and a “con job” to suggest that he bears no responsibility for inflation, even though he campaigned on his ability to quickly bring down prices. Just 33% of U.S. adults approve of Trump's handling of the economy, according to a November survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nLevy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",

    "description": "Jerome Powell will soon announce the next Fed decision on a potential interest rate cut. The Fed is missing key economic data on jobs and inflation.",
    "fullText": "The Federal Reserve has one more decision in 2025 — and it will set the tone for where interest rates will go in the new year.\n\nOn Wednesday, leaders at the central bank will decide whether to continue cutting rates or put a pause on loosening monetary policy. The call will have ripple effects across consumer prices, the job market, and Corporate America. CME FedWatch predicted the Fed had a roughly 90% chance of a quarter-point cut on Monday.\n\nBut slicing rates isn't a sure thing. The final Federal Open Market Committee meeting of 2025 will follow the record-long government shutdown, which upended job stability for federal workers and disrupted data releases, including on unemployment and inflation. Even with the government open again, federal agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics continue to delay or have canceled their reports. It leaves the Fed's decision makers without a full picture of US economic health.\n\n\"The risk to the labor market's still there, the risks to inflation are still there, neither of which are necessarily a cause for alarm right now,\" Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, told Business Insider, but \"the picture is cloudy.\"\n\nFed leaders are missing some key job and price data. Because BLS didn't collect new data during the shutdown, the agency can't publish the October consumer price index report or the October unemployment rate, and the November jobs report and inflation data won't be released in time for the December meeting.\n\nRenter said the murky economic picture may mean the Fed leans on last-minute data reports to make its decision. The job openings and labor turnover survey results and the employment cost index will be released on December 9 and December 10, respectively.\n\nThe delayed September jobs report that came out on November 20 showed that the US added more jobs than expected that month, and unemployment increased amid an increase in labor force participation. Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, told Business Insider that this doesn't mean the job market is reinvigorated or that the Fed's concerns over the labor market would immediately fade.\n\n\"We're still off to one of the worst starts we've had since 2010 after you take out the pandemic,\" Stahle said. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in the last FOMC press conference that labor market conditions had \"not changed much\" between the Fed's September and October meetings.\n\nClaudia Sahm, the chief economist for New Century Advisors, expects the Fed to cut rates again, but wouldn't be surprised if members then decide to hold off for a while to see how the economy evolves. She also said there hasn't been much progress on cooling US inflation this year. After another cut to help with the job market, she expects a wait-and-see period before another rate cut, assuming there aren't drastic labor market changes.\n\n\"I have a feeling that if all goes well in the economy, the Fed probably is not going to be doing a whole lot because they took steps right now to ensure against the worst outcomes,\" Sahm said. \"Then it's just going to take time for the inflation to start moving back down.\"\n\nThe Fed has kept monetary policy restrictive so far this year, holding rates steady until September. But not all Fed leaders agree. Minutes from recent meetings show that some FOMC members would prefer larger and more consistent interest rate cuts. It's possible that monetary strategy could change in 2026, as Powell's term ends in May. President Donald Trump — who has been a vocal advocate for rate cuts — is likely to nominate a new Fed chair in January.\n\nA third consecutive cut would help make major purchases more affordable.\n\nThirty-year fixed mortgages, two-year auto loans, and credit card rates tend to fluctuate alongside the federal funds rate. And, while inflation remains above the Fed's 2% goal, mortgage rates have largely cooled in recent months in anticipation of rate reductions.\n\nA quarter-point cut could mean lower returns on investment for savers using high-yield savings accounts or certificates of deposit, though it would become cheaper to pay off credit cards. Lower rates would also make home equity lines and small business loans more accessible to Americans.\n\nIf there is a cut, Renter said it could be a positive sign for people applying to roles in the sluggish labor market: If job seekers \"hear that the Fed is responding to an unfavorable labor market, that's going to feel good to them; they may feel like relief is on the horizon,\" she said.\n\nSustained rate cuts would bolster the job market by making it easier for businesses to borrow and invest money. This would free up more funds for companies to hire and pay employees, which could lead to higher consumer spending — all factors needed for a healthy economy.\n\nThough Powell said the Fed will be careful to balance jobs goals with curbing inflation. A rate change is likely this week, but \"not a foregone conclusion, far from it,\" he said. \"Policy is not on a preset course.\"",
