    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nFor many Americans, retirement isn’t just about getting by — it’s about living comfortably and maintaining a middle-class lifestyle.\n\nEarning $12,000 a month ($144,000 a year) in passive income, for instance, could make that possible, covering everyday expenses while still allowing for travel, dining out and other luxuries.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nBut reaching that level of income in retirement requires more than just a large nest egg. Your savings must also be resilient enough to handle inflation, market swings and the risk of outliving your money.\n\nThe financial bar for this kind of retirement is likely higher than most people expect. Here’s why.\n\nRetiring on $144,000 isn’t typical. In 2025, the “magic number” for retirement savings is $1.26 million, according to a Northwestern Mutual study (1). Using the standard 4% rule, that equates to about $50,400 per year — or $4,200 per month in retirement income.\n\nThat figure aligns closely with the median retirement income of $54,710 for Americans over 65, based on 2023 U.S. Census Bureau data (2).\n\nThat’s already a steep target, but it only scratches the surface. Once you factor in inflation and longevity risk, the bar climbs even higher.\n\nIf you’re hoping to achieve three times the average retirement income, you may benefit from working with an advisor. People who work with financial advisors see a 3% increase in net returns, according to a report from Vanguard.\n\nThe advisors at Range offer white-glove financial services to high-income households.\n\nOnce your equity enters this ballpark, one of the most significant financial pain points can be asset under management (AUM) fees. These fees mean that portfolio managers take a percentage of the value, typically between 0.5% and 2%, of your managed assets — so as your wealth grows, so do their fees.",

    "fullText": "The Fed cut interest rates for the third time this year on Wednesday, and the meeting held some key takeaways for how the central bank is thinking about the economy heading into 2026.\n\nFrom the labor market to inflation to stocks, here's everything to know about the latest Fed decision.\n\nFed leaders anticipate more economic growth in 2026 and stable unemployment levels, but are somewhat concerned about slowing labor demand and participation. Lower rates could help juice hiring, Powell said.\n\nIn terms of AI, the Fed chair said chatbots are not yet replacing jobs — even as Corporate America sees shrinking while collar roles. \"It's part of the story, but it's not a big part of the story yet,\" he said. And, though some Big Tech firms and major retailers, have had high-profile cuts in 2025, Powell added that overall layoff rates are still relatively low.\n\nThe figure remains slightly above the Fed's 2% goal, though data is limited due to the government shutdown. With lower rates, there's a risk consumer prices will rise too. At the same time, Powell said consumer spending has been strong and the main driver of inflation right now is tariff policy, not broad economic weakness.\n\nIt was a hawkish rate cut overall, but markets rallied sharply anyway.\n\nThe S&P 500 edged up to a near-record close and the Dow jump almost 500 points, adding to gains as Powell's press conference got going. A few things came out of the meeting that boosted investors' bullishness.\n\nWith Powell's term up in May, Trump is set to name a successor in January.\n\n\"I really want to turn this job over to whoever replaces me with the economy in really good shape,\" he said. \"I want inflation to be back down to 2% and I want the labor market to be strong — that's what I want. All of my efforts are to get to that place.\"\n\nMembers of the Federal Open Market Committee showed significant division on Wednesday, with three members dissenting to the cut call. It's the biggest split seen at a Fed meeting since 2019 and signals ongoing tension between the Fed's dual mandate and how each member weighs employment and inflation risks.\n\nPowell, however, said there's no bad blood.\n\n\"The discussions we have are as good as any we've had in my 14 years at the Fed,\" he said. \"They're very thoughtful and respectful and people have strong views",

    "description": "A split central bank leaves Wall Street watching every word as inflation and missing data collide.",
    "fullText": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nFederal Reserve officials are set to push through a third consecutive rate cut on Wednesday, yet the debate inside the central bank could be more intense than the headline suggests. After trimming rates twice this autumn and by 1.5 percentage points over the past 15 months the Fed is inching toward levels that could stimulate economic activity, something many policymakers would prefer to avoid. A growing number of officials believe the benchmark may now be sitting at a neutral level that neither accelerates nor restrains growth, creating the possibility of a more divided outcome and, according to several analysts, as many as three dissents.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with AMZN.\n\nIs AMZN fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nThe shutdown that consumed October and most of November has left Powell without timely data to guide the next narrative. Investors will be watching closely as officials release a fresh statement on Wednesday, where the Fed could reiterate that labor-market risks have risen in recent months while inflation remains somewhat elevated. Powell must navigate a wide spectrum of views when he speaks at his press conference, especially with consumer spending showing little change in September and layoffs declining overall, despite high-profile cutbacks from companies including Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Without updated economic readings until mid-December, Powell may have limited room to commit to any firm path forward.\n\nEconomists increasingly think policymakers will pause after this week's move while they evaluate incoming data, and the committee's new projections could underscore just how split the outlook has become. In September, eight officials favored stopping cuts at levels expected after Wednesday's decision, while nine signaled at least two more in 2026. The median outlook could adjust growth for 2025 slightly higher, trim inflation estimates for the end of this year, and nudge unemployment forecasts upward. Powell faces a more fragmented committee, with several regional presidents arguing against further reductions and Fed Governor Stephen Miran expected to dissent again in favor of a larger half-point cut. Investors are now looking toward the White House, where President Donald Trump is weighing his choice to succeed Powell when his term expires in May, and Kevin Hassett is widely viewed as a leading contender.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will road-test his claims that he's tackling Americans' affordability woes at a Tuesday rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania — shifting an argument made in Oval Office appearances and social media posts to a campaign-style event.\n\nThe trip comes as polling consistently shows that public trust in Trump's economic leadership has faltered. Following dismal results for Republicans in last month's off-cycle elections, the White House has sought to convince voters that the economy will emerge stronger next year and that any anxieties over inflation have nothing to do with Trump.\n\nThe president has consistently blamed his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, for inflation even as his own aggressive implementation of policies has pushed up prices that had been settling down after spiking in 2022 to a four-decade high. Inflation began to accelerate after Trump announced his sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs in April. Companies warned that the import taxes could be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices and reduced hiring, yet Trump continues to insist that inflation has faded.\n\n“We’re bringing prices way down,\" Trump said at the White House on Monday. “You can call it ‘affordability’ or anything you want — but the Democrats caused the affordability problem, and we’re the ones that are fixing it.”\n\nThe president's reception in the county hosting his Tuesday rally could give a signal of just how much voters trust his claims. Monroe County flipped to Trump in the 2024 election after having backed Biden in 2020, helping the Republican to win the swing state of Pennsylvania and return to the White House after a four-year hiatus.\n\nAs home to the Pocono Mountains, the county has largely relied on tourism for skiing, hiking, hunting and other activities as a source of jobs. Its proximity to New York City — under two hours by car — has also attracted people seeking more affordable housing.\n\nIt's also an area that could help decide control of the House in next year's midterm elections.\n\nTrump is holding his rally in a congressional district held by freshman Republican Rep. Rob Bresnahan, who is a top target of Democrats and won his 2024 race by about 1.5 percentage points, among the nation’s closest. Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti, a Democrat, is running for the nomination to challenge him.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is running digital ads during Trump's visit on the Wilkes-Barre Times-Leader website that criticize Bresnahan for his stock trading while in Congress and suggest that Trump has not as promised addressed double-dealing in Washington.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Susie Wiles said on the online conservative talk show “The Mom View” that Trump would be on the “campaign trail” next year to engage supporters who otherwise might sit out a congressional race.\n\nWiles, who helped manage Trump's 2024 campaign, said most administrations try to localize midterm elections and keep the president out of the race, but she intends to do the opposite of that.\n\n“We’re actually going to turn that on its head,\" Wiles said, \"and put him on the ballot because so many of those low-propensity voters are Trump voters.”\n\nWiles added, “So I haven’t quite broken it to him yet, but he’s going to campaign like it’s 2024 again.”\n\nThe challenge for Trump is how to address the concerns of voters about the economy while simultaneously claiming that the economy is enjoying an historic boom.\n\nAsked on a Politico podcast about how he'd rate the economy, Trump leaned into the grade inflation by answering “A-plus,” only to then amend his answer to “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.”\n\nTrump has said he's giving consumers relief by relaxing fuel efficiency standards for autos and signing agreements to reduce list prices on prescription drugs.\n\nTrump has also advocated for cuts to the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate — which influences the supply of money in the U.S. economy. He argues that would reduce the cost of mortgages and auto loans, although critics warn that cuts of the scale sought by Trump could instead worsen inflation.\n\nThe U.S. economy has shown signs of resilience with the stock market up this year and overall growth looking solid for the third quarter. But many Americans see the prices of housing, groceries, education, electricity and other basic needs as swallowing up their incomes, a dynamic that the Trump administration has said it expects to fade next year with more investments in artificial intelligence and manufacturing.\n\nSince the elections in November when Democrats won key races with a focus on kitchen table issues, Trump has often dismissed the concerns about prices as a “hoax” and a “con job” to suggest that he bears no responsibility for inflation, even though he campaigned on his ability to quickly bring down prices. Just 33% of U.S. adults approve of Trump's handling of the economy, according to a November survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nLevy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",

    "description": "Jerome Powell will soon announce the next Fed decision on a potential interest rate cut. The Fed is missing key economic data on jobs and inflation.",
    "fullText": "The Federal Reserve has one more decision in 2025 — and it will set the tone for where interest rates will go in the new year.\n\nOn Wednesday, leaders at the central bank will decide whether to continue cutting rates or put a pause on loosening monetary policy. The call will have ripple effects across consumer prices, the job market, and Corporate America. CME FedWatch predicted the Fed had a roughly 90% chance of a quarter-point cut on Monday.\n\nBut slicing rates isn't a sure thing. The final Federal Open Market Committee meeting of 2025 will follow the record-long government shutdown, which upended job stability for federal workers and disrupted data releases, including on unemployment and inflation. Even with the government open again, federal agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics continue to delay or have canceled their reports. It leaves the Fed's decision makers without a full picture of US economic health.\n\n\"The risk to the labor market's still there, the risks to inflation are still there, neither of which are necessarily a cause for alarm right now,\" Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, told Business Insider, but \"the picture is cloudy.\"\n\nFed leaders are missing some key job and price data. Because BLS didn't collect new data during the shutdown, the agency can't publish the October consumer price index report or the October unemployment rate, and the November jobs report and inflation data won't be released in time for the December meeting.\n\nRenter said the murky economic picture may mean the Fed leans on last-minute data reports to make its decision. The job openings and labor turnover survey results and the employment cost index will be released on December 9 and December 10, respectively.\n\nThe delayed September jobs report that came out on November 20 showed that the US added more jobs than expected that month, and unemployment increased amid an increase in labor force participation. Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, told Business Insider that this doesn't mean the job market is reinvigorated or that the Fed's concerns over the labor market would immediately fade.\n\n\"We're still off to one of the worst starts we've had since 2010 after you take out the pandemic,\" Stahle said. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in the last FOMC press conference that labor market conditions had \"not changed much\" between the Fed's September and October meetings.\n\nClaudia Sahm, the chief economist for New Century Advisors, expects the Fed to cut rates again, but wouldn't be surprised if members then decide to hold off for a while to see how the economy evolves. She also said there hasn't been much progress on cooling US inflation this year. After another cut to help with the job market, she expects a wait-and-see period before another rate cut, assuming there aren't drastic labor market changes.\n\n\"I have a feeling that if all goes well in the economy, the Fed probably is not going to be doing a whole lot because they took steps right now to ensure against the worst outcomes,\" Sahm said. \"Then it's just going to take time for the inflation to start moving back down.\"\n\nThe Fed has kept monetary policy restrictive so far this year, holding rates steady until September. But not all Fed leaders agree. Minutes from recent meetings show that some FOMC members would prefer larger and more consistent interest rate cuts. It's possible that monetary strategy could change in 2026, as Powell's term ends in May. President Donald Trump — who has been a vocal advocate for rate cuts — is likely to nominate a new Fed chair in January.\n\nA third consecutive cut would help make major purchases more affordable.\n\nThirty-year fixed mortgages, two-year auto loans, and credit card rates tend to fluctuate alongside the federal funds rate. And, while inflation remains above the Fed's 2% goal, mortgage rates have largely cooled in recent months in anticipation of rate reductions.\n\nA quarter-point cut could mean lower returns on investment for savers using high-yield savings accounts or certificates of deposit, though it would become cheaper to pay off credit cards. Lower rates would also make home equity lines and small business loans more accessible to Americans.\n\nIf there is a cut, Renter said it could be a positive sign for people applying to roles in the sluggish labor market: If job seekers \"hear that the Fed is responding to an unfavorable labor market, that's going to feel good to them; they may feel like relief is on the horizon,\" she said.\n\nSustained rate cuts would bolster the job market by making it easier for businesses to borrow and invest money. This would free up more funds for companies to hire and pay employees, which could lead to higher consumer spending — all factors needed for a healthy economy.\n\nThough Powell said the Fed will be careful to balance jobs goals with curbing inflation. A rate change is likely this week, but \"not a foregone conclusion, far from it,\" he said. \"Policy is not on a preset course.\"",
