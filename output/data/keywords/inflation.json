    "description": "Morgan Stanley's top economist wrote this week that as long as prices can remain elevated, companies might be able to avoid having to slash headcount.",
    "fullText": "The job market is brutal right now, and there's growing concern that 2026 could see more layoffs. However, Morgan Stanley says that many companies may be able to avoid having to slash head count.\n\nThe bank's chief US economist, Michael T. Gapen, and his team wrote on Tuesday that the US economy may be able to avoid widespread layoffs in 2026 but only if companies continue hiking prices, after already raising them throughout 2025.\n\nRising layoffs and sticky inflation were two of the big macro themes that defined 2025. According to Gapen and his team, companies opted to decrease hiring and reduce staffing to avoid raising prices earlier in the year as tariff pressures kicked in.\n\nNow, Morgan Stanley says that this may be the key to avoiding widespread layoffs in the coming year.\n\n\"We think the majority of the tariff pass-through to final consumer prices will have been completed at that point, assuming the administration does not push tariff policy further,\" Gapen said. \"On net, our outlook assumes inflation firms, profitability is largely restored, and the economy avoids layoffs.\"\n\nThe economist added that his team doesn't expect the Trump administration to implement new tariffs as the 2026 midterm elections approach. Yet, the analysts also emphasize that they don't think companies are done raising prices.\n\nThe bank maintains its baseline view that the existing tariffs will push core inflation to 3% early in 2026, with signs already being seen in the cost of consumer goods.\n\n\"Monthly rates of consumer price inflation in June through September have come with observable increases in components of CPI and PCE that have high direct exposure to tariffs,\" Gapen wrote.\n\nMorgan Stanley's analysis also found that companies have started to recoup some of the money they lost in early 2025 after being impacted by tariffs. That's a promising development, particularly as the bank predicts that many firms can raise prices while still maintaining the bulk of their customer base.\n\nHowever, the thesis that higher prices can help prevent layoffs in 2026 only applies so long as customers continue to stomach higher costs.\n\nConsumers have a limit to how much more they'll pay for goods, particularly as economic uncertainty remains high. It is unclear just how high prices can go before shoppers balk.\n\n\"If firms found they could not push output prices higher on account of consumer resistance and loss of market share, then we think they would turn to reducing labor costs further, triggering layoffs,\" Morgan Stanley added.",

    "description": "Steve Hanke, a veteran economist, said he can't sleep at night thinking about inflation and high stock prices in the US.",
    "fullText": "What keeps the money doctor up at night?\n\nSteve Hanke, a veteran economist and applied economics professor at Johns Hopkins University, said there are two significant problems in the US economy and markets that are keeping him from getting a good night's sleep.\n\nOne is inflation, which he thinks could start to spiral out of the Fed's control.\n\nThe other is high stock prices, which will start crashing back to earth, he told Business Insider.\n\n\"What is keeping me up at night is the idea that the Fed is going to be unable to hit its inflation target in 2026,\" the veteran economist and commodities trader wrote.\n\n\"As far as the stock market is concerned, my Dr. X's Bubble Detector is sitting at an all-time high, indicating that we are in a bubble,\" he added of equity prices.\n\nOn the inflation front, there are a few signs that price growth in the US is starting to heat up again. Headline inflation was cooler than expected in November, but still considerably above the Fed's 2% target.\n\nHanke, who has described himself as a \"money doctor\" and has long held the view that the money supply is a key driver of inflation, also pointed to the recent growth in the M2 money supply. That's a measure of the amount of cash flowing around the economy, and it has climbed by $3.5 trillion over the past five years, according to Federal Reserve data.\n\n\"For me, that is the most important metric,\" Hanke said of the inflation outlook. \"It looks like the money supply is going to be goosed, if not over-goosed.\"\n\nThere are a few developments that look like they can stoke inflation leading into the next year, Hanke said:\n\n\"My concern is that, after letting the money supply explode in 2020-21 and imposing inflation on Americans, the Fed has failed to put the inflation Genie back in the bottle,\" Hanke said.\n\nThe outlook for the stock market doesn't look much better, in Hanke's view. He pointed to bloated valuations in the tech sector as the mania for artificial intelligence reaches new heights.\n\n\"As far as the warning signs concerning the course of an AI bubble, you will never know when you will realize a Wile E. Coyote moment,\" he said, later adding that he advised investors to rebalance their portfolios.\n\nHanke, known for his persistently bearish forecasts for markets and the economy, has long forewarned of trouble heading for the US. In October, he speculated that AI companies today could eventually see a dot-com-style fate once they started missing their growth forecasts.\n\nLast year, he also doubled down on his call that the US economy was headed for a recession, but told Business Insider he had recently started leaning away from that stance on account of hotter inflation.",

    "title": "Stagflation will derail one of the biggest drivers of the stock market rally next year, Apollo's top economist says",
    "description": "Stagflation, a scenario where growth is sluggish while inflation remains elevated, is one of the biggest risks the Fed faces in 2026, Apollo said.",
    "fullText": "A top economist is back with a stagflation warning.\n\nTorsten Sløk, the chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said he believes stagflation is still one of the biggest risks facing the Federal Reserve next year, even as investors breathe a sigh of relief after a light November inflation print.\n\nThat risk is jeopardizing a key source of fuel for the stock market rally: the prospect of more rate cuts.\n\n\"I still think that stagflation is a risk because there's still some headwinds coming, especially if AI does not deliver,\" Sløk said, pointing to the downside risks to growth and upside risks to consumer prices heading into the new year.\n\n\"Given that inflation is very sticky and now has the risk of going up over the next six months, then the key issue for the FOMC becomes: can we even cut in that environment?\" he later added.\n\nStagflation, which is often referred to by market pundits as one of the worst-case scenarios for the economy, describes a situation where growth remains sluggish while inflation remains elevated. That's a difficult combo for policymakers to respond to, as hot inflation prevents the Fed from cutting interest rates to boost economic growth.\n\nOn paper, things seem to be moving in the opposite direction. GDP is expected to have expanded a robust 3.5% over the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed economists, while inflation cooled to a 2.7% year-over-year pace, per the November CPI report.\n\nBut the US's vulnerability to stagflation is real, Sløk suggested. He pointed to the risk that AI firms will start to slow their spending on the technology, or that the billions they've already poured into AI won't produce the returns investors are expecting.\n\nMeanwhile, the ISM Services Prices Index, one forward-looking inflation indicator, clocked in at 65.4% in November, well within expansionary territory.\n\nCentral bankers also seem to be worried about stagflation, Sløk said. The number of FOMC members who said they believed the risks to inflation and unemployment were skewed to the upside far outnumbered those who said they believed risks were skewed to the downside, he wrote in a note to clients this week.\n\n\"In other words, the Fed continues to forecast stagflation and is concerned that we in 2026 may experience rising inflation and rising unemployment at the same time,\" Sløk wrote.\n\n\"The bottom line is, in the next six months, and especially when we get to April, we'll begin to see some fairly meaningful risks that inflation is still going to be elevated,\" he later told CNBC.\n\nThe outlook for rate cuts looks dim heading into the new year. The probability that the Fed will trim rates another 25 basis points in January ticked up following the November CPI report, but investors are largely expecting the central bank to keep rates steady at its next policy meeting, with the odds of a cut at the March meeting at just 45%, per the CME FedWatch tool.",

    "description": "Bank of America was among the first to flag a \"run-it-hot\" scenario for the US economy, defined by robust growth and above-target inflation.",
    "fullText": "The US economy will keep burning hot in 2026, extending a yearslong run of dodging a recession.\n\nThat's a view that is increasingly being woven into consensus forecasts on Wall Street, where top researchers have generally brushed off the risks of a near-term recession and are anticipating another year of stable economic growth and hot inflation.\n\nBank of America dubbed this the \"run-it-hot\" scenario for the US economy back in September, and others have since adopted the phrase.\n\nIn its year-ahead economic outlook, BofA said it believes growth will remain strong and inflation will stay above target next year, pointing to tailwinds such as the Fed's rate cuts, AI investment, more supportive trade policy, and stimulus in President Donald Trump's Big Beautiful Bill.\n\n\"Tariff cuts, tax cuts, rate cuts…'run-it-hot' US policy, implicit guarantee economy & stocks 'too big to fail,'\" a team of analysts led by Michael Hartnett wrote in a separate client note this fall.\n\nMorgan Stanley strategists also unveiled their \"run it hot\" investment thesis heading into 2026, pointing to the Fed's rate-cutting cycle and the central bank's recent announcement that it would begin reserve management purchases.\n\nGoldman Sachs said it also saw economic growth remaining robust in 2026, thanks to the Fed cutting rates in a non-recessionary macro environment.\n\n\"Despite stagnant job growth, we expect policy rate cuts to limit labour market weakness and help extend the economic cycle further,\" Goldman said, though it noted that valuations in the stock market are already \"hot.\"\n\nHere's how the forecasters think investors should position themselves in a \"run it hot\" market.\n\nCommodities are the top run-it-hot trade heading into next year, Bank of America strategists wrote in a note in December.\n\nOil and energy are also favorable investments under the run-it-hot regime, they added.\n\n\"Trump runs it hot, oil bounces post Russia-Ukraine fix, China keeps yuan cheap, soon all the commodity charts will look like gold,\" strategists wrote. \"We say long commodities the best 'run it hot' trade in '26, and long despised oil/energy without question the best 'run-it-hot' contrarian trade.\"\n\nCyclical assets — which, by definition, tend to do well when the economy is expanding — are likely to benefit from the macro picture next year, Goldman Sachs said.\n\nThe bank pointed to areas like housing and consumer-facing sides of the market, which include consumer discretionary and retail stocks.\n\n\"After a patch of worry in November, cyclical assets—including cyclical equities and copper—have been rallying again. But even after these recent moves, we think our more optimistic growth views are not fully reflected in markets,\" the bank wrote.\n\nMorgan Stanley thinks consumer discretionary goods investments fall into the \"run it hot\" investing playbook. The bank noted that firms generally have higher pricing power today, which should boost revenue growth.\n\nThat dynamic is already playing out in the discretionary goods sector, strategists said. The rate for top-line earnings beats in the sector for the third quarter clocked in at 6%, above the 2% rate for the overall S&P 500, per Morgan Stanley's analysis.\n\nSmall-cap stocks also look attractive, with earnings and pricing power in the sector poised to accelerate heading into next year, Morgan Stanley added.\n\n\"On the earnings front, the two most important aspects of our constructive call are the return of (1) positive operating leverage and (2) pricing power. This combination is especially impactful for the small cap earnings recovery we foresee into 2026,\" the bank's strategists added.\n\nForecasters at Bank of America and Goldman Sachs have also issued bullish calls on small-cap stocks heading into 2026, largely because valuations in the sector are more attractive than in areas such as mega-cap tech stocks.",

    "fullText": "Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing for his annual televised Q&A session, and a new poll shows Russians remain focused on two issues: the war and the economy.\n\nAccording to a poll of 1,608 Russians conducted by the independent Levada Center, the top two concerns Russians want to raise with Putin are when the war will end and how they're supposed to cope with a deteriorating economy.\n\nAbout a fifth of respondents said they would ask Putin when the war in Ukraine, which the Kremlin calls a \"special military operation,\" would end.\n\nRight behind the war is the economy, as another 16% say their top question is about living standards — salaries, pensions, and benefits.\n\nThese two concerns have topped Levada's polls ahead of Putin's annual Q&A for three years.\n\nBeyond the top concerns, Levada found that 8% of respondents want to ask Putin about price growth and tax hikes, 6% about utilities and social services, and 5% about the healthcare system.\n\nThe anxiety comes as Russia's inflation remains high, and the country's massive defense spending jostles with social spending.\n\nPutin's televised \"Direct Line\" Q&A session, scheduled for Friday, comes nearly four years after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, triggering sweeping Western sanctions.\n\nSince the invasion in February 2022, the Kremlin has steered the country onto a wartime economic footing.\n\nHeavy defense spending and state-directed investment have helped sustain headline economic growth, even as sanctions and export restrictions have reshaped trade flows.\n\nBut strains are showing: Energy export revenues have dropped in a softer oil-price environment, while high inflation continues to sap consumer demand.\n\nPrevious hourslong \"Direct Line\" broadcasts offer a preview of how Putin may handle the questions the Kremlin allows.\n\nLast year, Putin acknowledged that Russia's economy was overheating amid high inflation and warned citizens to brace for continued pressure.\n\nHowever, he deflected blame, suggesting that both the central bank and the Russian federal government — formally headed by the prime minister — could have acted more decisively to prevent the surge in prices and credit growth.\n\nPutin is also expected to hold an end-of-year news conference on Friday, where the spotlight will be on any signals he offers about the direction of the war.",

    "fullText": "The year-over-year inflation rate slowed to 2.7% in November, down from 3% in September, the last month for which data is available.\n\nEconomists expected a 3.1% rate, which would have been the highest since May 2024.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics won't be able to calculate an overall consumer price index for October 2025 because the government shutdown that lasted from October to roughly mid-November affected data collection.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a press conference earlier this month that inflation and the labor market data would be \"distorted\" and should be viewed with a \"skeptical eye.\"\n\nThe Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.6% from a year ago in November, below the 3% forecast and the 3% year-over-year rise in September.\n\nThe food index also increased by 2.6% over the year in November, which is lower than the 3.1% rise in September. Food away from home, such as at restaurants, rose more quickly than food at home, such as groceries, increasing by 3.7% and 1.9%, respectively.\n\nThe shelter index, which had generally been rising at a slower rate, rose 3% year over year in November, far below September's 3.6% increase.\n\nEarlier this week, the BLS also published October and November job growth data, as well as last month's unemployment rate, providing more clarity to the state of the economy after a murky data picture due to delayed or canceled government data releases. This delayed report revealed a mixed labor market, characterized by better-than-expected job growth, unemployment rate above that in September, and slowing wage growth.\n\nBoth reports will be helpful for the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision. Before the CPI release, CME FedWatch showed a roughly 75% chance that the Fed would hold rates steady, after three straight cuts, and about a 25% chance of a 25-basis-point cut. The probabilities didn't change that much after the release, shifting to about 71% and about 29%, respectively.\n\n\"Today's low inflation reading won't move the needle for the Fed given how noisy the data is,\" Kay Haigh, global cohead of Fixed Income and Liquidity Solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee members, who make the federal funds rate decision, won't meet again until January 27 and January 28, so they will have even more labor market and inflation information before then to make their call.\n\n\"All told this is a positive report, that comes with an asterisk. Subsequent CPI's will likely smooth out the statistical errors that might have been present in today's report,\" Art Hogan, chief market strategist for B. Riley Wealth, said.",

    "fullText": "Stock investors got two pieces of good news on Thursday.\n\nUS stocks jumped as investors took in a cooler-than-expected inflation report, bolstering confidence in the economy and lifting hopes that the Fed will continue its rate-cutting cycle heading into next year.\n\nConsumer prices rose 2.7% year-over-year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, lower than the 3.1% annualized increase economists were expecting.\n\nMeanwhile, the tech sector got a break after days of weakness. Chip stocks, led largely by Micron Technology, which jumped as much as 14%. The chipmaker reported strong earnings and issued robust guidance, helping to erase some losses from Wednesday's session.\n\nMajor indexes rose in the early morning and surged on the CPI release. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose more than 1%.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Thursday:\n\nHere were the other notable moves in the tech sector:\n\nThe latest CPI data is a much-needed piece of good news for the market, which has been under pressure as investors take stock of high valuations and sort through their queasy feelings about the AI sector.\n\nCooler inflation, combined with a weaker US job market, has widened the path for the Fed to continue its cutting rates in 2026. The odds that the central bank will cut rates another 25 basis points by March edged higher after the CPI data.\n\nThe 10-year US Treasury yield dropped to around 4.1% on Thursday.\n\n\"The inflation bump from tariffs is behind us, so the path is now clear for the Fed to lower rates again in January. There is no longer a case for restrictive monetary policy,\" Jamie Cox, a managing partner at Harris Financial Group, said in a statement.\n\nStephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate, said the latest CPI reading suggested the Fed may already be ahead of its inflation targets for the next year.\n\n\"The numbers this morning helped support the Fed narrative that the risks to the job market were rising faster than the risks to inflation,\" Scott Helfstein, the head of investment strategy at Global X, wrote in a note.\n\nMicron, meanwhile, soothed investors' anxieties in the AI sector, as the chipmaker reported $13.6 billion in revenue, exceeding the $12.8 billion Wall Street had expected.\n\nThe company said that it expects to pull around $18.7 billion in revenue for the current quarter, higher than the $14.2 billion analysts had pencilled in.\n\nInvestors are interpreting the results as another bit of evidence that AI chip demand is still strong. The news is quelling some anxiety over massive amounts of spending being poured into AI, which sparked a sell-off yesterday on a Financial Times report that said Blue Owl Capital had backed out of a $10 billion data center deal with Oracle.\n\n\"MU's double-digit percentage pre-market gain has investors breathing a sigh of relief, but you can't fault anyone for being a little cynical after seeing how some other AI-related stocks recently performed in reaction to what, at face value, looked like impressive reports,\" Paul Hickey, the co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, said.",

They are also trying to secure deals with flag-carrying countries to make it easier to board the vessels.\n\nEU headquarters said the businessmen “control vessels transporting crude oil or petroleum products, originating in Russia or being exported from Russia, concealing the actual origin of the oil, while practicing irregular and high-risk shipping practices.”\n\nThe four shipping companies targeted are based in the United Arab Emirates, Vietnam and Russia. A statement said they own or manage shadow fleet tankers under sanctions and which transport oil “while practicing irregular and high-risk shipping practices.”\n\nThe sanctions, which were agreed at a meeting of the 27-nation bloc's foreign ministers in Brussels, involve mostly asset freezes and travel bans.\n\nThe EU move adds to growing pressure on the shadow fleet. Last month, Ukraine used domestically produced Sea Baby naval drones to strike two more Russian oil tankers in the Black Sea. Both were under international sanctions.\n\nSeparately, the bloc imposed sanctions on members of Russia’s military intelligence agency, GRU, and a hacking group known as Cadet Blizzard, accusing them of cyber attacks targeting Ukraine, the EU and unnamed NATO allies.\n\nThe EU also added a number of foreign policy analysts and influencers accused of promoting pro-Russian propaganda or conspiracy theories to its sanctions list.",

The biggest updates will be November jobs and inflation data, two of the biggest focuses for investors in recent months as they try to chart the path for Fed rate cuts heading into the new year.\n\nMajor indexes were volatile as Monday trading kicked off, edging higher before giving up some gains.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood around 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Wednesday:\n\nHere's a run-down of the economic data investors will be getting this week:\n\nThe strength of the job market has been front and center for the Fed, which cut rates another 25 basis-points last week and suggested that it would focus its efforts on supporting the labor market as opposed to keeping a lid on inflation.\n\nThis jobs report is expected to come into particular focus, given that the November data was delayed due to the government shutdown.\n\nThe market looks to be in a \"bad is good regime,\" analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note on Monday, referring to how weak jobs data can be bullish for stocks as it tees up expectations for more monetary policy easing.\n\n\"This week's jobs data could be more important for equities' perception of interest rate policy going forward than last week's FOMC meeting,\" the bank wrote. \"This implies that moderate labor market weakness is likely to be viewed in a bullish context by equity markets.\"\n\nThursday's inflation report could also feed into rate-cut expectations.\n\n\"Thursday's delayed CPI report provides a much needed update on how inflation has fared in recent months. The market is still hungry for inflation data even as it appears that the Fed is more focused on the labor market at this time,\" Rick Gardner, the CIO at RGA Investments, wrote in a note on Monday.\n\nThe economic releases will be supplemented by a lineup of Fed speakers this week, who are expected to provide insight into the path of monetary policy heading into next year. Here's the list of central bankers:\n\nInvestors think a rate cut is certain at the Fed's January policy meeting, and are pricing in a 26% probability that the central bank could issue a jumbo-sized 50 basis-point rate cut that month, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nStill, stocks have been struggling to move meaningfully higher after a rough performance in November. The tech sector remains under pressure as investors assess high valuations and fret over a potential AI bubble.\n\n\"Friday's selloff suggests that investors are taking some profits in tech stocks and reallocating money into value-oriented stocks. This rotation is not surprising, especially as we head into year-end,\" RGA's Gardner added.",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nFor many Americans, retirement isn’t just about getting by — it’s about living comfortably and maintaining a middle-class lifestyle.\n\nEarning $12,000 a month ($144,000 a year) in passive income, for instance, could make that possible, covering everyday expenses while still allowing for travel, dining out and other luxuries.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nBut reaching that level of income in retirement requires more than just a large nest egg. Your savings must also be resilient enough to handle inflation, market swings and the risk of outliving your money.\n\nThe financial bar for this kind of retirement is likely higher than most people expect. Here’s why.\n\nRetiring on $144,000 isn’t typical. In 2025, the “magic number” for retirement savings is $1.26 million, according to a Northwestern Mutual study (1). Using the standard 4% rule, that equates to about $50,400 per year — or $4,200 per month in retirement income.\n\nThat figure aligns closely with the median retirement income of $54,710 for Americans over 65, based on 2023 U.S. Census Bureau data (2).\n\nThat’s already a steep target, but it only scratches the surface. Once you factor in inflation and longevity risk, the bar climbs even higher.\n\nIf you’re hoping to achieve three times the average retirement income, you may benefit from working with an advisor. People who work with financial advisors see a 3% increase in net returns, according to a report from Vanguard.\n\nThe advisors at Range offer white-glove financial services to high-income households.\n\nOnce your equity enters this ballpark, one of the most significant financial pain points can be asset under management (AUM) fees. These fees mean that portfolio managers take a percentage of the value, typically between 0.5% and 2%, of your managed assets — so as your wealth grows, so do their fees.",

    "fullText": "The Fed cut interest rates for the third time this year on Wednesday, and the meeting held some key takeaways for how the central bank is thinking about the economy heading into 2026.\n\nFrom the labor market to inflation to stocks, here's everything to know about the latest Fed decision.\n\nFed leaders anticipate more economic growth in 2026 and stable unemployment levels, but are somewhat concerned about slowing labor demand and participation. Lower rates could help juice hiring, Powell said.\n\nIn terms of AI, the Fed chair said chatbots are not yet replacing jobs — even as Corporate America sees shrinking while collar roles. \"It's part of the story, but it's not a big part of the story yet,\" he said. And, though some Big Tech firms and major retailers, have had high-profile cuts in 2025, Powell added that overall layoff rates are still relatively low.\n\nThe figure remains slightly above the Fed's 2% goal, though data is limited due to the government shutdown. With lower rates, there's a risk consumer prices will rise too. At the same time, Powell said consumer spending has been strong and the main driver of inflation right now is tariff policy, not broad economic weakness.\n\nIt was a hawkish rate cut overall, but markets rallied sharply anyway.\n\nThe S&P 500 edged up to a near-record close and the Dow jump almost 500 points, adding to gains as Powell's press conference got going. A few things came out of the meeting that boosted investors' bullishness.\n\nWith Powell's term up in May, Trump is set to name a successor in January.\n\n\"I really want to turn this job over to whoever replaces me with the economy in really good shape,\" he said. \"I want inflation to be back down to 2% and I want the labor market to be strong — that's what I want. All of my efforts are to get to that place.\"\n\nMembers of the Federal Open Market Committee showed significant division on Wednesday, with three members dissenting to the cut call. It's the biggest split seen at a Fed meeting since 2019 and signals ongoing tension between the Fed's dual mandate and how each member weighs employment and inflation risks.\n\nPowell, however, said there's no bad blood.\n\n\"The discussions we have are as good as any we've had in my 14 years at the Fed,\" he said. \"They're very thoughtful and respectful and people have strong views",

    "fullText": "This article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nFederal Reserve officials are set to push through a third consecutive rate cut on Wednesday, yet the debate inside the central bank could be more intense than the headline suggests. After trimming rates twice this autumn and by 1.5 percentage points over the past 15 months the Fed is inching toward levels that could stimulate economic activity, something many policymakers would prefer to avoid. A growing number of officials believe the benchmark may now be sitting at a neutral level that neither accelerates nor restrains growth, creating the possibility of a more divided outcome and, according to several analysts, as many as three dissents.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with AMZN.\n\nIs AMZN fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nThe shutdown that consumed October and most of November has left Powell without timely data to guide the next narrative. Investors will be watching closely as officials release a fresh statement on Wednesday, where the Fed could reiterate that labor-market risks have risen in recent months while inflation remains somewhat elevated. Powell must navigate a wide spectrum of views when he speaks at his press conference, especially with consumer spending showing little change in September and layoffs declining overall, despite high-profile cutbacks from companies including Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Without updated economic readings until mid-December, Powell may have limited room to commit to any firm path forward.\n\nEconomists increasingly think policymakers will pause after this week's move while they evaluate incoming data, and the committee's new projections could underscore just how split the outlook has become. In September, eight officials favored stopping cuts at levels expected after Wednesday's decision, while nine signaled at least two more in 2026. The median outlook could adjust growth for 2025 slightly higher, trim inflation estimates for the end of this year, and nudge unemployment forecasts upward. Powell faces a more fragmented committee, with several regional presidents arguing against further reductions and Fed Governor Stephen Miran expected to dissent again in favor of a larger half-point cut. Investors are now looking toward the White House, where President Donald Trump is weighing his choice to succeed Powell when his term expires in May, and Kevin Hassett is widely viewed as a leading contender.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will road-test his claims that he's tackling Americans' affordability woes at a Tuesday rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania — shifting an argument made in Oval Office appearances and social media posts to a campaign-style event.\n\nThe trip comes as polling consistently shows that public trust in Trump's economic leadership has faltered. Following dismal results for Republicans in last month's off-cycle elections, the White House has sought to convince voters that the economy will emerge stronger next year and that any anxieties over inflation have nothing to do with Trump.\n\nThe president has consistently blamed his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, for inflation even as his own aggressive implementation of policies has pushed up prices that had been settling down after spiking in 2022 to a four-decade high. Inflation began to accelerate after Trump announced his sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs in April. Companies warned that the import taxes could be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices and reduced hiring, yet Trump continues to insist that inflation has faded.\n\n“We’re bringing prices way down,\" Trump said at the White House on Monday. “You can call it ‘affordability’ or anything you want — but the Democrats caused the affordability problem, and we’re the ones that are fixing it.”\n\nThe president's reception in the county hosting his Tuesday rally could give a signal of just how much voters trust his claims. Monroe County flipped to Trump in the 2024 election after having backed Biden in 2020, helping the Republican to win the swing state of Pennsylvania and return to the White House after a four-year hiatus.\n\nAs home to the Pocono Mountains, the county has largely relied on tourism for skiing, hiking, hunting and other activities as a source of jobs. Its proximity to New York City — under two hours by car — has also attracted people seeking more affordable housing.\n\nIt's also an area that could help decide control of the House in next year's midterm elections.\n\nTrump is holding his rally in a congressional district held by freshman Republican Rep. Rob Bresnahan, who is a top target of Democrats and won his 2024 race by about 1.5 percentage points, among the nation’s closest. Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti, a Democrat, is running for the nomination to challenge him.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is running digital ads during Trump's visit on the Wilkes-Barre Times-Leader website that criticize Bresnahan for his stock trading while in Congress and suggest that Trump has not as promised addressed double-dealing in Washington.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Susie Wiles said on the online conservative talk show “The Mom View” that Trump would be on the “campaign trail” next year to engage supporters who otherwise might sit out a congressional race.\n\nWiles, who helped manage Trump's 2024 campaign, said most administrations try to localize midterm elections and keep the president out of the race, but she intends to do the opposite of that.\n\n“We’re actually going to turn that on its head,\" Wiles said, \"and put him on the ballot because so many of those low-propensity voters are Trump voters.”\n\nWiles added, “So I haven’t quite broken it to him yet, but he’s going to campaign like it’s 2024 again.”\n\nThe challenge for Trump is how to address the concerns of voters about the economy while simultaneously claiming that the economy is enjoying an historic boom.\n\nAsked on a Politico podcast about how he'd rate the economy, Trump leaned into the grade inflation by answering “A-plus,” only to then amend his answer to “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.”\n\nTrump has said he's giving consumers relief by relaxing fuel efficiency standards for autos and signing agreements to reduce list prices on prescription drugs.\n\nTrump has also advocated for cuts to the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate — which influences the supply of money in the U.S. economy. He argues that would reduce the cost of mortgages and auto loans, although critics warn that cuts of the scale sought by Trump could instead worsen inflation.\n\nThe U.S. economy has shown signs of resilience with the stock market up this year and overall growth looking solid for the third quarter. But many Americans see the prices of housing, groceries, education, electricity and other basic needs as swallowing up their incomes, a dynamic that the Trump administration has said it expects to fade next year with more investments in artificial intelligence and manufacturing.\n\nSince the elections in November when Democrats won key races with a focus on kitchen table issues, Trump has often dismissed the concerns about prices as a “hoax” and a “con job” to suggest that he bears no responsibility for inflation, even though he campaigned on his ability to quickly bring down prices. Just 33% of U.S. adults approve of Trump's handling of the economy, according to a November survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nLevy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",

    "description": "Jerome Powell will soon announce the next Fed decision on a potential interest rate cut. The Fed is missing key economic data on jobs and inflation.",
    "fullText": "The Federal Reserve has one more decision in 2025 — and it will set the tone for where interest rates will go in the new year.\n\nOn Wednesday, leaders at the central bank will decide whether to continue cutting rates or put a pause on loosening monetary policy. The call will have ripple effects across consumer prices, the job market, and Corporate America. CME FedWatch predicted the Fed had a roughly 90% chance of a quarter-point cut on Monday.\n\nBut slicing rates isn't a sure thing. The final Federal Open Market Committee meeting of 2025 will follow the record-long government shutdown, which upended job stability for federal workers and disrupted data releases, including on unemployment and inflation. Even with the government open again, federal agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics continue to delay or have canceled their reports. It leaves the Fed's decision makers without a full picture of US economic health.\n\n\"The risk to the labor market's still there, the risks to inflation are still there, neither of which are necessarily a cause for alarm right now,\" Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, told Business Insider, but \"the picture is cloudy.\"\n\nFed leaders are missing some key job and price data. Because BLS didn't collect new data during the shutdown, the agency can't publish the October consumer price index report or the October unemployment rate, and the November jobs report and inflation data won't be released in time for the December meeting.\n\nRenter said the murky economic picture may mean the Fed leans on last-minute data reports to make its decision. The job openings and labor turnover survey results and the employment cost index will be released on December 9 and December 10, respectively.\n\nThe delayed September jobs report that came out on November 20 showed that the US added more jobs than expected that month, and unemployment increased amid an increase in labor force participation. Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, told Business Insider that this doesn't mean the job market is reinvigorated or that the Fed's concerns over the labor market would immediately fade.\n\n\"We're still off to one of the worst starts we've had since 2010 after you take out the pandemic,\" Stahle said. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in the last FOMC press conference that labor market conditions had \"not changed much\" between the Fed's September and October meetings.\n\nClaudia Sahm, the chief economist for New Century Advisors, expects the Fed to cut rates again, but wouldn't be surprised if members then decide to hold off for a while to see how the economy evolves. She also said there hasn't been much progress on cooling US inflation this year. After another cut to help with the job market, she expects a wait-and-see period before another rate cut, assuming there aren't drastic labor market changes.\n\n\"I have a feeling that if all goes well in the economy, the Fed probably is not going to be doing a whole lot because they took steps right now to ensure against the worst outcomes,\" Sahm said. \"Then it's just going to take time for the inflation to start moving back down.\"\n\nThe Fed has kept monetary policy restrictive so far this year, holding rates steady until September. But not all Fed leaders agree. Minutes from recent meetings show that some FOMC members would prefer larger and more consistent interest rate cuts. It's possible that monetary strategy could change in 2026, as Powell's term ends in May. President Donald Trump — who has been a vocal advocate for rate cuts — is likely to nominate a new Fed chair in January.\n\nA third consecutive cut would help make major purchases more affordable.\n\nThirty-year fixed mortgages, two-year auto loans, and credit card rates tend to fluctuate alongside the federal funds rate. And, while inflation remains above the Fed's 2% goal, mortgage rates have largely cooled in recent months in anticipation of rate reductions.\n\nA quarter-point cut could mean lower returns on investment for savers using high-yield savings accounts or certificates of deposit, though it would become cheaper to pay off credit cards. Lower rates would also make home equity lines and small business loans more accessible to Americans.\n\nIf there is a cut, Renter said it could be a positive sign for people applying to roles in the sluggish labor market: If job seekers \"hear that the Fed is responding to an unfavorable labor market, that's going to feel good to them; they may feel like relief is on the horizon,\" she said.\n\nSustained rate cuts would bolster the job market by making it easier for businesses to borrow and invest money. This would free up more funds for companies to hire and pay employees, which could lead to higher consumer spending — all factors needed for a healthy economy.\n\nThough Powell said the Fed will be careful to balance jobs goals with curbing inflation. A rate change is likely this week, but \"not a foregone conclusion, far from it,\" he said. \"Policy is not on a preset course.\"",
