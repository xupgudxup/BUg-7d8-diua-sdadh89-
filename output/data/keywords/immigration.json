    "title": "Rich Western countries face a stark choice: 6-day workweeks or more immigration, top economist warns",
    "description": "One of the world's foremost economists, Lant Pritchett, has a plan.",
    "fullText": "Eva is a fellow on Fortune's news desk.\n\nA specter is haunting Europe—the specter of aging.\n\nMany Western countries are facing what the World Bank calls a “profound demographic crisis.” The twin perils of an aging population and record-low fertility rates are predicted to send their populations plunging in the coming decades.\n\nThe worst consequences of this demographic shift, per the World Bank, are economic. Soon the shrinking working population in the U.S., Canada, or Germany won’t be able to meet their own constant demands for high-quality goods and services. These rich, senescent countries will have to make a hard choice for economic survival: force people to work more, or allow immigrants to fill in?\n\nLant Pritchett, one of the world’s top thinkers on developmental economics, has seen this crisis coming for decades over his career at Harvard, the World Bank, and Oxford University, where he currently heads a research lab. He told Fortune his radical plan to stave off economic disaster.\n\nIn the long run, without intervention, the UN predicts a decline in population growth could cascade into a full-on population “collapse.” That collapse is not likely to occur until well into the next century—if it comes at all. However, in the short run, population decline presents a real and relatively simple economic problem: The West soon won’t have enough workers.\n\nThe ratio of working-age people to elderly people in rich countries will soon become so diminished that support for elders will be unaffordable. In Japan, a nation already facing the consequences of a graying population, the average cost of nursing care is projected to increase 75% in the next 30 years, with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida warning the nation is on “the brink.” In the U.S., think tanks have warned, an older population with more retirees means a shrinking tax base and higher demands on programs like Social Security and Medicare, along with a smaller number of working-age people to pay into those programs.\n\nIn short, we have a “ticking time bomb” on our hands, in the words of Greece’s Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, whose government introduced a six-day workweek last year to address the nation’s labor shortages. The move prompted fury and protests among workers as they watched their German and Belgian cousins embrace four-day workweeks.\n\nIndeed, even as some European countries and a few American companies flirt with working less, panicked economists and politicians are sounding the alarm: We need to work more. A study conducted by consulting firm Korn Ferry found by 2030, there will be a global human talent shortage of more than 85 million people, roughly equivalent to the population of Germany. That talent shortage could slash $8.5 trillion from nations’ expected revenues, affecting highly educated sectors such as financial services and IT as well as manufacturing jobs, which are considered “lower skilled” and require less education.\n\nNow is the time to act, economic veteran Pritchett told Fortune. But doing so involves some radical rethinking of the current immigration debate.\n\nClassical economics offers a number of ways to address a labor shortage, Pritchett said. Since most of the unfilled jobs are “unskilled,” or don’t require a degree to complete, one solution for businesses and governments is to invest in automation, essentially having robots fill the gap. But while automation helps get the jobs done, it depresses human workers’ wages by decreasing the number of jobs available, “exacerbating” the issue, Pritchett said.\n\nSome have called for increasing wages to induce more people to work. But most of the working-age population in the U.S. is already employed. Despite a well-documented decline in the portion of working-age men with jobs over the past few decades, Pritchett said the vast majority of working-age men are working, meaning raising pay would have small effects at best. There’s room for more women to work, he noted, but that could take away from other important responsibilities that are overwhelmingly shunted to women, such as caring for family or raising children.\n\nThat leaves two other options: forcing workers to work more or allowing an influx of legal, controlled immigration.\n\nMitsotakis’s plan for a six-day workweek is a step in the right direction for the short term, Pritchett said.\n\nBut “economics is not just about direction: It’s about magnitude,” he added. In other words, he says, small policy tweaks won’t do it. If we’re trying to address a big, structural problem with the U.S. labor force, the solution needs to be ambitious and comprehensive—precisely the type of legislation American politicians have largely avoided in recent years.\n\nIf policymakers simply try to make everyone work an additional day, the math simply won’t work out in the long run, Pritchett said. Even if Greece has “fantastic success” and increases its working hours by 10% over the next 30 years, that growth would represent a “drop in the bucket” in fighting a worsening labor shortage. He calculated a demographic labor force gap of 232 million people globally in his most recent paper, even assuming the highest possible labor force participation rate.\n\n“You can’t solve a problem that’s growing over time with [a labor force] that has an upward bound,” he said. You would have to keep the labor force working more and more, and even then, you would never be able to fill in the gap.\n\nPritchett has a better idea. He knows the current immigration debate is fraught, since the West is concerned with the social ramifications of allowing more migrants into its borders. But he maintains the only way to solve rich countries’ labor problem is to let in immigrants to work, particularly from countries where population growth is increasing, such as Nigeria or Tanzania, rather than decreasing.\n\nIn his view, the Western debate on immigration has taken on an unnecessarily binary flavor, with the choice depicted as one between a path to citizenship or closed borders. In an article titled “The political acceptability of time-limited labor mobility,” Pritchett says the West will soon have to abandon this view. Instead, he advocates for developed nations to embrace a system where immigrants can come to their country to work for a limited time—while also buying goods and services, renting homes, starting companies, and hiring workers—and then go back home, leaving both parties wealthier.\n\nThe truth, Pritchett said, is the U.S. needs low-skilled migrants, and many migrants need the economic boost from working in the U.S. Immigration is a symbiotic relationship that the West cannot quit—that’s why it’s so hard for us to actually control our borders.\n\n“The way to secure the border is to create a legitimate way for people and firms to get the labor that the economy really needs in legitimate, legal ways, and until we have that, the whole debate over the wall and stuff is just silly,” Pritchett said.\n\nIf anything, the intensifying crackdown on undocumented and legal migration since the late 1980s has led to mass settlement, according to Hein de Haas, a sociologist of immigration. Prior to the 1980s, the U.S. and Mexico enjoyed a relationship similar to the work-visa program Pritchett envisions. Mexicans freely flowed across the border, coming for a short time to work, returning home to enjoy their money, and sometimes repeating this journey over several years, Haas wrote. They never permanently settled because, knowing they could come and go as they pleased, they did not have to.\n\nThe U.S. facilitated this temporary migration programs specifically aimed at Mexicans,  encouraging contract workers to come to the U.S. after  World War I and II. The second of these, the Bracero Program, established a treaty for the temporary employment of Mexican farmworkers in the U.S., and was so popular that it was extended far beyond its initial life span, allowing nearly 5 million Mexicans to temporarily work in the U.S. from 1942 to 1964. (The program ended in 1965, when the U.S. sharply limited immigration from Latin America as part of a major overhaul of immigration laws.)\n\nWhat Pritchett suggests isn’t too dissimilar from simply turning the clock back to a time when migrants could move and work freely. He proposes a fixed-term system: A worker comes to the U.S. with the understanding that they are not on a path to citizenship, works on a three-year contract, and then returns to their home country. After an “off period” of six months to a year, the migrant could come back for another three years.\n\n“There are a billion people on the planet who would come to the U.S. under those terms,” Pritchett said. “But we don’t have that available.”\n\nHe isn’t exaggerating about the billion. In a 2010 survey, Gallup asked people around the world whether they would like to temporarily move to work in another country. Some 1.1 billion responded “yes,” including 41% of the age 15-to-24 population and 28% of those ages 25-44, Pritchett said.\n\n“What you could make in America in three years and go back to Senegal with is a fortune compared to anything else you could do to make your way in Senegal,” he added. “You go back to Senegal, you build a house, you buy your own business, and you’ve transformed your life by working temporarily.”\n\nTo avoid potential labor shortages in sending nations, Pritchett’s system would depend on bilateral agreements between the host and sending countries, and nations “could choose to put limits on their participation” to address their own labor needs, Pritchett said.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. would receive fresh batches of workers for service industries, elderly care, or manufacturing—essentially, all the jobs that would be otherwise unfilled.\n\nPolicies like these are not yet being discussed on the national stage, but Pritchett believes that will soon change. With the upcoming labor shortage and the unpopularity of forcing workers to toil for longer, politicians will have to expand their understanding of immigration to allow for policies like his. For now, he’s planting the seed.\n\nIn partnership with economist Rebekah Smith, Pritchett has started an organization called Labor Mobility Partnerships (LaMP) that aims to build political support for a temporary rotational migration system. The way he sees it, nothing will change by pitching the idea to politicians (“who tend to be followers, not leaders”) so instead, he is working with countries that are currently already expanding their immigration channels, like Spain.\n\nHe is also courting business leaders in sectors that will be the hardest hit by labor shortages, such as elderly care, who could “be potentially a powerful force” in explaining to politicians why policies like his are necessary.\n\n“Ideas at times are like dams: huge, unmoving, impregnable, able to hold the water back forever,” Pritchett writes in the conclusion of his paper. “But a small, strategically placed crack can cause a dam to be washed away overnight.”\n\nA version of this story was published on Fortune.com on Aug. 4, 2024.",

    "fullText": "CASABLANCA, Morocco (AP) — Exposure to freezing temperatures near Morocco’s border with Algeria killed nine African migrants, a tragedy that rights groups in the North African country called deeply concerning and a violation of the right to freedom of movement.\n\nThe bodies of seven men and two women were found in Ras Asfour, a remote mountainous Moroccan area known for its plunging temperatures in winter, the Moroccan Association of Human Rights said Saturday in a statement.\n\n“They died from extreme cold, which their exhausted bodies could not withstand,” it said.\n\nOne of the migrants was from Guinea, the group said. The rest were from various countries throughout sub-Saharan Africa, though specific information about their identities remains unknown. Morocco’s Interior Ministry did not immediately respond to questions about the individuals who died.\n\nEvery year, thousands of migrants seeking better living conditions attempt to crossing illegal from North Africa to Europe, including from Morocco to Spain. Some aim for Ceuta and Melilla – two tiny Spanish enclaves in North Africa – by scaling border fences or swimming. Others attempt to reach Spain’s Canary Islands, taking a longer route through the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe North African nation’s security forces regularly report blocking such attempts.\n\nThroughout Europe and Africa, North Africa is known as a transit point for migrants en route to Europe’s southern border.\n\nSecurity agreements with the European Union have strengthen authorities' ability to deter migration in North Africa. Many who originally intended to migrate to Europe spend months or years working informally — doing construction, agriculture or domestic work. Others rely on aid while waiting for opportunities to cross the Mediterranean Sea or Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe Moroccan Association of Human Rights statement said six of the bodies were buried last week and two were kept at the request of their relatives. “We will make sure that this case is followed up on,” it said.\n\nThe Moroccan Organization of Human Rights — a different association — earlier this week called for the humanization of borders, the decriminalization of illegal migration and residence, and the creation of a mechanism to track missing migrants to prevent tragedies like the one in Ras Asfour.\n\nFollow AP’s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",

    "fullText": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia must be freed from immigration detention while he fights his deportation, a judge ruled Thursday, handing a major victory to the immigrant whose wrongful deportation to a notorious prison in El Salvador made him a flashpoint of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement to let Abrego Garcia go immediately, writing that federal authorities had detained him again after his return to the United States without any legal basis.\n\n“For this reason, the Court will GRANT Abrego Garcia’s Petition for immediate release from ICE custody,” the judge wrote.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security sharply criticized the decision and vowed to appeal, calling the ruling “naked judicial activism” by a judge appointed during the Obama administration.\n\n“This order lacks any valid legal basis, and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary. The judge gave prosecutors until 5 p.m. EST to formally respond to the release order.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment, and messages seeking comment from Abrego Garcia’s attorney were not immediately returned.\n\nAbrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national with an American wife and child, has lived in Maryland for years but entered the U.S. illegally as a teenager. An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that he could not be deported to El Salvador because he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family. When he was mistakenly sent there in March, his case became a rallying point for those who oppose President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement actions.\n\nA court later ordered his return to the United States. Since he cannot be removed to El Salvador, ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries. His federal suit claims the Trump administration is illegally using the removal process to punish Abrego Garcia for the public embarrassment caused by his deportation.\n\nIn her order releasing Abrego Garcia, Xinis wrote that federal authorities “did not just stonewall” the court, “They affirmatively misled the tribunal.” The judge was referencing the successive list of four African countries that officials had sought to remove Abrego Garcia seemingly without commitments from those countries, as well as officials' affirmations that Costa Rica withdrew its offer to accept him, a claim later proven untrue.\n\n“But Costa Rica had never wavered in its commitment to receive Abrego Garcia, just as Abrego Garcia never wavered in his commitment to resettle there,” the judge wrote.\n\nXinis also rejected the government’s argument that she lacked jurisdiction to intervene on a final removal order for Abrego Garcia, because she found no final order had been filed.\n\nSeparately, Abrego Garcia is asking an immigration court to reopen his case so he can seek asylum in the United States.\n\nHe is also criminally charged in Tennessee, where he has pleaded not guilty to human smuggling. He has asked the federal court to dismiss the case, arguing the prosecution is vindictive. His defense attorney in Tennessee, Sean Hecker, declined to comment.\n\nA judge in that case has ordered an evidentiary hearing after previously finding some evidence that the charges “may be vindictive.” The judge also noted several statements by Trump administration officials that “raise cause for concern,” including a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that seemed to suggest the Justice Department charged Abrego Garcia because he won his wrongful deportation case. ___\n\nLoller reported from Nashville, Seewer reported from Toledo, Ohio and Lauer reported from Philadelphia.

    "description": "Amanda...",
    "fullText": "In a text exchange, Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino calls his operation a “massive disturbance” in the making.\n\n“Operation Catahoula Crunch is making New Orleans safer by finding and arresting illegal aliens who have been endangering this community,” Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino posted on X shortly after his roving corps of immigration enforcers arrived in the city. In a similar PR offensive, the Department of Homeland Security recently launched the “Worst of the Worst” website, which features some of the arrests that the federal agents implementing the Trump White House’s mass deportation policy have carried out across the country. (The legal resolution of these arrests, like the 13 cases dropped in court after Bovino’s Operation Midway Blitz campaign in Chicago, are not featured.)\n\nAnd despite the online efforts to portray the Trump raids as heroic peacekeeping exercises, Commander Bovino’s New Orleans team seemed to be operating by a different set of rules, to judge by its conduct this past Saturday. A caravan of Louisiana state troopers escorted three rental cars full of federal agents, including Bovino himself, to an apartment complex in Kenner, Louisiana. A secondary caravan, made up mostly of journalists and protesters, followed close behind. State police blocked off a road in the complex, driving both groups out of their vehicles and into the street, where Bovino and his agents could move in on them. The federal agents slowly drove down the road, stopping for minutes at a time. The small group of protesters grew, bolstered by neighbors who lived in the apartments.\n\nSafe inside an SUV, surrounded by agents with weapons, Bovino texted away on his phone from the parking lot of an apartment complex. The messages, recorded by journalist Ford Fischer, offer some insight—into both Bovino’s mind and the state of the Louisiana operation.\n\n“Kind of cool we are a massive wrecking crew. The idiots can’t do anything to us…. I can’t understand why DHS is hiding us when we are handing them strategy on a silver platter,” Bovino wrote to a contact listed as “Diz.” Minutes later, Bovino followed up with a summary of their on-the-ground strategy that afternoon: “Massive disturbance at apartment complex in Kenner. We are running tags and such.”\n\nThe “disturbance” was hardly massive. The protesters were yelling at the agents as they sat in their vehicles with the windows up, but they didn’t offer any physical resistance. After running the tags of the cars down the length of the road, Border Patrol agents got out and knocked on a door. The sound of whistles pierced the air, and one loud protester yelled out for his neighbors not to open their doors: “They cannot come in if you do not give them verbal, allowed permission.”\n\nThe stunt seemed to be a way to agitate the neighborhood more than anything else. And the photos showing Bovino’s messages cast the operation’s alleged legal aims into further doubt. Just for starters, why would a targeted enforcement operation rely on running tags in the parking lot of an apartment complex located in the town with the highest Hispanic population in the state of Louisiana? This seemed to be a “Kavanaugh stop”—the practice of racially profiling residents recently sanctioned by the US Supreme Court—running on steroids.\n\nBovino’s reference to the DHS’s “hiding” his team raises further questions. It certainly seems at odds with his constant media appearances, and his photo-ops in the snack aisles of gas stations\n\nPerhaps Bovino was simply venting because the New Orleans raids aren’t producing the kind of strong-arm spectacle that he’s staged in Chicago and elsewhere. According to the Associated Press, his team has carried out just 38 arrests over the first four days of Operation Catahoula Crunch. And of the 38 people detained, only nine had criminal records—a percentage that’s generally in line with the national numbers for the immigration raids, which show that more than 70 percent of the people arrested had no criminal convictions.\n\nBovino’s texting partner, at least, seemed to be mindful of the team’s lackluster show of force. “You need to do interviews. Fox and friends wants you. We will come up for a talking point on the low numbers,” Diz texted Bovino.\n\nStill, when he doesn’t feel like he’s being hidden, Commander Bovino remains stoutly on message. “The Big Easy is the Big Hard for illegal aliens,” Bovino bragged this week on X.\n\nOver the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T.
