    "fullText": "(Removes 'downtown' from paragraph 2)\n\nWASHINGTON, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Becky Ringstrom was heading home after following federal immigration officers in her gray Kia SUV in suburban Minneapolis when she was suddenly boxed in by unmarked vehicles. At least a half-dozen masked agents jumped out to arrest her, one knocking on her windshield with a metal object as if threatening to use it to break her window.\n\nAfter the arrest, captured on bystander video verified by Reuters, the 42-year-old mother of seven later said she was transported to Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis where an officer gave her a citation charging her under a ​federal law that criminalizes impeding law enforcement. The official said her name and photo would be added to a government database.\n\nThe arrest of Ringstrom became the latest detention of one of thousands of local activists for violating Title 18, Section 111 of the U.S. Code, a catch-all charge for anyone who “forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes” ‌with a federal officer conducting official duties. The statute can be charged as a felony or misdemeanor. As a felony, it carries up to 20 years in prison, but penalties beyond eight years are reserved for people who use “a deadly or dangerous weapon” or cause an injury.\n\nA Reuters review of federal court records found that the Trump administration has prosecuted at least 655 people under that charge across the U.S. since a series of city-focused immigration crackdowns began last summer. ‌That’s more than double the prosecutions during the same period in 2024-2025, according to a review of publicly available criminal filings in Westlaw, a legal research database owned by Thomson Reuters.\n\nThe charges are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to clamp down on ICE opponents, who they portray as rioters who pose threats to officers and undermine their efforts to arrest immigrants with criminal records.\n\n\"Assaulting and obstructing law enforcement is a felony,\" said U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin. She said federal immigration officers \"used the minimum amount of force necessary to protect themselves, the public, and federal property.\"\n\nICE has been tracking the names of protesters in an internal database for several months, according to two U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss operations.\n\nThe government database contains names, photos, actions that provoked suspicion, locations and license plates, the officials said, adding that the effort was intended to spot patterns that could lead to charges.\n\nDHS said ⁠it does not maintain a database of U.S. “domestic terrorists,” but does track threats. “We do of course monitor and investigate and refer all ‌threats, assaults and obstruction of our officers to the appropriate law enforcement,” McLaughlin said.\n\nOne of the officials said ICE was referring several people per day in Minnesota alone to federal prosecutors for potential charges under the same law for interfering with police operations.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said the Trump administration was committed to protecting First Amendment freedoms, but that people impeding law enforcement \"will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nRingstrom had watched federal immigration officers for about 45 minutes as they sat in a parked car in her neighborhood on Thursday, January 29. When they started to ‍move, she decided to follow along in her SUV, keeping a distance of multiple car lengths behind, she said.\n\nAt a roundabout, a Border Patrol agent approached her car and said, \"Last time I'm going to warn you,\" according to video Ringstrom recorded on her phone.\n\nThe officers went right at a stop sign and she went left, she said. Several minutes later as she started to head back toward her house, multiple vehicles with federal officers stopped and arrested her, she said.\n\n\"I know what I'm doing is not wrong,\" Ringstrom said later in an interview with Reuters.\n\nStill, she said she was terrified when federal officers approached her car. “There was a moment where I thought I could be Renee Good,\" she said, referring to one of the two U.S. citizen protesters fatally shot by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis in January.\n\nAfter her arrest, she was issued a citation, reviewed by Reuters, ​which said the court date was “TBD” - to be determined.\n\nMcLaughlin said Ringstrom \"stalked law enforcement and attempted to obstruct law enforcement from performing their sworn duties.”\n\nSeth Stoughton, a professor focused on policing at University of South Carolina School of Law, said the law in the past mostly has been used to charge assaults on officers and specifically states that the alleged crime must be committed \"forcibly.”\n\n\"Without ‌any physical contact, just following an agent in a car, it's not clear to me that that's resistance or impeding in the first place, and it certainly seems like a stretch to establish that as forcible,\" Stoughton said.\n\nA federal judge in Minneapolis said in a mid-January order that a vehicle following ICE at “an appropriate distance” did not justify a traffic stop or arrest, but that order was paused by an appeals court 10 days later.\n\nThe judge’s now-paused order did not say what exact distance would be deemed safe.\n\nDeborah Fleischaker, a top ICE official under former President Joe Biden, said it was “inappropriate and unconstitutional” to intimidate and arrest people peacefully following immigration officers in their cars.\n\n“Observing ICE activities is not a crime and should not be treated as such,” she said.\n\nMcLaughlin said U.S. Border Patrol agents at the scene gave Ringstrom \"lawful commands and warnings\" but that she continued to obstruct operations, leading to her arrest.\n\n\"When agitators willingly involve themselves and inject themselves in law enforcement operations, they are risking arrest as well as jeopardizing the safety of themselves and those around them,\" McLaughlin said.\n\nVIDEOS SHOW ICE OFFICERS DRAWING WEAPONS\n\nWhile new internal ICE guidance, reported by Reuters in late January, instructed officers not to engage with protesters, the encounters have not stopped.\n\nTwo videos in recent weeks verified by Reuters showed ICE officers drawing their weapons as they approached vehicles that allegedly had been following them.\n\nSouth of Minneapolis on January 29, the same day Ringstrom was arrested, federal immigration officers abruptly swerved, stopped their vehicle and approached a woman driving behind them with guns drawn, according to dashcam footage ⁠from her vehicle first reported by Minnesota Public Radio and verified by Reuters.\n\nMcLaughlin said ICE officers were attempting to arrest a criminal offender when the woman began “stalking and obstructing” them, leading the officers to try to arrest ​her.\n\n“Law enforcement officers attempted to pull her over using their emergency lights to issue her a warning,” McLaughlin said. “Ignoring law enforcement commands, the agitator refused to pull over and began driving recklessly including running stop signs, nearly colliding with ​multiple vehicles, and driving directly at law enforcement in an attempt to ram their vehicle.”\n\nIn a separate incident on February 3, two ICE officers approached a car that had been following them, again, with guns drawn, according to video verified by Reuters and a DHS statement.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the vehicle had been “stalking” and “obstructing” ICE officers.\n\n“The agitators then followed the officers as they departed and made hand motions suggestive of possessing a firearm,” DHS said.\n\nUnder Trump, numerous DHS statements after violent encounters with immigration agents have been inaccurate ⁠or incomplete.\n\nSome Minnesota residents say they believe they are becoming the subject of an intimidation campaign.\n\nIn a suburb north of St. Paul on January 22, an ICE officer led a woman who was following his vehicle back to her house, making it clear that he knew her identity and address, Reuters-verified video filmed by the husband showed.\n\nThe woman’s husband spoke to the ICE officer outside of the couple’s house. When the husband questioned the tactic, the officer said, “You raise your voice, I erase your voice,” the video showed.\n\nOne ICE officer told Reuters they have led people following them back to their houses after running their license plates “to freak them out.”\n\nMcLaughlin said ICE would review body camera ⁠footage and investigate the incident in St. Paul, but did not comment on ICE using the tactic to frighten opponents.\n\nEarlier in January, two friends - Brandon Siguenza and Patty O’Keefe - who were following an ICE vehicle in Minneapolis said officers fired pepper spray into their car, smashed their car window and detained them for eight hours.\n\nMcLaughlin said officers gave them multiple warnings “to stop impeding” operations, but that they “chose to continue to stalk law enforcement and were arrested.”\n\n“The passenger refused to roll ‌down the window and exit the vehicle,” McLaughlin said. “ICE law enforcement followed their training and used the minimum amount of force necessary to make the arrest.”\n\nMcLaughlin did not explicitly confirm that officers broke the car window or deployed pepper spray.\n\nSiguenza and O’Keefe have not been charged.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic leaders say a proposal from the White House is “incomplete and insufficient” as they are demanding new restrictions on President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown and threatening a shutdown of the Homeland Security Department.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement late Monday that a White House counterproposal to the list of demands they transmitted over the weekend “included neither details nor legislative text” and does not address “the concerns Americans have about ICE’s lawless conduct.” The White House proposal was not released publicly.\n\nThe Democrats’ statement comes as time is running short, with another partial government shutdown threatening to begin Saturday. Among the Democrats’ demands are a requirement for judicial warrants, better identification of DHS officers, new use-of-force standards and a stop to racial profiling. They say such changes are necessary after two protesters were fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis last month.\n\nEarlier Monday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., had expressed optimism about the rare negotiations between Democrats and the White House, saying there was “forward progress.”\n\nThune said it was a good sign that the two sides were trading papers, and “hopefully they can find some common ground here.”\n\nBut coming to an agreement on the charged issue of immigration enforcement will be difficult, especially as rank-and-file lawmakers in both parties were skeptical about finding common ground.\n\nRepublicans have balked at the Democrats’ requests and some have demands of their own, including the addition of legislation that would require proof of citizenship before Americans register to vote and restrictions on cities that they say do not do enough to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nAnd many Democrats who are furious about Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s aggressive crackdown have said they won’t vote for another penny of Homeland Security funding until enforcement is radically scaled back.\n\n“Dramatic changes are needed at the Department of Homeland Security before a DHS funding bill moves forward,” Jeffries said earlier Monday. “Period. Full stop.”\n\nCongress is trying to renegotiate the DHS spending bill after Trump agreed to a Democratic request that it be separated out from a larger spending measure that became law last week. That package extended Homeland Security funding at current levels only through Feb. 13, creating a brief window for action as the two parties discuss new restrictions on ICE and other federal officers.\n\nDemocrats made the demands for new restrictions on ICE and other federal law enforcement after ICU nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol officer in Minneapolis on Jan. 24, and some Republicans suggested that new restrictions were necessary. Renee Good was shot by ICE agents on Jan. 7.\n\nWhile he agreed to separate the funding, Trump has not publicly responded to the Democrats’ specific demands.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said late last week that the Trump administration is willing to discuss some items on the Democrats’ list, but “others don’t seem like they are grounded in any common sense, and they are nonstarters for this administration.”\n\nSchumer and Jeffries have said they want immigration officers to remove their masks, to show identification and to better coordinate with local authorities. They have also demanded a stricter use-of-force policy for the federal officers, legal safeguards at detention centers and a prohibition on tracking protesters with body-worn cameras.\n\nAmong other demands, Democrats say Congress should end indiscriminate arrests, “improve warrant procedures and standards,” ensure the law is clear that officers cannot enter private property without a judicial warrant and require that before a person can be detained, it’s verified that the person is not a U.S. citizen.\n\nRepublicans have said they support the requirement for DHS officers to have body-worn cameras — language that was in the original DHS bill — but have balked at many of the other Democratic asks.\n\n“Taking the masks off ICE officers and agents, the reason we can’t do that is that it would subject them to great harm, their families at great risk because people are doxing them and targeting them,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Monday. “We’ve got to talk about things that are reasonable and achievable.”\n\nTennessee Sen. Bill Hagerty said on “Fox News Sunday” that Democrats are ”trying to motivate a radical left base.”\n\n“The left has gone completely overboard, and they’re threatening the safety and security of our agents so they cannot do their job,” Hagerty said.\n\nIn addition to ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the homeland security bill includes funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Transportation Security Administration. If DHS shuts down, Thune said last week, “there’s a very good chance we could see more travel problems” similar to the 43-day government closure last year.\n\nLawmakers in both parties have suggested they could separate out funding for ICE and Border Patrol and pass the rest of it by Friday. But Thune has been cool to that idea, saying instead that Congress should pass another short-term extension for all of DHS while they negotiate the possible new restrictions.\n\n“If there’s additional time that’s needed, then hopefully Democrats would be amenable to another extension,” Thune said.\n\nMany Democrats are unlikely to vote for another extension. But Republicans could potentially win enough votes in both chambers from Democrats if they feel hopeful about negotiations.\n\n“The ball is in the Republicans’ court,” Jeffries said Monday.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — A federal judge on Monday blocked a California law from going into effect that would ban federal immigration agents from covering their faces, but they will still be required to wear clear identification showing their agency and badge number.\n\nCalifornia became the first state to ban most law enforcement officers from wearing facial coverings under a bill that was signed in September following the summer of high-profile raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Trump administration filed a lawsuit in November challenging the laws, arguing that they would threaten the safety of officers who are facing harassment, doxing, and violence and that they violated the constitution because the state is directly regulating the federal government.\n\nJudge Christina Snyder said she issued the initial ruling because the mask ban as it was enacted did not also apply to state law enforcement authorities, discriminating against the federal government. The ruling could have national implications as states grapple with how to deal with federal agents enforcing the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.\n\nIt left open the possibility to future legislation banning federal agents from wearing masks if it applied to all law enforcement agencies, with Snyder writing \"the Court finds that federal officers can perform their federal functions without wearing masks.” The ruling will go into effect Feb. 19.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the bill in September banning some law enforcement officers from wearing masks, neck gaiters, and other facial coverings. It was slated to go into effect Jan. 1 but was put on hold due to the lawsuit.\n\nIn addition to exempting state law enforcement officers, it made exceptions for undercover agents, protective equipment like N95 respirators or tactical gear, and other situations where not wearing a mask would jeopardize an operation. Snyder sided with the federal government, which argued this exemption was discriminatory against federal agents.\n\nNewsom also signed into law a measure requiring law enforcement to wear clear identification showing their agency and badge number while on the job, which was challenged by the federal government but upheld by the judge.\n\nCalifornia State Sen. Scott Weiner, who proposed the original bill to ban facial coverings, said Monday he would immediately introduce new legislation to include state police in the law.\n\n“ICE and Border Patrol are covering their faces to maximize their terror campaign and to insulate themselves from accountability,” Weiner said in a news release. “We will ensure our mask ban can be enforced.”\n\nAt a Jan. 14 hearing, Snyder repeatedly asked the government’s lawyer, Tiberius Davis, to explain why banning masks would impede the federal law enforcement in carrying out their duties, if officers rarely wore masks prior to 2025.\n\nDavis cited claims by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that there has been a multifold increase in assaults and threats against federal officers. He also brought up an incident in Los Angeles where three women are being accused of livestreaming while following an ICE agent home and posting the address on Instagram.\n\n“There is real deterrence on the officer’s safety and ability to perform their duties,” Davis said.\n\nCameron Bell, California Department of Justice attorney, challenged his claims, saying there was no concrete evidence that federal agents can’t perform their duties without facial coverings.\n\nBell referenced declarations from U.S citizens who have been detained by federal agents but thought they were being kidnapped.\n\n“It’s obvious why these laws are in the public interest,” Bell said.\n\nThe federal government also argued in legal briefs that allowing California’s legislation could lead other states to be “emboldened to impose similar unconstitutional restraints.”\n\nDavis cited a statement from Newsom in July 2025 during an interview posted online where he discussed the mask ban bill, saying, “It appears that we don’t have the legal authority for federal agents but we do for other law enforcement authorities.”\n\nLos Angeles County supervisors voted in December to enact a local ordinance banning law enforcement from wearing masks that went into effect Jan. 8. However, the sheriff’s department said it would not enforce the ordinance until after the court ruled on the statewide mask ban. The Los Angeles Police Department had also said it wouldn’t enforce the mask ban.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Senada Greca, founder of WeRise and cofounder of Aonic. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAt least four times a week, I meet with Kim Kardashian for a personal training session. Today, we're focused on the upper body and core. Over our hour-and-a-half session, we'll do assisted pull-ups, hollow-body chest presses, face-pulls, and more. Kim likes to end most training sessions with a dead hang on the bar.\n\nI've been training Kim for three years now. I also help millions of other people (mostly women) through my training platform WeRise, and the fitness and nutrition videos I post on social media.\n\nStrength training is powerful, especially for women. Once you know the strength your body possesses, you'll understand how to feel good in your body, rather than feeling like you need to shrink or punish it. I know, because that's a change I've made myself.\n\nI'm the oldest of three girls, born in Albania. After the communist government was overthrown in the early 1990s, there was a lot of civil unrest. I remember the first time we heard gunshots. We hid under the bed, staying down for a long time.\n\nLuckily, my family won the green card lottery (Editor's note: The green card lottery is formally called the Diversity Visa Program, which provides up to 55,000 visas through random selection.), and we were able to immigrate to America in 1997 when I was 14. That helped set up a safer, more prosperous future for my sisters and me.\n\nAt the time, it was very challenging. I spoke with a heavy accent and dressed differently from my classmates in upstate New York, which led to a lot of bullying. Since I was the only one in the family who spoke English, I had to help my parents with legal documents, doctors' appointments, and getting my sisters into school. It was a lot.\n\nEverything in my life felt out of control. The one thing I could control was my eating, and not long after immigrating, I developed anorexia. Within a few years, I was also struggling with depression and anxiety. I was exercising, but only to punish my body.\n\nIn college, I connected with counseling and medication that helped me start getting healthy. The real turning point came when I was in my mid-20s and met a new primary care doctor. She was in her 50s, but running marathons every quarter. She taught me to think about exercise as a way to support mental health. I started running and became more physically and mentally stable.\n\nAbout 10 years ago, in my mid-30s, I started strength training. It changed my life, as I started using exercise to nourish myself.\n\nIn my immigrant family, financial security was always very important. I had a corporate job, and had never considered building something on my own — it just wasn't done.\n\nI started teaching yoga at night, and loved how my classes made people feel. In 2019, I began posting videos of my workouts, at first for myself. I was extremely consistent, which helped me grow a big following. When the pandemic happened, my following grew exponentially as people looked for workouts they could do at home.\n\nIn 2020, I launched my website and began charging for memberships. I quickly saw that my fitness business could be stable and successful. That gave me the courage to quit my corporate job to follow my passion. In the years since, my audience has only grown, and I've had amazing opportunities, like training Kim.\n\nToday, I'm in the best shape of my life — physically and mentally — at 43. I don't often talk about my age, because I feel ageless and don't want to define myself by a number. At the same time, I want to show that getting older doesn't have to mean winding down.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Alberto Castañeda Mondragón says his memory was so jumbled after a beating by immigration officers that he initially could not remember he had a daughter and still struggles to recall treasured moments like the night he taught her to dance.\n\nBut the violence he endured last month in Minnesota while being detained is seared into his battered brain.\n\nHe remembers Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents pulling him from a friend’s car on Jan. 8 outside a St. Paul shopping center and throwing him to the ground, handcuffing him, then punching him and striking his head with a steel baton. He remembers being dragged into an SUV and taken to a detention facility, where he said he was beaten again.\n\nHe also remembers the emergency room and the intense pain from eight skull fractures and five life-threatening brain hemorrhages.\n\n“They started beating me right away when they arrested me,” the Mexican immigrant recounted this week to The Associated Press, which recently reported on how his case contributed to mounting friction between federal immigration agents and a Minneapolis hospital.\n\nCastañeda Mondragón, 31, is one of an unknown number of immigration detainees who, despite avoiding deportation during the Trump administration's enforcement crackdown, have been left with lasting injuries following violent encounters with ICE officers. His case is one of the excessive-force claims the federal government has thus far declined to investigate.\n\nHe was hurt so badly he was disoriented for days at Hennepin County Medical Center, where ICE officers constantly watched over him.\n\nOfficers claimed he ran headfirst into a wall\n\nThe officers told nurses Castañeda Mondragón “purposefully ran headfirst into a brick wall,” an account his caregivers immediately doubted. A CT scan showed fractures to the front, back and both sides of his skull — injuries a doctor told AP were inconsistent with a fall.\n\n“There was never a wall,” Castañeda Mondragón said in Spanish, recalling ICE officers striking him with the same metal rod used to break the windows of the vehicle he was in. He later identified it as an ASP, a telescoping baton routinely carried by law enforcement.\n\nTraining materials and police use-of-force policies across the U.S. say such a baton can be used to hit the arms, legs and body. But striking the head, neck or spine is considered potentially deadly force.\n\n“The only time a person can be struck in the head with any baton is when the person presents the same threat that would permit the use of a firearm — a lethal threat to the officer or others,” said Joe Key, a former Baltimore police lieutenant and use-of-force expert who testifies in defense of police.\n\nOnce he was taken to an ICE holding facility at Ft. Snelling in suburban Minneapolis, Castañeda Mondragón said officers resumed beating him. Recognizing that he was seriously hurt, he said, he pleaded with them to stop but they just “laughed at me and hit me again.\"\n\n“They were very racist people,” he said. “No one insulted them, neither me nor the other person they detained me with. It was their character, their racism toward us, for being immigrants.”\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, did not respond to repeated requests for comment over the last two weeks on Castañeda Mondragón’s injuries.\n\nIt is unclear whether his arrest was captured on body-camera footage or if there might be additional recordings from security cameras at the detention center.\n\nIn a recent bid to boost transparency, DHS announced a broad rollout of body cameras for immigration officers in Minneapolis as the government also draws down ICE’s presence there.\n\nICE deportation officer William J. Robinson did not say how Castañeda Mondragón’s skull was smashed in a Jan. 20 declaration filed in federal court. During the intake process, it was determined he “had a head injury that required emergency medical treatment,” he wrote in the filing.\n\nThe declaration also stated that Castañeda Mondragón entered the U.S. legally in March 2022, and that the agency determined only after his arrest that he had overstayed his visa. A federal judge later ruled his arrest had been unlawful and ordered him released from ICE custody.\n\nVideo shows him stumbling during arrest\n\nA video posted to social media captured the moments immediately after Castañeda Mondragón’s arrest as four masked men walk him handcuffed through a parking lot. The video shows him unsteady and stumbling, held up by ICE officers.\n\n“Don’t resist,” shouts the woman who is recording. \"Cause they ain’t gonna do nothing but bang you up some more.”\n\n“Hope they don’t kill you,” she adds.\n\n“And y’all gave the man a concussion,” a male bystander shouts.\n\nThe witness who posted the video declined to speak with AP or provide consent for the video’s publication, but Castañeda Mondragón confirmed he is the handcuffed man seen in the recording.\n\nAt least one ICE officer later told staff at the medical center that Castañeda Mondragón “got his (expletive) rocked,” according to court documents filed by a lawyer seeking his release and nurses who spoke with AP.\n\nAP interviewed a doctor and five nurses about Castañeda Mondragón’s treatment at HCMC and the presence of ICE officers inside the hospital. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss patient care and feared retaliation. AP also consulted an outside physician, who affirmed the injuries were inconsistent with an accidental fall or running into a wall.\n\nMinnesota state law requires health professionals to report to law enforcement any wounds that could have been perpetrated as part of a crime.\n\nAn HCMC spokeswoman declined to say this week whether anyone at the facility had done so. However, following the Jan. 31 publication of AP’s initial story about Castañeda Mondragón’s arrest, hospital administrators opened an internal inquiry seeking to determine which staff members have spoken to the media, according to internal communications viewed by AP.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz posted a link to AP’s prior story about Castañeda Mondragón, but his office has not said whether state authorities would pursue answers.\n\n“Law enforcement cannot be lawless,” Walz wrote in the post on X. “Thousands of aggressive, untrained agents of the federal government continue to injure and terrorize Minnesotans. This must end.”\n\nCastañeda Mondragón’s arrest came a day after the first of two fatal shootings of U.S. citizens in Minneapolis by immigration officers, triggering widespread public protests.\n\nElected officials call for accountability\n\nMinnesota congressional leaders and other elected officials, including St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, called this week for an investigation of Castañeda Mondragón’s injuries.\n\nThe Ramsey County Attorney’s Office, which oversees St. Paul, urged Castañeda Mondragón to file a police report to prompt an investigation. He said he plans to file a complaint. A St. Paul police spokesperson said the department would investigate “all alleged crimes that are reported to us.”\n\nWhile the Trump administration insists ICE limits its operations to immigrants with violent rap sheets, Castañeda Mondragón has no criminal record.\n\n“We are seeing a repeated pattern of Trump Administration officials attempting to lie and gaslight the American people when it comes to the cruelty of this ICE operation in Minnesota,” Sen. Tina Smith, a Minnesota Democrat, said in a statement.\n\nRep. Kelly Morrison, another Democrat and a doctor, recently toured the Whipple Building, the ICE facility at Ft. Snelling. She said she saw severe overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and an almost complete lack of medical care.\n\n“If any one of our police officers did this, you know what just happened in Minnesota with George Floyd, we hold them accountable,” said Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum, whose district includes St. Paul.\n\nA native of Veracruz, Mexico, Castañeda Mondragón came to Minnesota nearly four years ago on a temporary work visa and found jobs as a driver and roofer. He uses his earnings to support his elderly father, who is disabled and diabetic, and his 10-year-old daughter.\n\nOn the day of his arrest, he was running errands with a friend when they suddenly found themselves surrounded by ICE agents. They began breaking the windows and opening the doors of the vehicle. He said the first person who hit him “got ugly with me for being Mexican” and not having documents showing his immigration status.\n\nAbout four hours after his arrest, court records show, Castañeda Mondragón was taken to an emergency room in the suburb of Edina with swelling and bruising around his right eye and bleeding. He was then transferred to the Minneapolis medical center, where he told staff he had been “dragged and mistreated by federal agents,” before his condition deteriorated, court records show.\n\nA week into his hospitalization, caregivers described him as minimally responsive. As his condition slowly improved, hospital staff handed him his cellphone, and he spoke with his child in Mexico, whom he could not remember.\n\n“I am your daughter,” she told him. “You left when I was 6 years old.”\n\nHis head injuries erased past experiences that for his daughter are unforgettable, including birthday parties and the day he left for the U.S. She’s been trying to revive his memory in daily calls.\n\n“When I turned 5, you taught me how to dance for the first time,” she reminded him recently.\n\n“All these moments, really, for me, have been forgotten,″ he said.\n\nHe showed gradual improvement and, to the surprise of some who treated him, was released from the hospital on Jan. 27.\n\nHe faces a long recovery and an uncertain future. Questions loom about whether he will be able to continue to support his family back in Mexico. “My family depends on me,” he said.\n\nThough his bruises have faded, the effects of his traumatic brain injuries linger. In addition to the problems with his memory, he also has issues with balance and coordination that could prove debilitating for a man whose work requires going up and down ladders. He said he is unable to bathe himself without help.\n\n“I can’t get on a roof now,” he said.\n\nCastañeda Mondragón, who does not have health insurance, said doctors have told him he needs ongoing care. Unable to earn a living, he is relying on support from co-workers and members of the Minneapolis-St. Paul community who are raising money to help provide food, housing and medical care. He has launched a GoFundMe.\n\nStill, he hopes to stay in the U.S. and to provide again someday for his loved ones. He differentiates between people in Minnesota, where he said he has felt welcome, and the federal officers who beat him.\n\n“It’s immense luck to have survived, to be able to be in this country again, to be able to heal, and to try to move forward,\" he said. “For me, it’s the best luck in the world.”\n\nBut when he closes his eyes at night, the fear that ICE officers will come for him dominates his dreams. He is now terrified to leave his apartment, he said.\n\n\"You’re left with the nightmare of going to work and being stopped,” Castañeda Mondragón said, “or that you’re buying your food somewhere, your lunch, and they show up and stop you again. They hit you.”\n\nBiesecker reported from Washington.

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Attorneys for the federal government have until next Thursday to reach an agreement with human rights lawyers who are seeking to ensure the right to counsel for people detained at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Minnesota, a judge said Friday.\n\nAdvocates said people held at the facility on the edge of Minneapolis who face possible deportation are denied adequate access to lawyers, including in-person meetings. Attorney Jeffrey Dubner said detainees are allowed to make phone calls, but ICE personnel are typically nearby.\n\nU.S. District Judge Nancy Brasel told Justice Department attorney Christina Parascandola that there seemed to be a “very wide factual disconnect” between what the human rights lawyers allege and the government’s claims of adequate access at what ICE depicts as only a temporary holding facility.\n\nParascandola said people detained at the facility have access to counsel and unmonitored phone calls at any time and for as long as they need. She conceded she had never been there.\n\nBrasel called her argument “a tough sell,” noting there was far more evidence in the case record to back up the plaintiffs’ claims than the government’s assurances.\n\n“The gap here is so enormous I don’t know how you're going to close it,\" the judge said.\n\nRather than ruling on the spot, Brasel told both sides to keep meeting with a retired judge who's mediating and who has helped narrow some of the gaps already. She noted at the start of the hearing that both sides agreed that “some degree of reasonable access” to legal counsel is constitutionally necessary but that they differed on the details of what that should look like.\n\nIf the sides don't reach at least a partial agreement by 5 p.m. Thursday, Feb. 12, the judge said she'll issue her order then. She didn't specify which way she'd rule.\n\nA member of Congress decries conditions at detention center\n\nThe facility is part of the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, which is a center of ICE operations and has been the scene of frequent protests.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Kelly Morrison, of Minnesota, said in a statement Friday that conditions at the detention center continue to be poor. The physician said she learned in her visit Thursday night that the facility has no protocols in place to prevent the spread of measles to Minnesota from Texas. At least two cases were reported at a major ICE detention center in Texas this week.\n\nSome Minnesota detainees including families with children have been sent to the Texas facility, and some have returned to Minnesota after courts intervened, including 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father.\n\n“It’s abundantly clear that Whipple is not at all equipped to handle what the Trump Administration is doing with their cruel and chaotic ‘Operation Metro Surge,’” Morrison said in a statement. “I am stunned by the inability or unwillingness of the federal agents to answer some of the most basic questions about their operations and protocols.”\n\nEven though a federal judge ruled Monday that members of Congress have the right to make unannounced visits to ICE facilities, Morrison said in a statement that agents attempted to deny her entry for nearly a half-hour and demanded that she leave before eventually letting her in.\n\nOn her first attempt last month, Morrison and fellow Minnesota Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar and Angie Craig were turned away.\n\nAfter she was able to enter the facility last weekend, Morrison said no real medical care was being offered to people held there.\n\nCraig and Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum said they were turned away despite the court order when they tried to visit the facility overnight.\n\n“We have heard countless reports that detainees are being held in unlivable conditions at Whipple,” the two representatives said in a statement. “We have every reason to believe that this administration is once again lying through their teeth and trying to hide what we all know to be true -- that they are ignoring due process and treating immigrants as political pawns, not people.”\n\nMan charged with fel ony for wrecking anti-ICE sculpture\n\nA supporter of the immigration crackdown who posted a video on social media of himself kicking down an anti-ICE sculpture outside the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul was released from jail Friday after being charged with a felony count of damage to property.\n\nLt. Mike Lee, a spokesperson for the Minnesota State Patrol, said Capitol Security observed Jake Lang, 30, of Lake Worth, Florida, damaging the display Thursday afternoon. He was arrested a short distance away. The ice sculpture spelled out “Prosecute ICE.”\n\nAt his first court appearance, Lang was released pending trial but ordered to stay at least three blocks away from the Capitol. Court records don't list an attorney who could comment on his behalf.\n\nLang was drowned out by a large crowd last month when he attempted to hold a small rally in Minneapolis in support of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Lang was previously charged with assaulting an officer and other crimes before receiving clemency as part of President Donald Trump’s sweeping intervention on behalf of Jan. 6 defendants last year.",

    "description": "Immigration agents have taken to venting about their frustrations online as they have been placed at the center of the Trump administration’s crackdown",
    "fullText": "Thousands of federal immigration agents have been complaining about their jobs in an online forum, where they blasted “incompetent leadership,” according to a report.\n\nAgents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agencies, part of the Department of Homeland Security, have taken to venting about their frustrations online as they have been placed at the center of the Trump administration’s crackdown.\n\nThere are over 5,000 users on the unnamed forum seen by WIRED claiming to be current and former federal immigration agents. There, they complained of the negative public perception of the agencies, long working hours and “incompetent” leadership, according to the outlet.\n\nThe outlet noted that users on the forum do not need to prove their employment to join and it had not confirmed the identities of the people posting.\n\nUsers were candid about the public perception of the agencies amid the Trump administration’s immigration surge in cities across the U.S.\n\n“I'm all for removing illegals, but snatching dudes off lawn mowers in Cali and leaving the truck and equipment just sitting there? Definitely not working smarter,” said one user in a post viewed by WIRED.\n\nPosts in the forum reportedly amped up following public scrutiny and outrage of the agencies in Minnesota, where U.S. citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti were killed at the hands of federal immigration agents in Minneapolis last month.\n\nOne user started a thread titled, “Ready to resign, had enough stress” five days before Pretti was killed. “I have 2.3 years left for full special category retirement … but don't know if I'll make it. Tired of this Agency. Employees being abused badly,” the user reportedly wrote.\n\nThe user also complained of agents being deployed for temporary duty at short notice in cities where the administration is carrying out large-scale immigration operations.\n\n“No more weekends off, more work than ever before in 18 years. No more union. No more down time,” the post reportedly continued. “This is not what any of us envisioned for our last years of career when we are in our 50's.”\n\nOther users lashed out at Homeland Security leadership.\n\n“Led by some of the worst leadership I’ve ever witnessed, from the local level all the way up to the national stage, this agency has managed to turn a righteous mission into a complete clown show,” another user reportedly wrote.\n\n“This is going to be a train wreck that we may not survive,” another reportedly said.\n\nThe Independent had contacted the Department of Homeland Security for comment.\n\nReports of “plummeting” morale among federal law enforcement officers tasked with carrying out the administration’s immigration operations have been widespread since the unrest in Minneapolis. In a report at the end of January, more than 20 current and former immigration officials told The New York Times of their discontent in the hours following the fatal shooting of Pretti.\n\nCurrent and former ICE officials who spoke with the outlet anonymously said they were “unhappy with the sharp rhetoric” coming from top White House and Homeland Security officials, who were quick to blame Pretti.\n\nOne ICE agent told the Times that he had “always given the benefit of the doubt to the government in these situations,” but that he now no longer believed “any of the statements they put out anymore.”\n\n“We lost all trust,” a current ICE official added. “I’m not sure I can see how we exist three years from now.”\n\nFox News correspondent Bill Melugin also reported “extreme frustration” in the department over “some of the claims & narratives DHS pushed in the aftermath of the shooting.”\n\n“These sources say this messaging from DHS officials has been catastrophic from a PR and morale perspective, as it is eroding trust and credibility,” Melugin reported Sunday.\n\nIn response, Tricia McLaughlin, Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary, said ICE and border patrol agents “get up every morning to try and make our communities safer.”\n\n“The men and women of ICE and Border Patrol are fathers and mothers, sons and daughters,” McLaughlin said in a previous statement to The Independent. “Like everyone else, our officers just want to go home to our families at night. The violence and dehumanization of these men and women who are simply enforcing the law must stop.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Thursday that demands made by Democrats for new restrictions on federal immigration officers are “unrealistic” and warned that the Department of Homeland Security will shut down next week if they do not work with Republicans and the White House.\n\nDemocrats say they will not vote for a DHS spending bill when funding runs out unless there are “dramatic changes” at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal law enforcement agencies in the wake of the fatal shootings of two protesters in Minneapolis last month.\n\nThe Democratic leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, released an expanded list of 10 detailed proposals on Wednesday night for restraining President Donald Trump’s aggressive campaign of immigration enforcement. Among the demands are a requirement for judicial warrants, better identification of DHS officers, new use of force standards and a stop to racial profiling.\n\nCongress is trying to renegotiate the DHS spending bill after Trump last week agreed to a Democratic request that it be separated from a larger spending measure and extended at current levels for two weeks while the two parties negotiate. The deal came after ICU nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol officer in Minneapolis on Jan. 24, and some Republicans agreed that new restrictions were necessary.\n\nBut with nearly a week gone, a shutdown is becoming increasingly likely starting Feb. 14 as Republicans have been cool to most of the Democrats’ requests.\n\n“This is not a blank check situation where Republicans just do agree to a list of Democrat demands,” said Thune, R-S.D. “The only way to get reforms to ICE is to agree to a bill.”\n\nAs of now, Thune said, “we aren’t anywhere close to having any sort of an agreement.”\n\nIn addition to ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the homeland security bill includes funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Transportation Security Administration. If DHS shuts down, Thune said, “there’s a very good chance we could see more travel problems” similar to the 43-day government closure last year.\n\nSchumer, D-N.Y., said he is “astounded to hear” Republicans say his party’s proposals were political or unworkable.\n\n“It’s about people’s basic rights, it’s about people’s safety,” Schumer said. If Republicans do not like the ideas, he said, “they need to explain why.”\n\nSchumer and Jeffries, D-N.Y., have made several demands, including no masks for officers, judicial warrants and better federal coordination with local authorities. The list they released Wednesday added several new items, including a stricter use-of-force policy, legal safeguards at detention centers and a prohibition on tracking protesters with body-worn cameras.\n\nDemocrats say Congress should end indiscriminate arrests, “improve warrant procedures and standards,” ensure the law is clear that officers cannot enter private property without a judicial warrant and require that before a person can be detained, it's verified that the person is not a U.S. citizen.\n\nThey also want an end to racial profiling, saying DHS officers should be prohibited from stopping, questioning or searching people \"based on an individual’s presence at certain locations, their job, their spoken language and accent or their race and ethnicity.”\n\nFor officers conducting immigration enforcement, Democrats say that in addition to officers taking off their masks and showing identification, DHS should regulate and standardize uniforms and equipment to bring them in line with other law enforcement agencies.\n\nSchumer called it a “gut check moment for Congress\" as the immigration enforcement operations have rocked Minneapolis and other U.S. cities. But Republicans were dismissive.\n\nWyoming's John Barrasso, the No. 2 Republican senator, said the demands are “radical and extreme” and a “far-left wish list.”\n\nSen. Katie Britt, who is helping lead negotiations, said the list is “a ridiculous Christmas list of demands\" and warned that time is running out before the deadline.\n\n“I encourage them to talk to the White House,” she said. “We only have one week left.”\n\nThune has also encouraged Democrats and the White House to talk. It is unclear whether they are or whether Democrats would be willing to back down on any of their demands.\n\nSome Republicans have demands of their own, including adding legislation that would require proof of citizenship before Americans register to vote and restrictions on cities that they say do not do enough to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said it is up to Republicans to ensure the government doesn't shut down because they are in charge.\n\n“The American people want this abuse to stop,” Murphy said.\n\nSome look to limit shutdown pain\n\nOther lawmakers are searching for options to prevent another partial shutdown.\n\nOne idea being floated is to essentially fund some of the other agencies within DHS -– the Coast Guard, airport operations under TSA and disaster assistance from FEMA.\n\n“Why not take that off the table?” said Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, whose state is in need of FEMA funds from recent disasters.\n\n“If it doesn’t look like they can get it done,” he said about the immigration enforcement overhaul. “I really think they should look at a la carte funding of agencies.”\n\nSome Democrats have said they agree, but Thune said Thursday that splitting apart the DHS appropriations bill to single out ICE would “defund law enforcement.”\n\nSplitting the bill would mean essentially cutting ICE loose by allowing it to go without its routine federal funding because the agency already has such a robust budget from Trump’s tax and spending cut bill from last year.\n\nICE is expected to receive about $10 billion in the annual appropriations bill, a fraction of the $175 billion-plus for homeland security for the administration’s mass deportation agenda.",

    "fullText": "A routine fuel stop turned into a national political flashpoint after a gas station employee refused service to federal immigration agents, igniting a debate that now reaches far beyond politics and squarely into the automotive and fuel retail space.\n\nThe incident unfolded at a Speedway gas station in Minneapolis when Border Patrol agents attempted to refuel government vehicles during official operations.\n\nAccording to video footage that quickly spread online, a man identifying himself as the store’s manager denied service and stated bluntly that he did not support ICE, adding that no one at the store did either. The agents were told to leave without being allowed to purchase fuel.\n\nWithin hours, the encounter became a lightning rod. Critics accused the business of politicizing a basic commercial service, while supporters framed the refusal as a form of protest.\n\nBut for the automotive and fuel industries, the episode raises deeper questions about neutrality, safety, and the evolving role of gas stations in an increasingly polarized environment.\n\nFuel stations occupy a unique position in American infrastructure for the simple fact that they aren’t simply retail outlets. They are essential service points relied upon by private motorists, commercial fleets, emergency responders, and, yes, government agencies like ICE.\n\nDenying fuel is not equivalent to refusing a cup of coffee or retail merchandise. Vehicles without fuel do not operate, and in the case of law enforcement or emergency services, that reality carries serious implications.\n\nIndustry experts note that while private businesses generally retain the right to refuse service, gas stations historically operate under an expectation of political neutrality. Fleet contracts, fuel cards, and government supply agreements are built on reliability, not ideology.\n\nOnce a station is perceived as selectively serving customers based on political or occupational identity, that reliability comes into question.\n\nThe fallout for Speedway and its parent companies has been swift. Calls for boycotts surfaced almost immediately, with critics warning that the brand risks alienating everyday drivers who view fuel access as nonpartisan.\n\nOthers warned of reputational damage that could ripple across franchise networks, where individual store decisions can reflect on national brands regardless of corporate policy.\n\nThere is also a safety dimension that automotive analysts are watching closely. Federal agents often refuel during active operations or long-distance deployments. Forcing vehicles to reroute in search of fuel introduces delays and unpredictability.",

    "description": "It doesn’t happen often, but local law enforcement can arrest and charge federal agents. Legal experts say there’s a moral obligation to at least try to hold federal immigration officers accountable when they violate the Constitution and the law.",
    "fullText": "Minutes after a federal agent shot and killed a Mexican immigrant in a Chicago suburb last September, a group of police officers stood on the sidewalk trying to figure out the answer to a question of protocol: Who would investigate the shooting?\n\n“Wouldn’t it be state’s, at a minimum?” one Franklin Park officer asked, according to body camera footage.\n\nChief Mike Witz shook his head. “No, because it’s a federal shooting,” he said. “You’re not going to investigate a federal officer.”\n\nHis officers didn’t investigate. In their report, they didn’t even note the names of the two Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at the scene of Silverio Villegas González’s death. Instead, they deferred to the FBI.\n\nLocal law enforcement officials also did not investigate when a Border Patrol agent shot and wounded a U.S. citizen in her car in Chicago less than a month later. Or when an ICE agent in Phoenix shot a Honduran man during a traffic stop later that month.\n\nIn fact, local police did not open investigations into six of the 12 shootings by on-duty federal agents that have led to the deaths or injuries of citizens and immigrants since September, a ProPublica analysis found. In three other shooting cases, state or local police said they have opened inquiries, which they called a routine practice in those jurisdictions. And in Minnesota, where ICE and Border Patrol shot and killed two U.S. citizens and injured a Venezuelan man last month, state police have tried to conduct independent investigations only to be thwarted by the Trump administration, which has gone so far as to block officers from a scene, even when they had a judicial warrant.\n\nIn almost every instance, President Donald Trump’s administration blamed the injured and dead for the shooting within hours of the incident, raising questions about whether federal officials can fairly and objectively investigate their own. Legal experts and advocates for immigrants say this apparent lack of accountability demands that local authorities step up and exercise their power to investigate and prosecute federal agents who break state laws — from battery to murder.\n\n“Local police and the state have gotten a free pass,” said Craig Futterman, a law professor at the University of Chicago and the co-founder and director of its Civil Rights and Police Accountability Project. “Residents have every right and should be demanding that, ‘Hey, state authorities, police, local police: Protect us. Arrest people who kill us, who batter us, who point guns at us and threaten and assault us without legal cause to do so.’”\n\nIt’s usually the opposite scenario: federal authorities coming in to investigate a troubled police department. But local authorities have investigated and charged federal agents in the past. It’s just rare and complicated. The federal supremacy clause in the U.S. Constitution bars local interference with federal law enforcement officers when they act reasonably and within the scope of their duties.\n\nBut given the aggressive tactics employed by immigration agents under the Trump administration, Futterman and other legal experts said local police and prosecutors are morally obligated to at least try to hold federal law enforcement officers accountable.\n\n“We’re in an environment right now where ICE officers are blatantly and egregiously violating the Constitution and the law,” said Joanna Schwartz, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. “The federal government has made it very clear that they are not going to do anything to provide any sort of accountability backstop to its officers. Unfortunately, because Congress is not taking any steps to rein ICE officers in, there really is no option other than states protecting their constituents’ rights.”\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said that agents are “trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and our officers.” All use-of-force incidents are properly reported and reviewed by an appropriate law enforcement agency, the spokesperson said.\n\nImmigration agents at the border have long been criticized for use of deadly force and lack of rigorous investigations afterward. But now the same militarized force is on display in major American cities far from the border, where residents are not used to their presence.\n\nThe shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis last month — and the federal government’s resistance to a routine local investigation — has prompted Democratic and some Republican officials across the country to call for more accountability. Last week, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order directing police officers to document alleged illegal activity by federal immigration agents and refer any evidence of felonies to prosecutors.\n\nCalifornia’s governor and attorney general issued a reminder to local police of their rights to investigate federal agents. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes launched a website asking residents to submit evidence of federal agents’ misconduct. And prosecutors from nine jurisdictions around the country announced a new coalition to provide mutual support to law enforcement authorities bringing charges against federal officers.\n\nIn Minneapolis, prosecutors say they’re working with state police to investigate in spite of resistance from federal officials. So far, DHS officials have refused to provide evidence or even the names of the agents involved in the January shootings. Prosecutors went so far as to obtain an emergency order to require that federal agencies preserve evidence in the Pretti case. A judge dropped the temporary restraining order on Monday, following assurances from the federal government that it would maintain investigative materials.\n\nThe prosecutors said they believe they can still gather enough evidence to make an informed decision about whether to charge the federal agents.\n\n“We get cases submitted to us every day that don’t have all the evidence we would like,” Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said in an interview. “We would certainly like the gun. We would like the shell casings, that kind of thing. But it’s also not a mystery as to why these people died.”\n\nEven after getting a judicial warrant, investigators from the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension were turned away by federal agents from the Minneapolis intersection where Pretti, 37, was shot and killed. Federal officials also excluded the BCA from the investigation into the death of Renee Good, who was shot and killed in her car two weeks before Pretti.\n\nBCA Superintendent Drew Evans said he’d never seen his officers physically stopped from doing their job by another law enforcement agency. Across the country, he said, state agencies like the BCA routinely investigate deadly force incidents like this one.\n\n“We’re in uncharted territory here,” he said.\n\nWithin hours of each killing, Trump officials publicly labeled the dead “domestic terrorists.” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti was “brandishing” a gun when he approached the officers, while the Border Patrol’s Gregory Bovino claimed Pretti was planning a “massacre.”\n\nVideo footage contradicted the administration’s version of events. Pretti, for instance, never unholstered his gun, which he was legally allowed to carry.\n\nEarly last week, Trump sent Bovino and Border Patrol agents away from Minneapolis, and on Wednesday DHS officials said they would pull another 700 agents out of the state — signs  the administration may be changing its approach in response to rising criticism. The FBI is now investigating the Pretti shooting, and the Justice Department announced Friday that it had opened a civil rights investigation.\n\nA DOJ spokesperson did not answer questions for this story but referred reporters to a press conference last weekend in which Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche said DHS is following its normal investigative protocols in the Pretti shooting.\n\nMeanwhile, the Justice Department has said it has no plans to investigate Good’s shooting.\n\n“We don’t just go out and investigate every time an officer is forced to defend himself against somebody putting his life in danger,” Blanche told Fox News.\n\nPolice in Franklin Park and Chicago have not explained why they didn’t open their own investigations into the two shootings last fall. In the Franklin Park case, the decision to let the FBI alone investigate the killing of Villegas was made within minutes of the shooting, according to dispatch records.\n\nVillegas, a 38-year-old restaurant cook, was shot as he tried to drive away from ICE agents who had pulled him over. As in Minneapolis, the Trump administration’s narrative of what happened did not match the evidence. DHS claimed that Villegas dragged one of the agents, causing serious injuries. The agent fired “because he feared for his life,” officials said. Police body camera footage released after the shooting showed the agent downplaying his injury as “nothing major.”\n\nAt the scene, Franklin Park police officers directed traffic and interviewed a witness, the footage shows. At one point, one officer told his colleague that the police department was “just securing until they get here,” referring to the FBI.\n\nWitz, who was then the police chief but has since retired, could not be reached for comment; the current chief did not respond to interview requests.\n\nA similar situation unfolded in Chicago on Oct. 4 after a Border Patrol agent fired into the vehicle of a woman who federal officials claimed “ambushed” them. Marimar Martinez was charged with assaulting federal agents, though the charges were later dropped.\n\nAt the time, the Chicago Police Department said officers had responded to a call about a shooting “to document the incident” and to “maintain safety and traffic control.” When asked last week why it didn’t open an independent inquiry, the department directed ProPublica to its October statement, which made clear the police were “not involved in the incident or its investigation” and directed questions to federal authorities.\n\nAs the events in Minneapolis continued to generate criticism nationwide, Chicago’s mayor unveiled his executive order that directed officers to investigate federal immigration agents who break the law and to refer them for criminal prosecution. In a statement, the mayor’s office said the initiative was a response to “the absence of legal repercussions in the wake of the shooting of Marimar Martinez in Chicago and the killings of Silverio Villegas González in Franklin Park and Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.”\n\nLegal experts said they were not aware of recent examples of Illinois law enforcement agencies investigating an on-duty federal agent, though last month a suburban police department obtained misdemeanor charges against an off-duty ICE agent accused of attacking an activist who was filming him while the agent was pumping gas.\n\nIllinois State Police officials said they would investigate federal agents who were accused of breaking the law if they are asked to do so.\n\nMeanwhile, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker called on a state accountability commission to examine the roles of key Trump officials in the escalation of aggressive tactics during a monthslong immigration enforcement campaign in Chicago and its suburbs late last year. Pritzker had previously established the commission to​ gather videos and testimonies about federal agents’ conduct, and to create a public record of what happened. The commission lacks subpoena power but can refer information about potential violations of state law to law enforcement agencies or prosecutors.\n\n“Just imagine if the agents who shot Mr. Villegas González back on Sept. 12 had been publicly disciplined,” Rubén Castillo, a retired federal judge who chairs the commission, said at a hearing Friday. “Maybe, just maybe, the Minnesota shootings would not have occurred, and two people would be alive who are now dead.”\n\nHe added: “We will have conversations with those in local law enforcement to suggest prosecutions that should be occurring even as we speak.”\n\nIn California, neither the Los Angeles nor Ontario police departments investigated after two men were shot by federal immigration agents in separate October incidents and then accused of assaulting federal officers — despite video evidence and victim statements that conflicted with the accounts officials provided. A federal judge dismissed the case against one man, a Mexican immigrant and popular TikTokker; the other, a U.S. citizen, pleaded not guilty and has a trial scheduled for April.\n\nPolice in Phoenix also said they are not investigating the shooting of a man who federal officials say fled immigration agents last October, leaving the case to the FBI and ICE. And local police in Portland, Oregon, are not investigating an incident where federal agents shot at a Venezuelan man who had allegedly hit an unoccupied Border Patrol vehicle with his car in early January, injuring him and his passenger. The man was later charged with assaulting an officer. Unlike in some of the other cases, the Oregon attorney general’s office has opened its own investigation.\n\nIn contrast, police in Pima County, Arizona, and Anne Arundel County, Maryland, and the Texas Rangers have all said they opened investigations into recent shootings involving federal immigration officers.\n\nAsking local officials to investigate their federal counterparts does not come without challenges. Police officers and prosecutors are wary of being seen as interfering with federal law enforcement operations. They may be reluctant to damage their already complicated relationships with agencies with whom they sometimes partner.\n\nThen there’s the worry about the political consequences, including the threat of losing federal funding, a dynamic that’s particularly acute under the Trump administration.\n\n“This particular federal government has lobbed all kinds of threats and acted on threats against local authorities and state authorities for failure to cooperate or not do what they want them to do,” said Futterman, the University of Chicago law professor. “It’s a reason in itself not to bite a hand that feeds you.”\n\nEven when local officials open their own investigations into federal agents, there’s no guarantee they can bring the cases to court. Federal agents can claim immunity in response to state charges, legal experts said, and can move their cases to federal court.\n\nThat immunity stems from a Supreme Court ruling more than a century ago. During the Civil Rights Movement, that immunity was used when the federal government wanted to protect its law enforcement officers tasked with enforcing then-controversial efforts like desegregation in hostile states.\n\nNow local officials face the opposite challenge: protecting their constituents’ constitutional rights from what they believe is excessive force at the hands of federal officers.\n\nSteve Descano, the commonwealth’s attorney for Fairfax County, Virginia, would be the first to admit that nothing about prosecuting federal agents is easy. During the first Trump administration, Descano brought state manslaughter charges against two U.S. Park Police officers who shot and killed a Virginia man. A federal judge dismissed the case in 2021 and said the officers were entitled to immunity because their actions were necessary and proper.\n\nStill, Descano, who is part of the coalition of prosecutors aiming to hold federal law enforcement accountable, said he believed he and others have a responsibility to do so.\n\n“If they are not willing to take these actions,” he said, “then they are cowards and they are not worthy of their positions.”",

    "fullText": "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — U.S. immigration agents in Oregon must stop arresting people without warrants unless there's a likelihood of escape, a federal judge ruled Wednesday.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mustafa Kasubhai issued a preliminary injunction in a proposed class-action lawsuit targeting the Department of Homeland Security's practice of arresting immigrants they happen to come across while conducting ramped-up enforcement operations — which critics have described as “arrest first, justify later.”\n\nThe department, which is named as a defendant in the suit, did not immediately comment in response to a request from The Associated Press.\n\nSimilar actions, including immigration agents entering private property without a warrant issued by a court, have drawn concern from civil rights groups across the country amid President Donald Trump's mass deportation efforts.\n\nCourts in Colorado and Washington, D.C., have issued rulings like Kasubhai’s, and the government has appealed them.\n\nIn a memo last week, Todd Lyons, the acting head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, emphasized that agents should not make an arrest without an administrative arrest warrant issued by a supervisor unless they develop probable cause to believe that the person is in the U.S. illegally and likely to escape from the scene before a warrant can be obtained.\n\nBut the judge heard evidence that agents in Oregon have arrested people in immigration sweeps without such warrants or determining escape was likely.\n\nThe daylong hearing included testimony from one plaintiff, Victor Cruz Gamez, a 56-year-old grandfather who has been in the U.S. since 1999. He told the court he was arrested and held in an immigration detention facility for three weeks even though he has a valid work permit and a pending visa application.\n\nCruz Gamez testified that he was driving home from work in October when he was pulled over by immigration agents. Despite showing his driver's license and work permit, he was detained and taken to the ICE building in Portland before being sent to an immigration detention center in Tacoma, Washington. After three weeks there, he was set to be deported until a lawyer secured his release, he said.\n\nHe teared up as he recounted how the arrest impacted his family, especially his wife. Once he was home they did not open the door for three weeks out of fear and one of his grandchildren did not want to go to school, he said through a Spanish interpreter.\n\nAfterward a lawyer for the federal government told Cruz Gamez he was sorry about what he went through and the effect it had on them.\n\nKasubhai said the actions of agents in Oregon — including drawing guns on people while detaining them for civil immigration violations — have been “violent and brutal,” and he was concerned about the administration denying due process to those swept up in immigration raids.\n\n“Due process calls for those who have great power to exercise great restraint,” he said. “That is the bedrock of a democratic republic founded on this great constitution. I think we’re losing that.”\n\nThe lawsuit was brought by the nonprofit law firm Innovation Law Lab, whose executive director, Stephen Manning, said he was confident the case will be a “catalyst for change here in Oregon.”\n\n“That is fundamentally what this case is about: asking the government to follow the law,” he said during the hearing.\n\nThe preliminary injunction will remain in effect while the lawsuit proceeds.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A government lawyer who told a judge that her job “sucks” during a court hearing stemming from the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota has been removed from her Justice Department post, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nJulie Le had been working for the Justice Department on a detail, but the U.S. attorney in Minnesota ended her assignment after her comments in court on Tuesday, the person said. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel matter. She had been working for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement before the temporary assignment.\n\nAt a hearing Tuesday in St. Paul, Minnesota, for several immigration cases, Le told U.S. District Judge Jerry Blackwell that she wishes he could hold her in contempt of court “so that I can have a full 24 hours of sleep.”\n\n“What do you want me to do? The system sucks. This job sucks. And I am trying every breath that I have so that I can get you what you need,” Le said, according to a transcript.\n\nLe's extraordinary remarks reflect the intense strain that has been placed on the federal court system since President Donald Trump returned to the White House a year ago with a promise to carry out mass deportations. ICE officials have said the surge in Minnesota has become its largest-ever immigration operation since ramping up in early January.\n\nSeveral prosecutors have left the U.S. Attorney’s office in Minnesota amid frustration with the immigration enforcement surge and the Justice Department’s response to fatal shootings of two civilians by federal agents. Le was assigned at least 88 cases in less than a month, according to online court records.\n\nBlackwell told Le that the volume of cases isn't an excuse for disregarding court orders. He expressed concern that people arrested in immigration enforcement operations are routinely jailed for days after judges have ordered their release from custody.\n\n“And I hear the concerns about all the energy that this is causing the DOJ to expend, but, with respect, some of it is of your own making by not complying with orders,” the judge told Le.\n\nLe said she was working for the Department of Homeland Security as an ICE attorney in immigration court before she “stupidly” volunteered to work the detail in Minnesota. Le told the judge that she wasn't properly trained for the assignment. She said she wanted to resign from the job but couldn't get a replacement.\n\n\"Fixing a system, a broken system, I don’t have a magic button to do it. I don’t have the power or the voice to do it,\" she said.\n\nHomeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Le was a probationary attorney.\n\n“This conduct is unprofessional and unbecoming of an ICE attorney in abandoning her obligation to act with commitment, dedication, and zeal to the interests of the United States Government,” McLaughlin said in a statement.\n\nLe and the U.S. Attorney's office in Minnesota didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nKira Kelley, an attorney who represented two petitioners at the hearing, said the flood of immigration petitions is necessary because “so many people being detained without any semblance of a lawful basis.”\n\n“And there’s no indication here that any new systems or bolded e-mails or any instructions to ICE are going to fix any of this,” she added.",

    "fullText": "In a congressional hearing on Tuesday, Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) read aloud text messages from an immigration agent who bragged about shooting a Chicago woman last year.\n\nOn Oct. 4, Customs and Border Protection agent Charles Exum shot Marimar Martinez five times in Brighton Park during the Department of Homeland Security’s Operation Midway Blitz, an immigration crackdown. DHS claimed Martinez had rammed Exum and other agents, which prompted them “to fire defensively.” The Department of Justice indicted Martinez, but ultimately the charges were dismissed after the government admitted in court that the ramming had not occurred.\n\nOn Tuesday, House Democrats held a hearing about the Trump administration’s ongoing crackdown in places such as Chicago and Minnesota. Martinez gave a harrowing account of the incident.\n\n“After being at the hospital for less than three hours, I was discharged from the hospital into custody of the FBI. As we left the hospital, I was escorted out through the back in a wheelchair. I observed over dozens of Border Patrol agents waiting outside the hospital,” Martinez said. “One of the agents came up to me with his cell phone and took a photograph of me. It was the same agent who had previously kept coming in and out [of my hospital] room, and I had to repeatedly tell him to leave.”\n\nLater in the hearing, Garcia read texts from Exum about the shooting. The messages were displayed on placards behind him:\n\nMs. Martinez, these are images of texts sent by the agent who shot you. And they’re actually disturbing to read, but I think it’s important for the public to see this. The agent linked an article about your shooting and texted, “Read it. 5 shots, 7 holes. I fired 7 rounds and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book, boys… Oh, well, it is what it is. Sh*t happens.”\n\nThis is someone that works for the United States government.\n\nThe hearing also featured testimony from Luke Granger and Brent Granger, the brothers of Renee Good, who was fatally shot by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross last month in Minneapolis. Two weeks after her killing, Border Patrol agent Jesus Ochoa and Customs and Border Protection officer Raymundo Gutierrez shot and killed Alex Pretti in the city.\n\nThe post Congressman Reads Texts From Border Agent Who Bragged About Shooting Chicago Woman: ‘5 Shots, 7 Holes’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "This story was produced by the Berks County bureau of Spotlight PA, an independent, nonpartisan newsroom. org/newsletters/gooddayberks.\n\nUPPER BERN — The Trump administration has quietly purchased a nearly 520,000-square-foot warehouse in Berks County as it plans to convert such facilities into immigration detention centers across the U.S.\n\nThe warehouse, located at 3501 Mountain Road in Upper Bern Township, was sold to the U.S. government on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for $87.4 million, deed records show. The purchase was recorded on Feb. 2.\n\nSpotlight PA visited the warehouse, which is located about a mile from I-78, on Jan. 15 and witnessed about two dozen individuals touring the exterior of the building. One man who arrived early to the site that day identified himself to a reporter as ICE.\n\nThe property was most recently called the Hamburg Logistics Center, and before that was the site of the Mountain Springs Arena, a county landmark known for rodeos and demolition derbies. It neighbors an Amazon warehouse and the Mountain Springs Camping Resort.\n\nThe building is one of at least 23 that ICE plans to convert into an immigration detention facility, Bloomberg reports. The Berks County warehouse could house up to 1,500 beds.\n\nICE also finalized the purchase of a warehouse in nearby Tremont Township, in Schuylkill County, on Monday, according to a deed. The Tremont property is located less than 300 yards from a daycare center and has already faced fierce resident opposition.\n\nA spokesperson for ICE did not answer any questions about the Berks County warehouse purchase and instead lauded the agency’s targeting of “vicious criminals.”\n\n“Thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill, ICE has new funding to expand detention space to keep these criminals off American streets before they are removed for good from our communities,” the spokesperson said.\n\nUpper Bern Township’s solicitor said in an emailed statement that community leaders learned about the sale on Monday. They declined to answer questions.\n\n“The township was not involved in this transfer and has not received any applications from either the prior or new owners regarding the future use of the property,” the statement reads. “The township has no further comment on this matter at this time.”\n\nState Sen. Chris Gebhard and Rep. Jamie Barton, Republicans who represent the area, said they have reached out to federal contacts to gather more information on how the Department of Homeland Security plans to use the warehouse.\n\n“Our immediate concerns include the potential loss of property tax revenue for the host municipality, county, and school district, as well as security and perimeter considerations,” the lawmakers said in a joint statement. “We look forward to engaging directly with the appropriate federal officials to address these issues. Once additional information is available, we will provide an update.”\n\nThe property is assessed at $22 million and currently pays $198,286 annually in county property taxes under the current tax rate of 9.013 mils. Combined with Hamburg Area School District and township taxes, the loss of tax revenue from the federal government’s purchase would be about $624,000.\n\nState Sen. Judy Schwank (D., Berks) declined to comment on the warehouse purchase on Monday. In an earlier interview with Spotlight PA, she called the then-potential sale “deeply concerning,” especially given the reports of mistreatment of people detained in ICE facilities. She released a statement about “ICE’s action in Minneapolis” on Jan. 27, shortly after federal agents killed Alex Pretti.\n\n“My concern is, knowing the track record of some of these other facilities located throughout the country, it’s not good,” she said. “I don’t necessarily want to see something like that being housed in our county.”\n\nThe deed finalized on Monday shows the property was sold to ICE by an LLC connected to PCCP, a national commercial real estate equity firm. The firm purchased the warehouse in 2024 for $57.5 million, deed records show.\n\nReached by phone Monday afternoon, PCCP partner Greg Eberhardt — who is the authorized signatory for 3501 Mountain Road Owner LLC on the latest deed — denied knowledge of the property and its sale, and refused to comment further.\n\n“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Eberhardt said before hanging up on a Spotlight PA reporter. “I’m not making company comments.”\n\nUpper Bern Township is situated on the edge of Berks and Schuylkill Counties, with a population of roughly 1,600 people. The community is mostly white, with only 2.8% of residents identifying as another race, according to the 2020 census.\n\nBridget Cambria, attorney with Aldea, a nonprofit that provides pro bono immigration legal services, said the detention center will have a “disruptive” and “chilling” impact on Berks County’s immigrant community.\n\n“If there are people that live freely and at peace knowing that they do the right thing, they can do their immigration process or stay with their family or figure out a way to legalize their status, they’re going to be more afraid to do that with a giant detention center in their backyard,” Cambria said.\n\nA 2022 study by the Detention Watch Center and the Immigrant Legal Resource Center found that immigrants were more likely to be arrested by ICE in counties with more detention bed-space.\n\nBEFORE YOU GO… If you learned something from this article, pay it forward and contribute to Spotlight PA at spotlightpa.org/donate.

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Immigration officers with guns drawn arrested activists who were trailing their vehicles on Tuesday in Minneapolis, while education leaders described anxiety and fear in Minnesota schools from the ongoing federal sweeps.\n\nBoth are signs that tension remains in the Minneapolis area after the departure of high-profile commander Greg Bovino of U.S. Border Patrol and the arrival of Trump administration border czar Tom Homan, which followed the fatal shooting of protester Alex Pretti.\n\n“There’s less smoke on the ground,” Gov. Tim Walz said, referring to tear gas and other irritants used by officers against protesters, “but I think it’s more chilling than it was last week because of the shift to the schools, the shift to the children.”\n\nAt least one person who had an anti-ICE message on clothing was handcuffed while face-down on the ground. An Associated Press photographer witnessed the arrests.\n\nICE agents are changing their tactics\n\nFederal agents in the Twin Cities lately have been conducting more targeted immigration arrests at homes and neighborhoods, rather than staging in parking lots. The convoys have been harder to find and less aggressive. Alerts in activist group chats have been more about sightings than immigration-related detainments.\n\nSeveral cars followed officers through south Minneapolis after there were reports of them knocking at homes. Officers stopped their vehicles and ordered activists to come out of a car at gunpoint. Agents told reporters at the scene to stay back and threatened to use pepper spray.\n\nHomeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said agents detained the activists because they hindered efforts to arrest a man who is in the country illegally.\n\nA federal judge last month put limits on how officers treat motorists who are following them but not obstructing their operations. Safely following agents “at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop,” the judge said. An appeals court, however, set the order aside.\n\nBovino, who was leading immigration enforcement in Minneapolis and other big U.S. cities, left town last week, shortly after Pretti's death became the second local killing of a U.S. citizen in January.\n\nHoman, who was dispatched to Minnesota to succeed Bovino, has warned that protesters could face consequences if they interfere with officers.\n\nOperation Metro Surge affecting schools\n\nWalz and education leaders held a news conference to say the presence of immigration officers is frightening some school communities. Brenda Lewis, superintendent of Fridley Public Schools in suburban Minneapolis, said she has been followed twice by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents since speaking publicly on Jan. 27 and that school board members have had ICE vehicles outside their homes.\n\nLewis, a U.S. citizen, said she has seen SUVs with tinted windows, multiple masked people inside and out-of-state license plates. She goes on neighborhood patrols near schools with a security guard.\n\n“Students are afraid to come to school, parents are afraid to drop them off,” Lewis said. “Staff are coming to work wondering if today will be the day something happens in one of our buildings.”\n\nShe said Fridley, which has Somali and Ecuadorian families, has added security, adjusted drop-off procedures and increased mental health support. Tracy Xiong, a social worker in the Columbia Heights district, said she has been coordinating grocery deliveries to school families and finding volunteers to drive children.\n\nThere was no immediate response to a request for comment from the Department of Homeland Security and ICE about the concerns of educators.\n\nGrand jury seeks communications, records\n\nMeanwhile, Tuesday was the deadline for Minneapolis to produce information for a federal grand jury. It is part of a U.S. Justice Department request for records of any effort to stifle the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Officials have denounced it as a bullying tactic.\n\n“We have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide, but when the federal government weaponizes the criminal justice system against political opponents, it’s important to stand up and fight back,” said Ally Peters, spokesperson for Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat.\n\nShe said the city was complying, but she didn't elaborate. Other state and local offices run by Democrats were given subpoenas, though it is not known whether they had the same deadline. People familiar with the matter have told the AP that the subpoenas are related to an investigation into whether Minnesota officials obstructed enforcement through public statements.\n\nNo release for man in Omar incident\n\nElsewhere, a man charged with squirting apple cider vinegar on Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar will remain in jail. U.S. Magistrate Judge David Schultz granted a federal prosecutor's request to keep Anthony Kazmierczak in custody.\n\n“We simply cannot have protesters and people — whatever side of the aisle they’re on — running up to representatives who are conducting official business, and holding town halls, and assaulting them,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Benjamin Bejar said Tuesday.\n\nDefense attorney John Fossum said the vinegar posed a low risk to Omar. He said Kazmierczak's health problems weren't being properly addressed in jail and that his release would be appropriate.\n\nOrder for release of 2 men accused of assaulting ICE officer fails to stick\n\nAnother judge ordered the release of two Venezuelan men who were accused of assaulting an ICE officer, but ICE officials quickly took them back into custody.\n\nAlfredo Aljorna and Julio Sosa-Celis are accused of assaulting the officer the night of Jan. 14. Sosa-Celis was shot in the thigh by the officer during the encounter, triggering protests in Minneapolis.\n\nThe officer said he was struck with a broom and snow shovel while trying to subdue and arrest Aljorna after a car crash and foot chase. But the two men deny assaulting the officer. Neither video evidence nor three eyewitnesses supported the officer’s account.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson held a hearing Tuesday at which he rejected the government’s appeal of a magistrate judge’s order for the release of the two men on the criminal charges. Magnuson ruled that they could go free.\n\nBut an attorney for Sosa-Celis, Robin Wolpert, said in an interview that when she went to speak afterward with her client, who had been in the custody of U.S. Marshals, staff told her that ICE had taken him. She said she wasn’t sure why, or what their next steps would be.\n\nAljorna's attorney, Frederick Goetz, said he didn't know why ICE took his client or their next steps either.\n\nRaza reported from Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

    "fullText": "CEO Alex Karp hails ‘iconic’ financial results despite criticism over contracts with ICE and homeland security\n\nPalantir celebrated its latest financial results on Monday, as the tech company blew past Wall Street expectations and continues to prop up the Trump administration’s push to deport immigrants.\n\nPalantir has secured millions of dollars in federal contracts amid Trump’s crackdown on immigrants. The multibillion-dollar Denver-based firm creates tech focused on surveillance and analytics, to be used by the government agencies and private companies.\n\nPalantir’s biggest US customer is the Department of Defense; it also works with the Department of Homeland Security, and the majority of its revenue comes from deals with the federal government. Palantir reported 66% year-over-year growth in revenue from government contracts, to $570m.\n\nPalantir has drawn further criticism over its role in the government’s immigration agenda, since federal immigration officers killed two protesters in Minneapolis last month.\n\nPalantir chief executive Alex Karp told CNBC in an interview Monday that Palantir helps protect sensitive data. “If you are critical of ICE, you should be out there protesting for more Palantir,” he said. “Our product, actually, in its core, requires people to conform with fourth amendment data protection.”\n\nThe company beat Wall Street expectations of $1.33bn with $1.41bn in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2025. It reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.25 – which also surpassed Wall Street expectations of $0.23 in EPS. The company’s stocks jumped about 8% in after-hours trading after the release.\n\nKarp described the company’s growth on an earnings call as “one of the truly iconic performances in the history of corporate performance”. He wrote in a letter accompanying the earnings report that the $1.4bn in revenue generated in last year’s fourth quarter marks a new record – a 70% growth rate over the same period the year before.\n\n“We did this while supporting, in critical manner, some of the most interesting intricate, unusual, operations that the US government has been involved in – many of which we can’t comment on – but were the highlight of last year and highly motivating to all of us at Palantir,” Karp said.\n\nKarp doubled down on his data protection claim on the call, arguing that Palantir’s work with the US government, including intelligence agencies, aligns with the fourth amendment and makes sure “every institution that uses (Palantir’s) products is doing it within conformity of the law and ethics of America”.\n\nData privacy advocates are not convinced. “Palantir tools are ICE’s digital henchmen,” said Will Owen, communications director at the non-profit, Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, in a statement to the Guardian. “Their revenue may be up thanks to Trump, but no one is buying that they hold ICE accountable.”\n\nLast year, ICE awarded Palantir a nearly $30m contract to build ImmigrationOS, which makes it easier to pull information about immigrants from across government databases – regardless of the accuracy of those records. 404 Media recently reported on the existence of another tool created by Palantir for the federal government: Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement (Elite).\n\nElite “populates a map with potential deportation targets, brings up a dossier on each person, and provides a ‘confidence score’ on the person’s current address”, according to 404 Media. The program reportedly relies on address data from the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes Medicaid.\n\nWired reported last week that the federal government has been using Palantir’s AI tools to process immigration enforcement tips. Wired also reported that the health department has been using other Palantir AI tools to screen grants and job descriptions for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), and “gender ideology”.\n\nPalantir has said there is no malicious intent in its work with the federal government.\n\n“To be absolutely clear, Palantir is not working on any master database project to unify databases across federal agencies,” read a company blogpost last week. “Palantir has not proposed the US government build a ‘master list’ for the surveillance of citizens, nor have we been asked to consider building such a system for any customer.”\n\nPalantir has described 404 Media’s claims about the Elite tool as misleading; the company says it is “used for prioritized enforcement to surface the likely addresses of specific individuals, such as those with final orders of removal or with high severity criminal charges”.\n\nTrump’s “big, beautiful bill” awarded DHS and ICE huge budgets to pursue the administration’s anti-immigrant policies, including $45bn for ICE to expand its detention capabilities.\n\nIn 2025, Palantir’s federal contracts almost doubled – and increased to more than $970m; this amount was distributed across the government, mostly to the defense department, but it also includes the DHS.",

    "fullText": "Former ESPN host Sage Steele mocked the musicians who criticized Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the Grammys because, she said, they are too ignorant to opine.\n\nOn Sunday, several prominent musicians slammed ICE amid the ongoing and sometimes violent raids by the agency and Border Patrol. Last month, agents fatally shot two U.S. citizens in separate incidents in Minneapolis, where the Trump administration has deployed about 3,000 immigration agents, who have detained children and arrested asylum-seekers. According to an internal memo, ICE officials told its agents that they do not need a judicial warrant to enter people’s homes.\n\nAt the Grammys on Sunday night, several musicians spoke out against ICE. While accepting the award for Best Música Urbana Album, Bad Bunny, who will perform during the Super Bowl halftime show, said, “Before I say thanks to God, I’m gonna say: ICE out!”\n\nKehlani, who won Best R&B Performance, told the Grammys crowd, “F*ck ICE.”\n\nOn Monday’s Jesse Watters Primetime on Fox News, Steele, a former SportsCenter host, ripped the anti-ICE sentiment.\n\n“I only watched for about 15 minutes, but it was enough to really set the tone for what I knew what it would ultimately be,” she said. “And I gotta tell you, none of us should be surprised at this point, but it is still disappointing.”\n\nSteele went on to reference a refrain by Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who in 2018 ripped LeBron James for criticizing President Donald Trump.\n\n“Keep the political comments to yourselves,” Ingraham said at the time. “Shut up and dribble.”\n\n“And I’d liken it to what the great Laura Ingraham said years ago,” Steele said. “‘Shut up and dribble.’ It isn’t because we didn’t want to hear athletes’ opinions on things. Maybe here or there, but it’s because we learned that they don’t tend to base it in fact. They base it on TikTok news or left-wing media narratives instead of the facts. If you go on fact, and give me your opinion from there, then fine. And that’s exactly what the Hollywood elites are choosing not to do as well, and it was an incredibly pathetic, but not surprising display by all of those on that stage yesterday.”\n\nSteele later added, “This is why, shut up and dribble, shut up and sing, because you’re super talented, but you don’t know what you’re talking about.”\n\nA Fox News poll released last week shows that 59% of American voters believe ICE has been “too aggressive” in its tactics. Meanwhile, a plurality (46%) of Americans want the agency abolished, according to a YouGov survey last month.\n\nThe post Former SportsCenter Host Tells Anti-ICE Musicians to ‘Shut Up’ Because ‘You Don’t Know What You’re Talking About’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

Lemon asked to see a warrant and was told they didn't have it. The agents then summoned an FBI agent to come in from outside to show Lemon the warrant on a cell phone.\n\nThe Department of Justice and FBI didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nKimmel introduced Lemon, his first guest of the night, by saying he was “was arrested for committing journalism.”\n\nLemon’s attorney has said Lemon plans to plead not guilty. He told reporters “I will not be silenced” after he was released in response to a judge's orders.\n\nA grand jury in Minnesota indicted Lemon, another independent journalist, Georgia Fort, and others on charges of conspiracy and interfering with the First Amendment rights of worshippers during the Jan. 18 protest at the Cities Church in St. Paul, where a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official is a pastor.\n\nLemon, who was fired from CNN in 2023 following a bumpy run as a morning host, has said he had no affiliation to the group that disrupted the Sunday service by entering the church.\n\nLemon said he couldn't say much about the case but he said he was not a protester.\n\n“I went there to be a journalist. I went there to chronicle and document and record what was happening. I was following that one group around, and so that’s what I did. I reported on them,” Lemon said.\n\nLemon said he asked the arresting officers if they would let him make a phone call. He said he was told no and that he could talk to his attorney the next day. He tried to use Siri on his Apple Watch to call his husband and his attorney but neither picked up.\n\nA diamond bracelet he was wearing kept getting caught on his handcuffs, which hurt, and the agents told Lemon they would take it off. Lemon said he asked if the agent would mind taking it up to Lemon's husband in his hotel room and they agreed to do that.\n\n“And that’s how my husband found out. Otherwise, no one would have known where I was,” Lemon said.\n\nLemon said he was kept in a holding room at the federal courthouse from midnight until 1 p.m. the following day.\n\nKimmel himself became a symbol of a fight against censorship last year, when ABC suspended “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” for remarks made following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr had pressured broadcasters to take Kimmel off the air shortly before that.\n\nABC lifted the suspension after a public outcry, and Kimmel returned to the air with much stronger ratings than he had before. In Congress, Democratic senators raised concerns that Carr’s actions trampled on the First Amendment.",

It required 7-days’ warning for visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities being funded exclusively by the “Big Beautiful Bill” that Republicans passed last summer. That bill did not include the rider.\n\nCobb rejected the policy, crediting the lawmakers’ contention that it would be logistically difficult to segregate which expenses are being funded by which law.\n\n“Defendants’ declarant provides almost no details or specifics as to how DHS and ICE would accomplish this task in the face of the practical challenges raised by Plaintiffs,” wrote Cobb, an appointee of former President Biden.\n\nThe Hill has reached out to a DHS spokesperson for comment.\n\nThe suit was filed by 13 Democratic members of Congress: Joe Neguse (Colo.), Adriano Espaillat (N.Y.), Bennie Thompson (Miss.), Jamie Raskin (Md.), Robert Garcia (Calif.), Lou Correa (Calif.), Jason Crow (Colo.), Veronica Escobar (Texas), Dan Goldman (N.Y.), Jimmy Gomez (Calif.), Raul Ruiz (Calif.), Norma Torrez (Calif.) and Kelly Morrison (Minn.).\n\nTheir latest push in court came after the lawmakers said they tried to visit an ICE facility in Minnesota three days after the fatal shooting of Renée Good by a federal agent.\n\n“The Court’s decision today to grant a temporary restraining order against ICE’s unlawful effort to obstruct congressional oversight is a victory for the American people. We will keep fighting to ensure the rule of law prevails,” Neguse, a member of House Democratic leadership, said in a statement.\n\nThe lawmakers are represented by American Oversight and Democracy Forward Foundation, two organizations that regularly back lawsuits against the Trump administration.",

    "description": "A newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch delivered a sharp warning to President Donald Trump after a high-profile Republican loss.

    "fullText": "A newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch delivered a sharp warning to President Donald Trump after a high-profile Republican loss.\n\nIn a new editorial, The Wall Street Journal warned Trump that a hardline immigration strategy promoted by top aide Stephen Miller is fueling voter backlash.\n\nIt comes after a Trump-endorsed candidate for the Texas state senate lost to a Democrat over the weekend.\n\n“How does a Republican lose by 14 points in a safe conservative Texas state Senate seat that President Trump carried by 17 points in 2024? Answer: When there’s a voter backlash against the Trump Administration, notably its mass deportation debacles,” the Journal wrote, describing the special election in Tarrant County.\n\nDemocrat Taylor Rehmet, a labor union leader and veteran, easily defeated Republican Leigh Wambsganss, who had Trump’s endorsement on Truth Social and vastly outspent her opponent.\n\nRehment is the first Democrat to hold the seat in decades.\n\nThe paper noted the timing was disastrous for Republicans, coming after the high-profile Minneapolis killings by federal immigration agents. “The 31-point vote swing in a little more than 14 months can only be explained as part of a rising tide of opposition to Mr. Trump’s first year and a sour public mood,” the Journal observed.\n\nThe White House has faced mounting national backlash after federal immigration agents fatally shot two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis—Renee Good in early January and Alex Pretti later that month—as part of aggressive enforcement operations in the state.\n\nBoth cases sparked controversy over conflicting official narratives. In Pretti’s case, Homeland Security officials and White House aides initially claimed he approached agents with a gun and posed a threat, while bystander videos show him holding only a cellphone before being pinned down and shot.\n\nSimilarly, authorities initially suggested that Good tried to ram agents with her vehicle before she was fatally shot, a claim contradicted by eyewitness footage and reporting. Critics argue these early statements painted both victims as dangerous to justify the shootings, fueling accusations that the administration misrepresented the events.\n\nThe killings came after Trump deployed thousands of federal immigration agents to Minneapolis as part of an aggressive immigration strategy masterminded by Miller.\n\nMiller’s immigration strategy under Trump has pushed aggressive mass arrests and deportations, with ICE agents pressured to meet high daily quotas, even targeting non-criminal undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal critiqued Miller’s hardline tactics, including a daily quota of 3,000 migrant arrests that it says “was bound to result in agent intrusions into homes and businesses.”\n\nWhile immigration has historically been a winning issue for Republicans, the Journal cautioned that enforcement “that turns ugly in the streets is turning off the swing voters who will determine who wins the race for Congress this year.”\n\nPolls have recently shown Americans turning on Trump and his immigration strategy ahead of the 2026 Midterms. A YouGov poll conducted on January 25 showed that about half (48 percent) of respondents do not think the shooting of Pretti in Minneapolis was justified.\n\nAnother YouGov poll showed that 52 percent of Americans think the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict immigration to the U.S. have gone too far.\n\nAs a result, the paper concluded that even as Trump signals a desire to “dial back the confrontations on the street,” he must also reconsider Miller’s influence. “The Miller strategy isn’t likely to fare better this year,” the editorial warned.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal is not the first Murdoch-owned newspaper to publicly condemn Trump’s immigration strategy.\n\nIn an op-ed published last week, the New York Post argued that the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement in Minneapolis is backfiring politically.\n\n“These enforcement tactics won’t turn the tide, instead they are backfiring,” the Post wrote.",

    "description": "Bad Bunny's historic Grammy win for \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos\" highlights the intersection of art and politics amid ongoing immigration protests.",
    "fullText": "We expect political statements when they're delivered on podiums or with policy briefs. This one arrived with a golden gramophone.\n\nOn Sunday at the 2026 Grammy Awards, the Recording Academy bestowed its highest honor on Bad Bunny's \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos,\" the first all-Spanish album in history to win album of the year.\n\nAs the Los Angeles crowd erupted in applause, Bad Bunny appeared overcome with emotion, hunching in his chair and shielding his teary eyes with his hand. The lyrics to \"DTMF,\" a song about seeking refuge in community, reverberated through the venue.\n\nIt was a historic moment, but it was also, quite plainly, a political one. Voters chose to celebrate a musical love letter to Puerto Rico during a period of peak anti-immigrant messaging from the US government. President Donald Trump's mass deportation efforts have disproportionately targeted Latino communities, a recent UCLA analysis found, and in September, the Supreme Court lifted restrictions on racial profiling for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Now, simply speaking Spanish in public, or even speaking English with an accent, is grounds to be stopped and even detained for questioning.\n\nFor a proud Latino artist and native Spanish speaker to become the biggest winner on \"music's biggest night\" — and for him to make his acceptance speech largely in Spanish — is in itself an implicit yet firm protest. Even so, Bad Bunny did not stop at implicit. He called out ICE while accepting the award for best música urbana album earlier in the ceremony, pointedly doing so in English for maximum impact. \"We're not savage. We're not animals. We're not aliens,\" he said. \"We are humans, and we are Americans.\"\n\nThere has always been a significant swath of Americans who insist that politics has no place in art, and that artists like Bad Bunny should stick to song and dance. Some fans and conservative pundits claimed Taylor Swift ruined her career after she publicly endorsed Democratic candidates in 2018. Back in the early aughts, The Chicks were blacklisted in Nashville for criticizing then-President George W. Bush; a documentary about the band released in 2006 is titled \"Shut Up and Sing.\"\n\nEven some artists feel this way. After winning three awards on Sunday, country star Jelly Roll side-stepped questions about the political climate: \"I can tell you that people shouldn't care to hear my opinion,\" he told reporters in the press room.\n\nJust a few days before the Grammys, Sydney Sweeney expressed a similar sentiment, arguing that her work as an actor exempts her from civic engagement.\n\n\"I'm not a political person. I'm in the arts,\" she told Cosmopolitan. \"I'm not here to speak on politics. That's not an area I've ever even imagined getting into.\"\n\nPerhaps Jelly Roll, Sweeney, and their like-minded contingent would have preferred Bad Bunny to steer clear of political statements on the Grammys stage. Yet his very presence on that stage neutralizes such a preference. Even if all he said was a quick thanks, he'd be accepting an award with political implications.\n\n\"Debí Tirar Más Fotos\" is a body of work that deliberately engages with some of the most urgent and contentious questions of our time — questions of identity, belonging, American imperialism, and cultural preservation. Bad Bunny told The New York Times that in making this album, he aimed to use his platform for more than just selling records and topping charts; he wanted to \"plant a seed,\" especially for young people in Puerto Rico, to think critically about their roots, their heritage, and the forces that threaten to consume them.\n\nOf course, you can enjoy \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos\" without analyzing the lyrics or even understanding the language. That still doesn't mean you can appraise these songs (or the man who sings them) in a pure, apolitical vacuum. What the Grammy voters heard, judged, and justly rewarded was art informed by the world around it.\n\nIndeed, Toni Morrison's famous quote rings true: All good art is political. But in the same interview from 2008, the Nobel Prize-winning author went on to make an equally important point: That even the most shallow, avoidant, vapid-sounding artists are making political statements without meaning to.\n\n\"All of that art-for-art's-sake stuff is BS,\" Morrison said. \"What are these people talking about? Are you really telling me that Shakespeare and Aeschylus weren't writing about kings? All good art is political! There is none that isn't. And the ones that try hard not to be political are political by saying, 'We love the status quo.'\"",

    "fullText": "The father of a 5-year-old boy who was detained by immigration officers and held at an federal facility in Texas denied government accounts Monday that he abandoned his son as the pair returned to Minnesota.\n\nAdrian Conejo Arias, who is originally from Ecudador, told ABC News that he loves his son, Liam, and would never abandon him, disputing statements from the Department of Homeland Security, which alleged that Arias had left his child in a vehicle. He also said his son got sick while in federal custody but was denied medicine.\n\nAssistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that Arias fled on foot before he was arrested, “abandoning his child.” She said Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers stayed with the boy.\n\n“The facts in this case have NOT changed: The father who was illegally in the country chose to take his child with him to a detention center,\" she said.\n\nMcLaughlin did not address Arias' statement that his son was denied medication while in custody.\n\nArias also said he was arrested unjustly and contended he was in the country legally, with a pending court hearing for asylum.\n\nThe comments come after a federal judge ordered over the weekend that the pair be freed. They were released Sunday and returned to Minnesota, according to Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas.\n\nThe family's arrest and release unfolded during President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration, which has led to daily protests that included the shooting deaths of two American citizens by federal officers. The president last week ordered his top border adviser to oversee the crackdown days after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti, an intensive care nurse at a Veterans Affairs hospital.\n\nBorder czar Tom Homan suggested that mistakes have been made, but he said agents would continue to enforce federal law and called on local and state officials to cooperate with federal officers.\n\nThe boy's detention drew outrage as images of immigration officers surrounding the young boy in a blue bunny hat and Spider-Man backpack began to surface.\n\nMcLaughlin said ICE did not target or arrest the boy, and she repeated assertions that his mother refused to take him after his father’s apprehension. His father told officers he wanted Liam to be with him, she said.\n\nMcLaughlin also said last month that the child was abandoned and that officers tried to get the mother to take custody of the child. “Officers even assured her she would NOT be taken into custody.”\n\nNeighbors and school officials said federal officers used the child as “bait,” telling him to knock on his house’s door so his mother would come out. DHS disputed that description.\n\nMarcos Charles, acting executive associate director of ICE enforcement and removal operations, faulted the father for “abandoning his child in the middle of winter in a vehicle.” He told reporters one officer stayed with the child while others arrested the father.\n\nThe government said the boy’s father entered the U.S. illegally from Ecuador in December 2024. The family’s lawyer said he has a pending asylum claim that allows him to stay in the U.S.\n\nThe vast majority of asylum-seekers are released in the United States, with adults having eligibility for work permits, while their cases wind through a backlogged court system.\n\nEcuadorians, who left in droves in recent years as their country spiraled into violence, have fared poorly in immigration court, with judges granting asylum in 12.5% of decisions in the 12-month period through September, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering and research organization based at Syracuse University.\n\nIn ordering the release of Liam and his father, U.S. District Judge Fred Biery blasted the administration, writing that the case had “its genesis in the ill-conceived and incompetently-implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatizing children.”\n\nThe Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review’s online court docket shows no future hearings for Liam’s father.",

    "fullText": "The Grammy Awards are music's biggest night. This year, they were also a night when music's biggest stars made pointed political statements.\n\nAs President Trump's immigration crackdown rages on amid nationwide protests, musicians used their time on the Grammys stage to make their feelings known.\n\nThe biggest moment of the night came when Bad Bunny dedicated his album of the year award for \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos\" — the first all-Spanish album in history to triumph in the prestigious category — to \"all the people that had to leave their homeland, their country, to follow their dreams.\"\n\nEarlier in the evening, he used another speech to directly criticize Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\"Before I say thanks to God, I'm going to say ICE out,\" the Puerto Rican singer said while accepting the award for best música urbana album.\n\nThe chart-topping superstar, who's also set to headline the Super Bowl halftime show next week, continued his speech by emphasizing the humanity of his fellow Latinos and Puerto Ricans.\n\n\"We're not savage,\" he said. \"We're not animals. We're not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans.\"\n\n\"The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love,\" he added.\n\nDuring an in-audience bit with Grammys host Trevor Noah, Bad Bunny clarified that Puerto Ricans are Americans.\n\n\"If things keep getting bad here in America, can I come live with you in Puerto Rico?\" Noah joked.\n\n\"Trevor, I have news for you,\" Bad Bunny replied. \"Puerto Rico is part of America.\"\n\nBad Bunny previously told i-D magazine that he decided to skip the mainland on his latest tour because he didn't want ICE agents waiting outside his concerts.\n\n\"There were many reasons why I didn't show up in the US, and none of them were out of hate — I've performed there many times,\" he said. \"I've enjoyed connecting with Latinos who have been living in the US. But specifically, for a residency here in Puerto Rico, when we are an unincorporated territory of the US… People from the US could come here to see the show. Latinos and Puerto Ricans of the United States could also travel here, or to any part of the world. But there was the issue of — like, fucking ICE could be outside. And it's something that we were talking about and very concerned about.\"\n\nOther winners echoed Bad Bunny's message at the ceremony on Sunday, including London native and \"Nice to Each Other\" singer Olivia Dean, who spoke about her immigrant roots while accepting the award for best new artist.\n\n\"I'm up here as a granddaughter of an immigrant,\" Dean said. \"I'm a product of bravery, and I think those people deserve to be celebrated.\"\n\nLater in the evening, Billie Eilish followed suit when she accepted song of the year for \"Wildflower,\" a ballad from her latest album, \"Hit Me Hard and Soft.\"\n\n\"No one is illegal on stolen land,\" Eilish said onstage.\n\n\"It's just really hard to know what to say and what to do right now,\" she added. \"I feel like we just need to keep fighting and protesting. Our voices really do matter, and the people do matter.\"\n\nEven more Grammy attendees wore \"ICE out\" pins to the ceremony, including Eilish, her brother and producer Finneas O'Connell, Carole King, Justin Bieber, Hailey Bieber, and Kehlani, who won best R&B performance during the Grammys premiere ceremony.\n\n\"I really wanted to say fuck ICE,\" Kehlani told The Hollywood Reporter on the red carpet. \"We're too powerful of a group to all be in a room at the same time and not make some kind of statement in our country. It's brainless to me.\"",

Never more so than in recent weeks, when federal immigration officers killed two U.S. citizens during Trump'scrackdownin Minneapolis.  “In the beginning, they were getting criminals, but now they're tearing people out of immigration proceedings, looking for the tiniest traffic infraction” to deport someone, said Niedermeier.",
    "fullText": "GREELEY, Colo (AP) — Like many Donald Trump voters, Miranda Niedermeier is not opposed to immigration enforcement. She was heartened by initial moves from the Republican president in his second term that she saw as targeting immigrants who were in the United States illegally and had committed crimes.\n\nBut Niedermeier, 35, has steadily become disillusioned with Trump. Never more so than in recent weeks, when federal immigration officers killed two U.S. citizens during Trump'scrackdownin Minneapolis.\n\n“In the beginning, they were getting criminals, but now they're tearing people out of immigration proceedings, looking for the tiniest traffic infraction” to deport someone, said Niedermeier. She said she is horrified because the administration's approach is not Christian.\n\n“It shouldn't be life and death,\" she said. \"We're not a Third World country. What the hell is going on?”\n\nTrump's immigration drive in Minnesota, and the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, has resonated across the farms, oil and gas rigs, and shopping centers of Colorado's 8th Congressional District, a swing seat stretching northeast from Denver. The monthlong turmoil in Minnesota has reinforced the political views of some in the U.S. House district while making others reconsider their own.\n\n“He should cool it on immigration,” said Edgar Cautle, a 30-year-old Mexican American oil field worker who said he is a Trump fan but is increasingly distressed by images of immigration agents detaining children and splitting families apart. “It's making people not like him.”\n\nRepublican congressman wants ICE to focus on criminals\n\nIf such sentiments hold until the fall, that could imperil House Republicans who won their seats by narrow margins and could jeopardize the GOP’s full control of political power in Washington.\n\nEven a small shift is significant in the 8th District, where Republican Gabe Evans was elected to Congress in 2024 by 2,449 votes out of more than 333,000 cast. His seat is one of the Democrats' top targets as they push to retake the House in November.\n\nEvans is a former police officer whose mother is Mexican American. He has urged the administration to focus on deporting criminals rather than people in the country illegally who are otherwise obeying the law — as Evans puts it, “gangbangers, not grandmas.”\n\nIn an interview, Evans said he is worried about the assertion by Immigration and Customs Enforcement that it can search homes with just an administrative warrant rather than one signed by a judge. He said he looks forward to questioning Department of Homeland Security officials during an upcoming House hearing.\n\nStill, Evans blamed Democrats for the Minneapolis standoff and the broader impression that ICE is out of control.\n\n“One side wants to fan the flames and equivocate in this space because they want an issue to run on in November,” he said.\n\nHe noted that ICE has stepped lightly in his district, with narrowly tailored operations aimed at criminals rather than the local industries that rely on immigrant workers.\n\n“We have big meatpacking plants, we have big dairies, we have places where, if ICE was trying to meet a quota, you would see ICE going to them,” Evans said.\n\nVoters conflicted over approach to immigration enforcement\n\nSome 4 of 10 voters in Evans' district are Hispanic. In more than two dozen interviews across the district, every voter who identified as Hispanic spoke of being offended by Trump's immigration crackdown. Many — U.S. citizens all — feared for their own safety.\n\n“I don't know if, just because of my last name or how I look, they might go after me,” said Jennifer Hernandez, 30, as she entered a Walmart in the town of Brighton.\n\nPlenty of other voters supported the Minnesota operation, even after the shootings of Good and Pretti.\n\n“They've got to clean up the immigrants, definitely,” said Herb Smith, a 61-year-old generator installer and Trump voter.\n\nSmith, who is Black, said he once lived in Minneapolis and left because of the Somali immigrants who have drawn Trump's ire: “Trump's right, these people are poisoning our people.”\n\nDominic Morrison, 39, a telecommunications technician, said he does not like to see people lose their lives, but feels enforcing immigration laws is necessary.\n\n“I know everybody wants a better life and better situation, but if I went somewhere else without permission they wouldn't take nicely to it,” Morrison said.\n\nRacial profiling has some ‘walking on eggshells’\n\nDemocrats in the district said they are enraged by the enforcement surge and blame Evans along with Trump.\n\n“He's said nothing against it,” said Jim Getman, a retired electrical technician who volunteered for Democrats in 2024. “He's always supported Trump in everything he does.”\n\nJoe Hernandez, 27, pays far less attention to politics. But the forklift operator and his family members — all citizens or legal residents — are fearful they could be swept up by immigration officers who are racially profiling people.\n\n“We're walking on eggshells right now,” Hernandez said as he filled up a water jug at a tap outside a Mexican supermarket in Commerce City, a heavily immigrant city at the southern end of the 8th District.\n\nHernandez said it has gotten so bad that he and his four siblings, all citizens born in the United States have considered moving to property his family owns in Mexico for their safety. He did not vote in 2024 and has never cast a ballot before, like many he knows.\n\nHe intends to change that this year, and he thinks he is not the only one.\n\n“More people are like, oh ... we've got to vote,” he said.",

    "description": "Across Minneapolis, Target employees are marching and volunteering amid the immigration crackdown, while pressing company leadership to do more",
    "fullText": "Suzie lifted the box of diapers from her trunk and glanced down the street to be sure she hadn't been followed. It was a bright Thursday afternoon, and her boots crunched across the icy Minneapolis pavement as she crossed to the curtain-drawn house of a Target coworker.\n\nThe street was quiet. It was just a few blocks from where Renee Good, a mother of three, was shot and killed by an ICE agent three weeks earlier. The coworker, who is Latina, has been too afraid to venture into a store.\n\n\"The first time I did this, I was very nervous — almost paranoid,\" said Suzie, who asked not to be identified by her full name. She had taken a roundabout route and turned off her phone's location tracking.\n\nSuzie is a 15-year Target employee who works in merchandising at its downtown headquarters. Now, she's also part of an informal mutual-aid network that has emerged among the company's corporate workforce as Minneapolis — where Target is one of the largest employers — has become ground zero for the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.\n\nShe doesn't consider herself an activist. \"It's just neighbors taking care of neighbors,\" she said. \"It takes away the helplessness of feeling like the government's against us. It's something you can actually do, instead of sitting on your phone feeling depressed.\"\n\nAcross Minneapolis, Target employees are among the thousands of residents who are out marching, offering help to neighbors, and standing watch in sub-freezing temperatures — while pressing company leadership in Slack channels to more forcefully condemn the administration's actions.\n\nThat urgency has collided with growing frustration inside Target itself. In an open letter sent to leadership last week, hundreds of Target employees wrote that \"Target's continued inaction in the face of the current administration puts all of us at risk of more harm in our workplaces and represents a moral failure to protect those in our community.\"\n\nTwo days later, after federal agents shot and killed 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti, Target's incoming CEO, Michael Fiddelke, joined dozens of Minnesota business leaders in calling for \"de-escalation of tensions.\"\n\nIn a video to employees, he described the violence as \"incredibly painful,\" but stopped short of condemning the killings or criticizing the Trump administration, which has cited Minneapolis's sanctuary city policies as the reason for the enforcement surge. Target also contributed to a $3.5 million fund for small businesses affected by the disruptions.\n\nSome employees say that's a start, but not enough for them.\n\nAt Art Price Studio, a screen printer in Northeast Minneapolis, its owner said that at least a dozen people have come in with Target's red uniforms and tote bags and asked for anti-ICE slogans like \"ICE OUT!\" to be printed onto them.\n\nAcross town, a logistics specialist who's worked for Target for 4 years spends much of her free time volunteering as a neighborhood lookout. A few days a week, she stands outside local restaurants during shift changes to keep an eye out for approaching federal law enforcement agents and offers rides home to frightened workers.\n\nAnother Target employee, who works in merchandising and has been with the company for seven years, uses a 3D printer to make whistles — the instrument of choice for protesters to warn their neighbors to the arrival of federal agents and be witnesses to any violence. The whistles are then paired with laminated \"Know Your Rights\" cards, made in six different languages, which volunteers like Suzie drop off at local coffee shops and bookstores.\n\nThe employee, who is of Vietnamese origin, has mostly been working from home since Target's corporate office relaxed its requirement for employees to work in the office three times a week in response to ICE's activities and unrest in the city.\n\nEven though she's a US citizen, she wants to avoid the ICE run-ins that other family members and friends have experienced.\n\nAnother Target employee, who works in merchandising and has been with the company for seven years, uses a 3D printer to make whistles — the instrument of choice for protesters to warn their neighbors to the arrival of federal agents and be witnesses to any violence. The whistles are then paired with manuals, made in six different languages, which volunteers like Suzie drop off at local coffee shops and bookstores.\n\nOn the few occasions she's gone into the Target offices, she's been struck by how many employees of color seem to be staying home. \"It's like, wow, all my white colleagues are here. My colleagues of color are not,\" she said.\n\nLike many employees interviewed by Business Insider, she said she feels a disconnect between how she's experiencing the events in Minneapolis and Target's public statements.\n\n\"It's hard to show up at work and put my own values aside. It doesn't feel good.\"\n\nFive and a half years ago, when George Floyd was killed less than 4 miles from Target's Minneapolis headquarters, the company's response was different. The retail giant, which at the time made social justice a cornerstone of its business, reacted with a sweeping, highly visible show of support.\n\nTarget pledged $10 million to social-justice organizations and scaled up its DEI programs. \"Target stands with black families, communities and team members,\" then-CEO Brian Cornell said in a statement. Floyd, he said, \"could have been one of my Target team members.\"\n\nLike much of corporate America, Target has softened its public embrace of progressive causes in recent years. In last week's open letter, employees criticized the company's decision to scale back its LGBTQ Pride collection, its $1 million donation to Trump's inauguration fund, and its winding down of several DEI initiatives last year.\n\nThe recent events in Minneapolis are putting that strategy to the test. And the protests also come at a delicate time for Target. Fiddelke, a company veteran who most recently served as COO, will take over the top role on Sunday; Cornell will stay on as the board's executive chairman.\n\nFiddelke will have to contend with returning Target to growth after three years of lackluster sales performance and a stock price that is down roughly 25% from a year ago.\n\nIn the days after Pretti's killing, Target managers held listening sessions with their staff. Some employees used town hall-style forums to vent their anger and frustration at not doing more, according to an employee who attended multiple such forums.\n\nOne corporate Slack channel that Business Insider has seen is called \"#yelling\" and was originally intended for venting about \"situations or things, not people.\" It has roughly 3,600 employees, about half the number Target employs at its Twin Cities headquarters. The channel has lately become an outlet for frustrations with government and corporate leadership alike, as well as sharing links to community-aid resources.\n\nIn the days before Pretti was killed, the tone of the channel was largely defiant, peppered with anti-ICE memes. After the company appeared to avoid taking sides on the issue, it turned to outrage.\n\nThe military-style immigration raids across the metro area have stirred a widespread sense of paranoia. More than 3,500 people have been arrested in the Twin Cities in the last two months, including on school grounds and outside day cares. Overnight on Thursday, federal agents arrested the former CNN anchor Don Lemon and another journalist who had covered a local protest at a church.\n\nA federal judge has said ICE is in violation of nearly 100 court orders involving noncitizens its agents have apprehended.\n\nResidents dropping off groceries for neighbors or helping out with laundry say they worry about face-scanning technology and cell phone surveillance. They mostly coordinate over the encrypted messaging platform Signal.\n\nEmployees who volunteer say they block off time on their work calendars or set an out-of-office Slack status. Some have been stepping away to look out for immigration patrols at their neighborhood schools before and after classes.\n\nIn a video to employees, he described the violence as \"incredibly painful,\" but stopped short of condemning the killings or criticizing the Trump administration,\n\nAt the team level, employees say, there has been patience and flexibility from managers and coworkers.\n\nA military veteran who has worked at Target for more than five years said his direct supervisor and his supervisor's supervisor have been \"unquestionably, unwaveringly\" supportive. That has meant flexibility to adjust schedules and workloads to accommodate things like extra grocery runs, carpools, and mental health days.\n\nBut the person said the company's official statements have been disappointing.\n\n\"When I started with the company, I was very proud,\" the person said. He says the company's neutrality — broadly calling for \"deescalation\" — has been disappointing, and he's now much less likely to share that he's a Target employee.\n\n​​He referenced a Wednesday statement by outdoor supply company Patagonia — which operates a retail store in St. Paul — that condemned \"government-sanctioned violence\" and opposing increased funding for DHS and ICE.\n\n\"This is what leadership I want to follow looks like,\" the Target worker said of Patagonia's statement.\n\nSeveral other employees say they've lost their sense of pride in being Target employees since the company shifted to a more cautious approach. One person who has worked there for 12 years says Target's handling of DEI issues was a breaking point for her.\n\n\"I personally am boycotting Target and have for the past year, which is, I realize, very ironic, considering I work for them,\" she said. \"My friends and family around me, they're not shopping Target right now. They're mad.\"\n\nThe merchandiser who prints whistles and \"Know Your Rights\" cards said she's glad her coworkers and neighbors are taking action.\n\n\"I feel like Minnesotans can take it and our strong community is really fighting back,\" she said.\n\nSam Fellman is a journalist at Business Insider who oversees the Military & Defense team. He lives in Minneapolis.\n\nDominick Reuter is a senior retail reporter for Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "A law enforcement agency executing the Trump administration's immigration crackdown has been described as a serial violator of court orders in Minnesota.\n\nThe declaration didn't come from the Democratic governor or Minneapolis' Democratic mayor, who have repeatedly traded barbs with President Donald Trump. It was a federal judge with a conservative pedigree who has added a powerful voice to a saga that has stirred the nation.\n\n“ICE is not a law unto itself,” Chief U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz wrote this week, referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nSchiltz wasn't referring to the tactics of immigration officers, who have killed two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis, burst into homes with battering rams, smashed windows and pulled people from cars, and tossed tear gas at irate protesters.\n\nRather, after surveying other judges in his court, Schiltz was talking about the government's failure to comply with nearly 100 court orders since Jan. 1 in 74 cases in which people arrested during Operation Metro Surge have sued seeking release or other relief. Even that number, he said, is \"almost certainly substantially understated.\"\n\n“This list should give pause to anyone — no matter his or her political beliefs — who cares about the rule of law. ... ICE has every right to challenge the orders of this Court, but, like any litigant, ICE must follow those orders unless and until they are overturned or vacated,” Schiltz wrote.\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Homeland Security Department, called Schiltz's declaration a “diatribe from this activist judge.\"\n\n“We will not be deterred by activists either in the streets or on the bench,” she said in a statement.\n\nDeputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller also slammed the judge’s comments on social media: “The judicial sabotage of democracy is unending.”\n\nSchiltz is among several judges who have called out the federal government and tried to keep officials accountable during a remarkable surge of immigration enforcement. U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez prohibited officers from using tear gas or pepper spray against peaceful protesters in Minnesota, though an appeal has put it on hold.\n\nIn November, a Chicago federal judge put similar limits on the use of force and said a Border Patrol commander lied about threats faced by officers. An appeals court halted the remedy, and the lawsuit was recently dropped as tensions eased.\n\nSchiltz, 65, has been a judge for about 20 years after being nominated by Republican President George W. Bush. He served as a law clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a noted conservative jurist, and was a practicing attorney and law professor.\n\n“This is not a judge who courts controversy,” said Mark Osler, a former federal prosecutor who teaches law at the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis.\n\n“He has a deep belief in the rule of law,\" Osler said. “Our social contract includes that when government officials are ordered by the courts to do something, there should be a good faith effort to make that happen. When we lose that we lose the accountability for government that an ordered society requires.\"\n\nOn Monday, Schiltz said he was taking the “extraordinary” step of ordering ICE's acting director, Todd Lyons, to appear and explain why he should not be held in contempt for the agency's failure to comply with orders. The Department of Homeland Security responded by calling him an “activist judge.” Schiltz canceled the hearing after an immigrant in that case was released.\n\nSchiltz acknowledged to Fox News Digital that he has donated to Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, which gives free counsel to immigrants, and Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid. He said he believes poor people should get access to legal help.",

    "title": "Donald Trump Skips Over Kristi Noem During Cabinet Meeting After She's Sidelined from Minneapolis ICE Operation",
    "description": "Noem's actions as homeland security secretary have been under fire following recent incidents with federal immigration agents",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump skipped over Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during a Jan. 29 Cabinet meeting\n\nTrump also made the rare move of refusing questions from the press following the meeting\n\nKaitlan Collins, CNN's chief White House correspondent, suggested that Trump's actions allowed the administration to avoid addressing recent DHS controversies from Minneapolis and heightened scrutiny about Noem's leadership\n\nPresident Donald Trump added more fuel to the rumors about Kristi Noem's job security during a Cabinet meeting on Thursday, Jan. 29.\n\nTrump's televised Cabinet meetings — where his top advisers take turns updating him on their departments' priorities — have become opportunities to tout the administration's achievements and comment on current events, however two notable actions by Trump prevented that from happening on Thursday, as many wondered how he would acknowledge the ongoing criticism toward the Department of Homeland Security and its controversial presence in Minnesota.\n\nThe federal immigration operation in Minneapolis has been a source of great backlash for the Trump administration, including with the fatal officer-involved shootings of American citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti; distressing updates about 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos, whose ICE detainment while returning home from preschool with his father went viral; and the recent attack on Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar while she was condemning DHS Secretary Noem at a town hall.\n\nWhile Trump called on many members of his Cabinet for updates on issues like housing, the economy, the ongoing situation in Venezuela and more during Thursday's meeting, CNN chief White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins was quick to note afterward that he skipped over Noem, preventing her from addressing the criticism surrounding her leadership of federal immigration agencies.\n\nTrump also ended the meeting abruptly and, in an exceedingly rare move for the 47th president, declined to take questions from the assembled members of the White House press corps.\n\n\"There have been a ton of headlines generated around Minneapolis, what's happening there, especially with the president changing his leadership there on the ground,\" Collins said on the air immediately after the event. \"That did not come up at all during this Cabinet meeting, and we were there for over an hour and a half.\"\n\n\"Not once was Minneapolis brought up, and obviously no questions were brought up to the president because he did not take questions, despite talking during the Cabinet meeting about how he believes they are the most transparent administration ever,\" she added.\n\nNoem and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino both came under fire for comments made shortly after Pretti's death on Jan. 24, in which they labeled the 37-year-old ICU nurse a \"domestic terrorist.\"\n\n\"This individual who came with weapons and ammunition to stop a law enforcement operation of federal law enforcement officers committed an act of domestic terrorism,\" Noem said while speaking with reporters just hours after Pretti was shot and killed. \"That’s the facts.\"\n\nVideo footage soon revealed that Pretti was holding a cell phone, not a gun, and that Border Patrol agents disarmed him before shooting him at point-blank range.\n\nCalls for Noem's impeachment have come from both Republicans and Democrats; however, when asked on Jan. 27 if Noem would be stepping down, Trump answered simply, telling reporters, \"No.\"\n\nHe has, however, sidelined Noem and Bovino from the operation in Minneapolis. In a Jan. 26 Truth Social post, Trump announced that he was sending his \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, to be his new point person on the ground in the embattled city.\n\n\"I am sending Tom Homan to Minnesota tonight,\" Trump, 79, wrote. \"He has not been involved in that area, but knows and likes many of the people there. Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me.\"\n\nThe following day, The Atlantic reported that Bovino will return to his Border Patrol post in El Centro, Calif., where he is Commander Op At Large of that sector.\n\nCBS News also reported on Jan. 27 that Noem is unlikely to lose her Cabinet position outright, but is expected to shift her focus away from Minneapolis to \"securing the southern border and other priorities.\"\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nOn Jan. 27, Axios reported that Noem was mounting a defense amid the growing scrutiny, reportedly placing the blame for any DHS missteps on Trump and his deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller.\n\n\"Everything I've done, I've done at the direction of the president and Stephen,\" Noem reportedly said, according to a person who relayed the quote to Axios.",

    "fullText": "Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Maine arrested an asylum-seeker and hauled him away, leaving behind his one-month-old baby and wife, who does not have a driver’s license.\n\nThe Portland Press Herald reported on Wednesday that on Jan. 21, Hassane Barry and his wife, Nene Barry, who are asylum-seekers from Guinea, were on their way home from an appointment to obtain a passport for their baby. But Hassane Barry never made it home, as his car was abruptly boxed in by four unmarked vehicles.\n\nThe Press Herald described the arrest:\n\nArmed and masked federal agents stepped out and said Hassane’s name. They were here for him.\n\n“There’s a baby in the car,” Barry told the agents. “There’s a baby.”\n\nAgents shattered his driver’s side window. Glass sprayed over the baby’s car seat, Nene Barry said. Her husband was arrested and pulled into an unmarked police car. Officers left the scene in a matter of minutes.\n\nNene Barry, who does not have a driver’s license and speaks little English, was left alone inside the car with her infant.\n\n“He did everything for us, and now he’s not here. What am I going to do alone with a 1-month-old baby in the cold?” Nene Barry said in an interview this week in French.\n\nVideo given to the Press Herald shows the aftermath of the incident. Shards of glass littered the street and the interior of the car. “I have a baby,” Nene Barry repeated in broken English.\n\n“There was a car seat in the back with one of those baby blankets you get at the hospital. There were broken glass shards all over it,” one witness told the paper, on condition of anonymity due to concerns for their safety. “I carefully pulled back the blanket and there was just this tiny peanut of a baby. He was crying.”\n\nHassane Barry, 38, has no known criminal record, his attorney said, and a search for a criminal history yielded no results. His English tutor told the Press Herald that Barry worked as a tow truck driver for AAA and worked as a ride-share driver on the side. At last check, Barry was being held at a detention facility in Plymouth, Massachusetts.\n\nNene Barry said she is afraid to leave her home, and has left just once, to bring her son to a medical appointment.\n\nThe arrest comes amid the Trump administration’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants, as well as immigrants who are in the country legally.\n\nLast week, an ICE agent in Portland went viral after he was filmed telling a woman that she was going into a “database” for “domestic terrorists” for daring to film him in public.\n\nThe post ICE Agents Shatter Car Window After Being Told ‘There’s a Baby’ Inside, Haul Asylum-Seeking Father Away first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "A Nicaraguan man who died at a troubled Texas detention camp days after he was detained by immigration agents in Minnesota appeared to have died by suicide, according to a 911 call and records released Wednesday.  Victor Manuel Diaz, 36, was found by guards on Jan. 14 in a room at Camp East Montana in El Paso, Texas, after he tried to die by suicide, a camp official reported on a 911 call obtained by The Associated Press through a public information request.  “They were doing rounds and they just found him with his pants tied up to his neck, I believe,” said the caller, who identified himself as a health administrator named Luis Gonzalez.",
    "fullText": "Victor Manuel Diaz, 36, was found by guards on Jan. 14 in a room at Camp East Montana in El Paso, Texas, after he tried to die by suicide, a camp official reported on a 911 call obtained by The Associated Press through a public information request.\n\n“They were doing rounds and they just found him with his pants tied up to his neck, I believe,” said the caller, who identified himself as a health administrator named Luis Gonzalez.\n\nDiaz’s death was at least the third of a detainee housed at Camp East Montana, which opened last year at Fort Bliss to hold 5,000 detainees in the desert near the U.S.-Mexico border. Advocates for detainees have alleged a pattern of violence, abuse and neglect at the camp. One earlier death has been ruled a homicide.\n\nRandall Kallinen, an attorney for Diaz's family, said they are suspicious of the claim that his death was a suicide because he was not depressed and would have been reunited with his mother, two sons and siblings in Nicaragua if he had been deported.\n\n“Even if it is suicide, was there something that happened to him that drove him to suicide?” Kallinen asked. “There still has to be an investigation.”\n\nMessages seeking comment were left with ICE on Wednesday.\n\nGonzalez did not witness Diaz's suicide attempt. A separate report by emergency medical services that was released Wednesday said Diaz was suspected of hanging himself with a bed sheet. Federal authorities have not released the findings of an autopsy, but have said the death was a “presumed suicide.”\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement picked up Diaz on Jan. 6 as agents fanned out across Minneapolis looking for people who may be in the country illegally. He was then sent to the sprawling Texas tent complex.\n\nDiaz crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in 2024, requested asylum and was released. A judge later ordered his removal after he didn’t show up for an immigration hearing, according to ICE.\n\nRelatives in Nicaragua lost contact with Diaz after he went to work at a suburban restaurant on Jan. 6 and later learned he'd been detained. They received a call on Jan. 15 from ICE saying Diaz was dead. Family members “were in disbelief,” said Carlos Morales, board president of Texas Nicaraguan Community, a nonprofit that helped the family raise money to repatriate Diaz's remains to Nicaragua.\n\nA coalition of groups and a Democratic congresswoman who represents El Paso have called for Camp East Montana to be closed.\n\nSome of those calls came after the Jan. 3 death of 55-year-old Cuba native Geraldo Lunas Campos. A medical examiner has ruled that a homicide, citing physical restraint by guards.\n\nA witness has described guards pinning Lunas Campos to the ground in handcuffs, with one restraining him in a chokehold until he could no longer breathe. ICE has said the guards intervened to try to help Lunas Campos after he attempted suicide, and that he resisted them. A camp official initially told police it was a suicide.\n\nLawyers for the family of Lunas Campos have asked a judge for an emergency order to prevent ICE from deporting detainees who witnessed the struggle.\n\nICE, which oversees the camp, announced Diaz’s death on Jan. 18, saying security staff “found Diaz unconscious and unresponsive in his room.” The agency said he “died of a presumed suicide” but that the cause was still under investigation.\n\nIn addition to Lunas Campos and Diaz, ICE announced that on Dec. 3 an immigrant from Guatemala held in Camp East Montana died after being transferred to a El Paso hospital for care. The agency said Francisco Gaspar-Andres, 48, was suspected to have died of liver and kidney failure.\n\nUnlike with the two prior deaths, Diaz’s body wasn’t sent to the county medical examiner in El Paso for an autopsy. Kallinen said an Armed Forces pathologist conducted the autopsy at Fort Bliss, and that he's been told it could take months for findings to be released.\n\nThe 911 caller in the case told the dispatcher that a team of doctors and nurses were working to try to revive Diaz after his suicide attempt and they needed an ambulance.\n\nParamedics found him laying on his back in a hospital bed without a heartbeat, according to an El Paso Fire Department incident report.\n\nAP reporter Michael Biesecker contributed from Washington.",

    "description": "Some small-business owners in Portland, Maine, are debating how best to support staff and customers amid a federal immigration crackdown.",
    "fullText": "After Andy Gerry and his business partners put a \"No ICE\" sign in the window of their lobster roll shop in Portland, Maine, backlash followed quickly.\n\nGerry said dozens of bad reviews flooded the restaurant last week after lists circulated online of area businesses that had hung \"No ICE\" posters following the federal government's announcement that it would increase immigration enforcement in the state.\n\nFor Gerry and his co-owners at The Highroller Lobster Co., it was one more challenge of running a small business.\n\n\"The posters are up, and they're not coming down,\" Gerry said.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with a half-dozen local business owners, including Gerry, about their decision to take a stance on immigration agents' presence in Portland, including whether to post signs.\n\nAlso on the table: Should they go along with calls for shutting businesses and schools on Friday as part of what organizers hope will be a nationwide campaign.\n\nGerry said that some owners he's been speaking with favor taking part in the stoppage, and others are calling for businesses to remain open to divert profits to groups helping immigrants.\n\nAlready this week, Gerry said, he's flip-flopped over whether to keep the restaurant open on Friday. His current thought: Close for the day and donate weekend proceeds to charities helping those affected by the immigration sweep.\n\nThese are the sorts of calculations that many small-business owners across the US have considered over the past few months. The question has felt especially urgent lately in Portland, a seaside city of about 70,000, where immigration officials have had a more visible presence over the past week.\n\nWhile some of corporate America's top executives have weighed in with statements about the immigration actions, some small-business owners — answering phones and facing customers directly — are making personal choices about whether to publicly take action.\n\nSome workers and owners at more than a dozen businesses Business Insider visited didn't want to discuss the immigration issue because they said it didn't pertain to their day-to-day operations. Others said they didn't want to upset neighboring businesses or draw attention.\n\nGerry said he saw putting up the sign, created by a Portland artist, as a way to amplify his staffers' voices and support anyone who might be fearful of getting caught up in the immigration sweep.\n\nHe said he contacted restaurant review sites to flag the negative ratings, and he and his co-owners instructed the restaurant's more than 50 staffers on how to handle negative phone calls. He shared with Business Insider screenshots of commenters encouraging people to \"review bomb\" the restaurant.\n\nEarlier this month, Eden Millecchia hung a \"No ICE\" poster in the window of her airy shop, called Flowers & Candy. The following week, she attended an online training conducted by a chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union about where federal agents are permitted to go within a business if they don't have a warrant.\n\nMillecchia said she feels she's in a more privileged position to speak up than some other shopkeepers.\n\n\"I'm the white lady who can yell,\" she said.\n\nYet, Millecchia said, motioning toward the poster, the sign is a \"hollow gesture\" — other than the show of support it sends.\n\nWhat is tangible, she said, is the drop in sales she's seen since word spread that immigration agents were focusing on Maine. For the long weekend that included Martin Luther King Day — which also included some unforgiving winter weather — her sales were down 91% year-over-year, Millecchia said.\n\n\"They killed my three-day weekend, and I think that it's going to keep people from coming here,\" she said, referring to the presence of federal officers.\n\nThat could mean fewer people will pick up the CBD products whose sales she relies on to help make rent. Another disruption: She plans to close on Friday to support the strike.\n\nAn ICE spokesperson told Business Insider that it doesn't comment on immigration enforcement operations. US Customs and Border Protection didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn the steps outside Arcana Maine, a shop that sits opposite a small park and sells jewelry and works by area artists, a circular table recently displayed free business-card-sized guides to rights enshrined in the Constitution. The cards were printed in English, Spanish, French, Arabic, Somali, and Kinyarwanda, which is spoken in parts of Africa.\n\nAn employee named Nico, who declined to give his last name, said that giving the cards a prominent spot was a way to help the community.\n\nHe estimated that foot traffic at the store had fallen by at least half from what's typical for January.\n\nAt a skate shop called Mocean, owner Jasper Tripp said he hung a \"No ICE\" sign because it aligned with his beliefs. Ordinarily, he said, he tries to separate his political views from the store he has run for nearly a decade.\n\n\"It just feels right,\" Tripp said of the decision to put up the poster. He worked with an artist to design an anti-ICE T-shirt. Proceeds from its sale will go to charities supporting immigrants' legal expenses, he said.\n\nFor some business owners, concerns go beyond the risk of alienating customers. One restaurant owner said she plans to shut down for at least a week — and pay workers — while she's out of town. Ordinarily, she said, her employees would run the restaurant, which has an entirely Spanish-speaking staff.\n\nShe asked that Business Insider not use her name or that of her restaurant to protect her employees, who she said are legal immigrants but who nevertheless feel threatened.\n\nShe taped a \"No ICE\" poster to the door to help employees and customers to feel safe, not to denounce immigration agents, she said.\n\nThe balance is tricky, the owner added. \"I have the responsibility to keep people safe. I also have an economic responsibility.\"",

    "fullText": "Related video: Governor Spencer Cox spoke gave a State of the State address.\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (ABC4) — On Tuesday, Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall delivered the State of the City address. She highlighted priorities of civic development, public safety, and affordable housing.\n\nAt the beginning of the address, the Red Spirit Singers of the Uintah Tribe offered a presentation. Then, the CEO of the 2034 Olympics spoke about the city’s preparations for the upcoming Games and stated that Mendenhall has been instrumental in bringing the Games back to Utah.\n\nHe added that the games will bring a possibility of unity throughout the state, and all residents will be able to be involved in the community to bring the Olympic spirit locally.\n\nHow to make ABC4 your preferred news source on Google\n\nDuring her speech, Mendenhall highlighted several of her priorities and the issues facing her constituents and the city. One thing she spoke on was the 2025 safety plan recommendation, and she says they have completed over half of the outlined solutions and are now working on implementing the long-term solutions.\n\nMendenhall also noted the city completed the voter streets bond, resurfaced and replaced hundreds of miles of roads, and finished phase one of Glendale Park.\n\n“The next chapter of our city’s story and our state’s and our nation’s is not waiting to be written. We’re writing it now, and in doing so, we will not stand still. We will not slow our commitments, and we will not govern for comfort when the moment calls for resolve,” Mendenhall said.\n\nShe emphasized that the state of the city will be determined by what comes next, not by what they have already done.\n\nMendenhall partially addressed issues of public safety and brought up an ongoing controversy surrounding a proposed immigration detention center in Salt Lake City. Members of the community protested the center, and Mendenhall stated that she sent a letter to the owners, stating that the city code prevents a large-scale housing center at the warehouse’s location in its current form. The warehouse’s owners stated in a press release on Saturday that they had no intent to sell or lease the property.\n\nOwners and investors of warehouse rumored to be used as ICE facility say they have ‘no plans to sell’ to the federal government\n\nMendenhall also spoke on national issues with immigration, including controversy after two people were shot and killed by ICE officers in Minneapolis.\n\n“I want to make it clear that I am prepared to use every tool under my control to protect the values of Salt Lake City and the dignity of every one of our residents,” Mendenhall said. “To this end, we have introduced the Future Citizens Path program to support eligible green card holders in Salt Lake City through the U.S. Citizenship process.”\n\nShe also addressed homelessness issues within the city and spoke on Project Connect, which targeted individuals with high arrest rates and connected them with social workers. 60% of those individuals reduced the frequency of arrests, and Mendenhall says they hope to expand this program in 2026.\n\nTen bills to keep an eye on during the 2026 General Legislative Session\n\nIn addition to reducing crime rates in homeless communities, Mendenhall stated that Salt Lake City will launch a program to invest in repairs to existing affordable housing and help renters become homeowners.\n\nAdditionally, Mendenhall mentioned that ongoing efforts would add more community centers throughout Salt Lake City, involving residents in each area. To this end, she shared planned designs for Salt Lake City’s civic center.\n\n“We owe it to those who came before us to protect those seeking a better life to ensure those who arrive are not persecuted for their beliefs like so many of Utah’s first pioneers, but that they are embraced,” Mayor Mendenhall said, concluding her speech. “That they are welcomed. That they may become a part of our strong community.”\n\nIncreased police presence at University of Utah after bomb threat reported\n\nFlorida man sentenced to prison on charges connected with South Jordan 15-year-old who disappeared for a month\n\nHouse committee hears bill created to address electric-assisted bicycle (e-bike) safety concerns\n\nHouse Republicans warn against Senate changing DHS funding bill\n\nThis is The Place Heritage Park is the spot for weddings, reunions, and big days",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Two federal officers fired shots during the encounter that killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti over the weekend in Minneapolis, a Customs and Border Protection official told Congress in a notice sent Tuesday, while Ecuador’s minister of foreign affairs filed an objection saying immigration agents tried to enter the country's consulate in the city without permission.\n\nOfficers tried to take Pretti into custody and he resisted, leading to a struggle, according to a notification to Congress obtained by The Associated Press. During the struggle, a Border Patrol agent yelled, “He’s got a gun!” multiple times, the official said.\n\nA Border Patrol officer and a CBP officer each fired Glock pistols, the notice said.\n\nInvestigators from CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility conducted the analysis based on a review of body-worn camera footage and agency documentation, the notice said. The law requires the agency to inform relevant congressional committees about deaths in CBP custody within 72 hours.\n\nSeparately, a man was arrested after he sprayed an unknown liquid at U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar while she was speaking at a town hall meeting in Minneapolis. The Democrat had just called for the abolishment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to resign when she was sprayed.\n\nTrump says 'we're going to de-escalate a little bit'\n\nThe developments came a day after President Donald Trump ordered border czar Tom Homan to take over his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota in the wake of Pretti's death, which was the second fatal shooting this month of a person at the hands of immigration law enforcement.\n\nThe president added of Homan, “Tom, as tough as he is, gets along” with governors and mayors, even in Democratic areas.\n\nAs he left the White House on Tuesday, the president was asked whether Pretti’s killing was justified. He responded by saying that a “big investigation” was underway. In the hours after Pretti’s death, some administration officials sought to blame the shooting on the 37-year-old intensive care nurse.\n\nStephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff who had initially called Pretti “an assassin,” issued a statement suggesting CBP officers in Minneapolis “may not have been following” protocol. He said the Homeland Security Department’s initial statements about what transpired on Saturday was “based on reports from CBP on the ground.”\n\nEcuador files a protest with the US Embassy\n\nA video of the Ecuadorian consulate entry attempt posted on social media shows a staffer running to the door to turn the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents away, telling them, “This is the Ecuadorian consulate. You’re not allowed to enter.” One ICE officer can be heard responding by threatening to “grab” the staffer if he touched the agent before agreeing to leave.\n\nInternational law generally prohibits law enforcement authorities from entering foreign consulates or embassies without permission, though sometimes permission may be assumed granted for life-threatening emergencies, like fires.\n\n“Consulate officials immediately prevented the ICE officer from entering the consular building, thus ensuring the protection of the Ecuadorians who were present at the time and activating the emergency protocols issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility,” the ministry wrote on X.\n\nA “note of protest” was filed with the U.S. Embassy in Ecuador so that similar attempts aren’t made at other consulates, the ministry said. The State Department, Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nTrump says of sending Bovino to Minneapolis: ‘Maybe it wasn’t good here’\n\nImmigration enforcement activity witnessed by journalists in Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs on Tuesday appeared comparable with recent weeks. As before, most didn’t result in major confrontations with agents. Activists say they continue to monitor enforcement operations through social media and chats on messaging apps.\n\nThe White House had tried to blame Democratic leaders for the protests of immigration raids. But after Pretti’s killing and videos suggesting he was not an active threat, the administration tapped Homan to take charge of the Minnesota operation from Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino.\n\nTrump said Bovino, the go-to architect for the president’s large-scale city-by-city immigration crackdowns, was “very good” but added “he’s a pretty out-there kind of a guy” and “maybe it wasn’t good here.”\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, along with the city's police chief, met with Homan on Tuesday and agreed to keep talking. Homan posted on social media that the discussions “were a productive starting point.”\n\nCourts weigh in on detained immigrants\n\nIn Texas, a federal judge issued a temporary order prohibiting the removal of a 5-year-old Ecuadorian boy and his father who were detained last week in Minnesota in an incident that further inflamed divisions on immigration. U.S. Judge Fred Biery ruled Monday that any removal or transfer of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, is on hold while a court case proceeds.\n\nAlso in Texas, federal immigration authorities released an Ecuadorian man whose detention led the chief federal judge in Minnesota to order the head of ICE to appear in his courtroom, the man's attorney said.\n\nAttorney Graham Ojala-Barbour said the man was released in Texas. The lawyer said in an email to The Associated Press that he was notified in an email from the U.S. attorneys office in Minneapolis that his client had been freed.\n\nIn an order dated Monday, Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz expressed frustration with the Trump administration’s handling of immigration cases. He took the extraordinary step of ordering Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, to personally appear in his courtroom Friday.\n\nSchiltz had said in his order that he would cancel Lyons’ appearance if the man was released from custody.\n\n“This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result,” he wrote.\n\nSchiltz's order followed a federal court hearing Monday on a request by the state and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul for a judge to halt the immigration enforcement surge. The judge in that case said she would prioritize the ruling but did not give a timeline for a decision.\n\nSchiltz wrote that he recognizes ordering the head of a federal agency to appear personally is extraordinary. “But the extent of ICE’s violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed,” he said.\n\nThe Associated Press left messages Tuesday with ICE and a DHS spokesperson seeking a response.\n\nCatalini reported from Trenton, New Jersey and Karnowski from Minneapolis. Associated Press writers Tim Sullivan in Minneapolis, Rebecca Boone in Boise, Idaho, and Michelle Price in Washington contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents attempted to enter the Ecuadorian consulate in Minneapolis on Tuesday, prompting the country’s minister of foreign affairs to file a protest with the U.S. Embassy in Ecuador.\n\nA video of the incident was posted online. It shows staff inside the consulate rushing to the door to prevent the agents from entering. “Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!” one man exclaimed. “This is the Ecuadorian consulate. You’re not allowed to enter.”\n\nEcuador’s foreign ministry issued a statement in Spanish about the incident. The following is an English translation of the statement:\n\nREGARDING THE ATTEMPTED INCURSION INTO THE ECUADORIAN CONSULATE IN MINNEAPOLIS BY ICE AGENTS\n\nThis morning, the Ecuadorian Consul in Minneapolis reported that, at approximately 11:00 a.m., an agent from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) attempted to enter the Consulate premises.\n\nConsulate officials immediately prevented the ICE officer from entering the consular office, thus guaranteeing the protection of the Ecuadorian citizens who were present at the consulate at that time and activating the emergency protocols issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility.\n\nTherefore, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic immediately submitted a letter of protest to the United States Embassy in Ecuador to ensure that acts of this nature are not repeated at any of Ecuador’s consular offices in the United States.\n\nGenerally speaking, officials from host countries need permission from consular staff to enter the premises. The Vienna Convention on Consular Relations – to which the U.S. is a party – states, “The authorities of the receiving State shall not enter that part of the consular premises which is used exclusively for the purpose of the work of the consular post except with the consent of the head of the consular post or of his designee or of the head of the diplomatic mission of the sending State.”\n\nICE and Border Patrol agents have swarmed the Twin Cities area in recent weeks as part of the Trump administration’s ongoing crackdown. On Saturday, Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis shot and killed Alex Pretti, who had been filming their activities in public. Earlier this month in the city, ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Good as she attempted to drive away from agents.\n\nThe post ICE Agents Try To Enter Ecuadorian Consulate in Minneapolis first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Mobile Fortify app being used to scan faces of citizens and immigrants – but its use has prompted a severe backlash\n\nImmigration enforcement agents across the US are increasingly relying on a new smartphone app with facial recognition technology.\n\nThe app is named Mobile Fortify. Simply pointing a phone’s camera at their intended target and scanning the person’s face allows Mobile Fortify to pull data on an individual from multiple federal and state databases, some of which federal courts have deemed too inaccurate for arrest warrants.\n\nThe US Department of Homeland Security has used Mobile Fortify to scan faces and fingerprints in the field more than 100,000 times, according to a lawsuit brought by Illinois and Chicago against the federal agency, earlier this month. That’s a drastic shift from immigration enforcement’s earlier use of facial recognition technology, which was otherwise limited largely to investigations and ports of entry and exit, legal experts say.\n\nThe app’s existence was first uncovered last summer by 404 Media, through leaked emails. 404 Media also reported, in October, about internal DHS documents that say people cannot refuse to be scanned by Mobile Fortify.\n\n“Here we have ICE using this technology in exactly the confluence of conditions that lead to the highest false match rates,” says Nathan Freed Wessler, deputy director of the ACLU’s speech, privacy and technology project. “A false result from this technology can turn somebody’s life totally upside down.” The larger implications for democracy are chilling, too, he notes: “ICE is effectively trying to create a biometric checkpoint society.”\n\nUse of the app has inspired backlash on the streets, in courts, and on Capitol Hill.\n\nProtesters are using a variety of tactics to fight back. They include recording masked agents, using burner phones and donated dashboard cameras, according to the Washington Post.\n\nUnderpinning resistance to ICE’s use of facial recognition are doubts about the technology’s efficacy. Research has uncovered higher error rates in identifying women and people of color than for scans of white faces. ICE’s use of the technology is often occurring in intense and fast-moving situations, which makes misidentification more likely. Those being scanned may be people of color. They could be turning away from officers because they don’t want to be identified. The lighting could be poor.\n\nThe Illinois lawsuit against the DHS takes particular issue with the federal agency’s use of Mobile Fortify and argued that the app goes far beyond what Congress allows with regards to the collection of biometric data. The complaint cited several examples in which federal agents appeared to take photos or scans of US citizens across Illinois without their consent.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers in Congress introduced a bill on 15 January that would outright ban the homeland security department from using Mobile Fortify or similar apps, except for identification at points of entry. This follows a September letter, sent by senators to ICE, asking \n\nThe DHS said in a statement that Mobile Fortify does not violate constitutional rights or compromise privacy. “It operates with a deliberately high matching threshold and queries only limited CBP immigration datasets. The application does not access open-source material, scrape social media, or rely on publicly available data,” a spokesperson said.\n\nAccording to 404 Media, the app’s database consists of some 200m images. “Mobile Fortify has not been blocked, restricted, or curtailed by the courts or by legal guidance. It is lawfully used nationwide in accordance with all applicable legal authorities.”\n\nObservers, experts, and at least one congressman have said federal immigration agents frequently do not ask for consent to scan a person’s face – and may dismiss other documentation that contradicts this data. ICE has been documented using biometrics as a definitive determination of someone’s citizenship in the absence of identification.\n\nThis means that ICE is not required to conduct additional vetting of facial scans or checks to avoid a misidentification. 404 Media reported earlier this month that Mobile Fortify misidentified a detained woman during an immigration raid; the app came up with two different and incorrect names.\n\n“Facial recognition – to the extent it should be used at all – is really supposed to be a starting point,” says Jake Laperruque, deputy director of the security and surveillance project at the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT). “If you treat this as an endpoint – as a definitive ID – you’re going to have errors, and you’re going to end up arresting and jailing people that are not actually who the machine says it is.”\n\nLaperruque says that even police departments across the country have pushed back against an over-reliance on facial recognition, treating it as a lead, at most. At least 15 states are cautious about using it all, and have laws limiting police’s use of the technology. In 2019, San Francisco became the first major US city to ban facial recognition technology by police and all other local government agencies.\n\nThe DHS issued a directive in September 2023 requiring that the bureau test the technology for unintended bias and offer US citizens the choice to opt out of scans not conducted by law enforcement. That directive appeared to be rescinded in February last year.\n\nICE’s stops – whether they involve face-scanning or not – have been subject to litigation as well. They have often been referred to as “Kavanaugh stops” after the supreme court justice wrote in a concurring opinion that Hispanic residents’ “apparent ethnicity” can be a “relevant factor” for ICE to stop them and demand for proof of citizenship. The ACLU sued the Trump administration earlier this month, accusing federal immigration authorities of racial profiling and unlawful arrests.",

    "fullText": "Ray Dalio says a second killing by immigration officers in Minneapolis this month has put America on the verge of civil war.\n\n\"The United States is now a tinderbox,\" the billionaire investor wrote in an essay published Monday on X.\n\nHe said the federal government's clash with authorities in Minnesota and other states is \"bad and likely to get worse\" after Border Patrol agents shot and killed Alex Pretti on Saturday. Renee Good was killed in a confrontation with ICE agents on January 7.\n\nDalio — the founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the world's largest hedge funds — said that if President Donald Trump doesn't back down, it would \"risk pushing us over the brink into a more clear civil war.\"\n\nThe US leader could prevent further escalation by appealing for peace, showing the justice system will deal with the shootings fairly, and reining in his immigration enforcement, Dalio said.\n\nThe path Trump chooses \"will have huge implications for what comes next, including possibly lighting the tinderbox,\" he added.\n\nTrump has pivoted to a more conciliatory tone since the weekend. In a Monday post on Truth Social, the president said he had a \"very good call\" with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and the pair were on a \"similar wavelength\" on how to proceed with immigration enforcement in his state.\n\n\"Nobody in the White House, including President Trump, wants to see people getting hurt or killed in America's streets,\" Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said.\n\nDalio is one of scores of business leaders to speak out about the situation in Minneapolis. Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian urged US leaders in a X post to \"lead right now — deescalate,\" while philanthropist Melinda French Gates wrote on the platform that there's \"nothing more American than exercising our rights and holding our government accountable.\"\n\nDalio, the author of \"Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order,\" said the conflicts raging in the US today echo the decline of past superpowers. He said it was \"like watching a movie that I have seen many times in history.\"\n\nHe drew a parallel to a passage from his book: \"When broad-based discontent bubbles up and those in power allow it to grow, it can boil over to the point that when they try to put a lid on it, it explodes.\"\n\nDalio said on X that \"people dying in the fighting\" and \"conflicts between the states and the central government over their relative powers\" are two classic markers of the move into the \"more violent civil war stage,\" which often heralds the collapse of the \"monetary, domestic political, and international geopolitical orders.\"\n\nThe Wall Street titan and economic-history guru has been ringing the alarm on the crumbling of the current world order for several years now. In 2021, he pegged the probability of a US civil war within the next 10 years at 30%.\n\nHe has also decried the national debt of over $38 trillion, comparing it to an \"aggressive cancer\" and \"being on a boat headed to rocks.\"\n\nDalio wrote on X that the US needs to exercise greater \"financial discipline\" to protect its central role in the current monetary order, and resume abiding by the rules to allow disagreements to be resolved peacefully and democracy to function.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is headed to Iowa on Tuesday as part of the White House’s midterm-year pivot toward affordability, even as his administration remains mired in fallout over a second fatal shooting by federal immigration officers in in Minneapolis.\n\nIn a display of reducing tensions, Trump said he had “great calls” with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Jacob Frey on Monday, after federal immigration officers killed a protester for the second time in two weeks. Trump’s sudden shift toward a more conciliatory approach is just the latest in a string of moments where he's taken maximalist positions, only to appear to retreat.\n\nThe Trump White House has tried to blame Democratic leaders for the protests. But after videos suggest his administration wrongly labeled ICU nurse Alex Pretti an active threat to the ICE agents who shot him, the administration is trying to recalibrate its crackdown, putting White House border czar Tom Homan in charge of its Minnesota immigration operations among other moves and announcing that Greg Bovino was leaving the city.\n\nThe chief federal judge in Minnesota, meanwhile, ordered Todd Lyons, the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to appear before him Friday to explain why he shouldn’t be held in contempt for Trump administration failures to hold hearings for detained immigrants.\n\nTrump disputes staff and says slain Alex Pretti was not an ‘assassin’\n\nTrump was asked if the killed Minneapolis protester was an “assassin” as a key aide has claimed and the president answered “no.”\n\nThe president added, however, that protesters “can’t have guns” as Pretti did and “it’s just a very unfortunate incident.” Trump has said he wants the death investigated.\n\nOn Saturday, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller on social media described Pretti as an “assassin” who “tried to murder federal agents.” Vice President JD Vance shared the post on X as well.\n\nTrump says he’s going to be ‘watching over’ investigation into Pretti’s killing, which he calls ‘very sad’\n\nThe president was asked as he left the White House on Tuesday whether he thought Pretti’s killing was justified and he responded by saying that a “big investigation” was underway.\n\n“I want to see the investigation. I’m going to be watching over it, and I want a very honorable and honest investigation. I have to see it myself,” he said.\n\nHe was also asked about Pretti’s family and said in response, he said: “I love everybody. I love all of our people. I love his family. And it’s a very sad situation.”\n\nTrump says Noem isn’t going to resign\n\nAsked by reporters as he left the White House on Tuesday for a trip to Iowa whether Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is going to step down, Trump had a one-word answer: “No.”\n\nDemocrats in Congress have called for Noem’s exit after federal agents fatally shot two people in Minneapolis protesting immigration enforcement actions.\n\nTrump sent his border czar Tom Homan to Minneapolis and said on Tuesday that Homan was meeting with both the mayor and Minnesota governor.\n\nMinnesota resident says ‘world-changing events’ so close to home have been ‘overwhelming’\n\nChristina Leeson, who lives in the Minneapolis suburb Edina and was at Pretti’s vigil Tuesday morning, said Bovino’s leave is encouraging, though she’s hesitant to believe things are over since Tom Homan is coming in.\n\n“It’s just overwhelming, the amount of world-changing events that have happened within a 3-mile radius,” she said, referring to the death of Renee Good earlier in January, and George Floyd in 2020.\n\n“I feel like this is usually the time of year where I think we all kind of question why we live in Minnesota when it’s, you now, negative zero or below zero for weeks on end,” she said.\n\nLeeson said the way the community has come together in recent weeks has been a reminder of “the community, and how much we care for our neighbors and look out for each other, and are going to come out, and stand for what we believe is right no matter what.”\n\nWalz has made his priorities clear to Homan, governor’s office says\n\n“Governor Walz met with Tom Homan this morning and reiterated Minnesota’s priorities: impartial investigations into the Minneapolis shootings involving federal agents, a swift, significant reduction in the number of federal forces in Minnesota, and an end to the campaign of retribution against Minnesota,” the governor’s office announced.\n\n“The Governor and Homan agreed on the need for an ongoing dialogue and will continue working toward those goals, which the President also agreed to yesterday. The Governor tasked the Minnesota Department of Public Safety as the primary liaison to Homan to ensure these goals are met,” the statement said.\n\nImmigration agents still active across the Twin Cities\n\nIf they’ve changed tactics with the shift in tone from the White House, it wasn’t immediately clear in the Minneapolis and St. Paul area.\n\nThe streets appeared largely quiet Tuesday morning in South Minneapolis neighborhoods where unmarked convoys of immigration agents have been regular sights in recent weeks, including the neighborhoods where two people were killed by federal agents.\n\nBut Associated Press staff saw carloads of agents in northeast Minneapolis and in the suburb of Little Canada.\n\nEvery living former Democratic president has now addressed Pretti’s killing\n\nFormer President Joe Biden said on social media on Tuesday that the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis “betrays our most basic values as Americans.”\n\nFormer President Barack Obama said Sunday that the killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti by a U.S. Border Patrol officer should be a “wake-up call to every American” and warned that “our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault.”\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton’s statement Sunday said that “over the course of a lifetime, we face only a few moments where the decisions we make and the actions we take will shape our history for years to come.”\n\n“This is one of them,” Clinton said. “If we give our freedoms away after 250 years, we might never get them back.”\n\nCivil rights leaders to meet with Minnesota attorney general\n\nNAACP president Derrick Johnson and League of United Latin American Citizens president Roman Palomares will hold community events in Minneapolis on Tuesday before meeting with Ellison.\n\nThe events include a visit to the site where Alex Pretti was shot and killed by federal immigration officers for a “moment of reflection,” according to a press release from LULAC, and a “Community Conversation” held at NAACP’s Minneapolis headquarters.\n\nTrump immigration crackdown contributes to drop in US population growth rate\n\nTrump’s crackdown on immigration contributed to a year-to-year drop in the nation’s growth rate as the U.S. population reached nearly 342 million people in 2025, according to population estimates released Tuesday by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe 0.5% growth rate was a sharp drop from 2024’s immigration-fueled rate of almost 1%, which grew the population to an estimated 340 million.\n\nBirths outnumbered deaths last year by 519,000 people last year and 1.3 million people immigrated, compared with 2.8 million immigrants in 2024.\n\nIn the past 125 years, the lowest growth rate was during the coronavirus pandemic, when the population grew by just 0.16% in 2021. Before that, the lowest rate was just under 0.5% in 1919 during the Spanish flu.\n\n▶ Read more about how Trump policies are affecting U.S. population numbers\n\nMinnesota attorney general wants more than talk from Trump administration\n\nKeith Ellison said he hopes Trump’s “Operation Metro Surge” will end immediately. Asked on MS NOW’s “Morning Joe” Tuesday if Trump’s newly conciliatory posture has led to more federal cooperation with state and local officials in Minneapolis, Ellison said “not that I’ve seen so far.”\n\n“You should understand, Minnesota is abiding by the law as written. We, under the 10th Amendment, the federal government doesn’t have the authority to convert us into its deputies,” Ellison said. “And what the federal government has done is said, ‘well, if you don’t do it our way, we’re going to saturate your state with 4,000 ICE agents until you cry uncle and obey.’ And that’s unconstitutional and illegal.”\n\n“It’s a good thing” Trump talked with Minnesota’s governor and Minneapolis’ mayor, Ellison said. “But we need to see some results ... they’ve got to show, not just say.”\n\nBrandi Carlile donating to defense of Minnesota ICE detainees\n\nDescribing herself as “heartbroken and angry for Minnesota,” the singer-songwriter says her foundation will grant $25,000 to a Minnesota organization that provides legal defense to people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n“Over the past month, the community there has continued to set an incredible example for the rest of us, demonstrating the power of uniting to protect our neighbors and defend what is right,” she posted on Instagram Monday. “Now, more than ever, it is vital that we continue to hold each other and take action to stop the hate that is spreading through our country.”\n\nCarlile said the Looking Out Foundation is granting the money to help The Advocates for Human Rights provide free legal assistance to detainees.\n\nFetterman calls on Trump to fire Noem\n\nPennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman is calling on Trump to fire Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem after federal agents fatally shot two protesters in Minneapolis.\n\n“Americans have died,” Fetterman said in a direct appeal to Trump. “She is betraying DHS’s core mission and trashing your border security legacy.”\n\nFetterman, a Democrat who has increasingly voted with Republicans, said Trump should “NOT make the mistake President Biden made for not firing a grossly incompetent DHS Secretary.”\n\nFetterman voted with Democrats in April 2024 to dismiss a trial against Biden’s Homeland Security Secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, after he was impeached by the Republican-led House.\n\nWhat to know about Gregory Bovino\n\nThe field commander of Trump’s immigration crackdown in Minneapolis is leaving the city after federal agents fatally shot two people.\n\nBovino had been the go-to architect for the large-scale immigration crackdowns ordered by Trump and the public face of his administration’s city-by-city sweeps. The Border Patrol chief led agents in Los Angeles, Chicago and New Orleans before he headed to Minnesota in December for what the Department of Homeland Security called its largest-ever immigration enforcement operation.\n\n“We’re going to turn and burn to that next target and the next and the next and the next, and we’re not going to stop,” Bovino said in an interview.\n\n▶ Read more about Bovino’s career, methods and approach\n\nMelania Trump, on morning show, calls for unity\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump said in a Fox News interview Tuesday that Americans needed to come together as protests continue in Minneapolis.\n\n“I’m against the violence. So, if — please, if you protest, protest in peace. And we need to unify in these times,” she said.\n\nMelania Trump’s comments went beyond her husband’s in calling for calm, though he has softened his rhetoric in recent days while continuing to blame Democrats for the violence.\n\nShe also echoed the president’s previous statements that he had a “great call” Monday with Walz and Frey, adding they were working together to ensure protests were “without riots.”\n\nThe interview with Ainsley Earnhardt on “Fox & Friends” was pegged to the upcoming release of a new documentary about the first lady.\n\nThis item has been corrected. Melania Trump said “if you protest,” not “if we protest.”\n\nTrump says his calls with Minnesota Democratic leaders were ‘great’\n\nIn a display of reducing tensions, Trump said in a radio interview broadcast Tuesday that he had “great calls” with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Jacob Frey on Monday, after federal immigration officers killed a protester for the second time in two weeks.\n\nThe Trump White House has tried to blame Democratic leaders for the protests. But after videos suggest his administration wrongly labeled Alex Pretti an active threat to ICE agents, the administration is trying to recalibrate its crackdown, putting White House border czar Tom Homan in charge of its Minnesota immigration operations among other moves.\n\n“Actually, they were both great conversations,” the president said on the show “Sid & Friends In The Morning” on 77 WABC in New York City. “So let’s hope that turns out to be so.”\n\nICE chief must appear in court to explain why detainees have been denied due process\n\nThe chief federal judge in Minnesota says the Trump administration has failed to comply with orders to hold hearings for detained immigrants. He’s ordered Todd Lyons, Trump’s acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to appear before him Friday to explain why he shouldn’t be held in contempt.\n\n“This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result,” Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz wrote in the order dated Monday.\n\nMessages were sent Tuesday to ICE and a DHS spokesperson seeking a response.\n\nICE agents will have a security role at Milan Cortina Olympics\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents will have a security role during the upcoming Milan Cortina Winter Games, according to information shared with local media by sources at the U.S. Embassy in Rome. The Associated Press independently confirmed the information with two sources at the embassy.\n\nThe sources who confirmed ICE participation on Tuesday said that federal ICE agents would support diplomatic security details and would not run any immigration enforcement operations.\n\nDuring previous Olympics, several federal agencies have supported security for U.S. diplomats, including the investigative component of ICE called Homeland Security Investigations, the sources said. They could not be named because they are not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nMilan Mayor Giuseppe Sala said that ICE would not be welcome in his city, which is hosting most ice sports during the Feb. 6-22 Winter Games.\n\n▶ Read more about the ICE agents' planned role in Milan\n\n—- By Trisha Thomas and David Biller\n\nBovino is set to leave Minneapolis as Trump reshuffles the leadership of his immigration crackdown\n\nBorder Patrol commander Gregory Bovino is expected to leave Minneapolis on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the matter, as the Trump administration reshuffles leadership of its immigration enforcement operation and scales back the federal presence after a second fatal shooting by federal officers.\n\nTrump said he was placing his border czar, Tom Homan, in charge of the mission, with Homan reporting directly to the White House, after Bovino drew condemnation for claiming the man who was killed, Alex Pretti, had been planning to “massacre” law enforcement officers, a characterization that authorities had not substantiated.\n\nBovino’s leadership of highly visible federal crackdowns, including operations that sparked mass demonstrations in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and Minneapolis, has drawn fierce criticism from local officials, civil rights advocates and congressional Democrats.\n\nA person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press that Bovino is among the federal agents leaving Minneapolis. The person was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the operation and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.\n\n▶ Read more about Trump's ICE enforcement leadership reshuffle\n\nTrump administration’s trust and credibility tested in wake of Pretti’s death in Minneapolis\n\nTrust is one of a president’s most valuable currencies, especially in a time of crisis. During his second term, Trump has persistently undermined the trust and credibility of major universities, national law firms and media and taken punitive actions against them. His supporters largely either endorsed those actions or stayed mum.\n\nNow the credibility question is aimed at his administration. While the criticism is not directly aimed at the president by his supporters, it is a sign that trust is eroding over some of his most important policies.\n\nThe White House seemed to try to ease the conflict Monday. Trump and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz spoke and both suggested their conversation was productive. Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino, who has been at the center of the administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement surge nationwide, is expected to soon leave Minneapolis.\n\nStill, lawmakers from both parties — including many Republicans — called for independent investigations and, perhaps most importantly, trust after administration officials gave one account of the shooting in Minneapolis, while contemporaneous video provided a decidedly different one.\n\n▶ Read more about how Trump's credibility is increasingly being questioned\n\nTrump will visit Iowa in a bid to focus on affordability during fallout from Minneapolis shooting\n\nTrump is headed to Iowa on Tuesday as part of the White House’s midterm-year pivot toward affordability while his administration remains mired in the fallout in Minneapolis over a second fatal shooting by federal immigration officers this month. Even as some top administration officials moved quickly to malign Alex Pretti, the White House said Monday that Trump was waiting until an investigation into the shooting was complete.\n\nWhile in Iowa, the Republican president will make a stop at a local business and then deliver a speech on affordability, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. The remarks will be at the Horizon Events Center in Clive, a suburb of Des Moines.\n\nThe trip will also highlight energy policy, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said last week. It’s part of the White House’s strategy to have Trump travel out of Washington once a week ahead of the midterm elections to focus on affordability issues facing everyday Americans — an effort that keeps getting diverted by crisis.\n\nMinnesota killing produces backlash against Trump administration from Second Amendment advocates\n\nProminent Republicans and gun rights advocates helped elicit a White House turnabout this week after bristling over the administration’s characterization of Alex Prettibas responsible for his own death because he lawfully possessed a weapon.\n\nThe death produced no clear shifts in U.S. gun politics or policies, even Trump shuffles the lieutenants in charge of his militarized immigration crackdown. But important voices in Trump’s coalition have called for a thorough investigation of Pretti’s death while also criticizing inconsistencies in some Republicans’ Second Amendment stances.\n\nIf the dynamic persists, it could give Republicans problems as Trump heads into a midterm election year with voters already growing skeptical of his overall immigration approach. The concern is acute enough that Trump’s top spokeswoman sought Monday to reassert his brand as a staunch gun rights supporter.\n\n“The president supports the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding American citizens, absolutely,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.\n\nLeavitt qualified that “when you are bearing arms and confronted by law enforcement, you are raising … the risk of force being used against you.”\n\n▶ Read more about the backlash among gun rights advocates",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The fatal shooting of a Minneapolis protester by a federal immigration officer touched off a fierce national debate and prompted some fellow Republicans to question President Donald Trump's hard-line immigration crackdown, but the president on Sunday night continued to blame Democratic officials.\n\nAfter remaining relatively quiet on Sunday, the Republican president in two lengthy social media posts said that Democrats had encouraged people to obstruct law enforcement operations. He also called on officials in Minnesota to work with immigration officers and \"turn over\" people who were in the U.S. illegally.\n\n“Tragically, two American Citizens have lost their lives as a result of this Democrat ensued chaos,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social media network.\n\nTrump's refusal to back away from his pledge to carry out the largest deportation program in history and the surge of immigration officers to heavily Democratic cities came as more Republicans began calling for a deeper investigation and expressing unease with some of the administration's tactics.\n\nTrump also told The Wall Street Journal in an interview Sunday that his administration was “reviewing everything,” but he refused to say whether the officer who shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti acted appropriately.\n\n“We’re looking, we’re reviewing everything and will come out with a determination,” Trump said.\n\nThe White House did not answer questions about whether Trump watched the videos of the shooting in Minnesota, which seemed to contradict the account of what happened by members of his administration, or whether he planned to speak to Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who had appealed to the president to help bring calm to the city.\n\nInstead, Trump on Sunday night said he would call on Congress to pass legislation banning so-called sanctuary cities. His administration has sought to apply the label to communities based on their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts, among other factors.\n\nHis push for action by lawmakers comes even as outrage over the shooting has raised the possibility of a partial government shutdown in a week because of a standoff over additional funding for immigration enforcement.\n\nTrump's initial reaction to the shooting of Pretti came hours after it took place on Saturday. In a post on his Truth Social network, he questioned why Pretti had a firearm and accused Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey of inciting \"Insurrection, with their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric.”\n\nBut throughout the weekend, Trump, who rarely lets a major moment go without comment, did not make any public appearances or express any dismay over Pretti's death.\n\nInstead, he posted online complaining about Canada and efforts to stop him from building an expansive ballroom at the White House, calling a lawsuit to block its construction “devastating to the White House, our Country, and all concerned.”\n\nHe also posted messages praising U.K. troops after his comments about them earlier in the week were widely interpreted as a grave insult and praising guests appearing on Fox News Channel.\n\nWhen he finally weighed in again Sunday night as criticism grew, Trump was unbowed.\n\nHe called on Walz and Frey, also a Democrat, to turn over for deportation anyone in the country illegally who was held in state prisons or local jails, along with anyone who has a warrant out for their arrest or a criminal history.\n\nIn his comments to The Wall Street Journal, Trump criticized Pretti for carrying a gun.\n\n“I don’t like any shooting. I don’t like it,” Trump said. “But I don’t like it when somebody goes into a protest and he’s got a very powerful, fully loaded gun with two magazines loaded up with bullets also. That doesn’t play good either.”\n\nHe said that immigration enforcement officers will leave Minneapolis “at some point” but did not offer a time frame.\n\nMembers of his administration, meanwhile, were quick to say the shooting, the second killing of a U.S. citizen in Minneapolis by immigration officers in recent weeks, was a case of an armed man provoking violence.\n\nDeputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller said in a post on social media, without offering any evidence, that Pretti was “an assassin” who “tried to murder federal agents.”\n\nVice President JD Vance shared Miller's post. He issued other ones blaming local officials and describing what was happening in Minneapolis as “engineered chaos” that was “the direct consequence of far left agitators, working with local authorities.”",

    "fullText": "A Republican gubernatorial candidate in Minnesota dropped his campaign as a direct response to the way the Trump administration has carried out its immigration enforcement.\n\nOn Monday morning, Republican candidate Chris Madel posted a 10-minute video on X/Twitter announcing his decision. He explained that although he was initially supportive of the Trump administration’s mission to remove violent criminals from communities in the state, the recent actions of ICE have displayed “retribution” on U.S. citizens instead.\n\nI cannot support the national Republicans’ stated retribution on the citizens of our state, nor can I count myself a member of a party that would do so. I support the originally stated goals of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Operation Metro Surge, in locating and deporting the worst of the worst from our state. And I’ve seen many examples of ICE arresting non-U.S. citizens in Minnesota convicted of serious crimes, including murder, rape, and child sexual assault. No reasonable person should want these people here, and I am glad that they are gone.\n\nBut Operation Metro Surge has expanded far beyond its stated focus on true public safety threats. United States citizens, particularly those of color, live in fear. United States citizens are carrying papers to prove their citizenship. That’s wrong. ICE has authorized its agents to raid homes using a civil warrant that need only be signed by a border patrol agent. That’s unconstitutional, and it’s wrong. Weaponizing criminal investigations against political opponents is unconstitutional, regardless of who is in power.\n\nI am ending my campaign for Minnesota Governor. I describe why in the below video. Please watch until the end. (It is 10 minutes, 52 seconds.)\n\nThank you,\nChris pic.twitter.com/2nfyAyTzNZ\n\n— Chris Madel (@CWMadel) January 26, 2026\n\nMadel also accused national Republicans of making it “nearly impossible for a Republican to win a statewide election in Minnesota,” calling the ICE operation in the state an “unmitigated disaster.” His decision came two days after ICE agents shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti .\n\nThe post Minnesota Republican Quits Governor’s Race in Stunning Video Trashing His Own Party Over ICE’s Recent Conduct first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump’s administration opposed efforts to expand the use of body cameras by immigration officers and sharply cut",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s administration opposed efforts to expand the use of body cameras by immigration officers and sharply cut oversight staffing as it surged officers into Minneapolis and other cities, leading to a series of violent clashes.\n\nFootage from bystanders of two fatal shootings of U.S. citizen protesters, including Saturday’s incident that ​left an ICU nurse dead, has underscored the power of video in checking official statements that have portrayed people who have been shot as provoking violent encounters with immigration officers.\n\nCameras worn by ‌officers long have been central to police reform efforts for this reason. The Trump administration, however, moved last year to slow-walk a pilot program to give ICE officers body cameras, urging Congress in June to cut the funding by 75% and bucking a nationwide trend ‌of cameras for law enforcement.\n\nOfficials last year also placed on paid leave nearly all staffers working for three internal watchdogs conducting oversight of immigration agencies, undermining their capacity to investigate abuses.\n\nDarius Reeves, who was the director of ICE’s Baltimore field office until August, said a body camera pilot program rollout had been slow in 2024 under President Biden, a Democrat, and “died on the vine” under Trump, a Republican.\n\nIn response to a request for comment, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said ICE officers “act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities.”\n\n“Anyone pointing the finger at law enforcement officers instead of the criminals is simply doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens,” she said.\n\nAt least three of ⁠the eight or more Border Patrol agents at the scene of Saturday's ‌shooting were wearing body cameras, a Reuters view of verified video showed. Reuters could not determine if the cameras were activated or if any agents involved in the physical encounter were wearing them.\n\nEFFORTS TO SLASH ICE BODY-CAM FUNDING\n\nWhen ICE or Border Patrol have engaged in acts of violence - including the fatal shootings of U.S. citizens Renee Good ‍and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis - top Trump officials have been quick to label the deceased as aggressors rather than call for thorough investigations.\n\nTrump has started ramping up immigration enforcement this year after Republicans in Congress passed a bill last year that provides $170 billion for the crackdown, a major funding surge expected to transform the way ICE and Border Patrol operate.\n\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s immigration agenda, called Pretti a “domestic terrorist” and “would-be assassin” in social ​media posts hours after he was fatally shot by a Border Patrol agent.\n\nThe shooting has galvanized some Democratic senators who say they will oppose a spending bill to fund the U.S. Department of Homeland Security ‌unless it reins in immigration enforcement.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection - Border Patrol’s parent agency - had 13,400 cameras for some 45,000 officers as of June, according to a congressional aide.\n\nICE launched a body-camera pilot program in 2024 and deployed cameras to officers in five cities: Baltimore, Buffalo, Detroit, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C.\n\nWhile the Trump administration kept the program, it called on Congress to freeze its expansion and slash funds to run it in its budget request for fiscal year 2026.\n\nThe proposal called for maintaining ICE’s 4,200 body-worn cameras but cutting the 22-person staff to three employees and running the program in a more “streamlined” approach.\n\nDHS says there are some 22,000 ICE officers but a federal workforce database suggests the figure is lower.\n\nA homeland security spending bill passed in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives last week rejected that proposal, instead providing $20 million for ICE and Border Patrol cameras.\n\nStill, the bill - ⁠which now faces a challenging route to passage in the U.S. Senate - did not require either agency to use the devices.\n\nScott ​Shuchart, a top ICE official under Biden, said officers do not bring the cameras with them when detailed to other locations ​outside their normal operating area, an issue that has been more relevant as officers have been surged to cities around the country.\n\nDHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nCOMPLAINTS UNANSWERED AS OVERSIGHT STAFF CUT\n\nThe Trump administration placed some 300 workers in three separate DHS oversight offices on paid leave in early 2025 as it redirected thousands of federal ‍agents from across government to assist its crackdown, a move ⁠that drew criticism from Democrats and civil rights groups.\n\nA lawsuit over the reductions argues the Trump administration effectively eliminated the offices, something only Congress would be authorized to do, and left no way to address abuses.\n\nIn May, a career federal employee, Ronald Sartini, was tasked with top roles at three of the oversight offices, including the one that handled allegations of abuse in immigration detention.\n\nAs of ⁠December, there were only a few employees per office. The Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman had three full-time employees and two detailees, compared to more than a hundred in March.\n\nIn 2023, OIDO received more than 11,000 complaints in person and received 282 ‌complaints via its web portal, court documents show. Between March and December of 2025, OIDO received 285 complaints in total, court documents show.",

ICE agents have the power to stop, detain and arrest people they suspect of being in the US illegally.\n\nRenee Good, another Minnesota resident, was shot and killed by an ICE agent on 7 January.\n\n\"Honestly, what I felt was that [the Timberwolves'] group was suffering,\" said Kerr after the Warriors' 111-85 win.\n\n\"It was one of the most bizarre, sad games I've ever been a part of. You could feel the sombre atmosphere.\n\n\"Their team, we could tell they were struggling with everything that's been going on. And what the city has been through. So it was a very sad night.\"\n\nWarriors forward Moses Moody, who scored 19 points with eight rebounds and two blocked shots, said you could \"feel the weight of the city\" during the match, which had been postponed for 24 hours after Pretti's death.\n\n\"I couldn't imagine too many different times where that large amount of people are together in the midst of a situation like this, so you definitely felt that,\" said Moody.\n\nStephen Curry led the scoring for the Warriors with 26 points to climb level with Paul Pierce at 19th on the all-time scoring list - finishing the game with 26,397.\n\nAnthony Edwards scored 32 points and recorded 11 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who lost a fifth-straight match.",

The guest turnout was also slim, with not as many Latino families present compared to last year.\n\nGina Arroyo, owner of Anahi’s Tamales & Tacos, told KOIN 6 News this is a problem now impacting her business all year round.\n\n“Last year we had so many vendors we couldn’t even walk the hallways,” Arroyo said.\n\nShe’s now lost three of her employees that she says are too afraid to leave their homes to come to work.\n\nWomen’s shelter in downtown Portland gets new mural\n\nThe proceeds for the event go to the non-profit organization Latino Leadership NW, which supports young Latino students.\n\n“A lot of people have mentioned when they have called [to] cancel, ‘We don’t want to put our families, we don’t want to put our students in a hurtful, hurtful situation,” said Latino Leadership NW Executive Director Diana Avalos-Leos. “Last year we had more Latino likely families participate, right. We saw the moms and dads and the grandmas and the little babies in strollers. And this year, we’re not seeing, we’re not seeing our families.”\n\nThe fewer customers showing up to festivals like this negatively impacts local businesses, Avalos-Leos said.\n\n“I don’t know nothing about presidents, I don’t know nothing about politics. But I just wish that we were in a safer life, that people don’t be afraid, that my workers can come, that everyone can come and help, you know, just these hateful things to stop,” Arroyo said.\n\nJewelry store owner, Diana Perez, shared the impact on her mental health.\n\n“I’m having nightmares,” she said. “I wake up with heavy breathing and panicking and, at times, I just lose that. I break down.”\n\nLive performers from various schools were also set up to perform at the event on Sunday. But organizers said they too canceled because of fear of deportation.\n\nOther vendors told KOIN 6 News they have friends and family members too scared to go to school and work, saying this fear is impacting the local economy and education. They also wish they saw more support from the community and local lawmakers.\n\nOrganizers said they’re not sure if they will be able to host the event next year, though vendors like Arroyo and others are still holding out hope that the festival can thrive again.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Chris Finch's voice cracked and faltered as the coach expressed on behalf of the Minnesota Timberwolves their heartbreak for the community's collective fear and pain from the ongoing immigration crackdown, following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by a federal officer.\n\nFinch presents a straightforward, no-nonsense approach in his public statements and rarely reveals much emotion, but he was clearly moved by the situation in Minneapolis before his team hosted Golden State on Sunday. The game between the Timberwolves and Warriors was postponed by 24 hours, after Pretti was killed on Saturday.\n\n“I’m more than a resident. This is my home. I love living here. I love being a part of this community. I’ve been embraced from day one. People have been amazing. It’s sad to watch what is happening,” said Finch, who was hired by the Timberwolves five years ago. “On the human level, certainly as somebody who takes great pride in being here, I know a lot of our players feel the same. They all love being here, and it’s just hard to watch what we’re going through.”\n\nThe Timberwolves held a moment of silence for Pretti prior to the national anthem, just as they did for Renee Good before their game on Jan. 8, the day after she was fatally shot by a federal officer. The Trump administration in December launched what the Department of Homeland Security declared the largest immigration enforcement operation in history and earlier this month announced a surge of more officers to push their force past 2,000.\n\nThe NBA announced Saturday that the rescheduling decision was made to “prioritize the safety and security of the Minneapolis community” after Pretti was killed during a confrontation in a commercial district less than 2 miles south of Target Center. Finch said on Sunday that the Timberwolves pushed for the postponement to respect the public grieving process.\n\n“Playing basketball just didn't feel like the right thing to do,” Finch said, thanking the NBA and the Warriors for their support.\n\nWarriors coach Steve Kerr, long one of the league's most outspoken coaches, was measured but clearly moved as he expressed his own sympathy.\n\n“This has always been a great stop on the NBA tour. I love the city of Minneapolis. People here are wonderful, and it’s very sad what’s happening. I feel for the city. There’s a pall that’s been cast over the city. You can feel it. A lot of people are suffering, and obviously a loss of life is the number one concern. Those families will never get their family members back,” Kerr said.\n\nTens of thousands of people swarmed downtown Minneapolis on Friday in protest of the tactics and presence of immigration officers, a crowd the Warriors could see from their hotel as it moved toward Target Center. A smaller protest march took place downtown before the game Sunday.\n\nThere were plenty of other voices being raised around the sports world on Sunday. Women's basketball star Breanna Stewart held a sign with \"abolish ICE\" printed on it during introductions at her Unrivaled league game. Minnesota Frost fans during a PWHL game chanted “Ice out now!” The NBA Players Association issued a statement in support of the protests in Minnesota and urged its members to speak up.\n\nThe perspectives in a polarized country vary wildly on what constitutes constitutionally protected protesting and what becomes violent political disruption, and Kerr seemed to sense that tension as he spoke before the game on Sunday.\n\n“People are so angry. There should be an appeal to our better angels to look after one another and to recognize what’s happening. We’re being divided by media for profit, by misinformation. There’s so much out there that is really difficult for all of us to sort of reconcile,” Kerr said. “And so in times like these you have to lean on values and who you are and who you want to be, either as an individual or a country.”\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

    "description": "A federal immigration agent shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti, a US citizen, in Minneapolis on Saturday. He was an ICU nurse at a VA hospital.",
    "fullText": "America's largest network of labor unions has condemned ICE after a federal agent on Saturday shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident.\n\nThe AFL-CIO, which represents nearly 15 million workers, called Pretti's death \"senseless.\"\n\n\"As tens of thousands of Minnesotans made clear peacefully and powerfully yesterday, the Trump administration's horrific operation — and their actions aimed at stoking violence and chaos — must end,\" the labor group said in a statement.\n\n\"America's unions join the call for ICE to immediately leave Minnesota before anyone else is hurt or killed. We demand local authorities conduct a full, transparent investigation that will lead to accountability for this tragic and violent act, and for Congress to use its power to hold ICE accountable.\"\n\nA federal agent fatally shot Pretti in Minneapolis, where he worked as an ICU nurse at a US Department of Veterans Affairs hospital. Minneapolis police confirmed on Saturday that Pretti is a US citizen. He had been filming the agents when the confrontation began.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Border Patrol and ICE, said Pretti was carrying a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and \"approached\" agents at the scene. The department said officers tried to disarm Pretti, but he resisted. In multiple videos of the incident, however, Pretti is never seen threatening agents and is disarmed and subdued before he is shot. Minneapolis police said Pretti had a permit to carry the weapon.\n\nThe DHS deployed ICE and other federal agents to Minnesota as part of an immigration enforcement sweep called Operation Metro Surge, which began in December. The department says it has deployed around 2,000 federal agents across the state to detain and deport illegal immigrants. Trump has made securing the border and deporting those in the US who lack proper paperwork a central part of his administration's agenda.\n\nLocal residents and business owners, however, have criticized the tactics federal agents are using to find and detain those people, resulting in protests across the state. Tensions further escalated after an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old American citizen, on January 7.\n\nThe CEOs of Minnesota's largest businesses, including Target, Cargill, Allianz, and UnitedHealth, called for \"immediate de-escalation\" in a joint statement on Sunday.\n\nOn Saturday, Minnesota AFL-CIO President Bernie Burnham shared a statement calling for a \"full and transparent investigation\" into the recent shootings.\n\n\"'Operation Metro Surge' is not and has never been about enforcing immigration law. This is about a President who is angry with the people of Minnesota for disagreeing with his policies and is weaponizing the federal government against us in retribution,\" Burnham said.\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing Pretti and other federal workers in the US, also criticized the Trump administration in a statement on Saturday. As an employee of the VA hospital, Pretti was a member of AFGE Local 3669.\n\n\"While details of the incident are still emerging, one fact is already clear: this tragedy did not happen in a vacuum. It is the direct result of an administration that has chosen reckless policy, inflammatory rhetoric, and manufactured crisis over responsible leadership and de-escalation,\" AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in the statement.\n\nKelley said the presence of federal agents has stoked fear and division in the community.\n\n\"I urge everyone to remain disciplined and measured in public, even as we are rightly angry. Still, we must do what we can to maintain peace and calm,\" Kelley said. \"But do not mistake restraint for acceptance. Accountability will come, and AFGE will not be silent about the policies and decisions that led us here.\"",

    "description": "The shooting comes two weeks after the killing of Renee Good by an immigration agent in the city, which sparked protests",
    "fullText": "A man was shot and killed by an immigration agent in Minneapolis on Saturday morning, the second fatal shooting in a little over two weeks by federal authorities in the city.\n\nThe incident follows the Jan. 7 killing of Minneapolis woman Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, by a federal agent, and comes a day after mass protests in the city over a surge of immigration officers and sweeping raids across the state.\n\nA video of the incident, which took place at around 9 am, appears to show a large group of federal agents struggling with a man before one of the agents pulls a gun and fires several shots. The agent continues to fire while the man lies motionless on the floor.\n\nMinneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara told the Minnesota Star Tribune that the man died soon after. The victim was a 51-year-old man, according to hospital records obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a statement that it was carrying out a \"targeted operation\" when an individual approached U.S. Border Patrol officers with a 9mm semi-automatic handgun. DHS claimed the officers attempted to disarm the suspect, \"but the armed suspect violently resisted.\"\n\n\"Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, an agent fired defensive shots. Medics on scene immediately delivered medical aid to the subject but was pronounced dead at the scene,\" the statement continued.\n\nA separate video showing the lead-up to the fatal shooting shows the man standing still, filming a group of federal officers with his phone, before an agent approaches and pushes him backwards. The video then cuts before the shooting takes place.\n\nThe shooting prompted a wave of anger from local politicians, many of whom have been calling for the Trump Administration to bring an end to its immigration surge following weeks of violent encounters with Minnesotans, including the use of pepper spray and the arrest of peaceful protesters.\n\nMinnesota Governor Tim Walz called the shooting \"sickening\" and called on President Trump to end his immigration crackdown in the state.\n\n“I just spoke with the White House after another horrific shooting by federal agents this morning. Minnesota has had it. This is sickening,” Walz said in a post on X.\n\n“The President must end this operation. Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now.”\n\nDemocratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said: To the Trump administration and the Republicans in Congress who have stood silent: Get ICE out of our state NOW.\n\nThe City of Minneapolis said in a statement on X that the shooting had taken place in the area of 26th Street W and Nicollet Ave.\n\n\"We are working to confirm additional details. We ask the public to remain calm and avoid the immediate area,\" it added.\n\nA few hundreds 300 protesters gathered at the scene of the shooting in south Minneapolis by noon, where they scuffled with federal agents who had blocked off the intersection. Protesters screamed \"I smell Nazis\" at the federal agents and shouted at them to \"go home.\"\n\nThe agents deployed tear gas and used pepper-spray as they fought running battles with protesters.\n\nThe shooting comes a day after thousands took to the streets across Minnesota on Friday, closing down businesses and calling out of work in a mass protest against the Trump Administration’s immigration crackdown in the state.\n\nThe “Ice Out of Minnesota: Day of Truth and Freedom” demonstration, organized by community leaders, members of the clergy, and labor unions, called for a “no work, no school, no shopping” economic blackout.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A vast network of labor unions, progressive organizations and clergy urged Minnesotans to stay away from work, school and stores Friday to protest immigration enforcement operations, even as subzero temperatures beset the state.\n\nMinneapolis and St. Paul have seen daily protests since Renee Good was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Jan. 7. Federal law enforcement officers have surged in the Twin Cities for weeks and have repeatedly squared off with community members and activists who track their movements.\n\nOrganizers said Friday morning that more than 700 businesses across the state have closed for the day in solidarity with the protest -- from a bookstore in tiny Grand Marais near the Canadian border to the landmark Guthrie Theater in downtown Minneapolis.\n\n“We’re achieving something historic,” said Kate Havelin of Indivisible Twin Cities, one of the more than 100 groups that is mobilizing. The demonstration coincides with a blast of cold air hitting the Upper Midwest and ahead of a severe winter storm that is expected to affect millions.\n\nOn Friday, Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino sought to shift the narrative from that of a 5-year-old boy detained by ICE officers in Minneapolis by attacking the news media for, in his view, insufficient coverage of children who have lost parents to violence by people in the country illegally. After briefly mentioning the 5-year-old during a news conference, he talked about a mother of five who was killed in August 2023.\n\nOn Thursday, a prominent civil rights attorney and at least two other people were arrested for their involvement in an anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a Sunday service at a church in St. Paul. They remained in federal custody Friday morning.\n\nOrganizers hope Friday’s mobilization will be the largest coordinated protest action to date, with a march in downtown Minneapolis planned for Friday afternoon. Earlier Friday, the temperature in Minneapolis was minus 21 with a wind chill of minus 40 (minus 29 Celsius with a wind chill of minus 40 Celsius).\n\nHavelin compared the presence of immigration officers in Minnesota to the winter weather warnings.\n\n“Minnesotans understand that when we’re in a snow emergency … we all have to respond and it makes us do things differently,” she said. “And what’s happening with ICE in our community, in our state, means that we can’t respond as business as usual.”\n\nSomali businesses especially have lost sales during the enforcement surge as workers and customers, fearing detention, stay at home.\n\nMany schools were planning to close Friday, but cited different reasons. The University of Minnesota and the St. Paul public school district said there would be no in-person classes because of the extreme cold. Minneapolis Public Schools were scheduled to be closed “for a teacher record keeping day.”\n\nClergy planned to join the march as well as hold prayer services and fasting, according to a delegation of representatives of faith traditions including Buddhist, Jewish, Lutheran and Muslim.\n\nBishop Dwayne Royster, leader of the progressive organization Faith in Action, arrived in Minnesota on Wednesday from Washington, D.C.\n\n“We want ICE out of Minnesota,” he said. “We want them out of all the cities around the country where they’re exercising extreme overreach.”\n\nRoyster said at least 50 of his network’s faith-based organizers were joining the protest. About 10 were traveling from Los Angeles while others from the same group planned a solidarity rally in California, said one of the organizers there.\n\n“It was a very harrowing experience,” said the Rev. Jennifer Gutierrez of the large immigration enforcement operation in Los Angeles last year. “We believe God is on the side of migrants.”",

We appreciate the professionalism of all parties involved,” a spokesperson for the team told the media.\n\nLee’s agent, Scott Boras, told the San Francisco Chronicle it was “not anything political or anything like that.”\n\nDetentions by federal agents have become a hot-button issue amid President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.\n\nLee arrived at LAX ahead of an appearance at the Giants’ FanFest in San Ramon on Saturday. The tour, which has multiple stops across Northern California, gives fans a chance to meet players and coaches.\n\nLee is of South Korean descent, but he was born in Nagoya, Japan, where his father, Korean baseball star Jong Beom Lee, was playing for the Chunichi Dragons, according to his MLB profile. During his introductory press conference, Lee called himself “Grandson of the Wind.” His father is known as “Son of the Wind.”\n\nLee made his debut in the majors in March 2024 after playing for the Kiwoom Heroes in Korea for seven years. Lee agreed to a six-year contract with the Giants worth $113 million in December 2023, ESPN reported, citing unnamed sources, at the time.\n\nThe Giants will begin spring training for the 2026 season in Scottsdale, Arizona, in early February.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A prominent civil rights attorney and at least two other people involved in an anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a service at a Minnesota church have been arrested, Trump administration officials said Thursday, even as a judge rebuffed related charges against journalist Don Lemon.\n\nVice President JD Vance, speaking in Minneapolis, urged state and local law enforcement to collaborate with federal officials and said protesters must stop getting in their way.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi posted online that Nekima Levy Armstrong had been arrested. On Sunday, protesters entered the Cities Church in St. Paul, where an U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official serves as a pastor. Bondi later posted that a second person had been arrested, and FBI Director Kash Patel announced a third.\n\nThe Justice Department quickly opened a civil rights investigation after the group interrupted services by chanting “ICE out” and “Justice for Renee Good,\" referring to the 37-year-old mother of three who was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis earlier this month.\n\n“Listen loud and clear: WE DO NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS ON PLACES OF WORSHIP,\" the attorney general wrote on X.\n\nCities Church belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention and lists one of its pastors as David Easterwood, who leads an ICE field office. Many Baptist churches have pastors who also work other jobs.\n\nChurch lawyers praise the arrests\n\nProminent leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention have argued that compassion for migrant families cannot justify violating a sacred space during worship.\n\nAttorneys representing the church hailed the arrests.\n\n“The U.S. Department of Justice acted decisively by arresting those who coordinated and carried out the terrible crime,” Doug Wardlow, director of litigation for True North Legal, said in a statement.\n\nThe St. Paul-based nonprofit law firm has taken on religious freedom cases, including filing an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court supporting a Christian counselor who challenged bans on LGBTQ+ “conversion therapy” for kids as a violation of her First Amendment rights.\n\nLevy Armstrong, an attorney and longtime activist, had called for the pastor affiliated with ICE to resign, saying his dual role poses a “fundamental moral conflict.”\n\n“You cannot lead a congregation while directing an agency whose actions have cost lives and inflicted fear in our communities,” she said Tuesday. “When officials protect armed agents, repeatedly refuse meaningful investigation into killings like Renee Good’s, and signal they may pursue peaceful protesters and journalists, that is not justice — it is intimidation.”\n\nVance wants local law enforcement to assist federal officers\n\nState and local elected officials have opposed the crackdown that has become a major focus of Department of Homeland Security sweeps.\n\nVance arrived in the state less than a month after Renee Good was killed. He has called Good’s death a “tragedy of her own making.”\n\nBefore his Minnesota visit, Vance warned the church protesters: “Those people are going to be sent to prison so long as we have the power to do so.\"\n\nLater in Minneapolis, he urged state and city law enforcement to help federal immigration officers.\n\n“We’re doing everything that we can to lower the temperature,” Vance said, adding that he wants “state and local officials to meet us halfway.”\n\nGreg Bovino, a U.S. Border Patrol official, said Minneapolis police failed to help federal agents Wednesday who were surrounded by protesters at a gas station. Minneapolis police responded later that they hadn't received any requests from federal agents for assistance on Wednesday.\n\nLevy Armstrong has helped lead protests after the high-profile police-involved killings of Black Americans, including George Floyd, Philando Castile and Jamar Clark. She is a former president of the NAACP’s Minneapolis branch.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted a photo on X of Levy Armstrong with her arms behind her back next to a person wearing a badge. Noem said she faces a charge under a statute that bars threatening or intimidating someone exercising a right.\n\nPatel posted on X that Chauntyll Louisa Allen, the second person Bondi said was arrested, is charged under a law that prohibits physically obstructing or using the threat of force to intimidate or interfere with a person seeking to participate in a service at a house of worship. Patel said William Kelly has also been arrested.\n\nLevy Armstrong, Kelly and Allen have all been booked about 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of Minneapolis in Sherburne County Jail, where people in federal custody are usually held.\n\nA message seeking comment was sent to Allen's and Kelly's attorney.\n\nSaint Paul Public Schools, where Allen is a board of education member, said it is aware of her arrest but will not comment on pending legal matters.\n\nAllen and Levy Armstrong are part of a community of Black Minnesota activists.\n\nKelly has defended the protest and criticized the church for associating with a pastor who works for ICE.\n\nIn court Thursday, federal magistrate judge Doug Micko granted the women bond and restricted them from traveling outside Minnesota or from going near the church. The government said it would appeal and the women remained in federal custody Thursday afternoon.\n\nLevy Armstrong’s attorney, Jordan Kushner, said he offered for her to turn herself in peacefully, but the Trump administration insisted on arresting her.\n\n“They wanted a spectacle,” Levy Armstrong’s husband, Marques Armstrong, said, recalling around 50 agents came to detain her.\n\nArrests follow a DOJ civil rights investigation\n\nThe Justice Department investigated the church protest swiftly, but found no basis for a civil rights investigation into Good's death.\n\nAdministration officials have said the officer acted in self-defense and that the driver of the Honda was engaging in “an act of domestic terrorism” when she pulled toward him. Past administrations, however, have moved quickly to probe shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials.\n\nThe Justice Department has separately opened an investigation into whether Minnesota officials impeded or obstructed federal immigration enforcement though their public statements. Prosecutors this week sent subpoenas to the offices of Gov. Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her and officials in Ramsey and Hennepin counties, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nJudge rejects charges against Lemon\n\nA magistrate judge rejected federal prosecutors’ bid to charge journalist Don Lemon related to the church protest, said Kushner, Levy Armstrong’s attorney.\n\nLemon has said he was at the church as a journalist and not a protester.\n\n“Once the protest started in the church we did an act of journalism which was report on it and talk to the people involved, including the pastor, members of the church and members of the organization,” Lemon said in a video posted on social media. “That’s it. That’s called journalism.”\n\nLemon's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement that the judge’s action confirms Lemon’s work as a reporter was protected by the First Amendment.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear what the Justice Department would do after the judge’s decision. Authorities could return to a magistrate judge to again seek a criminal complaint or an indictment against Lemon before a grand jury.\n\nCNN, which fired Lemon in 2023, first reported the ruling.\n\nDurkin Richer reported from Washington. Associated Press reporters Chris Megerian in Washington; Corey Williams in Detroit; Jack Dura in Bismarck, North Dakota; and Mike Catalini in Trenton, New Jersey, contributed.",

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled on Thursday that the academics, who are party to a lawsuit alleging U.S. policy singles out noncitizens for detention or deportation over their pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses, can seek relief from the court if their immigration status is changed as retribution for taking part in the case.\n\nThe ruling from U.S. District Judge William Young comes in the wake of trial last year, in which he ruled the Trump administration violated the Constitution when it targeted non-U.S. citizens for deportation solely for supporting Palestinians and criticizing Israel. Young repeatedly chastised the administration for violating the First Amendment rights of the plaintiffs and, on Thursday, issued what he described as “remedial sanction to protect certain of the Plaintiffs’ noncitizen members from any retribution for the free exercise of their constitutional rights.”\n\nDuring the hearing in the case earlier this month, Young maintained that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their agents had engaged in an “unconstitutional conspiracy” to limit the free speech of the plaintiffs, creating a chilling effect on their rights by their attempts to “pick off certain people.”\n\n“The big problem in this case is that the cabinet secretaries, ostensibly and president of the United States, are not honoring the First Amendment,” said Young, an appointee of the late Republican President Ronald Reagan. “There doesn’t seem to be an understanding of what the First Amendment is by this government.”\n\nIn his ruling, Young said that a noncitizen challenging his or her immigration status change would have to prove that they were a member of the American Association of University Professors and Middle East Studies Association, the two groups that sued, between March 25, 2025, and Sept. 30, 2025. They would also have to show their immigration status had not expired and had not committed any crime after Sept. 30, 2025. The Associated Press is not aware of any members of these groups whose status has changed because they are part of the lawsuit.\n\n“Upon such proof, it shall be presumed that the alteration in immigration status is in retribution for the exercise during the course of the present case of their First Amendment rights,” Young wrote.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment\n\nDuring last year's trial, witnesses for the government acknowledged that the campaign targeted more than 5,000 pro-Palestinian protesters. Other witnesses for the plaintiffs testified to how the campaign stoked fear among academics and prompted some to stop their activism.\n\nAmong the cases that have fueled the lawsuit was that of former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil. Earlier this month, a federal appeals panel reversed a lower court decision that released Khalil from an immigration jail, bringing the government one step closer to detaining and ultimately deporting the Palestinian activist.\n\nThe three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals didn’t decide the key issue in Khalil’s case: whether the Trump administration’s effort to throw Khalil out of the U.S. over his campus activism and criticism of Israel was unconstitutional.\n\nBut in its 2-1 decision, the panel ruled a federal judge in New Jersey didn’t have jurisdiction to decide the matter at this time. Federal law requires the case to fully move through the immigration courts first, before Khalil can challenge the decision, they wrote.\n\nThe decision marked a major win for the Trump administration’s sweeping campaign to detain and deport noncitizens who joined protests against Israel. But it was not immediately clear whether the government would seek to detain Khalil, a legal permanent resident, again while his legal challenges continue.\n\nAnother was the Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was released in May from six weeks of detention after being arrested on a suburban Boston street. She said she was illegally detained following an op-ed piece she co-wrote last year criticizing her school’s response to Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nDuring the latest hearing in the case, Young repeatedly seemed baffled that the country's top leaders would attempt to implement such a policy.\n\n“How could this happen? How could our government’s highest officials seek to so infringe on the rights of people lawfully here in the United States,” he told the court. “The record in this case convinces me that these high officials, and I include the president of the United States, have a fearful view of freedom.”\n\nRamya Krishnan, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute, which argued for relief in court, said the “administration’s lawless efforts to deport pro-Palestinian advocates has spread terror in our campus communities.”\n\n“Students and scholars shouldn’t have to live in fear that ICE agents could seize them from their homes merely for engaging in political expression,” she said. “Today’s judgment makes emphatically clear that the administration’s campaign of intimidation must end.”",

    "fullText": "CHICAGO (AP) — A man accused of offering a $10,000 bounty over Snapchat for the life of a top Border Patrol leader was found not guilty on Thursday in the first criminal trial stemming from the Chicago-area immigration crackdown that started last year.\n\nJurors deliberated less than 4 hours before returning the favorable verdict for 37-year-old Juan Espinoza Martinez. He faced one count of murder-for-hire and up to 10 years in prison if convicted. Testimony lasted mere hours in the federal trial that was the latest test of the Trump administration’s credibility on federal surges that have played out from Minnesota to Maine.\n\nEspinoza Martinez, who wore a suit and tie, listened intently with his arms crossed near his stomach. He hugged his attorneys and shook their hands after court adjourned.\n\nAttorneys for the defense declined comment. Prosecutors did not address reporters waiting in the lobby of the federal court in downtown Chicago. Neither did jurors.\n\nAt the heart of the government’s case were Snapchat messages sent from Espinoza Martinez to his younger brother and a friend who turned out to be a government informant. One read in part “10k if u take him down,” along with a picture of Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol official who has led aggressive crackdowns nationwide, including in the Chicago area.\n\n“Those words do not indicate that this was a joke,” First Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Yonan told jurors during Thursday's closing arguments. “Those words have meaning. They are not innocent and harmless words.”\n\nBut defense attorneys said the government didn’t show any evidence against Espinoza Martinez who sent the messages as “neighborhood gossip” after coming home from work and unwinding with beers. He didn’t follow up on the exchanges and had only a few dollars in his bank account.\n\n“Sending a message about gossip that you heard in the neighborhood, it’s not murder for hire,” his defense attorney Dena Singer told jurors. “It’s not a federal crime.”\n\nHer office did not return a message seeking comment after the verdict. Neither did the U.S. attorney's office in Chicago or the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn court, prosecutors accused Espinoza Martinez of being “fixated and obsessed” with Bovino and cited other messages where he criticized the crackdown.\n\nEspinoza Martinez was arrested in October as the city of 2.7 million and surrounding suburbs were seeing a surge of federal immigration officers. Protests and standoffs with agents were common, particularly in the city’s heavily Mexican Little Village neighborhood where Espinoza Martinez lived.\n\nHe did not testify at his trial.\n\nBut attorneys played clips of his interview with law enforcement where he said he was confused about the charges and that he sent the messages without much thought while scrolling social media after work.\n\n“I didn’t threaten anyone,” he told investigators, interchanging English and Spanish at times in the interview. “I’m not saying that I was telling them to do it.”\n\nBorn in Mexico, he’s lived in Chicago for years but doesn’t have citizenship.\n\nDHS touted Espinoza Martinez’s arrest on social media with unredacted photos of his face, referring to him as a “depraved” gang member. Bovino has held the case up as an example of the increasing dangers faced by federal agents. Prosecutors included Yonan, the second-highest ranking federal prosecutor in the Chicago region.\n\nBut several federal lawsuits in Chicago have fueled skepticism about DHS’s narratives. Of the roughly 30 criminal cases stemming from Operation Midway Blitz, charges have been dismissed or dropped in about half. In a notable lawsuit that forced Bovino to sit for depositions, a federal judge found he lied under oath including about alleged gang threats.\n\nBovino did not testify at Espinoza Martinez’s trial.\n\nNationwide, dozens of criminal cases tied to immigration operations have also crumbled.\n\nFederal prosecutors initially referred to Espinoza Martinez as a “ranking member” of the Latin Kings, but their lack of evidence led U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow to bar testimony on the Chicago street gang at trial. According to the criminal complaint, Espinoza Martinez allegedly sent messages on behalf of the gang to other gang members.\n\nAt trial, there were minor mentions of the gang, including Espinoza Martinez saying in his interview that he had nothing to do with the Latin Kings. His brother, Oscar, testified that he took the Snapchat messages as a joke and were something he’d already seen on Facebook.\n\nSinger poked holes in the government’s case, including in the testimony of their first witness Adrian Jimenez.\n\nThe 44-year-old owns a construction company and had been in touch with Espinoza Martinez over Snapchat about work. Unknown to Espinoza Martinez, he had also worked as a paid government informant over the years after serving a prison sentence for a felony. He shared the Snapchats with a federal investigator.\n\nJimenez, who suffers from back problems, walked slowly with a limp to the witness chair and needed help getting up.\n\n“Would you solicit for hire an individual that was in that much pain and could barely walk?” Singer said to jurors. “That doesn’t make any sense.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A Cuban migrant held in solitary confinement at an immigration detention facility in Texas died after guards held him down and he stopped breathing, according to an autopsy report released Wednesday that ruled the death a homicide.\n\nGeraldo Lunas Campos died Jan. 3 following an altercation with guards. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said the 55-year-old father of four was attempting suicide and the staff tried to save him.\n\nBut a witness told The Associated Press last week that Lunas Campos was handcuffed as at least five guards held him down and one put an arm around his neck and squeezed until he was unconscious.\n\nHis death was one of at least three reported in little more than a month at Camp East Montana, a sprawling tent facility in the desert on the grounds of Fort Bliss, an Army base.\n\nThe autopsy report by the El Paso County Medical Examiner’s Office found Lunas Campos' body showed signs of a struggle, including abrasions on his chest and knees. He also had hemorrhages on his neck. The deputy medical examiner, Dr. Adam Gonzalez. determined the cause of death was asphyxia due to neck and torso compression.\n\nThe report said witnesses saw Lunas Campos “become unresponsive while being physically restrained by law enforcement.” It did not elaborate on what happened during the struggle but cited evidence of injuries to his neck, head and torso associated with physical restraint. The report also noted the presence of petechial hemorrhages — tiny blood spots from burst capillaries that can be associated with intense strain or injury — in the eyelids and skin of the neck.\n\nDr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist who reviewed the autopsy report for AP, said the presence of petechiae in the eyes support the conclusion that asphyxia caused the death. Those injuries suggest pressure on the body and are often associated with such deaths, he said.\n\nHe said the contusions on Lunas Campos’ body may reflect physical restraint and the neck injuries were consistent with a hand or knee on the neck.\n\nThe autopsy also found the presence of prescription antidepressant and antihistamine medications, adding that Lunas Campos had a history of bipolar disorder and anxiety. It made no mention of him attempting suicide.\n\nGovernment provided changing accounts of what happened\n\nICE's initial account of the death, which included no mention of an altercation with guards, said Lunas Campos had become disruptive and staff moved him into a cellblock where detainees are held away from others.\n\n“While in segregation, staff observed him in distress and contacted on-site medical personnel for assistance,” the agency said in its Jan. 9 statement. “Medical staff responded, initiated lifesaving measures, and requested emergency medical services.”\n\nLunas Campos was pronounced dead after paramedics arrived.\n\nLast Thursday, after Lunas Campos' family was first informed the death was likely to be ruled a homicide, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin amended the government's account, saying he had attempted suicide and guards tried to help him.\n\n“Campos violently resisted the security staff and continued to attempt to take his life,” she said. “During the ensuing struggle, Campos stopped breathing and lost consciousness.”\n\nAfter the final autopsy report was released Wednesday, McLaughlin issued a statement emphasizing that Lunas Campos was “a criminal illegal alien and convicted child sex predator.”\n\nNew York court records show Lunas Campos was convicted in 2003 of sexual contact with a person under 11, a felony for which he was sentenced to one year in jail and placed on the state’s sex offender registry. Lunas Campos was also sentenced to five years in prison and three years of supervision in 2009 after being convicted of attempting to sell a controlled substance, according to the New York corrections records. He completed the sentence in January 2017.\n\n“ICE takes seriously the health and safety of all those detained in our custody,\" McLaughlin said Wednesday, adding that the agency was investigating the death. DHS has not responded to questions about whether any outside law enforcement agency was also investigating.\n\nDeaths put a spotlight on Camp East Montana\n\nThe AP reported in August that the $1.2 billion contract to build and operate Camp East Montana, expected to become the largest detention facility in the U.S., was awarded to a private contractor headquartered in a single-family home in Richmond, Virginia. The company, Acquisition Logistics LLC, had no prior experience running a corrections facility and has subcontracted with other companies to help operate the camp.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the guards present when Lunas Campos died were government employees or those of a private contractor.\n\nA final determination of homicide by the medical examiner would typically be critical in determining whether any guards are held criminally or civilly liable. The fact that Lunas Campos died on an Army base could limit state and local officials’ legal jurisdiction to investigate.\n\nLunas Campos was among the first detainees sent to Camp Montana East, arriving in September after ICE arrested him in Rochester, New York, where he lived for more than two decades. He was legally admitted to the U.S. in 1996, part of a wave of Cuban immigrants seeking to reach Florida by boat.\n\nICE said he was picked up in July as part of a planned immigration enforcement operation due to criminal convictions that made him eligible for removal.\n\nIn addition to Lunas Campos, ICE announced that on Dec. 3 an immigrant from Guatemala held in Camp East Montana died after being transferred to a El Paso hospital for care. While the cause of death was still pending, the agency said Francisco Gaspar-Andres, 48, was suspected to have died of liver and kidney failure.\n\nOn Sunday, ICE announced that Victor Manuel Diaz, a 36-year-old immigrant from Nicaragua, died at Camp East Montana on Jan. 14 of a “presumed suicide.” The agency said Diaz was detained by ICE earlier this month during the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.\n\nUnlike with the two prior deaths, Diaz's body wasn't sent to the county medical examiner in El Paso. McLaughlin said Wednesday that the autopsy for Diaz is being performed at the Army medical center at Fort Bliss. DHS again did not respond to questions about whether any agency other than ICE will investigate the death.\n\nRep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes El Paso, called on DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd M. Lyons to brief Congress about the recent deaths.\n\n“DHS must preserve all evidence — including halting their effort to deport the witnesses,” Escobar said Wednesday. “I reiterate my call for Camp East Montana to be shut down and for the contract with the corporation running it to be terminated.”",

The officers then told him to knock on the door to his home to see if other people were inside, “essentially using a 5-year-old as bait,\" she said.\n\nStenvik said the family has an active asylum case and has not been ordered to leave the country.\n\n“Why detain a 5-year-old?” she asked. \"You cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal.”\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that “ICE did NOT target a child.”\n\nShe said Immigration and Customs Enforcement was conducting an operation to arrest the child’s father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, who McLaughlin said is from Ecuador and in the U.S. illegally. He fled on foot, “abandoning his child,” she said.\n\n“For the child’s safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended Conejo Arias,” McLaughlin said, adding that parents are given the choice to be removed with their children or have them placed with a person of their choosing.\n\nStenvik said another adult who lives at the home was outside when the father and son were taken, but agents wouldn't leave Liam with that person. DHS didn't immediately respond to an email Thursday asking if Conejo Arias had asked to keep his son with him.\n\nLiam and his father were being held in a family holding cell in Texas, Marc Prokosch, the family’s lawyer, said during the news conference.\n\n“Every step of their immigration process has been doing what they’ve been asked to do,” Prokosch said of the family's asylum claim. “So this is just cruelty.”\n\nMinnesota has become a major focus of immigration sweeps by DHS-led agencies. Greg Bovino, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official who has been the face of the crackdowns in Minneapolis and other cities, said 3,000 “of some of the most dangerous offenders” have been arrested in Minnesota in the last six weeks.\n\nJulia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said advocates have no way of knowing whether the government’s arrest numbers and descriptions of the people in custody are accurate.\n\nLiam is the fourth student from Columbia Heights Public Schools who has been detained by ICE in recent weeks, said Stenvik. A 17-year-old student was taken Tuesday while heading to school, and a 10-year-old and a 17-year-old have also been taken, she said.\n\nThe district is made up of five schools and about 3,400 students from pre-K to 12th grade, according to its website. The majority of the students come from immigrant families, according to Stenvik.\n\nShe said they've noticed their attendance drop over the past two weeks, including one day where they had about one-third of their students out from school.\n\nElla Sullivan, Liam’s teacher, described him as “kind and loving.”\n\n“His classmates miss him,” she said. \"And all I want is for him to be safe and back here.”\n\nThis story was updated to correct Greg Bovino's title to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection offical, not Patrol.",

    "fullText": "Online conservative figures are throwing a fit over newly inaugurated Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger implementing her policies.\n\nThe online right has been lamenting Spanberger’s first week as governor, claiming she was just acting as a moderate while running for office and has now taken a far-left turn.\n\nIn her first few days as governor, Spanberger signed several executive orders, one of which ended state and local cooperation with federal immigration agents, a policy proposal that she said she would enact if elected.\n\nConservatives are expressing outrage over Spanberger’s first moves, equating her to a villain, a witch, and one of the “most dangerous people in our society.”\n\nSpanberger’s overall agenda as governor, outlined on her campaign website, also aligns with her three terms as a House Democrat.\n\nThe Virginia-based Lepanto Institute, a Catholic organization, compared Spanberger to the White Witch in the Chronicles of Narnia in a post on X.\n\n“White liberal women are the most dangerous people in our society,” MAGA activist Laura Loomer posted to her 1.8 million followers on X.\n\nHarmeet K. Dhillon, assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice, called Spanberger “a Bond villain.”\n\nRepublican Arizona Congressman Abe Hamadeh posted on X that “What’s happening in Virginia should be a lesson to all Congressional Republicans. If Democrats regain power, they will unleash the most radical and transformative legislative agenda in our nation’s history.”\n\n“We won’t even recognize our country, and we may never get it back,” Hamadeh, who is known for introducing a bill that would mandate states only provide English-language voting ballots, claimed.\n\nSpeaking on Special Report with Bret Baier on Fox News, Josh Holmes, co-host of the Ruthless podcast, said of Spanberger, “She’s there for a cup of coffee, and all of a sudden, we have a Communist manifesto in front of us. This is going fast and furious, but it is how Democrats govern, regardless of what they say.”\n\nConservative nepo-baby Meghan McCain came under fire for posting a photo of Spanberger during the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection attempt, during which she was wearing an emergency escape hood.\n\n“Virginia is f---ed,” the post, which she deleted, said.\n\n“Screw any and all of you who lied to low information voters and sold Abigail Spanberger as some kind of moderate,” McCain said in a follow-up post. “She’s been in office like 6 hours and is already trying to turn Virginia into Minneapolis.”\n\nOther MAGA figures went further with their criticism of Spanberger, firing off theories about the Democrat governor and calling for certain Virginia counties to secede.\n\nMichelle Maxwell, a self-described “Proud Virginia Constitutional Conservative,” claimed that the Democratic Party is “grooming” Spanberger to run for president and that she would be the “new Hillary.”\n\n“Being governor is just a stepping stone. So while everyone is distracted with Gavin [Newsom] she is the plan,” she posted to her more than 330,000 followers, adding “Spanberger is the country’s problem now&we better not take her lightly.”\n\nMaxwell also claimed that New Jersey Gov. Mikie Sherrill, who is seen as comparable to Spanberger in terms of policies and demeanor, was also being groomed by the Democratic Party.\n\n“The fact that its 3 counties outside of DC that decide for the entire state should be grounds for the rest of the state to secede. We have no representation,” a producer for the far-right TimCast posted, adding, “Many aren’t even born in America. They’re trying to enshrine foreign control with that degradation of voting integrity.”\n\nThat claim was quickly slapped down as another user pointed out that even if Northern Virginia counties, where a significant portion of Virginia’s population lives, had not voted in the 2025 election, Spanberger still would have won the race.\n\nSpanberger beat her opponent, former Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, by over 15 percentage points, or more than 520,000 votes, flipping the state from Republican to Democratic control in the commonwealth’s 2025 gubernatorial election.\n\nDespite their current outrage over Spanberger, Virginia Republicans heavily doubted Earle Sears’ candidacy, as she frequently unraveled during interviews, and Trump snubbed her in the high-profile race, withholding his endorsement.",

    "fullText": "A tense scene unfolded in Willowbrook after a federal agent opened fire during an immigration operation on Wednesday morning, prompting a large response from local and federal authorities.\n\nA federal agent opened fire while conducting an operation in the parking lot of an apartment building near the intersection of 126th Street and Mona Boulevard. No one was hit, but it triggered a large response from authorities as crowds of people gathered amid the chaos.\n\nShortly after 7 a.m., U.S. Border Patrol informed the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department that the agency was conducting an operation in the area, according to LASD. The shooting occurred shortly afterward.\n\nIn a statement provided to ABC7, the Department of Homeland Security said the targeted operation began in nearby Compton, \"to arrest a violent criminal illegal alien from El Salvador, William Eduardo Moran Carballo, who is involved in a human smuggling operation and has two prior arrests for inflicting corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant.\"\n\nAn immigration judge issued Carballo a final order of removal in 2019, according to DHS.\n\nDHS says Carballo tried to evade arrest around 7 a.m. on Wednesday and rammed his vehicle into law enforcement. That's when one of the agents fired at Carballo, missing him, and he was taken into custody.\n\n\"In a dangerous attempt to evade arrest, this criminal illegal alien weaponized his vehicle and rammed law enforcement,\" the Homeland Security statement read. \"Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired defensive shots. The criminal illegal alien was not hit and attempted to flee on foot. He was successfully apprehended by law enforcement. The illegal alien was not injured, but a CBP officer was injured.\"\n\nFurther details on the officer's injury were not provided.\n\nVideo provided to Eyewitness News by a neighbor shows the man leaving the apartment building, getting into his car and driving away. Seconds later, neighbors say Border Patrol tried to take him into custody, and that's when the shooting occurred.\n\nAlong with several federal agents in tactical gear, sheriff's deputies and California Highway Patrol officers responded to the scene.\n\n\"This situation is evolving, and more information is forthcoming,\" DHS said.\n\nMeanwhile, the FBI told ABC7 that the agency was not a part of the operation and said that an evidence response team was being sent to the scene.\n\nA large group of residents and activists gathered near the scene late Wednesday morning as more agents arrived, denouncing their presence.\n\nIncredibly tense situation in #compton right now. Residents and activists are confronting agents performing immigration enforcement @ABC7 pic.twitter.com/s1C0JXGwWz\n\n— Josh Haskell (@abc7JoshHaskell) January 21, 2026\n\nSome were seen holding Mexican flags and filming videos on their phone. At one point, the group was yelling at members of the sheriff's department.\n\n\"I saw the car crash... it was just crazy,\" said one resident who lives in the area. \"It's just crazy how they're coming over here and interrupting everybody's livelihood and their lives... this is just their lives.\"\n\nSome of the people who showed up are TikTokers who said they're working to be a voice for those who may be afraid.\n\n\"The federal ones... they like to come and go,\" said Angie Vargas, a local TikToker and live streamer. \"They like to move quick, so the fact that they're here and this incident happened, I think honestly, they came to the wrong city. A lot of us are out against what's going on, but yes, they are around our city, and I think there's a lot of us out here... supporting the community, being an extra set of eyes for them. That's why we're here. We're filming. We're bringing everything... the truth of what's going on, because there's a lot of people that are scared to come out and see what's going on.\"\n\n\"People are not going to work. They're causing disruptions. It's heartbreaking. It hurts. Why are you all here?\" said neighbor Andre Smith. \"I heard this is border patrol. If this is border patrol, ya'll need to go and patrol the border.\"\n\n\"It brings a lot of chaos to the kids, to people that have no citizenship. They're just here to work. That's why we're here to support our people,\" said Eric, whose family lives nearby. \"They've been taking people with citizenships just because of the color of our skin. We're tired of it already. We need them out of here.\"\n\nThere were some tense moments between the federal agents and protesters, but it appears no less-than-lethal rounds were fired and no protesters were arrested.",

    "fullText": "ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Federal immigration agents bashed open a door and detained a U.S. citizen in his Minnesota home at gunpoint without a warrant, then led him out onto the streets in his underwear in subfreezing conditions, according to his family and videos reviewed by The Associated Press.\n\nChongLy “Scott” Thao told the AP that his daughter-in-law alerted him on Sunday afternoon that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were banging at the door of his residence in St. Paul. He told her not to open it. Masked agents then forced their way in and pointed guns at the family, yelling at them, Thao recalled.\n\n“I was shaking,\" he said. “They didn't show any warrant; they just broke down the door.\"\n\nAmid a massive surge of federal agents into the Twin Cities, immigration authorities are facing backlash from residents and the local leaders for warrantless arrests, aggressive clashes with protestors and the fatal shooting of mother of three Renee Good.\n\n“ICE is not doing what they say they’re doing,” St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, a Hmong American, said in a statement about Thao's arrest. “They’re not going after hardened criminals. They’re going after anyone and everyone in their path. It is unacceptable and un-American.”\n\nThao, who has been a U.S. citizen for decades, said that as he was being detained he asked his daughter-in-law to find his identification but the agents told him they didn’t want to see it.\n\nInstead, as his 4-year-old grandson watched and cried, Thao was led out in handcuffs wearing only sandals and underwear with just a blanket wrapped around his shoulders.\n\nVideos captured the scene, which included people blowing whistles and horns and neighbors screaming at the more than a dozen gun-toting agents to leave Thao's family alone.\n\nThao said agents drove him “to the middle of nowhere\" and made him get out of the car in the frigid weather so they could photograph him. He said he feared they would beat him. He was asked for his ID, which agents earlier prevented him from retrieving.\n\nAgents eventually realized that he was a U.S. citizen with no criminal record, Thao said, and an hour or two later, they brought him back to his house. There they made him show his ID and then left without apologizing for detaining him or breaking his door, Thao said.\n\nHomeland Security defends the operation\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security described the ICE operation at Thao's home as a “targeted operation\" seeking two convicted sex offenders.\n\n“The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,” DHS said. “The individual refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID’d. He matched the description of the targets.”\n\nThao's family said in a statement that it “categorically disputes” the DHS account and “strongly objects to DHS’s attempt to publicly justify this conduct with false and misleading claims.”\n\nThao told the AP that only he, his son and daughter-in-law and his grandson live at the rental home. Neither they nor the property's owner are listed in the Minnesota sex offender registry. The nearest sex offender listed as living in the zip code is more than two blocks away.\n\nDHS later released the names and photos of two people it described as “violent illegal alien sexual offenders” that it was seeking to detain in St. Paul. Thao said he had never seen these men before and they did not live with him.\n\nDHS did not respond to an earlier request from The Associated Press asking why the agency believed they were present in Thao's home.\n\nThao's son, Chris Thao, said ICE agents stopped him while he was driving to work before they went to detain his father. He said he was driving a car he borrowed from his cousin's boyfriend, whose first name matches that of one of the men DHS said it was seeking. Chris Thao said he did not know the boyfriend's last name.\n\nFamily fled Laos after helping US\n\nThe family said they are particularly upset by ChongLy Thao’s treatment at the hands of the U.S. government because his mother had to flee to the U.S. from Laos when communists took over in the 1970s since she had supported American covert operations in the country and her life was in danger.\n\nThao's adopted mother, Choua Thao, was a nurse who treated CIA-backed Hmong soldiers in the U.S. government's “Secret War” from 1961 to 1975 against the communists, according to the Hmong Nurses Association website.\n\nChoua Thao, who passed away in late December, \"treated countless civilians and American soldiers, working closely with U.S. personnel,\" her daughter-in-law Louansee Moua wrote on a GoFundMe page for the family.\n\nChongLy Thao says he's planning to file a civil rights lawsuit against DHS and no longer feels secure to sleep in his home.\n\n“I don't feel safe at all,” Thao said. “What did I do wrong? I didn't do anything.”\n\nBrook is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

    "description": "Loan Huynh, an immigration attorney in Minneapolis, shared her advice for employers and employees as ICE continues heavy enforcement in the area.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Loan Huynh, an attorney who serves as the chair of the immigration department at Frederickson & Byron, a law firm based in Minneapolis. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThere's a huge concentration of ICE enforcement right now in Minnesota, specifically here in the Twin Cities. My law firm works with both employers and their employees.\n\nEmployees are very scared — they may be specifically being targeted by ICE, or they have family members or loved ones who are being targeted by ICE and they want to protect them, or they're just scared to be out in public.\n\nThe ICE action isn't just against individuals who are foreign nationals in Minnesota; it's against anyone who appears to be a foreign national, or anyone who's questioned and believed to be not cooperating with ICE — and there could be potential consequences, as we've seen.\n\nIt's a really difficult time for employers now, too. They're facing situations where they may have employees who can no longer work for them or who don't want to come to work, so they have to look at providing them with work-from-home options or other arrangements.\n\nICE is coming to their parking lots or places of business; we're getting questions from employers about how to ensure ICE doesn't have access to their spaces.\n\nWe know that this administration is taking a much broader interpretation of what rights they have in order to enforce immigration laws, and employers must be prepared for this.\n\nAs any law-abiding citizen or entity, you want to cooperate with law enforcement, but it doesn't mean that you don't have rights.\n\nThese are private properties that the businesses own, and businesses can restrict access.\n\nUnless there is some type of judicial order, warrant, or subpoena, there is no obligation for an employer to undertake enforcement activities or to perform the work of ICE activities here.\n\nIf you're communicating that they cannot enter your place of business — such as with a sign that says it's private property and there is no access to ICE — they don't have the right to do that.\n\nWe recommend that employers establish a protocol ahead of time about what they're going to do if ICE comes to their place of employment or contacts them about a specific employee.\n\nWe know now that it can happen; we're seeing it in Minnesota in ways we've never seen before.\n\nHere are questions that I think all employers in the US need to really need to address before that happens:\n\nEmployers should prepare early, before ICE comes to your neighborhood, to your place of employment, or to your city.\n\nIf ICE produces a judicial warrant asking for information or a subpoena about a certain individual, the employer should seek counsel to see what they must do in order to comply with it, whether it's right away or to inform ICE that they need additional time.\n\nIf ICE comes and says, \"I want to talk to this individual,\" and there's no warrant to allow that, an employer can respond, \"Thank you for the request. We will need to seek counsel in order to determine the next steps. We'll be happy to convey this information to the individual when we are able to.\"\n\nI was just on the phone with an employer about potential scenarios that they may face. I asked them, \"What do you plan to do if ICE comes to your parking lot and just parks there? How will you respond to that? Or if you get a call from one of your employees who says, 'I'm too scared to walk out of my car here. I see that there are ICE agents in the parking lot.'\"\n\nIt's so important for employers to prepare for any possible scenario, role-play, and determine, with their counsel, how they will respond to a request from a government agent or ICE.\n\nWe're seeing situations where an individual will say, \"I don't want to speak with you,\" or, \"I have counsel. Please contact my counsel,\" and the ICE agents continue to pressure them. They get very scared, and that's understandable, but please remember that you do have the constitutional right to be silent and not to speak to any investigator without counsel.\n\nWe have Know Your Rights information on our website. Everyone should know they have the right to choose whether to speak to a government agent. They have constitutional rights that, just because they are being threatened by an individual, don't mean that they have to succumb to those threats or requests.\n\nAre you a business owner or employee who's had an experience with ICE?

    "fullText": "AI technology is about to create two crises for every country, says the author of the bestselling book \"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, while giving a talk on AI and humanity at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Yuval Noah Harari said that AI is going to plunge humanity into an identity crisis, since we have come to value ourselves based on our capacity to think, but AI will potentially outperform us on this task soon.\n\nSecondly, Harari said every nation is going to face an immigration crisis, comparing AIs to immigrants who will bring benefits into a country, such as skills in medicine and teaching, but disruptions alongside those benefits.\n\n\"Those who are concerned about human immigrants usually argue that immigrants might take jobs, might change the local culture, might be politically disloyal. I'm not sure that's true of all human immigrants, but it will definitely be true of the AI immigrants,\" he said.\n\nHarari asked the audience whether they want to allow AIs to be recognized as \"legal persons\" with rights in their countries, giving them the ability to start businesses, form and preach their own religions, or befriend their children on social media.\n\n\"If you want to influence where humanity is going, you need to make a decision now,\" he said.\n\nHarari is a distinguished research fellow at the University of Cambridge's Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, and a history professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Alongside \"Sapiens,\" his book tracing human history across the centuries, he also released \"Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow\" in 2015, where he discussed the existential threat AI poses to humanity.\n\nHarari is not the first person to refer to \"AI immigrants.\" Earlier this month, the Nvidia CEO, Jensen Huang, referred to robots using the term, and said \"AI immigrants\" will help humans with work we no longer want to do, such as manufacturing jobs, AFP reported.",

    "description": "A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week's notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.  U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week's notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.\n\nU.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., concluded that the Department of Homeland Security didn't violate an earlier court order when it reimposed a seven-day notice requirement for congressional oversight visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.\n\nCobb stressed that she wasn't ruling on whether the new policy passes legal muster. Rather, she said, plaintiffs' attorneys representing several Democratic members of Congress used the wrong \"procedural vehicle\" to challenge it. The judge also concluded that the Jan. 8 policy is a new agency action that isn't subject to her prior order in the plaintiffs' favor.\n\nPlaintiffs' lawyers asked Cobb to intervene after three Democratic members of Congress from Minnesota were blocked from visiting an ICE facility near Minneapolis earlier this month — three days after an ICE officer shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis.\n\nLast month, Cobb temporarily blocked an administration oversight visit policy. She ruled Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week’s notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.\n\nA day after Good’s death, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem secretly signed a new memorandum reinstating another seven-day notice requirement. Plaintiffs’ lawyers from the Democracy Forward legal advocacy group said DHS didn't disclose the latest policy until after U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig initially were turned away from an ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building.\n\nOn Monday, Cobb ruled that the new policy is similar but different than the one announced in June 2025.\n\n“The Court emphasizes that it denies Plaintiffs’ motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge Defendants’ January 8, 2026 memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,” she wrote.\n\nDemocracy Forward spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said they were reviewing the judge's latest order.\n\n“We will continue to use every legal tool available to stop the administration’s efforts to hide from congressional oversight,” she said in a statement.\n\nTwelve other Democratic members of Congress sued in Washington to challenge ICE’s amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities. Their lawsuit accused Republican President Donald Trump’s administration of obstructing congressional oversight of the centers during its nationwide surge in immigration enforcement operations.\n\nA law bars DHS from using appropriated general funds to prevent members of Congress from entering DHS facilities for oversight purposes. Plaintiffs’ attorneys from the Democracy Forward Foundation said the administration hasn’t shown that none of those funds are being used to implement the latest notice policy.\n\n\"Appropriations are not a game. They are a law,\" plaintiffs’ attorney Christine Coogle said during a hearing Wednesday.\n\nJustice Department attorney Amber Richer said the Jan. 8 policy signed by Noem is distinct from the policies that Cobb suspended last month.\n\n“This is really a challenge to a new policy,” Richer said.\n\nPlaintiffs' attorneys said the matter is urgent because members of Congress are negotiating funding for DHS and ICE for the next fiscal year with DHS’s annual appropriations due to expire Jan. 30.\n\n“This is a critical moment for oversight, and members of Congress must be able to conduct oversight at ICE detention facilities, without notice, to obtain urgent and essential information for ongoing funding negotiations,” the lawyers wrote.\n\nGovernment attorneys have said it’s merely speculative for the legislators to be concerned that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week. But the judge rejected those arguments last month.\n\n“The changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,” wrote Cobb, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden.",

The federal investigation into his death continues.\n\nIt's the same facility where ICE said another detainee died earlier this month as staff members tried to keep him from killing himself. But a fellow detainee said at least five officers were restraining the handcuffed inmate and at least one had an arm around his neck.\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE — This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988.\n\nDiaz was swept up on Jan. 6 in the federal crackdown on immigration in Minnesota and sent to Texas, ICE said.\n\nDiaz entered the United States in March 2024 and Border Patrol officers took him into custody, He was released on parole pending a court date and a judge ordered him to leave the U.S. in an August hearing that Diaz did not attend, ICE said.\n\nDiaz was given a final order for removal on Jan. 12, two days before he was found unconscious in his room, authorities said.\n\nICE did not release any other details on Diaz's death. The agency notifies Congress and releases a statement on its website of all in-custody deaths.\n\nDiaz, 36, was being held at Camp Montana East where ICE said another detainee, Geraldo Lunas Campos, died as staff members tried to prevent him from killing himself.\n\nBut a preliminary investigation by the El Paso County Medical Examiner’s Office found Lunas Campos, 55, died from asphyxia from chest and neck compression and said the death would likely be classified a homicide.\n\nA fellow detainee told the AP that Lunas Campos was handcuffed and refused to go back into his cell when at least five guards pinned him to the floor. The detainee said at least one of the guards squeezed an arm around Lunas Campos' neck.\n\nICE said it is still investigating that death.",

    "description": "U.S. Army Reserve Black Hawk pilot Chris Busby, 28, and Stephanie Kenny-Velasquez, 25, went to an Austin courthouse to get their marriage certificate on Dec. 3.",
    "fullText": "U.S. Army Reserve Black Hawk pilot Chris Busby, 28, and Stephanie Kenny-Velasquez, 25, went to an Austin courthouse to get their marriage certificate on Dec. 3.\n\nRoughly 48 hours later, Velasquez entered a Houston Immigration and Customs Enforcement office for a routine check-in and never emerged, Busby said. The uncertainty has left the newlywed questioning whether his time serving the country was worth it, he said.\n\n“Stephanie is beautiful, she is smart, she’s amazing,” he said. “If it means sacrificing myself or my career to free her, I will do it.”\n\nBusby, who enlisted in the Army Reserve in 2015, has spent the last six weeks looking for ways to free his wife from detention. Despite his years of service and their recent nuptials, Velasquez was denied bond on Jan. 9, according to her lawyer.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment. The Department of Justice declined to comment on Velasquez’s case.\n\nVelasquez came to the United States in 2021 hoping to start a new life far from the violence and political instability of her native Venezuela. She does not have a criminal record and presented herself to immigration officials in Miami when she arrived in the country.\n\nIn the meantime, Velasquez, 25, settled into life in Austin. She picked up a job at a local car wash and took classes to get her real estate license.\n\nThe couple met in March and Busby, 28, immediately knew she was the one.\n\n“I’ve never met anyone like her,” he said. “She came here and just wanted to be the best.”\n\nTheir families had no idea that the couple planned to marry, and that’s how Busby said he wanted it. Busby said he was saving up money from his glass installation business to pay for a big wedding down the line.\n\nVelasquez had an asylum case pending at the time of her detention.\n\nHer brother, Oscar, described his younger sister as ambitious and driven. She hoped to start her own company one day and diligently saved money from working at the car wash and helping Busby with his window tinting business. She was studying for her real estate exam on the car ride to her immigration check-in, her husband said, adding that the test was scheduled for the following week.\n\n“She worked so hard for everything she had,” her brother said. “She was so happy.”\n\nBut on the day his sister was scheduled to check in with immigration officials, the family remained worried that Velasquez could be swept up in President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown despite her recent marriage and pending asylum case, he said.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have fled political repression and economic crisis in recent years, arriving in the United States seeking asylum or other legal protections like temporary protected status, or TPS.\n\nTrump moved to revoke TPS for many Venezuelans, which has been in place since 2023, and from other countries as part of his agenda to restrict immigration. That has been allowed to move forward while legal challenges to the action make their way through the courts.\n\n“We left to have a better future, more opportunities. Now if we go outside, we could be stopped by ICE,” Oscar said.\n\nLike other Venezuelans who have emigrated, Oscar said returning to Venezuela right now is unthinkable following the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. The country is far too dangerous and unstable for them to return, he said.\n\nVelasquez was transferred to the Montgomery Processing Center in Conroe, nearly three hours away from Austin. Since she entered detention her hair has thinned, Busby said. She sleeps fitfully in a bunk bed surrounded by 80 women, who share seven tablets to contact loved ones and lawyers, Busby said. They are allowed one visit per week and given food that is barely edible, he added.\n\nThe stress has taken a toll on Velasquez, according to her husband.\n\n“The girl is 25 years old. She should not be looking like she’s pushing 40,” Busby said.\n\nThe couple is now hoping for a Hail Mary in the form of the military’s Parole in Place program, which is intended to provide legal protections for spouses who lack U.S citizenship.\n\nBut the administration has slowly chipped away at the program, and a 2024 court ruling ended a Biden-era expansion called Keeping Families Together, which added stepchildren to the list of eligible relatives.\n\nA message on the initiative’s website said the Department of Homeland Security would no longer accept applications or adjudicate ones that were pending. The agency did not immediately respond to a request clarifying whether the Parole in Place program still applies to spouses.\n\n“I’m trying my hardest but there is so little I can do,” Busby said. “I just want her out of there.”\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "description": "A hacker published several data samples online, including one containing the personal information of Israeli nationals living in France. The French Office for Immigration and Integration (OFII) confirmed the theft, but said the breach was linked to a subcontractor.",
    "fullText": "Personal data belonging to foreign nationals residing in France was posted online on Thursday, January 1, by a hacker claiming the attack was for profit. Writing in a specialist discussion forum, the individual said the information was obtained by hacking the French Office for Immigration and Integration (OFII).\n\nThe hacker released two samples. The first contains the details of fewer than 1,000 foreign nationals, from countries including Ukraine, Cameroon, Afghanistan, and China. The other concerns 600 Israelis currently or previously residing in France. Each file sample includes names, first names, date of entry into France, the reasons and type of stay (employment, family, refugee status, etc.), as well as email addresses and phone numbers.\n\nContacted by Le Monde, the OFII confirmed a data theft but explained that the information came from a subcontractor of the organization. \"This is an intrusion that is not directly linked to OFII's information system,\" Director General Didier Leschi said. The stolen information concerns immigrants who have participated in a so-called contrat d'intégration républicaine (CIR, \"republican integration contract\"), a government-mandated program for those seeking to stay long-term in France. The contract includes citizenship and language courses.\n\nAccording to Leschi, a third-party \"operator\" with access to OFII data as part of the CIR was used to extract personal information, although it is not yet clear whether this subcontractor was hacked or was 'complicit' in hacking. \"We will be filing a complaint and sanctioning the operator involved, as well as tightening security requirements,\" Leschi added.\n\nFor now, the data does not appear to have been sold, but uncertainty remains over the exact number of people affected by the breach. The hacker claims to have obtained a file with 2 million entries, meaning potentially 2 million people, but claims made on forums specializing in the sale of stolen data should always be treated with caution.\n\nYou have 24.85% of this article left to read.

    "description": "ICE officer in Minneapolis have turned to stopping U.S. citizens, apparently at random, demanding identification and grilling them about their citizenship, residents who have recorded these encounters on video say.",
    "fullText": "The officers and agents the Trump administration has unleashed in Minneapolis and nearby communities have turned to stopping U.S. citizens, apparently at random, demanding identification and grilling them about their citizenship, residents who have recorded these encounters on video say.\n\nThe “show me your papers” encounters are showing up on social media and have even prompted podcaster Joe Rogan, a Trump backer in the 2024 campaign, to ask, “Are we really going to be the Gestapo?”\n\nOne man, Gage Diego Garcia, said he was held for six hours on Monday in Columbia Heights, Minnesota, after an encounter with officers that he told NBC News began when he was leaning into his friend’s car in an alleyway.\n\n“They came off pretty aggressive and asking for my ID. I refused because I had done nothing wrong,” Garcia said. He said that, as he started to blow a whistle draped around his neck, agents “got angry and grabbed him.”\n\nVideo recorded by a friend shows officers pushing Garcia onto the side of a car and pointing a Taser at him. The video does not show what happened before the officers grabbed Garcia. Garcia told NBC News later that officers grabbed him when he was trying to blow his whistle and an officer accused him of committing assault by spitting at him.\n\n“All I needed was your f---ing ID,” a masked officer said. Garcia responds to the officer using expletives. The officer responds, “You’re a f---ing b--- and you are gonna learn the f---ing hard way.”\n\nAs officers search his pockets, one finds his firearm, saying, “He has a gun on him! Look at that.” Garcia interjects, saying, “a fully registered firearm ‘cause I’m a U.S. citizen.” Later in the arrest, as the two argue, an officer is heard saying, “You are a f---ing citizen, you shouldn’t have done that.” It’s unclear what the officer was referring to when he said that.\n\nGarcia said that as he was being driven to the Whipple Building in Minneapolis, officers told him in response to his question that he was picked up because he looked like someone who committed a crime. “When I asked what crime, I was told, ‘we’ll figure it out,’” he said.\n\nHe also said officers told him, “I could have f---ing smoked you,” and that things “could have gone really south for you like those agents did to Renee Good.” Good was fatally shot last week by an officer who fired through her windshield as she drove forward on a Minneapolis street. She was a U.S. citizen.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said the media is “peddling a false narrative” and “attempting to demonize” law enforcement, which it says are being attacked and assaulted at significantly higher rates.\n\nDHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement emailed to NBC News that Garcia fled on foot when he saw the officers, “giving them reasonable suspicion.” She said Garcia became “extremely hostile” and alleged he physically assaulted one officer by spitting on his face. McLaughlin did not specifically address Garcia’s allegations regarding what officers said to him as he was being driven to the Whipple Building.\n\nMcLaughlin said the Fourth Amendment allows law enforcement to use “reasonable suspicion” to make arrests,” and that the Supreme Court recently affirmed its authority to do so.\n\nMcLaughlin was referring to a September 2025 Supreme Court ruling that allowed immigration officers to continue immigration patrols using race, ethnicity and language as factors in stopping individuals. Opponents have said it allows for racial profiling. McLaughlin said DHS “enforces federal immigration law without fear, favor or prejudice.”\n\nThe Fourth Amendment also protects individuals from unlawful search and seizure.\n\nDavid Schultz, an attorney and legal studies professor at Hamline University in St. Paul, said U.S. citizens do not have to provide identification or prove their citizenship when out walking or standing in a street or in public.\n\n“We have a First Amendment right of association, to be out on the street and we don’t have any requirement to have an ID,” Schultz said.\n\nIn one encounter Sunday, a woman was stopped and grilled about her citizenship while walking in her neighborhood. Nimco Omar of Minneapolis said she was confused when, as she started walking after parking her car, she heard commands for her to stop. Suddenly several people she thought were soldiers began running toward her.\n\n“I was like, what’s going on? Did I do something? Is something happening? Is it war?” she told NBC News in an interview in Minneapolis.\n\nShe said when she heard someone ask for her citizenship she realized they were immigration officers. Fearing she’d be “kidnapped,” she pulled out her phone to record the encounter.\n\nThe video shows a masked officer threatening to put her in a vehicle to ID her if she doesn’t provide identification. Omar calmly responds that she doesn’t need an ID to walk around her city and that she is a U.S. citizen, declining to provide her identification.\n\nThe officer continues to insist on identification and says, “We are doing an immigration check. We are doing a citizen check.” He repeatedly asks where she was born and informs her that if she’s lying about being a citizen, she can face federal charges.\n\nOther such encounters were recorded in Minneapolis.\n\nLast weekend, officers walked up to a man pumping gas and asked if he was a U.S. citizen, demanding to see documentation. The man responds, “I don’t have to show you.” As with Omar, the officer in this encounter states that the man can show him ID there or he can take him aside. The man provides what appears to be a license, but the officer continues to ask whether he is naturalized, where he was born and when he was naturalized. In another incident, officers questioned a man at a vehicle charging station.\n\nDHS did not provide information on the citizenship status of the people approached in these encounters.\n\nIn her statement, McLaughlin did not provide details about the incidents with Omar, the man pumping gas or the man at the vehicle charging station.\n\nThese are not the first such encounters. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said in December that her son was pulled over and asked about his citizenship. The Department of Homeland Security has said it has no record of the encounter.\n\nThe administration has sent about 3,000 officers and agents to Minneapolis, a city of 430,000. Much of the enforcement activity has taken place in south Minneapolis, where a federal officer fatally shot Good.\n\nSchultz advised that U.S. citizens who are stopped should keep their composure, as Omar did. They should ask why they are being stopped and they should ask if they are under arrest. If the officers say no, they should then ask if they are free to leave.\n\nHe said he would never turn over ID and “we don’t have any requirement in our society to prove who we are to walk the streets,” he said.\n\nWhen driving a car and if pulled over for probable cause, showing a driver’s license is required. But he said you are not required to say whether you are a citizen, though some states, not including Minnesota, have laws that allow authorities to question immigration status.\n\nShaquille Brewster and Kailani Koenig reported from Minneapolis, Colin Sheeley from New York and Suzanne Gamboa from San Antonio.\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A Cuban immigrant died in a Texas immigration detention facility earlier this month during an altercation with guards, and the local medical examiner has indicated that his death will likely be classified as a homicide.\n\nThe federal government has provided a differing account surrounding the Jan. 3 death of Geraldo Lunas Campos, saying the detainee was attempting suicide and staff tried to save him.\n\nA witness told The Associated Press that Lunas Campos died after he was handcuffed, tackled by guards and placed in a chokehold until he lost consciousness. The immigrant’s family was told by the El Paso County Medical Examiner’s Office on Wednesday that a preliminary autopsy report said the death was a homicide resulting from asphyxia from chest and neck compression, according to a recording of the call reviewed by the AP.\n\nThe death and conflicting accounts have intensified scrutiny into the conditions of immigration jails at a time when the government has been rounding up immigrants in large numbers around the country and detaining them at facilities like the one in El Paso where Lunas Campos died.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is legally required to issue public notification of detainee deaths. Last week, it said Lunas Campos, a 55-year-old father of four and registered sex offender, had died at Camp East Montana, but made no mention of him being involved in an altercation with staff immediately before his death.\n\nIn response to questions from the AP, the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, on Thursday amended its account of Lunas Campos’ death, saying he tried to kill himself.\n\n“Campos violently resisted the security staff and continued to attempt to take his life,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said. “During the ensuing struggle, Campos stopped breathing and lost consciousness.”\n\nIn an interview before DHS updated its account, detainee Santos Jesús Flores, 47, from El Salvador, said he witnessed the incident through the window of his cell in the special housing unit, where detainees are held in isolation for disciplinary infractions.\n\n“He didn’t want to enter the cell where they were going to put him,” Flores told the AP on Thursday, speaking in Spanish from a phone in the facility. “The last thing he said was that he couldn’t breathe.”\n\nAmong the first sent to Camp Montana East\n\nCamp Montana East is a sprawling tent facility hastily constructed in the desert on the grounds of Fort Bliss, an Army base. The AP reported in August that the $1.2 billion facility, expected to become the largest detention facility in the United States, was being built and operated by a private contractor headquartered in a single-family home in Richmond, Virginia. The company, Acquisition Logistics LLC, had no prior experience running a corrections facility.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the guards present when Lunas Campos died were government employees or those of the private contractor. Emails seeking comment on Thursday from Acquisition Logistics executives received no response.\n\nLunas Campos was among the first detainees sent to Camp Montana East, arriving in September after ICE arrested him in Rochester, New York, where he lived for more than two decades. He was legally admitted to the U.S. in 1996, part of a wave of Cuban immigrants seeking to reach Florida by boat.\n\nICE said he was picked up in July as part of a planned immigration enforcement operation due to criminal convictions that made him eligible for removal.\n\nNew York court records show Lunas Campos was convicted in 2003 of sexual contact with an individual under 11, a felony for which he was sentenced to one year in jail and placed on the state’s sex offender registry.\n\nLunas Campos was also sentenced to five years in prison and three years of supervision in 2009 after being convicted of attempting to sell a controlled substance, according to the New York corrections records. He completed the sentence in January 2017.\n\nLunas Campos’ adult daughter said the child sexual abuse accusation was false, made as part of a contentious custody battle.\n\n“My father was not a child molester,” said Kary Lunas, 25. “He was a good dad. He was a human being.”\n\nOn the day he died, according to ICE, Lunas Campos became disruptive while in line for medication and refused to return to his assigned dorm. He was then taken to the segregation block.\n\n“While in segregation, staff observed him in distress and contacted on-site medical personnel for assistance,” the agency said in its Jan. 9 release. “Medical staff responded, initiated lifesaving measures, and requested emergency medical services.”\n\nLunas Campos was pronounced dead after paramedics arrived.\n\nFlores said that account omitted key details — Lunas Campos was already handcuffed when at least five guards pinned him to the floor, and at least one squeezed his arm around the detainee's neck.\n\nWithin about five minutes, Flores said, Lunas Campos was no longer moving.\n\n“After he stopped breathing, they removed the handcuffs,” Flores said.\n\nFlores is not represented by a lawyer and said he has already consented to deportation to his home country. Though he acknowledged he was taking a risk by speaking to the AP, Flores said he wanted to highlight that “in this place, guards abuse people a lot.”\n\nHe said multiple detainees in the unit witnessed the altercation, and security cameras there should have captured the events. Flores also said investigators had not interviewed him.\n\nDHS did not respond to questions about whether Lunas Campos was handcuffed when they say he attempted suicide, or exactly how he had tried to kill himself.\n\n“ICE takes seriously the health and safety of all those detained in our custody,” McLaughlin said. “This is still an active investigation, and more details are forthcoming.”\n\nDHS wouldn’t say whether other agencies were investigating. The El Paso medical examiner’s office confirmed Thursday that it conducted an autopsy, but declined further comment.\n\nA final determination of homicide by the medical examiner would typically be critical in determining whether any guards are held criminally or civilly liable. When such deaths are ruled accidental or something other than homicide, they are less likely to trigger criminal investigations, while civil wrongful death lawsuits become harder to prove.\n\nThe fact that Lunas Campos died on an Army base could also limit state and local officials’ legal jurisdiction to investigate. An El Paso County District Attorney’s Office spokesperson declined to comment Thursday on whether it was involved in an investigation.\n\nThe deaths of inmates and other detainees after officers hold them face down and put pressure on their backs and necks to restrain them have been a problem in law enforcement for decades. A 2024 AP investigation documented hundreds of deaths during police encounters in which people were restrained in a prone position. Many uttered “I can’t breathe” before suffocating, according to scores of body camera and bystander videos. Authorities often attempt to shift the blame for such deaths to preexisting medical conditions or drug use.\n\nDr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist who has studied prone restraint deaths, said the preliminary autopsy ruling of homicide indicates guards' actions caused Lunas Campos’ death, but does not mean they intended to kill. He said the medical examiner’s office could come under pressure to stop short of calling it a homicide, but will probably “stick to its guns.”\n\n“This probably passes the ‘but for’ test. ‘But for’ the actions of the officers, he would not have died. For us, that’s generally a homicide,” he said.\n\n‘I just want justice, and his body here’\n\nJeanette Pagan-Lopez, the mother of Lunas Campos’ two youngest children, said the day after he died the medical examiner’s office called to inform her that his body was at the county morgue. She immediately called ICE to find out what happened.\n\nPagan-Lopez, who lives in Rochester, said the assistant director of the El Paso ICE field office eventually called her back. She said the official told her the cause of death was still pending and that they were awaiting toxicology report results. He also told her the only way Lunas Campos’ body could be returned to Rochester free of charge was if she consented to his being cremated, she said.\n\nPagan-Lopez declined and is now seeking help from family and friends to raise the money needed to ship his body home and pay for a funeral.\n\nAfter failing to get details about the circumstances surrounding his death from ICE, Pagan-Lopez said she got a call from a detainee at Camp Montana East who then put her in touch with Flores, who first told her about the altercation with guards.\n\nSince then, she said she has repeatedly called ICE, but is no longer getting a response. Pagan-Lopez, who is a U.S. citizen, said she also twice called the FBI, where an agent took her information and then hung up.\n\nPagan-Lopez said she and Lunas Campos were together about 15 years before breaking up eight years ago. She described him as an attentive father who, until his detention, had worked in a minimum-wage job at a furniture store, the only employment she said he could find due to his criminal record.\n\nShe said that in the family's last phone call the week after Christmas, Lunas Campos talked to his kids about his expected deportation back to Cuba. He said he wanted them to visit the island, so that he could stay in their lives.\n\n“He wasn’t a bad guy,” Pagan-Lopez said. “I just want justice, and his body here. That’s all I want.”\n\nAttanasio reported from Seattle, and Foley from Iowa City.\n\nContact the AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org or https://www.ap.org/tips/.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge in Minnesota on Thursday ordered the release of a Liberian man four days after heavily armed immigration agents broke into his home using a battering ram and arrested him.\n\nU.S. District Judge Jeffrey Bryan said in his ruling that the agents violated Garrison Gibson’s Fourth Amendment rights against unlawful search and seizure.\n\n“To arrest him, Respondents forcibly entered Garrison G.’s home without his consent and without a judicial warrant,” he said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has been ramping up immigration arrests in Minnesota in what the department has called its largest enforcement operation. DHS says its officers have arrested more than 2,500 people since Nov. 29.\n\nMarc Prokosch, Gibson’s attorney, said he was “thrilled” by the judge's order. He had filed a habeas corpus petition, used by courts to determine if an imprisonment is legal, and called the arrest a “blatant constitutional violation\" since the agents did not have a proper warrant.\n\nGibson’s wife was inside their Minneapolis home with the couple’s 9-year-old child during the raid. Prokosch said she was deeply shaken by the arrest.\n\nGibson, 37, was being held at an immigration detention center in Albert Lea after being held at a large camp on the Fort Bliss Army base in El Paso, Texas, according to ICE’s detainee locator.\n\nDHS did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press requesting comment on the order and has not responded to a prior email with follow-up questions about Gibson’s case.\n\nGibson, who fled the Liberian civil war as a child, had been ordered removed from the U.S., apparently because of a 2008 drug conviction that was later dismissed by the courts. He had remained in the country legally under what’s known as an order of supervision, with the requirement that he meet regularly with immigration authorities.\n\nOnly days before his arrest, Gibson had checked in with immigration authorities at regional immigration offices — the same building where agents have been staging enforcement raids in recent weeks.\n\nBryan said in his Thursday order that he agrees with Gibson's assertions that since he had already been released on an order of supervision, officials “violated applicable regulations” by not giving him enough notice that it had been revoked and the reasoning, as well as not providing him an interview right after he was detained.\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Homeland Security Department, had said that Gibson has “a lengthy rap sheet (that) includes robbery, drug possession with intent to sell, possession of a deadly weapon, malicious destruction and theft.” She did not indicate if those were arrests, charges or convictions.\n\nCourt records indicate Gibson’s legal history shows only the one felony in 2008, along with a few traffic violations, minor drug arrests and an arrest for riding public transportation without paying the fare.\n\nThe Twin Cities — the latest target in President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement campaign — has been wracked by fear and anger in the aftermath of the killing of Renee Good, who was shot Jan. 7 during a confrontation with agents. On Wednesday, a man was shot and wounded by an immigration officer who had been attacked with a shovel and broom handle.",

    "fullText": "A U.S. citizen on her way to a medical appointment in Minneapolis was dragged out of her car and detained by immigration officers, according to a statement released by the woman on Thursday, after a video of her arrest drew millions of views on social media.\n\nAliya Rahman said she was brought to a detention center where she was denied medical care and lost consciousness. The Department of Homeland Security said she was an agitator who was obstructing ICE agents conducting arrests in the area.\n\nThat video is the latest in a deluge of online content that documents an intensifying immigration crackdown across the midwestern city, as thousands of federal agents execute arrests amid protests in what local officials have likened to a \"federal invasion.”\n\nRahman said that she was on her way to a routine appointment at the Traumatic Brain Injury Center when she encountered federal immigration agents at an intersection. Video appears to show federal immigration agents shouting commands over a cacophony of whistles, car horns and screams from protesters.\n\nIn the video, one masked agent smashes Rahman's passenger side window while others cut her seatbelt and drag her out of the car through the driver's side door. Numerous guards then carried her by her arms and legs towards an ICE vehicle.\n\n“I'm disabled trying to go to the doctor up there, that's why I didn't move,” Rahman said, gesturing down the street as officers pulled her arms behind her back.\n\nRahman was caught in a “terrible and confusing position” and had “no where to go,” according to Alexa Van Brunt, Rahman's attorney and director of the MacArthur Justice Center.\n\n“Her only options were to move her car forward in the direction of ICE officers and risk being accused of trying to harm them—which led to Renee Good’s death—or stay stationary, which in the end led to physical violence and abuse,” Van Brunt wrote in a statement.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security disputed that account in an emailed statement on Thursday, saying that Rahman was an agitator who “ignored multiple commands by an officer to move her vehicle away from the scene.” She was arrested along with six other people the department called agitators, one of whom was accused of jumping on an officer's back.\n\nThe department did not specify if Rahman was charged or respond to questions about her assertion that she was denied medical treatment.\n\nBarrage of viral videos draw scrutiny\n\nThe video of Rahman's arrest is one of many that have garnered millions of views in recent days — and been scrutinized amid conflicting accounts from federal officials and civilian eyewitnesses.\n\nOften, what's in dispute pertains to what happened just before or just after a given recording. But many contain common themes: Protesters blowing whistles, yelling or honking horns. Immigration officers breaking vehicle windows, using pepper spray on protesters and warning observers not to follow them through public spaces. Immigrants and citizens alike forcibly pulled from cars, stores or homes and detained for hours, days or longer.\n\nIn one video, heavily armed immigration agents used a battering ram to break through the front door of Garrison Gibson’s Minneapolis home, where his wife and 9-year-old child also were inside. The video shot inside the home captures a woman’s voice asking, “Where is the warrant?” and, “Can you put the guns down? There is kids in this house.”\n\nAnother video shows ICE agents, including Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, detain two employees at a Target store in Richfield, Minnesota. Both are U.S. citizens who were later released, according to social media posts from family members.\n\nMonica Bicking, 40, was leaving the homeless shelter where she works as a nurse when she took a video that appears to show a federal agent kneeing a man at least five times in the face while several other agents pin him facedown on the pavement in south Minneapolis.\n\nBicking works full time, so she says she doesn’t intentionally attend organized protests or confrontations with ICE. But she has started to carry a whistle in case she encounters ICE agents on her way to work or while running errands, which she says has become commonplace in recent weeks.\n\n“We’re hypervigilant every time we leave our houses, looking for ICE, trying to protect our neighbors, trying to support our neighbors, who are now just on lockdown,” Bicking said.\n\nRahman said in her statement that after her detainment, she felt lucky to be alive.\n\n“Masked agents dragged me from my car and bound me like an animal, even after I told them that I was disabled,\" Rahman said.\n\nWhile in custody, Rahman said she repeatedly asked for a doctor, but was instead taken to the detention center.\n\n“It was not until I lost consciousness in my cell that I was finally taken to a hospital,” Rahman said.\n\nRahman was treated for injuries consistent with assault, according to her counsel, and has been released from the hospital.\n\nShe thanked the emergency department staff for their care.\n\n“They gave me hope when I thought I was going to die.”",

    "fullText": "Graduate international student enrollment at US universities is down after years of steady growth amid the Trump administration's immigration clampdown.\n\nThere were almost 10,000 fewer foreign students signing at the graduate level in fall 2025, a 5.9% decline from the year before, according to data released by the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. Meanwhile, a 3.2% increase at the undergraduate level added 5,000 students to the numbers coming from abroad, the data showed.\n\nCombined, international and domestic enrollments showed a slight increase. In total, there were 19.4 million postsecondary enrollments — 16.2 million undergraduate, and 3.2 million graduates — up from the 19.2 million enrollments the year before.\n\nInternational students are typically welcomed by school administrators because they often pay the full fees. However, in a post on X this week, the State Department said it had revoked 8,000 student visas as part of its mission to \"keep America safe.\"\n\n🚨BREAKING: The State Department has now revoked over 100,000 visas, including some 8,000 student visas and 2,500 specialized visas for individuals who had encounters with U.S. law enforcement for criminal activity.\n\nWe will continue to deport these thugs to keep America safe. pic.twitter.com/wuHVltw1bV\n\nThe State Department reopened student visa applications in June last year, having temporarily halted them.
