    "fullText": "A Kansas tribe said it has walked away from a nearly $30 million federal contract to come up with preliminary designs for immigrant detention centers after facing a wave of online criticism.\n\nThe Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation 's announcement Wednesday night came just over a week after the economic development leaders who brokered the deal with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement were fired.\n\nWith some Native Americans swept up and detained in recent ICE raids, the deal was derided online as “disgusting” and “cruel.\" Many in Indian Country also questioned how a tribe whose own ancestors were uprooted two centuries ago from the Great Lakes region and corralled on a reservation south of Topeka could participate in the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts.\n\nTribal Chairman Joseph “Zeke” Rupnick nodded to the historic issues last week in a video address that called reservations \"the government’s first attempts at detention centers.” In an update Wednesday, he announced that he was “happy to share that our Nation has successfully exited all third-party related interests affiliated with ICE.”\n\nThe Prairie Band Potawatomi has a range of businesses that provide health care management staffing, general contracting and even interior design. And Rupnick said in his latest address that tribal officials plan to meet in January about how to ensure “economic interests do not come into conflict with our values in the future.”\n\nA tribal offshoot hired by ICE — KPB Services LLC — was established in April in Holton, Kansas, by Ernest C. Woodward Jr., a former naval officer who markets himself as a “go-to” adviser for tribes and affiliated companies seeking to land federal contracts.\n\nThe Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation said in 2017 that Woodward’s firm advised it on its acquisition of another government contractor, Mill Creek LLC, which specializes in outfitting federal buildings and the military with office furniture and medical equipment.\n\nWoodward also is listed as the chief operating officer of the Florida branch of Prairie Band Construction Inc., which was registered in September.\n\nAttempts to locate Woodward were unsuccessful. A spokesperson for KPB said Woodward is no longer with the LLC but she declined to say whether he was terminated. Woodward did not respond to an email sent to another consulting firm he’s affiliated with, Virginia-based Chinkapin Partners LLC.\n\nA spokesperson for the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation said the tribe divested from KPB. While that company still has the contract, “Prairie Band no longer has a stake,” the spokesperson said.\n\nThe spokesperson said Woodward is no longer with the tribe's limited liability corporation, but she declined to say whether he was terminated.\n\nThe ICE contract initially was awarded in October for $19 million for unspecified “due diligence and concept designs” for processing centers and detention centers throughout the U.S., according to a one-sentence description of the work on the federal government’s real-time contracting database. It was modified a month later to increase the payout ceiling to $29.9 million.\n\nSole-source contracts above $30 million require additional justification under federal contracting rules.\n\nTribal leaders and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security haven’t responded to detailed questions about why the firm was selected for such a big contract without having to compete for the work as federal contracting normally requires. It’s also unclear what the Tribal Council knew about the contract.\n\n“That process of internal auditing is really just beginning,” the tribal spokesperson said.\n\nHollingsworth reported from Mission, Kansas, and Goodman from Miami.",

    "title": "Trump Administration Aims to Strip More Foreign-Born Americans of Citizenship",
    "description": "An official with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said it would prioritize “those who’ve unlawfully obtained U.S. citizenship.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration plans to ramp up efforts to strip some naturalized Americans of their citizenship, according to internal guidance obtained by The New York Times, marking an aggressive new phase in President Trump’s immigration crackdown.\n\nThe guidance, issued on Tuesday to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services field offices, asks that they “supply Office of Immigration Litigation with 100-200 denaturalization cases per month” in the 2026 fiscal year. If the cases are successful, it would represent a massive escalation of denaturalization in the modern era, experts said. By comparison, between 2017 and this year to date, there had been just over 120 cases filed, according to the Justice Department.\n\nUnder federal law, people may be denaturalized only if they committed fraud while applying for citizenship, or in a few other narrow circumstances. But the Trump administration has shown a zeal for using every tool at its disposal to target legal and illegal immigrants, leading activists to warn that such a campaign could sweep up people who had made honest mistakes on their citizenship paperwork and sow fear among law-abiding Americans.\n\nThe guidance comes as Mr. Trump has spent much of this year closing loopholes in the immigration system and throwing up roadblocks for people seeking to enter and stay in the country. The sweeping campaign, which has gone further than purging the country of unlawful migrants, has included blocks on asylum at the southern border, a pause on asylum applications inside the United States, and a ban on entry for travelers from predominantly African and Middle Eastern nations. Officials say their actions will make the country safer and preserve the country’s values\n\nA targeted campaign to increase the number of American immigrants stripped of their citizenship represents an escalation of an already ambitious campaign.\n\n“It’s no secret that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ war on fraud includes prioritizing those who’ve unlawfully obtained U.S. citizenship — especially under the previous administration,” said Matthew J. Tragesser, a U.S.C.I.S. spokesman. “We will pursue denaturalization proceedings for those individuals lying or misrepresenting themselves during the naturalization process. We look forward to continuing to work with the Department of Justice to restore integrity to America’s immigration system.”\n\nIn interviews, some former agency officials expressed concern at the scale of the case goals for denaturalization pushed by U.S.C.I.S. leadership.\n\n“Imposing arbitrary numerical targets on denaturalization cases risks politicizing citizenship revocation,” said Sarah Pierce, a former U.S.C.I.S. official. “And requiring monthly quotas that are 10 times higher than the total annual number of denaturalizations in recent years turns a serious and rare tool into a blunt instrument and fuels unnecessary fear and uncertainty for the millions of naturalized Americans.”\n\nProponents of stricter immigration laws said it was necessary to more aggressively root out people who had been improperly granted citizenship.\n\n“I don’t think we’re anywhere close to denaturalizing too many people,” said Mark Krikorian, the head of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors restrictive immigration policies. Mr. Krikorian said that the country was “so far from denaturalizing” enough people that such an effort would not pull in people who should not be targeted.\n\nThere are about 26 million naturalized Americans in the country, according to the Census Bureau. More than 800,000 new citizens were sworn in last year, most of whom were born in Mexico, India, the Philippines, the Dominican Republic or Vietnam, U.S.C.I.S. statistics show. Most people stripped of their citizenship revert to being legal permanent residents.\n\nThe new guidance on Tuesday was part of a document laying out U.S.C.I.S. priorities for the 2026 fiscal year, which began in October. Listed alongside such goals as “provide employee feedback opportunities” and “strengthen management of high-risk cases” was “pursue denaturalization.”\n\nThe Justice Department previously also said it would make denaturalization a priority this year. In a memo distributed in the summer, officials laid out their approach, saying they would target individuals in an array of categories beyond committing fraud in obtaining citizenship. Categories of eligible people include gang members, those who committed financial fraud, individuals connected to drug cartels and violent criminals, according to the department.\n\n“The civil division shall prioritize and maximally pursue denaturalization proceedings in all cases permitted by law and supported by the evidence,” the agency wrote in June.\n\nU.S.C.I.S. is a key player in the process of denaturalization. The agency refers cases to the Justice Department, which must go through a federal court to strip someone of their citizenship. The process can occur either through a civil or a criminal proceeding. During a civil case, government lawyers must have “unequivocal evidence” that someone obtained citizenship illegally or hid a material fact during the process.\n\nBecause the government must go through a challenging court process, denaturalization cases have been rare since the 1990s. A Bloomberg Law analysis found that denaturalization cases brought by the government since then peaked in 2018, when 90 criminal and civil cases were filed. “The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that citizenship and naturalization are too precious and fundamental to our democracy for the government to take it away on their whim. Instead of wasting resources digging through Americans’ files, U.S.C.I.S. should do its job of processing applications, as Congress mandated,” said Amanda Baran, a former senior U.S.C.I.S. official in the Biden administration.\n\nMr. Trump stepped up denaturalizations in his first term as well. In one widely publicized case, a New Jersey man born in India, Baljinder Singh, was stripped of his citizenship after the Justice Department found that he had arrived in the country without travel documents or proof of identity and that he had used a different name.\n\nThis year, the Justice Department has brought 13 denaturalization cases and won eight of them, according to Chad Gilmartin, an agency spokesman. Mr. Gilmartin said in a social media post earlier this year that there had been over 100 cases filed to the courts during the first Trump administration, compared with 24 during the Biden administration. In 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that the government must prove not only that someone had lied during the citizenship application process but that the lie had an impact on the underlying citizenship claim.\n\nExperts said that despite the ramp-up in referrals, the process to actually denaturalize someone would likely remain quite difficult, raising questions on whether the government will actually be able to get many cases through.\n\nStill, some had concerns about what the guidance could portend.\n\n“My fear would be that as we have seen in the arrest and removal context when D.H.S. employees are given arbitrary targets what happens is people who shouldn’t be swept up, get swept up and that you’re going to see that happening to people in this context as well,” said Margy O’Herron, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center, a nonpartisan law and policy organization. “That could incite fear and terror amongst naturalized citizens.”",

    "description": "These are the largest immigration groups in the U.S. and how they came here.",
    "fullText": "America has always been a nation shaped — and reshaped — by waves of immigration, but few eras have been as politically charged or emotionally fraught as the current moment. With record numbers of people arriving at the border, legal pathways in constant flux, and immigration dominating nearly every election-cycle debate, the question of who is coming to the United States — and how they are getting here — has become one of the country’s fiercest hot-button issues. Politicians weaponize it, communities feel its impact, and families live its consequences every day.\n\nBut behind the headlines, outrage, and policy battles lies a deeper, more human story: millions of people from around the world building lives, roots, and futures across the U.S. Their journeys are as diverse as their destinations — shaped by conflict, climate change, opportunity, and the promise that America still represents for so many. Understanding the largest immigrant groups in the country — and the routes, risks, and realities of how they arrived — offers a broader, clearer picture of the nation’s identity and the forces shaping its future.\n\nHere are the largest immigrant populations in the U.S. today — and the stories behind how they got here.\n\nMexican immigrants have long been the largest group of foreign-born residents in the U.S., making up a significant portion of the population. They often arrive through family reunification, employment opportunities, or seeking asylum from violence and economic hardship. Living predominantly in states like California, Texas, and Arizona, they have profoundly influenced American cuisine, music, and the labor market. While many face challenges such as legal hurdles and societal prejudice, their contribution to the U.S. is undeniable.\n\nThe Pew Research Center highlights that Mexican immigrants have increasingly become naturalized citizens, reflecting deeper integration into American society. This trend speaks to a growing commitment to establishing roots and participating in civic life. Despite political debates surrounding immigration policy, the Mexican community's resilience and adaptability continue to shape their American experience. They prove that while borders may separate lands, communities can build bridges through shared values and aspirations.\n\nIndia stands as the second-largest source of immigrants to the U.S., with many arriving on employment-based visas thanks to their high educational attainment. Indian immigrants often excel in fields such as technology, medicine, and academia, significantly contributing to these industries' growth. Silicon Valley, in particular, has seen a remarkable influence from Indian professionals, leading to a fusion of innovation and cultural exchange. Yet, beneath the surface of professional success lies the personal challenge of balancing dual cultures and identities.\n\nFor many Indian immigrants, community centers and cultural festivals provide a vital link to their heritage. These events offer a space to share traditions with younger generations and foster a sense of belonging. While adapting to a new country comes with its own set of hurdles, the Indian community’s strong family ties and cultural pride are central to their resilience. Their ability to integrate while preserving their rich cultural heritage is a testament to the enduring spirit of immigrants everywhere.\n\nChinese immigrants have a storied history in the U.S., dating back to the Gold Rush era, and continue to be one of the largest immigrant groups today. Many arrive through student visas, seeking education and the American Dream, while others come through employment-based channels. Major cities like New York and San Francisco host vibrant Chinatowns, which have become cultural landmarks offering a taste of China right in the U.S. These communities serve as a hub for new arrivals, providing familiar languages and customs in a foreign land.\n\nA study from the Migration Policy Institute notes that Chinese immigrants have seen a notable increase in family-based green cards, indicating a trend towards long-term settlement. This shift suggests a burgeoning commitment to building lives in America, complete with family and community. While they face significant challenges, such as navigating immigration laws and combating stereotypes, their journey is marked by perseverance and cultural exchange. The Chinese American narrative is one of blending tradition with modernity, crafting a unique identity within the American mosaic.\n\nThe Filipino community represents a significant portion of the immigrant population, with many arriving in the U.S. through family-sponsored visas and employment in healthcare and service industries. Their presence is particularly strong in states like California and Hawaii, where they have woven their cultural traditions into the American fabric. Filipino immigrants often bring with them a rich tapestry of cultural customs, from vibrant festivals to culinary delights, contributing to the multicultural landscape of the U.S. Despite the distance from home, strong familial bonds and a supportive diaspora network provide a safety net for many.\n\nFilipino immigrants frequently navigate the challenges of assimilation while maintaining ties to their heritage. The community often relies on faith and communal gatherings as pillars of support, helping to ease the transition into American life. With a high proficiency in English, Filipinos often integrate more smoothly into the workforce, though they still encounter obstacles such as wage disparities and discrimination. Their resilience and community-focused approach not only enrich their lives but also those of the broader American society.\n\nEl Salvadorans represent the largest Central American immigrant group in the U.S., many of whom have fled violence and economic instability. They predominantly settle in urban areas like Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., where robust communities have developed over the years. These immigrants often face the dual challenge of dealing with trauma from their home country while adapting to a new and sometimes unwelcoming environment. Despite these hurdles, the Salvadoran community is known for its strong work ethic and cultural pride.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Temporary Protected Status (TPS) has provided a lifeline for many Salvadorans, allowing them to live and work in the U.S. even if their immigration status is uncertain. This status has offered a sense of stability, although its future remains a political hot topic. The Salvadoran community's resilience is evident in their rich cultural expressions and community-building efforts. From vibrant pupuserías to cultural festivals, they contribute to the diverse tapestry of American life.\n\nVietnamese immigrants have established a significant presence in the U.S., many arriving as refugees following the Vietnam War. Over the decades, they have built thriving communities, especially in states like California and Texas. Vietnamese Americans have enriched the cultural landscape, with contributions ranging from cuisine to art and business. Yet, the journey to establishing these communities has been fraught with challenges, including overcoming language barriers and trauma from their war-torn past.\n\nCommunity support and family networks play a crucial role in the Vietnamese American experience. These immigrants often prioritize education and economic stability, with a strong focus on future generations. While they continue to navigate the complexities of identity and belonging, Vietnamese Americans have made indelible contributions to the cultural and economic fabric of the nation. Their story is one of perseverance, triumph, and the enduring American Dream.\n\nCuban immigrants have a unique immigration story, often driven by political factors, with many seeking refuge from communist rule. The Cuban American community has a prominent presence in cities like Miami, where they have significantly influenced local politics and culture. Cuban immigrants have historically benefited from favorable immigration policies, such as the Cuban Adjustment Act, which provided a pathway to legal residency. This facilitated their integration into American society, allowing them to become influential both economically and politically.\n\nThe Migration Policy Institute highlights that Cuban immigrants tend to have higher rates of naturalization compared to other Latin American groups. This has enabled them to wield considerable political power, particularly in Florida, where their votes can sway elections. Despite facing challenges such as cultural adaptation and generational divides, Cuban Americans continue to thrive. Their journey is marked by a profound love for both their homeland and their adopted country, reflecting the complex nature of immigrant identity.\n\nDominican immigrants have carved out vibrant communities across the U.S., particularly in New York City, where they form a significant part of the city's cultural mosaic. Many Dominicans come to the U.S. in search of better economic opportunities, often through family reunification or employment visas. Their influence is evident in the lively neighborhoods of Washington Heights and the Bronx, where Dominican culture is celebrated through music, dance, and cuisine. Yet, beneath the vibrant exterior lies the challenge of navigating racial and economic disparities.\n\nThe Dominican community places a strong emphasis on family ties and cultural heritage, often maintaining connections with relatives back home. This transnational identity shapes their American experience, influencing everything from business ventures to community activism. As they continue to tackle issues like immigration status and socioeconomic barriers, Dominicans in the U.S. remain steadfast in their pursuit of the American Dream. Their resilience and cultural pride are key components of their identity and strength.\n\nGuatemalan immigrants form a growing part of the U.S. immigrant landscape, with many fleeing violence and poverty in their home country. They often settle in states like California and Florida, where established communities offer support and resources. Their contribution to American society is most evident in sectors such as agriculture and construction, where they play a crucial role. However, Guatemalan immigrants often face significant challenges, including navigating complex immigration processes and overcoming language barriers.\n\nStrong community networks and a commitment to cultural preservation help Guatemalans maintain a sense of identity amidst the challenges of immigrant life. Cultural events and festivals serve as a reminder of their roots, offering a sense of belonging and unity. As they strive for better opportunities, Guatemalans continue to enrich the diverse American tapestry. Their journey is one of hope, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to building a better future.\n\nKorean immigrants have made significant strides in the U.S., establishing vibrant communities and contributing to various industries. Many Koreans arrive through employment-based visas or family sponsorship, settling in cities like Los Angeles and New York. Korean cultural influence is widely felt, from the global popularity of K-pop to the culinary delights of Korean barbecue. Yet, the path to integration is often marked by challenges such as navigating linguistic barriers and achieving economic stability.\n\nThe Korean American community places a high value on education, often pushing successive generations towards academic and professional success. This focus has led to a strong presence in fields like medicine, technology, and business. While they face challenges like racial discrimination and intergenerational gaps, their resilience and community solidarity are formidable. Korean Americans continue to be a vital part of the U.S. cultural and economic landscape, blending tradition with modernity in their pursuit of the American Dream.\n\nHonduran immigrants are part of the growing Central American presence in the U.S., often escaping violence and economic strife back home. Many settle in states such as Texas and Florida, where established communities provide a sense of familiarity and support. Hondurans contribute significantly to sectors like agriculture and service industries, bolstering the American economy with their hard work and dedication. However, the journey to stability is often fraught with obstacles, including the challenges of legal status and economic disparities.\n\nCommunity organizations and networks play a crucial role in supporting Honduran immigrants as they navigate their new lives. These groups offer resources and advocacy, helping to address issues like access to education and healthcare. Despite the challenges they face, Hondurans in the U.S. remain committed to building better futures for themselves and their families. Their stories are marked by hope, resilience, and the determination to overcome adversity.\n\nJamaican immigrants have a long history in the U.S., known for their vibrant culture and significant contributions to American music and sports. Many Jamaicans arrive through employment visas or family reunification, with a strong presence in cities like New York and Miami. Their cultural influence is profound, seen in the popularity of reggae music, jerk cuisine, and the achievements of figures like Usain Bolt. Yet, while they enrich the cultural landscape, Jamaican immigrants also grapple with challenges like racial discrimination and economic inequality.\n\nThe Jamaican community is characterized by its strong sense of identity and pride, often celebrating their heritage through festivals and community events. These gatherings offer a space to preserve culture and foster connections, providing support in navigating the complexities of immigrant life. As they continue to contribute to American society, Jamaicans demonstrate resilience and adaptability. Their story is one of cultural exchange, perseverance, and the enduring quest for the American Dream.\n\nColombian immigrants have established flourishing communities in the U.S., particularly in states like Florida and New York. Many Colombians come in search of better economic opportunities, fleeing violence and instability in their home country. Their influence is felt in various sectors, from business ventures to cultural festivals, adding to the rich tapestry of American society. However, the path to integration is often marked by challenges, including legal hurdles and economic disparities.\n\nCommunity support and cultural pride are central to the Colombian immigrant experience. Through vibrant events and traditions, Colombians maintain a connection to their heritage while navigating their new lives. Despite the obstacles they face, Colombians in the U.S. remain committed to building better futures for themselves and their families. Their resilience and cultural contributions continue to shape the American narrative, showcasing the enduring spirit of immigrants everywhere.\n\nHaitian immigrants form a vital part of the U.S. immigrant community, many arriving as refugees from political turmoil and natural disasters. They primarily settle in states like Florida and New York, where strong diaspora networks offer support and resources. Haitian culture is vividly expressed through art, music, and cuisine, enriching the American cultural landscape. Yet, the journey to stability is often challenging, with issues such as legal status and economic inequality posing significant hurdles.\n\nFaith and community play a crucial role in the Haitian American experience, providing a foundation for navigating the complexities of immigrant life. Churches and community organizations offer a sense of belonging and advocacy, helping Haitians address issues like housing and education. Despite the challenges they face, Haitians remain resilient and determined, contributing significantly to American society. Their story is one of perseverance, cultural pride, and the unyielding pursuit of the American Dream.\n\nBrazilian immigrants are an emerging presence in the U.S., drawn by economic opportunities and political stability. Many settle in states like Massachusetts and Florida, where vibrant communities offer cultural familiarity and support. Brazilian culture is celebrated through festivals, music, and cuisine, adding to the diverse American mosaic. However, the path to integration is often marked by challenges, including legal hurdles and cultural adaptation.\n\nCommunity support and cultural pride are central to the Brazilian immigrant experience. Through vibrant events and traditions, Brazilians maintain a connection to their heritage while embracing their new lives. Despite the obstacles they face, Brazilians in the U.S. remain committed to building better futures for themselves and their families. Their resilience and cultural contributions continue to shape the American narrative, showcasing the enduring spirit of immigrants everywhere.",

    "description": "One of the world's foremost economists, Lant Pritchett, has a plan.",
    "fullText": "Eva is a fellow on Fortune's news desk.\n\nA specter is haunting Europe—the specter of aging.\n\nMany Western countries are facing what the World Bank calls a “profound demographic crisis.” The twin perils of an aging population and record-low fertility rates are predicted to send their populations plunging in the coming decades.\n\nThe worst consequences of this demographic shift, per the World Bank, are economic. Soon the shrinking working population in the U.S., Canada, or Germany won’t be able to meet their own constant demands for high-quality goods and services. These rich, senescent countries will have to make a hard choice for economic survival: force people to work more, or allow immigrants to fill in?\n\nLant Pritchett, one of the world’s top thinkers on developmental economics, has seen this crisis coming for decades over his career at Harvard, the World Bank, and Oxford University, where he currently heads a research lab. He told Fortune his radical plan to stave off economic disaster.\n\nIn the long run, without intervention, the UN predicts a decline in population growth could cascade into a full-on population “collapse.” That collapse is not likely to occur until well into the next century—if it comes at all. However, in the short run, population decline presents a real and relatively simple economic problem: The West soon won’t have enough workers.\n\nThe ratio of working-age people to elderly people in rich countries will soon become so diminished that support for elders will be unaffordable. In Japan, a nation already facing the consequences of a graying population, the average cost of nursing care is projected to increase 75% in the next 30 years, with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida warning the nation is on “the brink.” In the U.S., think tanks have warned, an older population with more retirees means a shrinking tax base and higher demands on programs like Social Security and Medicare, along with a smaller number of working-age people to pay into those programs.\n\nIn short, we have a “ticking time bomb” on our hands, in the words of Greece’s Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, whose government introduced a six-day workweek last year to address the nation’s labor shortages. The move prompted fury and protests among workers as they watched their German and Belgian cousins embrace four-day workweeks.\n\nIndeed, even as some European countries and a few American companies flirt with working less, panicked economists and politicians are sounding the alarm: We need to work more. A study conducted by consulting firm Korn Ferry found by 2030, there will be a global human talent shortage of more than 85 million people, roughly equivalent to the population of Germany. That talent shortage could slash $8.5 trillion from nations’ expected revenues, affecting highly educated sectors such as financial services and IT as well as manufacturing jobs, which are considered “lower skilled” and require less education.\n\nNow is the time to act, economic veteran Pritchett told Fortune. But doing so involves some radical rethinking of the current immigration debate.\n\nClassical economics offers a number of ways to address a labor shortage, Pritchett said. Since most of the unfilled jobs are “unskilled,” or don’t require a degree to complete, one solution for businesses and governments is to invest in automation, essentially having robots fill the gap. But while automation helps get the jobs done, it depresses human workers’ wages by decreasing the number of jobs available, “exacerbating” the issue, Pritchett said.\n\nSome have called for increasing wages to induce more people to work. But most of the working-age population in the U.S. is already employed. Despite a well-documented decline in the portion of working-age men with jobs over the past few decades, Pritchett said the vast majority of working-age men are working, meaning raising pay would have small effects at best. There’s room for more women to work, he noted, but that could take away from other important responsibilities that are overwhelmingly shunted to women, such as caring for family or raising children.\n\nThat leaves two other options: forcing workers to work more or allowing an influx of legal, controlled immigration.\n\nMitsotakis’s plan for a six-day workweek is a step in the right direction for the short term, Pritchett said.\n\nBut “economics is not just about direction: It’s about magnitude,” he added. In other words, he says, small policy tweaks won’t do it. If we’re trying to address a big, structural problem with the U.S. labor force, the solution needs to be ambitious and comprehensive—precisely the type of legislation American politicians have largely avoided in recent years.\n\nIf policymakers simply try to make everyone work an additional day, the math simply won’t work out in the long run, Pritchett said. Even if Greece has “fantastic success” and increases its working hours by 10% over the next 30 years, that growth would represent a “drop in the bucket” in fighting a worsening labor shortage. He calculated a demographic labor force gap of 232 million people globally in his most recent paper, even assuming the highest possible labor force participation rate.\n\n“You can’t solve a problem that’s growing over time with [a labor force] that has an upward bound,” he said. You would have to keep the labor force working more and more, and even then, you would never be able to fill in the gap.\n\nPritchett has a better idea. He knows the current immigration debate is fraught, since the West is concerned with the social ramifications of allowing more migrants into its borders. But he maintains the only way to solve rich countries’ labor problem is to let in immigrants to work, particularly from countries where population growth is increasing, such as Nigeria or Tanzania, rather than decreasing.\n\nIn his view, the Western debate on immigration has taken on an unnecessarily binary flavor, with the choice depicted as one between a path to citizenship or closed borders. In an article titled “The political acceptability of time-limited labor mobility,” Pritchett says the West will soon have to abandon this view. Instead, he advocates for developed nations to embrace a system where immigrants can come to their country to work for a limited time—while also buying goods and services, renting homes, starting companies, and hiring workers—and then go back home, leaving both parties wealthier.\n\nThe truth, Pritchett said, is the U.S. needs low-skilled migrants, and many migrants need the economic boost from working in the U.S. Immigration is a symbiotic relationship that the West cannot quit—that’s why it’s so hard for us to actually control our borders.\n\n“The way to secure the border is to create a legitimate way for people and firms to get the labor that the economy really needs in legitimate, legal ways, and until we have that, the whole debate over the wall and stuff is just silly,” Pritchett said.\n\nIf anything, the intensifying crackdown on undocumented and legal migration since the late 1980s has led to mass settlement, according to Hein de Haas, a sociologist of immigration. Prior to the 1980s, the U.S. and Mexico enjoyed a relationship similar to the work-visa program Pritchett envisions. Mexicans freely flowed across the border, coming for a short time to work, returning home to enjoy their money, and sometimes repeating this journey over several years, Haas wrote. They never permanently settled because, knowing they could come and go as they pleased, they did not have to.\n\nThe U.S. facilitated this temporary migration programs specifically aimed at Mexicans,  encouraging contract workers to come to the U.S. after  World War I and II. The second of these, the Bracero Program, established a treaty for the temporary employment of Mexican farmworkers in the U.S., and was so popular that it was extended far beyond its initial life span, allowing nearly 5 million Mexicans to temporarily work in the U.S. from 1942 to 1964. (The program ended in 1965, when the U.S. sharply limited immigration from Latin America as part of a major overhaul of immigration laws.)\n\nWhat Pritchett suggests isn’t too dissimilar from simply turning the clock back to a time when migrants could move and work freely. He proposes a fixed-term system: A worker comes to the U.S. with the understanding that they are not on a path to citizenship, works on a three-year contract, and then returns to their home country. After an “off period” of six months to a year, the migrant could come back for another three years.\n\n“There are a billion people on the planet who would come to the U.S. under those terms,” Pritchett said. “But we don’t have that available.”\n\nHe isn’t exaggerating about the billion. In a 2010 survey, Gallup asked people around the world whether they would like to temporarily move to work in another country. Some 1.1 billion responded “yes,” including 41% of the age 15-to-24 population and 28% of those ages 25-44, Pritchett said.\n\n“What you could make in America in three years and go back to Senegal with is a fortune compared to anything else you could do to make your way in Senegal,” he added. “You go back to Senegal, you build a house, you buy your own business, and you’ve transformed your life by working temporarily.”\n\nTo avoid potential labor shortages in sending nations, Pritchett’s system would depend on bilateral agreements between the host and sending countries, and nations “could choose to put limits on their participation” to address their own labor needs, Pritchett said.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. would receive fresh batches of workers for service industries, elderly care, or manufacturing—essentially, all the jobs that would be otherwise unfilled.\n\nPolicies like these are not yet being discussed on the national stage, but Pritchett believes that will soon change. With the upcoming labor shortage and the unpopularity of forcing workers to toil for longer, politicians will have to expand their understanding of immigration to allow for policies like his. For now, he’s planting the seed.\n\nIn partnership with economist Rebekah Smith, Pritchett has started an organization called Labor Mobility Partnerships (LaMP) that aims to build political support for a temporary rotational migration system. The way he sees it, nothing will change by pitching the idea to politicians (“who tend to be followers, not leaders”) so instead, he is working with countries that are currently already expanding their immigration channels, like Spain.\n\nHe is also courting business leaders in sectors that will be the hardest hit by labor shortages, such as elderly care, who could “be potentially a powerful force” in explaining to politicians why policies like his are necessary.\n\n“Ideas at times are like dams: huge, unmoving, impregnable, able to hold the water back forever,” Pritchett writes in the conclusion of his paper. “But a small, strategically placed crack can cause a dam to be washed away overnight.”\n\nA version of this story was published on Fortune.com on Aug. 4, 2024.",

    "fullText": "CASABLANCA, Morocco (AP) — Exposure to freezing temperatures near Morocco’s border with Algeria killed nine African migrants, a tragedy that rights groups in the North African country called deeply concerning and a violation of the right to freedom of movement.\n\nThe bodies of seven men and two women were found in Ras Asfour, a remote mountainous Moroccan area known for its plunging temperatures in winter, the Moroccan Association of Human Rights said Saturday in a statement.\n\n“They died from extreme cold, which their exhausted bodies could not withstand,” it said.\n\nOne of the migrants was from Guinea, the group said. The rest were from various countries throughout sub-Saharan Africa, though specific information about their identities remains unknown. Morocco’s Interior Ministry did not immediately respond to questions about the individuals who died.\n\nEvery year, thousands of migrants seeking better living conditions attempt to crossing illegal from North Africa to Europe, including from Morocco to Spain. Some aim for Ceuta and Melilla – two tiny Spanish enclaves in North Africa – by scaling border fences or swimming. Others attempt to reach Spain’s Canary Islands, taking a longer route through the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe North African nation’s security forces regularly report blocking such attempts.\n\nThroughout Europe and Africa, North Africa is known as a transit point for migrants en route to Europe’s southern border.\n\nSecurity agreements with the European Union have strengthen authorities' ability to deter migration in North Africa. Many who originally intended to migrate to Europe spend months or years working informally — doing construction, agriculture or domestic work. Others rely on aid while waiting for opportunities to cross the Mediterranean Sea or Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe Moroccan Association of Human Rights statement said six of the bodies were buried last week and two were kept at the request of their relatives. “We will make sure that this case is followed up on,” it said.\n\nThe Moroccan Organization of Human Rights — a different association — earlier this week called for the humanization of borders, the decriminalization of illegal migration and residence, and the creation of a mechanism to track missing migrants to prevent tragedies like the one in Ras Asfour.\n\nFollow AP’s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",

    "fullText": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia must be freed from immigration detention while he fights his deportation, a judge ruled Thursday, handing a major victory to the immigrant whose wrongful deportation to a notorious prison in El Salvador made him a flashpoint of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement to let Abrego Garcia go immediately, writing that federal authorities had detained him again after his return to the United States without any legal basis.\n\n“For this reason, the Court will GRANT Abrego Garcia’s Petition for immediate release from ICE custody,” the judge wrote.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security sharply criticized the decision and vowed to appeal, calling the ruling “naked judicial activism” by a judge appointed during the Obama administration.\n\n“This order lacks any valid legal basis, and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary. The judge gave prosecutors until 5 p.m. EST to formally respond to the release order.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment, and messages seeking comment from Abrego Garcia’s attorney were not immediately returned.\n\nAbrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national with an American wife and child, has lived in Maryland for years but entered the U.S. illegally as a teenager. An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that he could not be deported to El Salvador because he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family. When he was mistakenly sent there in March, his case became a rallying point for those who oppose President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement actions.\n\nA court later ordered his return to the United States. Since he cannot be removed to El Salvador, ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries. His federal suit claims the Trump administration is illegally using the removal process to punish Abrego Garcia for the public embarrassment caused by his deportation.\n\nIn her order releasing Abrego Garcia, Xinis wrote that federal authorities “did not just stonewall” the court, “They affirmatively misled the tribunal.” The judge was referencing the successive list of four African countries that officials had sought to remove Abrego Garcia seemingly without commitments from those countries, as well as officials' affirmations that Costa Rica withdrew its offer to accept him, a claim later proven untrue.\n\n“But Costa Rica had never wavered in its commitment to receive Abrego Garcia, just as Abrego Garcia never wavered in his commitment to resettle there,” the judge wrote.\n\nXinis also rejected the government’s argument that she lacked jurisdiction to intervene on a final removal order for Abrego Garcia, because she found no final order had been filed.\n\nSeparately, Abrego Garcia is asking an immigration court to reopen his case so he can seek asylum in the United States.\n\nHe is also criminally charged in Tennessee, where he has pleaded not guilty to human smuggling. He has asked the federal court to dismiss the case, arguing the prosecution is vindictive. His defense attorney in Tennessee, Sean Hecker, declined to comment.\n\nA judge in that case has ordered an evidentiary hearing after previously finding some evidence that the charges “may be vindictive.” The judge also noted several statements by Trump administration officials that “raise cause for concern,” including a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that seemed to suggest the Justice Department charged Abrego Garcia because he won his wrongful deportation case. ___\n\nLoller reported from Nashville, Seewer reported from Toledo, Ohio and Lauer reported from Philadelphia.

    "description": "Amanda...",
    "fullText": "In a text exchange, Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino calls his operation a “massive disturbance” in the making.\n\n“Operation Catahoula Crunch is making New Orleans safer by finding and arresting illegal aliens who have been endangering this community,” Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino posted on X shortly after his roving corps of immigration enforcers arrived in the city. In a similar PR offensive, the Department of Homeland Security recently launched the “Worst of the Worst” website, which features some of the arrests that the federal agents implementing the Trump White House’s mass deportation policy have carried out across the country. (The legal resolution of these arrests, like the 13 cases dropped in court after Bovino’s Operation Midway Blitz campaign in Chicago, are not featured.)\n\nAnd despite the online efforts to portray the Trump raids as heroic peacekeeping exercises, Commander Bovino’s New Orleans team seemed to be operating by a different set of rules, to judge by its conduct this past Saturday. A caravan of Louisiana state troopers escorted three rental cars full of federal agents, including Bovino himself, to an apartment complex in Kenner, Louisiana. A secondary caravan, made up mostly of journalists and protesters, followed close behind. State police blocked off a road in the complex, driving both groups out of their vehicles and into the street, where Bovino and his agents could move in on them. The federal agents slowly drove down the road, stopping for minutes at a time. The small group of protesters grew, bolstered by neighbors who lived in the apartments.\n\nSafe inside an SUV, surrounded by agents with weapons, Bovino texted away on his phone from the parking lot of an apartment complex. The messages, recorded by journalist Ford Fischer, offer some insight—into both Bovino’s mind and the state of the Louisiana operation.\n\n“Kind of cool we are a massive wrecking crew. The idiots can’t do anything to us…. I can’t understand why DHS is hiding us when we are handing them strategy on a silver platter,” Bovino wrote to a contact listed as “Diz.” Minutes later, Bovino followed up with a summary of their on-the-ground strategy that afternoon: “Massive disturbance at apartment complex in Kenner. We are running tags and such.”\n\nThe “disturbance” was hardly massive. The protesters were yelling at the agents as they sat in their vehicles with the windows up, but they didn’t offer any physical resistance. After running the tags of the cars down the length of the road, Border Patrol agents got out and knocked on a door. The sound of whistles pierced the air, and one loud protester yelled out for his neighbors not to open their doors: “They cannot come in if you do not give them verbal, allowed permission.”\n\nThe stunt seemed to be a way to agitate the neighborhood more than anything else. And the photos showing Bovino’s messages cast the operation’s alleged legal aims into further doubt. Just for starters, why would a targeted enforcement operation rely on running tags in the parking lot of an apartment complex located in the town with the highest Hispanic population in the state of Louisiana? This seemed to be a “Kavanaugh stop”—the practice of racially profiling residents recently sanctioned by the US Supreme Court—running on steroids.\n\nBovino’s reference to the DHS’s “hiding” his team raises further questions. It certainly seems at odds with his constant media appearances, and his photo-ops in the snack aisles of gas stations\n\nPerhaps Bovino was simply venting because the New Orleans raids aren’t producing the kind of strong-arm spectacle that he’s staged in Chicago and elsewhere. According to the Associated Press, his team has carried out just 38 arrests over the first four days of Operation Catahoula Crunch. And of the 38 people detained, only nine had criminal records—a percentage that’s generally in line with the national numbers for the immigration raids, which show that more than 70 percent of the people arrested had no criminal convictions.\n\nBovino’s texting partner, at least, seemed to be mindful of the team’s lackluster show of force. “You need to do interviews. Fox and friends wants you. We will come up for a talking point on the low numbers,” Diz texted Bovino.\n\nStill, when he doesn’t feel like he’s being hidden, Commander Bovino remains stoutly on message. “The Big Easy is the Big Hard for illegal aliens,” Bovino bragged this week on X.\n\nOver the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T. Klare, Katha Pollitt, Amy Littlefield, Gregg Gonsalves, and Sasha Abramsky take on the Trump family’s corruption, set the record straight about Robert F.

That means that your contribution will be doubled, dollar for dollar. If we hit the full match, we’ll be starting 2026 with $150,000 to invest in the stories that impact real people’s lives—the kinds of stories that billionaire-owned, corporate-backed outlets aren’t covering.\n\nWith your support, our team will publish major stories that the president and his allies won’t want you to read. We’ll cover the emerging military-tech industrial complex and matters of war, peace, and surveillance, as well as the affordability crisis, hunger, housing, healthcare, the environment, attacks on reproductive rights, and much more. At the same time, we’ll imagine alternatives to Trumpian rule and uplift efforts to create a better world, here and now.\n\nWhile your gift has twice the impact, I’m asking you to support The Nation with a donation today. You’ll empower the journalists, editors, and fact-checkers best equipped to hold this authoritarian administration to account.\n\nI hope you won’t miss this moment—donate to The Nation today.\n\nEditor and publisher, The Nation",
