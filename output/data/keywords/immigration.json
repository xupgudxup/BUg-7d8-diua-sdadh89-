    "fullText": "Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Maine arrested an asylum-seeker and hauled him away, leaving behind his one-month-old baby and wife, who does not have a driver’s license.\n\nThe Portland Press Herald reported on Wednesday that on Jan. 21, Hassane Barry and his wife, Nene Barry, who are asylum-seekers from Guinea, were on their way home from an appointment to obtain a passport for their baby. But Hassane Barry never made it home, as his car was abruptly boxed in by four unmarked vehicles.\n\nThe Press Herald described the arrest:\n\nArmed and masked federal agents stepped out and said Hassane’s name. They were here for him.\n\n“There’s a baby in the car,” Barry told the agents. “There’s a baby.”\n\nAgents shattered his driver’s side window. Glass sprayed over the baby’s car seat, Nene Barry said. Her husband was arrested and pulled into an unmarked police car. Officers left the scene in a matter of minutes.\n\nNene Barry, who does not have a driver’s license and speaks little English, was left alone inside the car with her infant.\n\n“He did everything for us, and now he’s not here. What am I going to do alone with a 1-month-old baby in the cold?” Nene Barry said in an interview this week in French.\n\nVideo given to the Press Herald shows the aftermath of the incident. Shards of glass littered the street and the interior of the car. “I have a baby,” Nene Barry repeated in broken English.\n\n“There was a car seat in the back with one of those baby blankets you get at the hospital. There were broken glass shards all over it,” one witness told the paper, on condition of anonymity due to concerns for their safety. “I carefully pulled back the blanket and there was just this tiny peanut of a baby. He was crying.”\n\nHassane Barry, 38, has no known criminal record, his attorney said, and a search for a criminal history yielded no results. His English tutor told the Press Herald that Barry worked as a tow truck driver for AAA and worked as a ride-share driver on the side. At last check, Barry was being held at a detention facility in Plymouth, Massachusetts.\n\nNene Barry said she is afraid to leave her home, and has left just once, to bring her son to a medical appointment.\n\nThe arrest comes amid the Trump administration’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants, as well as immigrants who are in the country legally.\n\nLast week, an ICE agent in Portland went viral after he was filmed telling a woman that she was going into a “database” for “domestic terrorists” for daring to film him in public.\n\nThe post ICE Agents Shatter Car Window After Being Told ‘There’s a Baby’ Inside, Haul Asylum-Seeking Father Away first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "A Nicaraguan man who died at a troubled Texas detention camp days after he was detained by immigration agents in Minnesota appeared to have died by suicide, according to a 911 call and records released Wednesday.  Victor Manuel Diaz, 36, was found by guards on Jan. 14 in a room at Camp East Montana in El Paso, Texas, after he tried to die by suicide, a camp official reported on a 911 call obtained by The Associated Press through a public information request.  “They were doing rounds and they just found him with his pants tied up to his neck, I believe,” said the caller, who identified himself as a health administrator named Luis Gonzalez.",
    "fullText": "Victor Manuel Diaz, 36, was found by guards on Jan. 14 in a room at Camp East Montana in El Paso, Texas, after he tried to die by suicide, a camp official reported on a 911 call obtained by The Associated Press through a public information request.\n\n“They were doing rounds and they just found him with his pants tied up to his neck, I believe,” said the caller, who identified himself as a health administrator named Luis Gonzalez.\n\nDiaz’s death was at least the third of a detainee housed at Camp East Montana, which opened last year at Fort Bliss to hold 5,000 detainees in the desert near the U.S.-Mexico border. Advocates for detainees have alleged a pattern of violence, abuse and neglect at the camp. One earlier death has been ruled a homicide.\n\nRandall Kallinen, an attorney for Diaz's family, said they are suspicious of the claim that his death was a suicide because he was not depressed and would have been reunited with his mother, two sons and siblings in Nicaragua if he had been deported.\n\n“Even if it is suicide, was there something that happened to him that drove him to suicide?” Kallinen asked. “There still has to be an investigation.”\n\nMessages seeking comment were left with ICE on Wednesday.\n\nGonzalez did not witness Diaz's suicide attempt. A separate report by emergency medical services that was released Wednesday said Diaz was suspected of hanging himself with a bed sheet. Federal authorities have not released the findings of an autopsy, but have said the death was a “presumed suicide.”\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement picked up Diaz on Jan. 6 as agents fanned out across Minneapolis looking for people who may be in the country illegally. He was then sent to the sprawling Texas tent complex.\n\nDiaz crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in 2024, requested asylum and was released. A judge later ordered his removal after he didn’t show up for an immigration hearing, according to ICE.\n\nRelatives in Nicaragua lost contact with Diaz after he went to work at a suburban restaurant on Jan. 6 and later learned he'd been detained. They received a call on Jan. 15 from ICE saying Diaz was dead. Family members “were in disbelief,” said Carlos Morales, board president of Texas Nicaraguan Community, a nonprofit that helped the family raise money to repatriate Diaz's remains to Nicaragua.\n\nA coalition of groups and a Democratic congresswoman who represents El Paso have called for Camp East Montana to be closed.\n\nSome of those calls came after the Jan. 3 death of 55-year-old Cuba native Geraldo Lunas Campos. A medical examiner has ruled that a homicide, citing physical restraint by guards.\n\nA witness has described guards pinning Lunas Campos to the ground in handcuffs, with one restraining him in a chokehold until he could no longer breathe. ICE has said the guards intervened to try to help Lunas Campos after he attempted suicide, and that he resisted them. A camp official initially told police it was a suicide.\n\nLawyers for the family of Lunas Campos have asked a judge for an emergency order to prevent ICE from deporting detainees who witnessed the struggle.\n\nICE, which oversees the camp, announced Diaz’s death on Jan. 18, saying security staff “found Diaz unconscious and unresponsive in his room.” The agency said he “died of a presumed suicide” but that the cause was still under investigation.\n\nIn addition to Lunas Campos and Diaz, ICE announced that on Dec. 3 an immigrant from Guatemala held in Camp East Montana died after being transferred to a El Paso hospital for care. The agency said Francisco Gaspar-Andres, 48, was suspected to have died of liver and kidney failure.\n\nUnlike with the two prior deaths, Diaz’s body wasn’t sent to the county medical examiner in El Paso for an autopsy. Kallinen said an Armed Forces pathologist conducted the autopsy at Fort Bliss, and that he's been told it could take months for findings to be released.\n\nThe 911 caller in the case told the dispatcher that a team of doctors and nurses were working to try to revive Diaz after his suicide attempt and they needed an ambulance.\n\nParamedics found him laying on his back in a hospital bed without a heartbeat, according to an El Paso Fire Department incident report.\n\nAP reporter Michael Biesecker contributed from Washington.",

    "description": "Some small-business owners in Portland, Maine, are debating how best to support staff and customers amid a federal immigration crackdown.",
    "fullText": "After Andy Gerry and his business partners put a \"No ICE\" sign in the window of their lobster roll shop in Portland, Maine, backlash followed quickly.\n\nGerry said dozens of bad reviews flooded the restaurant last week after lists circulated online of area businesses that had hung \"No ICE\" posters following the federal government's announcement that it would increase immigration enforcement in the state.\n\nFor Gerry and his co-owners at The Highroller Lobster Co., it was one more challenge of running a small business.\n\n\"The posters are up, and they're not coming down,\" Gerry said.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with a half-dozen local business owners, including Gerry, about their decision to take a stance on immigration agents' presence in Portland, including whether to post signs.\n\nAlso on the table: Should they go along with calls for shutting businesses and schools on Friday as part of what organizers hope will be a nationwide campaign.\n\nGerry said that some owners he's been speaking with favor taking part in the stoppage, and others are calling for businesses to remain open to divert profits to groups helping immigrants.\n\nAlready this week, Gerry said, he's flip-flopped over whether to keep the restaurant open on Friday. His current thought: Close for the day and donate weekend proceeds to charities helping those affected by the immigration sweep.\n\nThese are the sorts of calculations that many small-business owners across the US have considered over the past few months. The question has felt especially urgent lately in Portland, a seaside city of about 70,000, where immigration officials have had a more visible presence over the past week.\n\nWhile some of corporate America's top executives have weighed in with statements about the immigration actions, some small-business owners — answering phones and facing customers directly — are making personal choices about whether to publicly take action.\n\nSome workers and owners at more than a dozen businesses Business Insider visited didn't want to discuss the immigration issue because they said it didn't pertain to their day-to-day operations. Others said they didn't want to upset neighboring businesses or draw attention.\n\nGerry said he saw putting up the sign, created by a Portland artist, as a way to amplify his staffers' voices and support anyone who might be fearful of getting caught up in the immigration sweep.\n\nHe said he contacted restaurant review sites to flag the negative ratings, and he and his co-owners instructed the restaurant's more than 50 staffers on how to handle negative phone calls. He shared with Business Insider screenshots of commenters encouraging people to \"review bomb\" the restaurant.\n\nEarlier this month, Eden Millecchia hung a \"No ICE\" poster in the window of her airy shop, called Flowers & Candy. The following week, she attended an online training conducted by a chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union about where federal agents are permitted to go within a business if they don't have a warrant.\n\nMillecchia said she feels she's in a more privileged position to speak up than some other shopkeepers.\n\n\"I'm the white lady who can yell,\" she said.\n\nYet, Millecchia said, motioning toward the poster, the sign is a \"hollow gesture\" — other than the show of support it sends.\n\nWhat is tangible, she said, is the drop in sales she's seen since word spread that immigration agents were focusing on Maine. For the long weekend that included Martin Luther King Day — which also included some unforgiving winter weather — her sales were down 91% year-over-year, Millecchia said.\n\n\"They killed my three-day weekend, and I think that it's going to keep people from coming here,\" she said, referring to the presence of federal officers.\n\nThat could mean fewer people will pick up the CBD products whose sales she relies on to help make rent. Another disruption: She plans to close on Friday to support the strike.\n\nAn ICE spokesperson told Business Insider that it doesn't comment on immigration enforcement operations. US Customs and Border Protection didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn the steps outside Arcana Maine, a shop that sits opposite a small park and sells jewelry and works by area artists, a circular table recently displayed free business-card-sized guides to rights enshrined in the Constitution. The cards were printed in English, Spanish, French, Arabic, Somali, and Kinyarwanda, which is spoken in parts of Africa.\n\nAn employee named Nico, who declined to give his last name, said that giving the cards a prominent spot was a way to help the community.\n\nHe estimated that foot traffic at the store had fallen by at least half from what's typical for January.\n\nAt a skate shop called Mocean, owner Jasper Tripp said he hung a \"No ICE\" sign because it aligned with his beliefs. Ordinarily, he said, he tries to separate his political views from the store he has run for nearly a decade.\n\n\"It just feels right,\" Tripp said of the decision to put up the poster. He worked with an artist to design an anti-ICE T-shirt. Proceeds from its sale will go to charities supporting immigrants' legal expenses, he said.\n\nFor some business owners, concerns go beyond the risk of alienating customers. One restaurant owner said she plans to shut down for at least a week — and pay workers — while she's out of town. Ordinarily, she said, her employees would run the restaurant, which has an entirely Spanish-speaking staff.\n\nShe asked that Business Insider not use her name or that of her restaurant to protect her employees, who she said are legal immigrants but who nevertheless feel threatened.\n\nShe taped a \"No ICE\" poster to the door to help employees and customers to feel safe, not to denounce immigration agents, she said.\n\nThe balance is tricky, the owner added. \"I have the responsibility to keep people safe. I also have an economic responsibility.\"",

    "fullText": "Related video: Governor Spencer Cox spoke gave a State of the State address.\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (ABC4) — On Tuesday, Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall delivered the State of the City address. She highlighted priorities of civic development, public safety, and affordable housing.\n\nAt the beginning of the address, the Red Spirit Singers of the Uintah Tribe offered a presentation. Then, the CEO of the 2034 Olympics spoke about the city’s preparations for the upcoming Games and stated that Mendenhall has been instrumental in bringing the Games back to Utah.\n\nHe added that the games will bring a possibility of unity throughout the state, and all residents will be able to be involved in the community to bring the Olympic spirit locally.\n\nHow to make ABC4 your preferred news source on Google\n\nDuring her speech, Mendenhall highlighted several of her priorities and the issues facing her constituents and the city. One thing she spoke on was the 2025 safety plan recommendation, and she says they have completed over half of the outlined solutions and are now working on implementing the long-term solutions.\n\nMendenhall also noted the city completed the voter streets bond, resurfaced and replaced hundreds of miles of roads, and finished phase one of Glendale Park.\n\n“The next chapter of our city’s story and our state’s and our nation’s is not waiting to be written. We’re writing it now, and in doing so, we will not stand still. We will not slow our commitments, and we will not govern for comfort when the moment calls for resolve,” Mendenhall said.\n\nShe emphasized that the state of the city will be determined by what comes next, not by what they have already done.\n\nMendenhall partially addressed issues of public safety and brought up an ongoing controversy surrounding a proposed immigration detention center in Salt Lake City. Members of the community protested the center, and Mendenhall stated that she sent a letter to the owners, stating that the city code prevents a large-scale housing center at the warehouse’s location in its current form. The warehouse’s owners stated in a press release on Saturday that they had no intent to sell or lease the property.\n\nOwners and investors of warehouse rumored to be used as ICE facility say they have ‘no plans to sell’ to the federal government\n\nMendenhall also spoke on national issues with immigration, including controversy after two people were shot and killed by ICE officers in Minneapolis.\n\n“I want to make it clear that I am prepared to use every tool under my control to protect the values of Salt Lake City and the dignity of every one of our residents,” Mendenhall said. “To this end, we have introduced the Future Citizens Path program to support eligible green card holders in Salt Lake City through the U.S. Citizenship process.”\n\nShe also addressed homelessness issues within the city and spoke on Project Connect, which targeted individuals with high arrest rates and connected them with social workers. 60% of those individuals reduced the frequency of arrests, and Mendenhall says they hope to expand this program in 2026.\n\nTen bills to keep an eye on during the 2026 General Legislative Session\n\nIn addition to reducing crime rates in homeless communities, Mendenhall stated that Salt Lake City will launch a program to invest in repairs to existing affordable housing and help renters become homeowners.\n\nAdditionally, Mendenhall mentioned that ongoing efforts would add more community centers throughout Salt Lake City, involving residents in each area. To this end, she shared planned designs for Salt Lake City’s civic center.\n\n“We owe it to those who came before us to protect those seeking a better life to ensure those who arrive are not persecuted for their beliefs like so many of Utah’s first pioneers, but that they are embraced,” Mayor Mendenhall said, concluding her speech. “That they are welcomed. That they may become a part of our strong community.”\n\nIncreased police presence at University of Utah after bomb threat reported\n\nFlorida man sentenced to prison on charges connected with South Jordan 15-year-old who disappeared for a month\n\nHouse committee hears bill created to address electric-assisted bicycle (e-bike) safety concerns\n\nHouse Republicans warn against Senate changing DHS funding bill\n\nThis is The Place Heritage Park is the spot for weddings, reunions, and big days",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Two federal officers fired shots during the encounter that killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti over the weekend in Minneapolis, a Customs and Border Protection official told Congress in a notice sent Tuesday, while Ecuador’s minister of foreign affairs filed an objection saying immigration agents tried to enter the country's consulate in the city without permission.\n\nOfficers tried to take Pretti into custody and he resisted, leading to a struggle, according to a notification to Congress obtained by The Associated Press. During the struggle, a Border Patrol agent yelled, “He’s got a gun!” multiple times, the official said.\n\nA Border Patrol officer and a CBP officer each fired Glock pistols, the notice said.\n\nInvestigators from CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility conducted the analysis based on a review of body-worn camera footage and agency documentation, the notice said. The law requires the agency to inform relevant congressional committees about deaths in CBP custody within 72 hours.\n\nSeparately, a man was arrested after he sprayed an unknown liquid at U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar while she was speaking at a town hall meeting in Minneapolis. The Democrat had just called for the abolishment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to resign when she was sprayed.\n\nTrump says 'we're going to de-escalate a little bit'\n\nThe developments came a day after President Donald Trump ordered border czar Tom Homan to take over his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota in the wake of Pretti's death, which was the second fatal shooting this month of a person at the hands of immigration law enforcement.\n\nThe president added of Homan, “Tom, as tough as he is, gets along” with governors and mayors, even in Democratic areas.\n\nAs he left the White House on Tuesday, the president was asked whether Pretti’s killing was justified. He responded by saying that a “big investigation” was underway. In the hours after Pretti’s death, some administration officials sought to blame the shooting on the 37-year-old intensive care nurse.\n\nStephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff who had initially called Pretti “an assassin,” issued a statement suggesting CBP officers in Minneapolis “may not have been following” protocol. He said the Homeland Security Department’s initial statements about what transpired on Saturday was “based on reports from CBP on the ground.”\n\nEcuador files a protest with the US Embassy\n\nA video of the Ecuadorian consulate entry attempt posted on social media shows a staffer running to the door to turn the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents away, telling them, “This is the Ecuadorian consulate. You’re not allowed to enter.” One ICE officer can be heard responding by threatening to “grab” the staffer if he touched the agent before agreeing to leave.\n\nInternational law generally prohibits law enforcement authorities from entering foreign consulates or embassies without permission, though sometimes permission may be assumed granted for life-threatening emergencies, like fires.\n\n“Consulate officials immediately prevented the ICE officer from entering the consular building, thus ensuring the protection of the Ecuadorians who were present at the time and activating the emergency protocols issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility,” the ministry wrote on X.\n\nA “note of protest” was filed with the U.S. Embassy in Ecuador so that similar attempts aren’t made at other consulates, the ministry said. The State Department, Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nTrump says of sending Bovino to Minneapolis: ‘Maybe it wasn’t good here’\n\nImmigration enforcement activity witnessed by journalists in Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs on Tuesday appeared comparable with recent weeks. As before, most didn’t result in major confrontations with agents. Activists say they continue to monitor enforcement operations through social media and chats on messaging apps.\n\nThe White House had tried to blame Democratic leaders for the protests of immigration raids. But after Pretti’s killing and videos suggesting he was not an active threat, the administration tapped Homan to take charge of the Minnesota operation from Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino.\n\nTrump said Bovino, the go-to architect for the president’s large-scale city-by-city immigration crackdowns, was “very good” but added “he’s a pretty out-there kind of a guy” and “maybe it wasn’t good here.”\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, along with the city's police chief, met with Homan on Tuesday and agreed to keep talking. Homan posted on social media that the discussions “were a productive starting point.”\n\nCourts weigh in on detained immigrants\n\nIn Texas, a federal judge issued a temporary order prohibiting the removal of a 5-year-old Ecuadorian boy and his father who were detained last week in Minnesota in an incident that further inflamed divisions on immigration. U.S. Judge Fred Biery ruled Monday that any removal or transfer of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, is on hold while a court case proceeds.\n\nAlso in Texas, federal immigration authorities released an Ecuadorian man whose detention led the chief federal judge in Minnesota to order the head of ICE to appear in his courtroom, the man's attorney said.\n\nAttorney Graham Ojala-Barbour said the man was released in Texas. The lawyer said in an email to The Associated Press that he was notified in an email from the U.S. attorneys office in Minneapolis that his client had been freed.\n\nIn an order dated Monday, Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz expressed frustration with the Trump administration’s handling of immigration cases. He took the extraordinary step of ordering Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, to personally appear in his courtroom Friday.\n\nSchiltz had said in his order that he would cancel Lyons’ appearance if the man was released from custody.\n\n“This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result,” he wrote.\n\nSchiltz's order followed a federal court hearing Monday on a request by the state and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul for a judge to halt the immigration enforcement surge. The judge in that case said she would prioritize the ruling but did not give a timeline for a decision.\n\nSchiltz wrote that he recognizes ordering the head of a federal agency to appear personally is extraordinary. “But the extent of ICE’s violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed,” he said.\n\nThe Associated Press left messages Tuesday with ICE and a DHS spokesperson seeking a response.\n\nCatalini reported from Trenton, New Jersey and Karnowski from Minneapolis. Associated Press writers Tim Sullivan in Minneapolis, Rebecca Boone in Boise, Idaho, and Michelle Price in Washington contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents attempted to enter the Ecuadorian consulate in Minneapolis on Tuesday, prompting the country’s minister of foreign affairs to file a protest with the U.S. Embassy in Ecuador.\n\nA video of the incident was posted online. It shows staff inside the consulate rushing to the door to prevent the agents from entering. “Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!” one man exclaimed. “This is the Ecuadorian consulate. You’re not allowed to enter.”\n\nEcuador’s foreign ministry issued a statement in Spanish about the incident. The following is an English translation of the statement:\n\nREGARDING THE ATTEMPTED INCURSION INTO THE ECUADORIAN CONSULATE IN MINNEAPOLIS BY ICE AGENTS\n\nThis morning, the Ecuadorian Consul in Minneapolis reported that, at approximately 11:00 a.m., an agent from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) attempted to enter the Consulate premises.\n\nConsulate officials immediately prevented the ICE officer from entering the consular office, thus guaranteeing the protection of the Ecuadorian citizens who were present at the consulate at that time and activating the emergency protocols issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility.\n\nTherefore, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic immediately submitted a letter of protest to the United States Embassy in Ecuador to ensure that acts of this nature are not repeated at any of Ecuador’s consular offices in the United States.\n\nGenerally speaking, officials from host countries need permission from consular staff to enter the premises. The Vienna Convention on Consular Relations – to which the U.S. is a party – states, “The authorities of the receiving State shall not enter that part of the consular premises which is used exclusively for the purpose of the work of the consular post except with the consent of the head of the consular post or of his designee or of the head of the diplomatic mission of the sending State.”\n\nICE and Border Patrol agents have swarmed the Twin Cities area in recent weeks as part of the Trump administration’s ongoing crackdown. On Saturday, Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis shot and killed Alex Pretti, who had been filming their activities in public. Earlier this month in the city, ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Good as she attempted to drive away from agents.\n\nThe post ICE Agents Try To Enter Ecuadorian Consulate in Minneapolis first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Mobile Fortify app being used to scan faces of citizens and immigrants – but its use has prompted a severe backlash\n\nImmigration enforcement agents across the US are increasingly relying on a new smartphone app with facial recognition technology.\n\nThe app is named Mobile Fortify. Simply pointing a phone’s camera at their intended target and scanning the person’s face allows Mobile Fortify to pull data on an individual from multiple federal and state databases, some of which federal courts have deemed too inaccurate for arrest warrants.\n\nThe US Department of Homeland Security has used Mobile Fortify to scan faces and fingerprints in the field more than 100,000 times, according to a lawsuit brought by Illinois and Chicago against the federal agency, earlier this month. That’s a drastic shift from immigration enforcement’s earlier use of facial recognition technology, which was otherwise limited largely to investigations and ports of entry and exit, legal experts say.\n\nThe app’s existence was first uncovered last summer by 404 Media, through leaked emails. 404 Media also reported, in October, about internal DHS documents that say people cannot refuse to be scanned by Mobile Fortify.\n\n“Here we have ICE using this technology in exactly the confluence of conditions that lead to the highest false match rates,” says Nathan Freed Wessler, deputy director of the ACLU’s speech, privacy and technology project. “A false result from this technology can turn somebody’s life totally upside down.” The larger implications for democracy are chilling, too, he notes: “ICE is effectively trying to create a biometric checkpoint society.”\n\nUse of the app has inspired backlash on the streets, in courts, and on Capitol Hill.\n\nProtesters are using a variety of tactics to fight back. They include recording masked agents, using burner phones and donated dashboard cameras, according to the Washington Post.\n\nUnderpinning resistance to ICE’s use of facial recognition are doubts about the technology’s efficacy. Research has uncovered higher error rates in identifying women and people of color than for scans of white faces. ICE’s use of the technology is often occurring in intense and fast-moving situations, which makes misidentification more likely. Those being scanned may be people of color. They could be turning away from officers because they don’t want to be identified. The lighting could be poor.\n\nThe Illinois lawsuit against the DHS takes particular issue with the federal agency’s use of Mobile Fortify and argued that the app goes far beyond what Congress allows with regards to the collection of biometric data. The complaint cited several examples in which federal agents appeared to take photos or scans of US citizens across Illinois without their consent.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers in Congress introduced a bill on 15 January that would outright ban the homeland security department from using Mobile Fortify or similar apps, except for identification at points of entry. This follows a September letter, sent by senators to ICE, asking \n\nThe DHS said in a statement that Mobile Fortify does not violate constitutional rights or compromise privacy. “It operates with a deliberately high matching threshold and queries only limited CBP immigration datasets. The application does not access open-source material, scrape social media, or rely on publicly available data,” a spokesperson said.\n\nAccording to 404 Media, the app’s database consists of some 200m images. “Mobile Fortify has not been blocked, restricted, or curtailed by the courts or by legal guidance. It is lawfully used nationwide in accordance with all applicable legal authorities.”\n\nObservers, experts, and at least one congressman have said federal immigration agents frequently do not ask for consent to scan a person’s face – and may dismiss other documentation that contradicts this data. ICE has been documented using biometrics as a definitive determination of someone’s citizenship in the absence of identification.\n\nThis means that ICE is not required to conduct additional vetting of facial scans or checks to avoid a misidentification. 404 Media reported earlier this month that Mobile Fortify misidentified a detained woman during an immigration raid; the app came up with two different and incorrect names.\n\n“Facial recognition – to the extent it should be used at all – is really supposed to be a starting point,” says Jake Laperruque, deputy director of the security and surveillance project at the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT). “If you treat this as an endpoint – as a definitive ID – you’re going to have errors, and you’re going to end up arresting and jailing people that are not actually who the machine says it is.”\n\nLaperruque says that even police departments across the country have pushed back against an over-reliance on facial recognition, treating it as a lead, at most. At least 15 states are cautious about using it all, and have laws limiting police’s use of the technology. In 2019, San Francisco became the first major US city to ban facial recognition technology by police and all other local government agencies.\n\nThe DHS issued a directive in September 2023 requiring that the bureau test the technology for unintended bias and offer US citizens the choice to opt out of scans not conducted by law enforcement. That directive appeared to be rescinded in February last year.\n\nICE’s stops – whether they involve face-scanning or not – have been subject to litigation as well. They have often been referred to as “Kavanaugh stops” after the supreme court justice wrote in a concurring opinion that Hispanic residents’ “apparent ethnicity” can be a “relevant factor” for ICE to stop them and demand for proof of citizenship. The ACLU sued the Trump administration earlier this month, accusing federal immigration authorities of racial profiling and unlawful arrests.",

Renee Good was killed in a confrontation with ICE agents on January 7.\n\nDalio — the founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the world's largest hedge funds — said that if President Donald Trump doesn't back down, it would \"risk pushing us over the brink into a more clear civil war.\"\n\nThe US leader could prevent further escalation by appealing for peace, showing the justice system will deal with the shootings fairly, and reining in his immigration enforcement, Dalio said.\n\nThe path Trump chooses \"will have huge implications for what comes next, including possibly lighting the tinderbox,\" he added.\n\nTrump has pivoted to a more conciliatory tone since the weekend. In a Monday post on Truth Social, the president said he had a \"very good call\" with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and the pair were on a \"similar wavelength\" on how to proceed with immigration enforcement in his state.\n\n\"Nobody in the White House, including President Trump, wants to see people getting hurt or killed in America's streets,\" Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said.\n\nDalio is one of scores of business leaders to speak out about the situation in Minneapolis. Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian urged US leaders in a X post to \"lead right now — deescalate,\" while philanthropist Melinda French Gates wrote on the platform that there's \"nothing more American than exercising our rights and holding our government accountable.\"\n\nDalio, the author of \"Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order,\" said the conflicts raging in the US today echo the decline of past superpowers. He said it was \"like watching a movie that I have seen many times in history.\"\n\nHe drew a parallel to a passage from his book: \"When broad-based discontent bubbles up and those in power allow it to grow, it can boil over to the point that when they try to put a lid on it, it explodes.\"\n\nDalio said on X that \"people dying in the fighting\" and \"conflicts between the states and the central government over their relative powers\" are two classic markers of the move into the \"more violent civil war stage,\" which often heralds the collapse of the \"monetary, domestic political, and international geopolitical orders.\"\n\nThe Wall Street titan and economic-history guru has been ringing the alarm on the crumbling of the current world order for several years now. In 2021, he pegged the probability of a US civil war within the next 10 years at 30%.\n\nHe has also decried the national debt of over $38 trillion, comparing it to an \"aggressive cancer\" and \"being on a boat headed to rocks.\"\n\nDalio wrote on X that the US needs to exercise greater \"financial discipline\" to protect its central role in the current monetary order, and resume abiding by the rules to allow disagreements to be resolved peacefully and democracy to function.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is headed to Iowa on Tuesday as part of the White House’s midterm-year pivot toward affordability, even as his administration remains mired in fallout over a second fatal shooting by federal immigration officers in in Minneapolis.\n\nIn a display of reducing tensions, Trump said he had “great calls” with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Jacob Frey on Monday, after federal immigration officers killed a protester for the second time in two weeks. Trump’s sudden shift toward a more conciliatory approach is just the latest in a string of moments where he's taken maximalist positions, only to appear to retreat.\n\nThe Trump White House has tried to blame Democratic leaders for the protests. But after videos suggest his administration wrongly labeled ICU nurse Alex Pretti an active threat to the ICE agents who shot him, the administration is trying to recalibrate its crackdown, putting White House border czar Tom Homan in charge of its Minnesota immigration operations among other moves and announcing that Greg Bovino was leaving the city.\n\nThe chief federal judge in Minnesota, meanwhile, ordered Todd Lyons, the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to appear before him Friday to explain why he shouldn’t be held in contempt for Trump administration failures to hold hearings for detained immigrants.\n\nTrump disputes staff and says slain Alex Pretti was not an ‘assassin’\n\nTrump was asked if the killed Minneapolis protester was an “assassin” as a key aide has claimed and the president answered “no.”\n\nThe president added, however, that protesters “can’t have guns” as Pretti did and “it’s just a very unfortunate incident.” Trump has said he wants the death investigated.\n\nOn Saturday, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller on social media described Pretti as an “assassin” who “tried to murder federal agents.” Vice President JD Vance shared the post on X as well.\n\nTrump says he’s going to be ‘watching over’ investigation into Pretti’s killing, which he calls ‘very sad’\n\nThe president was asked as he left the White House on Tuesday whether he thought Pretti’s killing was justified and he responded by saying that a “big investigation” was underway.\n\n“I want to see the investigation. I’m going to be watching over it, and I want a very honorable and honest investigation. I have to see it myself,” he said.\n\nHe was also asked about Pretti’s family and said in response, he said: “I love everybody. I love all of our people. I love his family. And it’s a very sad situation.”\n\nTrump says Noem isn’t going to resign\n\nAsked by reporters as he left the White House on Tuesday for a trip to Iowa whether Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is going to step down, Trump had a one-word answer: “No.”\n\nDemocrats in Congress have called for Noem’s exit after federal agents fatally shot two people in Minneapolis protesting immigration enforcement actions.\n\nTrump sent his border czar Tom Homan to Minneapolis and said on Tuesday that Homan was meeting with both the mayor and Minnesota governor.\n\nMinnesota resident says ‘world-changing events’ so close to home have been ‘overwhelming’\n\nChristina Leeson, who lives in the Minneapolis suburb Edina and was at Pretti’s vigil Tuesday morning, said Bovino’s leave is encouraging, though she’s hesitant to believe things are over since Tom Homan is coming in.\n\n“It’s just overwhelming, the amount of world-changing events that have happened within a 3-mile radius,” she said, referring to the death of Renee Good earlier in January, and George Floyd in 2020.\n\n“I feel like this is usually the time of year where I think we all kind of question why we live in Minnesota when it’s, you now, negative zero or below zero for weeks on end,” she said.\n\nLeeson said the way the community has come together in recent weeks has been a reminder of “the community, and how much we care for our neighbors and look out for each other, and are going to come out, and stand for what we believe is right no matter what.”\n\nWalz has made his priorities clear to Homan, governor’s office says\n\n“Governor Walz met with Tom Homan this morning and reiterated Minnesota’s priorities: impartial investigations into the Minneapolis shootings involving federal agents, a swift, significant reduction in the number of federal forces in Minnesota, and an end to the campaign of retribution against Minnesota,” the governor’s office announced.\n\n“The Governor and Homan agreed on the need for an ongoing dialogue and will continue working toward those goals, which the President also agreed to yesterday. The Governor tasked the Minnesota Department of Public Safety as the primary liaison to Homan to ensure these goals are met,” the statement said.\n\nImmigration agents still active across the Twin Cities\n\nIf they’ve changed tactics with the shift in tone from the White House, it wasn’t immediately clear in the Minneapolis and St. Paul area.\n\nThe streets appeared largely quiet Tuesday morning in South Minneapolis neighborhoods where unmarked convoys of immigration agents have been regular sights in recent weeks, including the neighborhoods where two people were killed by federal agents.\n\nBut Associated Press staff saw carloads of agents in northeast Minneapolis and in the suburb of Little Canada.\n\nEvery living former Democratic president has now addressed Pretti’s killing\n\nFormer President Joe Biden said on social media on Tuesday that the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis “betrays our most basic values as Americans.”\n\nFormer President Barack Obama said Sunday that the killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti by a U.S. Border Patrol officer should be a “wake-up call to every American” and warned that “our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault.”\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton’s statement Sunday said that “over the course of a lifetime, we face only a few moments where the decisions we make and the actions we take will shape our history for years to come.”\n\n“This is one of them,” Clinton said. “If we give our freedoms away after 250 years, we might never get them back.”\n\nCivil rights leaders to meet with Minnesota attorney general\n\nNAACP president Derrick Johnson and League of United Latin American Citizens president Roman Palomares will hold community events in Minneapolis on Tuesday before meeting with Ellison.\n\nThe events include a visit to the site where Alex Pretti was shot and killed by federal immigration officers for a “moment of reflection,” according to a press release from LULAC, and a “Community Conversation” held at NAACP’s Minneapolis headquarters.\n\nTrump immigration crackdown contributes to drop in US population growth rate\n\nTrump’s crackdown on immigration contributed to a year-to-year drop in the nation’s growth rate as the U.S. population reached nearly 342 million people in 2025, according to population estimates released Tuesday by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe 0.5% growth rate was a sharp drop from 2024’s immigration-fueled rate of almost 1%, which grew the population to an estimated 340 million.\n\nBirths outnumbered deaths last year by 519,000 people last year and 1.3 million people immigrated, compared with 2.8 million immigrants in 2024.\n\nIn the past 125 years, the lowest growth rate was during the coronavirus pandemic, when the population grew by just 0.16% in 2021. Before that, the lowest rate was just under 0.5% in 1919 during the Spanish flu.\n\n▶ Read more about how Trump policies are affecting U.S. population numbers\n\nMinnesota attorney general wants more than talk from Trump administration\n\nKeith Ellison said he hopes Trump’s “Operation Metro Surge” will end immediately. Asked on MS NOW’s “Morning Joe” Tuesday if Trump’s newly conciliatory posture has led to more federal cooperation with state and local officials in Minneapolis, Ellison said “not that I’ve seen so far.”\n\n“You should understand, Minnesota is abiding by the law as written. We, under the 10th Amendment, the federal government doesn’t have the authority to convert us into its deputies,” Ellison said. “And what the federal government has done is said, ‘well, if you don’t do it our way, we’re going to saturate your state with 4,000 ICE agents until you cry uncle and obey.’ And that’s unconstitutional and illegal.”\n\n“It’s a good thing” Trump talked with Minnesota’s governor and Minneapolis’ mayor, Ellison said. “But we need to see some results ... they’ve got to show, not just say.”\n\nBrandi Carlile donating to defense of Minnesota ICE detainees\n\nDescribing herself as “heartbroken and angry for Minnesota,” the singer-songwriter says her foundation will grant $25,000 to a Minnesota organization that provides legal defense to people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n“Over the past month, the community there has continued to set an incredible example for the rest of us, demonstrating the power of uniting to protect our neighbors and defend what is right,” she posted on Instagram Monday. “Now, more than ever, it is vital that we continue to hold each other and take action to stop the hate that is spreading through our country.”\n\nCarlile said the Looking Out Foundation is granting the money to help The Advocates for Human Rights provide free legal assistance to detainees.\n\nFetterman calls on Trump to fire Noem\n\nPennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman is calling on Trump to fire Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem after federal agents fatally shot two protesters in Minneapolis.\n\n“Americans have died,” Fetterman said in a direct appeal to Trump. “She is betraying DHS’s core mission and trashing your border security legacy.”\n\nFetterman, a Democrat who has increasingly voted with Republicans, said Trump should “NOT make the mistake President Biden made for not firing a grossly incompetent DHS Secretary.”\n\nFetterman voted with Democrats in April 2024 to dismiss a trial against Biden’s Homeland Security Secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, after he was impeached by the Republican-led House.\n\nWhat to know about Gregory Bovino\n\nThe field commander of Trump’s immigration crackdown in Minneapolis is leaving the city after federal agents fatally shot two people.\n\nBovino had been the go-to architect for the large-scale immigration crackdowns ordered by Trump and the public face of his administration’s city-by-city sweeps. The Border Patrol chief led agents in Los Angeles, Chicago and New Orleans before he headed to Minnesota in December for what the Department of Homeland Security called its largest-ever immigration enforcement operation.\n\n“We’re going to turn and burn to that next target and the next and the next and the next, and we’re not going to stop,” Bovino said in an interview.\n\n▶ Read more about Bovino’s career, methods and approach\n\nMelania Trump, on morning show, calls for unity\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump said in a Fox News interview Tuesday that Americans needed to come together as protests continue in Minneapolis.\n\n“I’m against the violence. So, if — please, if you protest, protest in peace. And we need to unify in these times,” she said.\n\nMelania Trump’s comments went beyond her husband’s in calling for calm, though he has softened his rhetoric in recent days while continuing to blame Democrats for the violence.\n\nShe also echoed the president’s previous statements that he had a “great call” Monday with Walz and Frey, adding they were working together to ensure protests were “without riots.”\n\nThe interview with Ainsley Earnhardt on “Fox & Friends” was pegged to the upcoming release of a new documentary about the first lady.\n\nThis item has been corrected. Melania Trump said “if you protest,” not “if we protest.”\n\nTrump says his calls with Minnesota Democratic leaders were ‘great’\n\nIn a display of reducing tensions, Trump said in a radio interview broadcast Tuesday that he had “great calls” with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Jacob Frey on Monday, after federal immigration officers killed a protester for the second time in two weeks.\n\nThe Trump White House has tried to blame Democratic leaders for the protests. But after videos suggest his administration wrongly labeled Alex Pretti an active threat to ICE agents, the administration is trying to recalibrate its crackdown, putting White House border czar Tom Homan in charge of its Minnesota immigration operations among other moves.\n\n“Actually, they were both great conversations,” the president said on the show “Sid & Friends In The Morning” on 77 WABC in New York City. “So let’s hope that turns out to be so.”\n\nICE chief must appear in court to explain why detainees have been denied due process\n\nThe chief federal judge in Minnesota says the Trump administration has failed to comply with orders to hold hearings for detained immigrants. He’s ordered Todd Lyons, Trump’s acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to appear before him Friday to explain why he shouldn’t be held in contempt.\n\n“This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result,” Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz wrote in the order dated Monday.\n\nMessages were sent Tuesday to ICE and a DHS spokesperson seeking a response.\n\nICE agents will have a security role at Milan Cortina Olympics\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents will have a security role during the upcoming Milan Cortina Winter Games, according to information shared with local media by sources at the U.S. Embassy in Rome. The Associated Press independently confirmed the information with two sources at the embassy.\n\nThe sources who confirmed ICE participation on Tuesday said that federal ICE agents would support diplomatic security details and would not run any immigration enforcement operations.\n\nDuring previous Olympics, several federal agencies have supported security for U.S. diplomats, including the investigative component of ICE called Homeland Security Investigations, the sources said. They could not be named because they are not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nMilan Mayor Giuseppe Sala said that ICE would not be welcome in his city, which is hosting most ice sports during the Feb. 6-22 Winter Games.\n\n▶ Read more about the ICE agents' planned role in Milan\n\n—- By Trisha Thomas and David Biller\n\nBovino is set to leave Minneapolis as Trump reshuffles the leadership of his immigration crackdown\n\nBorder Patrol commander Gregory Bovino is expected to leave Minneapolis on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the matter, as the Trump administration reshuffles leadership of its immigration enforcement operation and scales back the federal presence after a second fatal shooting by federal officers.\n\nTrump said he was placing his border czar, Tom Homan, in charge of the mission, with Homan reporting directly to the White House, after Bovino drew condemnation for claiming the man who was killed, Alex Pretti, had been planning to “massacre” law enforcement officers, a characterization that authorities had not substantiated.\n\nBovino’s leadership of highly visible federal crackdowns, including operations that sparked mass demonstrations in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and Minneapolis, has drawn fierce criticism from local officials, civil rights advocates and congressional Democrats.\n\nA person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press that Bovino is among the federal agents leaving Minneapolis. The person was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the operation and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.\n\n▶ Read more about Trump's ICE enforcement leadership reshuffle\n\nTrump administration’s trust and credibility tested in wake of Pretti’s death in Minneapolis\n\nTrust is one of a president’s most valuable currencies, especially in a time of crisis. During his second term, Trump has persistently undermined the trust and credibility of major universities, national law firms and media and taken punitive actions against them. His supporters largely either endorsed those actions or stayed mum.\n\nNow the credibility question is aimed at his administration. While the criticism is not directly aimed at the president by his supporters, it is a sign that trust is eroding over some of his most important policies.\n\nThe White House seemed to try to ease the conflict Monday. Trump and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz spoke and both suggested their conversation was productive. Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino, who has been at the center of the administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement surge nationwide, is expected to soon leave Minneapolis.\n\nStill, lawmakers from both parties — including many Republicans — called for independent investigations and, perhaps most importantly, trust after administration officials gave one account of the shooting in Minneapolis, while contemporaneous video provided a decidedly different one.\n\n▶ Read more about how Trump's credibility is increasingly being questioned\n\nTrump will visit Iowa in a bid to focus on affordability during fallout from Minneapolis shooting\n\nTrump is headed to Iowa on Tuesday as part of the White House’s midterm-year pivot toward affordability while his administration remains mired in the fallout in Minneapolis over a second fatal shooting by federal immigration officers this month. Even as some top administration officials moved quickly to malign Alex Pretti, the White House said Monday that Trump was waiting until an investigation into the shooting was complete.\n\nWhile in Iowa, the Republican president will make a stop at a local business and then deliver a speech on affordability, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. The remarks will be at the Horizon Events Center in Clive, a suburb of Des Moines.\n\nThe trip will also highlight energy policy, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said last week. It’s part of the White House’s strategy to have Trump travel out of Washington once a week ahead of the midterm elections to focus on affordability issues facing everyday Americans — an effort that keeps getting diverted by crisis.\n\nMinnesota killing produces backlash against Trump administration from Second Amendment advocates\n\nProminent Republicans and gun rights advocates helped elicit a White House turnabout this week after bristling over the administration’s characterization of Alex Prettibas responsible for his own death because he lawfully possessed a weapon.\n\nThe death produced no clear shifts in U.S. gun politics or policies, even Trump shuffles the lieutenants in charge of his militarized immigration crackdown. But important voices in Trump’s coalition have called for a thorough investigation of Pretti’s death while also criticizing inconsistencies in some Republicans’ Second Amendment stances.\n\nIf the dynamic persists, it could give Republicans problems as Trump heads into a midterm election year with voters already growing skeptical of his overall immigration approach. The concern is acute enough that Trump’s top spokeswoman sought Monday to reassert his brand as a staunch gun rights supporter.\n\n“The president supports the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding American citizens, absolutely,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.\n\nLeavitt qualified that “when you are bearing arms and confronted by law enforcement, you are raising … the risk of force being used against you.”\n\n▶ Read more about the backlash among gun rights advocates",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The fatal shooting of a Minneapolis protester by a federal immigration officer touched off a fierce national debate and prompted some fellow Republicans to question President Donald Trump's hard-line immigration crackdown, but the president on Sunday night continued to blame Democratic officials.\n\nAfter remaining relatively quiet on Sunday, the Republican president in two lengthy social media posts said that Democrats had encouraged people to obstruct law enforcement operations. He also called on officials in Minnesota to work with immigration officers and \"turn over\" people who were in the U.S. illegally.\n\n“Tragically, two American Citizens have lost their lives as a result of this Democrat ensued chaos,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social media network.\n\nTrump's refusal to back away from his pledge to carry out the largest deportation program in history and the surge of immigration officers to heavily Democratic cities came as more Republicans began calling for a deeper investigation and expressing unease with some of the administration's tactics.\n\nTrump also told The Wall Street Journal in an interview Sunday that his administration was “reviewing everything,” but he refused to say whether the officer who shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti acted appropriately.\n\n“We’re looking, we’re reviewing everything and will come out with a determination,” Trump said.\n\nThe White House did not answer questions about whether Trump watched the videos of the shooting in Minnesota, which seemed to contradict the account of what happened by members of his administration, or whether he planned to speak to Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who had appealed to the president to help bring calm to the city.\n\nInstead, Trump on Sunday night said he would call on Congress to pass legislation banning so-called sanctuary cities. His administration has sought to apply the label to communities based on their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts, among other factors.\n\nHis push for action by lawmakers comes even as outrage over the shooting has raised the possibility of a partial government shutdown in a week because of a standoff over additional funding for immigration enforcement.\n\nTrump's initial reaction to the shooting of Pretti came hours after it took place on Saturday. In a post on his Truth Social network, he questioned why Pretti had a firearm and accused Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey of inciting \"Insurrection, with their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric.”\n\nBut throughout the weekend, Trump, who rarely lets a major moment go without comment, did not make any public appearances or express any dismay over Pretti's death.\n\nInstead, he posted online complaining about Canada and efforts to stop him from building an expansive ballroom at the White House, calling a lawsuit to block its construction “devastating to the White House, our Country, and all concerned.”\n\nHe also posted messages praising U.K. troops after his comments about them earlier in the week were widely interpreted as a grave insult and praising guests appearing on Fox News Channel.\n\nWhen he finally weighed in again Sunday night as criticism grew, Trump was unbowed.\n\nHe called on Walz and Frey, also a Democrat, to turn over for deportation anyone in the country illegally who was held in state prisons or local jails, along with anyone who has a warrant out for their arrest or a criminal history.\n\nIn his comments to The Wall Street Journal, Trump criticized Pretti for carrying a gun.\n\n“I don’t like any shooting. I don’t like it,” Trump said. “But I don’t like it when somebody goes into a protest and he’s got a very powerful, fully loaded gun with two magazines loaded up with bullets also. That doesn’t play good either.”\n\nHe said that immigration enforcement officers will leave Minneapolis “at some point” but did not offer a time frame.\n\nMembers of his administration, meanwhile, were quick to say the shooting, the second killing of a U.S. citizen in Minneapolis by immigration officers in recent weeks, was a case of an armed man provoking violence.\n\nDeputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller said in a post on social media, without offering any evidence, that Pretti was “an assassin” who “tried to murder federal agents.”\n\nVice President JD Vance shared Miller's post. He issued other ones blaming local officials and describing what was happening in Minneapolis as “engineered chaos” that was “the direct consequence of far left agitators, working with local authorities.”",

He explained that although he was initially supportive of the Trump administration’s mission to remove violent criminals from communities in the state, the recent actions of ICE have displayed “retribution” on U.S. citizens instead.\n\nI cannot support the national Republicans’ stated retribution on the citizens of our state, nor can I count myself a member of a party that would do so. I support the originally stated goals of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Operation Metro Surge, in locating and deporting the worst of the worst from our state. And I’ve seen many examples of ICE arresting non-U.S. citizens in Minnesota convicted of serious crimes, including murder, rape, and child sexual assault. No reasonable person should want these people here, and I am glad that they are gone.\n\nBut Operation Metro Surge has expanded far beyond its stated focus on true public safety threats. United States citizens, particularly those of color, live in fear. United States citizens are carrying papers to prove their citizenship. That’s wrong. ICE has authorized its agents to raid homes using a civil warrant that need only be signed by a border patrol agent. That’s unconstitutional, and it’s wrong. Weaponizing criminal investigations against political opponents is unconstitutional, regardless of who is in power.\n\nI am ending my campaign for Minnesota Governor. I describe why in the below video. Please watch until the end. (It is 10 minutes, 52 seconds.)\n\nThank you,\nChris pic.twitter.com/2nfyAyTzNZ\n\n— Chris Madel (@CWMadel) January 26, 2026\n\nMadel also accused national Republicans of making it “nearly impossible for a Republican to win a statewide election in Minnesota,” calling the ICE operation in the state an “unmitigated disaster.” His decision came two days after ICE agents shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti .\n\nThe post Minnesota Republican Quits Governor’s Race in Stunning Video Trashing His Own Party Over ICE’s Recent Conduct first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump’s administration opposed efforts to expand the use of body cameras by immigration officers and sharply cut",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s administration opposed efforts to expand the use of body cameras by immigration officers and sharply cut oversight staffing as it surged officers into Minneapolis and other cities, leading to a series of violent clashes.\n\nFootage from bystanders of two fatal shootings of U.S. citizen protesters, including Saturday’s incident that ​left an ICU nurse dead, has underscored the power of video in checking official statements that have portrayed people who have been shot as provoking violent encounters with immigration officers.\n\nCameras worn by ‌officers long have been central to police reform efforts for this reason. The Trump administration, however, moved last year to slow-walk a pilot program to give ICE officers body cameras, urging Congress in June to cut the funding by 75% and bucking a nationwide trend ‌of cameras for law enforcement.\n\nOfficials last year also placed on paid leave nearly all staffers working for three internal watchdogs conducting oversight of immigration agencies, undermining their capacity to investigate abuses.\n\nDarius Reeves, who was the director of ICE’s Baltimore field office until August, said a body camera pilot program rollout had been slow in 2024 under President Biden, a Democrat, and “died on the vine” under Trump, a Republican.\n\nIn response to a request for comment, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said ICE officers “act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities.”\n\n“Anyone pointing the finger at law enforcement officers instead of the criminals is simply doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens,” she said.\n\nAt least three of ⁠the eight or more Border Patrol agents at the scene of Saturday's ‌shooting were wearing body cameras, a Reuters view of verified video showed. Reuters could not determine if the cameras were activated or if any agents involved in the physical encounter were wearing them.\n\nEFFORTS TO SLASH ICE BODY-CAM FUNDING\n\nWhen ICE or Border Patrol have engaged in acts of violence - including the fatal shootings of U.S. citizens Renee Good ‍and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis - top Trump officials have been quick to label the deceased as aggressors rather than call for thorough investigations.\n\nTrump has started ramping up immigration enforcement this year after Republicans in Congress passed a bill last year that provides $170 billion for the crackdown, a major funding surge expected to transform the way ICE and Border Patrol operate.\n\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s immigration agenda, called Pretti a “domestic terrorist” and “would-be assassin” in social ​media posts hours after he was fatally shot by a Border Patrol agent.\n\nThe shooting has galvanized some Democratic senators who say they will oppose a spending bill to fund the U.S. Department of Homeland Security ‌unless it reins in immigration enforcement.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection - Border Patrol’s parent agency - had 13,400 cameras for some 45,000 officers as of June, according to a congressional aide.\n\nICE launched a body-camera pilot program in 2024 and deployed cameras to officers in five cities: Baltimore, Buffalo, Detroit, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C.\n\nWhile the Trump administration kept the program, it called on Congress to freeze its expansion and slash funds to run it in its budget request for fiscal year 2026.\n\nThe proposal called for maintaining ICE’s 4,200 body-worn cameras but cutting the 22-person staff to three employees and running the program in a more “streamlined” approach.\n\nDHS says there are some 22,000 ICE officers but a federal workforce database suggests the figure is lower.\n\nA homeland security spending bill passed in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives last week rejected that proposal, instead providing $20 million for ICE and Border Patrol cameras.\n\nStill, the bill - ⁠which now faces a challenging route to passage in the U.S. Senate - did not require either agency to use the devices.\n\nScott ​Shuchart, a top ICE official under Biden, said officers do not bring the cameras with them when detailed to other locations ​outside their normal operating area, an issue that has been more relevant as officers have been surged to cities around the country.\n\nDHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nCOMPLAINTS UNANSWERED AS OVERSIGHT STAFF CUT\n\nThe Trump administration placed some 300 workers in three separate DHS oversight offices on paid leave in early 2025 as it redirected thousands of federal ‍agents from across government to assist its crackdown, a move ⁠that drew criticism from Democrats and civil rights groups.\n\nA lawsuit over the reductions argues the Trump administration effectively eliminated the offices, something only Congress would be authorized to do, and left no way to address abuses.\n\nIn May, a career federal employee, Ronald Sartini, was tasked with top roles at three of the oversight offices, including the one that handled allegations of abuse in immigration detention.\n\nAs of ⁠December, there were only a few employees per office. The Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman had three full-time employees and two detailees, compared to more than a hundred in March.\n\nIn 2023, OIDO received more than 11,000 complaints in person and received 282 ‌complaints via its web portal, court documents show. Between March and December of 2025, OIDO received 285 complaints in total, court documents show.",

    "fullText": "Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr said his team won a \"bizarre, sad\" game at the Minnesota Timberwolves in a \"sombre atmosphere\" after the fatal shooting of an intensive care nurse by immigration agents in Minneapolis.\n\nThe death of 37-year-old Alex Pretti on Saturday was the second time in less than a month an American citizen has been killed by federal agents in the city, and has sparked angry protests both locally and in other parts of the US.\n\nThe Timberwolves held a minute's silence for Pretti before Sunday's game, which was punctuated by anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) chants from fans.\n\nAn ICE operation in Minnesota ordered by President Donald Trump's administration has been going on for more than six weeks. ICE agents have the power to stop, detain and arrest people they suspect of being in the US illegally.\n\nRenee Good, another Minnesota resident, was shot and killed by an ICE agent on 7 January.\n\n\"Honestly, what I felt was that [the Timberwolves'] group was suffering,\" said Kerr after the Warriors' 111-85 win.\n\n\"It was one of the most bizarre, sad games I've ever been a part of. You could feel the sombre atmosphere.\n\n\"Their team, we could tell they were struggling with everything that's been going on. And what the city has been through. So it was a very sad night.\"\n\nWarriors forward Moses Moody, who scored 19 points with eight rebounds and two blocked shots, said you could \"feel the weight of the city\" during the match, which had been postponed for 24 hours after Pretti's death.\n\n\"I couldn't imagine too many different times where that large amount of people are together in the midst of a situation like this, so you definitely felt that,\" said Moody.\n\nStephen Curry led the scoring for the Warriors with 26 points to climb level with Paul Pierce at 19th on the all-time scoring list - finishing the game with 26,397.\n\nAnthony Edwards scored 32 points and recorded 11 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who lost a fifth-straight match.",

    "fullText": "PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) — Federal immigration agents are top of mind for most of the nation, with no one more affected than the Hispanic population.\n\nOregon is seeing an increase in immigration arrests, with Gov. Tina Kotek noting how people fear going to work or school and to get medical care.\n\nAt the annual Tacos, Tequila and Tamales festival last year at the Expo Center, more than 3,000 guests shopped at 50 different vendors.\n\nBut this year, only 30 vendors showed up. The ones who canceled told organizers they are afraid of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The guest turnout was also slim, with not as many Latino families present compared to last year.\n\nGina Arroyo, owner of Anahi’s Tamales & Tacos, told KOIN 6 News this is a problem now impacting her business all year round.\n\n“Last year we had so many vendors we couldn’t even walk the hallways,” Arroyo said.\n\nShe’s now lost three of her employees that she says are too afraid to leave their homes to come to work.\n\nWomen’s shelter in downtown Portland gets new mural\n\nThe proceeds for the event go to the non-profit organization Latino Leadership NW, which supports young Latino students.\n\n“A lot of people have mentioned when they have called [to] cancel, ‘We don’t want to put our families, we don’t want to put our students in a hurtful, hurtful situation,” said Latino Leadership NW Executive Director Diana Avalos-Leos. “Last year we had more Latino likely families participate, right. We saw the moms and dads and the grandmas and the little babies in strollers. And this year, we’re not seeing, we’re not seeing our families.”\n\nThe fewer customers showing up to festivals like this negatively impacts local businesses, Avalos-Leos said.\n\n“I don’t know nothing about presidents, I don’t know nothing about politics. But I just wish that we were in a safer life, that people don’t be afraid, that my workers can come, that everyone can come and help, you know, just these hateful things to stop,” Arroyo said.\n\nJewelry store owner, Diana Perez, shared the impact on her mental health.\n\n“I’m having nightmares,” she said. “I wake up with heavy breathing and panicking and, at times, I just lose that. I break down.”\n\nLive performers from various schools were also set up to perform at the event on Sunday. But organizers said they too canceled because of fear of deportation.\n\nOther vendors told KOIN 6 News they have friends and family members too scared to go to school and work, saying this fear is impacting the local economy and education. They also wish they saw more support from the community and local lawmakers.\n\nOrganizers said they’re not sure if they will be able to host the event next year, though vendors like Arroyo and others are still holding out hope that the festival can thrive again.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Chris Finch's voice cracked and faltered as the coach expressed on behalf of the Minnesota Timberwolves their heartbreak for the community's collective fear and pain from the ongoing immigration crackdown, following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by a federal officer.\n\nFinch presents a straightforward, no-nonsense approach in his public statements and rarely reveals much emotion, but he was clearly moved by the situation in Minneapolis before his team hosted Golden State on Sunday. The game between the Timberwolves and Warriors was postponed by 24 hours, after Pretti was killed on Saturday.\n\n“I’m more than a resident. This is my home. I love living here. I love being a part of this community. I’ve been embraced from day one. People have been amazing. It’s sad to watch what is happening,” said Finch, who was hired by the Timberwolves five years ago. “On the human level, certainly as somebody who takes great pride in being here, I know a lot of our players feel the same. They all love being here, and it’s just hard to watch what we’re going through.”\n\nThe Timberwolves held a moment of silence for Pretti prior to the national anthem, just as they did for Renee Good before their game on Jan. 8, the day after she was fatally shot by a federal officer. The Trump administration in December launched what the Department of Homeland Security declared the largest immigration enforcement operation in history and earlier this month announced a surge of more officers to push their force past 2,000.\n\nThe NBA announced Saturday that the rescheduling decision was made to “prioritize the safety and security of the Minneapolis community” after Pretti was killed during a confrontation in a commercial district less than 2 miles south of Target Center. Finch said on Sunday that the Timberwolves pushed for the postponement to respect the public grieving process.\n\n“Playing basketball just didn't feel like the right thing to do,” Finch said, thanking the NBA and the Warriors for their support.\n\nWarriors coach Steve Kerr, long one of the league's most outspoken coaches, was measured but clearly moved as he expressed his own sympathy.\n\n“This has always been a great stop on the NBA tour. I love the city of Minneapolis. People here are wonderful, and it’s very sad what’s happening. I feel for the city. There’s a pall that’s been cast over the city. You can feel it. A lot of people are suffering, and obviously a loss of life is the number one concern. Those families will never get their family members back,” Kerr said.\n\nTens of thousands of people swarmed downtown Minneapolis on Friday in protest of the tactics and presence of immigration officers, a crowd the Warriors could see from their hotel as it moved toward Target Center. A smaller protest march took place downtown before the game Sunday.\n\nThere were plenty of other voices being raised around the sports world on Sunday. Women's basketball star Breanna Stewart held a sign with \"abolish ICE\" printed on it during introductions at her Unrivaled league game. Minnesota Frost fans during a PWHL game chanted “Ice out now!” The NBA Players Association issued a statement in support of the protests in Minnesota and urged its members to speak up.\n\nThe perspectives in a polarized country vary wildly on what constitutes constitutionally protected protesting and what becomes violent political disruption, and Kerr seemed to sense that tension as he spoke before the game on Sunday.\n\n“People are so angry. There should be an appeal to our better angels to look after one another and to recognize what’s happening. We’re being divided by media for profit, by misinformation. There’s so much out there that is really difficult for all of us to sort of reconcile,” Kerr said. “And so in times like these you have to lean on values and who you are and who you want to be, either as an individual or a country.”\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

    "description": "A federal immigration agent shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti, a US citizen, in Minneapolis on Saturday. He was an ICU nurse at a VA hospital.",
    "fullText": "America's largest network of labor unions has condemned ICE after a federal agent on Saturday shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident.\n\nThe AFL-CIO, which represents nearly 15 million workers, called Pretti's death \"senseless.\"\n\n\"As tens of thousands of Minnesotans made clear peacefully and powerfully yesterday, the Trump administration's horrific operation — and their actions aimed at stoking violence and chaos — must end,\" the labor group said in a statement.\n\n\"America's unions join the call for ICE to immediately leave Minnesota before anyone else is hurt or killed. We demand local authorities conduct a full, transparent investigation that will lead to accountability for this tragic and violent act, and for Congress to use its power to hold ICE accountable.\"\n\nA federal agent fatally shot Pretti in Minneapolis, where he worked as an ICU nurse at a US Department of Veterans Affairs hospital. Minneapolis police confirmed on Saturday that Pretti is a US citizen. He had been filming the agents when the confrontation began.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Border Patrol and ICE, said Pretti was carrying a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and \"approached\" agents at the scene. The department said officers tried to disarm Pretti, but he resisted. In multiple videos of the incident, however, Pretti is never seen threatening agents and is disarmed and subdued before he is shot. Minneapolis police said Pretti had a permit to carry the weapon.\n\nThe DHS deployed ICE and other federal agents to Minnesota as part of an immigration enforcement sweep called Operation Metro Surge, which began in December. The department says it has deployed around 2,000 federal agents across the state to detain and deport illegal immigrants. Trump has made securing the border and deporting those in the US who lack proper paperwork a central part of his administration's agenda.\n\nLocal residents and business owners, however, have criticized the tactics federal agents are using to find and detain those people, resulting in protests across the state. Tensions further escalated after an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old American citizen, on January 7.\n\nThe CEOs of Minnesota's largest businesses, including Target, Cargill, Allianz, and UnitedHealth, called for \"immediate de-escalation\" in a joint statement on Sunday.\n\nOn Saturday, Minnesota AFL-CIO President Bernie Burnham shared a statement calling for a \"full and transparent investigation\" into the recent shootings.\n\n\"'Operation Metro Surge' is not and has never been about enforcing immigration law. This is about a President who is angry with the people of Minnesota for disagreeing with his policies and is weaponizing the federal government against us in retribution,\" Burnham said.\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing Pretti and other federal workers in the US, also criticized the Trump administration in a statement on Saturday. As an employee of the VA hospital, Pretti was a member of AFGE Local 3669.\n\n\"While details of the incident are still emerging, one fact is already clear: this tragedy did not happen in a vacuum. It is the direct result of an administration that has chosen reckless policy, inflammatory rhetoric, and manufactured crisis over responsible leadership and de-escalation,\" AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in the statement.\n\nKelley said the presence of federal agents has stoked fear and division in the community.\n\n\"I urge everyone to remain disciplined and measured in public, even as we are rightly angry. Still, we must do what we can to maintain peace and calm,\" Kelley said. \"But do not mistake restraint for acceptance. Accountability will come, and AFGE will not be silent about the policies and decisions that led us here.\"",

    "description": "The shooting comes two weeks after the killing of Renee Good by an immigration agent in the city, which sparked protests",
    "fullText": "A man was shot and killed by an immigration agent in Minneapolis on Saturday morning, the second fatal shooting in a little over two weeks by federal authorities in the city.\n\nThe incident follows the Jan. 7 killing of Minneapolis woman Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, by a federal agent, and comes a day after mass protests in the city over a surge of immigration officers and sweeping raids across the state.\n\nA video of the incident, which took place at around 9 am, appears to show a large group of federal agents struggling with a man before one of the agents pulls a gun and fires several shots. The agent continues to fire while the man lies motionless on the floor.\n\nMinneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara told the Minnesota Star Tribune that the man died soon after. The victim was a 51-year-old man, according to hospital records obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a statement that it was carrying out a \"targeted operation\" when an individual approached U.S. Border Patrol officers with a 9mm semi-automatic handgun. DHS claimed the officers attempted to disarm the suspect, \"but the armed suspect violently resisted.\"\n\n\"Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, an agent fired defensive shots. Medics on scene immediately delivered medical aid to the subject but was pronounced dead at the scene,\" the statement continued.\n\nA separate video showing the lead-up to the fatal shooting shows the man standing still, filming a group of federal officers with his phone, before an agent approaches and pushes him backwards. The video then cuts before the shooting takes place.\n\nThe shooting prompted a wave of anger from local politicians, many of whom have been calling for the Trump Administration to bring an end to its immigration surge following weeks of violent encounters with Minnesotans, including the use of pepper spray and the arrest of peaceful protesters.\n\nMinnesota Governor Tim Walz called the shooting \"sickening\" and called on President Trump to end his immigration crackdown in the state.\n\n“I just spoke with the White House after another horrific shooting by federal agents this morning. Minnesota has had it. This is sickening,” Walz said in a post on X.\n\n“The President must end this operation. Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now.”\n\nDemocratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said: To the Trump administration and the Republicans in Congress who have stood silent: Get ICE out of our state NOW.\n\nThe City of Minneapolis said in a statement on X that the shooting had taken place in the area of 26th Street W and Nicollet Ave.\n\n\"We are working to confirm additional details. We ask the public to remain calm and avoid the immediate area,\" it added.\n\nA few hundreds 300 protesters gathered at the scene of the shooting in south Minneapolis by noon, where they scuffled with federal agents who had blocked off the intersection. Protesters screamed \"I smell Nazis\" at the federal agents and shouted at them to \"go home.\"\n\nThe agents deployed tear gas and used pepper-spray as they fought running battles with protesters.\n\nThe shooting comes a day after thousands took to the streets across Minnesota on Friday, closing down businesses and calling out of work in a mass protest against the Trump Administration’s immigration crackdown in the state.\n\nThe “Ice Out of Minnesota: Day of Truth and Freedom” demonstration, organized by community leaders, members of the clergy, and labor unions, called for a “no work, no school, no shopping” economic blackout.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A vast network of labor unions, progressive organizations and clergy urged Minnesotans to stay away from work, school and stores Friday to protest immigration enforcement operations, even as subzero temperatures beset the state.\n\nMinneapolis and St. Paul have seen daily protests since Renee Good was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Jan. 7. Federal law enforcement officers have surged in the Twin Cities for weeks and have repeatedly squared off with community members and activists who track their movements.\n\nOrganizers said Friday morning that more than 700 businesses across the state have closed for the day in solidarity with the protest -- from a bookstore in tiny Grand Marais near the Canadian border to the landmark Guthrie Theater in downtown Minneapolis.\n\n“We’re achieving something historic,” said Kate Havelin of Indivisible Twin Cities, one of the more than 100 groups that is mobilizing. The demonstration coincides with a blast of cold air hitting the Upper Midwest and ahead of a severe winter storm that is expected to affect millions.\n\nOn Friday, Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino sought to shift the narrative from that of a 5-year-old boy detained by ICE officers in Minneapolis by attacking the news media for, in his view, insufficient coverage of children who have lost parents to violence by people in the country illegally. After briefly mentioning the 5-year-old during a news conference, he talked about a mother of five who was killed in August 2023.\n\nOn Thursday, a prominent civil rights attorney and at least two other people were arrested for their involvement in an anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a Sunday service at a church in St. Paul. They remained in federal custody Friday morning.\n\nOrganizers hope Friday’s mobilization will be the largest coordinated protest action to date, with a march in downtown Minneapolis planned for Friday afternoon. Earlier Friday, the temperature in Minneapolis was minus 21 with a wind chill of minus 40 (minus 29 Celsius with a wind chill of minus 40 Celsius).\n\nHavelin compared the presence of immigration officers in Minnesota to the winter weather warnings.\n\n“Minnesotans understand that when we’re in a snow emergency … we all have to respond and it makes us do things differently,” she said. “And what’s happening with ICE in our community, in our state, means that we can’t respond as business as usual.”\n\nSomali businesses especially have lost sales during the enforcement surge as workers and customers, fearing detention, stay at home.\n\nMany schools were planning to close Friday, but cited different reasons. The University of Minnesota and the St. Paul public school district said there would be no in-person classes because of the extreme cold. Minneapolis Public Schools were scheduled to be closed “for a teacher record keeping day.”\n\nClergy planned to join the march as well as hold prayer services and fasting, according to a delegation of representatives of faith traditions including Buddhist, Jewish, Lutheran and Muslim.\n\nBishop Dwayne Royster, leader of the progressive organization Faith in Action, arrived in Minnesota on Wednesday from Washington, D.C.\n\n“We want ICE out of Minnesota,” he said. “We want them out of all the cities around the country where they’re exercising extreme overreach.”\n\nRoyster said at least 50 of his network’s faith-based organizers were joining the protest. About 10 were traveling from Los Angeles while others from the same group planned a solidarity rally in California, said one of the organizers there.\n\n“It was a very harrowing experience,” said the Rev. Jennifer Gutierrez of the large immigration enforcement operation in Los Angeles last year. “We believe God is on the side of migrants.”",

During his introductory press conference, Lee called himself “Grandson of the Wind.” His father is known as “Son of the Wind.”\n\nLee made his debut in the majors in March 2024 after playing for the Kiwoom Heroes in Korea for seven years. Lee agreed to a six-year contract with the Giants worth $113 million in December 2023, ESPN reported, citing unnamed sources, at the time.\n\nThe Giants will begin spring training for the 2026 season in Scottsdale, Arizona, in early February.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A prominent civil rights attorney and at least two other people involved in an anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a service at a Minnesota church have been arrested, Trump administration officials said Thursday, even as a judge rebuffed related charges against journalist Don Lemon.\n\nVice President JD Vance, speaking in Minneapolis, urged state and local law enforcement to collaborate with federal officials and said protesters must stop getting in their way.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi posted online that Nekima Levy Armstrong had been arrested. On Sunday, protesters entered the Cities Church in St. Paul, where an U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official serves as a pastor. Bondi later posted that a second person had been arrested, and FBI Director Kash Patel announced a third.\n\nThe Justice Department quickly opened a civil rights investigation after the group interrupted services by chanting “ICE out” and “Justice for Renee Good,\" referring to the 37-year-old mother of three who was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis earlier this month.\n\n“Listen loud and clear: WE DO NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS ON PLACES OF WORSHIP,\" the attorney general wrote on X.\n\nCities Church belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention and lists one of its pastors as David Easterwood, who leads an ICE field office. Many Baptist churches have pastors who also work other jobs.\n\nChurch lawyers praise the arrests\n\nProminent leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention have argued that compassion for migrant families cannot justify violating a sacred space during worship.\n\nAttorneys representing the church hailed the arrests.\n\n“The U.S. Department of Justice acted decisively by arresting those who coordinated and carried out the terrible crime,” Doug Wardlow, director of litigation for True North Legal, said in a statement.\n\nThe St. Paul-based nonprofit law firm has taken on religious freedom cases, including filing an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court supporting a Christian counselor who challenged bans on LGBTQ+ “conversion therapy” for kids as a violation of her First Amendment rights.\n\nLevy Armstrong, an attorney and longtime activist, had called for the pastor affiliated with ICE to resign, saying his dual role poses a “fundamental moral conflict.”\n\n“You cannot lead a congregation while directing an agency whose actions have cost lives and inflicted fear in our communities,” she said Tuesday. “When officials protect armed agents, repeatedly refuse meaningful investigation into killings like Renee Good’s, and signal they may pursue peaceful protesters and journalists, that is not justice — it is intimidation.”\n\nVance wants local law enforcement to assist federal officers\n\nState and local elected officials have opposed the crackdown that has become a major focus of Department of Homeland Security sweeps.\n\nVance arrived in the state less than a month after Renee Good was killed. He has called Good’s death a “tragedy of her own making.”\n\nBefore his Minnesota visit, Vance warned the church protesters: “Those people are going to be sent to prison so long as we have the power to do so.\"\n\nLater in Minneapolis, he urged state and city law enforcement to help federal immigration officers.\n\n“We’re doing everything that we can to lower the temperature,” Vance said, adding that he wants “state and local officials to meet us halfway.”\n\nGreg Bovino, a U.S. Border Patrol official, said Minneapolis police failed to help federal agents Wednesday who were surrounded by protesters at a gas station. Minneapolis police responded later that they hadn't received any requests from federal agents for assistance on Wednesday.\n\nLevy Armstrong has helped lead protests after the high-profile police-involved killings of Black Americans, including George Floyd, Philando Castile and Jamar Clark. She is a former president of the NAACP’s Minneapolis branch.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted a photo on X of Levy Armstrong with her arms behind her back next to a person wearing a badge. Noem said she faces a charge under a statute that bars threatening or intimidating someone exercising a right.\n\nPatel posted on X that Chauntyll Louisa Allen, the second person Bondi said was arrested, is charged under a law that prohibits physically obstructing or using the threat of force to intimidate or interfere with a person seeking to participate in a service at a house of worship. Patel said William Kelly has also been arrested.\n\nLevy Armstrong, Kelly and Allen have all been booked about 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of Minneapolis in Sherburne County Jail, where people in federal custody are usually held.\n\nA message seeking comment was sent to Allen's and Kelly's attorney.\n\nSaint Paul Public Schools, where Allen is a board of education member, said it is aware of her arrest but will not comment on pending legal matters.\n\nAllen and Levy Armstrong are part of a community of Black Minnesota activists.\n\nKelly has defended the protest and criticized the church for associating with a pastor who works for ICE.\n\nIn court Thursday, federal magistrate judge Doug Micko granted the women bond and restricted them from traveling outside Minnesota or from going near the church. The government said it would appeal and the women remained in federal custody Thursday afternoon.\n\nLevy Armstrong’s attorney, Jordan Kushner, said he offered for her to turn herself in peacefully, but the Trump administration insisted on arresting her.\n\n“They wanted a spectacle,” Levy Armstrong’s husband, Marques Armstrong, said, recalling around 50 agents came to detain her.\n\nArrests follow a DOJ civil rights investigation\n\nThe Justice Department investigated the church protest swiftly, but found no basis for a civil rights investigation into Good's death.\n\nAdministration officials have said the officer acted in self-defense and that the driver of the Honda was engaging in “an act of domestic terrorism” when she pulled toward him. Past administrations, however, have moved quickly to probe shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials.\n\nThe Justice Department has separately opened an investigation into whether Minnesota officials impeded or obstructed federal immigration enforcement though their public statements. Prosecutors this week sent subpoenas to the offices of Gov. Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her and officials in Ramsey and Hennepin counties, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nJudge rejects charges against Lemon\n\nA magistrate judge rejected federal prosecutors’ bid to charge journalist Don Lemon related to the church protest, said Kushner, Levy Armstrong’s attorney.\n\nLemon has said he was at the church as a journalist and not a protester.\n\n“Once the protest started in the church we did an act of journalism which was report on it and talk to the people involved, including the pastor, members of the church and members of the organization,” Lemon said in a video posted on social media. “That’s it. That’s called journalism.”\n\nLemon's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement that the judge’s action confirms Lemon’s work as a reporter was protected by the First Amendment.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear what the Justice Department would do after the judge’s decision. Authorities could return to a magistrate judge to again seek a criminal complaint or an indictment against Lemon before a grand jury.\n\nCNN, which fired Lemon in 2023, first reported the ruling.\n\nDurkin Richer reported from Washington.

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled on Thursday that the academics, who are party to a lawsuit alleging U.S. policy singles out noncitizens for detention or deportation over their pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses, can seek relief from the court if their immigration status is changed as retribution for taking part in the case.\n\nThe ruling from U.S. District Judge William Young comes in the wake of trial last year, in which he ruled the Trump administration violated the Constitution when it targeted non-U.S. citizens for deportation solely for supporting Palestinians and criticizing Israel. Young repeatedly chastised the administration for violating the First Amendment rights of the plaintiffs and, on Thursday, issued what he described as “remedial sanction to protect certain of the Plaintiffs’ noncitizen members from any retribution for the free exercise of their constitutional rights.”\n\nDuring the hearing in the case earlier this month, Young maintained that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their agents had engaged in an “unconstitutional conspiracy” to limit the free speech of the plaintiffs, creating a chilling effect on their rights by their attempts to “pick off certain people.”\n\n“The big problem in this case is that the cabinet secretaries, ostensibly and president of the United States, are not honoring the First Amendment,” said Young, an appointee of the late Republican President Ronald Reagan. “There doesn’t seem to be an understanding of what the First Amendment is by this government.”\n\nIn his ruling, Young said that a noncitizen challenging his or her immigration status change would have to prove that they were a member of the American Association of University Professors and Middle East Studies Association, the two groups that sued, between March 25, 2025, and Sept. 30, 2025. They would also have to show their immigration status had not expired and had not committed any crime after Sept. 30, 2025. The Associated Press is not aware of any members of these groups whose status has changed because they are part of the lawsuit.\n\n“Upon such proof, it shall be presumed that the alteration in immigration status is in retribution for the exercise during the course of the present case of their First Amendment rights,” Young wrote.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment\n\nDuring last year's trial, witnesses for the government acknowledged that the campaign targeted more than 5,000 pro-Palestinian protesters. Other witnesses for the plaintiffs testified to how the campaign stoked fear among academics and prompted some to stop their activism.\n\nAmong the cases that have fueled the lawsuit was that of former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil. Earlier this month, a federal appeals panel reversed a lower court decision that released Khalil from an immigration jail, bringing the government one step closer to detaining and ultimately deporting the Palestinian activist.\n\nThe three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals didn’t decide the key issue in Khalil’s case: whether the Trump administration’s effort to throw Khalil out of the U.S. over his campus activism and criticism of Israel was unconstitutional.\n\nBut in its 2-1 decision, the panel ruled a federal judge in New Jersey didn’t have jurisdiction to decide the matter at this time. Federal law requires the case to fully move through the immigration courts first, before Khalil can challenge the decision, they wrote.\n\nThe decision marked a major win for the Trump administration’s sweeping campaign to detain and deport noncitizens who joined protests against Israel. But it was not immediately clear whether the government would seek to detain Khalil, a legal permanent resident, again while his legal challenges continue.\n\nAnother was the Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was released in May from six weeks of detention after being arrested on a suburban Boston street. She said she was illegally detained following an op-ed piece she co-wrote last year criticizing her school’s response to Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nDuring the latest hearing in the case, Young repeatedly seemed baffled that the country's top leaders would attempt to implement such a policy.\n\n“How could this happen? How could our government’s highest officials seek to so infringe on the rights of people lawfully here in the United States,” he told the court. “The record in this case convinces me that these high officials, and I include the president of the United States, have a fearful view of freedom.”\n\nRamya Krishnan, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute, which argued for relief in court, said the “administration’s lawless efforts to deport pro-Palestinian advocates has spread terror in our campus communities.”\n\n“Students and scholars shouldn’t have to live in fear that ICE agents could seize them from their homes merely for engaging in political expression,” she said. “Today’s judgment makes emphatically clear that the administration’s campaign of intimidation must end.”",

    "fullText": "CHICAGO (AP) — A man accused of offering a $10,000 bounty over Snapchat for the life of a top Border Patrol leader was found not guilty on Thursday in the first criminal trial stemming from the Chicago-area immigration crackdown that started last year.\n\nJurors deliberated less than 4 hours before returning the favorable verdict for 37-year-old Juan Espinoza Martinez. He faced one count of murder-for-hire and up to 10 years in prison if convicted. Testimony lasted mere hours in the federal trial that was the latest test of the Trump administration’s credibility on federal surges that have played out from Minnesota to Maine.\n\nEspinoza Martinez, who wore a suit and tie, listened intently with his arms crossed near his stomach. He hugged his attorneys and shook their hands after court adjourned.\n\nAttorneys for the defense declined comment. Prosecutors did not address reporters waiting in the lobby of the federal court in downtown Chicago. Neither did jurors.\n\nAt the heart of the government’s case were Snapchat messages sent from Espinoza Martinez to his younger brother and a friend who turned out to be a government informant. One read in part “10k if u take him down,” along with a picture of Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol official who has led aggressive crackdowns nationwide, including in the Chicago area.\n\n“Those words do not indicate that this was a joke,” First Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Yonan told jurors during Thursday's closing arguments. “Those words have meaning. They are not innocent and harmless words.”\n\nBut defense attorneys said the government didn’t show any evidence against Espinoza Martinez who sent the messages as “neighborhood gossip” after coming home from work and unwinding with beers. He didn’t follow up on the exchanges and had only a few dollars in his bank account.\n\n“Sending a message about gossip that you heard in the neighborhood, it’s not murder for hire,” his defense attorney Dena Singer told jurors. “It’s not a federal crime.”\n\nHer office did not return a message seeking comment after the verdict. Neither did the U.S. attorney's office in Chicago or the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn court, prosecutors accused Espinoza Martinez of being “fixated and obsessed” with Bovino and cited other messages where he criticized the crackdown.\n\nEspinoza Martinez was arrested in October as the city of 2.7 million and surrounding suburbs were seeing a surge of federal immigration officers. Protests and standoffs with agents were common, particularly in the city’s heavily Mexican Little Village neighborhood where Espinoza Martinez lived.\n\nHe did not testify at his trial.\n\nBut attorneys played clips of his interview with law enforcement where he said he was confused about the charges and that he sent the messages without much thought while scrolling social media after work.\n\n“I didn’t threaten anyone,” he told investigators, interchanging English and Spanish at times in the interview. “I’m not saying that I was telling them to do it.”\n\nBorn in Mexico, he’s lived in Chicago for years but doesn’t have citizenship.\n\nDHS touted Espinoza Martinez’s arrest on social media with unredacted photos of his face, referring to him as a “depraved” gang member. Bovino has held the case up as an example of the increasing dangers faced by federal agents. Prosecutors included Yonan, the second-highest ranking federal prosecutor in the Chicago region.\n\nBut several federal lawsuits in Chicago have fueled skepticism about DHS’s narratives. Of the roughly 30 criminal cases stemming from Operation Midway Blitz, charges have been dismissed or dropped in about half. In a notable lawsuit that forced Bovino to sit for depositions, a federal judge found he lied under oath including about alleged gang threats.\n\nBovino did not testify at Espinoza Martinez’s trial.\n\nNationwide, dozens of criminal cases tied to immigration operations have also crumbled.\n\nFederal prosecutors initially referred to Espinoza Martinez as a “ranking member” of the Latin Kings, but their lack of evidence led U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow to bar testimony on the Chicago street gang at trial. According to the criminal complaint, Espinoza Martinez allegedly sent messages on behalf of the gang to other gang members.\n\nAt trial, there were minor mentions of the gang, including Espinoza Martinez saying in his interview that he had nothing to do with the Latin Kings. His brother, Oscar, testified that he took the Snapchat messages as a joke and were something he’d already seen on Facebook.\n\nSinger poked holes in the government’s case, including in the testimony of their first witness Adrian Jimenez.\n\nThe 44-year-old owns a construction company and had been in touch with Espinoza Martinez over Snapchat about work. Unknown to Espinoza Martinez, he had also worked as a paid government informant over the years after serving a prison sentence for a felony. He shared the Snapchats with a federal investigator.\n\nJimenez, who suffers from back problems, walked slowly with a limp to the witness chair and needed help getting up.\n\n“Would you solicit for hire an individual that was in that much pain and could barely walk?” Singer said to jurors. “That doesn’t make any sense.”",

    "description": "A Cuban migrant held in solitary confinement at an immigration detention facility in Texas died after guards held him down and he stopped breathing, according to an autopsy report released Wednesday that ruled the death a homicide.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A Cuban migrant held in solitary confinement at an immigration detention facility in Texas died after guards held him down and he stopped breathing, according to an autopsy report released Wednesday that ruled the death a homicide.\n\nGeraldo Lunas Campos died Jan. 3 following an altercation with guards. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said the 55-year-old father of four was attempting suicide and the staff tried to save him.\n\nBut a witness told The Associated Press last week that Lunas Campos was handcuffed as at least five guards held him down and one put an arm around his neck and squeezed until he was unconscious.\n\nHis death was one of at least three reported in little more than a month at Camp East Montana, a sprawling tent facility in the desert on the grounds of Fort Bliss, an Army base.\n\nThe autopsy report by the El Paso County Medical Examiner’s Office found Lunas Campos' body showed signs of a struggle, including abrasions on his chest and knees. He also had hemorrhages on his neck. The deputy medical examiner, Dr. Adam Gonzalez. determined the cause of death was asphyxia due to neck and torso compression.\n\nThe report said witnesses saw Lunas Campos “become unresponsive while being physically restrained by law enforcement.” It did not elaborate on what happened during the struggle but cited evidence of injuries to his neck, head and torso associated with physical restraint. The report also noted the presence of petechial hemorrhages — tiny blood spots from burst capillaries that can be associated with intense strain or injury — in the eyelids and skin of the neck.\n\nDr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist who reviewed the autopsy report for AP, said the presence of petechiae in the eyes support the conclusion that asphyxia caused the death. Those injuries suggest pressure on the body and are often associated with such deaths, he said.\n\nHe said the contusions on Lunas Campos’ body may reflect physical restraint and the neck injuries were consistent with a hand or knee on the neck.\n\nThe autopsy also found the presence of prescription antidepressant and antihistamine medications, adding that Lunas Campos had a history of bipolar disorder and anxiety. It made no mention of him attempting suicide.\n\nGovernment provided changing accounts of what happened\n\nICE's initial account of the death, which included no mention of an altercation with guards, said Lunas Campos had become disruptive and staff moved him into a cellblock where detainees are held away from others.\n\n“While in segregation, staff observed him in distress and contacted on-site medical personnel for assistance,” the agency said in its Jan. 9 statement. “Medical staff responded, initiated lifesaving measures, and requested emergency medical services.”\n\nLunas Campos was pronounced dead after paramedics arrived.\n\nLast Thursday, after Lunas Campos' family was first informed the death was likely to be ruled a homicide, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin amended the government's account, saying he had attempted suicide and guards tried to help him.\n\n“Campos violently resisted the security staff and continued to attempt to take his life,” she said. “During the ensuing struggle, Campos stopped breathing and lost consciousness.”\n\nAfter the final autopsy report was released Wednesday, McLaughlin issued a statement emphasizing that Lunas Campos was “a criminal illegal alien and convicted child sex predator.”\n\nNew York court records show Lunas Campos was convicted in 2003 of sexual contact with a person under 11, a felony for which he was sentenced to one year in jail and placed on the state’s sex offender registry. Lunas Campos was also sentenced to five years in prison and three years of supervision in 2009 after being convicted of attempting to sell a controlled substance, according to the New York corrections records. He completed the sentence in January 2017.\n\n“ICE takes seriously the health and safety of all those detained in our custody,\" McLaughlin said Wednesday, adding that the agency was investigating the death. DHS has not responded to questions about whether any outside law enforcement agency was also investigating.\n\nDeaths put a spotlight on Camp East Montana\n\nThe AP reported in August that the $1.2 billion contract to build and operate Camp East Montana, expected to become the largest detention facility in the U.S., was awarded to a private contractor headquartered in a single-family home in Richmond, Virginia. The company, Acquisition Logistics LLC, had no prior experience running a corrections facility and has subcontracted with other companies to help operate the camp.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the guards present when Lunas Campos died were government employees or those of a private contractor.\n\nA final determination of homicide by the medical examiner would typically be critical in determining whether any guards are held criminally or civilly liable. The fact that Lunas Campos died on an Army base could limit state and local officials’ legal jurisdiction to investigate.\n\nLunas Campos was among the first detainees sent to Camp Montana East, arriving in September after ICE arrested him in Rochester, New York, where he lived for more than two decades. He was legally admitted to the U.S. in 1996, part of a wave of Cuban immigrants seeking to reach Florida by boat.\n\nICE said he was picked up in July as part of a planned immigration enforcement operation due to criminal convictions that made him eligible for removal.\n\nIn addition to Lunas Campos, ICE announced that on Dec. 3 an immigrant from Guatemala held in Camp East Montana died after being transferred to a El Paso hospital for care. While the cause of death was still pending, the agency said Francisco Gaspar-Andres, 48, was suspected to have died of liver and kidney failure.\n\nOn Sunday, ICE announced that Victor Manuel Diaz, a 36-year-old immigrant from Nicaragua, died at Camp East Montana on Jan. 14 of a “presumed suicide.” The agency said Diaz was detained by ICE earlier this month during the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.\n\nUnlike with the two prior deaths, Diaz's body wasn't sent to the county medical examiner in El Paso. McLaughlin said Wednesday that the autopsy for Diaz is being performed at the Army medical center at Fort Bliss. DHS again did not respond to questions about whether any agency other than ICE will investigate the death.\n\nRep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes El Paso, called on DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd M. Lyons to brief Congress about the recent deaths.\n\n“DHS must preserve all evidence — including halting their effort to deport the witnesses,” Escobar said Wednesday. “I reiterate my call for Camp East Montana to be shut down and for the contract with the corporation running it to be terminated.”",

The officers then told him to knock on the door to his home to see if other people were inside, “essentially using a 5-year-old as bait,\" she said.\n\nStenvik said the family has an active asylum case and has not been ordered to leave the country.\n\n“Why detain a 5-year-old?” she asked. \"You cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal.”\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that “ICE did NOT target a child.”\n\nShe said Immigration and Customs Enforcement was conducting an operation to arrest the child’s father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, who McLaughlin said is from Ecuador and in the U.S. illegally. He fled on foot, “abandoning his child,” she said.\n\n“For the child’s safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended Conejo Arias,” McLaughlin said, adding that parents are given the choice to be removed with their children or have them placed with a person of their choosing.\n\nStenvik said another adult who lives at the home was outside when the father and son were taken, but agents wouldn't leave Liam with that person. DHS didn't immediately respond to an email Thursday asking if Conejo Arias had asked to keep his son with him.\n\nLiam and his father were being held in a family holding cell in Texas, Marc Prokosch, the family’s lawyer, said during the news conference.\n\n“Every step of their immigration process has been doing what they’ve been asked to do,” Prokosch said of the family's asylum claim. “So this is just cruelty.”\n\nMinnesota has become a major focus of immigration sweeps by DHS-led agencies. Greg Bovino, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official who has been the face of the crackdowns in Minneapolis and other cities, said 3,000 “of some of the most dangerous offenders” have been arrested in Minnesota in the last six weeks.\n\nJulia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said advocates have no way of knowing whether the government’s arrest numbers and descriptions of the people in custody are accurate.\n\nLiam is the fourth student from Columbia Heights Public Schools who has been detained by ICE in recent weeks, said Stenvik. A 17-year-old student was taken Tuesday while heading to school, and a 10-year-old and a 17-year-old have also been taken, she said.\n\nThe district is made up of five schools and about 3,400 students from pre-K to 12th grade, according to its website. The majority of the students come from immigrant families, according to Stenvik.\n\nShe said they've noticed their attendance drop over the past two weeks, including one day where they had about one-third of their students out from school.\n\nElla Sullivan, Liam’s teacher, described him as “kind and loving.”\n\n“His classmates miss him,” she said. \"And all I want is for him to be safe and back here.”\n\nThis story was updated to correct Greg Bovino's title to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection offical, not Patrol.",

    "fullText": "Online conservative figures are throwing a fit over newly inaugurated Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger implementing her policies.\n\nThe online right has been lamenting Spanberger’s first week as governor, claiming she was just acting as a moderate while running for office and has now taken a far-left turn.\n\nIn her first few days as governor, Spanberger signed several executive orders, one of which ended state and local cooperation with federal immigration agents, a policy proposal that she said she would enact if elected.\n\nConservatives are expressing outrage over Spanberger’s first moves, equating her to a villain, a witch, and one of the “most dangerous people in our society.”\n\nSpanberger’s overall agenda as governor, outlined on her campaign website, also aligns with her three terms as a House Democrat.\n\nThe Virginia-based Lepanto Institute, a Catholic organization, compared Spanberger to the White Witch in the Chronicles of Narnia in a post on X.\n\n“White liberal women are the most dangerous people in our society,” MAGA activist Laura Loomer posted to her 1.8 million followers on X.\n\nHarmeet K. Dhillon, assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice, called Spanberger “a Bond villain.”\n\nRepublican Arizona Congressman Abe Hamadeh posted on X that “What’s happening in Virginia should be a lesson to all Congressional Republicans. If Democrats regain power, they will unleash the most radical and transformative legislative agenda in our nation’s history.”\n\n“We won’t even recognize our country, and we may never get it back,” Hamadeh, who is known for introducing a bill that would mandate states only provide English-language voting ballots, claimed.\n\nSpeaking on Special Report with Bret Baier on Fox News, Josh Holmes, co-host of the Ruthless podcast, said of Spanberger, “She’s there for a cup of coffee, and all of a sudden, we have a Communist manifesto in front of us. This is going fast and furious, but it is how Democrats govern, regardless of what they say.”\n\nConservative nepo-baby Meghan McCain came under fire for posting a photo of Spanberger during the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection attempt, during which she was wearing an emergency escape hood.\n\n“Virginia is f---ed,” the post, which she deleted, said.\n\n“Screw any and all of you who lied to low information voters and sold Abigail Spanberger as some kind of moderate,” McCain said in a follow-up post. “She’s been in office like 6 hours and is already trying to turn Virginia into Minneapolis.”\n\nOther MAGA figures went further with their criticism of Spanberger, firing off theories about the Democrat governor and calling for certain Virginia counties to secede.\n\nMichelle Maxwell, a self-described “Proud Virginia Constitutional Conservative,” claimed that the Democratic Party is “grooming” Spanberger to run for president and that she would be the “new Hillary.”\n\n“Being governor is just a stepping stone. So while everyone is distracted with Gavin [Newsom] she is the plan,” she posted to her more than 330,000 followers, adding “Spanberger is the country’s problem now&we better not take her lightly.”\n\nMaxwell also claimed that New Jersey Gov. Mikie Sherrill, who is seen as comparable to Spanberger in terms of policies and demeanor, was also being groomed by the Democratic Party.\n\n“The fact that its 3 counties outside of DC that decide for the entire state should be grounds for the rest of the state to secede. We have no representation,” a producer for the far-right TimCast posted, adding, “Many aren’t even born in America. They’re trying to enshrine foreign control with that degradation of voting integrity.”\n\nThat claim was quickly slapped down as another user pointed out that even if Northern Virginia counties, where a significant portion of Virginia’s population lives, had not voted in the 2025 election, Spanberger still would have won the race.\n\nSpanberger beat her opponent, former Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, by over 15 percentage points, or more than 520,000 votes, flipping the state from Republican to Democratic control in the commonwealth’s 2025 gubernatorial election.\n\nDespite their current outrage over Spanberger, Virginia Republicans heavily doubted Earle Sears’ candidacy, as she frequently unraveled during interviews, and Trump snubbed her in the high-profile race, withholding his endorsement.",

    "fullText": "A tense scene unfolded in Willowbrook after a federal agent opened fire during an immigration operation on Wednesday morning, prompting a large response from local and federal authorities.\n\nA federal agent opened fire while conducting an operation in the parking lot of an apartment building near the intersection of 126th Street and Mona Boulevard. No one was hit, but it triggered a large response from authorities as crowds of people gathered amid the chaos.\n\nShortly after 7 a.m., U.S. Border Patrol informed the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department that the agency was conducting an operation in the area, according to LASD. The shooting occurred shortly afterward.\n\nIn a statement provided to ABC7, the Department of Homeland Security said the targeted operation began in nearby Compton, \"to arrest a violent criminal illegal alien from El Salvador, William Eduardo Moran Carballo, who is involved in a human smuggling operation and has two prior arrests for inflicting corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant.\"\n\nAn immigration judge issued Carballo a final order of removal in 2019, according to DHS.\n\nDHS says Carballo tried to evade arrest around 7 a.m. on Wednesday and rammed his vehicle into law enforcement. That's when one of the agents fired at Carballo, missing him, and he was taken into custody.\n\n\"In a dangerous attempt to evade arrest, this criminal illegal alien weaponized his vehicle and rammed law enforcement,\" the Homeland Security statement read. \"Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired defensive shots. The criminal illegal alien was not hit and attempted to flee on foot. He was successfully apprehended by law enforcement. The illegal alien was not injured, but a CBP officer was injured.\"\n\nFurther details on the officer's injury were not provided.\n\nVideo provided to Eyewitness News by a neighbor shows the man leaving the apartment building, getting into his car and driving away. Seconds later, neighbors say Border Patrol tried to take him into custody, and that's when the shooting occurred.\n\nAlong with several federal agents in tactical gear, sheriff's deputies and California Highway Patrol officers responded to the scene.\n\n\"This situation is evolving, and more information is forthcoming,\" DHS said.\n\nMeanwhile, the FBI told ABC7 that the agency was not a part of the operation and said that an evidence response team was being sent to the scene.\n\nA large group of residents and activists gathered near the scene late Wednesday morning as more agents arrived, denouncing their presence.\n\nIncredibly tense situation in #compton right now. Residents and activists are confronting agents performing immigration enforcement @ABC7 pic.twitter.com/s1C0JXGwWz\n\n— Josh Haskell (@abc7JoshHaskell) January 21, 2026\n\nSome were seen holding Mexican flags and filming videos on their phone. At one point, the group was yelling at members of the sheriff's department.\n\n\"I saw the car crash... it was just crazy,\" said one resident who lives in the area. \"It's just crazy how they're coming over here and interrupting everybody's livelihood and their lives... this is just their lives.\"\n\nSome of the people who showed up are TikTokers who said they're working to be a voice for those who may be afraid.\n\n\"The federal ones... they like to come and go,\" said Angie Vargas, a local TikToker and live streamer. \"They like to move quick, so the fact that they're here and this incident happened, I think honestly, they came to the wrong city. A lot of us are out against what's going on, but yes, they are around our city, and I think there's a lot of us out here... supporting the community, being an extra set of eyes for them. That's why we're here. We're filming. We're bringing everything... the truth of what's going on, because there's a lot of people that are scared to come out and see what's going on.\"\n\n\"People are not going to work. They're causing disruptions. It's heartbreaking. It hurts. Why are you all here?\" said neighbor Andre Smith. \"I heard this is border patrol. If this is border patrol, ya'll need to go and patrol the border.\"\n\n\"It brings a lot of chaos to the kids, to people that have no citizenship. They're just here to work. That's why we're here to support our people,\" said Eric, whose family lives nearby. \"They've been taking people with citizenships just because of the color of our skin. We're tired of it already. We need them out of here.\"\n\nThere were some tense moments between the federal agents and protesters, but it appears no less-than-lethal rounds were fired and no protesters were arrested.",

    "fullText": "ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Federal immigration agents bashed open a door and detained a U.S. citizen in his Minnesota home at gunpoint without a warrant, then led him out onto the streets in his underwear in subfreezing conditions, according to his family and videos reviewed by The Associated Press.\n\nChongLy “Scott” Thao told the AP that his daughter-in-law alerted him on Sunday afternoon that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were banging at the door of his residence in St. Paul. He told her not to open it. Masked agents then forced their way in and pointed guns at the family, yelling at them, Thao recalled.\n\n“I was shaking,\" he said. “They didn't show any warrant; they just broke down the door.\"\n\nAmid a massive surge of federal agents into the Twin Cities, immigration authorities are facing backlash from residents and the local leaders for warrantless arrests, aggressive clashes with protestors and the fatal shooting of mother of three Renee Good.\n\n“ICE is not doing what they say they’re doing,” St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, a Hmong American, said in a statement about Thao's arrest. “They’re not going after hardened criminals. They’re going after anyone and everyone in their path. It is unacceptable and un-American.”\n\nThao, who has been a U.S. citizen for decades, said that as he was being detained he asked his daughter-in-law to find his identification but the agents told him they didn’t want to see it.\n\nInstead, as his 4-year-old grandson watched and cried, Thao was led out in handcuffs wearing only sandals and underwear with just a blanket wrapped around his shoulders.\n\nVideos captured the scene, which included people blowing whistles and horns and neighbors screaming at the more than a dozen gun-toting agents to leave Thao's family alone.\n\nThao said agents drove him “to the middle of nowhere\" and made him get out of the car in the frigid weather so they could photograph him. He said he feared they would beat him. He was asked for his ID, which agents earlier prevented him from retrieving.\n\nAgents eventually realized that he was a U.S. citizen with no criminal record, Thao said, and an hour or two later, they brought him back to his house. There they made him show his ID and then left without apologizing for detaining him or breaking his door, Thao said.\n\nHomeland Security defends the operation\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security described the ICE operation at Thao's home as a “targeted operation\" seeking two convicted sex offenders.\n\n“The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,” DHS said. “The individual refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID’d. He matched the description of the targets.”\n\nThao's family said in a statement that it “categorically disputes” the DHS account and “strongly objects to DHS’s attempt to publicly justify this conduct with false and misleading claims.”\n\nThao told the AP that only he, his son and daughter-in-law and his grandson live at the rental home. Neither they nor the property's owner are listed in the Minnesota sex offender registry. The nearest sex offender listed as living in the zip code is more than two blocks away.\n\nDHS later released the names and photos of two people it described as “violent illegal alien sexual offenders” that it was seeking to detain in St. Paul. Thao said he had never seen these men before and they did not live with him.\n\nDHS did not respond to an earlier request from The Associated Press asking why the agency believed they were present in Thao's home.\n\nThao's son, Chris Thao, said ICE agents stopped him while he was driving to work before they went to detain his father. He said he was driving a car he borrowed from his cousin's boyfriend, whose first name matches that of one of the men DHS said it was seeking. Chris Thao said he did not know the boyfriend's last name.\n\nFamily fled Laos after helping US\n\nThe family said they are particularly upset by ChongLy Thao’s treatment at the hands of the U.S. government because his mother had to flee to the U.S. from Laos when communists took over in the 1970s since she had supported American covert operations in the country and her life was in danger.\n\nThao's adopted mother, Choua Thao, was a nurse who treated CIA-backed Hmong soldiers in the U.S. government's “Secret War” from 1961 to 1975 against the communists, according to the Hmong Nurses Association website.\n\nChoua Thao, who passed away in late December, \"treated countless civilians and American soldiers, working closely with U.S. personnel,\" her daughter-in-law Louansee Moua wrote on a GoFundMe page for the family.\n\nChongLy Thao says he's planning to file a civil rights lawsuit against DHS and no longer feels secure to sleep in his home.\n\n“I don't feel safe at all,” Thao said. “What did I do wrong? I didn't do anything.”\n\nBrook is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

    "description": "Loan Huynh, an immigration attorney in Minneapolis, shared her advice for employers and employees as ICE continues heavy enforcement in the area.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Loan Huynh, an attorney who serves as the chair of the immigration department at Frederickson & Byron, a law firm based in Minneapolis. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThere's a huge concentration of ICE enforcement right now in Minnesota, specifically here in the Twin Cities. My law firm works with both employers and their employees.\n\nEmployees are very scared — they may be specifically being targeted by ICE, or they have family members or loved ones who are being targeted by ICE and they want to protect them, or they're just scared to be out in public.\n\nThe ICE action isn't just against individuals who are foreign nationals in Minnesota; it's against anyone who appears to be a foreign national, or anyone who's questioned and believed to be not cooperating with ICE — and there could be potential consequences, as we've seen.\n\nIt's a really difficult time for employers now, too. They're facing situations where they may have employees who can no longer work for them or who don't want to come to work, so they have to look at providing them with work-from-home options or other arrangements.\n\nICE is coming to their parking lots or places of business; we're getting questions from employers about how to ensure ICE doesn't have access to their spaces.\n\nWe know that this administration is taking a much broader interpretation of what rights they have in order to enforce immigration laws, and employers must be prepared for this.\n\nAs any law-abiding citizen or entity, you want to cooperate with law enforcement, but it doesn't mean that you don't have rights.\n\nThese are private properties that the businesses own, and businesses can restrict access.\n\nUnless there is some type of judicial order, warrant, or subpoena, there is no obligation for an employer to undertake enforcement activities or to perform the work of ICE activities here.\n\nIf you're communicating that they cannot enter your place of business — such as with a sign that says it's private property and there is no access to ICE — they don't have the right to do that.\n\nWe recommend that employers establish a protocol ahead of time about what they're going to do if ICE comes to their place of employment or contacts them about a specific employee.\n\nWe know now that it can happen; we're seeing it in Minnesota in ways we've never seen before.\n\nHere are questions that I think all employers in the US need to really need to address before that happens:\n\nEmployers should prepare early, before ICE comes to your neighborhood, to your place of employment, or to your city.\n\nIf ICE produces a judicial warrant asking for information or a subpoena about a certain individual, the employer should seek counsel to see what they must do in order to comply with it, whether it's right away or to inform ICE that they need additional time.\n\nIf ICE comes and says, \"I want to talk to this individual,\" and there's no warrant to allow that, an employer can respond, \"Thank you for the request. We will need to seek counsel in order to determine the next steps. We'll be happy to convey this information to the individual when we are able to.\"\n\nI was just on the phone with an employer about potential scenarios that they may face. I asked them, \"What do you plan to do if ICE comes to your parking lot and just parks there? How will you respond to that? Or if you get a call from one of your employees who says, 'I'm too scared to walk out of my car here. I see that there are ICE agents in the parking lot.'\"\n\nIt's so important for employers to prepare for any possible scenario, role-play, and determine, with their counsel, how they will respond to a request from a government agent or ICE.\n\nWe're seeing situations where an individual will say, \"I don't want to speak with you,\" or, \"I have counsel. Please contact my counsel,\" and the ICE agents continue to pressure them. They get very scared, and that's understandable, but please remember that you do have the constitutional right to be silent and not to speak to any investigator without counsel.\n\nWe have Know Your Rights information on our website. Everyone should know they have the right to choose whether to speak to a government agent. They have constitutional rights that, just because they are being threatened by an individual, don't mean that they have to succumb to those threats or requests.\n\nAre you a business owner or employee who's had an experience with ICE?

    "fullText": "AI technology is about to create two crises for every country, says the author of the bestselling book \"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, while giving a talk on AI and humanity at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Yuval Noah Harari said that AI is going to plunge humanity into an identity crisis, since we have come to value ourselves based on our capacity to think, but AI will potentially outperform us on this task soon.\n\nSecondly, Harari said every nation is going to face an immigration crisis, comparing AIs to immigrants who will bring benefits into a country, such as skills in medicine and teaching, but disruptions alongside those benefits.\n\n\"Those who are concerned about human immigrants usually argue that immigrants might take jobs, might change the local culture, might be politically disloyal. I'm not sure that's true of all human immigrants, but it will definitely be true of the AI immigrants,\" he said.\n\nHarari asked the audience whether they want to allow AIs to be recognized as \"legal persons\" with rights in their countries, giving them the ability to start businesses, form and preach their own religions, or befriend their children on social media.\n\n\"If you want to influence where humanity is going, you need to make a decision now,\" he said.\n\nHarari is a distinguished research fellow at the University of Cambridge's Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, and a history professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Alongside \"Sapiens,\" his book tracing human history across the centuries, he also released \"Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow\" in 2015, where he discussed the existential threat AI poses to humanity.\n\nHarari is not the first person to refer to \"AI immigrants.\" Earlier this month, the Nvidia CEO, Jensen Huang, referred to robots using the term, and said \"AI immigrants\" will help humans with work we no longer want to do, such as manufacturing jobs, AFP reported.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The Trump administration said on Saturday it was appealing a ruling by a federal ​judge that put limits on tactics employed by U.S. immigration ‌agents operating in Minneapolis.\n\nIn a brief filing, lawyers for the Department of Justice ‌told the court they were appealing an order issued by the judge on Friday that barred federal officers from arresting or tear-gassing peaceful demonstrators and observers.\n\nThe order was in response to a ⁠lawsuit filed against the ‌U.S. Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies on December 17, three weeks before an immigration ‍agent fatally shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old woman in Minneapolis. The shooting spawned waves of protests.\n\nThe Trump administration has sent thousands of immigration agents ​to the Minneapolis area in recent weeks as part ‌of a campaign to ramp up deportations of people in the country without authorization.\n\nTensions over the deployment have mounted considerably since an ICE agent fatally shot Good.\n\nThe court case was brought on behalf of six protesters and observers who claimed their constitutional rights ⁠had been infringed by the actions ​of ICE agents.\n\nThe order explicitly prohibits ​federal officers from detaining people who are peacefully protesting or merely observing the officers, unless there is reasonable ‍suspicion that they ⁠are interfering with law enforcement or have committed a crime.\n\nFederal agents also are banned from using pepper spray, tear ⁠gas or other crowd-control munitions against peaceful demonstrators or bystanders observing and recording ‌the immigration enforcement operations.",

    "description": "A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week's notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.  U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week's notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.\n\nU.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., concluded that the Department of Homeland Security didn't violate an earlier court order when it reimposed a seven-day notice requirement for congressional oversight visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.\n\nCobb stressed that she wasn't ruling on whether the new policy passes legal muster. Rather, she said, plaintiffs' attorneys representing several Democratic members of Congress used the wrong \"procedural vehicle\" to challenge it. The judge also concluded that the Jan. 8 policy is a new agency action that isn't subject to her prior order in the plaintiffs' favor.\n\nPlaintiffs' lawyers asked Cobb to intervene after three Democratic members of Congress from Minnesota were blocked from visiting an ICE facility near Minneapolis earlier this month — three days after an ICE officer shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis.\n\nLast month, Cobb temporarily blocked an administration oversight visit policy. She ruled Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week’s notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.\n\nA day after Good’s death, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem secretly signed a new memorandum reinstating another seven-day notice requirement. Plaintiffs’ lawyers from the Democracy Forward legal advocacy group said DHS didn't disclose the latest policy until after U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig initially were turned away from an ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building.\n\nOn Monday, Cobb ruled that the new policy is similar but different than the one announced in June 2025.\n\n“The Court emphasizes that it denies Plaintiffs’ motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge Defendants’ January 8, 2026 memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,” she wrote.\n\nDemocracy Forward spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said they were reviewing the judge's latest order.\n\n“We will continue to use every legal tool available to stop the administration’s efforts to hide from congressional oversight,” she said in a statement.\n\nTwelve other Democratic members of Congress sued in Washington to challenge ICE’s amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities. Their lawsuit accused Republican President Donald Trump’s administration of obstructing congressional oversight of the centers during its nationwide surge in immigration enforcement operations.\n\nA law bars DHS from using appropriated general funds to prevent members of Congress from entering DHS facilities for oversight purposes. Plaintiffs’ attorneys from the Democracy Forward Foundation said the administration hasn’t shown that none of those funds are being used to implement the latest notice policy.\n\n\"Appropriations are not a game. They are a law,\" plaintiffs’ attorney Christine Coogle said during a hearing Wednesday.\n\nJustice Department attorney Amber Richer said the Jan. 8 policy signed by Noem is distinct from the policies that Cobb suspended last month.\n\n“This is really a challenge to a new policy,” Richer said.\n\nPlaintiffs' attorneys said the matter is urgent because members of Congress are negotiating funding for DHS and ICE for the next fiscal year with DHS’s annual appropriations due to expire Jan. 30.\n\n“This is a critical moment for oversight, and members of Congress must be able to conduct oversight at ICE detention facilities, without notice, to obtain urgent and essential information for ongoing funding negotiations,” the lawyers wrote.\n\nGovernment attorneys have said it’s merely speculative for the legislators to be concerned that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week. But the judge rejected those arguments last month.\n\n“The changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,” wrote Cobb, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden.",

    "fullText": "EL PASO, Texas (AP) — An immigrant from Nicaragua was found dead at a Texas immigration detention facility last week, federal officials said.\n\nVictor Manuel Diaz appears to have killed himself Wednesday at the sprawling tent complex at the U.S. Army's Fort Bill base in El Paso, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement. The federal investigation into his death continues.\n\nIt's the same facility where ICE said another detainee died earlier this month as staff members tried to keep him from killing himself. But a fellow detainee said at least five officers were restraining the handcuffed inmate and at least one had an arm around his neck.\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE — This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988.\n\nDiaz was swept up on Jan. 6 in the federal crackdown on immigration in Minnesota and sent to Texas, ICE said.\n\nDiaz entered the United States in March 2024 and Border Patrol officers took him into custody, He was released on parole pending a court date and a judge ordered him to leave the U.S. in an August hearing that Diaz did not attend, ICE said.\n\nDiaz was given a final order for removal on Jan. 12, two days before he was found unconscious in his room, authorities said.\n\nICE did not release any other details on Diaz's death. The agency notifies Congress and releases a statement on its website of all in-custody deaths.\n\nDiaz, 36, was being held at Camp Montana East where ICE said another detainee, Geraldo Lunas Campos, died as staff members tried to prevent him from killing himself.\n\nBut a preliminary investigation by the El Paso County Medical Examiner’s Office found Lunas Campos, 55, died from asphyxia from chest and neck compression and said the death would likely be classified a homicide.\n\nA fellow detainee told the AP that Lunas Campos was handcuffed and refused to go back into his cell when at least five guards pinned him to the floor. The detainee said at least one of the guards squeezed an arm around Lunas Campos' neck.\n\nICE said it is still investigating that death.",

    "description": "U.S. Army Reserve Black Hawk pilot Chris Busby, 28, and Stephanie Kenny-Velasquez, 25, went to an Austin courthouse to get their marriage certificate on Dec. 3.",
    "fullText": "U.S. Army Reserve Black Hawk pilot Chris Busby, 28, and Stephanie Kenny-Velasquez, 25, went to an Austin courthouse to get their marriage certificate on Dec. 3.\n\nRoughly 48 hours later, Velasquez entered a Houston Immigration and Customs Enforcement office for a routine check-in and never emerged, Busby said. The uncertainty has left the newlywed questioning whether his time serving the country was worth it, he said.\n\n“Stephanie is beautiful, she is smart, she’s amazing,” he said. “If it means sacrificing myself or my career to free her, I will do it.”\n\nBusby, who enlisted in the Army Reserve in 2015, has spent the last six weeks looking for ways to free his wife from detention. Despite his years of service and their recent nuptials, Velasquez was denied bond on Jan. 9, according to her lawyer.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment. The Department of Justice declined to comment on Velasquez’s case.\n\nVelasquez came to the United States in 2021 hoping to start a new life far from the violence and political instability of her native Venezuela. She does not have a criminal record and presented herself to immigration officials in Miami when she arrived in the country.\n\nIn the meantime, Velasquez, 25, settled into life in Austin. She picked up a job at a local car wash and took classes to get her real estate license.\n\nThe couple met in March and Busby, 28, immediately knew she was the one.\n\n“I’ve never met anyone like her,” he said. “She came here and just wanted to be the best.”\n\nTheir families had no idea that the couple planned to marry, and that’s how Busby said he wanted it. Busby said he was saving up money from his glass installation business to pay for a big wedding down the line.\n\nVelasquez had an asylum case pending at the time of her detention.\n\nHer brother, Oscar, described his younger sister as ambitious and driven. She hoped to start her own company one day and diligently saved money from working at the car wash and helping Busby with his window tinting business. She was studying for her real estate exam on the car ride to her immigration check-in, her husband said, adding that the test was scheduled for the following week.\n\n“She worked so hard for everything she had,” her brother said. “She was so happy.”\n\nBut on the day his sister was scheduled to check in with immigration officials, the family remained worried that Velasquez could be swept up in President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown despite her recent marriage and pending asylum case, he said.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have fled political repression and economic crisis in recent years, arriving in the United States seeking asylum or other legal protections like temporary protected status, or TPS.\n\nTrump moved to revoke TPS for many Venezuelans, which has been in place since 2023, and from other countries as part of his agenda to restrict immigration. That has been allowed to move forward while legal challenges to the action make their way through the courts.\n\n“We left to have a better future, more opportunities. Now if we go outside, we could be stopped by ICE,” Oscar said.\n\nLike other Venezuelans who have emigrated, Oscar said returning to Venezuela right now is unthinkable following the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. The country is far too dangerous and unstable for them to return, he said.\n\nVelasquez was transferred to the Montgomery Processing Center in Conroe, nearly three hours away from Austin. Since she entered detention her hair has thinned, Busby said. She sleeps fitfully in a bunk bed surrounded by 80 women, who share seven tablets to contact loved ones and lawyers, Busby said. They are allowed one visit per week and given food that is barely edible, he added.\n\nThe stress has taken a toll on Velasquez, according to her husband.\n\n“The girl is 25 years old. She should not be looking like she’s pushing 40,” Busby said.\n\nThe couple is now hoping for a Hail Mary in the form of the military’s Parole in Place program, which is intended to provide legal protections for spouses who lack U.S citizenship.\n\nBut the administration has slowly chipped away at the program, and a 2024 court ruling ended a Biden-era expansion called Keeping Families Together, which added stepchildren to the list of eligible relatives.\n\nA message on the initiative’s website said the Department of Homeland Security would no longer accept applications or adjudicate ones that were pending. The agency did not immediately respond to a request clarifying whether the Parole in Place program still applies to spouses.\n\n“I’m trying my hardest but there is so little I can do,” Busby said. “I just want her out of there.”\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "description": "A hacker published several data samples online, including one containing the personal information of Israeli nationals living in France. The French Office for Immigration and Integration (OFII) confirmed the theft, but said the breach was linked to a subcontractor.",
    "fullText": "Personal data belonging to foreign nationals residing in France was posted online on Thursday, January 1, by a hacker claiming the attack was for profit. Writing in a specialist discussion forum, the individual said the information was obtained by hacking the French Office for Immigration and Integration (OFII).\n\nThe hacker released two samples. The first contains the details of fewer than 1,000 foreign nationals, from countries including Ukraine, Cameroon, Afghanistan, and China. The other concerns 600 Israelis currently or previously residing in France. Each file sample includes names, first names, date of entry into France, the reasons and type of stay (employment, family, refugee status, etc.), as well as email addresses and phone numbers.\n\nContacted by Le Monde, the OFII confirmed a data theft but explained that the information came from a subcontractor of the organization. \"This is an intrusion that is not directly linked to OFII's information system,\" Director General Didier Leschi said. The stolen information concerns immigrants who have participated in a so-called contrat d'intégration républicaine (CIR, \"republican integration contract\"), a government-mandated program for those seeking to stay long-term in France. The contract includes citizenship and language courses.\n\nAccording to Leschi, a third-party \"operator\" with access to OFII data as part of the CIR was used to extract personal information, although it is not yet clear whether this subcontractor was hacked or was 'complicit' in hacking. \"We will be filing a complaint and sanctioning the operator involved, as well as tightening security requirements,\" Leschi added.\n\nFor now, the data does not appear to have been sold, but uncertainty remains over the exact number of people affected by the breach. The hacker claims to have obtained a file with 2 million entries, meaning potentially 2 million people, but claims made on forums specializing in the sale of stolen data should always be treated with caution.\n\nYou have 24.85% of this article left to read.

    "description": "ICE officer in Minneapolis have turned to stopping U.S. citizens, apparently at random, demanding identification and grilling them about their citizenship, residents who have recorded these encounters on video say.",
    "fullText": "The officers and agents the Trump administration has unleashed in Minneapolis and nearby communities have turned to stopping U.S. citizens, apparently at random, demanding identification and grilling them about their citizenship, residents who have recorded these encounters on video say.\n\nThe “show me your papers” encounters are showing up on social media and have even prompted podcaster Joe Rogan, a Trump backer in the 2024 campaign, to ask, “Are we really going to be the Gestapo?”\n\nOne man, Gage Diego Garcia, said he was held for six hours on Monday in Columbia Heights, Minnesota, after an encounter with officers that he told NBC News began when he was leaning into his friend’s car in an alleyway.\n\n“They came off pretty aggressive and asking for my ID. I refused because I had done nothing wrong,” Garcia said. He said that, as he started to blow a whistle draped around his neck, agents “got angry and grabbed him.”\n\nVideo recorded by a friend shows officers pushing Garcia onto the side of a car and pointing a Taser at him. The video does not show what happened before the officers grabbed Garcia. Garcia told NBC News later that officers grabbed him when he was trying to blow his whistle and an officer accused him of committing assault by spitting at him.\n\n“All I needed was your f---ing ID,” a masked officer said. Garcia responds to the officer using expletives. The officer responds, “You’re a f---ing b--- and you are gonna learn the f---ing hard way.”\n\nAs officers search his pockets, one finds his firearm, saying, “He has a gun on him! Look at that.” Garcia interjects, saying, “a fully registered firearm ‘cause I’m a U.S. citizen.” Later in the arrest, as the two argue, an officer is heard saying, “You are a f---ing citizen, you shouldn’t have done that.” It’s unclear what the officer was referring to when he said that.\n\nGarcia said that as he was being driven to the Whipple Building in Minneapolis, officers told him in response to his question that he was picked up because he looked like someone who committed a crime. “When I asked what crime, I was told, ‘we’ll figure it out,’” he said.\n\nHe also said officers told him, “I could have f---ing smoked you,” and that things “could have gone really south for you like those agents did to Renee Good.” Good was fatally shot last week by an officer who fired through her windshield as she drove forward on a Minneapolis street. She was a U.S. citizen.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said the media is “peddling a false narrative” and “attempting to demonize” law enforcement, which it says are being attacked and assaulted at significantly higher rates.\n\nDHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement emailed to NBC News that Garcia fled on foot when he saw the officers, “giving them reasonable suspicion.” She said Garcia became “extremely hostile” and alleged he physically assaulted one officer by spitting on his face. McLaughlin did not specifically address Garcia’s allegations regarding what officers said to him as he was being driven to the Whipple Building.\n\nMcLaughlin said the Fourth Amendment allows law enforcement to use “reasonable suspicion” to make arrests,” and that the Supreme Court recently affirmed its authority to do so.\n\nMcLaughlin was referring to a September 2025 Supreme Court ruling that allowed immigration officers to continue immigration patrols using race, ethnicity and language as factors in stopping individuals. Opponents have said it allows for racial profiling. McLaughlin said DHS “enforces federal immigration law without fear, favor or prejudice.”\n\nThe Fourth Amendment also protects individuals from unlawful search and seizure.\n\nDavid Schultz, an attorney and legal studies professor at Hamline University in St. Paul, said U.S. citizens do not have to provide identification or prove their citizenship when out walking or standing in a street or in public.\n\n“We have a First Amendment right of association, to be out on the street and we don’t have any requirement to have an ID,” Schultz said.\n\nIn one encounter Sunday, a woman was stopped and grilled about her citizenship while walking in her neighborhood. Nimco Omar of Minneapolis said she was confused when, as she started walking after parking her car, she heard commands for her to stop. Suddenly several people she thought were soldiers began running toward her.\n\n“I was like, what’s going on? Did I do something? Is something happening? Is it war?” she told NBC News in an interview in Minneapolis.\n\nShe said when she heard someone ask for her citizenship she realized they were immigration officers. Fearing she’d be “kidnapped,” she pulled out her phone to record the encounter.\n\nThe video shows a masked officer threatening to put her in a vehicle to ID her if she doesn’t provide identification. Omar calmly responds that she doesn’t need an ID to walk around her city and that she is a U.S. citizen, declining to provide her identification.\n\nThe officer continues to insist on identification and says, “We are doing an immigration check. We are doing a citizen check.” He repeatedly asks where she was born and informs her that if she’s lying about being a citizen, she can face federal charges.\n\nOther such encounters were recorded in Minneapolis.\n\nLast weekend, officers walked up to a man pumping gas and asked if he was a U.S. citizen, demanding to see documentation. The man responds, “I don’t have to show you.” As with Omar, the officer in this encounter states that the man can show him ID there or he can take him aside. The man provides what appears to be a license, but the officer continues to ask whether he is naturalized, where he was born and when he was naturalized. In another incident, officers questioned a man at a vehicle charging station.\n\nDHS did not provide information on the citizenship status of the people approached in these encounters.\n\nIn her statement, McLaughlin did not provide details about the incidents with Omar, the man pumping gas or the man at the vehicle charging station.\n\nThese are not the first such encounters. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said in December that her son was pulled over and asked about his citizenship. The Department of Homeland Security has said it has no record of the encounter.\n\nThe administration has sent about 3,000 officers and agents to Minneapolis, a city of 430,000. Much of the enforcement activity has taken place in south Minneapolis, where a federal officer fatally shot Good.\n\nSchultz advised that U.S. citizens who are stopped should keep their composure, as Omar did. They should ask why they are being stopped and they should ask if they are under arrest. If the officers say no, they should then ask if they are free to leave.\n\nHe said he would never turn over ID and “we don’t have any requirement in our society to prove who we are to walk the streets,” he said.\n\nWhen driving a car and if pulled over for probable cause, showing a driver’s license is required. But he said you are not required to say whether you are a citizen, though some states, not including Minnesota, have laws that allow authorities to question immigration status.\n\nShaquille Brewster and Kailani Koenig reported from Minneapolis, Colin Sheeley from New York and Suzanne Gamboa from San Antonio.\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A Cuban immigrant died in a Texas immigration detention facility earlier this month during an altercation with guards, and the local medical examiner has indicated that his death will likely be classified as a homicide.\n\nThe federal government has provided a differing account surrounding the Jan. 3 death of Geraldo Lunas Campos, saying the detainee was attempting suicide and staff tried to save him.\n\nA witness told The Associated Press that Lunas Campos died after he was handcuffed, tackled by guards and placed in a chokehold until he lost consciousness. The immigrant’s family was told by the El Paso County Medical Examiner’s Office on Wednesday that a preliminary autopsy report said the death was a homicide resulting from asphyxia from chest and neck compression, according to a recording of the call reviewed by the AP.\n\nThe death and conflicting accounts have intensified scrutiny into the conditions of immigration jails at a time when the government has been rounding up immigrants in large numbers around the country and detaining them at facilities like the one in El Paso where Lunas Campos died.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is legally required to issue public notification of detainee deaths. Last week, it said Lunas Campos, a 55-year-old father of four and registered sex offender, had died at Camp East Montana, but made no mention of him being involved in an altercation with staff immediately before his death.\n\nIn response to questions from the AP, the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, on Thursday amended its account of Lunas Campos’ death, saying he tried to kill himself.\n\n“Campos violently resisted the security staff and continued to attempt to take his life,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said. “During the ensuing struggle, Campos stopped breathing and lost consciousness.”\n\nIn an interview before DHS updated its account, detainee Santos Jesús Flores, 47, from El Salvador, said he witnessed the incident through the window of his cell in the special housing unit, where detainees are held in isolation for disciplinary infractions.\n\n“He didn’t want to enter the cell where they were going to put him,” Flores told the AP on Thursday, speaking in Spanish from a phone in the facility. “The last thing he said was that he couldn’t breathe.”\n\nAmong the first sent to Camp Montana East\n\nCamp Montana East is a sprawling tent facility hastily constructed in the desert on the grounds of Fort Bliss, an Army base. The AP reported in August that the $1.2 billion facility, expected to become the largest detention facility in the United States, was being built and operated by a private contractor headquartered in a single-family home in Richmond, Virginia. The company, Acquisition Logistics LLC, had no prior experience running a corrections facility.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the guards present when Lunas Campos died were government employees or those of the private contractor. Emails seeking comment on Thursday from Acquisition Logistics executives received no response.\n\nLunas Campos was among the first detainees sent to Camp Montana East, arriving in September after ICE arrested him in Rochester, New York, where he lived for more than two decades. He was legally admitted to the U.S. in 1996, part of a wave of Cuban immigrants seeking to reach Florida by boat.\n\nICE said he was picked up in July as part of a planned immigration enforcement operation due to criminal convictions that made him eligible for removal.\n\nNew York court records show Lunas Campos was convicted in 2003 of sexual contact with an individual under 11, a felony for which he was sentenced to one year in jail and placed on the state’s sex offender registry.\n\nLunas Campos was also sentenced to five years in prison and three years of supervision in 2009 after being convicted of attempting to sell a controlled substance, according to the New York corrections records. He completed the sentence in January 2017.\n\nLunas Campos’ adult daughter said the child sexual abuse accusation was false, made as part of a contentious custody battle.\n\n“My father was not a child molester,” said Kary Lunas, 25. “He was a good dad. He was a human being.”\n\nOn the day he died, according to ICE, Lunas Campos became disruptive while in line for medication and refused to return to his assigned dorm. He was then taken to the segregation block.\n\n“While in segregation, staff observed him in distress and contacted on-site medical personnel for assistance,” the agency said in its Jan. 9 release. “Medical staff responded, initiated lifesaving measures, and requested emergency medical services.”\n\nLunas Campos was pronounced dead after paramedics arrived.\n\nFlores said that account omitted key details — Lunas Campos was already handcuffed when at least five guards pinned him to the floor, and at least one squeezed his arm around the detainee's neck.\n\nWithin about five minutes, Flores said, Lunas Campos was no longer moving.\n\n“After he stopped breathing, they removed the handcuffs,” Flores said.\n\nFlores is not represented by a lawyer and said he has already consented to deportation to his home country. Though he acknowledged he was taking a risk by speaking to the AP, Flores said he wanted to highlight that “in this place, guards abuse people a lot.”\n\nHe said multiple detainees in the unit witnessed the altercation, and security cameras there should have captured the events. Flores also said investigators had not interviewed him.\n\nDHS did not respond to questions about whether Lunas Campos was handcuffed when they say he attempted suicide, or exactly how he had tried to kill himself.\n\n“ICE takes seriously the health and safety of all those detained in our custody,” McLaughlin said. “This is still an active investigation, and more details are forthcoming.”\n\nDHS wouldn’t say whether other agencies were investigating. The El Paso medical examiner’s office confirmed Thursday that it conducted an autopsy, but declined further comment.\n\nA final determination of homicide by the medical examiner would typically be critical in determining whether any guards are held criminally or civilly liable. When such deaths are ruled accidental or something other than homicide, they are less likely to trigger criminal investigations, while civil wrongful death lawsuits become harder to prove.\n\nThe fact that Lunas Campos died on an Army base could also limit state and local officials’ legal jurisdiction to investigate. An El Paso County District Attorney’s Office spokesperson declined to comment Thursday on whether it was involved in an investigation.\n\nThe deaths of inmates and other detainees after officers hold them face down and put pressure on their backs and necks to restrain them have been a problem in law enforcement for decades. A 2024 AP investigation documented hundreds of deaths during police encounters in which people were restrained in a prone position. Many uttered “I can’t breathe” before suffocating, according to scores of body camera and bystander videos. Authorities often attempt to shift the blame for such deaths to preexisting medical conditions or drug use.\n\nDr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist who has studied prone restraint deaths, said the preliminary autopsy ruling of homicide indicates guards' actions caused Lunas Campos’ death, but does not mean they intended to kill. He said the medical examiner’s office could come under pressure to stop short of calling it a homicide, but will probably “stick to its guns.”\n\n“This probably passes the ‘but for’ test. ‘But for’ the actions of the officers, he would not have died. For us, that’s generally a homicide,” he said.\n\n‘I just want justice, and his body here’\n\nJeanette Pagan-Lopez, the mother of Lunas Campos’ two youngest children, said the day after he died the medical examiner’s office called to inform her that his body was at the county morgue. She immediately called ICE to find out what happened.\n\nPagan-Lopez, who lives in Rochester, said the assistant director of the El Paso ICE field office eventually called her back. She said the official told her the cause of death was still pending and that they were awaiting toxicology report results. He also told her the only way Lunas Campos’ body could be returned to Rochester free of charge was if she consented to his being cremated, she said.\n\nPagan-Lopez declined and is now seeking help from family and friends to raise the money needed to ship his body home and pay for a funeral.\n\nAfter failing to get details about the circumstances surrounding his death from ICE, Pagan-Lopez said she got a call from a detainee at Camp Montana East who then put her in touch with Flores, who first told her about the altercation with guards.\n\nSince then, she said she has repeatedly called ICE, but is no longer getting a response. Pagan-Lopez, who is a U.S. citizen, said she also twice called the FBI, where an agent took her information and then hung up.\n\nPagan-Lopez said she and Lunas Campos were together about 15 years before breaking up eight years ago. She described him as an attentive father who, until his detention, had worked in a minimum-wage job at a furniture store, the only employment she said he could find due to his criminal record.\n\nShe said that in the family's last phone call the week after Christmas, Lunas Campos talked to his kids about his expected deportation back to Cuba. He said he wanted them to visit the island, so that he could stay in their lives.\n\n“He wasn’t a bad guy,” Pagan-Lopez said. “I just want justice, and his body here. That’s all I want.”\n\nAttanasio reported from Seattle, and Foley from Iowa City.\n\nContact the AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org or https://www.ap.org/tips/.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge in Minnesota on Thursday ordered the release of a Liberian man four days after heavily armed immigration agents broke into his home using a battering ram and arrested him.\n\nU.S. District Judge Jeffrey Bryan said in his ruling that the agents violated Garrison Gibson’s Fourth Amendment rights against unlawful search and seizure.\n\n“To arrest him, Respondents forcibly entered Garrison G.’s home without his consent and without a judicial warrant,” he said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has been ramping up immigration arrests in Minnesota in what the department has called its largest enforcement operation. DHS says its officers have arrested more than 2,500 people since Nov. 29.\n\nMarc Prokosch, Gibson’s attorney, said he was “thrilled” by the judge's order. He had filed a habeas corpus petition, used by courts to determine if an imprisonment is legal, and called the arrest a “blatant constitutional violation\" since the agents did not have a proper warrant.\n\nGibson’s wife was inside their Minneapolis home with the couple’s 9-year-old child during the raid. Prokosch said she was deeply shaken by the arrest.\n\nGibson, 37, was being held at an immigration detention center in Albert Lea after being held at a large camp on the Fort Bliss Army base in El Paso, Texas, according to ICE’s detainee locator.\n\nDHS did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press requesting comment on the order and has not responded to a prior email with follow-up questions about Gibson’s case.\n\nGibson, who fled the Liberian civil war as a child, had been ordered removed from the U.S., apparently because of a 2008 drug conviction that was later dismissed by the courts. He had remained in the country legally under what’s known as an order of supervision, with the requirement that he meet regularly with immigration authorities.\n\nOnly days before his arrest, Gibson had checked in with immigration authorities at regional immigration offices — the same building where agents have been staging enforcement raids in recent weeks.\n\nBryan said in his Thursday order that he agrees with Gibson's assertions that since he had already been released on an order of supervision, officials “violated applicable regulations” by not giving him enough notice that it had been revoked and the reasoning, as well as not providing him an interview right after he was detained.\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Homeland Security Department, had said that Gibson has “a lengthy rap sheet (that) includes robbery, drug possession with intent to sell, possession of a deadly weapon, malicious destruction and theft.” She did not indicate if those were arrests, charges or convictions.\n\nCourt records indicate Gibson’s legal history shows only the one felony in 2008, along with a few traffic violations, minor drug arrests and an arrest for riding public transportation without paying the fare.\n\nThe Twin Cities — the latest target in President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement campaign — has been wracked by fear and anger in the aftermath of the killing of Renee Good, who was shot Jan. 7 during a confrontation with agents. On Wednesday, a man was shot and wounded by an immigration officer who had been attacked with a shovel and broom handle.",

    "fullText": "A U.S. citizen on her way to a medical appointment in Minneapolis was dragged out of her car and detained by immigration officers, according to a statement released by the woman on Thursday, after a video of her arrest drew millions of views on social media.\n\nAliya Rahman said she was brought to a detention center where she was denied medical care and lost consciousness. The Department of Homeland Security said she was an agitator who was obstructing ICE agents conducting arrests in the area.\n\nThat video is the latest in a deluge of online content that documents an intensifying immigration crackdown across the midwestern city, as thousands of federal agents execute arrests amid protests in what local officials have likened to a \"federal invasion.”\n\nRahman said that she was on her way to a routine appointment at the Traumatic Brain Injury Center when she encountered federal immigration agents at an intersection. Video appears to show federal immigration agents shouting commands over a cacophony of whistles, car horns and screams from protesters.\n\nIn the video, one masked agent smashes Rahman's passenger side window while others cut her seatbelt and drag her out of the car through the driver's side door. Numerous guards then carried her by her arms and legs towards an ICE vehicle.\n\n“I'm disabled trying to go to the doctor up there, that's why I didn't move,” Rahman said, gesturing down the street as officers pulled her arms behind her back.\n\nRahman was caught in a “terrible and confusing position” and had “no where to go,” according to Alexa Van Brunt, Rahman's attorney and director of the MacArthur Justice Center.\n\n“Her only options were to move her car forward in the direction of ICE officers and risk being accused of trying to harm them—which led to Renee Good’s death—or stay stationary, which in the end led to physical violence and abuse,” Van Brunt wrote in a statement.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security disputed that account in an emailed statement on Thursday, saying that Rahman was an agitator who “ignored multiple commands by an officer to move her vehicle away from the scene.” She was arrested along with six other people the department called agitators, one of whom was accused of jumping on an officer's back.\n\nThe department did not specify if Rahman was charged or respond to questions about her assertion that she was denied medical treatment.\n\nBarrage of viral videos draw scrutiny\n\nThe video of Rahman's arrest is one of many that have garnered millions of views in recent days — and been scrutinized amid conflicting accounts from federal officials and civilian eyewitnesses.\n\nOften, what's in dispute pertains to what happened just before or just after a given recording. But many contain common themes: Protesters blowing whistles, yelling or honking horns. Immigration officers breaking vehicle windows, using pepper spray on protesters and warning observers not to follow them through public spaces. Immigrants and citizens alike forcibly pulled from cars, stores or homes and detained for hours, days or longer.\n\nIn one video, heavily armed immigration agents used a battering ram to break through the front door of Garrison Gibson’s Minneapolis home, where his wife and 9-year-old child also were inside. The video shot inside the home captures a woman’s voice asking, “Where is the warrant?” and, “Can you put the guns down? There is kids in this house.”\n\nAnother video shows ICE agents, including Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, detain two employees at a Target store in Richfield, Minnesota. Both are U.S. citizens who were later released, according to social media posts from family members.\n\nMonica Bicking, 40, was leaving the homeless shelter where she works as a nurse when she took a video that appears to show a federal agent kneeing a man at least five times in the face while several other agents pin him facedown on the pavement in south Minneapolis.\n\nBicking works full time, so she says she doesn’t intentionally attend organized protests or confrontations with ICE. But she has started to carry a whistle in case she encounters ICE agents on her way to work or while running errands, which she says has become commonplace in recent weeks.\n\n“We’re hypervigilant every time we leave our houses, looking for ICE, trying to protect our neighbors, trying to support our neighbors, who are now just on lockdown,” Bicking said.\n\nRahman said in her statement that after her detainment, she felt lucky to be alive.\n\n“Masked agents dragged me from my car and bound me like an animal, even after I told them that I was disabled,\" Rahman said.\n\nWhile in custody, Rahman said she repeatedly asked for a doctor, but was instead taken to the detention center.\n\n“It was not until I lost consciousness in my cell that I was finally taken to a hospital,” Rahman said.\n\nRahman was treated for injuries consistent with assault, according to her counsel, and has been released from the hospital.\n\nShe thanked the emergency department staff for their care.\n\n“They gave me hope when I thought I was going to die.”",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Liberian man arrested over the weekend after heavily armed immigration agents used a battering ram to break through the front door of his Minneapolis home had been checking in regularly with federal authorities for years, his attorney said Tuesday.\n\nThe arrest of Garrison Gibson, 37 during a Minnesota immigration crackdown that the Department of Homeland Security has called its largest enforcement operation ever, was a “blatant constitutional violation,” since the agents did not have a proper warrant, said attorney Marc Prokosch.\n\nThe arrest Sunday came in a city increasingly on edge after an immigration agent shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good last week, setting off waves of angry protests and clashes between authorities and activists.\n\n“This was an illegal search, absolutely,” said Prokosch, because agents had brought only an administrative warrant, which authorizes someone’s arrest but does not allow officers to forcibly enter private homes. Forced entry requires a criminal warrant signed by a judge.\n\nGibson, who fled the Liberian civil war as a child, had been ordered removed from the U.S., apparently because of a 2008 drug conviction that was later dismissed by the courts. But he had remained in the country legally under what’s known as an order of supervision, with the requirement that he meet regularly with immigration authorities.\n\nOnly days before his arrest, Gibson had checked in with immigration authorities at regional immigration offices — the same building where agents have been staging enforcement raids in recent weeks.\n\n“He would have had another check-in in a couple of months,” Prokosch said. “So if he’s this dangerous person, then, why are they letting him walk around?\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Homeland Security Department, said earlier this week that Gibson has “a lengthy rap sheet (that) includes robbery, drug possession with intent to sell, possession of a deadly weapon, malicious destruction and theft.” She did not indicate if those were arrests, charges or convictions.\n\nMcLaughlin did not respond to questions about whether the agents’ use of force was justified.\n\nBut court records indicate Gibson’s legal history — dominated by a few traffic violations, minor drug arrests and an arrest for riding public transportation without paying the fare — shows only one felony, the 2008 conviction for third-degree narcotics sales that was later dismissed.\n\nProkosch said Gibson had been flown to Texas by immigration authorities in the hours after his arrest, then quickly flown back to Minnesota on a judge's order after the lawyer filed a habeas corpus petition, used by courts to determine if an imprisonment is legal. The courts have not yet ruled on the petition.\n\nGibson is currently being held at an immigration detention center in Albert Lea, Minnesota, after being held at a large camp on the Fort Bliss Army base in El Paso, Texas. according to ICE’s detainee locator.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not respond to an email from The Associated Press with follow-up questions about Gibson's case.\n\nGuns, activists and pepper spray\n\nGibson’s wife, Teyana Gibson Brown, a nurse who was inside the home with the couple's 9-year-old child during the raid, was deeply shaken by the arrest, Prokosch said.\n\nDuring their conversations, she “was having a hard time just completing sentences because she’s just been so distraught,” he said.\n\nActivists who had been keeping watch on the immigration agents before Gibson's arrest banged on drums, blew whistles and honked car horns in attempts to disrupt the operation and warn neighbors, some of whom poured into the streets.\n\nVideo taken at the scene by the AP shows agents pushing and pepper-spraying demonstrators.\n\nThe Twin Cities — the latest target in President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement campaign — has been convulsed by the killing of Good, who was shot Jan. 7 during a confrontation with agents.\n\nThe Trump administration has defended the officer who shot Good in her car, saying he was protecting himself and fellow agents and that Good had “weaponized” her vehicle.\n\nCity and state officials have dismissed those explanations based on videos of the confrontation.\n\nState and local authorities are urging the public to share video and any other evidence as they seek to investigate Good’s death after federal authorities insisted they would work on their own and not share information.\n\nMore than 2,000 immigration arrests have been made in Minnesota since the enforcement operation began at the beginning of December, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told Fox News over the weekend that the administration would send additional federal agents to the state to protect immigration officers and continue enforcement.\n\nAP correspondent Elliot Spagat contributed to this report from San Diego.",

    "description": "Illinois and Minnesota sued the Trump administration over its immigration crackdown. But they have a tough road ahead of them in court, one legal analyst says.",
    "fullText": "Over the last several months, Chicago, Minneapolis and St. Paul have seen a dramatic escalation in federal immigration enforcement along their chilly streets, with agents arresting thousands – including some US citizens – in neighborhoods, shopping centers, schools and at protests.\n\nThe surge is the result of the Trump administration’s commitment to cracking down on immigration, concentrated in Democratic-led cities, and follows weeks of growing tensions between the federal government and local Midwestern officials who have long implored for an end to the operations.\n\nIllinois and Minnesota, joined by their city counterparts, are now separately pursuing legal action against the administration, filing lawsuits Monday in federal courts over immigration enforcement they call unlawful and unconstitutional.\n\nA judge decided not to issue a temporary restraining order in the Minnesota lawsuit during a status conference Wednesday morning, but said her decision “should not be considered a prejudgment.”\n\nThe lawsuit presents “somewhat frontier issues in constitutional law,” US District Judge Katherine Menendez said. A hearing has not yet been scheduled in Illinois.\n\nThe road ahead for both suits appears dim, with their likelihood for success small, one expert says.\n\nElie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor and CNN senior legal analyst, has closely followed the turmoil in Chicago and the Twin Cities. Here, he breaks down the lawsuits, their merits and what’s next in the courtrooms.\n\nSome of the answers have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nCNN: What are Illinois and Minnesota asking for from judges in their lawsuits?\n\nHonig: Fundamentally, both of these states are asking federal judges to block Immigration and Customs Enforcement from enforcing immigration law in their states and cities. There are variations between them, but that’s the core ask. As a backup, both states ask the courts for some sort of ruling or declaration that some of the tactics ICE is using are unconstitutional.\n\nCNN: What are the key differences between the lawsuits?\n\nHonig: The main difference is that Illinois asks to block all ICE activity in the state, whereas Minnesota phrases its ask as seeking to stop this “surge” of officers. But pointing to the surge is legally irrelevant, because whether you’re talking about a group of ICE agents who are already there, or who were added after some point, the fundamental ask is still the same. You’re still asking a judge to block ICE from doing its job as it sees fit in your state.\n\nCNN: What is the legal precedent for an ask like that?\n\nHonig: None. There is no example, nor does either state cite an example in their papers, of a judge prohibiting a federal law enforcement agent from enforcing federal law in a given state. The reaction that we’ve heard from various Minnesota officials, including Attorney General Keith Ellison, when confronted with this lack of precedent and lack of case law, is essentially, “Well, this is really bad, though. Well, this is an invasion.” There is plenty of dramatic language in the complaints, but that doesn’t change the legal calculus. You can’t just take a situation that has no legal precedent and no legal support and say, “Well, yes, but our situation is really, really bad, therefore we get to invent new law.”\n\nCNN: In your opinion, how strong do you think the states’ arguments are?\n\nHonig: I think the arguments that both states are making, that ICE should be blocked, either entirely or just the surge, are close to completely meritless. Fundamentally, what they’re asking for is legally completely unwarranted.\n\nCNN: What do you think is the most likely outcome for each suit?\n\nHonig: It’s so dependent on the judge here. But I think the best, realistic scenario for the states is – if they get sympathetic judges who decide to put ICE through its paces – maybe they call in ICE agents as witnesses, or ICE officials as witnesses, probe into ICE’s training, policies and tactics and issue some sort of declaration that ICE needs to do things differently or better. Some sort of window dressing like that is probably the best realistic outcome. There’s no way a judge is going to say, “I hereby block you, ICE, from carrying out enforcement activities.” And if a judge does do that, it’ll be reversed.\n\nCNN: What are the legal principles at play here on the other side?\n\nHonig: First, it’s the Supremacy Clause, which says that the state and local authorities cannot block the feds from carrying out their federal duties. And also Article Two, which gives the federal executive branch the power to enforce federal law. Those are the legal theories that really are in play here.\n\nCNN: If the states’ chances of winning are close to zero, what can be done?\n\nHonig: I’m not saying there’s nothing to be done. This is just not the way to address any abuses or excesses by ICE. If a person has his or her rights violated, if a search is unlawful, if a person is wrongly detained, if a person is injured or killed wrongly by ICE, they can sue. They can go to court and seek specific redress for their specific injuries. What the courts are not supposed to do, first of all, is prohibit the federal executive branch from carrying out federal executive branch prerogatives and, secondly, issue blanket theoretical advisory rulings about the way the world ought to look or ought not to look. Cases need to be about specific injury and specific redress, and these lawsuits are not that.\n\nCNN: Illinois and Chicago sued the Trump administration in October 2025 after it federalized and tried to deploy the Illinois National Guard, also arguing in part that it violated the 10th Amendment. The state was successful in that case and Trump has largely backed off National Guard deployment there for now. What are the key differences between that case and this one over immigration enforcement?\n\nHonig: The National Guard was an entirely different case where Trump used a specific law, Section 12406, to deploy the National Guard. The Supreme Court offered a very specific and nuanced definition of the term “regular forces,” and whether that meant regular law enforcement forces, or regular military forces. So that case was based on the action Trump took that was based on a specific federal statute, and the Supreme Court construed and defined that statute against the Trump administration. Legally, it’s a completely different scenario from what we have here.\n\nCNN: Illinois and Minnesota filed their suits Monday; the latter also filing a temporary restraining order request. What happens now?\n\nHonig: One of two things. One, the judges can just reject these out of hand. I think that’s unlikely. I think the judges are going to want to hear further from the parties. The judges might decide to hold fact-finding hearings, they might decide, “I want to dig into what ICE is doing a bit.” That’s all within the broad discretion of these district court judges. I think those are the next steps, but if a district court judge is to say, “ICE, you can’t go in there, you can’t go into that state, you can’t go into that city,” I think that will get reversed real quick.\n\nCNN: Is there a timeline we can anticipate here for how quickly the judges may act on these lawsuits?\n\nHonig: Judges are in charge of handling their own dockets and calendars. I would assume judges would understand that these are fairly immediate and emergent issues and would want to get the parties in court within days, not months.",

    "description": "Simon Foster says he will give report into force’s handling of Maccabi Tel Aviv fan ban ‘careful consideration’ in deciding Craig Guildford’s fate\nHere are extracts from three interesting comment articles about the digital ID U-turn.\nAilbhe Rea in the New Statesman in the New Statesmans says there were high hopes for the policy when it was first announced.\nI remember a leisurely lunch over the summer when a supporter of digital IDs told me how they thought Keir Starmer would reset his premiership. Alongside a reorganisation of his team in Number 10, and maybe a junior ministerial reshuffle, they predicted he would announce in his speech at party conference that his government would be embracing digital IDs. “It will allow him to show he’s willing to do whatever it takes to tackle illegal immigration,” was their rationale.",
    "fullText": "Simon Foster, the Labour West Midlands police and crime commissioner (PCC), has indicated that he will not sack Craig Guildford, the chief constable, on the basis of the report out today.\n\nIn a statement, Foster says that he understands, and shares, the concerns expressed by many people about the force’s handling of the Maccabi Tel Aviv fan ban. But he also signals that it would be wrong to rush to judgment.\n\nHe says he did not get the Andy Cooke report in advance, and that he wants to give it “careful and detailed consideration”.\n\nHe also points out that Cooke is due to publish a further, final report on West Midlands police, and that in his letter (or preliminary report) published today he says his views may “develop or change” as more information comes in.\n\nHe says the Commons home affairs committee has not published its report yet.\n\nIt is my statutory duty to hold the chief constable to account for the totality of policing in the West Midlands.\n\nIn order to give all these issues full and proper consideration, I will be taking this matter to a meeting of my accountability and governance board, held in public, on Tuesday 27 January 2026 and asking questions of the chief constable.\n\nIn consideration of these matters, it is vital that all involved act in accordance with due process and the law at all times.\n\nThe reference to “totality of policing” may be significance. As Vikram Dodd has reported, in some respects Guildford, who became chief constable in 2022, has a good record. The force is now solving 15% of crime, up from 3% when he took over. “Violent crime is down, and times to answer emergency calls, which were among the worst in the country, are now among the best,” Dodd says.",

Do you share those concerns?\n\nA: We share them, and we already have teams of both senators and lawyers looking at every way that Trump could try to screw things up, and we’re fighting against it. We already have a team to make sure that they count the votes fairly. And, remember, still, a lot of the election mechanisms are done by the states. And even in red states, there’s resistance to Trump interfering.\n\nTrump will do whatever it takes, and he has no honor and no credibility and no respect for law. But, we are prepared for it, and we believe we will succeed.\n\nInfluence of ICE raids on election\n\nQ: What impact do you think the Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids are having on the midterms early on?\n\nA: People don’t like chaos. They see that cities and mayors who were perfectly calm and safe are now undergoing all of this chaos. And, you know, as I said, cost is number one. But it’s costs, corruption and chaos. The people don’t like it. And Trump, at the same time he's saying he wants to protect the protesters in Iran, he is going after protesters and other innocent civilians in Minneapolis. Makes no sense to people.\n\nQ: Does it seem to you like economic factors that are dissatisfying to a lot of the voting public are durable in this election year?\n\nA: Absolutely. The number one thing that bothers American families is they can't pay all the bills.\n\nThe costs is the number one issue. The cost of living, affordability, call it what you will. But it’s the number one issue, and now they realize that Trump is screwing them up on all of this.\n\nOn health care, with not extending the ACA tax credits, on energy, by getting rid of clean energy, wind and solar, raising their electric bills with tariffs, which is making the price of everything go up. So, people now realize that Trump is hurting them.\n\nWe are going to focus on five issues in terms of lowering people’s costs. They are health care, housing, tariffs — you know, costs of goods — food prices, because of food monopolies, and child care.\n\nTrump and the Republicans are in a bubble, and they don't understand it. They are ignoring it, and that's why things keep getting better and better for us.\n\nMidterm congressional environment\n\nQ: If we are looking at, in the House, 25 to 30 seats changing hands, is there a direct correlation to what can happen in the Senate?\n\nA: Look, at the beginning of (last) year, people said, “Well, there's a chance to win the House and no chance to win the Senate.” But because of the issues that I've talked about and because the House and Senate have been largely in sync on those issues and it's resonating with the American people how we're on their side, I think that the difference between the likelihood of winning the House and the likelihood of winning the Senate has greatly decreased.\n\nQ: Yet at this very moment, at the beginning of the midterm year, would you agree that Democrats have a narrow path back to the Senate majority?\n\nA: I say it is a much wider path than the skeptics think, and a much wider path than it was three months ago and certainly a year ago. And it keeps getting better and better, and we think we have a really good chance of winning back the Senate.\n\nYounger, non-white Trump voters\n\nQ: Younger and non-white voters drifted toward Trump in the last election, as you know. What is your plan, and what will it take for Democrats to win them over?\n\nA: The cost issue is really having an effect already. Look at the elections of 2025. Look at how (Democrat Abigail) Spanberger won by 15 points in Virginia and (Democrat Mikie) Sherrill won by 13 points (in 2025 governor's races). But it wasn't just those two states. We won elections in Georgia. We won elections across the country. And that is because voters, young and old, poor and middle class, don't think Trump was serving them well. So, there's been a whole turnaround about Trump.\n\nAnd in large part, we helped make it happen by focusing on costs.\n\nBeaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.",

Homeland Security refused to release more information, unless the tribe “entered into an immigration agreement with ICE.”\n\nDHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday evening.\n\nStar Comes Out said the tribe has no plans enter an agreement with ICE.\n\nIn a post to his Facebook page, Star Comes Out said that the four detained tribal members are experiencing homelessness and living under a bridge in Minneapolis. One of the members was released from detention.\n\nIn the press release, he demanded information on the status of the three men in detention, the release of all tribal citizens in ICE custody and a meeting between the tribe and the government.\n\nFort Snelling has a troubling history for Indigenous people. It was the first military outpost in the area, and Dakota people were held prisoner there during the Dakota War of 1862, an armed conflict between the U.S. and Native Americans, said Nick Estes, an associate professor in American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota and a member of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe.\n\n“It has this really notorious anti-Indigenous, specifically anti-Dakota, history,” Estes said. “It’s kind of like a continuation on the monopoly of violence from the military outpost to the ICE facility.”\n\nIt's not the first time in recent months that ICE agents have detained tribal members.\n\nLast year, elected leaders in the Navajo Nation said that tribal citizens in Arizona and New Mexico reported being stopped and detained by ICE officers. In November, a member of the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community in Arizona who had been arrested in Iowa was mistakenly scheduled to be deported before the error was caught and she was released.\n\nThat same month, Elaine Miles, a member of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation in Oregon and an actress known for her roles in “Northern Exposure” and “The Last of Us,” said she was stopped by ICE officers in Washington state who told her that her tribal ID looked fake.\n\nIndigenous rights groups as well as the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians have established places in Minneapolis where tribal citizens can apply for tribal ID cards, in case they are approached by ICE and need to provide identification.\n\n“I never thought that I’d have my tribal ID hanging around my neck, but I do,” said Mary LaGarde, executive director of the Minneapolis American Indian Center. “So, it’s just important that they have proper identification on them and not to panic.”",

    "fullText": "As the Trump administration intensifies immigration enforcement nationwide, a wave of high-profile arrests — many unfolding at private homes and businesses and captured on video — has pushed one legal question into the center of the national debate: When can federal immigration agents lawfully enter private property to make an arrest?\n\nThat question has taken on new urgency in cities like Minneapolis, where thousands of federal agents are operating on the streets amid protests, confrontations and a fatal shooting, sharpening scrutiny of the legal authority immigration officers rely on when they arrive at the front door.\n\nAt the heart of the debate is a legal distinction largely unfamiliar to the public but central to immigration enforcement.\n\nMost immigration arrests are carried out under administrative warrants, internal documents issued by immigration authorities that authorize the arrest of a specific individual but do not permit officers to forcibly enter private homes or other non-public spaces without consent. Only criminal warrants signed by judges carry that authority. Legal experts say the administration’s aggressive enforcement push, combined with public awareness of those limits, is increasingly turning door-knock encounters into flashpoints, fueling confrontations that are now playing out in cities across the country.\n\nHere is what to know about the limitations on the warrants that authorize most immigration related arrests.\n\nImmigration warrants typically don't authorize entry onto private property\n\nAll law enforcement operations — including those conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection — are governed by the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects all people in the country from unreasonable searches and seizures. That means law enforcement is required to have a warrant before searching one's private property or arresting someone, regardless of immigration status.\n\nBut not all warrants are the same. Typically, arrests carried out by Department of Homeland Security agencies are authorized by administrative warrants — sometimes known as immigration warrants — not judicial warrants.\n\nJudicial warrants are issued by a court and signed by a magistrate or a state or federal judge. These warrants allow a relevant law enforcement agency to apprehend a specified individual in any context — regardless of whether the person is on public or on private property. In other words, law enforcement is legally allowed to enter and search a home or business to make the arrest without the consent of the property owner once a judge signs off on the arrest.\n\nThat means people can legally refuse federal immigration agents entry into private property if the agents only have an administrative warrant.\n\nThere are limited exceptions, some of which include if someone is in immediate danger, an officer is actively chasing a suspect or if someone is calling for help inside the residence. But those exceptions don't apply in routine immigration arrests, legal experts say.\n\nJohn Sandweg, a former ICE acting director, said officers are trained on what circumstances legally justify forced entry. But as the scope of ICE's work has expanded, and more Border Patrol agents have begun conducting the work of ICE officers, there is a greater chance that agents will misapply the rules, he said.\n\n“Your risks of all of these types of incidents increase dramatically when you take officers out of their normal operating environment and ask them to do things that they have not been trained to do, because it’s not part of their core missions,” Sandweg said.\n\nMounting tensions in Minneapolis\n\nThe thorny legal distinction between judicial and administrative warrants came to the fore on Sunday when immigration law enforcement raided a private home to make an arrest in Minneapolis, after clashing with protesters who confronted the heavily armed agents. Documents reviewed by The Associated Press revealed that the agents only had an administrative warrant — meaning there was no judge that authorized the raid on private property.\n\nWhen asked, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin didn't provide a legal justification for the forced entry and arrest of the man, who is a Liberian national with a deportation order from 2023. She said his arrest was part of the administration's efforts to arrest “the worst of the worst” and added that he had that a criminal history including “robbery, drug possession with the intent to sell, possession of a deadly weapon, malicious destruction and theft.\"\n\nMcLaughlin didn't specify whether he was convicted of any of those crimes, or whether his arrest was related to any criminal activity.\n\nVice president of policy at the National Immigration Law Center, Heidi Altman, said she couldn’t comment on that specific raid, but said that generally an officer entering a home without consent or permission could result in serious consequences.\n\n“That is not just an illegal arrest. It’s numerous illegal actions by the officer themselves that could open up liability, not just for being sued, but potential criminal actions under state law as well,” she explained.\n\nBut in the current political climate, Altman said, it isn’t clear if there are any realistic avenues for accountability since the federal government would be responsible for investigating such a breech.\n\n“There are layers of federal laws and regulations and policies prohibiting this kind of behavior. But then the second layer is: Is the federal government going to impose consequences?\" she said.\n\nOn top of that, immigrants have less recourse after an illegal arrest or search, since the illegally obtained evidence can still be used in immigration court. It’s called the exclusionary rule, Altman explained, and the consequences that the officer may face would not undo the immediate consequences immigrants could face if they are quickly deported.\n\n“As those legal challenges come and people are facing very, very quick detentions and deportations on the basis of these illegal arrests, there’s very little recourse in actual immigration court proceedings that allows people to have a judge disregard evidence or the actual arrest, even if it was done in this very violent, illegal manner,” Altman said.\n\nICE has long relied on “knock and talks\" to make apprehensions, informally requesting residents to leave a home without giving any indication they plan to make an immigration arrest. As outlined in a 2020 lawsuit in which a federal judge found the practice illegal, officers tell their targets that they need them to step outside to answer a few questions. In one case, they told a woman that they were probation officers looking for her brother.\n\nIn response, activists, lawyers and local governments have launched “know-your-rights” campaigns around the country, attempting to educate people on the legal nuances of the extremely convoluted legal framework that is supposed to govern immigration law enforcement.\n\nMany groups have published fact sheets and infographics on social media, while others facilitate meetings that go over constitutional protections that immigrants have — regardless of legal status — in interactions with federal agents.\n\nOften groups will instruct immigrants to request to see a warrant before opening the door if an immigration officer knocks. The trainings also typically emphasize that an immigrant can refuse to open the door if law enforcement only has an administrative warrant.",

    "fullText": "Jan 13 - Video of a U.S. immigration agent fatally shooting a Minneapolis mother in her car on Wednesday has divided the nation, becoming a political Rorschach test that elicits different verdicts depending on who views it.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his administration have defended the agent and branded 37-year-old Renee Good a domestic terrorist. Local leaders and protesters across ​the country have condemned the shooting, saying the fact that Good turned her wheels away from the officer as she drove past him proved her peaceful intentions.\n\nSince the shooting last Wednesday, Reuters ‌has spoken to six Americans who voted for Trump in 2024 - part of a group of 20 whom Reuters has interviewed monthly since February - to better understand how they assess an incident caught on video that has been viewed by millions.\n\nEach of these half-dozen voters, ‌who vary in their assessments of Trump's immigration policy and overall performance, came away from the video with the same conclusion: The agent feared for his life and his decision to shoot Good was justifiable.\n\nTheir verdict mirrors that of the Trump administration. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told reporters hours after the incident that Good had refused agents’ orders to move and then “proceeded to weaponize her vehicle.” Trump said on social media that the woman \"ran over the ICE Officer.\"\n\nMany Americans disagree. Tens of thousands of people marched through Minneapolis this weekend to decry the killing and the city's mayor, Jacob Frey, called the Trump administration's assessment \"bullshit.\" Frey said the video showed an \"agent recklessly using power that resulted ⁠in somebody dying, getting killed.\"\n\nBut the video left all six voters convinced that ‌the agent shot Good because he thought she was trying to kill him. All expressed sympathy for the stressful conditions under which ICE and other law enforcement officers work, and many blamed Democratic leaders for inflaming anti-ICE sentiment, thereby making agents fear attacks from members of the public.\n\nAmanda Taylor, 52, an insurance firm employee near Savannah, Georgia, ‍who considers herself \"always pro-police,\" said the agent was \"protecting the community and protecting himself\" when he fired at Good.\n\nTaylor, who voted for Democratic President Joe Biden in 2020 and has had mixed feelings about Trump's economic policies and governing style, said the moment in the video when Good defied agents' orders to stop her car showed the agent she was a potential public threat.\n\n\"If they're running from you, what else are they gonna do?\" she said.\n\nThe first videos to widely circulate showed two ​masked officers approaching Good's car, which was stopped at a perpendicular angle on a Minneapolis street. As one officer ordered Good out of the car and grabbed at her door handle, the car briefly reversed ‌and then began driving forward, turning to the right.\n\nAnother officer, since identified as Jonathan Ross, was positioned in front of her car on the left. He drew his gun and fired three times, with the last shots aimed through the driver's side window. How much contact the car made with the officer, who stayed on his feet, has been widely debated.\n\nSeveral other voters also argued that Good's own actions led to her death. \"When I saw the video only one word came to mind, and that is 'disrespectful': another person failed to respect the law,\" said Herman Sims, 66, a night operations manager for a trucking company in Dallas, Texas.\n\n\"We won't ever know what would have happened if she kept going. Would she have run over someone else in the street blocks away?\" Sims said.\n\nChad Hill, 50, a supervisor at a nuclear power plant near his home in northwestern Ohio, ⁠also said the ICE agent was \"100% correct\" to use deadly force against Good once she had ignored officers' orders to ​stop.\n\n\"Putting a vehicle in drive and moving it toward a law enforcement officer is the same as drawing and pointing a gun,\" ​Hill said. He added that the \"political landscape in liberal cities has demonized ICE agents\" for merely doing their jobs.\n\n\"There is no doubt in my mind it was self-defense,\" said Jon Webber, 45, a Walmart retail worker in Indiana who fully supports Trump's immigration crackdown. \"The moment she threw her car in [drive] and revved up, even if she was trying to ‍avoid the ICE agents, she came way too close.\"\n\nEven ⁠voters who had mixed feelings about the administration’s deportation drive felt the agent should not face legal consequences.\n\nDon Jernigan, 75, has previously told Reuters that some footage of ICE raids reminds him of Nazi Germany. But after viewing video of this incident, the Virginia Beach retiree said he thinks the ICE agent who shot Good should not be prosecuted, just retrained.\n\n\"When he was out of the way ⁠and she was beside him, yes, indeed, he shouldn't have shot at her,\" said Jernigan. \"But at that point, he didn't know. All he knew was somebody tried to kill him.\"\n\nAlthough Lou Nunez, 83, shares Jernigan's qualms about the aggressive tactics some ICE agents have ‌used during raids, he said he would not prosecute the one who shot Good. The Des Moines-based veteran said the officers \"work in a pressure-cooker situation\" and that the onus was on ‌Good to follow their orders.",

    "description": "The Customs and Border Protection officers are joining 2,000 other officers and agents at the Department of Homeland Security who have recently been deployed to the Minneapolis region.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration is sending roughly 1,000 more immigration officers to Minnesota, expanding its law enforcement surge in the state and potentially escalating already tense relations between federal and local officials in Minneapolis.\n\nThe Customs and Border Protection officers are joining 2,000 other officers and agents at the Department of Homeland Security who have been deployed to the Minneapolis-St. Paul region recently, said Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the department. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said last week that the effort was its “largest operation to date.”\n\nLocal officials in Minneapolis have urged federal forces to leave the city, saying their efforts to arrest immigrants were sowing chaos and danger. Protests have also erupted nationwide after the killing of Renee Good, a 37-year-old woman who was shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis last week. Ms. Good had been participating in a protest in response to immigration agents who had been spotted in the city.\n\nOn Monday, state and city officials in Minnesota and Illinois filed federal lawsuits against the Trump administration, arguing that the mass deployment of immigration officers to the Minneapolis and Chicago regions violated the U.S. Constitution. The Minnesota lawsuit asked a judge to block federal officials from “implementing the unprecedented surge” in the state.\n\nTrump administration officials have repeatedly defended their enforcement operations in both states.\n\nKristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said in an interview with Fox News on Sunday that the department was sending more immigration officers to the Minneapolis region, which would allow federal law enforcement there to work safely. Ms. Noem added that people who conducted “violent activities against law enforcement” or impeded operations would be held accountable.\n\n“We’re going to keep doing our jobs,” Ms. Noem said. “Criminal illegal aliens in this country are going to be brought to justice.”\n\nThe increase in immigration officers adds to an already massive federal law enforcement presence in the Minneapolis region. In comparison, the Minneapolis Police Department has roughly 600 officers.\n\nThe Trump administration has intensified its focus on Minnesota in recent weeks, saying it was “unleashing a relentless assault” on the state to root out fraud. Federal officials have also vowed to ramp up enforcement operations in other Democratic-led states including California and New York.\n\nThe administration’s focus on Minnesota follows fraud investigations into a pandemic-era program meant to feed children and other safety net programs in the state. More than 90 people, most of them of Somali origin, have been charged with felonies in recent years. President Trump has used xenophobic language to attack Somalis who are living in the United States, saying, “We don’t want them in our country.”\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said on Friday that it was reviewing thousands of refugee cases in Minnesota, subjecting immigrants who had already been approved for status to new interviews and background checks. Groups that provide assistance to refugees criticized the effort and said it was an unnecessary attempt to scrutinize immigrants who had already completed a thorough vetting process.\n\nThe Trump administration also said it would suspend funding for food stamps in Minnesota. A similar effort to freeze billions in federal funding for child care and social service programs in five Democratic-led states, including Minnesota, was temporarily blocked by a federal judge in New York last week.",

    "fullText": "The federal agent who shot and killed a driver in Minneapolis is an Iraq War veteran who has served for nearly two decades in the Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to records obtained Thursday by The Associated Press.\n\nJonathan Ross, who shot and killed Renee Good on Wednesday, has served as a deportation officer with ICE since 2015, records show. He was seriously injured last summer when he was dragged by the vehicle of a fleeing suspect whom he shot with a stun gun.\n\nFederal officials have not named the officer who shot Good, a 37-year-old mother who was shot as she tried to drive away from federal agents. But Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem said the agent who shot Good had been dragged by a vehicle last June, and a department spokesperson confirmed Noem was referring to the Bloomington, Minnesota, case in which documents identified the injured officer as Ross.\n\nNoem and other Trump administration officials have defended the agent as an experienced law enforcement professional who followed his training and shot Good after he believed she was trying to run him or other agents over with her vehicle. Video has raised questions about whether the shooting was in self-defense, and the FBI is investigating the deadly use of force. Some protesters are demanding that Ross face criminal charges, and Minnesota authorities also want to investigate.\n\nAttempts to reach Ross, 43, at phone numbers and email addresses associated with him were not immediately successful.\n\nHere are some things to know about him:\n\nExperienced military and law enforcement officer\n\nIn courtroom testimony last month, Ross said he deployed to Iraq from 2004 to 2005 with the Indiana National Guard. Ross said he served as a machine gunner on a gun truck as part of a combat patrol team.\n\nHe said he returned from Iraq in 2005, went to college and joined the Border Patrol in 2007 near El Paso, Texas. He worked there until 2015, serving as a field intelligence agent gathering and analyzing information on cartels and drug and human smuggling.\n\nRoss said he has served as a deportation officer based in Minnesota since he joined ICE in 2015. He is assigned to fugitive operations, seeking to arrest “higher value targets” in the ICE region that includes Minneapolis, he testified last month. He said that he was also a team leader with the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force.\n\n“So I develop the targets, create a target package, surveillance, and then develop a plan to execute the arrest warrant,” he said.\n\nRoss said that he was also a firearms instructor, an active shooter instructor, a field intelligence officer and member of the SWAT team. He said that he attended the Border Patrol’s academy in New Mexico, where he learned to speak Spanish.\n\nRoss was a leader of a team of agents who went to arrest a man who was in the U.S. illegally in the Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington on June 17. Agents had gathered outside the home of the man, Roberto Munoz-Guatemala, who left in his car, according to court records.\n\nFBI agents activated emergency sirens and lights instructing him to pull over but he did not. Ross pulled his vehicle diagonally in front of Munoz-Guatemala to force him to stop.\n\nRoss and an FBI agent identified themselves as police and pointed guns at Munoz-Guatemala, who raised his hands. Ross then approached Munoz-Guatemala’s vehicle and ordered him to put it in park.\n\nRoss told the driver to lower his window all the way down and warned that he would break it if he did not. Ross used a device known as a “spring-loaded window punch” to break the rear driver’s side window and reached inside the car to unlock the driver’s door.\n\nMunoz-Guatemela drove off while Ross’ arm was caught in the vehicle and accelerated, dragging Ross down the street. Ross fired his Taser, striking Munoz-Guatemala with prongs in the head, face and shoulder.\n\nMunoz-Guatemela was not incapacitated by the Taser, prosecutors said, and kept driving, taking Ross the length of a football field in 12 seconds. Ross was knocked free from the vehicle by force after Munoz-Guatemala drove onto a curb for a second time and back to the street.\n\nRoss’ right arm was bleeding, and an FBI agent applied a tourniquet. Eventually, he received dozens of stitches at a hospital. Prosecutors said he had “suffered multiple large cuts, and abrasions to his knee, elbow, and face.”\n\n“It was pretty excruciating pain,” Ross testified.\n\nMunoz-Guatemela was bleeding from his injuries and had a woman call 911, saying that he was assaulted and didn’t know whether the person trying to stop him was an officer. He was arrested and charged with assault on a federal officer with a dangerous or deadly weapon.\n\nA jury found Munoz-Guatemala guilty at a trial last month, finding he “should reasonably have known that Jonathan Ross was a law enforcement officer and not a private citizen attempting to assault him.”\n\nFederal officials defend the agent without identifying him\n\nVice President J.D. Vance praised the agent's service to the country Thursday without naming him, saying the ICE officer “deserves a debt of gratitude.”\n\n“This is a guy who’s actually done a very, very important job for the United States of America,” Vance said. “He’s been assaulted. He’s been attacked. He’s been injured because of it.”\n\nDHS assistant Tricia McLaughlin declined to confirm the agent's identity Thursday, saying doing so would be dangerous for the safety of him and his family. But she noted that he had been selected for ICE’s special response team, which includes a 30-hour tryout and additional training on specialized skills such as breaching techniques, perimeter control, hostage rescue and firearms.\n\n“He acted according to his training,” she said. “This officer is a longtime ICE officer who has been serving his country his entire life.”",

    "fullText": "Fox News anchor John Roberts appeared skeptical of part of Kristi Noem’s statement about an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer killing a 37-year-old mom in Minneapolis on Wednesday.\n\nNoem, the Department of Homeland Security secretary, asserted that the incident, which claimed the life of a U.S. citizen, who has since been identified as Renee Nicole Good, was related to an ICE vehicle getting stuck in the snow.\n\n“They got stuck in the snow because of the adverse weather that is in Minneapolis,” Noem, 54, insisted during a speech earlier Wednesday—a claim she reiterated during a press conference later that night.\n\n“They were attempting to push out their vehicle and a woman attacked them, and those surrounding them, and attempted to run them over and ram them with her vehicle,” Noem said.\n\nAs for Noem’s claim about the snow, Roberts wasn’t buying it.\n\n“I’ve seen the video several times as well—kind of gone through it frame by frame. I don’t want to describe it because you can’t see the entire scene play out,“ Roberts, 69, said.\n\n“There is an area in front of the vehicle that is obscured by the vehicle itself, so we don’t know 100 percent what happened during that incident, but what I saw of it does counteract the narrative that they were trying to push their car out of the snow—the ICE agents who were involved here, because that vehicle was clearly in the middle of the street, as it was approached by a couple of federal agents before it sped off.”\n\nAs for the rest of the incident, like how the officer—who DHS claims feared for his life—fired multiple shots at Good through her driver’s side window as the mom-of-one was driving away, Roberts merely stated that there are differing opinions.\n\n“We will wait until we get clearance to look at this video and have eyes that are more expert than mine take a look at it,” he said. “Clearly, there are very, very conflicting opinions of what happened. We have the one opinion from DHS, and then we have the other opinion from the mayor and local officials.”\n\nDHS has argued that the agent fired in self-defense after Good, the mother of a now-orphaned 6-year-old son, attempted to kill him with her car, despite witnesses saying and video showing otherwise.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz urged the public not to buy into the “propaganda machine” from DHS, which was found to have provided a false account of an agent shooting a Chicago woman in her car in 2025, as The New Republic reported.\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also pushed back on the DHS’s dubious version of events.\n\n“This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying,” he said in a news conference, adding that ICE should “get the f--- out of Minneapolis.”\n\n“We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some kind of safety, and you are doing exactly the opposite,” he continued. “People are being hurt. Families are being ripped apart. Long-term Minneapolis residents that have contributed so greatly to our city, to our culture, to our economy are being terrorized, and now somebody is dead. That’s on you, and it’s also on you to leave.”\n\nThis video is horrific. A full investigation is needed ASAP. Sure looks like ICE just killed that woman. https://t.co/nAUMjHvbkc\n\n— Jessica Tarlov (@JessicaTarlov) January 7, 2026\n\nLater on Wednesday, Fox News’ Jessica Tarlov had a stronger reaction than Roberts to the shooting, saying it looked “ICE just killed that woman.”\n\nThe Five co-host Harold Ford Jr. questioned Noem’s account as well.\n\n“I couldn’t understand when she said it was an act of ‘domestic terrorism’ and she said the car was stuck in snow, and the officers—I think her characterization, maybe she got bad information, because her characterization seemed inconsistent with what we are seeing here,” Ford said.\n\nWhen a colleague told Ford that Noem is working with Attorney General Pam Bondi to classify the act of ramming with a vehicle “domestic terrorism,” Ford said it didn’t seem to apply in this case.\n\n“Well, she might be, but those aren’t the facts,” he said. “She had the earliest comment about this. I’m just saying, her characterization of the facts doesn’t seem to be consistent with the video that we’re seeing. Maybe she’s seeing some other video.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to DHS for comment.",

    "title": "Bill to Eliminate H-1B Visa Program Introduced in Congress",
    "description": "The bill introduced by Marjorie Taylor Greene would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to eliminate the H-1B visa program.",
    "fullText": "A bill that would \"eliminate the H-1B program,\" which helps U.S. companies hire highly skilled foreign workers, was among Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene's final two final pieces of proposed legislation, new records show.\n\nThe Republican of Georgia introduced the bill and another to mandate \"photo identification and proof of United States citizenship to vote in Federal elections\" on Friday.\n\nShe served her final day in Congress for Georgia's 14th district on Monday, following her a high-profile break with President Donald Trump over issues such as health care, the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files and foreign policy.\n\nThe H1-B visa program has been under heavy scrutiny during President Trump's second term.\n\nIn September, Trump ordered a controversial $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas, sparking ongoing legal challenges. In court papers, Trump's administration argued the substantial increase is necessary to protect American jobs and fund border security, while critics—including some business groups, educators and state governments—warned it would stifle innovation, competitiveness, and specialized fields like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and medicine.\n\nGreene's bill goes one step further than the government's position, seeking to end the program entirely.\n\nThe clash brings to the forefront the challenges Trump faces as he seeks to balance economic pragmatism with the “America First” sentiments of his political base, which Greene has argued are being ignored by Trump's administration.\n\nThe H-1B visa program allows employers to sponsor foreign professionals for jobs that require specialized skills, most commonly in technology, engineering, and science.\n\nEach year, the government issues 85,000 new H-1B visas, including 20,000 reserved for workers with advanced degrees from U.S. universities. Demand for the visas regularly exceeds supply, triggering an annual lottery. Indian nationals make up a large share of recipients.\n\nGreene first touted a H-1B program ban in September, writing on X: \"I am introducing a bill to END the mass replacement of American workers by aggressively phasing out the H1B program. Big Tech, AI giants, hospitals, and industries across the board have abused the H-1B system to cut out our own people. Americans are the most talented people in the world, and I have full faith in the American people. I serve Americans only, and I will ALWAYS put Americans first.\"\n\nRepresentative Beth Van Duyne, the Republican of Texas, last month also called for a total ban on the visas as part of a broader push to overhaul the U.S. immigration system, telling conservative commentator Benny Johnson politicians had overlooked the “unintended consequences” of programs like H-1B.\n\nMeanwhile, a federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration may proceed with imposing a $100,000 fee on new H1B visa applications. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which brought a legal challenge over concerns the fee would disrupt the framework established by Congress and impose high costs on U.S. businesses, last week launched an appeal over the ruling.\n\n\"These harms to American businesses will also be a boon to America’s economic rivals, who will surely welcome the talent no longer able to accept work in the United States,\" the business group said in its initial October lawsuit. \"That is a competitive edge that foreign employers might never cede back.\"\n\nSeparately, a coalition of 20 states, spearheaded by Washington Attorney General Nick Brown and California and Massachusetts' Attorneys General, challenged the fee’s legality under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), arguing the required notice-and-comment process was bypassed, and the fee was arbitrarily set unrelated to administrative costs.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State expanded its screening process for H-1B applicants and their dependents last month, requiring applicants to make social media accounts publicly accessible as part of routine vetting. Officials said the move was aimed at preventing abuse of the system.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has finalized new rules that will reshape the H-1B visa lottery. Beginning in 2027, applicants would no longer have equal chances of selection; instead, the system would prioritize higher-paid workers within each occupation. Federal officials said the change is intended to favor highly skilled applicants and respond to concerns about visa misuse and the displacement of U.S. workers.\n\nRepresentative Beth Van Duyne, the Republican of Texas, told conservative commentator Benny Johnson on December 17: “That H-1B visa program has got to either stop right now until we understand the amount of just how it’s being taken advantage of, or redone so it doesn't exist.\"\n\nStuart Anderson, executive director at the National Foundation for American Policy, responding to a decline in the number of H-1B visas approved for Indian-based companies, according to a National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) analysis of government data, told Newsweek: \"H-1B visas are important because they are typically the only way to hire a high-skilled foreign national long term in the United States, and approximately 70% of full-time graduate students in key science and technology fields at U.S. schools are international students.”\n\nUnited States Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesperson Matthew Tragesser, in a December 23 press release announcing H-1B lotttery changes: \"The new weighted selection will better serve Congress’ intent for the H-1B program and strengthen America’s competitiveness by incentivizing American employers to petition for higher-paid, higher-skilled foreign workers. With these regulatory changes and others in the future, we will continue to update the H-1B program to help American businesses without allowing the abuse that was harming American workers.”\n\nGreen's amendment has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee, along with the Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means committees.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s bold claims that his policies delivered an unprecedented jobs boom for American-born workers are at odds with data showing a weaker market than under his predecessor.\n\nTrump, 79, has repeatedly boasted that all new job gains have gone to U.S.-born workers since he returned to office. “In the year before my election, all net creation of jobs was going to foreign migrants. Since I took office, 100 percent of all net job creation has gone to American-born citizens,” Trump said during an address to the nation last month. “One hundred percent.”\n\nAdministration officials have parroted that rhetoric, saying on X in November that what Trump “is doing for our workforce is nothing short of HISTORIC.”\n\n“While other Presidents allowed foreign workers to flood the job market, President Trump is working to ensure ALL jobs created go to our workers,” the U.S. Department of Labor’s X account posted.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s right-hand man, Vice President JD Vance, has been aggressively backing his government’s handling of the economy.\n\nJust last month, against the backdrop of pessimistic unemployment data, Vance graded Trump’s economic performance “A plus-plus-plus-plus.”\n\nHe has also praised the administration for “bringing jobs back to America.”\n\n“We had a policy in this country for 40 years of shipping American jobs overseas... There is going to be a massive exception to that 40-year trajectory of American decline, and that’s the second Trump admin,” he said in discussion with Breitbart’s Matthew Boyle in Washington, D.C.\n\nEconomists, however, are calling Trump’s bluff. Citing data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, The Washington Post reported Friday that the labor market itself has weakened, leaving U.S.-born workers modestly worse off than they had been under former President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.\n\n“The unemployment rate has been rising for both native-born and foreign-born adults,” Jed Kolko, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former Commerce Department economist, told the Post.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, unemployment among native-born workers was higher in late 2025 than a year earlier. The not seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for U.S.-born workers rose from 3.9 percent in November 2024 to 4.3 percent in November 2025.\n\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute, Trump’s claims that his immigration policies are creating job market opportunities for U.S.-born workers are “false and based on a misreading of data from the household survey.”\n\n“If anything, the job market for U.S.-born workers is worse so far in 2025 than it was in preceding years,” senior economist Ben Zipperer wrote in September.\n\nIn August, Jed Kolko, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and undersecretary for economic affairs at the US Department of Commerce under Biden, accused the president of committing a “multiple-count data felony” in trumpeting a jobs boom for native-born Americans.\n\nTaylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement to the Post that “mindless nitpicking doesn’t change the simple fact that President Trump has done more for American workers than any president in history by cracking down on visa program abuses, successfully negotiating new trade deals, securing our border, and carrying out the largest mass deportation of illegal aliens.”\n\nRogers said those policies ensure “American-born workers can finally benefit from our new economic resurgence.”",

    "fullText": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — U.S. immigration officials do not plan to detain Kilmar Abrego Garcia again as long as a judge’s order banning it stands, according to a Tuesday court filing.\n\nThe plans by President Donald Trump’s administration are the latest in the saga over the Salvadoran citizen’s case that has become a lightning rod for both sides of the immigration debate as he fights to remain in the U.S. after a mistaken deportation to his home country, where he was imprisoned.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement did make clear they would detain Abrego Garcia if the order was lifted, Liana J. Castano, assistant director for field operations, wrote in the filing.\n\nTrump officials have accused Abrego Garcia of being a member of the MS-13 gang, but he has vehemently denied the accusations and has no criminal record. The administration brought him back to the U.S. in June under a court order, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paula Xinis earlier this month questioned whether government officials could be trusted to follow orders barring them from taking Abrego Garcia back into immigration custody or deporting him.\n\nA Justice Department push to indict\n\nEarlier Tuesday, a newly unsealed order in the criminal case against Abrego Garcia revealed that high-level Justice Department officials pushed for his indictment, calling it a “top priority,” only after he was mistakenly deported and then ordered returned to the U.S.\n\nAbrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty in federal court to the human smuggling charges. He is seeking to have the case dismissed on the grounds that the prosecution is vindictive, arguing the Trump administration is targeting him as punishment for the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation.\n\nTo support that argument, he has asked the government to turn over documents that reveal how the decision was made to prosecute him in 2025 for an incident that occurred in 2022.\n\nAbrego Garcia had recently been in immigration custody for three months before Xinis ordered his release on Dec. 11. In that time, the government said it planned to deport him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Liberia.\n\nIn her Dec. 11 order, Xinis found that immigration officials had no viable plan to remove Abrego Garcia from the U.S. and said he could not be held indefinitely. She issued a separate order barring ICE from re-detaining him, at least for the time being. After a hearing on the issue, Xinis ordered the government to file the brief they released Tuesday outlining whether they planned to detain Abrego Garcia again.\n\nAbrego Garcia's human smuggling case stems from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee where he was pulled over for speeding with nine passengers in the car. State troopers discussed the possibility of human smuggling among themselves. However, he was ultimately allowed to leave with only a warning. The case was turned over to Homeland Security Investigations, but there is no record of any effort to charge him until April 2025, according to court records.\n\nThe newly unsealed Dec. 3 order from U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw compelled the government to provide some documents to Abrego Garcia and his attorneys, although it does not give a lot of detail on their contents.\n\nClaims of a ‘vindictive’ prosecution\n\nEarlier, Crenshaw found that there was “some evidence” that the prosecution of Abrego Garcia could be vindictive. He specifically cited a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on a Fox News program that seemed to suggest that the Department of Justice charged Abrego Garcia because he had won his wrongful deportation case.\n\nRob McGuire, who was the Acting U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee until late December, argued that those statements were irrelevant because he alone made the decision to prosecute, and he has no animus against Abrego Garcia.\n\nIn the unsealed order, Crenshaw writes, “Some of the documents suggest not only that McGuire was not a solitary decision-maker, but he in fact reported to others in DOJ and the decision to prosecute Abrego may have been a joint decision.”\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee released a statement saying: “The emails cited in Judge Crenshaw’s order, specifically Mr. McGuire’s email on May 15, 2025, confirm that the ultimate decision on whether to prosecute was made by career prosecutors based on the facts, evidence, and established DOJ practice. Communications with the Deputy Attorney General’s Office about a high-profile case are both required and routine.”\n\nThe email referenced was from McGuire to his staff saying Blanche “would like Garcia charged sooner rather than later,” according to Crenshaw's order.\n\nThe order also shows that Aakash Singh, who works under Blanche in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, contacted McGuire about Abrego Garcia's case on April 27, the same day that McGuire received a file on the case from Homeland Security Investigations. That was several days after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Abrego Garcia's favor on April 10.\n\nOn April 30, Singh said in an email to McGuire that the prosecution was a “top priority” for the Deputy Attorney General's Office, according to the order. Singh and McGuire continued to communicate about the prosecution. On May 18, Singh wrote to McGuire and others to hold the draft indictment until they got “clearance” to file it. “The implication is that ‘clearance’ would come from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General,” Crenshaw writes.\n\nA hearing on the motion to dismiss the human smuggling case on the basis of vindictive prosecution is scheduled for Jan. 28.",

    "description": "H-1B visa policy shifts in 2025 cause firms to reconsider staffing, use alternative visas, and update HR travel guidance.",
    "fullText": "Since September, the H-1B visa program has been caught in a whirlwind of changes.\n\nAs a result, companies nationwide are scrambling to determine their next steps, rewriting travel guidance for foreign workers, and lining up backup staffing plans, including shifting some work overseas, according to five immigration attorneys who spoke with Business Insider.\n\n\"Unpredictability is one of the number one enemies for business,\" said Rohit Srinivasa, an immigration attorney based in Los Angeles who works with startups and medium-sized tech companies.\n\nFirst came a $100,000 fee on new applications in September. Then came social media vetting requirements that left visa holders stranded abroad during the holidays. Now, a wage-based lottery system will favor the highest-paid applicants by giving them more chances in the annual H-1B lottery.\n\nImmigration lawyers say the constant policy shifts have companies tightening sponsorship guidelines, re-budgeting for higher costs, and gaming out contingency plans for a program that keeps changing shape.\n\nCompanies are taking a more calculated approach to who they sponsor for work visas and how they do so, attorneys told Business Insider.\n\nDivij Kishore, an immigration attorney at New York-based Flagship Law, which represents clients across various sectors, including tech, healthcare, and energy, told Business Insider that he has seen a 40% to 50% drop in H-1B sponsorship inquiries compared to previous years.\n\nTypically, by this time of the year, clients reach out with lists of employees they'd like to sponsor for the spring lottery, Kishore said.\n\n\"This year, that's not been the case because employers are just not sure what the costs are,\" Kishore said.\n\nOn the other hand, K. Edward Raleigh, a partner at immigration firm Fragomen, which represents some of Silicon Valley's largest tech companies, including Apple and Nvidia, told Business Insider that he hasn't seen a material slowdown in H-1B filings overall, as most are renewals for existing workers.\n\nStill, companies are \"tightening up their sponsorship guidelines\" and \"proceeding with caution, understanding that various things could trigger the fee,\" he said.\n\nThis recalculation is occurring despite the $100,000 fee having a narrow scope. It applies to new visa petitions for workers living abroad and does not apply to the vast majority of cases, such as foreign students already in the US switching from an academic visa to a work visa or existing H-1B holders changing employers.\n\n\"One of the main attributes of this administration is that they keep people guessing,\" said Ted Chiappari, who leads the immigration practice at law firm Duane Morris. \"Just because things are one way on Monday doesn't mean they're going to be the same way on Tuesday, and they won't switch back to things on Wednesday.\"\n\nFewer H-1B visas have been issued to Indian IT consulting firms, according to data from the National Foundation for American Policy, an Arlington-based nonprofit research organization focused on immigration and international trade.\n\nInstead, for the first time in the program's history, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google occupied the top four spots for H-1B approvals in fiscal year 2025, a shift that began before the recent policy upheaval. The trend suggests companies were already reassessing tech hiring strategies before the recent policy changes.\n\nDespite the turmoil, Srinivasa believes the H-1B will endure, saying the program is \"so baked in\" to the US economy, he said, that it's undergoing overhaul rather than replacement.\n\nSome sectors saw more impact than others. Universities and nonprofit healthcare organizations that have historically recruited professors and medical workers from abroad have largely stopped filing petitions subject to the fee, Chiappari said. Unlike for-profit companies, these institutions can hire H-1B workers throughout the year without going through the annual lottery.\n\n\"That pipeline is now dried up,\" Chiappari said.\n\nRather than abandoning H-1B sponsorship, companies are exploring alternative pathways and backup strategies.\n\nSrinivasa said interest in O-1 visas for workers with \"extraordinary ability\" has surged, though not everyone qualifies. To qualify, applicants typically need to demonstrate a track record of impact and achievements in their field as evidenced by patents, awards, membership in select associations, and media coverage about them.\n\nSome founders from countries with US trade treaties are turning to E-2 investor visas, which also provide work authorization for spouses. Others are using the EB-1C path, where companies send managers abroad for a year before bringing them back to the US.\n\nCompanies are also increasingly establishing international offices and using L-1 visas to transfer employees to the US, or opting for services like Deel and Rippling that serve as the official employer, handling immigration paperwork on behalf of client companies.\n\nBig Tech, as well as Wall Street firms such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, have been expanding their operations in Indian cities like Bengaluru and Hyderabad.\n\nKishore said some clients are preemptively reaching out to offshore providers to ramp up staffing capacity in case they are unable to bring workers to the US as planned.\n\n\"If they can't spend that same hundred dollars within the US next year, they will spend a hundred dollars outside the US,\" he added.\n\nStarting with the 2026 lottery, visa applications will be weighted based on salary level. Workers offered the highest wages will get four entries in the lottery, while those at the lowest tier get just one. The administration says this will ensure visas are awarded to the most skilled workers.\n\nRaleigh said companies are already thinking about how this will affect their recruitment strategy, \"without the exact terms of how those rules are going to work.\"\n\nThe change will likely benefit large tech companies that can afford to place workers in top salary bands, while creating challenges for smaller companies, nonprofits, and early-stage startups.\n\n\"Often the best startup founders forgo being paid a living wage because they're so dedicated to the mission,\" said Sophie Alcorn, a Bay Area immigration attorney who focuses on startups and entrepreneurs. \"Those same startups may be the ones that have the most difficulty in getting the right people through this future system.\"\n\nKishore said that a higher salary doesn't always mean more skill. A first-year associate at a major law firm might make $225,000, while an equally qualified associate at a smaller firm makes significantly less. Under the new system, the big-firm lawyer would have much better lottery chances, he said.\n\nSome attorneys are advising clients not to artificially inflate salaries to game the system. Chiappari said the spread between wage levels is typically $20,000 to $30,000 — far less than the $100,000 fee — and companies aren't rushing to increase compensation anyway.\n\nImmigration attorneys previously thought that the $100,000 fee might improve the chances for foreign students already studying in the US by increasing their chances if fewer companies enter candidates in the lottery. Now, the wage-based lottery means that it might not happen.\n\n\"That logic's been turned on its head,\" said Kishore, adding that students, who typically enter the workforce at lower salaries, will get fewer chances at the lottery.\n\nBeyond policy changes, companies are also recalibrating their compliance strategies to avoid triggering fees or violating new rules.\n\nRaleigh said that ensuring workers maintain valid immigration status has become even more critical, as any lapse could force someone to leave the country and return on a new H-1B visa, potentially triggering the $10,000 fee.\n\nCompanies are updating their HR policies, including guidance on social media presence for foreign hires, in response to new vetting requirements, Srinivasa said. Some are advising employees to avoid international travel altogether, even when technically permitted.\n\nChiappari said he still gets constant questions from worried H-1B holders about whether it's safe to travel internationally.\n\n\"Even if I write a three-page affidavit explaining how they're not going to have any trouble coming back to the United States, they're just not going to believe it, and they're staying here,\" Chiappari said. \"They're just not traveling.\"\n\nThe human cost is real: postponed weddings, skipped vacations, and delayed work travel.\n\n\"Employers,\" Kishore said, \"need to be prepared and agile for what's coming in the next few months.\"",

    "fullText": "CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Men who were part of the group of Venezuelan migrants that the United States government transferred earlier this year to a prison in El Salvador demanded justice on Friday, days after a federal judge in Washington ruled that the Trump administration must give them legal due process.\n\nThe men told reporters in Venezuela’s capital that they hope legal organizations can push their claims in court. Their press conference was organized by Venezuela’s government, which had previously said it had retained legal services for the immigrants.\n\nOn Monday, a federal judge ordered the U.S. government to give legal due process to the 252 Venezuelan men, either by providing court hearings or returning them to the U.S. The ruling opens a path for the men to challenge the Trump administration’s allegation that they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang and subject to removal under an 18th century wartime law.\n\nThe men have repeatedly said they were physically and psychologically tortured while at the notorious Salvadoran prison.\n\n“Today, we are here to demand justice before the world for the human rights violations committed against each of us, and to ask for help from international organizations to assist us in our defense so that our human rights are respected and not violated again,” Andry Blanco told reporters in Caracas, where roughly two dozen of the migrants gathered Friday.\n\nSome of the men shared the daily struggles they now face — including fear of leaving their home or encountering law enforcement — as a consequence of what they said were brutal abuses while in prison. The men did not specify what justice should look like in their case, but not all are interested in returning to the U.S.\n\n“I don’t trust them,” Nolberto Aguilar said of the U.S. government.\n\nThe men were flown to El Salvador in March. They were sent to their home country in July as part of a prisoner swap between the Trump administration and the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nCamilla Fabri, Venezuelan vice minister of foreign affairs for international communications, said Maduro's government is working with a bar association in the U.S. and “all human rights organizations to prepare a major lawsuit against Trump and the United States government, so that they truly acknowledge all the crimes they have committed against” the men.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge this week canceled the trial of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported, and scheduled a hearing on whether the prosecution is being vindictive in pursuing a human smuggling case against him.\n\nAbrego Garcia has become a centerpiece of the debate over immigration after the Trump administration deported him in March to a notorious prison in El Salvador. Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee.\n\nAbrego Garcia has denied the allegations, and argued that prosecutors are vindictively and selectively targeting him. Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr. wrote in Tuesday’s order that Abrego Garcia had enough evidence to hold a hearing on the topic, which Crenshaw scheduled for Jan. 28.\n\nAt that hearing, prosecutors will have to explain their reasoning for charging Abrego Garcia, Crenshaw wrote, and if they fail in that, the charges could be dismissed.\n\nWhen Abrego Garcia was pulled over in 2022, there were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security agent previously testified that he did not begin investigating the traffic stop until after the U.S. Supreme Court said in April that the Trump administration had to work to bring Abrego Garcia from El Salvador, where he was deported.\n\nYears earlier, Abrego Garcia had been granted protection from deportation to his home country after a judge found he faced danger there from a gang that targeted his family. That order allowed Abrego Garcia, who has an American wife and child, to live and work in the U.S. under Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervision.\n\nMembers of President Donald Trump’s administration have accused Abrego Garcia of being a member of the MS-13 gang, but he has vehemently denied the accusations and has no criminal record.\n\nAbrego Garcia's defense attorney and the U.S. attorney's office in Nashville did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "LONDON (AP) — On a Christmas Day when the war in Ukraine casts a shadow over Europe, concerns over immigration divide societies, and some politicians fan anger and resentment, Britain’s King Charles III called on people to focus on kindness instead of conflict.\n\nDelivering his annual holiday address from Westminster Abbey, Charles said Thursday the Christmas story of wise men and shepherds traveling through the night to find their savior shows how we can find strength in the “companionship and kindness of others.”\n\n“To this day, in times of uncertainty, these ways of living are treasured by all the great faiths and provide us with deep wells of hope, of resilience in the face of adversity,” Charles said. “Peace through forgiveness, simply getting to know our neighbors and by showing respect to one another, creating new friendships.”\n\n“In this, with the great diversity of our communities, we can find the strength to ensure that right triumphs over wrong,” he added.\n\nThe speech, which concluded with a Christmas carol sung by a Ukrainian choir, comes as European leaders rally support for Ukraine amid signs that U.S. President Donald Trump is losing patience with America’s traditional European allies. At home, British politics have become increasingly bitter as Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government struggles to control unauthorized migration and bolster creaking public services.\n\nCharles, the titular head of the Church of England, chose Westminster Abbey as the site of his Christmas Day broadcast to underscore the theme of pilgrimage that ran through the speech. The abbey, known as the site of coronations and royal weddings, is also the focus of an annual pilgrimage honoring Edward the Confessor, an early king of England who was canonized as a saint in 1161.\n\n“Pilgrimage is a word less used today, but it is of particular significance for our modern world, and especially at Christmas,’’ he said. “This is about journeying forward into the future, while also journeying back to remember the past and learn from its lessons.”\n\nCharles and his family made their own pilgrimage on foot earlier in the day to St. Mary Magdalene Church on the king’s private Sandringham Estate, about 100 miles north of London.\n\nCharles and Queen Camilla, along with Prince William and his wife, Kate, and their children, Princes George and Louis and Princess Charlotte, and extended family walked to the church and greeted the crowds of people after the service.\n\nEvents earlier this year marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II underscored the need to learn from the past, Charles said. While there are fewer and fewer living veterans of that conflict, we must remember the courage and sacrifice of those who fought the war and the way communities came together “in the face of such great challenge,” he said.\n\n“These are the values which have shaped our country and the Commonwealth,” he said. “As we hear of division, both at home and abroad, they are the values of which we must never lose sight.’’\n\nThe monarch’s annual holiday message is watched by millions of people in the U.K. and across the Commonwealth, a voluntary association of 56 independent nations, most of which have historic ties to Britain. The pre-recorded speech is broadcast at 3 p.m. London time, when many families are enjoying their traditional Christmas lunch.\n\nThe speech is one of the rare occasions when Charles, 77, is able to voice his own views and doesn’t seek guidance from the government.\n\nThis year’s address comes just two weeks after Charles made a deeply personal television appearance in which he said “good news” from his doctors meant that he would be able to reduce his treatment for cancer in the new year.\n\nThe king was diagnosed with a still undisclosed form of cancer in early 2024. Buckingham Palace says his treatment is now moving to a “precautionary phase” and his condition will be monitored to ensure his continued recovery.\n\nThe speech was accompanied by a video of members of the royal family, from the king to his grandchildren, George and Louis and Charlotte, meeting with the public and carrying out their royal duties.\n\nThat included scenes from the king’s historic trip to the Vatican as he works to forge closer relations between the Church of England and the Catholic Church.\n\nThe event was the first time since King Henry VIII severed ties with Rome that the leaders of the two Christian churches, divided for centuries over issues that now include the ordination of female priests in the Church of England, have prayed together.\n\nThe king’s message was clear. Even if some years had passed, there’s always hope to start over. Peace is possible.",

    "description": "A federal judge gave a green light Tuesday to New York’s so-called Green Light Law, rejecting the Trump administration’s bid to stop the state from giving people driver's licenses without having them prove they are in the country legally.  U.S. District Judge Anne M. Nardacci in Albany ruled that the Republican administration — which challenged the law under President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration — had failed to support its claims that the state law usurps federal law or that it unlawfully regulates or unlawfully discriminates against the federal government.",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge gave a green light Tuesday to New York’s so-called Green Light Law, rejecting the Trump administration’s bid to stop the state from giving people driver's licenses without having them prove they are in the country legally.\n\nU.S. District Judge Anne M. Nardacci in Albany ruled that the Republican administration — which challenged the law under President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration — had failed to support its claims that the state law usurps federal law or that it unlawfully regulates or unlawfully discriminates against the federal government.\n\nThe Justice Department sued the state over the law in February, naming Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state’s attorney general, Letitia James, as defendants. At a news conference announcing the lawsuit, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi accused the officials, both Democrats, of prioritizing “illegal aliens over American citizens.”\n\n“As I said from the start, our laws protect the rights of all New Yorkers and keep our communities safe,” James said in a statement Friday. “I will always stand up for New Yorkers and the rule of law.”\n\nA message seeking comment was left for the Justice Department.\n\nNardacci, appointed to the bench by President Joe Biden, a Democrat, wrote that her job was not to evaluate the desirability of the Green Light Law as a policy matter. Rather, she said in a 23-page opinion, it was to assess whether the Trump administration’s arguments established that the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, which gives federal laws precedence over state laws.\n\nThe administration, she wrote, has “failed to state such a claim.”\n\nThe Green Light Law was enacted partly to improve public safety on the roads, as people without licenses sometimes drove without one, or without having passed a road test. The state also makes it easier for holders of such licenses to get auto insurance, thus cutting down on crashes involving uninsured drivers.\n\nUnder the law, people who don’t have a valid Social Security number can submit alternative forms of ID that include valid passports and driver’s licenses issued in other countries. Applicants must still get a permit and pass a road test to qualify for a “standard driver’s license.” It does not apply to commercial driver’s licenses.\n\nThe Justice Department’s lawsuit sought to strike down the law as “a frontal assault on the federal immigration laws, and the federal authorities that administer them.” It highlighted a provision that requires the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles commissioner to inform people who are in the country illegally when a federal immigration agency has requested their information.\n\nIn 2020, during Trump’s first term, his administration sought to pressure New York into changing the law by barring anyone from the state from enrolling in trusted traveler programs, meaning they would spend longer amounts of time going through security lines at airports.\n\nThe governor at the time, Andrew Cuomo, offered to restore federal access to driving records on a limited basis, but said he wouldn’t let immigration agents see lists of people who had applied for the special licenses available to immigrants who couldn’t prove legal residency in the U.S. The administration ultimately restored New Yorkers’ access to the trusted traveler program after a brief legal fight.\n\nIn the lawsuit rejected Tuesday, the administration argued that it could be easier to enforce federal immigration priorities if federal authorities had unfettered access to New York’s driver information. Nardacci, echoing a 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in a county clerk’s earlier challenge to the law, wrote that such information “remains available to federal immigration authorities” through a lawful court order or judicial warrant.",

    "description": "Tahmina Watson's law firm assists with employment visas. She advises all visa holders with a valid stamp to return to the US immediately.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Tahmina Watson, a business immigration lawyer in Seattle. Business Insider has verified Watson's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm a business immigration lawyer, and in my day-to-day work with clients, I'm seeing immigration disruptions with immediate consequences, including H-1B visa holders who are outside the US being uncertain if they can return.\n\n​​My law firm, Watson Immigration Law, assists founders and businesses in navigating the employment visa application process. It appears that, at this time, the administration is coordinating the rescheduling and delay of immigration appointments.\n\nNon-immigrant visas generally must be scheduled at a US embassy or consulate in the person's country of nationality or residence. From my experience, many employees accrue their holiday time and schedule immigration appointments during this period because they're already planning to leave the country, allowing them to easily visit their designated US embassy or consulate.\n\nThese employees are now getting stuck, having already left the US, with their appointments getting rescheduled for June, July, or August 2026, and beyond.\n\nMajor tech companies, including Google, Apple, and Microsoft, sent memos out to their employees in the past week, warning visa-holding employees to avoid international travel amid long delays at US consulates. These policies are coming one after another, and they all intersect with each other.\n\nIf somebody is outside the country, what are employers supposed to do? Right now, my advice to clients outside the country is that if they have a valid visa stamp, they should return to the US as soon as possible.\n\nFor someone who has left the country to obtain a new visa stamp, I'm not sure there's a clear path to return. This includes individuals on F-1 student visas who traveled to visit family and were planning to re-enter the US. They will need that visa stamp from a consulate.\n\nEnsure your employment is still active and consider whether remote work is an option. If an employer decides they cannot keep someone on the books, even an appointment months from now will not help if there's no job waiting.\n\nIt's tough to know how things will unfold. What we're seeing is a confluence of policies coming in at the same time. For example, the Department of Homeland Security has just announced that it is replacing the lottery system for H-1B work visas, which randomly selects who receives a visa. The system is now set to prioritize higher-paid, higher-skilled workers.\n\nSocial media disclosure is being expanded from F-1 visa holders, which began during the student visa crisis, to now include H-1B workers. These applicants are required to change all social media privacy settings to public.\n\nIt could easily expand to other visa categories. The government has not provided clear guidance on what they are reviewing. By casting an overly broad net under the banner of national security, without clear standards or transparency, the administration is creating uncertainty that will ripple across families, employers, and the US economy.\n\nClients should limit what they post online.\n\nIn 2024, I was already anticipating these issues with traveling and returning to the US. We've also seen issues affecting green card holders with past criminal convictions.\n\nThere are many stories of people who have lived in the US for decades, suddenly facing deportation proceedings. This is a highly precarious time for immigrants, and limiting travel is critical.\n\nIt feels like a fire hose of policies. Everyone in the immigrant ecosystem is on high alert: Immigration lawyers, immigrants, employers, investors, founders, and employees.",

The money is part of a $1 billion program where allocations are supposed to be based on assessed risks, with states then largely passing most of the money on to police and fire departments.\n\nThe cuts were unveiled shortly after a separate federal judge in a different legal challenge ruled it was unconstitutional for the federal government to require states to cooperate on immigration enforcement actions to get FEMA disaster funding.\n\nIn her 48-page ruling, McElroy found that the federal government was weighing states' police on federal immigration enforcement on whether to reduce federal funding for the Homeland Security Grant Program and others.\n\n“What else could defendants’ decisions to cut funding to specific counterterrorism programming by conspicuous round numbered amounts — including by slashing off the millions-place digits of awarded sums — be if not arbitrary and capricious? Neither a law degree nor a degree in mathematics is required to deduce that no plausible, rational formula could produce this result,” McElroy wrote.\n\nThe Trump-appointed judge then ordered the Department of Homeland Security to restore the previously announced funding allocations to the plaintiff states.\n\n“Defendants’ wanton abuse of their role in federal grant administration is particularly troublesome given the fact that they have been entrusted with a most solemn duty: safeguarding our nation and its citizens,\" McElroy wrote. \"While the intricacies of administrative law and the terms and conditions on federal grants may seem abstract to some, the funding at issue here supports vital counterterrorism and law enforcement programs.”\n\nMcElroy notably cited the recent Brown University attack, where a gunman killed two students and injured nine others, as an event where the $1 billion federal program would be vital in responding to such a tragedy.\n\n“To hold hostage funding for programs like these based solely on what appear to be defendants’ political whims is unconscionable and, at least here, unlawful,” the Rhode Island-based judge wrote in her ruling, issued little more than a week after the Brown shooting.\n\nDHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the department plans on fighting the order.\n\n“This judicial sabotage threatens the safety of our states, counties, towns, and weakens the entire nation,\" McLaughlin said. \"We will fight to restore these critical reforms and protect American lives.”\n\nMeanwhile, attorneys general who sued the administration applauded the order.\n\n“This victory ensures that the Trump Administration cannot punish states that refuse to help carry out its cruel immigration agenda, particularly by denying them lifesaving funding that helps prepare for and respond to disasters and emergencies,” said Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell in a statement.",
