    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Hilton Worldwide Holdings has removed from its system a Minneapolis hotel that has refused to accept the bookings of Immigration and Customs Enforcement ​agents, the hotel operator said on Tuesday.\n\nA Hampton Inn hotel, a Hilton brand, outside Minneapolis, ‌Minnesota, refused to accommodate ICE agents, the Department of Homeland Security said in a post on social media platform X on Monday.\n\nThe ‌Trump administration has increased the number of officers in the area after allegations of fraud involving Somali immigrants.\n\n\"We are taking immediate action to remove this hotel from our systems. Hilton is - and has always been - a welcoming place for all,\" the company said on X.\n\nAmid mixed reactions online from consumers, with some calling for a ⁠boycott and others vowing to support Hilton, ‌the hotel operator is the latest U.S. company after Cracker Barrel to distance itself from moves that were criticized by the Trump administration and its base.\n\nHilton made ‍its comments after a video was posted on X on Tuesday which suggested ICE agents were still being refused rooms at the Hampton Inn in Lakeview, after Hilton and the independent operator of the hotel apologized for an initial incident.\n\n\"A ​recent video clearly raises concerns that they are not meeting our standards and values,\" Hilton said. In ‌a previous statement, Hilton said the property was independently owned and operated.\n\nDHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the department welcomed Tuesday's move by Hilton.\n\n\"Discriminatory business practices targeting DHS and deliberately undermining federal law enforcement are unAmerican and have real business consequences,” she said in a statement on X.\n\nEverpeak Hospitality, which runs the Hampton Inn, was not immediately available for comment on the video on Tuesday. It said on Monday it was ⁠in touch with the impacted guests to ensure they were ​accommodated.\n\n\"We do not discriminate against any individuals or agencies and ​apologize to those impacted,\" it said on its website.\n\nMcLaughlin said on X that the agency has not heard from Everpeak Hospitality.\n\nDHS had said on Monday that after ICE officers ‍booked rooms using official government ⁠emails and rates, a staff member at the Hampton Inn on January 2 canceled their reservations.\n\n\"We are not allowing any ICE or immigrant agents to stay at our property,\" read an email ⁠from the hotel posted on X by DHS.\n\nShares of the hotel operator rose 2.09% in afternoon trading, after being down 2.46% ‌at close on Monday.",

    "title": "Bill to Eliminate H-1B Visa Program Introduced in Congress",
    "description": "The bill introduced by Marjorie Taylor Greene would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to eliminate the H-1B visa program.",
    "fullText": "A bill that would \"eliminate the H-1B program,\" which helps U.S. companies hire highly skilled foreign workers, was among Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene's final two final pieces of proposed legislation, new records show.\n\nThe Republican of Georgia introduced the bill and another to mandate \"photo identification and proof of United States citizenship to vote in Federal elections\" on Friday.\n\nShe served her final day in Congress for Georgia's 14th district on Monday, following her a high-profile break with President Donald Trump over issues such as health care, the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files and foreign policy.\n\nThe H1-B visa program has been under heavy scrutiny during President Trump's second term.\n\nIn September, Trump ordered a controversial $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas, sparking ongoing legal challenges. In court papers, Trump's administration argued the substantial increase is necessary to protect American jobs and fund border security, while critics—including some business groups, educators and state governments—warned it would stifle innovation, competitiveness, and specialized fields like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and medicine.\n\nGreene's bill goes one step further than the government's position, seeking to end the program entirely.\n\nThe clash brings to the forefront the challenges Trump faces as he seeks to balance economic pragmatism with the “America First” sentiments of his political base, which Greene has argued are being ignored by Trump's administration.\n\nThe H-1B visa program allows employers to sponsor foreign professionals for jobs that require specialized skills, most commonly in technology, engineering, and science.\n\nEach year, the government issues 85,000 new H-1B visas, including 20,000 reserved for workers with advanced degrees from U.S. universities. Demand for the visas regularly exceeds supply, triggering an annual lottery. Indian nationals make up a large share of recipients.\n\nGreene first touted a H-1B program ban in September, writing on X: \"I am introducing a bill to END the mass replacement of American workers by aggressively phasing out the H1B program. Big Tech, AI giants, hospitals, and industries across the board have abused the H-1B system to cut out our own people. Americans are the most talented people in the world, and I have full faith in the American people. I serve Americans only, and I will ALWAYS put Americans first.\"\n\nRepresentative Beth Van Duyne, the Republican of Texas, last month also called for a total ban on the visas as part of a broader push to overhaul the U.S. immigration system, telling conservative commentator Benny Johnson politicians had overlooked the “unintended consequences” of programs like H-1B.\n\nMeanwhile, a federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration may proceed with imposing a $100,000 fee on new H1B visa applications. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which brought a legal challenge over concerns the fee would disrupt the framework established by Congress and impose high costs on U.S. businesses, last week launched an appeal over the ruling.\n\n\"These harms to American businesses will also be a boon to America’s economic rivals, who will surely welcome the talent no longer able to accept work in the United States,\" the business group said in its initial October lawsuit. \"That is a competitive edge that foreign employers might never cede back.\"\n\nSeparately, a coalition of 20 states, spearheaded by Washington Attorney General Nick Brown and California and Massachusetts' Attorneys General, challenged the fee’s legality under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), arguing the required notice-and-comment process was bypassed, and the fee was arbitrarily set unrelated to administrative costs.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State expanded its screening process for H-1B applicants and their dependents last month, requiring applicants to make social media accounts publicly accessible as part of routine vetting. Officials said the move was aimed at preventing abuse of the system.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has finalized new rules that will reshape the H-1B visa lottery. Beginning in 2027, applicants would no longer have equal chances of selection; instead, the system would prioritize higher-paid workers within each occupation. Federal officials said the change is intended to favor highly skilled applicants and respond to concerns about visa misuse and the displacement of U.S. workers.\n\nRepresentative Beth Van Duyne, the Republican of Texas, told conservative commentator Benny Johnson on December 17: “That H-1B visa program has got to either stop right now until we understand the amount of just how it’s being taken advantage of, or redone so it doesn't exist.\"\n\nStuart Anderson, executive director at the National Foundation for American Policy, responding to a decline in the number of H-1B visas approved for Indian-based companies, according to a National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) analysis of government data, told Newsweek: \"H-1B visas are important because they are typically the only way to hire a high-skilled foreign national long term in the United States, and approximately 70% of full-time graduate students in key science and technology fields at U.S. schools are international students.”\n\nUnited States Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesperson Matthew Tragesser, in a December 23 press release announcing H-1B lotttery changes: \"The new weighted selection will better serve Congress’ intent for the H-1B program and strengthen America’s competitiveness by incentivizing American employers to petition for higher-paid, higher-skilled foreign workers. With these regulatory changes and others in the future, we will continue to update the H-1B program to help American businesses without allowing the abuse that was harming American workers.”\n\nGreen's amendment has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee, along with the Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means committees.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s bold claims that his policies delivered an unprecedented jobs boom for American-born workers are at odds with data showing a weaker market than under his predecessor.\n\nTrump, 79, has repeatedly boasted that all new job gains have gone to U.S.-born workers since he returned to office. “In the year before my election, all net creation of jobs was going to foreign migrants. Since I took office, 100 percent of all net job creation has gone to American-born citizens,” Trump said during an address to the nation last month. “One hundred percent.”\n\nAdministration officials have parroted that rhetoric, saying on X in November that what Trump “is doing for our workforce is nothing short of HISTORIC.”\n\n“While other Presidents allowed foreign workers to flood the job market, President Trump is working to ensure ALL jobs created go to our workers,” the U.S. Department of Labor’s X account posted.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s right-hand man, Vice President JD Vance, has been aggressively backing his government’s handling of the economy.\n\nJust last month, against the backdrop of pessimistic unemployment data, Vance graded Trump’s economic performance “A plus-plus-plus-plus.”\n\nHe has also praised the administration for “bringing jobs back to America.”\n\n“We had a policy in this country for 40 years of shipping American jobs overseas... There is going to be a massive exception to that 40-year trajectory of American decline, and that’s the second Trump admin,” he said in discussion with Breitbart’s Matthew Boyle in Washington, D.C.\n\nEconomists, however, are calling Trump’s bluff. Citing data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, The Washington Post reported Friday that the labor market itself has weakened, leaving U.S.-born workers modestly worse off than they had been under former President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.\n\n“The unemployment rate has been rising for both native-born and foreign-born adults,” Jed Kolko, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former Commerce Department economist, told the Post.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, unemployment among native-born workers was higher in late 2025 than a year earlier. The not seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for U.S.-born workers rose from 3.9 percent in November 2024 to 4.3 percent in November 2025.\n\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute, Trump’s claims that his immigration policies are creating job market opportunities for U.S.-born workers are “false and based on a misreading of data from the household survey.”\n\n“If anything, the job market for U.S.-born workers is worse so far in 2025 than it was in preceding years,” senior economist Ben Zipperer wrote in September.\n\nIn August, Jed Kolko, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and undersecretary for economic affairs at the US Department of Commerce under Biden, accused the president of committing a “multiple-count data felony” in trumpeting a jobs boom for native-born Americans.\n\nTaylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement to the Post that “mindless nitpicking doesn’t change the simple fact that President Trump has done more for American workers than any president in history by cracking down on visa program abuses, successfully negotiating new trade deals, securing our border, and carrying out the largest mass deportation of illegal aliens.”\n\nRogers said those policies ensure “American-born workers can finally benefit from our new economic resurgence.”",

    "fullText": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — U.S. immigration officials do not plan to detain Kilmar Abrego Garcia again as long as a judge’s order banning it stands, according to a Tuesday court filing.\n\nThe plans by President Donald Trump’s administration are the latest in the saga over the Salvadoran citizen’s case that has become a lightning rod for both sides of the immigration debate as he fights to remain in the U.S. after a mistaken deportation to his home country, where he was imprisoned.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement did make clear they would detain Abrego Garcia if the order was lifted, Liana J. Castano, assistant director for field operations, wrote in the filing.\n\nTrump officials have accused Abrego Garcia of being a member of the MS-13 gang, but he has vehemently denied the accusations and has no criminal record. The administration brought him back to the U.S. in June under a court order, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paula Xinis earlier this month questioned whether government officials could be trusted to follow orders barring them from taking Abrego Garcia back into immigration custody or deporting him.\n\nA Justice Department push to indict\n\nEarlier Tuesday, a newly unsealed order in the criminal case against Abrego Garcia revealed that high-level Justice Department officials pushed for his indictment, calling it a “top priority,” only after he was mistakenly deported and then ordered returned to the U.S.\n\nAbrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty in federal court to the human smuggling charges. He is seeking to have the case dismissed on the grounds that the prosecution is vindictive, arguing the Trump administration is targeting him as punishment for the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation.\n\nTo support that argument, he has asked the government to turn over documents that reveal how the decision was made to prosecute him in 2025 for an incident that occurred in 2022.\n\nAbrego Garcia had recently been in immigration custody for three months before Xinis ordered his release on Dec. 11. In that time, the government said it planned to deport him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Liberia.\n\nIn her Dec. 11 order, Xinis found that immigration officials had no viable plan to remove Abrego Garcia from the U.S. and said he could not be held indefinitely. She issued a separate order barring ICE from re-detaining him, at least for the time being. After a hearing on the issue, Xinis ordered the government to file the brief they released Tuesday outlining whether they planned to detain Abrego Garcia again.\n\nAbrego Garcia's human smuggling case stems from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee where he was pulled over for speeding with nine passengers in the car. State troopers discussed the possibility of human smuggling among themselves. However, he was ultimately allowed to leave with only a warning. The case was turned over to Homeland Security Investigations, but there is no record of any effort to charge him until April 2025, according to court records.\n\nThe newly unsealed Dec. 3 order from U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw compelled the government to provide some documents to Abrego Garcia and his attorneys, although it does not give a lot of detail on their contents.\n\nClaims of a ‘vindictive’ prosecution\n\nEarlier, Crenshaw found that there was “some evidence” that the prosecution of Abrego Garcia could be vindictive. He specifically cited a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on a Fox News program that seemed to suggest that the Department of Justice charged Abrego Garcia because he had won his wrongful deportation case.\n\nRob McGuire, who was the Acting U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee until late December, argued that those statements were irrelevant because he alone made the decision to prosecute, and he has no animus against Abrego Garcia.\n\nIn the unsealed order, Crenshaw writes, “Some of the documents suggest not only that McGuire was not a solitary decision-maker, but he in fact reported to others in DOJ and the decision to prosecute Abrego may have been a joint decision.”\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee released a statement saying: “The emails cited in Judge Crenshaw’s order, specifically Mr. McGuire’s email on May 15, 2025, confirm that the ultimate decision on whether to prosecute was made by career prosecutors based on the facts, evidence, and established DOJ practice. Communications with the Deputy Attorney General’s Office about a high-profile case are both required and routine.”\n\nThe email referenced was from McGuire to his staff saying Blanche “would like Garcia charged sooner rather than later,” according to Crenshaw's order.\n\nThe order also shows that Aakash Singh, who works under Blanche in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, contacted McGuire about Abrego Garcia's case on April 27, the same day that McGuire received a file on the case from Homeland Security Investigations. That was several days after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Abrego Garcia's favor on April 10.\n\nOn April 30, Singh said in an email to McGuire that the prosecution was a “top priority” for the Deputy Attorney General's Office, according to the order. Singh and McGuire continued to communicate about the prosecution. On May 18, Singh wrote to McGuire and others to hold the draft indictment until they got “clearance” to file it. “The implication is that ‘clearance’ would come from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General,” Crenshaw writes.\n\nA hearing on the motion to dismiss the human smuggling case on the basis of vindictive prosecution is scheduled for Jan. 28.",

    "description": "H-1B visa policy shifts in 2025 cause firms to reconsider staffing, use alternative visas, and update HR travel guidance.",
    "fullText": "Since September, the H-1B visa program has been caught in a whirlwind of changes.\n\nAs a result, companies nationwide are scrambling to determine their next steps, rewriting travel guidance for foreign workers, and lining up backup staffing plans, including shifting some work overseas, according to five immigration attorneys who spoke with Business Insider.\n\n\"Unpredictability is one of the number one enemies for business,\" said Rohit Srinivasa, an immigration attorney based in Los Angeles who works with startups and medium-sized tech companies.\n\nFirst came a $100,000 fee on new applications in September. Then came social media vetting requirements that left visa holders stranded abroad during the holidays. Now, a wage-based lottery system will favor the highest-paid applicants by giving them more chances in the annual H-1B lottery.\n\nImmigration lawyers say the constant policy shifts have companies tightening sponsorship guidelines, re-budgeting for higher costs, and gaming out contingency plans for a program that keeps changing shape.\n\nCompanies are taking a more calculated approach to who they sponsor for work visas and how they do so, attorneys told Business Insider.\n\nDivij Kishore, an immigration attorney at New York-based Flagship Law, which represents clients across various sectors, including tech, healthcare, and energy, told Business Insider that he has seen a 40% to 50% drop in H-1B sponsorship inquiries compared to previous years.\n\nTypically, by this time of the year, clients reach out with lists of employees they'd like to sponsor for the spring lottery, Kishore said.\n\n\"This year, that's not been the case because employers are just not sure what the costs are,\" Kishore said.\n\nOn the other hand, K. Edward Raleigh, a partner at immigration firm Fragomen, which represents some of Silicon Valley's largest tech companies, including Apple and Nvidia, told Business Insider that he hasn't seen a material slowdown in H-1B filings overall, as most are renewals for existing workers.\n\nStill, companies are \"tightening up their sponsorship guidelines\" and \"proceeding with caution, understanding that various things could trigger the fee,\" he said.\n\nThis recalculation is occurring despite the $100,000 fee having a narrow scope. It applies to new visa petitions for workers living abroad and does not apply to the vast majority of cases, such as foreign students already in the US switching from an academic visa to a work visa or existing H-1B holders changing employers.\n\n\"One of the main attributes of this administration is that they keep people guessing,\" said Ted Chiappari, who leads the immigration practice at law firm Duane Morris. \"Just because things are one way on Monday doesn't mean they're going to be the same way on Tuesday, and they won't switch back to things on Wednesday.\"\n\nFewer H-1B visas have been issued to Indian IT consulting firms, according to data from the National Foundation for American Policy, an Arlington-based nonprofit research organization focused on immigration and international trade.\n\nInstead, for the first time in the program's history, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google occupied the top four spots for H-1B approvals in fiscal year 2025, a shift that began before the recent policy upheaval. The trend suggests companies were already reassessing tech hiring strategies before the recent policy changes.\n\nDespite the turmoil, Srinivasa believes the H-1B will endure, saying the program is \"so baked in\" to the US economy, he said, that it's undergoing overhaul rather than replacement.\n\nSome sectors saw more impact than others. Universities and nonprofit healthcare organizations that have historically recruited professors and medical workers from abroad have largely stopped filing petitions subject to the fee, Chiappari said. Unlike for-profit companies, these institutions can hire H-1B workers throughout the year without going through the annual lottery.\n\n\"That pipeline is now dried up,\" Chiappari said.\n\nRather than abandoning H-1B sponsorship, companies are exploring alternative pathways and backup strategies.\n\nSrinivasa said interest in O-1 visas for workers with \"extraordinary ability\" has surged, though not everyone qualifies. To qualify, applicants typically need to demonstrate a track record of impact and achievements in their field as evidenced by patents, awards, membership in select associations, and media coverage about them.\n\nSome founders from countries with US trade treaties are turning to E-2 investor visas, which also provide work authorization for spouses. Others are using the EB-1C path, where companies send managers abroad for a year before bringing them back to the US.\n\nCompanies are also increasingly establishing international offices and using L-1 visas to transfer employees to the US, or opting for services like Deel and Rippling that serve as the official employer, handling immigration paperwork on behalf of client companies.\n\nBig Tech, as well as Wall Street firms such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, have been expanding their operations in Indian cities like Bengaluru and Hyderabad.\n\nKishore said some clients are preemptively reaching out to offshore providers to ramp up staffing capacity in case they are unable to bring workers to the US as planned.\n\n\"If they can't spend that same hundred dollars within the US next year, they will spend a hundred dollars outside the US,\" he added.\n\nStarting with the 2026 lottery, visa applications will be weighted based on salary level. Workers offered the highest wages will get four entries in the lottery, while those at the lowest tier get just one. The administration says this will ensure visas are awarded to the most skilled workers.\n\nRaleigh said companies are already thinking about how this will affect their recruitment strategy, \"without the exact terms of how those rules are going to work.\"\n\nThe change will likely benefit large tech companies that can afford to place workers in top salary bands, while creating challenges for smaller companies, nonprofits, and early-stage startups.\n\n\"Often the best startup founders forgo being paid a living wage because they're so dedicated to the mission,\" said Sophie Alcorn, a Bay Area immigration attorney who focuses on startups and entrepreneurs. \"Those same startups may be the ones that have the most difficulty in getting the right people through this future system.\"\n\nKishore said that a higher salary doesn't always mean more skill. A first-year associate at a major law firm might make $225,000, while an equally qualified associate at a smaller firm makes significantly less. Under the new system, the big-firm lawyer would have much better lottery chances, he said.\n\nSome attorneys are advising clients not to artificially inflate salaries to game the system. Chiappari said the spread between wage levels is typically $20,000 to $30,000 — far less than the $100,000 fee — and companies aren't rushing to increase compensation anyway.\n\nImmigration attorneys previously thought that the $100,000 fee might improve the chances for foreign students already studying in the US by increasing their chances if fewer companies enter candidates in the lottery. Now, the wage-based lottery means that it might not happen.\n\n\"That logic's been turned on its head,\" said Kishore, adding that students, who typically enter the workforce at lower salaries, will get fewer chances at the lottery.\n\nBeyond policy changes, companies are also recalibrating their compliance strategies to avoid triggering fees or violating new rules.\n\nRaleigh said that ensuring workers maintain valid immigration status has become even more critical, as any lapse could force someone to leave the country and return on a new H-1B visa, potentially triggering the $10,000 fee.\n\nCompanies are updating their HR policies, including guidance on social media presence for foreign hires, in response to new vetting requirements, Srinivasa said. Some are advising employees to avoid international travel altogether, even when technically permitted.\n\nChiappari said he still gets constant questions from worried H-1B holders about whether it's safe to travel internationally.\n\n\"Even if I write a three-page affidavit explaining how they're not going to have any trouble coming back to the United States, they're just not going to believe it, and they're staying here,\" Chiappari said. \"They're just not traveling.\"\n\nThe human cost is real: postponed weddings, skipped vacations, and delayed work travel.\n\n\"Employers,\" Kishore said, \"need to be prepared and agile for what's coming in the next few months.\"",

    "fullText": "CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Men who were part of the group of Venezuelan migrants that the United States government transferred earlier this year to a prison in El Salvador demanded justice on Friday, days after a federal judge in Washington ruled that the Trump administration must give them legal due process.\n\nThe men told reporters in Venezuela’s capital that they hope legal organizations can push their claims in court. Their press conference was organized by Venezuela’s government, which had previously said it had retained legal services for the immigrants.\n\nOn Monday, a federal judge ordered the U.S. government to give legal due process to the 252 Venezuelan men, either by providing court hearings or returning them to the U.S. The ruling opens a path for the men to challenge the Trump administration’s allegation that they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang and subject to removal under an 18th century wartime law.\n\nThe men have repeatedly said they were physically and psychologically tortured while at the notorious Salvadoran prison.\n\n“Today, we are here to demand justice before the world for the human rights violations committed against each of us, and to ask for help from international organizations to assist us in our defense so that our human rights are respected and not violated again,” Andry Blanco told reporters in Caracas, where roughly two dozen of the migrants gathered Friday.\n\nSome of the men shared the daily struggles they now face — including fear of leaving their home or encountering law enforcement — as a consequence of what they said were brutal abuses while in prison. The men did not specify what justice should look like in their case, but not all are interested in returning to the U.S.\n\n“I don’t trust them,” Nolberto Aguilar said of the U.S. government.\n\nThe men were flown to El Salvador in March. They were sent to their home country in July as part of a prisoner swap between the Trump administration and the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nCamilla Fabri, Venezuelan vice minister of foreign affairs for international communications, said Maduro's government is working with a bar association in the U.S. and “all human rights organizations to prepare a major lawsuit against Trump and the United States government, so that they truly acknowledge all the crimes they have committed against” the men.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge this week canceled the trial of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported, and scheduled a hearing on whether the prosecution is being vindictive in pursuing a human smuggling case against him.\n\nAbrego Garcia has become a centerpiece of the debate over immigration after the Trump administration deported him in March to a notorious prison in El Salvador. Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee.\n\nAbrego Garcia has denied the allegations, and argued that prosecutors are vindictively and selectively targeting him. Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr. wrote in Tuesday’s order that Abrego Garcia had enough evidence to hold a hearing on the topic, which Crenshaw scheduled for Jan. 28.\n\nAt that hearing, prosecutors will have to explain their reasoning for charging Abrego Garcia, Crenshaw wrote, and if they fail in that, the charges could be dismissed.\n\nWhen Abrego Garcia was pulled over in 2022, there were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security agent previously testified that he did not begin investigating the traffic stop until after the U.S. Supreme Court said in April that the Trump administration had to work to bring Abrego Garcia from El Salvador, where he was deported.\n\nYears earlier, Abrego Garcia had been granted protection from deportation to his home country after a judge found he faced danger there from a gang that targeted his family. That order allowed Abrego Garcia, who has an American wife and child, to live and work in the U.S. under Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervision.\n\nMembers of President Donald Trump’s administration have accused Abrego Garcia of being a member of the MS-13 gang, but he has vehemently denied the accusations and has no criminal record.\n\nAbrego Garcia's defense attorney and the U.S. attorney's office in Nashville did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "LONDON (AP) — On a Christmas Day when the war in Ukraine casts a shadow over Europe, concerns over immigration divide societies, and some politicians fan anger and resentment, Britain’s King Charles III called on people to focus on kindness instead of conflict.\n\nDelivering his annual holiday address from Westminster Abbey, Charles said Thursday the Christmas story of wise men and shepherds traveling through the night to find their savior shows how we can find strength in the “companionship and kindness of others.”\n\n“To this day, in times of uncertainty, these ways of living are treasured by all the great faiths and provide us with deep wells of hope, of resilience in the face of adversity,” Charles said. “Peace through forgiveness, simply getting to know our neighbors and by showing respect to one another, creating new friendships.”\n\n“In this, with the great diversity of our communities, we can find the strength to ensure that right triumphs over wrong,” he added.\n\nThe speech, which concluded with a Christmas carol sung by a Ukrainian choir, comes as European leaders rally support for Ukraine amid signs that U.S. President Donald Trump is losing patience with America’s traditional European allies. At home, British politics have become increasingly bitter as Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government struggles to control unauthorized migration and bolster creaking public services.\n\nCharles, the titular head of the Church of England, chose Westminster Abbey as the site of his Christmas Day broadcast to underscore the theme of pilgrimage that ran through the speech. The abbey, known as the site of coronations and royal weddings, is also the focus of an annual pilgrimage honoring Edward the Confessor, an early king of England who was canonized as a saint in 1161.\n\n“Pilgrimage is a word less used today, but it is of particular significance for our modern world, and especially at Christmas,’’ he said. “This is about journeying forward into the future, while also journeying back to remember the past and learn from its lessons.”\n\nCharles and his family made their own pilgrimage on foot earlier in the day to St. Mary Magdalene Church on the king’s private Sandringham Estate, about 100 miles north of London.\n\nCharles and Queen Camilla, along with Prince William and his wife, Kate, and their children, Princes George and Louis and Princess Charlotte, and extended family walked to the church and greeted the crowds of people after the service.\n\nEvents earlier this year marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II underscored the need to learn from the past, Charles said. While there are fewer and fewer living veterans of that conflict, we must remember the courage and sacrifice of those who fought the war and the way communities came together “in the face of such great challenge,” he said.\n\n“These are the values which have shaped our country and the Commonwealth,” he said. “As we hear of division, both at home and abroad, they are the values of which we must never lose sight.’’\n\nThe monarch’s annual holiday message is watched by millions of people in the U.K. and across the Commonwealth, a voluntary association of 56 independent nations, most of which have historic ties to Britain. The pre-recorded speech is broadcast at 3 p.m. London time, when many families are enjoying their traditional Christmas lunch.\n\nThe speech is one of the rare occasions when Charles, 77, is able to voice his own views and doesn’t seek guidance from the government.\n\nThis year’s address comes just two weeks after Charles made a deeply personal television appearance in which he said “good news” from his doctors meant that he would be able to reduce his treatment for cancer in the new year.\n\nThe king was diagnosed with a still undisclosed form of cancer in early 2024. Buckingham Palace says his treatment is now moving to a “precautionary phase” and his condition will be monitored to ensure his continued recovery.\n\nThe speech was accompanied by a video of members of the royal family, from the king to his grandchildren, George and Louis and Charlotte, meeting with the public and carrying out their royal duties.\n\nThat included scenes from the king’s historic trip to the Vatican as he works to forge closer relations between the Church of England and the Catholic Church.\n\nThe event was the first time since King Henry VIII severed ties with Rome that the leaders of the two Christian churches, divided for centuries over issues that now include the ordination of female priests in the Church of England, have prayed together.\n\nThe king’s message was clear. Even if some years had passed, there’s always hope to start over. Peace is possible.",

    "description": "A federal judge gave a green light Tuesday to New York’s so-called Green Light Law, rejecting the Trump administration’s bid to stop the state from giving people driver's licenses without having them prove they are in the country legally.  U.S. District Judge Anne M. Nardacci in Albany ruled that the Republican administration — which challenged the law under President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration — had failed to support its claims that the state law usurps federal law or that it unlawfully regulates or unlawfully discriminates against the federal government.",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge gave a green light Tuesday to New York’s so-called Green Light Law, rejecting the Trump administration’s bid to stop the state from giving people driver's licenses without having them prove they are in the country legally.\n\nU.S. District Judge Anne M. Nardacci in Albany ruled that the Republican administration — which challenged the law under President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration — had failed to support its claims that the state law usurps federal law or that it unlawfully regulates or unlawfully discriminates against the federal government.\n\nThe Justice Department sued the state over the law in February, naming Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state’s attorney general, Letitia James, as defendants. At a news conference announcing the lawsuit, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi accused the officials, both Democrats, of prioritizing “illegal aliens over American citizens.”\n\n“As I said from the start, our laws protect the rights of all New Yorkers and keep our communities safe,” James said in a statement Friday. “I will always stand up for New Yorkers and the rule of law.”\n\nA message seeking comment was left for the Justice Department.\n\nNardacci, appointed to the bench by President Joe Biden, a Democrat, wrote that her job was not to evaluate the desirability of the Green Light Law as a policy matter. Rather, she said in a 23-page opinion, it was to assess whether the Trump administration’s arguments established that the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, which gives federal laws precedence over state laws.\n\nThe administration, she wrote, has “failed to state such a claim.”\n\nThe Green Light Law was enacted partly to improve public safety on the roads, as people without licenses sometimes drove without one, or without having passed a road test. The state also makes it easier for holders of such licenses to get auto insurance, thus cutting down on crashes involving uninsured drivers.\n\nUnder the law, people who don’t have a valid Social Security number can submit alternative forms of ID that include valid passports and driver’s licenses issued in other countries. Applicants must still get a permit and pass a road test to qualify for a “standard driver’s license.” It does not apply to commercial driver’s licenses.\n\nThe Justice Department’s lawsuit sought to strike down the law as “a frontal assault on the federal immigration laws, and the federal authorities that administer them.” It highlighted a provision that requires the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles commissioner to inform people who are in the country illegally when a federal immigration agency has requested their information.\n\nIn 2020, during Trump’s first term, his administration sought to pressure New York into changing the law by barring anyone from the state from enrolling in trusted traveler programs, meaning they would spend longer amounts of time going through security lines at airports.\n\nThe governor at the time, Andrew Cuomo, offered to restore federal access to driving records on a limited basis, but said he wouldn’t let immigration agents see lists of people who had applied for the special licenses available to immigrants who couldn’t prove legal residency in the U.S. The administration ultimately restored New Yorkers’ access to the trusted traveler program after a brief legal fight.\n\nIn the lawsuit rejected Tuesday, the administration argued that it could be easier to enforce federal immigration priorities if federal authorities had unfettered access to New York’s driver information. Nardacci, echoing a 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in a county clerk’s earlier challenge to the law, wrote that such information “remains available to federal immigration authorities” through a lawful court order or judicial warrant.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Tahmina Watson, a business immigration lawyer in Seattle. Business Insider has verified Watson's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm a business immigration lawyer, and in my day-to-day work with clients, I'm seeing immigration disruptions with immediate consequences, including H-1B visa holders who are outside the US being uncertain if they can return.\n\n​​My law firm, Watson Immigration Law, assists founders and businesses in navigating the employment visa application process. It appears that, at this time, the administration is coordinating the rescheduling and delay of immigration appointments.\n\nNon-immigrant visas generally must be scheduled at a US embassy or consulate in the person's country of nationality or residence. From my experience, many employees accrue their holiday time and schedule immigration appointments during this period because they're already planning to leave the country, allowing them to easily visit their designated US embassy or consulate.\n\nThese employees are now getting stuck, having already left the US, with their appointments getting rescheduled for June, July, or August 2026, and beyond.\n\nMajor tech companies, including Google, Apple, and Microsoft, sent memos out to their employees in the past week, warning visa-holding employees to avoid international travel amid long delays at US consulates. These policies are coming one after another, and they all intersect with each other.\n\nIf somebody is outside the country, what are employers supposed to do? Right now, my advice to clients outside the country is that if they have a valid visa stamp, they should return to the US as soon as possible.\n\nFor someone who has left the country to obtain a new visa stamp, I'm not sure there's a clear path to return. This includes individuals on F-1 student visas who traveled to visit family and were planning to re-enter the US. They will need that visa stamp from a consulate.\n\nEnsure your employment is still active and consider whether remote work is an option. If an employer decides they cannot keep someone on the books, even an appointment months from now will not help if there's no job waiting.\n\nIt's tough to know how things will unfold. What we're seeing is a confluence of policies coming in at the same time. For example, the Department of Homeland Security has just announced that it is replacing the lottery system for H-1B work visas, which randomly selects who receives a visa. The system is now set to prioritize higher-paid, higher-skilled workers.\n\nSocial media disclosure is being expanded from F-1 visa holders, which began during the student visa crisis, to now include H-1B workers. These applicants are required to change all social media privacy settings to public.\n\nIt could easily expand to other visa categories. The government has not provided clear guidance on what they are reviewing. By casting an overly broad net under the banner of national security, without clear standards or transparency, the administration is creating uncertainty that will ripple across families, employers, and the US economy.\n\nClients should limit what they post online.\n\nIn 2024, I was already anticipating these issues with traveling and returning to the US. We've also seen issues affecting green card holders with past criminal convictions.\n\nThere are many stories of people who have lived in the US for decades, suddenly facing deportation proceedings. This is a highly precarious time for immigrants, and limiting travel is critical.\n\nIt feels like a fire hose of policies. Everyone in the immigrant ecosystem is on high alert: Immigration lawyers, immigrants, employers, investors, founders, and employees.",

    "fullText": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to reallocate federal Homeland Security funding away from states that refuse to cooperate with certain federal immigration enforcement.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mary McElroy's ruling on Monday solidified a win for the coalition of 12 attorneys general that sued the administration earlier this year after being alerted that their states would receive drastically reduced federal grants due to their “sanctuary” jurisdictions.\n\nIn total, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency reduced more than $233 million from Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. The money is part of a $1 billion program where allocations are supposed to be based on assessed risks, with states then largely passing most of the money on to police and fire departments.\n\nThe cuts were unveiled shortly after a separate federal judge in a different legal challenge ruled it was unconstitutional for the federal government to require states to cooperate on immigration enforcement actions to get FEMA disaster funding.\n\nIn her 48-page ruling, McElroy found that the federal government was weighing states' police on federal immigration enforcement on whether to reduce federal funding for the Homeland Security Grant Program and others.\n\n“What else could defendants’ decisions to cut funding to specific counterterrorism programming by conspicuous round numbered amounts — including by slashing off the millions-place digits of awarded sums — be if not arbitrary and capricious? Neither a law degree nor a degree in mathematics is required to deduce that no plausible, rational formula could produce this result,” McElroy wrote.\n\nThe Trump-appointed judge then ordered the Department of Homeland Security to restore the previously announced funding allocations to the plaintiff states.\n\n“Defendants’ wanton abuse of their role in federal grant administration is particularly troublesome given the fact that they have been entrusted with a most solemn duty: safeguarding our nation and its citizens,\" McElroy wrote. \"While the intricacies of administrative law and the terms and conditions on federal grants may seem abstract to some, the funding at issue here supports vital counterterrorism and law enforcement programs.”\n\nMcElroy notably cited the recent Brown University attack, where a gunman killed two students and injured nine others, as an event where the $1 billion federal program would be vital in responding to such a tragedy.\n\n“To hold hostage funding for programs like these based solely on what appear to be defendants’ political whims is unconscionable and, at least here, unlawful,” the Rhode Island-based judge wrote in her ruling, issued little more than a week after the Brown shooting.\n\nDHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the department plans on fighting the order.\n\n“This judicial sabotage threatens the safety of our states, counties, towns, and weakens the entire nation,\" McLaughlin said. \"We will fight to restore these critical reforms and protect American lives.”\n\nMeanwhile, attorneys general who sued the administration applauded the order.\n\n“This victory ensures that the Trump Administration cannot punish states that refuse to help carry out its cruel immigration agenda, particularly by denying them lifesaving funding that helps prepare for and respond to disasters and emergencies,” said Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell in a statement.",

    "description": "Two models for tech wealth are emerging, as notable billionaire donors reveal their priorities.",
    "fullText": "Mark Zuckerberg’s decision to cut off funding to the pro‑immigration group FWD.us marks a sharp turn away from the high-profile social advocacy that once defined his philanthropy, even as MacKenzie Scott is emerging as the era’s most aggressive backer of equity- and DEI-driven causes.\n\nThe split shows a broader divergence in tech philanthropy: one billionaire channeling resources into science and AI infrastructure, the other pouring unrestricted billions into institutions serving communities historically excluded from power and wealth.\n\nFor more than a decade, FWD.us was a marquee example of Zuckerberg’s attempt to fuse Silicon Valley muscle with Washington policy, pushing immigration and criminal justice reform from the political center.\n\nBut in 2025, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) quietly stopped funding FWD.us—its first year without support from Zuckerberg; his wife, Priscilla Chan; or their philanthropy—formally ending a relationship that began with a 2013 launch op‑ed and hundreds of millions of dollars in backing, Business Insider reports.\n\nThe wind‑down was years in the making: By late 2022, CZI had already begun pivoting away from social advocacy, providing “foundational” funding meant to give FWD.us runway before the partnership ended, and in April 2025, the break was formalized. The timing now reads less like a slow fade than a strategic alignment with Zuckerberg’s rightward political recalibration in the Trump era, as Meta relaxed content rules criticized by conservatives, while the company and its CEO leaned into the new administration.\n\nCZI’s new pitch sounds less like a traditional foundation and more like a research lab: Its leadership talks about GPUs, not gala dinners. In November, Zuckerberg and Chan announced that CZI would concentrate on science and AI, doubling down on the Biohub network of biology labs it has funded since 2016 and recruiting researchers with the promise of massive compute power rather than more office space.\n\nWhere early CZI grants were scattered across immigration, criminal justice, and education policy, the current strategy funnels capital into building infrastructure—data, tools, and models—that scientists can use for decades. The bet is that by underwriting AI‑enabled biomedical discovery and related fields, CZI can claim long‑horizon, system‑level impact without the political volatility that accompanies hot‑button social debates like border policy or policing.\n\nMacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is moving in the opposite direction, embracing the very equity agendas many corporations and campuses are backing away from under political pressure. In 2025 alone, she announced roughly $7.1 billion in donations—bringing her total giving since 2019 to more than $26 billion—with a heavy tilt toward historically Black colleges and universities, tribal colleges, Native scholarship providers, and organizations serving low‑income and underrepresented students.",

    "description": "U. President Donald Trump is preparing for a more aggressive immigration crackdown in 2026 with billions in new funding, including by raiding more workplaces — even as backlash builds ahead of next year’s midterm elections.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 21 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is preparing for a more aggressive immigration crackdown in 2026 with billions in new funding, including by raiding more workplaces — even as backlash builds ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n\nTrump has already surged immigration agents into major U.S. cities, where they swept through neighborhoods and clashed with residents. While ​federal agents this year conducted some high-profile raids on businesses, they largely avoided raiding farms, factories and other businesses that are economically important but known to employ immigrants without legal status.\n\nICE and Border Patrol ‌will get $170 billion in additional funds through September 2029 - a huge surge of funding over their existing annual budgets of about $19 billion after the Republican-controlled Congress passed a massive spending package in July.\n\nAdministration officials say they plan to hire thousands more agents, open new detention centers, pick up ‌more immigrants in local jails and partner with outside companies to track down people without legal status.\n\nThe expanded deportation plans come despite growing signs of political backlash ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n\nMiami, one of the cities most affected by Trump’s crackdown because of its large immigrant population, elected its first Democratic mayor in nearly three decades last week in what the mayor-elect said was, in part, a reaction to the president. Other local elections and polling have suggested rising concern among voters wary of aggressive immigration tactics.\n\n\"People are beginning to see this not as an immigration question anymore as much as it is a violation of rights, a violation of due process and militarizing neighborhoods extraconstitutionally,\" said Mike Madrid, a moderate Republican ⁠political strategist. \"There is no question that is a problem for the president and Republicans.\"\n\nTrump’s ‌overall approval rating on immigration policy fell from 50% in March, before he launched crackdowns in several major U.S. cities, to 41% in mid-December, for what had been his strongest issue.\n\nRising public unease has focused on masked federal agents using aggressive tactics such as deploying tear gas in residential neighborhoods and detaining U.S. citizens.\n\nIn addition to expanding enforcement ‍actions, Trump has stripped hundreds of thousands of Haitian, Venezuelan and Afghan immigrants of temporary legal status, expanding the pool of people who could be deported as the president promises to remove 1 million immigrants each year – a goal he almost certainly will miss this year. So far, some 622,000 immigrants have been deported since Trump took office in January.\n\nWhite House border czar Tom Homan told Reuters Trump had delivered on his promise of a historic deportation operation and removing criminals while shutting down illegal immigration across ​the U.S.-Mexico border. Homan said the number of arrests will increase sharply as ICE hires more officers and expands detention capacity with the new funding.\n\n“I think you're going to see the numbers explode greatly next year,” Homan said.\n\nHoman ‌said the plans “absolutely” include more enforcement actions at workplaces.\n\nSarah Pierce, director of social policy at the center-left group Third Way, said U.S. businesses have been reluctant to push back on Trump's immigration crackdown in the past year but could be prompted to speak up if the focus turns to employers.\n\nPierce said it will be interesting to see \"whether or not businesses finally stand up to this administration.\"\n\nTrump, a Republican, recaptured the White House promising record levels of deportations, saying it was needed after years of high levels of illegal immigration under his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden. He kicked off a campaign that dispatched federal agents to U.S. cities in search of possible immigration offenders, sparking protests and lawsuits over racial profiling and violent tactics.\n\nSome businesses shut down to avoid raids or because of a lack of customers. Parents vulnerable to arrest kept their children home from school or had neighbors walk them. Some U.S. citizens started carrying passports.\n\nDespite ⁠the focus on criminals in its public statements, government data shows that the Trump administration has been arresting more people who have ​not been charged with any crimes beyond their alleged immigration violations than previous administrations.\n\nSome 41% of the roughly 54,000 people arrested by ICE ​and detained by late November had no criminal record beyond a suspected immigration violation, agency figures show. In the first few weeks in January, before Trump took office, just 6% of those arrested and detained by ICE were not facing charges for other crimes or previously convicted.\n\nThe Trump administration has taken aim at legal immigrants as well. Agents have arrested spouses of ‍U.S. citizens at their green card interviews, pulled people from ⁠certain countries out of their naturalization ceremonies, moments before they were to become citizens, and revoked thousands of student visas.\n\nThe administration’s planned focus on job sites in the coming year could generate many more arrests and affect the U.S. economy and Republican-leaning business owners.\n\nReplacing immigrants arrested during workplace raids could lead to higher labor costs, undermining Trump’s fight against inflation, which analysts expect to be a major issue ⁠in the closely watched November elections, determining control of Congress.\n\nAdministration officials earlier this year exempted such businesses from enforcement on Trump’s orders, then quickly reversed, Reuters reported at the time.\n\nSome immigration hardliners have called for more workplace enforcement.\n\n\"Eventually you’re going to have to go after these ‌employers,” said Jessica Vaughan, policy director for the Center for Immigration Studies, which backs lower levels of immigration. “When that starts happening the employers will start cleaning up their acts on their own.”",

    "fullText": "GREENBELT, Md. (AP) — A federal judge on Monday will hear arguments about whether Kilmar Abrego Garcia should be returned to immigration custody after being free for just over a week.\n\nAbrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation to El Salvador has become a lightning rod for both sides of the immigration debate, had been in immigration detention since August. In that time, the government has said it planned to deport him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Liberia. However, officials have made no effort to deport him to the one country he has agreed to go to — Costa Rica. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, in Maryland, has even accused the government of misleading her by falsely claiming that Costa Rica was unwilling to take him.\n\nThe government's “persistent refusal to acknowledge Costa Rica as a viable removal option, their threats to send Abrego Garcia to African countries that never agreed to take him, and their misrepresentation to the Court that Liberia is now the only country available to Abrego Garcia, all reflect that whatever purpose was behind his detention, it was not for the ‘basic purpose’ of timely third-country removal,” she wrote.\n\nXinis’ Dec. 11 order that Abrego Garcia be released from immigration custody also concluded that the immigration judge who heard his case in 2019 had failed to issue an order of removal from the U.S., and he cannot be deported anywhere without a removal order.\n\nAbrego Garcia has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the U.S. illegally from El Salvador as a teenager. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country, finding he faced danger there from a gang that had targeted his family. In March, he was mistakenly deported there anyway. U.S. officials resisted calls to bring him back until the Supreme Court weighed in. However, officials have said he cannot stay in the U.S. and have vowed to deport him to a third country.\n\nIn filings last week, government attorneys argued that, with or without a final order of removal, they are still working to deport Abrego Garcia, so they can legally detain him during the process.\n\n“If there is no final order of removal, immigration proceedings are ongoing, and Petitioner is subject to pre-final order detention,” they wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, Abrego Garcia's attorneys cited a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that “because immigration proceedings ‘are civil, not criminal’ detention must be ‘nonpunitive.’” They argued that in Abrego Garcia's case, detention is punitive because the government wants to be allowed to hold him indefinitely without a viable plan to deport him.\n\n“If immigration detention does not serve the legitimate purpose of effectuating reasonably foreseeable removal, it is punitive, potentially indefinite, and unconstitutional,” they wrote.",

The justices let stand a ruling that raised questions about the Trump administration's handling of the federal workforce, though they also signaled that lower courts should move cautiously.\n\nImmigration judges are federal employees, and the question at the center of the appeal is about whether they can sue to challenge a policy restricting their public speeches or if they are required to use a separate complaint system for the federal workforce.\n\nTrump's Republican administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene after an appeals court found that Trump’s firings of top complaint system officials had raised questions about whether it's still working as intended.\n\nThe Justice Department said the firings are within the president’s power and the lower court had no grounds to raise questions. The solicitor general asked the Supreme Court to quickly freeze the ruling as he pushes to have the immigration judges’ case removed from federal court.\n\nThe justices declined, though they also said the Trump administration could return if the lower courts moved too fast. There were no noted dissents. The court has allowed most of Trump’s firings for now and is weighing whether to formally expand his legal power to fire independent agency officials by overturning job protections enshrined in a 90-year-old decision.\n\nA union formerly representing immigration judges, who work for the Justice Department, first sued in 2020 to challenge a policy restricting what the judges can speak about in public. They say the case is a free-speech issue that belongs in federal court.\n\nRamya Krishnan, an attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute who argued the case on the union's behalf, applauded the high court's Friday decision. “The restrictions on immigration judges’ free speech rights are unconstitutional, and it’s intolerable that this prior restraint is still in place,” Krishnan said.\n\nIn recent months, the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has included firing dozens of immigration judges who are seen by his allies as too lenient.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to an email message seeking comment Friday.\n\nWhile the order is not a final decision, the case could eventually have implications for other federal workers who want to challenge firings in court rather than the employee complaint system now largely overseen by Trump appointees.\n\nThe decision comes after a series of wins for the Justice Department on the high court’s emergency docket. The court has sided with the Trump administration about two dozen times on issues ranging from immigration to federal funding.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court.",

    "description": "Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan's philanthropy organization did not fund FWD.us in 2025. Zuckerberg cofounded the immigration reform group in 2013.",
    "fullText": "The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is no longer funding a pro-immigration group that Mark Zuckerberg cofounded over a decade ago.\n\nIt's the latest change for the organization amid the Meta CEO's public rightward shift since President Donald Trump was reelected.\n\nCZI, the philanthropic organization founded by Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, did not provide funding for the pro-immigration and criminal justice reform group FWD.us in 2025, according to two people familiar with the matter. It was the first year CZI did not fund FWD.us.\n\nThe shift had been in motion for years, beginning in late 2022, when CZI started pivoting its focus more squarely toward scientific research, the two people said. Discussions at the time indicated that the organization's financial relationship with FWD.us would eventually conclude, and the separation was formalized in April 2025, the people said. Bloomberg first reported the funding cut.\n\n\"Nearly five years ago, we shared that we were focusing on our core work in science, education, and supporting our local communities,\" a CZI representative told Business Insider in a statement. \"As part of that transition, we committed foundational funding to FWD.us to continue their bipartisan work. We have fulfilled that financial commitment and wound down our social advocacy funding.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Jordan Fox, CZI's chief of staff, also stepped down from FWD.us's board of directors, leaving a vacancy that will not be filled by another CZI representative, the two people added.\n\n\"Our focus remains on advancing pragmatic, bipartisan solutions that strengthen the economy and make the immigration and criminal justice systems work better,\" said Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us. \"That mission hasn't changed.\"\n\nZuckerberg was key to building FWD.us. He cofounded the organization in 2013, launching it via an op-ed in The Washington Post.\n\nFWD.us was backed by other tech leaders, including LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Dropbox cofounder Drew Houston, and VC and \"All In\" cohost Chamath Palihapitiya.\n\nIn 2024, Mark Zuckerberg met with Trump advisor Stephen Miller, who reportedly raised questions about CZI's ties to FWD.us, one person familiar with the matter said.\n\nZuckerberg has met and dined with Trump multiple times since his reelection and Meta contributed $1 million toward his inaugural fund, as well as helping fund the White House's new ballroom.\n\nAnd in a move widely viewed as an effort to curry favor with the Trump administration, Zuckerberg reversed course earlier this year on some Facebook and Instagram policy initiatives that had been previously criticized by conservatives. In January, Meta replaced its third-party fact-checkers with community notes and loosened its definition of hate speech. And in September, the CEO pledged a $600 billion US investment from Meta.\n\nIn November, Zuckerberg and Chan announced that they would shift CZI's focus to science and AI. The philanthropy now focuses on Biohub, a group of biology labs it has supported since 2016.\n\nCZI's recruiting pitch? They've got GPUs, Chan said in July. Zuckerberg later said that CZI researchers don't want more employees or office space; they want more GPUs.",

    "fullText": "CHICAGO, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Allyson Lopez had been hoping for business to bounce back at her dress shop in Chicago's Little Village neighborhood, which specializes in ballgowns for quinceaneras, a coming-of-age ritual in many Latino communities celebrating a girl's 15th birthday. Instead, this week brought the return of the federal immigration raids that have emptied the normally vibrant streets.\n\nThe first phase of the Department of Homeland Security deportation campaign, named \"Operation ​Midway Blitz,\" racked up over 4,200 arrests across the city in under three months. The operation rattled Chicago, but for Little Village, the working-class Mexican neighborhood that was repeatedly targeted, the effect has been catastrophic.\n\nThe return of roving U.S. ‌Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino on Tuesday in a large convoy of agents in camouflage, some with assault rifles peeking through car windows, was met by jeers and whistles from dozens of protesters who livestreamed the encounters on social media.\n\nAt Estela's Bridal, a second-generation family business, Lopez specializes in custom designs, which sell for ‌an average of $1,000. It can take 16 hours to make a dress, fitting the shimmering fabrics to size, and adding embroidered flowers, rhinestones and sequins. She said she lost 90% of her clients during the first wave of arrests as people decided to stay home out of fear of immigration agents.\n\nBUSINESS STRUGGLES TO MAKE RENT\n\n\"We’re going to suffer again as businesses,\" Lopez said. “We didn’t even make the rent this month, so it’s scary.\"\n\nA DHS spokesperson did not respond when asked about the impact of the raids on businesses.\n\nEven before Bovino's return, Little Village had been deflated by the raids.\n\nThe tourists who came to the \"Mexican Capital of the Midwest\" to eat tacos, sweet bread and tamales and to shop for quinceanera dresses, pinatas and Mexican chiles disappeared. Dozens of neighborhood residents were detained or deported, community leaders said. Others went ⁠into hiding.\n\n\"It's like those old Western movies where all you see is tumbleweeds blowing in ‌the breeze,” said Roxana, a 42-year-old hair salon owner from Guatemala. She declined to share her last name or immigration status out of fear of retaliation from immigration agents.\n\nIn her empty hair salon, with half the chairs wrapped in plastic, Roxana pulled back her neatly styled bangs to reveal patches of thinning hair, which she said started falling out from the stress of an 80% drop in revenue since ‍the start of the immigration enforcement campaign.\n\nAs the Border Patrol convoy descended on Little Village again this week, Roxana shuddered. The salon was open, but devoid of customers.\n\n\"They've broken into the neighborhood again,\" she said. \"It's definitely shocked and devastated us because it wasn't something that we were expecting.\"\n\nA NEIGHBORHOOD'S COMMERCIAL HEART\n\nRoxana's salon sits near the stucco arch that marks the beginning of 26th Street, a two-mile-long strip of shops, bakeries and restaurants that has become the second-most profitable shopping corridor in the city, according to the Little Village Chamber of Commerce. Many business owners said their savings dwindled ​after customers, including people who are in the U.S. legally, stopped visiting for fear of immigration officers.\n\nBefore the immigration crackdown, the shops selling elaborate ballgowns, glittering tiaras and satin flower bouquets, were joyous places, where girls giggled and twirled in their dresses ‌to the satisfaction of their mothers, shop owners said.\n\nBut anxiety over venturing outside – as well as fears that big parties could become targets for immigration enforcement – have hit Little Village’s quinceanera shops hard.\n\nTwo shop owners said they lost 90% of their revenue to the initial stages of Midway Blitz.\n\nEvelyn Flores, the owner of the Alborada quinceanera store, said she laid off seven staff members. “I can't sleep at night right now, and during the day I'm always freaking out.”\n\nMaria Ortiz, who owns a shop selling party supplies, said there are days when nobody walks into her store.\n\nFor one family, the aftershocks of the fall raids have lingered for weeks. Kamila, 15, said she has been afraid to leave her apartment other than to go to school after her cousin was detained by immigration agents in November while on his way to a job as a rug installer. He had been living in the U.S. for 18 years without legal status.\n\n“I’m scared. We can’t step outside because they might be waiting for us,\" she said.\n\nAsked for ⁠comment, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said: “There’s no reason to be afraid of law enforcement, unless you are breaking ​the law.\"\n\nThe cousin’s small apartment sits mostly as he left it - the bed unmade and his fluffy cream-colored dog, Peluchin, scampering through the apartment. Every day ​since his owner was detained, Peluchin pushes the dusty window blinds aside with his small snout to stare for hours at the street, waiting for him to return, a neighbor who comes by to walk him said.\n\n“All his dreams, all his effort, all his work – it’s here, empty,” said Sofia, Kamila’s mother and a 47-year-old housekeeper.\n\n“My daughter is 15 years old, she shouldn’t be living like this,” said Sofia, who came ‍to the U.S. from Mexico without legal status and is considering ⁠self-deporting. “There’s not a life here.”\n\nOn a recent afternoon, the Little Village Community Council hummed with overlapping voices as people coordinated school pick-ups, shared videos, and called family members of people who were detained.\n\nThe LVCC president, Baltazar Enriquez, has led local resistance to immigration enforcement, organizing patrols for federal agents and distributing plastic whistles now used across the city to warn of immigration agents in the area.\n\nThe tight-knit nature of “La Villita,” the Spanish name for Little Village, has given residents an ⁠organizing edge as they take to WhatsApp, Facebook and Signal groups to coordinate. Though Little Village has long struggled with bouts of gun violence and has the highest number of gang-related crimes in the city, residents said they felt safe before federal agents came to town.\n\nOther forms of resistance have been quieter – like Vicky Martinez, ‌a 55-year-old resident, who drops off groceries for friends and neighbors who are too scared to go to the store.\n\n\"It just feels like you're in prison. We don't even know what they're gonna throw at us,” ‌Martinez said.",

He was found dead Thursday evening from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, officials said.\n\nNeves Valente had studied at Brown on a student visa beginning in 2000, according to an affidavit from a Providence police detective. In 2017, he was issued a diversity immigrant visa and months later obtained legal permanent residence status, according to the affidavit. It was not immediately clear where he was between taking a leave of absence from the school in 2001 and getting the visa in 2017.\n\nThe diversity visa program makes up to 50,000 green cards available each year by lottery to people from countries that are little represented in the U.S., many of them in Africa. The lottery was created by Congress, and the move is almost certain to invite legal challenges.\n\nNearly 20 million people applied for the 2025 visa lottery, with more than 131,000 selected when including spouses with the winners. After winning, they must undergo vetting to win admission to the United States. Portuguese citizens won only 38 slots.\n\nLottery winners are invited to apply for a green card. They are interviewed at consulates and subject to the same requirements and vetting as other green-card applicants.\n\nTrump has long opposed the diversity visa lottery. Noem’s announcement is the latest example of using tragedy to advance immigration policy goals. After an Afghan man was identified as the gunman in a fatal attack on National Guard members in November, Trump’s administration imposed sweeping rules against immigration from Afghanistan and other counties.\n\nWhile pursuing mass deportation, Trump has sought to limit or eliminate avenues to legal immigration. He has not been deterred if they are enshrined in law, like the diversity visa lottery, or the Constitution, as with a right to citizenship for anyone born on U.S. soil. The Supreme Court recently agreed to hear his challenge to birthright citizenship.",

    "fullText": "A Kansas tribe said it has walked away from a nearly $30 million federal contract to come up with preliminary designs for immigrant detention centers after facing a wave of online criticism.\n\nThe Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation 's announcement Wednesday night came just over a week after the economic development leaders who brokered the deal with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement were fired.\n\nWith some Native Americans swept up and detained in recent ICE raids, the deal was derided online as “disgusting” and “cruel.\" Many in Indian Country also questioned how a tribe whose own ancestors were uprooted two centuries ago from the Great Lakes region and corralled on a reservation south of Topeka could participate in the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts.\n\nTribal Chairman Joseph “Zeke” Rupnick nodded to the historic issues last week in a video address that called reservations \"the government’s first attempts at detention centers.” In an update Wednesday, he announced that he was “happy to share that our Nation has successfully exited all third-party related interests affiliated with ICE.”\n\nThe Prairie Band Potawatomi has a range of businesses that provide health care management staffing, general contracting and even interior design. And Rupnick said in his latest address that tribal officials plan to meet in January about how to ensure “economic interests do not come into conflict with our values in the future.”\n\nA tribal offshoot hired by ICE — KPB Services LLC — was established in April in Holton, Kansas, by Ernest C. Woodward Jr., a former naval officer who markets himself as a “go-to” adviser for tribes and affiliated companies seeking to land federal contracts.\n\nThe Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation said in 2017 that Woodward’s firm advised it on its acquisition of another government contractor, Mill Creek LLC, which specializes in outfitting federal buildings and the military with office furniture and medical equipment.\n\nWoodward also is listed as the chief operating officer of the Florida branch of Prairie Band Construction Inc., which was registered in September.\n\nAttempts to locate Woodward were unsuccessful. A spokesperson for KPB said Woodward is no longer with the LLC but she declined to say whether he was terminated. Woodward did not respond to an email sent to another consulting firm he’s affiliated with, Virginia-based Chinkapin Partners LLC.\n\nA spokesperson for the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation said the tribe divested from KPB. While that company still has the contract, “Prairie Band no longer has a stake,” the spokesperson said.\n\nThe spokesperson said Woodward is no longer with the tribe's limited liability corporation, but she declined to say whether he was terminated.\n\nThe ICE contract initially was awarded in October for $19 million for unspecified “due diligence and concept designs” for processing centers and detention centers throughout the U.S., according to a one-sentence description of the work on the federal government’s real-time contracting database. It was modified a month later to increase the payout ceiling to $29.9 million.\n\nSole-source contracts above $30 million require additional justification under federal contracting rules.\n\nTribal leaders and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security haven’t responded to detailed questions about why the firm was selected for such a big contract without having to compete for the work as federal contracting normally requires. It’s also unclear what the Tribal Council knew about the contract.\n\n“That process of internal auditing is really just beginning,” the tribal spokesperson said.\n\nHollingsworth reported from Mission, Kansas, and Goodman from Miami.",

    "title": "Trump Administration Aims to Strip More Foreign-Born Americans of Citizenship",
    "description": "An official with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said it would prioritize “those who’ve unlawfully obtained U.S. citizenship.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration plans to ramp up efforts to strip some naturalized Americans of their citizenship, according to internal guidance obtained by The New York Times, marking an aggressive new phase in President Trump’s immigration crackdown.\n\nThe guidance, issued on Tuesday to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services field offices, asks that they “supply Office of Immigration Litigation with 100-200 denaturalization cases per month” in the 2026 fiscal year. If the cases are successful, it would represent a massive escalation of denaturalization in the modern era, experts said. By comparison, between 2017 and this year to date, there had been just over 120 cases filed, according to the Justice Department.\n\nUnder federal law, people may be denaturalized only if they committed fraud while applying for citizenship, or in a few other narrow circumstances. But the Trump administration has shown a zeal for using every tool at its disposal to target legal and illegal immigrants, leading activists to warn that such a campaign could sweep up people who had made honest mistakes on their citizenship paperwork and sow fear among law-abiding Americans.\n\nThe guidance comes as Mr. Trump has spent much of this year closing loopholes in the immigration system and throwing up roadblocks for people seeking to enter and stay in the country. The sweeping campaign, which has gone further than purging the country of unlawful migrants, has included blocks on asylum at the southern border, a pause on asylum applications inside the United States, and a ban on entry for travelers from predominantly African and Middle Eastern nations. Officials say their actions will make the country safer and preserve the country’s values\n\nA targeted campaign to increase the number of American immigrants stripped of their citizenship represents an escalation of an already ambitious campaign.\n\n“It’s no secret that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ war on fraud includes prioritizing those who’ve unlawfully obtained U.S. citizenship — especially under the previous administration,” said Matthew J. Tragesser, a U.S.C.I.S. spokesman. “We will pursue denaturalization proceedings for those individuals lying or misrepresenting themselves during the naturalization process. We look forward to continuing to work with the Department of Justice to restore integrity to America’s immigration system.”\n\nIn interviews, some former agency officials expressed concern at the scale of the case goals for denaturalization pushed by U.S.C.I.S. leadership.\n\n“Imposing arbitrary numerical targets on denaturalization cases risks politicizing citizenship revocation,” said Sarah Pierce, a former U.S.C.I.S. official. “And requiring monthly quotas that are 10 times higher than the total annual number of denaturalizations in recent years turns a serious and rare tool into a blunt instrument and fuels unnecessary fear and uncertainty for the millions of naturalized Americans.”\n\nProponents of stricter immigration laws said it was necessary to more aggressively root out people who had been improperly granted citizenship.\n\n“I don’t think we’re anywhere close to denaturalizing too many people,” said Mark Krikorian, the head of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors restrictive immigration policies. Mr. Krikorian said that the country was “so far from denaturalizing” enough people that such an effort would not pull in people who should not be targeted.\n\nThere are about 26 million naturalized Americans in the country, according to the Census Bureau. More than 800,000 new citizens were sworn in last year, most of whom were born in Mexico, India, the Philippines, the Dominican Republic or Vietnam, U.S.C.I.S. statistics show. Most people stripped of their citizenship revert to being legal permanent residents.\n\nThe new guidance on Tuesday was part of a document laying out U.S.C.I.S. priorities for the 2026 fiscal year, which began in October. Listed alongside such goals as “provide employee feedback opportunities” and “strengthen management of high-risk cases” was “pursue denaturalization.”\n\nThe Justice Department previously also said it would make denaturalization a priority this year. In a memo distributed in the summer, officials laid out their approach, saying they would target individuals in an array of categories beyond committing fraud in obtaining citizenship. Categories of eligible people include gang members, those who committed financial fraud, individuals connected to drug cartels and violent criminals, according to the department.\n\n“The civil division shall prioritize and maximally pursue denaturalization proceedings in all cases permitted by law and supported by the evidence,” the agency wrote in June.\n\nU.S.C.I.S. is a key player in the process of denaturalization. The agency refers cases to the Justice Department, which must go through a federal court to strip someone of their citizenship. The process can occur either through a civil or a criminal proceeding. During a civil case, government lawyers must have “unequivocal evidence” that someone obtained citizenship illegally or hid a material fact during the process.\n\nBecause the government must go through a challenging court process, denaturalization cases have been rare since the 1990s. A Bloomberg Law analysis found that denaturalization cases brought by the government since then peaked in 2018, when 90 criminal and civil cases were filed. “The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that citizenship and naturalization are too precious and fundamental to our democracy for the government to take it away on their whim. Instead of wasting resources digging through Americans’ files, U.S.C.I.S. should do its job of processing applications, as Congress mandated,” said Amanda Baran, a former senior U.S.C.I.S. official in the Biden administration.\n\nMr. Trump stepped up denaturalizations in his first term as well. In one widely publicized case, a New Jersey man born in India, Baljinder Singh, was stripped of his citizenship after the Justice Department found that he had arrived in the country without travel documents or proof of identity and that he had used a different name.\n\nThis year, the Justice Department has brought 13 denaturalization cases and won eight of them, according to Chad Gilmartin, an agency spokesman. Mr. Gilmartin said in a social media post earlier this year that there had been over 100 cases filed to the courts during the first Trump administration, compared with 24 during the Biden administration. In 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that the government must prove not only that someone had lied during the citizenship application process but that the lie had an impact on the underlying citizenship claim.\n\nExperts said that despite the ramp-up in referrals, the process to actually denaturalize someone would likely remain quite difficult, raising questions on whether the government will actually be able to get many cases through.\n\nStill, some had concerns about what the guidance could portend.\n\n“My fear would be that as we have seen in the arrest and removal context when D.H.S. employees are given arbitrary targets what happens is people who shouldn’t be swept up, get swept up and that you’re going to see that happening to people in this context as well,” said Margy O’Herron, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center, a nonpartisan law and policy organization. “That could incite fear and terror amongst naturalized citizens.”",

    "description": "These are the largest immigration groups in the U.S. and how they came here.",
    "fullText": "America has always been a nation shaped — and reshaped — by waves of immigration, but few eras have been as politically charged or emotionally fraught as the current moment. With record numbers of people arriving at the border, legal pathways in constant flux, and immigration dominating nearly every election-cycle debate, the question of who is coming to the United States — and how they are getting here — has become one of the country’s fiercest hot-button issues. Politicians weaponize it, communities feel its impact, and families live its consequences every day.\n\nBut behind the headlines, outrage, and policy battles lies a deeper, more human story: millions of people from around the world building lives, roots, and futures across the U.S. Their journeys are as diverse as their destinations — shaped by conflict, climate change, opportunity, and the promise that America still represents for so many. Understanding the largest immigrant groups in the country — and the routes, risks, and realities of how they arrived — offers a broader, clearer picture of the nation’s identity and the forces shaping its future.\n\nHere are the largest immigrant populations in the U.S. today — and the stories behind how they got here.\n\nMexican immigrants have long been the largest group of foreign-born residents in the U.S., making up a significant portion of the population. They often arrive through family reunification, employment opportunities, or seeking asylum from violence and economic hardship. Living predominantly in states like California, Texas, and Arizona, they have profoundly influenced American cuisine, music, and the labor market. While many face challenges such as legal hurdles and societal prejudice, their contribution to the U.S. is undeniable.\n\nThe Pew Research Center highlights that Mexican immigrants have increasingly become naturalized citizens, reflecting deeper integration into American society. This trend speaks to a growing commitment to establishing roots and participating in civic life. Despite political debates surrounding immigration policy, the Mexican community's resilience and adaptability continue to shape their American experience. They prove that while borders may separate lands, communities can build bridges through shared values and aspirations.\n\nIndia stands as the second-largest source of immigrants to the U.S., with many arriving on employment-based visas thanks to their high educational attainment. Indian immigrants often excel in fields such as technology, medicine, and academia, significantly contributing to these industries' growth. Silicon Valley, in particular, has seen a remarkable influence from Indian professionals, leading to a fusion of innovation and cultural exchange. Yet, beneath the surface of professional success lies the personal challenge of balancing dual cultures and identities.\n\nFor many Indian immigrants, community centers and cultural festivals provide a vital link to their heritage. These events offer a space to share traditions with younger generations and foster a sense of belonging. While adapting to a new country comes with its own set of hurdles, the Indian community’s strong family ties and cultural pride are central to their resilience. Their ability to integrate while preserving their rich cultural heritage is a testament to the enduring spirit of immigrants everywhere.\n\nChinese immigrants have a storied history in the U.S., dating back to the Gold Rush era, and continue to be one of the largest immigrant groups today. Many arrive through student visas, seeking education and the American Dream, while others come through employment-based channels. Major cities like New York and San Francisco host vibrant Chinatowns, which have become cultural landmarks offering a taste of China right in the U.S. These communities serve as a hub for new arrivals, providing familiar languages and customs in a foreign land.\n\nA study from the Migration Policy Institute notes that Chinese immigrants have seen a notable increase in family-based green cards, indicating a trend towards long-term settlement. This shift suggests a burgeoning commitment to building lives in America, complete with family and community. While they face significant challenges, such as navigating immigration laws and combating stereotypes, their journey is marked by perseverance and cultural exchange. The Chinese American narrative is one of blending tradition with modernity, crafting a unique identity within the American mosaic.\n\nThe Filipino community represents a significant portion of the immigrant population, with many arriving in the U.S. through family-sponsored visas and employment in healthcare and service industries. Their presence is particularly strong in states like California and Hawaii, where they have woven their cultural traditions into the American fabric. Filipino immigrants often bring with them a rich tapestry of cultural customs, from vibrant festivals to culinary delights, contributing to the multicultural landscape of the U.S. Despite the distance from home, strong familial bonds and a supportive diaspora network provide a safety net for many.\n\nFilipino immigrants frequently navigate the challenges of assimilation while maintaining ties to their heritage. The community often relies on faith and communal gatherings as pillars of support, helping to ease the transition into American life. With a high proficiency in English, Filipinos often integrate more smoothly into the workforce, though they still encounter obstacles such as wage disparities and discrimination. Their resilience and community-focused approach not only enrich their lives but also those of the broader American society.\n\nEl Salvadorans represent the largest Central American immigrant group in the U.S., many of whom have fled violence and economic instability. They predominantly settle in urban areas like Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., where robust communities have developed over the years. These immigrants often face the dual challenge of dealing with trauma from their home country while adapting to a new and sometimes unwelcoming environment. Despite these hurdles, the Salvadoran community is known for its strong work ethic and cultural pride.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Temporary Protected Status (TPS) has provided a lifeline for many Salvadorans, allowing them to live and work in the U.S. even if their immigration status is uncertain. This status has offered a sense of stability, although its future remains a political hot topic. The Salvadoran community's resilience is evident in their rich cultural expressions and community-building efforts. From vibrant pupuserías to cultural festivals, they contribute to the diverse tapestry of American life.\n\nVietnamese immigrants have established a significant presence in the U.S., many arriving as refugees following the Vietnam War. Over the decades, they have built thriving communities, especially in states like California and Texas. Vietnamese Americans have enriched the cultural landscape, with contributions ranging from cuisine to art and business. Yet, the journey to establishing these communities has been fraught with challenges, including overcoming language barriers and trauma from their war-torn past.\n\nCommunity support and family networks play a crucial role in the Vietnamese American experience. These immigrants often prioritize education and economic stability, with a strong focus on future generations. While they continue to navigate the complexities of identity and belonging, Vietnamese Americans have made indelible contributions to the cultural and economic fabric of the nation. Their story is one of perseverance, triumph, and the enduring American Dream.\n\nCuban immigrants have a unique immigration story, often driven by political factors, with many seeking refuge from communist rule. The Cuban American community has a prominent presence in cities like Miami, where they have significantly influenced local politics and culture. Cuban immigrants have historically benefited from favorable immigration policies, such as the Cuban Adjustment Act, which provided a pathway to legal residency. This facilitated their integration into American society, allowing them to become influential both economically and politically.\n\nThe Migration Policy Institute highlights that Cuban immigrants tend to have higher rates of naturalization compared to other Latin American groups. This has enabled them to wield considerable political power, particularly in Florida, where their votes can sway elections. Despite facing challenges such as cultural adaptation and generational divides, Cuban Americans continue to thrive. Their journey is marked by a profound love for both their homeland and their adopted country, reflecting the complex nature of immigrant identity.\n\nDominican immigrants have carved out vibrant communities across the U.S., particularly in New York City, where they form a significant part of the city's cultural mosaic. Many Dominicans come to the U.S. in search of better economic opportunities, often through family reunification or employment visas. Their influence is evident in the lively neighborhoods of Washington Heights and the Bronx, where Dominican culture is celebrated through music, dance, and cuisine. Yet, beneath the vibrant exterior lies the challenge of navigating racial and economic disparities.\n\nThe Dominican community places a strong emphasis on family ties and cultural heritage, often maintaining connections with relatives back home. This transnational identity shapes their American experience, influencing everything from business ventures to community activism. As they continue to tackle issues like immigration status and socioeconomic barriers, Dominicans in the U.S. remain steadfast in their pursuit of the American Dream. Their resilience and cultural pride are key components of their identity and strength.\n\nGuatemalan immigrants form a growing part of the U.S. immigrant landscape, with many fleeing violence and poverty in their home country. They often settle in states like California and Florida, where established communities offer support and resources. Their contribution to American society is most evident in sectors such as agriculture and construction, where they play a crucial role. However, Guatemalan immigrants often face significant challenges, including navigating complex immigration processes and overcoming language barriers.\n\nStrong community networks and a commitment to cultural preservation help Guatemalans maintain a sense of identity amidst the challenges of immigrant life. Cultural events and festivals serve as a reminder of their roots, offering a sense of belonging and unity. As they strive for better opportunities, Guatemalans continue to enrich the diverse American tapestry. Their journey is one of hope, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to building a better future.\n\nKorean immigrants have made significant strides in the U.S., establishing vibrant communities and contributing to various industries. Many Koreans arrive through employment-based visas or family sponsorship, settling in cities like Los Angeles and New York. Korean cultural influence is widely felt, from the global popularity of K-pop to the culinary delights of Korean barbecue. Yet, the path to integration is often marked by challenges such as navigating linguistic barriers and achieving economic stability.\n\nThe Korean American community places a high value on education, often pushing successive generations towards academic and professional success. This focus has led to a strong presence in fields like medicine, technology, and business. While they face challenges like racial discrimination and intergenerational gaps, their resilience and community solidarity are formidable. Korean Americans continue to be a vital part of the U.S. cultural and economic landscape, blending tradition with modernity in their pursuit of the American Dream.\n\nHonduran immigrants are part of the growing Central American presence in the U.S., often escaping violence and economic strife back home. Many settle in states such as Texas and Florida, where established communities provide a sense of familiarity and support. Hondurans contribute significantly to sectors like agriculture and service industries, bolstering the American economy with their hard work and dedication. However, the journey to stability is often fraught with obstacles, including the challenges of legal status and economic disparities.\n\nCommunity organizations and networks play a crucial role in supporting Honduran immigrants as they navigate their new lives. These groups offer resources and advocacy, helping to address issues like access to education and healthcare. Despite the challenges they face, Hondurans in the U.S. remain committed to building better futures for themselves and their families. Their stories are marked by hope, resilience, and the determination to overcome adversity.\n\nJamaican immigrants have a long history in the U.S., known for their vibrant culture and significant contributions to American music and sports. Many Jamaicans arrive through employment visas or family reunification, with a strong presence in cities like New York and Miami. Their cultural influence is profound, seen in the popularity of reggae music, jerk cuisine, and the achievements of figures like Usain Bolt. Yet, while they enrich the cultural landscape, Jamaican immigrants also grapple with challenges like racial discrimination and economic inequality.\n\nThe Jamaican community is characterized by its strong sense of identity and pride, often celebrating their heritage through festivals and community events. These gatherings offer a space to preserve culture and foster connections, providing support in navigating the complexities of immigrant life. As they continue to contribute to American society, Jamaicans demonstrate resilience and adaptability. Their story is one of cultural exchange, perseverance, and the enduring quest for the American Dream.\n\nColombian immigrants have established flourishing communities in the U.S., particularly in states like Florida and New York. Many Colombians come in search of better economic opportunities, fleeing violence and instability in their home country. Their influence is felt in various sectors, from business ventures to cultural festivals, adding to the rich tapestry of American society. However, the path to integration is often marked by challenges, including legal hurdles and economic disparities.\n\nCommunity support and cultural pride are central to the Colombian immigrant experience. Through vibrant events and traditions, Colombians maintain a connection to their heritage while navigating their new lives. Despite the obstacles they face, Colombians in the U.S. remain committed to building better futures for themselves and their families. Their resilience and cultural contributions continue to shape the American narrative, showcasing the enduring spirit of immigrants everywhere.\n\nHaitian immigrants form a vital part of the U.S. immigrant community, many arriving as refugees from political turmoil and natural disasters. They primarily settle in states like Florida and New York, where strong diaspora networks offer support and resources. Haitian culture is vividly expressed through art, music, and cuisine, enriching the American cultural landscape. Yet, the journey to stability is often challenging, with issues such as legal status and economic inequality posing significant hurdles.\n\nFaith and community play a crucial role in the Haitian American experience, providing a foundation for navigating the complexities of immigrant life. Churches and community organizations offer a sense of belonging and advocacy, helping Haitians address issues like housing and education. Despite the challenges they face, Haitians remain resilient and determined, contributing significantly to American society. Their story is one of perseverance, cultural pride, and the unyielding pursuit of the American Dream.\n\nBrazilian immigrants are an emerging presence in the U.S., drawn by economic opportunities and political stability. Many settle in states like Massachusetts and Florida, where vibrant communities offer cultural familiarity and support. Brazilian culture is celebrated through festivals, music, and cuisine, adding to the diverse American mosaic. However, the path to integration is often marked by challenges, including legal hurdles and cultural adaptation.\n\nCommunity support and cultural pride are central to the Brazilian immigrant experience. Through vibrant events and traditions, Brazilians maintain a connection to their heritage while embracing their new lives. Despite the obstacles they face, Brazilians in the U.S. remain committed to building better futures for themselves and their families. Their resilience and cultural contributions continue to shape the American narrative, showcasing the enduring spirit of immigrants everywhere.",

    "title": "Rich Western countries face a stark choice: 6-day workweeks or more immigration, top economist warns",
    "description": "One of the world's foremost economists, Lant Pritchett, has a plan.",
    "fullText": "Eva is a fellow on Fortune's news desk.\n\nA specter is haunting Europe—the specter of aging.\n\nMany Western countries are facing what the World Bank calls a “profound demographic crisis.” The twin perils of an aging population and record-low fertility rates are predicted to send their populations plunging in the coming decades.\n\nThe worst consequences of this demographic shift, per the World Bank, are economic. Soon the shrinking working population in the U.S., Canada, or Germany won’t be able to meet their own constant demands for high-quality goods and services. These rich, senescent countries will have to make a hard choice for economic survival: force people to work more, or allow immigrants to fill in?\n\nLant Pritchett, one of the world’s top thinkers on developmental economics, has seen this crisis coming for decades over his career at Harvard, the World Bank, and Oxford University, where he currently heads a research lab. He told Fortune his radical plan to stave off economic disaster.\n\nIn the long run, without intervention, the UN predicts a decline in population growth could cascade into a full-on population “collapse.” That collapse is not likely to occur until well into the next century—if it comes at all. However, in the short run, population decline presents a real and relatively simple economic problem: The West soon won’t have enough workers.\n\nThe ratio of working-age people to elderly people in rich countries will soon become so diminished that support for elders will be unaffordable. In Japan, a nation already facing the consequences of a graying population, the average cost of nursing care is projected to increase 75% in the next 30 years, with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida warning the nation is on “the brink.” In the U.S., think tanks have warned, an older population with more retirees means a shrinking tax base and higher demands on programs like Social Security and Medicare, along with a smaller number of working-age people to pay into those programs.\n\nIn short, we have a “ticking time bomb” on our hands, in the words of Greece’s Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, whose government introduced a six-day workweek last year to address the nation’s labor shortages. The move prompted fury and protests among workers as they watched their German and Belgian cousins embrace four-day workweeks.\n\nIndeed, even as some European countries and a few American companies flirt with working less, panicked economists and politicians are sounding the alarm: We need to work more. A study conducted by consulting firm Korn Ferry found by 2030, there will be a global human talent shortage of more than 85 million people, roughly equivalent to the population of Germany. That talent shortage could slash $8.5 trillion from nations’ expected revenues, affecting highly educated sectors such as financial services and IT as well as manufacturing jobs, which are considered “lower skilled” and require less education.\n\nNow is the time to act, economic veteran Pritchett told Fortune. But doing so involves some radical rethinking of the current immigration debate.\n\nClassical economics offers a number of ways to address a labor shortage, Pritchett said. Since most of the unfilled jobs are “unskilled,” or don’t require a degree to complete, one solution for businesses and governments is to invest in automation, essentially having robots fill the gap. But while automation helps get the jobs done, it depresses human workers’ wages by decreasing the number of jobs available, “exacerbating” the issue, Pritchett said.\n\nSome have called for increasing wages to induce more people to work. But most of the working-age population in the U.S. is already employed. Despite a well-documented decline in the portion of working-age men with jobs over the past few decades, Pritchett said the vast majority of working-age men are working, meaning raising pay would have small effects at best. There’s room for more women to work, he noted, but that could take away from other important responsibilities that are overwhelmingly shunted to women, such as caring for family or raising children.\n\nThat leaves two other options: forcing workers to work more or allowing an influx of legal, controlled immigration.\n\nMitsotakis’s plan for a six-day workweek is a step in the right direction for the short term, Pritchett said.\n\nBut “economics is not just about direction: It’s about magnitude,” he added. In other words, he says, small policy tweaks won’t do it. If we’re trying to address a big, structural problem with the U.S. labor force, the solution needs to be ambitious and comprehensive—precisely the type of legislation American politicians have largely avoided in recent years.\n\nIf policymakers simply try to make everyone work an additional day, the math simply won’t work out in the long run, Pritchett said. Even if Greece has “fantastic success” and increases its working hours by 10% over the next 30 years, that growth would represent a “drop in the bucket” in fighting a worsening labor shortage. He calculated a demographic labor force gap of 232 million people globally in his most recent paper, even assuming the highest possible labor force participation rate.\n\n“You can’t solve a problem that’s growing over time with [a labor force] that has an upward bound,” he said. You would have to keep the labor force working more and more, and even then, you would never be able to fill in the gap.\n\nPritchett has a better idea. He knows the current immigration debate is fraught, since the West is concerned with the social ramifications of allowing more migrants into its borders. But he maintains the only way to solve rich countries’ labor problem is to let in immigrants to work, particularly from countries where population growth is increasing, such as Nigeria or Tanzania, rather than decreasing.\n\nIn his view, the Western debate on immigration has taken on an unnecessarily binary flavor, with the choice depicted as one between a path to citizenship or closed borders. In an article titled “The political acceptability of time-limited labor mobility,” Pritchett says the West will soon have to abandon this view. Instead, he advocates for developed nations to embrace a system where immigrants can come to their country to work for a limited time—while also buying goods and services, renting homes, starting companies, and hiring workers—and then go back home, leaving both parties wealthier.\n\nThe truth, Pritchett said, is the U.S. needs low-skilled migrants, and many migrants need the economic boost from working in the U.S. Immigration is a symbiotic relationship that the West cannot quit—that’s why it’s so hard for us to actually control our borders.\n\n“The way to secure the border is to create a legitimate way for people and firms to get the labor that the economy really needs in legitimate, legal ways, and until we have that, the whole debate over the wall and stuff is just silly,” Pritchett said.\n\nIf anything, the intensifying crackdown on undocumented and legal migration since the late 1980s has led to mass settlement, according to Hein de Haas, a sociologist of immigration. Prior to the 1980s, the U.S. and Mexico enjoyed a relationship similar to the work-visa program Pritchett envisions. Mexicans freely flowed across the border, coming for a short time to work, returning home to enjoy their money, and sometimes repeating this journey over several years, Haas wrote. They never permanently settled because, knowing they could come and go as they pleased, they did not have to.\n\nThe U.S. facilitated this temporary migration programs specifically aimed at Mexicans,  encouraging contract workers to come to the U.S. after  World War I and II. The second of these, the Bracero Program, established a treaty for the temporary employment of Mexican farmworkers in the U.S., and was so popular that it was extended far beyond its initial life span, allowing nearly 5 million Mexicans to temporarily work in the U.S. from 1942 to 1964. (The program ended in 1965, when the U.S. sharply limited immigration from Latin America as part of a major overhaul of immigration laws.)\n\nWhat Pritchett suggests isn’t too dissimilar from simply turning the clock back to a time when migrants could move and work freely. He proposes a fixed-term system: A worker comes to the U.S. with the understanding that they are not on a path to citizenship, works on a three-year contract, and then returns to their home country. After an “off period” of six months to a year, the migrant could come back for another three years.\n\n“There are a billion people on the planet who would come to the U.S. under those terms,” Pritchett said. “But we don’t have that available.”\n\nHe isn’t exaggerating about the billion. In a 2010 survey, Gallup asked people around the world whether they would like to temporarily move to work in another country. Some 1.1 billion responded “yes,” including 41% of the age 15-to-24 population and 28% of those ages 25-44, Pritchett said.\n\n“What you could make in America in three years and go back to Senegal with is a fortune compared to anything else you could do to make your way in Senegal,” he added. “You go back to Senegal, you build a house, you buy your own business, and you’ve transformed your life by working temporarily.”\n\nTo avoid potential labor shortages in sending nations, Pritchett’s system would depend on bilateral agreements between the host and sending countries, and nations “could choose to put limits on their participation” to address their own labor needs, Pritchett said.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. would receive fresh batches of workers for service industries, elderly care, or manufacturing—essentially, all the jobs that would be otherwise unfilled.\n\nPolicies like these are not yet being discussed on the national stage, but Pritchett believes that will soon change. With the upcoming labor shortage and the unpopularity of forcing workers to toil for longer, politicians will have to expand their understanding of immigration to allow for policies like his. For now, he’s planting the seed.\n\nIn partnership with economist Rebekah Smith, Pritchett has started an organization called Labor Mobility Partnerships (LaMP) that aims to build political support for a temporary rotational migration system. The way he sees it, nothing will change by pitching the idea to politicians (“who tend to be followers, not leaders”) so instead, he is working with countries that are currently already expanding their immigration channels, like Spain.\n\nHe is also courting business leaders in sectors that will be the hardest hit by labor shortages, such as elderly care, who could “be potentially a powerful force” in explaining to politicians why policies like his are necessary.\n\n“Ideas at times are like dams: huge, unmoving, impregnable, able to hold the water back forever,” Pritchett writes in the conclusion of his paper. “But a small, strategically placed crack can cause a dam to be washed away overnight.”\n\nA version of this story was published on Fortune.com on Aug. 4, 2024.",

    "fullText": "CASABLANCA, Morocco (AP) — Exposure to freezing temperatures near Morocco’s border with Algeria killed nine African migrants, a tragedy that rights groups in the North African country called deeply concerning and a violation of the right to freedom of movement.\n\nThe bodies of seven men and two women were found in Ras Asfour, a remote mountainous Moroccan area known for its plunging temperatures in winter, the Moroccan Association of Human Rights said Saturday in a statement.\n\n“They died from extreme cold, which their exhausted bodies could not withstand,” it said.\n\nOne of the migrants was from Guinea, the group said. The rest were from various countries throughout sub-Saharan Africa, though specific information about their identities remains unknown. Morocco’s Interior Ministry did not immediately respond to questions about the individuals who died.\n\nEvery year, thousands of migrants seeking better living conditions attempt to crossing illegal from North Africa to Europe, including from Morocco to Spain. Some aim for Ceuta and Melilla – two tiny Spanish enclaves in North Africa – by scaling border fences or swimming. Others attempt to reach Spain’s Canary Islands, taking a longer route through the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe North African nation’s security forces regularly report blocking such attempts.\n\nThroughout Europe and Africa, North Africa is known as a transit point for migrants en route to Europe’s southern border.\n\nSecurity agreements with the European Union have strengthen authorities' ability to deter migration in North Africa. Many who originally intended to migrate to Europe spend months or years working informally — doing construction, agriculture or domestic work. Others rely on aid while waiting for opportunities to cross the Mediterranean Sea or Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe Moroccan Association of Human Rights statement said six of the bodies were buried last week and two were kept at the request of their relatives. “We will make sure that this case is followed up on,” it said.\n\nThe Moroccan Organization of Human Rights — a different association — earlier this week called for the humanization of borders, the decriminalization of illegal migration and residence, and the creation of a mechanism to track missing migrants to prevent tragedies like the one in Ras Asfour.\n\nFollow AP’s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",

    "fullText": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia must be freed from immigration detention while he fights his deportation, a judge ruled Thursday, handing a major victory to the immigrant whose wrongful deportation to a notorious prison in El Salvador made him a flashpoint of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement to let Abrego Garcia go immediately, writing that federal authorities had detained him again after his return to the United States without any legal basis.\n\n“For this reason, the Court will GRANT Abrego Garcia’s Petition for immediate release from ICE custody,” the judge wrote.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security sharply criticized the decision and vowed to appeal, calling the ruling “naked judicial activism” by a judge appointed during the Obama administration.\n\n“This order lacks any valid legal basis, and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary. The judge gave prosecutors until 5 p.m. EST to formally respond to the release order.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment, and messages seeking comment from Abrego Garcia’s attorney were not immediately returned.\n\nAbrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national with an American wife and child, has lived in Maryland for years but entered the U.S. illegally as a teenager. An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that he could not be deported to El Salvador because he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family. When he was mistakenly sent there in March, his case became a rallying point for those who oppose President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement actions.\n\nA court later ordered his return to the United States. Since he cannot be removed to El Salvador, ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries. His federal suit claims the Trump administration is illegally using the removal process to punish Abrego Garcia for the public embarrassment caused by his deportation.\n\nIn her order releasing Abrego Garcia, Xinis wrote that federal authorities “did not just stonewall” the court, “They affirmatively misled the tribunal.” The judge was referencing the successive list of four African countries that officials had sought to remove Abrego Garcia seemingly without commitments from those countries, as well as officials' affirmations that Costa Rica withdrew its offer to accept him, a claim later proven untrue.\n\n“But Costa Rica had never wavered in its commitment to receive Abrego Garcia, just as Abrego Garcia never wavered in his commitment to resettle there,” the judge wrote.\n\nXinis also rejected the government’s argument that she lacked jurisdiction to intervene on a final removal order for Abrego Garcia, because she found no final order had been filed.\n\nSeparately, Abrego Garcia is asking an immigration court to reopen his case so he can seek asylum in the United States.\n\nHe is also criminally charged in Tennessee, where he has pleaded not guilty to human smuggling. He has asked the federal court to dismiss the case, arguing the prosecution is vindictive. His defense attorney in Tennessee, Sean Hecker, declined to comment.\n\nA judge in that case has ordered an evidentiary hearing after previously finding some evidence that the charges “may be vindictive.” The judge also noted several statements by Trump administration officials that “raise cause for concern,” including a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that seemed to suggest the Justice Department charged Abrego Garcia because he won his wrongful deportation case. ___\n\nLoller reported from Nashville, Seewer reported from Toledo, Ohio and Lauer reported from Philadelphia.

    "description": "Amanda...",
    "fullText": "In a text exchange, Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino calls his operation a “massive disturbance” in the making.\n\n“Operation Catahoula Crunch is making New Orleans safer by finding and arresting illegal aliens who have been endangering this community,” Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino posted on X shortly after his roving corps of immigration enforcers arrived in the city. In a similar PR offensive, the Department of Homeland Security recently launched the “Worst of the Worst” website, which features some of the arrests that the federal agents implementing the Trump White House’s mass deportation policy have carried out across the country. (The legal resolution of these arrests, like the 13 cases dropped in court after Bovino’s Operation Midway Blitz campaign in Chicago, are not featured.)\n\nAnd despite the online efforts to portray the Trump raids as heroic peacekeeping exercises, Commander Bovino’s New Orleans team seemed to be operating by a different set of rules, to judge by its conduct this past Saturday. A caravan of Louisiana state troopers escorted three rental cars full of federal agents, including Bovino himself, to an apartment complex in Kenner, Louisiana. A secondary caravan, made up mostly of journalists and protesters, followed close behind. State police blocked off a road in the complex, driving both groups out of their vehicles and into the street, where Bovino and his agents could move in on them. The federal agents slowly drove down the road, stopping for minutes at a time. The small group of protesters grew, bolstered by neighbors who lived in the apartments.\n\nSafe inside an SUV, surrounded by agents with weapons, Bovino texted away on his phone from the parking lot of an apartment complex. The messages, recorded by journalist Ford Fischer, offer some insight—into both Bovino’s mind and the state of the Louisiana operation.\n\n“Kind of cool we are a massive wrecking crew. The idiots can’t do anything to us…. I can’t understand why DHS is hiding us when we are handing them strategy on a silver platter,” Bovino wrote to a contact listed as “Diz.” Minutes later, Bovino followed up with a summary of their on-the-ground strategy that afternoon: “Massive disturbance at apartment complex in Kenner. We are running tags and such.”\n\nThe “disturbance” was hardly massive. The protesters were yelling at the agents as they sat in their vehicles with the windows up, but they didn’t offer any physical resistance. After running the tags of the cars down the length of the road, Border Patrol agents got out and knocked on a door. The sound of whistles pierced the air, and one loud protester yelled out for his neighbors not to open their doors: “They cannot come in if you do not give them verbal, allowed permission.”\n\nThe stunt seemed to be a way to agitate the neighborhood more than anything else. And the photos showing Bovino’s messages cast the operation’s alleged legal aims into further doubt. Just for starters, why would a targeted enforcement operation rely on running tags in the parking lot of an apartment complex located in the town with the highest Hispanic population in the state of Louisiana? This seemed to be a “Kavanaugh stop”—the practice of racially profiling residents recently sanctioned by the US Supreme Court—running on steroids.\n\nBovino’s reference to the DHS’s “hiding” his team raises further questions. It certainly seems at odds with his constant media appearances, and his photo-ops in the snack aisles of gas stations\n\nPerhaps Bovino was simply venting because the New Orleans raids aren’t producing the kind of strong-arm spectacle that he’s staged in Chicago and elsewhere. According to the Associated Press, his team has carried out just 38 arrests over the first four days of Operation Catahoula Crunch. And of the 38 people detained, only nine had criminal records—a percentage that’s generally in line with the national numbers for the immigration raids, which show that more than 70 percent of the people arrested had no criminal convictions.\n\nBovino’s texting partner, at least, seemed to be mindful of the team’s lackluster show of force. “You need to do interviews. Fox and friends wants you. We will come up for a talking point on the low numbers,” Diz texted Bovino.\n\nStill, when he doesn’t feel like he’s being hidden, Commander Bovino remains stoutly on message. “The Big Easy is the Big Hard for illegal aliens,” Bovino bragged this week on X.\n\nOver the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T.
