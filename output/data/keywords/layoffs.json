    "description": "Just two months ago at The Game Awards, host Geoff Keighley gave a show-closing preview to the raid shooter Highguard. But after struggling out of the gate, Highguard developer Wildlight was hit by massive layoffs, and some are pointing the finger at Keighley for creating high expectations that the dev team couldn't live up to. However, at least one prominent figure in the industry doesn't believe Keighley should shoulder the blame for any of this mess.\n\"The Highguard layoffs, like many others, are a sad reminder of the economic instability of an industry that asks the world, but promises little,\" wrote Baldur's Gate 3 director of publishing, Michael Douse on X. \"That said, blaming one man for showing a trailer on his telly show is a sophomoric take that shows little understanding of industry!",

    "description": "As a senior leader, your strongest advantage in today’s job market isn’t your titles, decades of experience, or a specific metric of success. It’s how your adaptability has transformed how you lead. How did you navigate layoffs without losing trust? How did you integrate AI into your team workflow without slowing momentum? How did you pivot when the strategy you built last year no longer made sense?",

    "description": "Aneel Bhusri returns as CEO of the software company, which he cofounded in 2005.",
    "fullText": "The CEO of Workday is leaving his post, a change that comes less than a week after the software provider laid off about 400 employees.\n\nCarl Eschenbach is being succeeded by Workday cofounder and executive chair Aneel Bhusri, who has held the top job three times before. The company — a software provider for payroll, talent management, and expense processing — said Eschenbach will become a strategic advisor to Bhusri.\n\n\"As we enter a defining moment shaped by AI, there is no one better than Aneel to lead this next chapter,\" said Mark Hawkins, Workday vice chair and lead independent director, in a public statement. \"His vision, conviction, and deep connection to Workday's culture will position the company to continue to lead in a changing landscape.\"\n\nShares of Workday are down roughly 6% today, and down about 43% from a year ago.\n\nBhusri previously served as Workday's co-CEO from 2009 to 2014 with cofounder Dave Duffield. He was also CEO from 2014 to 2020 and co-CEO from 2020 to 2024. Further, Bhusri has been a member of Workday's board since its founding in 2005.\n\nIn announcing the recent layoffs, which affected about 2% of Workday's overall workforce, the company cited a need to realign its resources to meet its top priorities. It didn't blame artificial intelligence as a reason for the cuts.\n\nWorkday also announced a larger round of layoffs last year, citing a need to invest more heavily in strategic areas such as AI. It had more than 20,400 employees as of January 31, 2025.\n\nWorkday was one of many software companies whose share prices took a beating last week following the debut of Anthropic's industry-specific Claude Cowork plugin, which can perform clerical tasks such as tracking compliance. Others included Intuit, Salesforce, and LegalZoom.\n\nLast month in an interview with CNBC, Eschenbach pushed back on the idea that AI advancements would negatively impact Workday.\n\n\"We are uniquely positioned to be one of the AI winners in the enterprise because of our incumbency, and lastly, because of the trust we get from our customers,\" he said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. \"We have the cleanest set of data in the industry, and AI is a tailwind for us. It's absolutely not a headwind.\"\n\nAre you a current or former employee at Workday? Contact Sarah E. Needleman at sneedleman@insider.com or via encrypted messaging app Signal at 732-991-1100.

    "title": "From layoffs to AI, BofA flags the 4 big takeaways for investors from earnings season",
    "description": "BofA strategists flagged earnings growth, C-suite sentiment, AI spending, and layoffs among their top takeaways from the latest results.",
    "fullText": "Earnings season is winding down, and some key takeaways for investors have emerged from the results.\n\nThe latest batch of financials has been largely upbeat, though there's lingering caution around things like AI capex plans from the biggest tech firms. Amazon, for instance, saw shares plunge after earnings last week as its spending plans shocked investors.\n\nYet, for the most part, Bank of America says that results have largely delivered despite lingering background noise about the AI arms race.\n\nWith about 75% of S&P 500 companies reporting, here are what BofA analysts say are the big takeaways for investors from fourth-quarter earnings season.\n\nGrowth is stronger than expected and above historic averages, but has stumbled on a quarter-over-quarter basis.\n\nNearly 70% of companies delivered earnings per share that beat consensus estimates, compared to the historical average of 60%. In the prior quarter, the beat rate was 75%, the strongest figure since 2021.\n\nSales for the companies that have reported so far are also strong. Bank of America noted that revenue excluding the financials and energy sectors is on pace for the highest year-over-year growth since 2022.\n\nBank of America's predictive analytics team examined earnings calls to assess sentiment among company executives. They found that positive corporate sentiment hit a record high.\n\n\"Corporate sentiment is tracking at a record high in 4Q, just above its pre-Liberation Day level. \"Weak demand\" mentions ticked higher but are still well below 2023-2024 levels.\"\n\nThey highlighted the tech and healthcare sectors as having the strongest guidance, while real estate and consumer staples were the weakest.\n\nAs expected, AI was a key focus for Wall Street this earnings season, especially amid AI disruption fears that are fueling volatility and investors' concerns about the return on colossal capex.\n\nHyper scalers' AI spending guidance came in 35% above Wall Street's expectations. Amazon plans to spend $200 billion this year, while Alphabet and Meta expect to spend up to $185 billion and $135 billion, respectively.\n\nThe strategists said that hyperscalers' capex guidance is decelerating year over year, but noted that 2025 capex was revised up by a \"whopping\" 30% from initial guidance.\n\nAmazon was punished by investors after it revealed its spending plans, with the stock plummeting after earnings. Other Big Tech names, however, fared better. Meta's capex outlook was offset by strength in its ad business, proving that investors can get comfortable with high AI spending if they like what they see elsewhere.\n\nJob cuts in January hit the highest point since 2009. Despite some worrying headlines about layoffs at high-profile companies like Amazon, Bank of America highlighted some \"less pessimistic\" readings into the labor market.\n\nThe strategists said that the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) layoff rate holds low, though hiring has fallen off — a low-hire, low-fire state.\n\nThey also noted that \"layoff\" mentions did tick up, but they see minimal evidence that AI is meaningfully weakening labor demand.",

    "title": "Jeff Bezos speaks out about The Washington Post for the first time since mass layoffs and focuses on 'data'",
    "description": "Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos has put out his first statement since the paper's cuts. He said \"data tells us what is valuable and where to focus.\"",
    "fullText": "Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos gave his first public statement since the paper enacted massive job cuts this week, and it focused on \"data\" and understanding reader interests.\n\nThe billionaire Amazon founder, who built one of the world's most valuable companies with a relentless focus on customer satisfaction, indicated he wanted to see that same energy at the Post.\n\n\"The Post has an essential journalistic mission and an extraordinary opportunity,\" Bezos wrote. \"Each and every day our readers give us a roadmap to success. The data tells us what is valuable and where to focus.\"\n\nBezos' statement came as Post CEO Will Lewis announced he was stepping down, to be replaced in an interim capacity by Post CFO Jeff D'Onofrio.\n\nIn his own statement, D'Onofrio said that \"customer data will drive our decisions, sharpening our edge in delivering what is most valuable to our audiences.\"\n\nBezos and D'Onofrio's statements struck a similar tone to comments made by the paper's top editor, Matt Murray, in addressing staff earlier this week.\n\n\"Today is about positioning ourselves to become more essential to people's lives in what has become a more crowded, competitive, and complicated media landscape,\" Murray said during a staff call on Wednesday. \"For too long, we've operated with a structure that's too rooted in the days when we were a quasi-monopoly local newspaper.\"\n\nFollowing the layoffs, Murray spoke repeatedly about focusing on areas of reader interest and understanding audience data in an appearance on the Puck podcast \"The Grill Room.\"\n\nHe said that when he was brought on, he felt the company hadn't \"fully embraced the digital internet revolution the right way.\"\n\nHe added that the company had a \"long way to go in using data — data to inform what we wrote, data to inform how we publish, data to understand our audience, data to understand our readers, data to understand our prospects.\"\n\nThe outspoken focus on data from Post leadership has drawn some criticism.\n\n\"'Customer data' is what has replaced 'focus group' for the same type of folks who pretty much killed Sports Illustrated by stamping out its originality and magnetism in favor of formulaic swill,\" The Atlantic's Sally Jenkins, formerly of the Post, wrote Saturday on X.\n\nStill, the messaging from Post leadership could help appease some critics who have seen management moves in recent years as rooted in political ideology and not data — though it will be difficult to win them over.\n\nThe Post faced a revolt both inside the newsroom and among readers when Bezos made a late-hour call in 2024 that the paper wouldn't endorse a presidential candidate for the first time in 36 years. NPR reported that more than 200,000 subscriptions were canceled in the days following.\n\nThe paper faced another round of criticism in February 2025 when Bezos decided to reorient the Post's opinion section — generally considered the owner's prerogative — around personal liberties and free markets.\n\nFormer Post executive editor Martin Baron, who worked closely with Bezos during his tenure atop the paper, wrote in a LinkedIn post after the layoffs that the Post's challenges had been made \"infinitely worse by ill-conceived decisions that came from the very top.\"\n\nCritics of Bezos' moves have said he should consider financially supporting the paper, given its role in society.\n\n\"It just seems heartbreaking that he doesn't feel the paper is important enough to bankroll,\" Sally Quinn, the longtime journalist and widow of former Post executive editor, Ben Bradlee, said this week on CNN.\n\nBezos said in his statement that he felt the Post's leadership going forward could build an \"exciting and thriving next chapter\" for the paper.",

The cuts were felt across the newsroom, including the sports section, international, books, DC metro, and audio.\n\nAs news of the layoffs spread, Lewis came under widespread public criticism, both for the financial challenges at the Post and for not participating in the dissemination of the news. After Murray made the staff-cut announcements himself, Lewis was seen attending Super Bowl festivities.\n\nIn a note Saturday, Lewis said \"now is the right time for me to step aside\" and thanked Jeff Bezos, the paper's owner.\n\nD'Onofrio, who joined the Post in June 2025, said in an email to staffers on Saturday: \"This is a challenging time across all media organizations, and The Post is unfortunately no exception.\"\n\nThis is a developing story.

    "fullText": "The Washington Post, owned by billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is conducting widespread layoffs.\n\nExecutive editor Matt Murray wrote in a Wednesday memo that the \"substantial newsroom reductions\" would impact \"nearly all news departments.\"\n\nThe layoffs impacted hundreds of workers, according to a spokesperson for the Washington Baltimore News Guild, which represents the newsroom's union.\n\nMurray told staff on a Wednesday morning call that the cuts were part of a strategic reset, according to an audio recording obtained by Business Insider.\n\nMurray said the changes included \"closing the sports department in its current form.\"\n\n\"We plan to retain several reporters to join features and cover sports as a cultural and societal phenomenon, as well as several folks to staff the print sports section,\" he added.\n\nMurray said impacted teams included audio and journalists who cover books, the DC metro area, and foreign affairs.\n\n\"A few products will be discontinued — among the most significant, we will be closing the book section and will be suspending the Post Reports podcast,\" Murray said.\n\nThe publication's San Francisco bureau was also heavily hit, one Post insider said.\n\nIn his memo, Murray wrote that for the immediate future, the paper would concentrate on \"areas that demonstrate authority, distinctiveness, and impact and that resonate with readers.\"\n\n\"These layoffs are not inevitable,\" the Washington Post Guild wrote in a statement posted to X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday. \"A newsroom cannot be hollowed out without consequences for its credibility, its reach, and its future.\"\n\nFormer executive editor Martin Baron wrote in a LinkedIn post that \"there were acute business problems that had to be addressed\" during \"a period of head-spinning change in media consumption.\" Baron added that the \"Post's challenges, however, were made infinitely worse by ill-conceived decisions that came from the very top.\"\n\nDonald Graham, the Post's former publisher, wrote in a Facebook post that he was saddened by the loss of \"so many excellent reporters and editors\" and that he would \"have to learn a new way to read the paper,\" as he had \"started with the sports page since the late 1940's.\"\n\n\"The Washington Post is taking a number of difficult but decisive actions today for our future, in what amounts to a significant restructuring across the company,\" a Post spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday. \"These steps are designed to strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets The Post apart and, most importantly, engages our customers.\"\n\nThis new round of layoffs follows a series of recent shake-ups at the 148-year-old newspaper.\n\nEarly last year, the company told its opinions desk that columnists should refocus their coverage to two pillars: \"personal liberties\" and \"free markets.\"\n\nIn March, the Post reorganized its newsroom in a push to shift away from \"commodity news.\" It then offered buy-outs to staffers in May.\n\nLast year's personnel shifts arrived shortly after the Washington Post came under fire from some readers for its decision to skip endorsing a candidate in the 2024 presidential election, breaking from a 35-year tradition. Some critics argued that the decision could have been made to curry favor with Donald Trump.\n\nOver 400 staffers sent a letter to Bezos last January, writing that they were \"deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency, and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave.\"\n\nThe Post's staff reductions arrive at a challenging moment for the media industry.\n\nSome brands are seeing revenue fall off due to declines in social media and search traffic. The rise of AI is also squeezing the industry as more readers gather information from chatbots rather than visiting web pages.\n\nThe New York Times, long seen as the 800-pound gorilla in the newspaper business, saw its shares sink about 14% on Monday as investors fretted about increased costs.",

    "fullText": "Digital pinboard business cutting 15% of workforce as it invests heavily in AI\n\nPinterest has fired two engineers who created a software tool to identify which workers had lost their jobs in a recent round of cuts and then shared the information, according to reports.\n\nThe digital pinboard business announced significant job cuts earlier this month, with the chief executive, Bill Ready, telling staff he was “doubling down on an AI-forward approach”, according to a LinkedIn post by a former employee.\n\nPinterest, which is based in San Francisco and has an office in London, said the cuts would affect about 15% of its workforce, or about 700 people, but did not specify which teams or staff members would be affected.\n\nTwo engineers at the company then wrote code to identify sacked staff.\n\nA spokesperson for Pinterest said: “Two engineers wrote custom scripts improperly accessing confidential company information to identify the locations and names of all dismissed employees and then shared it more broadly. This was a clear violation of Pinterest policy and of their former colleagues’ privacy.”\n\nIt is unclear whether the engineers, who have not been named, shared the information with colleagues, or with people outside Pinterest.\n\nThe script – a set of commands written to automate a task within existing software or change its function – was aimed at internal tools for workers to communicate, the BBC reported, citing an anonymous source.\n\nThe source, whom the BBC said was “familiar with the firings”, said the code created an alert as to which employee names were being removed or deactivated.\n\nPinterest has been investing heavily in AI to create more personalised content for its users and automated tools for marketers. But shares in the company have dropped by more than 20% this year as investors assess the threat from more advanced AI platforms.\n\nReady said in a company-wide meeting that while “healthy debate and dissent are expected, that’s how we make our decisions”, according to CNBC, which first reported the news.\n\nThe chief executive said Pinterest was facing a “critical moment” and that staff should consider a job elsewhere if they were “working against the direction of the company” and disagreed with its mission, CNBC reported.\n\nIt comes amid a wave of job cuts in the techy sector, as businesses increasingly rely on AI. Last week, Amazon announced it would cut 16,000 roles worldwide, its second round of redundancies in three months.\n\nMeta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said it would cut more than 1,000 jobs from its Reality Labs division to redirect resources to AI wearables and phone features. Meanwhile, Autodesk, a design software maker, announced plans this month to cut about 1,000 jobs.",

    "description": "Amazon's week included a White House screening of the \"Melania\" documentary and another massive round of layoffs.",
    "fullText": "It was a turbulent week for Amazon.\n\nFrom a bungled email prematurely announcing another massive round of layoffs to scrutiny around the company's $75 million investment in a documentary about the first lady, Amazon heads into its quarterly earnings report next week surrounded by a deafening level of outside noise.\n\nOn Saturday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and a top entertainment exec from the company joined a group of CEOs, politicians and celebrities at the White House for a private screening of \"Melania,\" which was produced by Amazon MGM Studios and Melania Trump.\n\nThe event was roundly criticized for appearing tone deaf as it occurred mere hours after federal immigration agents shot and killed urgent care nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, the second such deadly incident there in less than three weeks.\n\nWhile most of the biggest names in tech stayed mum on the matter, many people in the industry expressed outrage over the incidents, and urged other members of the tech community to publicly denounce the killing of Pretti and the prior shooting of Renee Good, as well as President Donald Trump's immigration policies.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, who attended the screening, subsequently issued a statement calling for a \"deescalation\" after the recent violence but without mentioning the two fatal shootings. Amazon hasn't commented on the matter.\n\nAmazon's ties to the Melania film, which officially hit theatres on Friday, was awkward enough given the political tensions building in Minneapolis and elsewhere. The price tag has raised further questions about Amazon's agenda and whether the company is trying to curry favor with the president.\n\n\"I'm not involved in that. That was done with my wife,\" President Trump told reporters on Thursday at a premier for the movie in Washington, D.C.. \"I think it's a very important movie. I think it's really going to be very important. It shows life in the White House. It's a big deal, actually.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Amazon MGM said in an email, \"We licensed the film for one reason and one reason only — because we think customers are going to love it.\"\n\nEarly ticket sales for the documentary have been weak, and the film is projected to bring in about $5 million during its opening weekend in the U.S. and Canada, Puck News reported, citing National Research Group forecasting data.\n\nMaking the timing even worse for Amazon, which has also agreed to stream a three-part docuseries through Prime Video, the company on Wednesday initiated another round of mass layoffs impacting about 16,000 corporate workers. The company let go of 14,000 employees last October.\n\nThe announcement was preempted a day early by an inadvertent email sent to cloud employees, which alluded to \"organizational changes,\" and a post from Amazon's human resources boss Beth Galetti.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a broader effort by Jassy to cut costs and \"remove bureaucracy\" at the company, while it pushes to invest heavily in artificial intelligence. Some employees previously told CNBC that the cost cuts and rolling layoffs have damaged morale.\n\nIn a Reddit forum for Amazon employees, some users questioned the rationale of the company's money-saving efforts alongside its investment in \"Melania.\"\n\n\"With $75 million we could have given each laid off employee about $4,500,\" wrote one user. \"But instead we spent it on the ridiculous Melania movie. Ashamed to work at Amazon.\"\n\nAnalysts at Citizens said this week that they expect Amazon's 30,000 job cuts to generate up to $8 billion of cost savings in 2026.\n\nIn a segment for \"The Daily Show\" that aired Thursday, host Desi Lydic called it a \"cash grab,\" and criticized Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and former CEO.\n\n\"Why would Jeff Bezos, a billionaire who has tons of business with the government, run by a famously corrupt president known for loving bribes, overpay for a Melania documentary?,\" Lydic said. \"Hmm, let me think.\"\n\nAnd filmmaker Julie Cohen, who previously worked with Amazon on documentaries, told The New York Times that the Melania price tag was abnormal and suggests the company \"is buying something else for their money.\"\n\nAfter he was repeatedly attacked by Trump in his first term, Bezos has cozied up to the president this time around. He's dined with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence, and he attended the inauguration a year ago. Amazon, meanwhile, donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund and helped pay for Trump's $300 million ballroom renovation.\n\nThere was even more drama in the broader Bezos universe this week after multiple outlets reported that the Washington Post, which Bezos has owned since 2013, is preparing broad layoffs across the newsroom, with the sports, local and international sections expected to be impacted.\n\nThe newspaper's White House team wrote a letter to Bezos, describing the importance of the work of those teams and telling their boss that they need \"collaboration with all corners of the newsroom.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results, wrapping up earnings season for the tech giants (though Nvidia reports later in the month).\n\nAmazon is expected to report revenue growth of about 13% to $211.3 billion, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG. The expansion is being driven by Amazon Web Services and digital advertising, which are both projected to show growth of around 22%, based on data from FactSet.\n\nAnalysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets upped their price target on the stock this week and kept their buy recommendation, in part due to an acceleration at AWS, boosted by a recent deal with OpenAI. Amazon is now in talks to invest up to $50 billion in OpenAI, CNBC confirmed this week.\n\nAs Amazon races to keep pace with rivals in AI, the company is boosting spending on data centers. In the earnings report, capital expenditures are likely to show an increase of 24% from a year earlier to almost $34.5 billion, according to LSEG.\n\nThe KeyBanc analysts said that while those rising costs will weigh on profitability, \"we believe Amazon will continue looking across the organization for further efficiencies to minimize the potential margin impact.\"\n\nWATCH: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on the 'unprecedented' demand for AI compute",

    "description": "How Amazon's decision translates to your own workplace.",
    "fullText": "16,000 jobs down. How many more to go?\n\nThe sequel to Amazon's mass layoffs last fall came yesterday with another round of deep job cuts. I'd love to tell you it's an isolated incident, but it feels representative of a broader shift across tech and corporate America.\n\nAI is ushering in a new era for workplaces, and companies are adjusting accordingly. As the ones closest to the tech (and spending the most on it), Big Tech would be the first to evolve. Make no mistake: Where Big Tech goes, the rest of the business world will likely follow.\n\nSo what can we glean from Amazon's layoffs? Fortunately, my colleagues Eugene Kim and Ashley Stewart are crushing it with scoops. Their stories provide context about Amazon's decision and how that translates to your own workplace.\n\nNo one is safe: Internal Slack messages Ashley viewed show how many teams were bitten by the layoff bug. That includes businesses within AWS (its AI cloud service and cloud data warehouse service) and Amazon's retail business.\n\nOne Amazon worker used an AI tool to flag roles on the chopping block. That list is even broader, although it may contain inaccuracies since it's AI-generated. Another noticeable trend is how software engineers got hit particularly hard, as has been the case in tech recently.\n\nOwn it: After a not-so-hot start, Amazon has coordinated its post-layoffs communications. And there's one word that keeps cropping up: ownership.\n\nPrasad Kalyanaraman, VP of AWS Infrastructure, and Colleen Aubrey, SVP of Applied AI Solutions, both described \"doubling down on a culture of ownership\" in memos Ashley viewed. That sentiment, coupled with the changes Eugene reported on in performance reviews, signals that the further away you are from doing the actual work, the more at risk you are.\n\nAI can be a friend as much as a foe: Artificial intelligence often takes a lot of blame for why jobs are getting swallowed up. A memo from AWS VP Greg Pearson that Eugene viewed paints a different picture.\n\nHe urged workers to \"keep finding ways to use technology to simplify our work.\" It's something I heard a lot of last week when chatting with execs: \"AI won't take your job, but the person willing to use it will.\"\n\nMake change, don't manage it: I'm not a tech career coach (I'll leave that advice to this guy), but the layoffs, coupled with CEO Andy Jassy's ongoing war against bureaucracy, indicate a desire to get more people rolling up their sleeves.\n\nIt's reminiscent of a recent convo I had with Cisco president and chief product officer Jeetu Patel. He stressed the importance of figuring out the change you want to make and working toward it, rather than focusing on a job title.\n\n\"If in the pursuit of that change, you have to go out and reluctantly manage some people, then go ahead and do that,\" Patel told me. \"But management, in and of itself, is not a full-time job.\"",

    "fullText": "New year, new layoffs — and Big Tech workers who spent their careers being courted by recruiters are in for a nasty reality.\n\nOn Wednesday, Amazon said it would cut around 16,000 corporate jobs globally. It's the second round of layoffs since October, when the company eliminated 14,000 roles. Earlier this month, Meta cut about 1,500 employees in its Reality Labs division.\n\nJanuary is historically a common month for companies to shed workers as they reassess budgets and plan for the year ahead. January 2024 saw more than 34,000 tech layoffs across 123 companies, according to the online tracker Layoffs.fyi — a monthly total that hasn't been exceeded since.\n\nHowever, tech workers don't typically face a job market this challenging. US businesses are hiring at one of the lowest rates since 2013, and tech job postings have plunged amid economic uncertainty and the early effects of AI adoption.\n\nOver the past year, I've spoken with dozens of laid-off workers — including people from Big Tech companies like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. Many told me they'd built their careers in a tech landscape where job security could be elusive, but opportunities were plentiful. Some said finding a new role used to be as simple as opening LinkedIn and replying to the recruiters who regularly flooded their inboxes.\n\nNow, despite impressive résumés and big-name credentials, many laid-off tech workers are struggling to land their next roles.\n\nLast year, US tech companies announced roughly 154,000 layoffs, per Challenger, 15% more than in 2024 and the most of any private-sector industry. Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Tesla each announced plans in recent years to cut at least 10,000 employees.\n\nThis adds up to too many workers flooding the market and not enough jobs. It's affected people like James Hwang, who has struggled to find work since being laid off from his IT support engineering role at Amazon in October. Although his résumé sports years of experience at Amazon, he said it's not as helpful as one might think.\n\n\"It felt like there was this huge brick wall from the get-go,\" said Hwang, who's 28 and lives in Michigan. \"I applied to 100 jobs but didn't get any interviews.\"\n\nWorkers in Hwang's line of work have had abundant job opportunities in years past, but now tech companies are getting leaner and expecting more. They're rightsizing after overhiring during the pandemic, taking longer to fill roles, and citing a need to be more efficient in the AI age. At the same time, the US has seen a decline in tech openings, down 33% on Indeed from early 2020 levels as of December.\n\n\"It feels like recruiters are looking for Superman,\" said Mody Khan, who has been looking for work since losing his Microsoft job in December 2024. He said he's depleted much of his savings and fears he could lose his home.\n\nDespite a five-year run at Microsoft, he said, even landing interviews has been difficult. Among the many challenges he's faced during his job search, Khan said, is that some companies he's interviewed with have seemed to favor candidates with startup backgrounds — making his time at a large tech firm feel like a disadvantage in those cases.\n\nTech workers who've experienced layoffs throughout their careers consistently pointed to one challenge that stands out in today's market: the sheer level of competition.\n\nSriram Ramkrishna was laid off from Intel for a second time last July and has been looking for work ever since. He said he has a clearer sense of his career identity than after his first layoff in 2016, but that the job market is more competitive than anything he's ever experienced.\n\n\"If an employer I'm interested in posts a job, there's bound to be at least 400 applicants,\" said Ramkrishna, who's in his 50s and lives in Portland, Oregon.\n\nWhile most laid-off workers I've spoken with have faced more challenging job searches than they expected, others have eventually found work.\n\nWhen Deborah Henderson was laid off from Microsoft after 14 years, she shared the news on LinkedIn and helped start a Discord group for other affected colleagues. She said connecting with others provided emotional support and helped surface new job opportunities — including a referral for a role at Meta that she landed just two months after being laid off.\n\n\"It's so helpful to have the support of other people who are going through it — both the highs and the lows,\" said Hendersen, who's in her 40s and lives in Seattle.\n\nMike Kostersitz, on the other hand, struggled to find a new role after 31 years at Microsoft. He felt like a fish out of water in the job market, so he decided to hire a career coach to help him build a résumé, update his LinkedIn profile, draft cover letters, and tailor his materials for applicant tracking systems.\n\nIn particular, he added, it was difficult to know which parts of his Microsoft experience to highlight in interviews.\n\n\"It's like, I have 30 years of stories for you. Which one do you want to hear?\" said Kostersitz, who's in his 60s and lives in Washington state.\n\nKostersitz said he eventually expanded his search to tech roles at large corporations outside Big Tech. After six months, he landed a role at Nike.\n\nHis top piece of advice for job seekers is something he first heard from a career advisor provided through Microsoft's layoff package: develop a solid job search strategy — and stick with it.\n\n\"They said it's a game of chicken right now. The person who has the longer breath and can stick it out longer will get the job.\"",

Although the company initially linked the October layoffs to AI, CEO Andy Jassy later said they were driven more by cultural fit than by cost reductions or automation.\n\nJassy has previously said AI will ultimately reduce Amazon's workforce by driving efficiency gains. On Wednesday, Amazon's chief human resources officer, Beth Galetti, said in the layoff announcement that the company will continue hiring and investing in \"strategic areas.\"\n\nWednesday's layoff was Amazon's second round of mass job cuts since October, when it axed 14,000 roles.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "The layoffs mark the second round of mass cuts at Amazon since last October, when the company laid off roughly 14,000 employees across its corporate workforce.",
    "fullText": "Amazon said Wednesday it plans to eliminate about 16,000 corporate jobs, marking its second round of mass job cuts since last October.\n\nIn a blog post, the company wrote that the layoffs were part of an ongoing effort to \"strengthen our organization by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy.\" That coincides with a push to invest heavily in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe cuts come just a few months after October's layoffs, when 14,000 employees were let go across Amazon's corporate workforce. At the time, the company indicated the cuts would continue in 2026 as it found \"additional places we can remove layers.\"\n\nBeth Galetti, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, didn't rule out more job cuts in the future, but said the company isn't trying to create \"a new rhythm\" of broad layoffs every few months.\n\n\"That's not our plan,\" Galetti wrote. \"But just as we always have, every team will continue to evaluate the ownership, speed, and capacity to invent for customers, and make adjustments as appropriate.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, some employees in Amazon's cloud unit received an email sent in an apparent error acknowledging \"organizational changes\" at the company. The note referenced a post from Galetti and said Amazon notified \"impacted colleagues in our organization.\"\n\nAmazon had about 1.58 million employees as of the end of its third quarter. That figure is primarily made up of warehouse and logistics workers.\n\nThe 30,000 job cuts since October represent about 10% of its corporate and tech workforce, which comprises about 350,000 people.\n\nAmazon has been in the midst of a significant downsizing for the past several years. The company laid off more than 27,000 employees between 2022 and 2023, and it conducted smaller cuts across various organizations in 2024.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy has looked to slim down Amazon's workforce after the company went on a hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic, partly to meet a surge in demand for e-commerce and cloud computing services.\n\nJassy has also looked to reset Amazon's corporate culture so that it can operate like the \"world's largest startup.\" He set internal targets to slash management layers and established a \"no bureaucracy email alias\" to identify ways the company can innovate faster.\n\nAmazon has also been cutting costs across its business so that it can invest \n\nLast October, Amazon said it expects capital expenditures to reach $125 billion for 2026, the highest spending forecast among the megacap companies.\n\nJassy said last June that efficiency gains from AI would likely cause Amazon's corporate headcount to fall in the coming years.\n\n\"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,\" Jassy said at the time.",

    "description": "The invitation was written by Amazon executive Colleen Aubrey. It was cancelled soon after being sent, stoking confusion among some employees.",
    "fullText": "Some Amazon employees got a worrying calendar invitation on Tuesday, stoking more concern about job cuts that are expected in coming days.\n\nThe invitation addressed impending job cuts and mentioned \"Project Dawn,\" an initiative to improve efficiency at Amazon, according to a copy obtained by Business Insider.\n\nThe invitation had the subject line \"Send Project Dawn email\" and was written by Colleen Aubrey, senior vice president of AWS Solutions, although it appears to have been sent by an assistant.\n\nThe invitation was for a calendar event at 5 a.m. Pacific time on Wednesday, but it was canceled shortly after it was sent. Some employees noticed it and shared the information with Business Insider.\n\n\"This is a continuation of the work we've been doing for more than a year to strengthen the company by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy, so that we can move faster for customers,\" the accompanying message read. \"The notifications to impacted colleagues in our organization who are based in the US, Canada, and Costa Rica have now been completed.\"\n\n\"Changes like this are hard on everyone,\" Aubrey's message continued. \"These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success.\"\n\nAmazon plans to cut thousands of corporate roles in coming days, Business Insider previously reported. The reductions would mark the company's second round of mass layoffs since October, when it eliminated roughly 14,000 jobs. An Amazon spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAfter the calendar invitation landed, confusion spread across an internal Slack channel with more than 36,000 Amazon employees, according to messages viewed by Business Insider. Staff questioned whether the message had been intended for Aubrey's entire organization or only for those whose roles were being eliminated.\n\n\"Am I impacted or sent by mistake to all?\" one employee wrote.\n\nOthers saw the email as confirmation that the expected layoffs were imminent.\n\n\"Well, if you needed solid proof that tomorrow is legit, the project dawn email is it,\" one person wrote. \"Looks like they wanted to use AI to send an email tomorrow and instead it sent a calendar invite today.\"\n\nIt remains unclear which teams will be affected by the cuts. Some Amazon employees who spoke to Business Insider theorized that staff who received the accidental invitation may not be among those getting cut.\n\n\"People are speculating you're safe if invited,\" one employee said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Lululemon has laid off 100 part-time employees in its customer service department in an effort to \"strengthen\" the business.\n\nThe layoffs have affected staff in North America working at the company's contact center.\n\nA Lululemon company spokesperson said: \"Over the past several months and as part of our ongoing strategic efforts to strengthen our business, we have been assessing ways to optimize and better support this experience for our guests and employees in North America.\n\n\"After careful consideration, we have made the decision to transition our North America GEC to a full-time employee staffing model. As a result, approximately 100 part-time positions in our GEC have been impacted,\" they said.\n\nThe company has come under pressure in recent months. Its sales in the Americas have slid, and analysts say the brand has veered from its yoga roots and become more generic. Its stock price has sunk 53% in the past year.\n\nIt previously cut around 150 corporate staff last summer.\n\nChip Wilson, the founder of Lululemon, has also become increasingly vocal in his criticism of the athleisure company.\n\nAt the end of last year, he launched a proxy battle to change the leadership of Lululemon's board.\n\nWilson weighed in again last week, when the brand briefly halted online sales of its \"Get Low\" leggings after customers complained they were see-through. Wilson described this as a \"total operational failure,\" and the fault of the company's board.\n\nLululemon's current CEO, Calvin McDonald, will step down at the end of this month. His permanent replacement has yet to be announced.\n\nDo you work for Lululemon and have a tip or story to share? Contact this reporter via email at rshahidi@insider.com.",

Schulman warned that widespread layoffs are inevitable as AI rapidly automates both entry-level and professional roles, while Smith argued that AI can serve as a powerful tool to help employees continuously upskill and stay competitive. The exchange highlights a central leadership challenge: how to harness AI’s productivity and protect your people.",

    "fullText": "I’ve been a games journalist since 2007, but still there isn’t much video games coverage that feels like it’s specifically for people like me. So I’m creating a home for it: Mothership\n\nWhether you’re reading about the impending AI bubble bursting or about the video game industry’s mass layoffs and cancelled projects, 2026 does not feel like a hopeful time for gaming. What’s more, games journalists – as well as all other kinds of journalists – have been losing their jobs at alarming rates, making it difficult to adequately cover these crises. Donald Trump’s White House, meanwhile, is using video game memes as ICE recruitment tools, and game studios are backing away from diversity and inclusion initiatives in response to the wider world’s slide to the right.\n\nThe manosphere is back, and we’ve lost mainstream feminist websites such as Teen Vogue; bigots everywhere are celebrating what they see as the death of “woke”. Put it all together and we have a dismal stew of doom for someone like me, a queer woman and a feminist who’s been a games journalist and critic since 2007.\n\nEverything I just listed off in that paragraph speaks to an urgent need for something different. This is why I’m launching a gender and identity-focused gaming publication called Mothership. It’s independent and worker-owned; it will rely on subscribers’ support to exist. Mothership will focus on reporting on the good and bad of modern-day game-making – alongside investigations, reviews, criticism, and historical deep dives into games and developers who paved the way to now. It will be a website for people who read the news with dread, including gaming news, and worry that Gamergaters got what they always wanted. And it will be a place for readers who wish there was something like a Teen Vogue, but for games (and without a corporate owner to kneecap it).\n\nAfter all, the last two decades have seen a lot of actual, valuable change, and modern games are evidence of that. We exist, now, in a gaming world with more female characters, more non-binary characters, more queer characters, and more characters who don’t fall into rigidly defined gender stereotypes. The GDC State of the Game Industry survey for 2025 found that 66% of surveyed game developers were male, compared with 75% in 2020, and 94% in 2009.\n\nMore people than ever can now see themselves reflected in game characters, and more diverse development teams are creating them. But change has not come easy – and we’ve seen a lot of backlash to this progress. Few websites still in existence are able to cover this backlash while also keeping their reporters safe and motivated to continue.\n\nI have dreamed of founding a website like this for a long time; it’s not as if readers haven’t wanted it before now. The problem I saw with the idea was not that people wouldn’t want it, but rather that I didn’t see a good way to pay for it. Journalism has been facing a monetisation crisis since the advent of the internet. It’s hard to convince readers to pay for something they are used to getting for free.\n\nBut I know the readers are there. In the mid-2010s, I worked for a small “geek girl” feminist website called the Mary Sue, and it was a unique pleasure to write very specific articles for a very specific audience. The Mary Sue relied on advertising income, which meant that all of us had to write up to six articles every weekday; there wasn’t time to spend on investigative reporting, for example, or long-form critical essays. I’m still proud of what we achieved, despite the intensity of those working conditions, not to mention the amount of harassment we faced just for existing. But I always dreamed of working for a place that had the same editorial remit without the harsh working conditions and quotas.\n\nLater, I left the Mary Sue and went on to work for Kotaku and then Polygon, both huge games websites where I was writing for broader audiences, rather than the hyper-specific one we catered to at the Mary Sue. As I watched many smaller games websites crumble over the course of the 2010s and 20s, I figured this was the only type of games website that was going to survive. The idea of working for a small, feminist games website – my dream – increasingly looked like an impossible speck of starlight in a far-off galaxy.\n\nBut then, in the summer of 2025, my then-employer Polygon underwent a mass layoff and acquisition. We went from a staff of 42 people to just eight. After a particularly disheartening video call with our website’s new owners, I realised I was going to have to quit. Every piece of the dream felt well and truly dead. I had not got into journalism to be taken advantage of by people who saw me and my colleagues as so easily replaceable as to be barely human.\n\nAnother one of my colleagues at Polygon – Zoe Hannah, games editor – quit as well, for similar reasons. She hit me up with an idea she had for a feminist games website. “You should do it,” I told her. And then I sat there for a moment and thought about it. No, we should do it! This was what I had wanted to do, before the industry had transformed me into someone so gnarled and jaded that I no longer believed it was even possible.\n\nSix months on, after many DMs with former colleagues from Polygon, the Mary Sue and Kotaku, plus other notable writers who’ve covered gender and identity in games – Zoe and I are launching Mothership together, today. We have had the benefit of advice and inspiration from many other independent, worker-owned outlets that have come before us, such as Defector, the Flytrap, and Aftermath. Already, we’ve surpassed 1,200 paid subscribers. (I knew the readers were there.) And we don’t need millions of them. Mothership is a publication for a very specific audience: the people who don’t fit the mould of the masculine, hardcore gamer image that marketing and pop culture have been dishing out since the 90s. We want to serve this audience well.\n\nI believe our website is a necessity in our current political climate. It should have existed before, when I and millions of other girls who grew up playing games were made to feel out of place by media and advertising that was laser-focused on teenage boys. But it’s not too late for me to make sure it exists now.",

    "description": "Amazon employees respond to expected layoffs and corporate job cuts by posting memes referencing  founder Jeff Bezos' two-pizza rule.",
    "fullText": "Amazon employees are doing what Big Tech workers often do when they're anxious about layoffs: making memes.\n\nThe company is expected to cut thousands more corporate roles as soon as next week, Business Insider reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. This coming round would mark another wave of mass layoffs at Amazon in just a few months, following the roughly 14,000 jobs eliminated in October.\n\nIn the absence of official companywide communication, workers have been trying to ease tension in an internal Slack channel with more than 26,000 employees who joined by posting memes and jokes, which Business Insider viewed.\n\nThe focus of their snark? Amazon founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos' famous \"two-pizza rule,\" originally designed to keep meetings lean and productive. The rule was simple: never have a meeting so large that two pizzas couldn't feed the entire group.\n\nAs the company continues to thin its ranks, employees are using the same logic to point out just how much leaner their teams are about to become.\n\nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nOne meme showed a single, thin sliver of pizza with the caption \"how we feed two pizza teams.\"\n\nAnother image featured two Amazon Web Services-branded pizza boxes, with the caption \"did someone say 2 pizza team?\" The meme is a nod to the company's cloud division, where many of the cuts are expected to land.\n\n\"I don't think I've ever been on a team that could be completely fed with just two reasonably sized pizzas until you were still hungry very frugal,\" one employee wrote in the Slack channel. \"Increasing 'span-of-control' for managers seems to be the new rage.\"\n\nOthers wondered if two Costco pizzas would be considered \"reasonably sized.\"\n\n\"I was thinking more like Domino's Large pizzas,\" another employee wrote.\n\nThe pizza jokes weren't the only coping mechanism. Employees also shared non-pizza memes.\n\nOne riffed on the rumored timing, splashing \"JANUARY 27TH\" over the scene from \"The Shining\" showing Jack Nicholson's character smashing through a door with an ax and \"AWS\" over his face.\n\nAnother meme used the \"panik/kalm\" template to mock corporate buzzwords. It shows an error message about email not working, presumably because the employee was laid off, with the words \"Mail not working (have I become Nimble?!)\", referring to CEO Andy Jassy's 2025 remarks about cutting jobs to stay nimble.\n\nOther posts leaned into the dread of the unknown: one meme laid out a checklist for employees for January 27: \"able to login,\" \"mail and Slack works,\" and \"no random HR meeting in calendar.\"\n\nAnother simply captured the vibe in all caps: \"I don't know what will happen on 27 Jan and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.\"\n\nAmazon isn't the first tech giant to see a nervous workforce poke fun at its internal culture. In 2023, Google employees flooded the company's internal message boards with memes mocking its lavish developer conference, which came months after it laid off 12,000 employees.\n\nHave a tip?
