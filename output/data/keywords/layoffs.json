    "fullText": "Amazon is planning to eliminate thousands of corporate employees, with cuts expected to begin as soon as next week, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe reductions would mark the company's second wave of mass layoffs since October, when Amazon cut about 14,000 jobs. Two of the people said the company is expected to eliminate a similar number of roles in the coming round, bringing total job cuts to almost 30,000.\n\nThe latest cuts underscore Amazon's continued efforts to streamline operations and reset its culture.\n\nAmazon first attributed the October job cuts to changes brought on by AI. But CEO Andy Jassy later said the layoffs were instead tied to cultural fit, not cost savings or AI.\n\nAmazon employs more than 1.5 million people globally, though its corporate workforce makes up a relatively small share, at about 350,000.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHave a tip?
