    "fullText": "Amazon on Wednesday said it's cutting 16,000 corporate roles, the company's second round of layoffs in four months.\n\nEmployees in the US, UK, and India have been receiving notifications about the cuts, according to internal Slack posts viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe messages suggest impacted teams include those within the company's Amazon Web Services cloud unit, such as the AI cloud service Bedrock, the cloud data warehouse service Redshift, and the ProServe consulting team, as well as retail business teams such as the Prime subscription service and the last-mile Delivery Experience team.\n\nMany of the affected employees who posted to an internal Amazon Slack channel seeking job leads had software engineering roles.\n\nAmazon said it's offering \"most\" US-based employees 90 days to search for a new role internally. Those who are unable to find a role or opt not to find a new position will receive support, including severance and health insurance benefits.\n\nThis round of layoffs is the latest mass job cut since October, when Amazon shed 14,000 roles. Amazon employs more than 1.5 million people globally, though its corporate workforce represents a relatively small share of that total, at roughly 350,000 employees.\n\nA calendar invite sent on behalf of one of the company's most senior executives yesterday appeared to have accidentally leaked details about the layoff plans.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Amazon is cutting 16,000 corporate roles, and an internal FAQ viewed by Business Insider spells out the details for affected employees.\n\nThis round of layoffs is the second mass job cut since October, when Amazon shed 14,000 roles. The moves are part of a broad effort by the company to operate more efficiently amid rapid advances in AI. Amazon didn't respond to requests for further comments on the job cuts.\n\nEmployees who received a layoff notification will receive full pay and benefits for 90 days plus an additional severance package, and are no longer expected to perform any work, according to the document.\n\nAmazon's public announcement stated that the company is offering most US-based employees 90 days to search for a new role internally.

    "description": "The layoffs mark the second round of mass cuts at Amazon since last October, when the company laid off roughly 14,000 employees across its corporate workforce.",
    "fullText": "Amazon said Wednesday it plans to eliminate about 16,000 corporate jobs, marking its second round of mass job cuts since last October.\n\nIn a blog post, the company wrote that the layoffs were part of an ongoing effort to \"strengthen our organization by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy.\" That coincides with a push to invest heavily in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe cuts come just a few months after October's layoffs, when 14,000 employees were let go across Amazon's corporate workforce. At the time, the company indicated the cuts would continue in 2026 as it found \"additional places we can remove layers.\"\n\nBeth Galetti, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, didn't rule out more job cuts in the future, but said the company isn't trying to create \"a new rhythm\" of broad layoffs every few months.\n\n\"That's not our plan,\" Galetti wrote. \"But just as we always have, every team will continue to evaluate the ownership, speed, and capacity to invent for customers, and make adjustments as appropriate.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, some employees in Amazon's cloud unit received an email sent in an apparent error acknowledging \"organizational changes\" at the company. The note referenced a post from Galetti and said Amazon notified \"impacted colleagues in our organization.\"\n\nAmazon had about 1.58 million employees as of the end of its third quarter. That figure is primarily made up of warehouse and logistics workers.\n\nThe 30,000 job cuts since October represent about 10% of its corporate and tech workforce, which comprises about 350,000 people.\n\nAmazon has been in the midst of a significant downsizing for the past several years. The company laid off more than 27,000 employees between 2022 and 2023, and it conducted smaller cuts across various organizations in 2024.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy has looked to slim down Amazon's workforce after the company went on a hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic, partly to meet a surge in demand for e-commerce and cloud computing services.\n\nJassy has also looked to reset Amazon's corporate culture so that it can operate like the \"world's largest startup.\" He set internal targets to slash management layers and established a \"no bureaucracy email alias\" to identify ways the company can innovate faster.\n\nAmazon has also been cutting costs across its business so that it can invest \n\nLast October, Amazon said it expects capital expenditures to reach $125 billion for 2026, the highest spending forecast among the megacap companies.\n\nJassy said last June that efficiency gains from AI would likely cause Amazon's corporate headcount to fall in the coming years.\n\n\"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,\" Jassy said at the time.",

    "description": "The invitation was written by Amazon executive Colleen Aubrey. It was cancelled soon after being sent, stoking confusion among some employees.",
    "fullText": "Some Amazon employees got a worrying calendar invitation on Tuesday, stoking more concern about job cuts that are expected in coming days.\n\nThe invitation addressed impending job cuts and mentioned \"Project Dawn,\" an initiative to improve efficiency at Amazon, according to a copy obtained by Business Insider.\n\nThe invitation had the subject line \"Send Project Dawn email\" and was written by Colleen Aubrey, senior vice president of AWS Solutions, although it appears to have been sent by an assistant.\n\nThe invitation was for a calendar event at 5 a.m. Pacific time on Wednesday, but it was canceled shortly after it was sent. Some employees noticed it and shared the information with Business Insider.\n\n\"This is a continuation of the work we've been doing for more than a year to strengthen the company by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy, so that we can move faster for customers,\" the accompanying message read. \"The notifications to impacted colleagues in our organization who are based in the US, Canada, and Costa Rica have now been completed.\"\n\n\"Changes like this are hard on everyone,\" Aubrey's message continued. \"These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success.\"\n\nAmazon plans to cut thousands of corporate roles in coming days, Business Insider previously reported. The reductions would mark the company's second round of mass layoffs since October, when it eliminated roughly 14,000 jobs. An Amazon spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAfter the calendar invitation landed, confusion spread across an internal Slack channel with more than 36,000 Amazon employees, according to messages viewed by Business Insider. Staff questioned whether the message had been intended for Aubrey's entire organization or only for those whose roles were being eliminated.\n\n\"Am I impacted or sent by mistake to all?\" one employee wrote.\n\nOthers saw the email as confirmation that the expected layoffs were imminent.\n\n\"Well, if you needed solid proof that tomorrow is legit, the project dawn email is it,\" one person wrote. \"Looks like they wanted to use AI to send an email tomorrow and instead it sent a calendar invite today.\"\n\nIt remains unclear which teams will be affected by the cuts. Some Amazon employees who spoke to Business Insider theorized that staff who received the accidental invitation may not be among those getting cut.\n\n\"People are speculating you're safe if invited,\" one employee said.\n\nHave a tip?

As a result, approximately 100 part-time positions in our GEC have been impacted,\" they said.\n\nThe company has come under pressure in recent months. Its sales in the Americas have slid, and analysts say the brand has veered from its yoga roots and become more generic. Its stock price has sunk 53% in the past year.\n\nIt previously cut around 150 corporate staff last summer.\n\nChip Wilson, the founder of Lululemon, has also become increasingly vocal in his criticism of the athleisure company.\n\nAt the end of last year, he launched a proxy battle to change the leadership of Lululemon's board.\n\nWilson weighed in again last week, when the brand briefly halted online sales of its \"Get Low\" leggings after customers complained they were see-through. Wilson described this as a \"total operational failure,\" and the fault of the company's board.\n\nLululemon's current CEO, Calvin McDonald, will step down at the end of this month.

    "fullText": "I’ve been a games journalist since 2007, but still there isn’t much video games coverage that feels like it’s specifically for people like me. So I’m creating a home for it: Mothership\n\nWhether you’re reading about the impending AI bubble bursting or about the video game industry’s mass layoffs and cancelled projects, 2026 does not feel like a hopeful time for gaming. What’s more, games journalists – as well as all other kinds of journalists – have been losing their jobs at alarming rates, making it difficult to adequately cover these crises. Donald Trump’s White House, meanwhile, is using video game memes as ICE recruitment tools, and game studios are backing away from diversity and inclusion initiatives in response to the wider world’s slide to the right.\n\nThe manosphere is back, and we’ve lost mainstream feminist websites such as Teen Vogue; bigots everywhere are celebrating what they see as the death of “woke”. Put it all together and we have a dismal stew of doom for someone like me, a queer woman and a feminist who’s been a games journalist and critic since 2007.\n\nEverything I just listed off in that paragraph speaks to an urgent need for something different. This is why I’m launching a gender and identity-focused gaming publication called Mothership. It’s independent and worker-owned; it will rely on subscribers’ support to exist. Mothership will focus on reporting on the good and bad of modern-day game-making – alongside investigations, reviews, criticism, and historical deep dives into games and developers who paved the way to now. It will be a website for people who read the news with dread, including gaming news, and worry that Gamergaters got what they always wanted. And it will be a place for readers who wish there was something like a Teen Vogue, but for games (and without a corporate owner to kneecap it).\n\nAfter all, the last two decades have seen a lot of actual, valuable change, and modern games are evidence of that. We exist, now, in a gaming world with more female characters, more non-binary characters, more queer characters, and more characters who don’t fall into rigidly defined gender stereotypes. The GDC State of the Game Industry survey for 2025 found that 66% of surveyed game developers were male, compared with 75% in 2020, and 94% in 2009.\n\nMore people than ever can now see themselves reflected in game characters, and more diverse development teams are creating them. But change has not come easy – and we’ve seen a lot of backlash to this progress. Few websites still in existence are able to cover this backlash while also keeping their reporters safe and motivated to continue.\n\nI have dreamed of founding a website like this for a long time; it’s not as if readers haven’t wanted it before now. The problem I saw with the idea was not that people wouldn’t want it, but rather that I didn’t see a good way to pay for it. Journalism has been facing a monetisation crisis since the advent of the internet. It’s hard to convince readers to pay for something they are used to getting for free.\n\nBut I know the readers are there. In the mid-2010s, I worked for a small “geek girl” feminist website called the Mary Sue, and it was a unique pleasure to write very specific articles for a very specific audience. The Mary Sue relied on advertising income, which meant that all of us had to write up to six articles every weekday; there wasn’t time to spend on investigative reporting, for example, or long-form critical essays. I’m still proud of what we achieved, despite the intensity of those working conditions, not to mention the amount of harassment we faced just for existing. But I always dreamed of working for a place that had the same editorial remit without the harsh working conditions and quotas.\n\nLater, I left the Mary Sue and went on to work for Kotaku and then Polygon, both huge games websites where I was writing for broader audiences, rather than the hyper-specific one we catered to at the Mary Sue. As I watched many smaller games websites crumble over the course of the 2010s and 20s, I figured this was the only type of games website that was going to survive. The idea of working for a small, feminist games website – my dream – increasingly looked like an impossible speck of starlight in a far-off galaxy.\n\nBut then, in the summer of 2025, my then-employer Polygon underwent a mass layoff and acquisition. We went from a staff of 42 people to just eight. After a particularly disheartening video call with our website’s new owners, I realised I was going to have to quit. Every piece of the dream felt well and truly dead. I had not got into journalism to be taken advantage of by people who saw me and my colleagues as so easily replaceable as to be barely human.\n\nAnother one of my colleagues at Polygon – Zoe Hannah, games editor – quit as well, for similar reasons. She hit me up with an idea she had for a feminist games website. “You should do it,” I told her. And then I sat there for a moment and thought about it. No, we should do it! This was what I had wanted to do, before the industry had transformed me into someone so gnarled and jaded that I no longer believed it was even possible.\n\nSix months on, after many DMs with former colleagues from Polygon, the Mary Sue and Kotaku, plus other notable writers who’ve covered gender and identity in games – Zoe and I are launching Mothership together, today. We have had the benefit of advice and inspiration from many other independent, worker-owned outlets that have come before us, such as Defector, the Flytrap, and Aftermath. Already, we’ve surpassed 1,200 paid subscribers. (I knew the readers were there.) And we don’t need millions of them. Mothership is a publication for a very specific audience: the people who don’t fit the mould of the masculine, hardcore gamer image that marketing and pop culture have been dishing out since the 90s. We want to serve this audience well.\n\nI believe our website is a necessity in our current political climate. It should have existed before, when I and millions of other girls who grew up playing games were made to feel out of place by media and advertising that was laser-focused on teenage boys. But it’s not too late for me to make sure it exists now.",

    "description": "Amazon employees respond to expected layoffs and corporate job cuts by posting memes referencing  founder Jeff Bezos' two-pizza rule.",
    "fullText": "Amazon employees are doing what Big Tech workers often do when they're anxious about layoffs: making memes.\n\nThe company is expected to cut thousands more corporate roles as soon as next week, Business Insider reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. This coming round would mark another wave of mass layoffs at Amazon in just a few months, following the roughly 14,000 jobs eliminated in October.\n\nIn the absence of official companywide communication, workers have been trying to ease tension in an internal Slack channel with more than 26,000 employees who joined by posting memes and jokes, which Business Insider viewed.\n\nThe focus of their snark? Amazon founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos' famous \"two-pizza rule,\" originally designed to keep meetings lean and productive. The rule was simple: never have a meeting so large that two pizzas couldn't feed the entire group.\n\nAs the company continues to thin its ranks, employees are using the same logic to point out just how much leaner their teams are about to become.\n\nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nOne meme showed a single, thin sliver of pizza with the caption \"how we feed two pizza teams.\"\n\nAnother image featured two Amazon Web Services-branded pizza boxes, with the caption \"did someone say 2 pizza team?\" The meme is a nod to the company's cloud division, where many of the cuts are expected to land.\n\n\"I don't think I've ever been on a team that could be completely fed with just two reasonably sized pizzas until you were still hungry very frugal,\" one employee wrote in the Slack channel. \"Increasing 'span-of-control' for managers seems to be the new rage.\"\n\nOthers wondered if two Costco pizzas would be considered \"reasonably sized.\"\n\n\"I was thinking more like Domino's Large pizzas,\" another employee wrote.\n\nThe pizza jokes weren't the only coping mechanism. Employees also shared non-pizza memes.\n\nOne riffed on the rumored timing, splashing \"JANUARY 27TH\" over the scene from \"The Shining\" showing Jack Nicholson's character smashing through a door with an ax and \"AWS\" over his face.\n\nAnother meme used the \"panik/kalm\" template to mock corporate buzzwords. It shows an error message about email not working, presumably because the employee was laid off, with the words \"Mail not working (have I become Nimble?!)\", referring to CEO Andy Jassy's 2025 remarks about cutting jobs to stay nimble.\n\nOther posts leaned into the dread of the unknown: one meme laid out a checklist for employees for January 27: \"able to login,\" \"mail and Slack works,\" and \"no random HR meeting in calendar.\"\n\nAnother simply captured the vibe in all caps: \"I don't know what will happen on 27 Jan and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.\"\n\nAmazon isn't the first tech giant to see a nervous workforce poke fun at its internal culture. In 2023, Google employees flooded the company's internal message boards with memes mocking its lavish developer conference, which came months after it laid off 12,000 employees.\n\nHave a tip?
