    "description": "The AI surge is lifting companies in the semiconductor supply chain — including a toilet maker and a seasoning giant.",
    "fullText": "The AI boom isn't just lifting chipmakers and Big Tech. In Japan, it's flushing gains into a toilet manufacturer and a seasoning giant.\n\nAs demand for AI chips surges, investors are piling into companies that sit inside the semiconductor supply chain — even if they're better known for bathrooms and soup stock.\n\nToilet maker Toto, famous for its high-tech bidets and heated seats, has drawn investor attention. The company makes electrostatic chucks, which are critical components used in the production of NAND memory chips.\n\nMemory prices have climbed sharply in recent months, driven by AI-related demand.\n\nLast week, UK-based activist fund Palliser Capital called Toto \"the most undervalued and overlooked AI memory beneficiary,\" according to reports by Bloomberg and the Financial Times.\n\nAfter news broke on Tuesday that Palliser Capital had taken a stake and was pushing Toto to promote its chip-parts business, the toilet maker's stock jumped more than 5%. Its shares are up more than 54% over the past year.\n\nIt's not just Toto. Japanese food giant Ajinomoto, better known for its umami seasonings and soup bases, has become an unlikely AI infrastructure play. The company produces an insulating material used in advanced semiconductor packaging.\n\nAjinomoto's latest financials point to strength beyond its core food business. For the nine months ended December, the company reported an 8.9% rise in net profit, while operating profit increased 5.6% year-on-year. The gains were partly driven by its \"Healthcare and Others\" segment which includes electronic materials used in semiconductors, the company said in a February earnings statement.\n\nAfter Ajinomoto posted its earnings on February 5, the company's stock rose 13%. Its shares are up more than 56% over the past year.\n\nNot all non-tech companies are benefiting equally from the AI boom. Daikin, best known globally for its air conditioners, supplies high-purity chemical materials used in semiconductor manufacturing. It recently trimmed its outlook, citing uncertainty over US tariffs as a drag on demand.\n\nThe Japanese air conditioning maker reduced its operating profit forecast by about 5% to 413 billion Japanese yen, or $2.6 billion, for the fiscal year ending in March.\n\n\"Operating profit was significantly affected by the decline in semiconductor demand, decreasing by 44.6% year over year to ¥18,102 million,\" the company said in its financial report in February.\n\n\"Net sales of fluoropolymers fell year over year, despite focused Group efforts to capture strong new demand in the data center field, and was due to the stagnation in the construction markets of the United States and China and the significant overall impact of delays in the recovery of semiconductor demand,\" it added.\n\nThe company said it plans to cushion the blow through price increases and cost reductions.\n\nDaikin's stock dropped as much as 8.4% in Tokyo following its financial results.",

    "fullText": "Kentucky Republican Representative Thomas Massie named the Emirati businessman Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem as the individual Jeffrey Epstein had emailed about a \"torture video\".\n\nSulayem is chairman and CEO of DP World, a major global logistics firm based in the UAE. Newsweek has contacted DP World's media office via email for comment.\n\nThe emails were released by the Department of Justice in the Epstein files, but one sender's name was redacted. Lawmakers have been able to view the unredacted files.\n\nEpstein sent an email on April 24, 2009, that said: \"where are you? are you ok , I loved the torture video\"\n\nThe recipient's email address and name were redacted.\n\nBut Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the recipient was identified in the file EFTA00666117, which names \"Sultan Bin Sulayem\" while redacting the email address.\n\nThe nature of the \"torture video\" is not known.\n\nThey replied a day later to say: \"I am in china I will be in the US 2nd week of may\"\n\nSulayem was a friend of Epstein's, and the DOJ documents show that the pair corresponded about sexual experiences.\n\nThe Emirati businessman continued a relationship with disgraced financier Epstein for years after the latter's conviction for soliciting an underage prostitute in 2008.\n\nAppearing in the Epstein files is not indicative of criminal wrongdoing.\n\nMassie, who spearheaded the congressional push to secure the full release of the Epstein files, had said of the \"torture video\" email chain in a post on X: \"A Sultan seems to have sent this. DOJ should make this public.\"\n\nBlanche replied, also on X: \"You looked at the document. You know it’s an email address that was redacted. The law requires redactions for personally identifiable information, including if in an email address. And you know that the Sultan’s name is available unredacted in the files. See EFTA00666117. Be honest, and stop grandstanding.\"\n\nUnder the Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed by Congress in November, the DOJ was ordered to release all of the documents in its possession relating to Epstein, with only limited redactions permitted.\n\nThe Department has so far released around 3.5 million files concerning Epstein.\n\nOn Monday, Maryland Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin, who is the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, said the DOJ has withheld a further “three million documents.”\n\nRaskin was one of several members of Congress granted access to view unredacted copies of the Epstein files at an office in Washington, D.C.\n\n“I went over there and I was able to determine, at least I believe, that there were tons of completely unnecessary redactions in addition to the failure to redact the names of victims,” Raskin told reporters on Monday.\n\nThe Democrat added that he and other members of Congress had been given only four computers to review the files, and that he had only been able to see between 30 and 40 on Monday.\n\nIn a polarized era, the center is dismissed as bland. At Newsweek, ours is different: The Courageous Center—it's not \"both sides,\" it's sharp, challenging and alive with ideas. We follow facts, not factions. If that sounds like the kind of journalism you want to see thrive, we need you.\n\nWhen you become a Newsweek Member, you support a mission to keep the center strong and vibrant. Members enjoy: Ad-free browsing, exclusive content and editor conversations. Help keep the center courageous.

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Intel and AMD have notified Chinese customers of supply shortages for server central processing units (CPUs), with Intel warning of delivery lead times of up to six months, people with knowledge of the delays said.\n\nThe supply ​constraints have driven up prices for Intel's server products in China by more than 10% generally, although pricing varies by ‌customer contract, according to one of the people.\n\nBooming investment in artificial intelligence infrastructure has created a frantic rush not only for AI-specific chips, but also other parts of ‌the supply chain - most acutely in memory chips, prices of which continue to soar.\n\nThese latest notices to Chinese customers, which the sources said were made in recent weeks, indicate that CPU shortages have also intensified. That could compound challenges for AI companies as well as many other manufacturers.\n\nIn China, which accounts for more than 20% of Intel's overall revenue, its fourth- and fifth-generation Xeon CPUs are in particularly short supply, ⁠with Intel rationing deliveries, two of the people ‌said.\n\nIntel has a substantial backlog of unfulfilled orders for these models, with delivery times extending as long as six months, they added.\n\nAMD has also informed clients of supply constraints, said one of the people and a ‍third source. Delivery lead times for some AMD products have been pushed out to eight to 10 weeks, the third source said.\n\nThe extent of the supply contraints in China is being reported by Reuters for the first time.\n\nIntel, which flagged CPU supply constraints in its earnings call in January, said in a ​statement to Reuters that the rapid adoption of AI had led to strong demand for \"traditional compute\".\n\nThe company expects \"inventory at lowest level in ‌Q1, but we are addressing aggressively and expect supply improvement in Q2 through 2026,\" the statement said.\n\nAMD reiterated remarks in its earnings call that it has boosted its supply capabilities to cope with strong demand.\n\n\"We remain confident in our ability to meet customer demand globally based on our strong supplier agreements and supply chain, including our partnership with TSMC,\" it said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nThe two companies together dominate the global server CPU market. Intel has seen its market share decline from over 90% in 2019 to about ⁠60% in 2025, while AMD's share has climbed from around 5% in 2019 ​to more than 20% last year, according to a UBS report in January.",

    "description": "When my parents decided to go to Europe for the first time, I volunteered to join them. I helped with logistics and loved seeing their excitement.",
    "fullText": "If I'd told my parents 10 years ago that they'd have the opportunity to stand on top of a mountain in the Swiss Alps, they wouldn't have believed me.\n\nFor most of their lives, they operated a small family dairy farm in rural Wisconsin and were tied to its constant responsibilities. Because of this, their vacations were limited.\n\nSo, last year, when I learned my parents were ready to book their first trip to Europe to celebrate their 31st wedding anniversary, I was beyond excited.\n\nIt would be their first time crossing the Atlantic, their first long overnight flight, and their first taste of navigating customs and large international airports.\n\nHaving traveled throughout Europe before, I didn't hesitate to volunteer to go along to ensure everything went well.\n\nWhat I didn't expect, though, was how much this trip would help me reconnect with them.\n\nMy first task was researching tour options, comparing guided tour companies and self-guided itineraries, and figuring out which travel style would make them feel most comfortable.\n\nEventually, we settled on a 10-day guided group tour through Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein, and the Czech Republic, so there'd be a balance of structure and free time to explore on our own and relax.\n\nWhen we landed in Zurich, I talked my parents through customs step by step, answered their questions, and reassured them as they navigated unfamiliar signs and procedures.\n\nMoments like this made me feel useful, knowing that simply explaining the process helped make the experience smoother for them.\n\nThe trip was also an incredible opportunity to see Europe through their eyes. While we were exploring Lucerne, Switzerland, it became clear that my dad had taken on the role of unofficial trip photographer. He'd stop whenever something caught his eye to zoom, adjust, and zoom again until the shot felt just right.\n\nAt first, his frequent pauses frustrated me, leaving us trailing behind the group, but as the trip went on, I found the habit more endearing than annoying.\n\nLater that day, we ascended Mount Pilatus, taking in sweeping views of the alpine landscape below. As we descended the mountain on a gondola, my mom pointed out the small farmsteads below, while my dad took it all in.\n\nWatching their expressions, which were filled with awe and joy, was one of the most memorable moments of the trip.\n\nThroughout my travels, I've seen many mountain views, but witnessing their reaction to the Alps made the scenery feel extra special and gave me a newfound appreciation for my travels.\n\nAnother highlight of the trip was celebrating my parents' wedding anniversary at Neuschwanstein Castle in Germany.\n\nWe spent much of the day traveling by bus through the countryside, watching cows graze in green pastures and taking in the views of rolling hills.\n\nFor my parents, scenes like these felt both familiar and different at the same time, and spending the day with them reminded me of all they had worked for.\n\nThroughout the trip, my parents leaned on me for small things like converting currencies and making sure we were in the right place at the right time.\n\nEach time they told me they were glad I was there, I was struck by how rare it felt to be genuinely needed by my parents.\n\nBefore we left, I thought I was just tagging along to help them. I didn't realize how much I'd gain from the experience, too.\n\nFor my parents, this trip was a dream finally come true. For me, it was a chance to rediscover not only the beauty of Europe but also the beauty of watching the people you love experience the world for the first time.\n\nThey reminded me of the joy of firsts — the first glimpse of the Alps, the first taste of Wiener Schnitzel, the first feeling of stepping into a new country — and for that, I'm grateful.\n\nTraveling with my parents as an adult was a wonderful experience. Although I had to adjust to their pace and roll with their quirks, the memories we made together were worth every bit of effort in the end.",

    "description": "NGC2 analyzes supply and maintenance needs, getting fixes to soldiers faster. The software also simulates how enemy attacks could influence logistics.",
    "fullText": "A new combat tool is helping the US Army predict what ammo, fuel, and supplies it'll need by gaming out how enemies might attack.\n\nThe change is speeding up and breaking down barriers within the logistics chain, with real-time data helping troops, commanders, and sustainment planners predict what's needed so that they don't get left waiting around for days only to find they're facing a critical supply shortage.\n\nLogistics is a central focus of the Army's broader push to modernize how it fights and sustains forces, and the effort is unfolding through the Next Generation Command and Control system, or NGC2. The system is being built through a series of exercises and tests, with each iteration pulling in more weapons, vehicles, sensors, and data streams to expand what it can do.\n\nAt an exercise happening right now at Fort Carson, Colorado, the Army and a team of industry partners, including Anduril, are expanding NGC2 to make supply chain data more accessible and predictive when it comes to what soldiers need to fight.\n\nWith the NGC2 software, \"it's no longer, 'Hey, operations, what is your next 24-hour plan or what's your next 48-hour plan?'\"James Craven, the NGC2 program director at Anduril, said at a media roundtable on Tuesday.\n\nInstead, operational plans are able to be quickly shaped off of logistics data and commander guidance and then stress-tested against simulated enemy actions.\n\nThose simulations allow planners to examine multiple scenarios, showing how demand for ammunition, fuel, maintenance, or medical support could change depending on what an adversary does. The longer-term aim, Craven said, is to make the system accessible across the service and to key partners, allowing suppliers to estimate future demand earlier.\n\nWith NGC2, \"we can see magazine depth, consumption rates, and how those change over time, in real time,\" Craven said, and then that data can be analyzed thanks to artificial intelligence and machine learning to estimate the downstream effects on operations.\n\nThe Army says that the data-driven model is meant to replace its largely reactive supply system, where sustainment units often respond only after shortages appear. It's a dynamic that, as Army logistics leader Lt. Gen. Michelle Donahue recently warned, can delay support and leave front-line units short.\n\nThe software also tracks the status of equipment, vehicles, and weapons, using that data to predict maintenance needs and potential failures. The idea is to flag issues before systems break down, allowing maintenance crews to intervene earlier and reduce operational disruptions.\n\nAs the Army and its defense industry partners have been building the NGC2 system, they've been incorporating soldier feedback for quick fixes, sometimes implementing them overnight or within days. Service officials have said it's a major change from the past, where feedback became real change months or years later.\n\nTom Keane, Anduril's senior vice president and head of the connected warfare division, said on Tuesday that in general, new or upgraded capabilities are provided at least weekly, sometimes daily or hourly, depending on what's being worked on.\n\nNGC2 is a key example of how the Army is prioritizing agile, adaptive weapons development and the adoption of a Silicon Valley-style of work that's faster and more software-based than how the service has typically done business. The command and control system also represents a different relationship between the Army and its industry partners that the service says has led to a more iterative design approach.",
