    "fullText": "Pete Hegseth has threatened to cancel $200m contract unless it is given unfettered access to Claude model\n\nAnthropic said Thursday it “cannot in good conscience” comply with a demand from the Pentagon to remove safety precautions from its artificial intelligence model and grant the US military unfettered access to its AI capabilities.\n\nThe Department of Defense had threatened to cancel a $200m contract and deem Anthropic a “supply chain risk”, a designation with serious financial implications, if the company did not comply with the request by Friday.\n\nChief executive Dario Amodei said in a statement that the threats from the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, would not change the company’s position, and that he hoped Hegseth would “reconsider”.\n\n“Our strong preference is to continue to serve the Department and our warfighters – with our two requested safeguards in place,” he said. “We remain ready to continue our work to support the national security of the United States.”\n\nAt the core of the Department of Defense and Anthropic’s standoff is a disagreement over how the AI company will permit its product, Claude, to be used. The Pentagon has demanded that Anthropic turn off safety guardrails and allow any lawful use of Claude, while Anthropic has pushed back against allowing Claude to be used for mass domestic surveillance or in autonomous weapons systems that can kill people without human input.\n\nAfter months of dispute and pressure from the government, Hegseth reportedly gave Amodei until Friday evening to agree to the Pentagon’s demands or face punitive action.\n\nWhether Anthropic would concede was seen as a high-profile test of its claim to be the most safety-conscious of the major AI firms, as well as whether any part of the AI industry would push back against government desires to use the technology for controversial, potentially lethal purposes.\n\nIn his statement, Amodei said using AI for autonomous weapons and mass domestic surveillance is “simply outside the bounds of what today’s technology can safely and reliably do”.\n\nThe Department of Defense has handed a number of lucrative deals to tech firms in recent years for the companies to build or integrate AI technology into US military systems. In July of last year, Anthropic was one of several big tech companies including Google and OpenAI to receive up to $200m contracts with the DoD. What set Anthropic apart, and has intensified its conflict with the Pentagon, is that until this week it was the only AI model that had been approved for use in the military’s classified systems. (Elon Musk’s xAI reached an agreement earlier this week to also be used in classified systems.)\n\nAnthropic’s technology has reportedly already been used for military applications, including the US capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro last month, highlighting the growing use of AI in conflict. The growth of autonomous weapons technology, such as drones that can carry out operations even after their connection to a human operator has been severed, has also intensified longstanding concerns around how AI will be used in life-and-death situations.\n\nAnthropic and Amodei have long been some of the industry’s most prominent advocates for regulation and safety precautions in developing AI, even as they have struck deals with the military and this week watered down a core policy to not release new AI models without first guaranteeing their safety. Amodei’s calls for regulation, and history of political opposition to Donald Trump, have run up against Hegseth’s vows to remove “wokeness” from the armed forces and pursue aggressive military policies.\n\nIf Hegseth follows through with his threat to categorize Anthropic as a supply chain risk, it would be a huge blow to the AI company. The designation, which is more commonly intended to be used for foreign adversaries, would prohibit other vendors that do business with the US military from using Anthropic’s products.",

    "title": "GitHub Actions is left vulnerable to supply chain attacks: Datadog Report",
    "description": "For our 2026 State of DevSecOps report, we analyzed data from thousands of cloud environments to assess trends in application security posture and adoption of DevSecOps best practices.",
    "fullText": "Eighty-seven percent of organizations have at least one exploitable vulnerability, affecting 40% of all services. These vulnerabilities remain most prevalent in Java services at 59%, with .NET at 47% and Rust at 40%. Where vulnerabilities are known to be actively exploited, there’s an increased chance that vulnerable services will be compromised.\n\nKeeping languages and runtime environments up to date is a primary way to prevent exploitable vulnerabilities in applications and services, and it also makes it more likely that dependencies will stay up to date. Once an application falls several versions behind, upgrading to the latest release requires significantly more time, money, and effort, which often causes work to be deferred and ultimately leaves the application running on an end-of-life (EOL) version.\n\nGlobally, we found that 10% of services are based on at least one EOL version of a language or runtime environment. Java is in the middle of the pack at 10% of services using an EOL version, with Go at 23% and PHP at 13%.\n\nDigging deeper, we found that the aggressiveness of a language’s EOL approach may be an influence. For instance, Go takes an aggressive approach with its EOL policy, which is likely causing the spike compared to other languages; a Go version is supported for one year, while PHP versions are supported for four years. When an organization is using an EOL version of a language or runtime environment, 50% of the services in that language have an exploitable vulnerability compared to 37% when there are no EOL versions used.\n\nModern applications rely on many third-party dependencies, each with its own update cadence and breaking-change risks. Our research found that the median dependency is 278 days behind its latest major version, compared to 215 days behind last year. Java and Ruby were the two languages above the median at 492 days behind and 357 days behind, respectively.\n\nDependencies in services that are deployed less than once per month are 70% more outdated than those deployed daily, with a median of 295 days compared to 172 days behind their latest version update. This highlights how deployment frequency is both a productivity metric and a meaningful security control. By evaluating library upgrades with DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics, we see that greater development velocity and stability correlate with a stronger overall security posture than services with lower DORA metrics.\n\nAs mentioned in Fact 1, up-to-date services and dependencies are less likely to have vulnerabilities. This year, we looked at the age of dependencies in relation to the number of vulnerabilities and found that newer libraries have a lower number of discovered vulnerabilities. Broken down by service, libraries published in 2025 have, on average, 1.3 vulnerabilities, compared to 1.9 in 2024 and 3.8 in 2023. The spike in 2023 can largely be attributed to six Spring Framework and Spring Boot CVEs affecting Java services. The prevalence of Java vulnerabilities aligns with our earlier observation that Java dependencies are typically the most outdated.\n\nWhile our scope for this year’s report included only services using Datadog Software Composition Analysis, there was little change year over year in the percentage of services using libraries that are not actively maintained and contain known vulnerabilities. This suggests that companies are still not prioritizing them, potentially due to feature velocity and the growing backlog of vulnerabilities. Security vulnerabilities, deprecations, and supply chain issues can emerge quickly and stack up, making it difficult for teams to track which updates are urgent.\n\nLibrary vulnerabilities are concerning because they can be discovered in any version at any time. That’s why regularly updating libraries often reduces the likelihood of breaking changes and makes future updates easier to successfully complete. Regression testing is key when updating any library, especially when making a big version jump. To start, increasing testing coverage of an application can improve confidence that there were not breaking changes or could be used to identify where an issue occurred.\n\nAutomatically updating software to a new release may seem like an easy way to keep libraries up to date and avoid the risks discussed in Facts 1 and 2. However, when factoring in supply chain compromises, updating to a new version within a day of release can have a negative impact on the overall security of an application due to the potential to unknowingly install malicious software.\n\nTo better identify this risk, our research shows that 50% of organizations are using third-party libraries within a day of release, along with 12% using public AMIs and 32% using public Docker images less than one day after release. Despite lower rates of use within a day of release, AMIs and Docker images pose a higher potential impact if compromised due to their broad system-level access when compared to libraries.\n\nOver the past year, we have seen the spread of several large-scale supply chain attacks, most notably s1ngularity and both Shai-Hulud attacks, due in part to organizations using malicious versions of libraries as soon as they’re released. To keep dependencies safe from malware, we recommend pinning dependency versions to a full-length commit SHA. If that’s not possible, Yarn and pnpm—two alternative JavaScript package managers—have a new configuration for minimum release age to allow time for new versions to be used by others. GitHub’s Dependabot has the ability to add a “cooldown” time for the same reason. This buffer method keeps packages up to date but gives a set time before installation to reduce the likelihood of malicious software. A cooldown of one week could prevent a majority of malicious dependencies from taking root.\n\nFocusing even further, 54% of organizations using JavaScript and 55% of organizations using Python used a new library version less than one day after release. We noted that 1.6% of organizations using npm have used at least one malicious dependency in the past year. This is significant at npm’s scale; it represents potentially tens of thousands of organizations that executed malicious code, demonstrating that supply chain attacks are an operational reality if proper security measures are not in place.\n\nIn early 2025, Datadog released research on a cloud image name confusion attack affecting AWS Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). We found that blindly retrieving the most recently created AMI without specifying an owner could lead to malicious AMIs unknowingly being used. Investigating this further, 12% of organizations have used at least one AMI within one day after its creation.\n\nIn response to this research, AWS created a new “Allowed AMIs” feature that can help prevent these attacks, which is recommended if you use a community AMI. If you’re looking to see who in your organization has used unverified community AMIs, whoAMI-scanner is an open source tool that will create a report for you. Investigator.cloud is another useful resource to explore public AMIs and their lineage.\n\nLibraries and AMIs are not the only software that is used immediately after release. In fact, 32% of organizations have used a public Docker image within one day of its creation, which is also a security risk. Docker containers are not a new attack vector, but the recent research surrounding library and AMI attacks has overshadowed the malicious container images seen in the past.\n\nWhenever possible, ensure that container images are coming from trusted first-party sources, such as using the “Trusted Content” tags in Docker Hub (e.g., Docker Official Images, Verified Creators, and Sponsored OSS) to reduce the risk of using a malicious image. If you aren’t able to use an image from a first-party trusted source, consider allowing a cooldown period to give researchers time to investigate along with doing your own analysis. Nothing is foolproof, but these options can help reduce the risk associated with using a public image.\n\nThis past year, we have seen an increase in large-scale supply chain attacks that used GitHub Actions in a variety of ways to gain initial access to repositories and exfiltrate data that affects both custom and marketplace GitHub actions. The changed-files action by tj-actions was compromised, and attackers inserted a malicious payload that caused affected public repositories to write secrets to workflow logs.\n\nFor this report, we are defining marketplace actions as publicly available actions on GitHub’s Marketplace. While GitHub Actions vulnerabilities have remained relatively consistent, we’ve found that every organization using GitHub Actions uses at least one marketplace action, but only 4% of organizations pin the hash for all marketplace actions. Additionally, 71% of organizations never pin the hash for any of their actions. This is risky because GitHub states that pinning an action to a full-length commit SHA is the only way to prevent automatic updates, as discussed in Fact 3.\n\nDigging deeper, we found that 80% of organizations use at least one marketplace action not managed by GitHub and not pinned to a commit hash. This may reflect limited awareness of the guidance and the added inconvenience of needing to update the YAML file.\n\nTwo percent of organizations that use GitHub Actions are running at least one action that has been compromised in the past and is not pinned to a commit hash. With the growing frequency of compromised actions, this figure is expected to increase year over year unless adoption of commit pinning actions improves.\n\n“GitHub Actions workflows routinely handle production credentials, generate release builds, and execute third-party code in highly privileged contexts, yet most organizations don't secure them with the same rigor they apply to production infrastructure. The major GitHub Actions compromises of 2025 made clear that attackers are systematically targeting this gap. Organizations need a first-principles approach to CI/CD security: Understanding the blast radius of every workflow, monitoring runtime behavior, and treating build infrastructure as a high-value asset. That foundational thinking is what enabled early detection of attacks like tj-actions, Shai-Hulud, and s1ngularity, and it's what the industry needs to adopt broadly in 2026.”\n\nCritical vulnerabilities should be quickly fixed, but only when they are truly critical. Vulnerability severity—typically measured by its CVSS base score—is the starting point but can be adjusted when taking runtime context and CVE context into account. Our research shows that only 18% of critical dependency vulnerabilities stay critical after adjusting the severity score, the same as last year. Truly critical vulnerabilities are reduced by more than 80%, substantially decreasing alert volume.\n\nThis year, we wanted to dig further and understand how this differs across languages. We found that 98% of .NET dependency vulnerabilities are downgraded from critical. After further investigation, the average Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) score for a .NET vulnerability is much lower than that of other languages, likely due in part to the built-in security features, like Code Access Security, that reduce exploit probability. On the higher end of the spectrum, 49% of PHP dependency vulnerabilities remain critical. This may be due to the high public exploit availability and high exploitation probability of many PHP dependency vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Datadog severity score that is used to adjust the initial CVSS score is based on four factors. For the runtime context, it considers whether the vulnerability is in production and whether the affected service is under active attack. The two additional factors are derived from CVE context: the availability of an exploit and the likelihood of exploitation.\n\nOver-prioritizing every critical vulnerability can overwhelm teams, creating alert fatigue and diverting attention from vulnerabilities that pose genuine business risk. Better prioritization allows teams to fix what matters most, which saves developers time and ultimately reduces costs.\n\nWe did notice that the average number of high or critical vulnerabilities per application that has at least one SCA vulnerability decreased to eight from 13.5 in 2025. This downward trend will be a key indicator for whether security prioritization is improving over the coming years.",

    "description": "The Blue UAS List vets commercial drones for security and supply chain risks. The program is one part of DoD's bet on drone warfare.",
    "fullText": "The US Department of Defense is rapidly embracing drones across the services and steering troops toward systems vetted to avoid Chinese supply chains.\n\nThe push reflects a broader Pentagon effort to field large numbers of low-cost drones quickly without creating new dependencies that could backfire in a fight.\n\nThe Blue UAS [Uncrewed Aerial Systems] List provides service branches and federal agencies with a catalog of approved drones they can buy.\n\nThe approval process focuses on cheaper, off-the-shelf UAS that the Pentagon can easily buy and upgrade. The criteria for the list align with the Pentagon's wider drone strategy, including the Drone Dominance Program, which is testing commercial platforms from 25 companies.\n\nThe Blue UAS program was established in 2020 to identify drones compliant with US government standards, particularly cybersecurity and supply-chain rules. In December 2025, the Defense Contract Management Agency launched an official Blue UAS List website cataloging the models that military personnel could use.\n\nThe DCMA said that the list would expedite the process of getting drones into troops' hands, help jump-start investments in UAS technologies in the drone industrial base, and spark reforms in DoD's acquisition processes.\n\nFifty-four drones have been cleared for training use, and 29 have passed additional reviews for operational deployment. Those selected drones include Shield AI's V-Bat, Skydio-made drones, Performance Drone Works' C100, and AeroEnvironment's Red Dragon.\n\nTo make the Blue UAS List, drones have to meet strict legal, cybersecurity, and operational requirements. Assessments are completed on whether the drones have any vulnerabilities, such as parts sourced from certain foreign countries or exposure to supply chain risks.\n\nA range of drones, drone parts, and software are part of the Blue UAS program. Many of the approved systems are tailored to specific missions but can be modified or upgraded as requirements evolve.\n\nOne of the biggest factors in creating this list was concerns over a Chinese-dominated drone market.\n\nAccording to the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International, Chinese companies control 90% of the commercial drone market. US officials have said the Blue UAS List is an effort to curb China's leverage over the market, including over key components such as motors that Beijing could restrict in a conflict, potentially disrupting US drone production.\n\nDespite the Blue UAS List's goal of compiling drones that aren't reliant on Chinese parts, sources told DefenseScoop last November that most of the approved drones rely on Chinese-made motors.\n\n\"While these Chinese-made motors are referred to as 'dumb components' experts say the issue is less about espionage risk and more about availability and resilience,\" a recent report from the Institute for Defense and Government Advancement said. \"In a conflict or trade disruption, US drone production could stall almost immediately due to reliance on Chinese supply chains.\"\n\nAmerican-made motors are typically more expensive, raising questions about how quickly Washington can scale domestic production and drive down costs.\n\nConcerns about China-free drones and the defense supply chain are more broadly sparking investments in a stronger American-made drone industry, which is an aspect of the Pentagon's Drone Dominance Program.\n\nWhen US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced the Pentagon's drone priorities in July 2025, he wrote that DoD would bolster US drone manufacturing, support investments in the domestic industry, and push for more low-cost drones and technological evolutions to get more drones to troops faster.\n\nDoD ultimately aims to field hundreds of thousands of low-cost, one-way attack drones by 2027. It has said it will invest more than $1 billion in the drone market over the next two years through the Drone Dominance Program.\n\nThe most recent development in the Drone Dominance Program is an initial test on one-way attack drones, which is happening now through next month at Fort Benning in Georgia.\n\nThe testing, called Gauntlet, involves drones from over two dozen companies, including a lot of smaller startups and two Ukrainian firms. When Gauntlet's done, DoD will buy roughly $150 million in prototypes of selected drones.\n\n\"While the Gauntlet is not itself a formal Blue UAS listing action, it is tightly aligned with the program's purpose and trajectory,\" the IDGA report said. It reflects DoD's shift toward iterative, competitive acquisition of new weapons that occur in months rather than years.",

    "description": "Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said that the \"whole supply chain\" for memory chips is constrained, which also impacts AI research.",
    "fullText": "The memory shortage takes no prisoners. Even Google isn't immune.\n\nAI companies are duking it out for greater and greater quantities of memory chips. The problem? The industry is heavily supply-constrained. Costs have skyrocketed, products have been tied up, and some companies — especially those in consumer electronics — are increasing prices.\n\nOn the AI front, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis told CNBC that physical challenges were \"constraining a lot of deployment.\" Google sees \"so much more demand\" for Gemini and its other models than it could serve, he said.\n\n\"Also, it does constrain a little bit the research,\" Hassabis said. \"You need a lot of chips to be able to experiment on new ideas at a big enough scale that you can actually see if they're going to work.\"\n\nResearchers want chips, whether they work at Google, Meta, OpenAI, or other Big Tech companies, and memory is a key component. Mark Zuckerberg said that AI researchers demanded two things beyond money: the fewest number of people reporting to them, and the most chips possible.\n\nHassabis said that wherever there was a capacity constraint, there was a \"choke point.\"\n\n\"The whole supply chain is kind of strained,\" Hassabis said. \"We're lucky, because we have our own TPUs, so we have our own chip designs.\"\n\nGoogle has long built TPUs — Tensor Processing Units — for internal use. The company also leases them to external customers through its cloud, which has also put Nvidia on edge.\n\nBut even access to their own TPUs won't save Google from having to navigate the highly competitive memory market. \"It still, in the end, actually comes down to a few suppliers of a few key components,\" Hassabis said.\n\nThree suppliers dominate memory chip production: Samsung, Micron, and SK Hynix. These companies are struggling to meet demand for chips from AI hyperscalers without dropping their longtime electronics customers.\n\nIt doesn't help that AI companies mainly want a different type of memory chip than PC manufacturers do. Large language model producers want HBM (high-bandwidth memory) chips.\n\nDon't expect Google's spending on AI infrastructure and chips to go down anytime soon. On its fourth-quarter earnings call, the company projected capital expenditures of $175 billion to $185 billion for 2026.",

    "description": "The AI surge is lifting companies in the semiconductor supply chain — including a toilet maker and a seasoning giant.",
    "fullText": "The AI boom isn't just lifting chipmakers and Big Tech. In Japan, it's flushing gains into a toilet manufacturer and a seasoning giant.\n\nAs demand for AI chips surges, investors are piling into companies that sit inside the semiconductor supply chain — even if they're better known for bathrooms and soup stock.\n\nToilet maker Toto, famous for its high-tech bidets and heated seats, has drawn investor attention. The company makes electrostatic chucks, which are critical components used in the production of NAND memory chips.\n\nMemory prices have climbed sharply in recent months, driven by AI-related demand.\n\nLast week, UK-based activist fund Palliser Capital called Toto \"the most undervalued and overlooked AI memory beneficiary,\" according to reports by Bloomberg and the Financial Times.\n\nAfter news broke on Tuesday that Palliser Capital had taken a stake and was pushing Toto to promote its chip-parts business, the toilet maker's stock jumped more than 5%. Its shares are up more than 54% over the past year.\n\nIt's not just Toto. Japanese food giant Ajinomoto, better known for its umami seasonings and soup bases, has become an unlikely AI infrastructure play. The company produces an insulating material used in advanced semiconductor packaging.\n\nAjinomoto's latest financials point to strength beyond its core food business. For the nine months ended December, the company reported an 8.9% rise in net profit, while operating profit increased 5.6% year-on-year. The gains were partly driven by its \"Healthcare and Others\" segment which includes electronic materials used in semiconductors, the company said in a February earnings statement.\n\nAfter Ajinomoto posted its earnings on February 5, the company's stock rose 13%. Its shares are up more than 56% over the past year.\n\nNot all non-tech companies are benefiting equally from the AI boom. Daikin, best known globally for its air conditioners, supplies high-purity chemical materials used in semiconductor manufacturing. It recently trimmed its outlook, citing uncertainty over US tariffs as a drag on demand.\n\nThe Japanese air conditioning maker reduced its operating profit forecast by about 5% to 413 billion Japanese yen, or $2.6 billion, for the fiscal year ending in March.\n\n\"Operating profit was significantly affected by the decline in semiconductor demand, decreasing by 44.6% year over year to ¥18,102 million,\" the company said in its financial report in February.\n\n\"Net sales of fluoropolymers fell year over year, despite focused Group efforts to capture strong new demand in the data center field, and was due to the stagnation in the construction markets of the United States and China and the significant overall impact of delays in the recovery of semiconductor demand,\" it added.\n\nThe company said it plans to cushion the blow through price increases and cost reductions.\n\nDaikin's stock dropped as much as 8.4% in Tokyo following its financial results.",

    "fullText": "Kentucky Republican Representative Thomas Massie named the Emirati businessman Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem as the individual Jeffrey Epstein had emailed about a \"torture video\".\n\nSulayem is chairman and CEO of DP World, a major global logistics firm based in the UAE. Newsweek has contacted DP World's media office via email for comment.\n\nThe emails were released by the Department of Justice in the Epstein files, but one sender's name was redacted. Lawmakers have been able to view the unredacted files.\n\nEpstein sent an email on April 24, 2009, that said: \"where are you? are you ok , I loved the torture video\"\n\nThe recipient's email address and name were redacted.\n\nBut Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the recipient was identified in the file EFTA00666117, which names \"Sultan Bin Sulayem\" while redacting the email address.\n\nThe nature of the \"torture video\" is not known.\n\nThey replied a day later to say: \"I am in china I will be in the US 2nd week of may\"\n\nSulayem was a friend of Epstein's, and the DOJ documents show that the pair corresponded about sexual experiences.\n\nThe Emirati businessman continued a relationship with disgraced financier Epstein for years after the latter's conviction for soliciting an underage prostitute in 2008.\n\nAppearing in the Epstein files is not indicative of criminal wrongdoing.\n\nMassie, who spearheaded the congressional push to secure the full release of the Epstein files, had said of the \"torture video\" email chain in a post on X: \"A Sultan seems to have sent this. DOJ should make this public.\"\n\nBlanche replied, also on X: \"You looked at the document. You know it’s an email address that was redacted. The law requires redactions for personally identifiable information, including if in an email address. And you know that the Sultan’s name is available unredacted in the files. See EFTA00666117. Be honest, and stop grandstanding.\"\n\nUnder the Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed by Congress in November, the DOJ was ordered to release all of the documents in its possession relating to Epstein, with only limited redactions permitted.\n\nThe Department has so far released around 3.5 million files concerning Epstein.\n\nOn Monday, Maryland Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin, who is the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, said the DOJ has withheld a further “three million documents.”\n\nRaskin was one of several members of Congress granted access to view unredacted copies of the Epstein files at an office in Washington, D.C.\n\n“I went over there and I was able to determine, at least I believe, that there were tons of completely unnecessary redactions in addition to the failure to redact the names of victims,” Raskin told reporters on Monday.\n\nThe Democrat added that he and other members of Congress had been given only four computers to review the files, and that he had only been able to see between 30 and 40 on Monday.\n\nIn a polarized era, the center is dismissed as bland. At Newsweek, ours is different: The Courageous Center—it's not \"both sides,\" it's sharp, challenging and alive with ideas. We follow facts, not factions. If that sounds like the kind of journalism you want to see thrive, we need you.\n\nWhen you become a Newsweek Member, you support a mission to keep the center strong and vibrant. Members enjoy: Ad-free browsing, exclusive content and editor conversations. Help keep the center courageous.

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Intel and AMD have notified Chinese customers of supply shortages for server central processing units (CPUs), with Intel warning of delivery lead times of up to six months, people with knowledge of the delays said.\n\nThe supply ​constraints have driven up prices for Intel's server products in China by more than 10% generally, although pricing varies by ‌customer contract, according to one of the people.\n\nBooming investment in artificial intelligence infrastructure has created a frantic rush not only for AI-specific chips, but also other parts of ‌the supply chain - most acutely in memory chips, prices of which continue to soar.\n\nThese latest notices to Chinese customers, which the sources said were made in recent weeks, indicate that CPU shortages have also intensified. That could compound challenges for AI companies as well as many other manufacturers.\n\nIn China, which accounts for more than 20% of Intel's overall revenue, its fourth- and fifth-generation Xeon CPUs are in particularly short supply, ⁠with Intel rationing deliveries, two of the people ‌said.\n\nIntel has a substantial backlog of unfulfilled orders for these models, with delivery times extending as long as six months, they added.\n\nAMD has also informed clients of supply constraints, said one of the people and a ‍third source. Delivery lead times for some AMD products have been pushed out to eight to 10 weeks, the third source said.\n\nThe extent of the supply contraints in China is being reported by Reuters for the first time.\n\nIntel, which flagged CPU supply constraints in its earnings call in January, said in a ​statement to Reuters that the rapid adoption of AI had led to strong demand for \"traditional compute\".\n\nThe company expects \"inventory at lowest level in ‌Q1, but we are addressing aggressively and expect supply improvement in Q2 through 2026,\" the statement said.\n\nAMD reiterated remarks in its earnings call that it has boosted its supply capabilities to cope with strong demand.\n\n\"We remain confident in our ability to meet customer demand globally based on our strong supplier agreements and supply chain, including our partnership with TSMC,\" it said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nThe two companies together dominate the global server CPU market. Intel has seen its market share decline from over 90% in 2019 to about ⁠60% in 2025, while AMD's share has climbed from around 5% in 2019 ​to more than 20% last year, according to a UBS report in January.",

    "description": "When my parents decided to go to Europe for the first time, I volunteered to join them. I helped with logistics and loved seeing their excitement.",
    "fullText": "If I'd told my parents 10 years ago that they'd have the opportunity to stand on top of a mountain in the Swiss Alps, they wouldn't have believed me.\n\nFor most of their lives, they operated a small family dairy farm in rural Wisconsin and were tied to its constant responsibilities. Because of this, their vacations were limited.\n\nSo, last year, when I learned my parents were ready to book their first trip to Europe to celebrate their 31st wedding anniversary, I was beyond excited.\n\nIt would be their first time crossing the Atlantic, their first long overnight flight, and their first taste of navigating customs and large international airports.\n\nHaving traveled throughout Europe before, I didn't hesitate to volunteer to go along to ensure everything went well.\n\nWhat I didn't expect, though, was how much this trip would help me reconnect with them.\n\nMy first task was researching tour options, comparing guided tour companies and self-guided itineraries, and figuring out which travel style would make them feel most comfortable.\n\nEventually, we settled on a 10-day guided group tour through Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein, and the Czech Republic, so there'd be a balance of structure and free time to explore on our own and relax.\n\nWhen we landed in Zurich, I talked my parents through customs step by step, answered their questions, and reassured them as they navigated unfamiliar signs and procedures.\n\nMoments like this made me feel useful, knowing that simply explaining the process helped make the experience smoother for them.\n\nThe trip was also an incredible opportunity to see Europe through their eyes. While we were exploring Lucerne, Switzerland, it became clear that my dad had taken on the role of unofficial trip photographer. He'd stop whenever something caught his eye to zoom, adjust, and zoom again until the shot felt just right.\n\nAt first, his frequent pauses frustrated me, leaving us trailing behind the group, but as the trip went on, I found the habit more endearing than annoying.\n\nLater that day, we ascended Mount Pilatus, taking in sweeping views of the alpine landscape below. As we descended the mountain on a gondola, my mom pointed out the small farmsteads below, while my dad took it all in.\n\nWatching their expressions, which were filled with awe and joy, was one of the most memorable moments of the trip.\n\nThroughout my travels, I've seen many mountain views, but witnessing their reaction to the Alps made the scenery feel extra special and gave me a newfound appreciation for my travels.\n\nAnother highlight of the trip was celebrating my parents' wedding anniversary at Neuschwanstein Castle in Germany.\n\nWe spent much of the day traveling by bus through the countryside, watching cows graze in green pastures and taking in the views of rolling hills.\n\nFor my parents, scenes like these felt both familiar and different at the same time, and spending the day with them reminded me of all they had worked for.\n\nThroughout the trip, my parents leaned on me for small things like converting currencies and making sure we were in the right place at the right time.\n\nEach time they told me they were glad I was there, I was struck by how rare it felt to be genuinely needed by my parents.\n\nBefore we left, I thought I was just tagging along to help them. I didn't realize how much I'd gain from the experience, too.\n\nFor my parents, this trip was a dream finally come true. For me, it was a chance to rediscover not only the beauty of Europe but also the beauty of watching the people you love experience the world for the first time.\n\nThey reminded me of the joy of firsts — the first glimpse of the Alps, the first taste of Wiener Schnitzel, the first feeling of stepping into a new country — and for that, I'm grateful.\n\nTraveling with my parents as an adult was a wonderful experience. Although I had to adjust to their pace and roll with their quirks, the memories we made together were worth every bit of effort in the end.",

    "description": "NGC2 analyzes supply and maintenance needs, getting fixes to soldiers faster. The software also simulates how enemy attacks could influence logistics.",
    "fullText": "A new combat tool is helping the US Army predict what ammo, fuel, and supplies it'll need by gaming out how enemies might attack.\n\nThe change is speeding up and breaking down barriers within the logistics chain, with real-time data helping troops, commanders, and sustainment planners predict what's needed so that they don't get left waiting around for days only to find they're facing a critical supply shortage.\n\nLogistics is a central focus of the Army's broader push to modernize how it fights and sustains forces, and the effort is unfolding through the Next Generation Command and Control system, or NGC2. The system is being built through a series of exercises and tests, with each iteration pulling in more weapons, vehicles, sensors, and data streams to expand what it can do.\n\nAt an exercise happening right now at Fort Carson, Colorado, the Army and a team of industry partners, including Anduril, are expanding NGC2 to make supply chain data more accessible and predictive when it comes to what soldiers need to fight.\n\nWith the NGC2 software, \"it's no longer, 'Hey, operations, what is your next 24-hour plan or what's your next 48-hour plan?'\"James Craven, the NGC2 program director at Anduril, said at a media roundtable on Tuesday.\n\nInstead, operational plans are able to be quickly shaped off of logistics data and commander guidance and then stress-tested against simulated enemy actions.\n\nThose simulations allow planners to examine multiple scenarios, showing how demand for ammunition, fuel, maintenance, or medical support could change depending on what an adversary does. The longer-term aim, Craven said, is to make the system accessible across the service and to key partners, allowing suppliers to estimate future demand earlier.\n\nWith NGC2, \"we can see magazine depth, consumption rates, and how those change over time, in real time,\" Craven said, and then that data can be analyzed thanks to artificial intelligence and machine learning to estimate the downstream effects on operations.\n\nThe Army says that the data-driven model is meant to replace its largely reactive supply system, where sustainment units often respond only after shortages appear. It's a dynamic that, as Army logistics leader Lt. Gen. Michelle Donahue recently warned, can delay support and leave front-line units short.\n\nThe software also tracks the status of equipment, vehicles, and weapons, using that data to predict maintenance needs and potential failures. The idea is to flag issues before systems break down, allowing maintenance crews to intervene earlier and reduce operational disruptions.\n\nAs the Army and its defense industry partners have been building the NGC2 system, they've been incorporating soldier feedback for quick fixes, sometimes implementing them overnight or within days. Service officials have said it's a major change from the past, where feedback became real change months or years later.\n\nTom Keane, Anduril's senior vice president and head of the connected warfare division, said on Tuesday that in general, new or upgraded capabilities are provided at least weekly, sometimes daily or hourly, depending on what's being worked on.\n\nNGC2 is a key example of how the Army is prioritizing agile, adaptive weapons development and the adoption of a Silicon Valley-style of work that's faster and more software-based than how the service has typically done business. The command and control system also represents a different relationship between the Army and its industry partners that the service says has led to a more iterative design approach.",
