    "fullText": "Which team suits Jeremiyah Love in this years upcoming NFL draft originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAs the 2026 NFL Draft approaches, one name rising quickly on scouts’ boards is Notre Dame’s dynamic running back, Jeremiyah Love. Considered a top prospect and projected as a potential first-round pick, Love is generating significant buzz due to his rare combination of size, speed, and versatility. Mock drafts frequently link him to teams like the New Orleans Saints, Kansas City Chiefs, and Minnesota Vikings, with other franchises such as the New York Giants, Jets, and Arizona Cardinals also reportedly interested.\n\nStanding out at 6-foot-1 and around 220 pounds, Love combines downhill power running with breakaway speed, making him a threat between the tackles and in the open field. His 2025 season was remarkable; he set Notre Dame’s single-season touchdown record, proving his ability to find the end zone with consistency.\n\nBut Love isn’t just a runner. He’s a polished receiver out of the backfield, frequently lining up as a wide option and showing great hands and route-running ability. This dual-threat skill set is essential in today’s NFL, where running backs must impact the passing game as much as the ground game. Love’s willingness and ability as a pass protector further increase his value, showing he can handle the complexities of NFL blocking schemes.\n\nOne of the teams most commonly associated with Love in mock drafts is the New Orleans Saints. The Saints have a strong quarterback in place and a talented receiving corps, including Chris Olave, but lack a true star running back. Love would bring a new dimension to their offense with his downhill running style and receiving skills. The Saints also need to bolster their offensive line, but Love’s versatility would allow them to maximize their existing weapons.\n\nSimilarly, the Kansas City Chiefs could be an ideal landing spot. Pairing Love with Patrick Mahomes would provide a dynamic, multi-dimensional offensive threat capable of creating mismatches against defenses. The Minnesota Vikings, looking to rejuvenate their backfield, also make sense given Love’s potential to be a long-term solution in their offense.\n\nThe debate about drafting running backs in the first round remains lively. While some analysts are cautious due to the importance of offensive line play, recent first-round backs like Bijan Robinson and Jahmyr Gibbs have proven how impactful the position can be with the right supporting cast. Saquon Barkley, another top-10 running back pick, demonstrated his full potential only after moving to Philadelphia, highlighting how situational fit is crucial.\n\nLove fits the mold of a first-round back who can immediately influence a team’s offensive identity. His combination of power, speed, and receiving ability offers a unique weapon that can change the way defenses prepare.\n\nUltimately, Jeremiyah Love is more than just a running back; he is a multi-faceted offensive weapon ready to make an immediate impact in the NFL. While some teams may hesitate to use a first-round pick on a running back due to positional value debates, Love’s talent and fit with teams in need could see him selected in the top 15 or even top 10.\n\nIf the Saints or Chiefs decide to prioritize offense in the early rounds, Love’s name will be among the first called a player who can bring explosiveness and versatility to an NFL offense hungry for game-changers. His draft stock continues to rise, and many believe he could redefine the value of the running back position in 2026.\n\nOregon's Dan Lanning rips College Football Playoff, calls for major changes\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nTop 2026 NFL Draft prospect suffers broken rib in CFP quarterfinal loss\n\nESPN's grade for LSU hiring Lane Kiffin will make Ole Miss fans even more mad\n\nDabo Swinney fires Clemson coaches immediately after loss to Penn State\n\nOhio State's Ryan Day faces backlash after Cotton Bowl",

    "fullText": "With six head-coaching openings in the NFL, and possibly more, Bill Belichick's name will be mentioned publicly for one or more of the jobs. Whether he's privately considered for any of them remains to be seen.\n\nAppearing on the Let’s Go! podcast, Belichick was asked by host Jim Gray whether Belichick is interested in returning to the NFL.\n\n“Nothing's changed,\" Belichick said. \"I’m where I was a month ago. I'm here at North Carolina. I really appreciate the love and support that we've gotten from the community down here, from the school, from Chancellor Roberts, the ADs, Bubba Cunningham, Steve Newmark, working with Mike Lombardi and our staff here. We're building a good program and I'm excited about the direction we're headed in.”\n\nIt wasn't a \"no.\" But it's not relevant until someone wants to talk to him.\n\nSince being fired two years ago, he has had one interview, with the Falcons. The Falcons are looking again, with a clean slate (for now) in the front office.\n\nWould owner Arthur Blank want to give Belichick another look, periodic trolling by Jordon Hudson notwithstanding? While it's unclear where his coaching skills currently reside (e.g., would Belichick put a defensive coach in charge of the offense?), we're confident that Belichick wouldn't have given $100 million guaranteed to Kirk Cousins before using a top-10 pick on Michael Penix Jr. if he'd been the Atlanta coach in 2024.\n\nBelichick is currently on the board for five existing vacancies: +4000 for the Giants, +8000 for the Titans, +4000 for the Browns, +1200 for the Falcons, and +1600 for the Raiders. (DraftKings doesn't have odds for the Cardinals' job, for some reason.)\n\nA team will first need to be interested in Belichick. And he'd need to be interested in the team. (Belichick expressed to Gray disdain for teams that use search firms, which could make the search firm running the Falcons' search less inclined to seek him out.)\n\nLast year, when it became clear to Belichick that he wouldn't get a job in the 2025 cycle, he went to North Carolina. Lombardi thereafter questioned whether there are any good jobs in the NFL, while also explaining that he and Belichick prefer working in college football.\n\nMost of the jobs that come open are open for a reason. Still, if Belichick wants to catch Don Shula for the all-time wins record, no number of victories at UNC will matter.",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M's offensive line will look very different in 2026, as head coach Mike Elko and O-line coach Adam Cushing will need to replace four starters, now including junior left guard Chase Bisontis, who has officially declared for the 2026 NFL Draft after three successful seasons in College Station.\n\nA New Jersey native, Bisontis chose the Aggies over Rutgers in the 2023 recruiting class, bringing elite size and versatility at 6'5\" and 315 pounds, and during his first season with the Aggies, Bisontis started at right tackle amid former head coach Jimbo Fisher's final season at the helm.\n\nAfter Fisher was dismissed, Mike Elko felt that Adam Cushing was the perfect choice to help Bisontis reach his full potential, slotting him at left guard, where he has dominated ever since. Logging 1,962 snaps in his Texas A&M career, including 795 snaps, all at left guard during the 2025 season. Bisontis's elite strength will quickly translate to the next level, knowing that NFL scouts see him as a \"plug-and-play\" option at left or right guard.\n\nPro Football Focus graded Bisontis as an above-average pass protector (70.7) and average run blocker (62.7). Still, these grades, compared to most SEC starting guards, prove the level of defensive competition within the conference.\n\nOver the last three days, Texas A&M landed commitments from LSU transfer guard Coen Echols and South Carolina guard Trovon Baugh, which now makes even more sense given today's news. Needing size and SEC experience at left and right guard is key to avoiding a substantial drop-off in the trenches, and credit to Mike Elko for preparing for the inevitable.\n\nTexas A&M OL Chase Bisontis has declared for the 2026 NFL Draft, per his Instagram (chase_bisontis) 👍 #GigEm @CBisontis pic.twitter.com/iQfPNJsSQI\n\n— Luke Evangelist (@lukeevangelist_) January 6, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M star OL Chase Bisontis has declared for the 2026 NFL Draft",

    "fullText": "The Athletic has live coverage of Bears vs. 49ers on NFL “Sunday Night Football.”\n\nGood morning! Keep your job today. Inside:\n\nEvery moment of the past two years has felt like an inflection point for women’s basketball in America. Viewership is surging. Will they capitalize?\n\nIt kind of defeats the entire definition of an inflection point, but if there really is one, the sport has arrived at its doorstep now. Consider:\n\nThe WNBA, after a spike in popularity, is undergoing a contentious negotiation for a new collective bargaining agreement. Salaries and revenue are set to explode. The question is just how the players and league will agree to share the boom.\n\nThe sport’s rise has manifested in other ways. As recently as a couple years ago, it was standard for WNBA players — afforded meager salaries compared to those in other pro sports — to travel overseas to make big money during the offseason.\n\nEnter new leagues like Unrivaled, which opened its second season last night, and Project B, a new venture that will launch in November. While there are differences — Unrivaled is a three-on-three sport, while Project B is more akin to the full game but with a wide travel schedule — they offer similar things: more money, and player equity in the league.\n\nUnrivaled started its sophomore year with four games last night, highlighted by the Mist, an expansion franchise, winning its first game, and Rose, the defending champions, winning by 20. My favorite bit about watching these games: The league uses a modified version of the Elam Ending, in which teams play three timed quarters, but the fourth quarter is untimed. The first team to reach a certain point total (11 points more than the leading team has after three quarters) wins.\n\nI asked Ben Pickman, who wrote an excellent preview of the Unrivaled year yesterday, about whether he thinks the league has a chance to make an imprint on the larger sports world this year:\n\n“Unrivaled already excels at creating social media content that puts WNBA players fully onto viewer radars during the winter. What will be interesting is how its viewership continues to grow and whether fans become more invested in the nightly results of its games. The league’s viewership on TNT and truTV in Year 1 was comparable to the NWSL’s viewership on ESPN networks this past season, and though it is far behind the WNBA’s viewership, the two leagues are of course at varying points in their history.”\n\nBen also made an interesting point to me: With the NBA off TNT, Paige Bueckers, who plays for the Breeze, is the second-most famous athlete broadcast by TNT Sports, behind only Shohei Ohtani.\n\nThese are exciting things. Let’s move on to something a little more dour:\n\nWe discussed the looming specter of “Black Monday” yesterday — the day most NFL coaches get fired. That part came to fruition. What we didn’t expect was the firings to extend beyond the American version of football.\n\nCleveland canned Kevin Stefanski after six years in charge, which saw two playoff appearances, a disastrous trade for Deshaun Watson and a sack record all achieved amid boggling highs and lows. Jason Lloyd writes that, despite those temporary highs, Stefanski leaves behind a lot of bad things.\n\nThe Cardinals fired Jonathan Gannon after three largely unsuccessful seasons. He finishes his tenure 15-36 with no playoff appearances. Tough timing after the team’s X account wished him a happy birthday Sunday.\n\nPete Carroll is officially one-and-done in Las Vegas, which feels like a sad line in what probably will be a Hall of Fame career (a convo for another day). General manager John Spytek, hired last offseason with Carroll, will remain in his role and help Tom Brady with the coaching search. What a weird year.\n\nWe’ll have to wait on movement for replacements, as plenty of those candidates are still coaching for playoff teams. One curious name to consider, though: Philip Rivers.\n\nNow, to the surprising news from across the ocean we briefly mentioned yesterday:\n\nManchester United is done with manager Ruben Amorim after a maddening 14-month tenure that began with lofty promise. Amorim’s critics viewed him as inflexible, though his tactics were successful elsewhere. Man Utd finished 15th in the Premier League table last season and sits sixth right now. One thing will be missed: Amorim’s bizarre news conferences.\n\nIn other soccer sacking news, Celtic parted with Wilfried Nancy after just 33 days in charge. He joined Dec. 3 after a stint with the Columbus Crew. His early dismissal set records.\n\nWoof. Let’s move on to some more … normal news.\n\nHawks, Young working on trade\n\nAtlanta and star guard Trae Young are discussing a possible trade, a source confirmed to The Athletic, which has been a long time coming on a few different levels. Young is still just 27 and in his prime, and still possesses the ability to be an elite scorer. But it’s very clear the Hawks are a better team without him this year, and he can enter free agency after the season. Read our full story here, which includes a potential suitor.\n\nMontana State wins wild FCS title game\n\nMontana State won its first FCS championship since 1984 last night, 35-34 over Illinois State, which had become the Cinderella of the FCS tournament bracket. The game itself was unhinged, and ended after the Bobcats converted a fourth-and-10 for a touchdown in overtime on a pass from quarterback Justin Lamson to Taco Dowler (sweet name). That was merely the caboose for what transpired in the minutes before. The full recap is worth a read.\n\nSweden outlasted Czechia to win its first World Juniors gold medal since 2012 yesterday. More details inside.\n\nIndiana and Alabama drew a record 23.9 million viewers for their Rose Bowl matchup. Yowza.\n\nDolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa is open to a fresh start with a new team. Hm.\n\nColts cornerback Charvarius Ward Sr. said yesterday he is considering retirement after suffering three concussions this season. Read the 29-year-old’s full comments.\n\nTough flip: Notre Dame quarterback Kenny Minchey is heading to Kentucky, just hours after he committed to Nebraska.\n\nF1 driver Checo Pérez said being Max Verstappen’s teammate at Red Bull was the “worst job.” Yikes.\n\n📺 NCAAM: Duke at Louisville\n\n7 p.m. ET on ESPN\n\nThe Blue Devils are ranked No. 6 and have the star power, while the Cardinals are No. 20 and still favored in this game. Sounds like a good sell to me.\n\n📺 NHL: Panthers at Maple Leafs\n\n7:30 p.m. ET on TNT and HBO Max\n\nThe defending champions have steadied a bit after a tough start to the season, while Toronto remains moribund, which has been a slow-burn surprise. \n\n📺 NBA: Heat at Timberwolves\n\n8 p.m. ET on NBC and Peacock\n\nThe best NBA game of the evening is here, and it’s funny that the 23-13 Timberwolves are flying under the proverbial radar a bit. Still great with a Tier 1 scorer, but sitting sixth in the West and biding time until the playoffs. Don’t sleep on them, though.\n\nGet tickets to games like these here.\n\nWe had a scheduling mix-up last week, for which we apologize. Here is the excellent story we promised you then: Katie Whyatt’s look at how sex workers have increasingly used European soccer clubs as sort of a brand boost on social media. Read it here.\n\nNick Baumgardner has a new 2026 NFL mock draft with Oregon QB Dante Moore going No. 1 to Las Vegas. Moore might be deciding between being the No. 1 pick and staying in college.\n\nDan Duggan tore into Giants ownership yesterday for retaining general manager Joe Schoen, arguing the franchise has “no standards anymore.” Make time for this one.\n\nImportant table-setter: Ken Rosenthal and Will Sammon update us on where the Cubs, Yankees and Blue Jays stand as the MLB offseason withers away.\n\nMost-clicked in the newsletter yesterday: NFL playoff schedule.\n\nMost-read on the website yesterday: Our projections of every NFL playoff team’s odds to win the Super Bowl.\n\n📫 That’s all for now!

    "fullText": "NFL playoff picks, predictions for AFC, NFC brackets and Super Bowl 60 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nBuckle up, folks — it's playoff season in the NFL.\n\nThe 2025 season was an abnormal one, and the postseason bracket exemplifies that. Both No. 1 seeds from last year — the Kansas City Chiefs and Detroit Lions — failed to make the playoffs, and the AFC is without Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow and Lamar Jackson.\n\nTeams such as the Seattle Seahawks, Denver Broncos, Jacksonville Jaguars, Chicago Bears and New England Patriots all took major leaps forward this year. The Seahawks and Broncos have the byes in each conference to the divisional round, with their defense propelling them to the top of the standings.\n\nBelow are Sporting News' predictions for the 2026 NFL playoffs, complete with updated Super Bowl 60 picks. Our NFL experts break down the brackets and project which players will break out, which contenders will break down, and which teams will break through during the postseason.\n\nNFL playoff power rankings, 1-14\n\nBill Bender: Buffalo Bills. Kansas City isn't in the way this year. Josh Allen is 7-2 against everybody else in the playoffs – but the only thing holding us back is that Buffalo will have to prove it on the road. Allen is 0-4 on the road in the postseason and the path starts at Jacksonville. The Jaguars have allowed more than 20 points one time through a seven-game win streak.\n\nDaniel Chavkin: The Houston Texans. The Texans are the hottest team in the NFL with a stifling defense and an offense that has found a rhythm. Quietly, Houston has won a playoff game in back-to-back seasons, giving them experience at the biggest stage that the top of this year's AFC field doesn't possess. If CJ Stroud plays to an efficient level, this team has the formula to win anywhere in January.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Los Angeles Rams. This might be rather obvious but they have a rejuvenated MVP-caliber Matthew Stafford at QB with Sean McVay as their coach, the combination that helped them win Super Bowl 56 with similar support from the receiving corps, defense and running game. They were also smart to drive for the No. 5 seed so they get the easiest road game early, before a potential toss-up rematch with the Seahawks\n\nDaniel Mader: The Buffalo Bills. The AFC bracket is loaded with up-and-coming, yet unproven quarterbacks — this is the best chance Josh Allen has ever had to reach the Super Bowl, even as a No. 6 seed. Buffalo’s five-loss record doesn’t concern me much, nor does the lack of a true WR1 or a defense that has struggled at times. With Allen, the Bills are capable of beating any team in the AFC.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: The Los Angeles Rams remain one of the most well-rounded teams in the NFL. A strong run game and the efforts of Davante Adams and Puka Nacua as wide receivers carry the offense. Adams missed the end of the regular season so that he could help up for the playoffs, and he is expected to be back. Los Angeles goes on the road to take on the Carolina Panthers in the first round, where the Rams lost 31-28 in Week 13. Still, the Rams are set up for an easy first-round matchup and should go on a deep run as long as they don't completely look past the Panthers in the first round.\n\nDavid Suggs: The Los AngelesRams. Special mention for the 49ers, Texans, Patriots, Jaguars, Bills and Eagles, all of whom could easily contend for a Super Bowl crown. But Los Angeles is a well-rounded unit that has gamers on both sides of the ball. The Rams are the NFL's most explosive offense and have enjoyed a fair few shutdown showings on defense.\n\nEd Williams: Los Angeles Rams. This team checks all of the boxes of a true Super Bowl threat. First and foremost, the Rams defeated the Bengals in Super Bowl 56 just a few years ago. While some key names like Cooper Kupp and Aaron Donald are missing from that squad, younger playmakers like Puka Nacua and Jared Verse have risen to prominence since then. Matthew Stafford is an MVP favorite, and Davante Adams as emerged as a favorite red zone target. And Sean McVay is widely considered one of the best coaches in the league. The defense can give up yards and points, but they're also dynamic and capable of forcing turnovers at any time. As far as wild-card teams go, no one is looking forward to the Rams coming to town.\n\nBill Bender: Philadelphia Eagles. The Jaguars are an underdog and the Bears line against the Packers will be short either way. Those are not upsets. The 49ers – despite all the injuries – still have a defense that ranked 11th against the run. Brock Purdy had a 111 passer rating on the road. Philadelphia finished 5-3 at home this season – and that included a 1-2 record against playoff teams. Will the Super Bowl champions be an early exit?\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Philadelphia Eagles. The defending champions have had a rocky season, winning the NFC East on the backs of a strong defense. But the offensive issues have persisted throughout the season and remain a problem entering the playoffs. While the defense is one of the best, the Eagles will have to find a way to score consistently in order to make it back to the Super Bowl. With a tough 49ers team on tap first, the Eagles offensive concerns could send them home quickly.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Chicago Bears. They've been living on the edge with some low-scoring games and fourth-quarter comebacks. It's been a massive breakthrough season all around with Caleb Williams and Ben Johnson, but they can be in trouble right away vs. the Packers if they don't get the turnovers to bounce in their favor.\n\nDaniel Mader: The Chicago Bears. Ben Johnson has clearly elevated this franchise in every way it hoped he would, and this has been a terrific Bears season that offers plenty of hope for the future. But I do think some one-score luck played a big role in Chicago’s 11-6 record, and I question how sustainable it is. Anything can happen in divisional games. I buy the Packers’ playoff experience over the Bears.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: No disrespect to the Jacksonville Jaguars; they have had an incredible bounce-back season. Looking at the first-round matchups for the top teams, though, Jacksonville will have to host Buffalo. The Bills went 12-5 this season and that was playing well below their potential. Yes, Buffalo has to hit the road, but if it all comes together for them as it can and Josh Allen looks like the player who won the MVP Award last season, it could easily be an early postseason exit for the Jaguars.\n\nDavid Suggs: The Denver Broncos. Denver enjoyed a wondrous campaign under Sean Payton and its defense is arguably the NFL's best, surrendering the third-fewest points in the league. But there's reason to believe the Broncos' luck could be running out. They were 11-2 in one-score games this season, a record that, while impressive, could be hard to maintain against the AFC's best sides. Bo Nix still leaves something to be desired and the Broncos' toils against teams like the Jets, Giants, Raiders and Commanders suggests they're not quite the juggernaut their record would initially indicate.\n\nEd Williams: Jacksonville Jaguars. The turnaround Liam Coen has pulled off in Jacksonville is impressive, and he probably should be getting more attention for Coach of the Year. But unfortunately for them, they draw Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills. Some of the game's biggest names at QB will be missing from the postseason this year like Patrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson, but the reigning MVP is back as a 12-5 No. 6 seed. While his receiving weapons won't instill fear into opposing defenses themselves, Allen's ability to take over a game at any moment certainly can cause sleepless nights. And on top of that, James Cook was the league's leading rusher and gives them another threat to break off chunk plays. Trevor Lawrence will have to keep his hot streak going to keep pace with Allen, and the much-improved Jags defense will need to prove this isn't the same old Jags. It's not an impossible task, but the Jags likely would have preferred to see the Chargers or Texans.\n\nBill Bender: Bills QB Josh Allen. Matthew Stafford and Drake Maye are acceptable answers – and the potential for a third matchup between the Bills and Patriots could be in the cards. Allen has everything but a Super Bowl appearance on his resume at this point. It's time to change that.\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Will Anderson: Ten years ago, Von Miller capped his incredible playoff run with a Super Bowl in San Francisco, providing a blueprint for Will Anderson. If it weren't for Myles Garrett's record-breaking season, Anderson would be among the favorites to win Defensive Player of the Year, as his career-high 12 sacks sparked the Texans defense to the top of the NFL. With a few of the top quarterbacks sitting at home, it will be a defensive player shining the brightest in January.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence. There's every reason to believe he will keep this hot streak groove in full command of Liam Coen's balanced and explosive offense into the playoffs. The Bills' defense has plenty of holes to exploit in the wild-card round and he's already proved he can rip Denver's defense. He will keep breaking out on delay as the No. 1 pick talent he was supposed to be, five years after he was drafted.\n\nDaniel Mader: The man who can still be considered the reigning league MVP, Josh Allen. Buffalo’s star quarterback seemed to get better as the regular season went on, and I think he’ll continue that trend into the postseason without any Patrick Mahomes-shaped ghosts to worry about. Allen can be considered the most dynamic individual talent in the 2026 playoffs.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: Drake Maye and head coach Mike Vrabel seem like the perfect marriage, poised to be a threat in the AFC for years to come. Just when the league got past the dominance of New England, this duo is bringing it back. Maye can run Vrabel's offense, and the defensive-minded head coach can focus on what he knows best. Maye might miss out on the regular-season MVP Award, but he has a great chance to win playoff MVP because he likely won't be benched in the third quarter because of huge leads.\n\nDavid Suggs:Puka Nacua. If the Rams are to win the Super Bowl, their third-year pass-catcher will be among the biggest reasons why. Nacua is as steady as they come, finding success against both man and zone coverages. I reckon he'll keep the good times rolling during the playoffs.\n\nEd Williams: Jalen Hurts. The Eagles offense has not exactly been a thing of beauty during the regular season, but Jalen Hurts has a habit of playing his best football when the lights are brightest. Passing game struggles were a common issue in 2024 as well, but when the playoffs came around, the Eagles seemed to flip a switch and were airing it out seemingly at will. Last year they also had a historic season from Saquon Barkley in the running game. That has not been the case in 2025, as the offensive line has struggled mightily. If the Eagles offense is going to flip a switch again, it's likely going to have to be Jalen Hurts. The weapons are there with A.J. Brown, DeVonte Smith and Barkley, plus tight end Dallas Goedert has evolved into a deadly red zone target. The Eagles offense is at its best when Jalen Hurts is also hurting defenses with his legs, and now that they're in the postseason and it's win or go home, look for him to run more often than he did during the regular season. The playcalling and sequencing from rookie offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo hasn't done Hurts any favors this season, but the reigning Super Bowl MVP can block out all the noise and silence his doubters once and for all if he can lead Philly back to the promised land.\n\nBill Bender: Rams defensive end Jared Verse. Verse had five pressures or \n\nDaniel Chavkin: RJ Harvey. Fantasy players know how talented RJ Harvey is, but it's time for the rookie to break out in the biggest moment. The Broncos offense will need Harvey to provide a spark in the running game and give Bo Nix a reliable back, allowing them to make a run to the Super Bowl. Harvey didn't surpass 75 yards in any game during his rookie season, but expect that to change once Denver takes the field in January.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Patriots edge rusher Harold Landry. The former Titan has been more impactful down the stretch rushing the passer for Mike Vrabel and he can be a more disruptive defensive force the team needs against better QBs in the playoffs.\n\nDaniel Mader: I’ll throw out a pair of Jaguars offensive weapons here: wide receiver Parker Washington and tight end Brenton Strange. While Jacksonville gets a tough first-round matchup against Buffalo, I’ve found it impressive how Trevor Lawrence has continued to thrive despite Brian Thomas Jr. not being the same talent as 2024 and Travis Hunter’s season ending early. Washington and Strange can make a bigger name for themselves if they help the Jags take down the Bills.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: Seahawks linebacker Ernest Jones IV led Seattle with 126 total tackles on the year. He is a beast in coverage and it is hard for any runner to get past him when he goes to tackle them. Jones has had a phenomenal year when dropping into pass coverage too. He has seven passes defended and leads Seattle with an impressive five interceptions, the second-most by any player in the NFL this year. You've likely heard of rookie safety Nick Emmanwori for Seattle, but be ready to get to know Jones.\n\nDavid Suggs:Woody Marks. The Texans' rookie numbers don't necessarily pop off the page at first glance. But he established himself as Houston's No. 1 tailback as the season wore on, tallying 15 or more carries in five of his last seven games. Marks is a gifted pass-catcher in space whose elusiveness figures to cause problems for opposition defenses. He should prove to be one of C.J. Stroud's favorite safety blankets.\n\nEd Williams: Eagles linebacker Jalyx Hunt spent three years at Cornell playing safety before transferring to Houston Christian University, where he transitioned to a linebacker/EDGE player. The Eagles drafted him in the third round at pick 94, which seemed like it might have been a reach at the time. But Hunt's development in Vic Fangio's system has been something to behold. He flashed some serious potential in his limited opportunities as a rookie, but after the Eagles let Josh Sweat walk in free agency and with Brandon Graham's retirement and Nolan Smith's triceps injury to start the season, Hunt was thrust into a starting role. Hunt was thrown right into the deep end, and he's really excelled in the expanded role. He leads the team in pressures (55), QB hits (24), sacks (6.5) and interceptions (3). In fact, he leads all EDGE rushers in the NFL with three picks. His 21.2% pressure rate on third down is 8th among NFL EDGE rushers this year. He's the only player in the history of the Eagles franchise to lead the team in both INTs and sacks. The Eagles can bring pressure in many ways, but Hunt just seems to get better and better the more he plays, and the scary thing is, he's still relatively new to the position.\n\nBill Bender: Los Angeles Rams. Matthew Stafford is playing at a MVP level, and they are good enough to make a run through the NFC. Sean McVay knows how to move the pieces with Kyren Williams and Puka Nacua. Davante Adams should return for the playoff run. The Seahawks were the only team in the NFC that limited Los Angeles to 21 points or less this season.\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Jacksonville Jaguars. Since Week 7, the Jaguars have scored at least 23 points in all 11 games, including seven games with at least 30 points. Head coach Liam Coen has Trevor Lawrence playing at a high level, which included dropping 34 points on the Denver Broncos in Week 16. Many of this year's playoff teams are defense-first teams, but it was Jacksonville's scorching-hot offense that led the Jaguars back to the playoffs.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Los Angeles Rams. Matthew Stafford and Sean McVay get it done with so many skill players behind a strong offensive line. They can dominate with wide receivers or burn you with tight ends. They can also now field a 1-2 punch in the power running game. The Rams have a consistent floor and a high ceiling.\n\nDaniel Mader: The Los Angeles Rams. Matthew Stafford had a career year, which says a lot at age 37. I think the Rams go as far as their young defense takes them, meaning I expect Stafford’s arm to continue thriving in the playoffs. I’m not confident the Seahawks, Eagles or any other team can slow down Puka Nacua and Davante Adams for 60 minutes.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: The Los Angeles Rams are getting healthy and that is going to be a problem for defenses. Even when Los Angeles didn't have Davante Adams through the end of the season, tight end Tyler Higbee was activated off of IR and had 91 yards and a touchdown. Add in Adams to Kyren Williams, Puka Nacua, Tyler Higbee and Colby Parkinson and you've got one of the deeper offenses in the playoffs. Oh, and L.A. happened to score the most points per game (30.1) during the regular season.\n\nDavid Suggs: The Los Angeles Rams. They led the league in scoring and averaged 31.75 points across four matchups with the Seahawks and 49ers. Matthew Stafford was a revelation this year, while Los Angeles boasts perhaps the best pass-catching tandem in the sport in Puka Nacua and Davante Adams. I think the points will keep on flowing in Tinseltown.\n\nEd Williams: Los Angeles Rams. Sean McVay can get conservative at times, but when push comes to shove, give me Matthew Stafford, Puka Nacua, Davante Adams, the Kyren Williams/Blake Corum duo at running back and the playcalling and offensive scheming of the head coach over any other team in the postseason. Josh Allen may be the most dynamic quarterback in the playoffs, but the Rams are the most complete offense. You can get pressure on Matthew Stafford, but he's also capable of getting the ball out quickly and he can throw at weird angles to get around defenders in pursuit. If the defense isn't finishing and bringing him down, the Rams could go all the way.\n\nBill Bender: Houston Texans. Houston hasn't given up more than 21 points in a game since Week 10 – and they allowed an average of 15.4 points per game on the road this season. The Texans allowed 30 points in Week 18 – but we're not worried about that. The tandem of Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson Jr. can wreck a game plan – and that should bring more than enough confidence going into a matchup with the AFC North champions.\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Seattle Seahawks. It's hard to hold the 49ers to three points in San Francisco, but that's exactly what the Seahawks did on Saturday. Under second-year head coach Mike MacDonald, Seattle's defense can match up against any offense, especially when they won't have to leave Seattle for the rest of the NFC playoffs. Combine incredible talent with a high-level defensive play-caller, and you get the most trustworthy defense in the league.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Seattle Seahawks. They have become super stingy against the pass with pressure and coverage clicking and they always have been tough to run against. In a season of big-time scoring, they held opponents to an average of 17.2 points per game.\n\nDaniel Mader: The Seattle Seahawks. Mike Macdonald looks like a home-run hire for Seattle, with a terrific blend of versatility, dominant pass rushing and overall disruptiveness on his defensive unit. The Seahawks are like an inverse Rams to me: I expect their defense to win games, but the bigger question is whether Sam Darnold is ready to take a leap toward playoff success.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: The Seattle Seahawks earned the No. 1 seed in the NFC partly due to having the league's leading wide receiver, but also boasting one of the best defenses in the NFL. This feels the closest the Seahawks have been to re-capturing the Legion of Boom dominance as the unit finds itself in the top-10 for several defensive metrics. Seattle's defense ranks 2nd in points against per game, fifth in first downs allowed, sixth in total yards allowed. The Seahawks have given up the 12th-fewest passing yards and third-fewest rushing yards per game.\n\nDavid Suggs: The Houston Texans. Houston's defense has it all; tough tacklers are littered across the front seven, while the secondary is awash with starlight. DeMeco Ryans' side conceded just 14 to the Rams, 15 to the 49ers, 17 to the Jaguars and 19 to the Bills. I'm expecting them to offer similar displays during postseason play.\n\nEd Williams: Philadelphia Eagles. There have been a couple blips on the radar along the way, but the Eagles' defense has really carried the team in 2025. While the offense has gone through highly-publicized struggles this season, one of the youngest defenses in the league has outperformed expectations. Quinyon Mitchell followed up his impressive rookie campaign by being the only cornerback in the league to be targeted 60+ times and not allow a TD (82 targets). He also allowed the lowest completion percentage among all cornerbacks. Cooper DeJean is already one of, if not the best nickel cornerbacks in the league, and the linebacker tandem of Zach Baun and Nakobe Dean might be the best in the league. The defensive front is stacked with Jalen Carter finally looking healthier after shoulder issues, Jordan Davis enjoying a career year, Nolan Smith rounding into form, Jalyx Hunt continuing to ascend and free agent acquisition Jaelan Phillips paying immediate dividends. But the X-factor is Vic Fangio who always seems to have an answer at the most important times. This defense can give up yards and production, but while they may bend, they don't typically break and tighten things up in the red zone.\n\nBill Bender: Buffalo Bills. Too much belief? Buffalo was 3-3 against teams that are in the postseason this year, but it's time for the breakthrough. James Cook will keep the running game going. Buffalo has just one turnover in its last four games. Can they go through Jacksonville, New England and Denver to get back to the Super Bowl for the first time since 1993?\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Houston Texans. The Texans have never made it to the AFC Championship game, but that ends this year on their trip to the Super Bowl. Houston has a defense that can travel on the road and win anywhere, which will help carry the Texans to cold-weather cities in the dead of winter. Plus, DeMeco Ryans is already one of the best young coaches in the NFL, and he will show why with a deep playoff run.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Jacksonville Jaguars. Their profile has fewer weaknesses by the passing week. Trevor Lawrence fills the elite AFC QB void left by no Patrick Mahomes and they suddenly look loaded there, playing off Travis Etienne and the running game. Their defense is also opportunistic in forcing takeaways in crucial game-changing moments.\n\nDaniel Mader: The Buffalo Bills. Part of my reasoning is that I simply can’t yet trust the crop of Bo Nix, Drake Maye, Trevor Lawrence or Justin Herbert until one of those quarterbacks breaks through and proves they can lead a team to multiple playoff wins. Until then, I won’t bet against Josh Allen, the most proven and dynamic quarterback in the playoffs. Down the stretch of close games, he’s who I think can lead a team through the bracket.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: The turnaround in one year has been impressive for the New England Patriots. The Patriots have a great quarterback and a pair of running backs that can help consistently get the offense down the field. As long as Stefon Diggs' off-the-field issues don't prevent him from playing in the playoffs, New England is in a prime position to get back to the Super Bowl, and will match up well no matter who the Patriots play in the postseason.\n\nDavid Suggs: The Jacksonville Jaguars. Call this one wishful thinking. But the Jaguars have been on a tear as of late, vanquishing eight straight sides to climb to the upper echelons of the AFC. Trevor Lawrence has looked every bit like the highly-touted talent he was suggested to be while in college. Jacksonville shone in wins over the Texans, 49ers, Chargers and Broncos. Liam Coen's bunch will keep the good times rolling in the playoffs.\n\nEd Williams: Buffalo Bills. Both the AFC and NFC are really wide open this year. The Bills are a 6-seed, so they'll likely have to be on the road the entire postseason, but Josh Allen is the best quarterback in the postseason. Drake Maye has put together an MVP-caliber campaign in just his second year, but they also have had a relatively easy schedule. This will be his first taste of the postseason, while Allen is no stranger to the perils of postseason play. If the Bills are able to get by Jacksonville in the first round, barring a Chargers upset of the Patriots, they'll get the Broncos in the divisional round. While the Broncos have a great defense, the two teams also met in the playoffs last year, and the Bills emerged with a convincing 31-7 victory. While it would likely be much closer this time around, I'll take Josh Allen over Bo Nix any day of the week.\n\nBill Bender: Los Angeles Rams. This is a tough pick because we believe they will have to go through the Seahawks to get there. Seattle is a real threat, and Sam Darnold has been on point all season. We think those teams will see each other in either the divisional round or the NFC championship game – and a rematch of the 38-37 thriller in Week 16 is in order. The Rams had 581 yards in that game.\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Seattle Seahawks. Getting home-field advantage was crucial for the Seahawks, as there is no tougher place to play in January than Seattle. With the NFC full of fierce opponents, the bye will help the Seahawks get healthy and prepare while their opponents battle on wild-card weekend. As long as Sam Darnold can protect the football, which he has done for most of the season, Seattle should be favored to make it out of the NFC.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Seattle Seahawks. This is an odd feeling that they are back in a position to win a Super Bowl far removed from Russell Wilson and Pete Carroll days. Mike Macdonald has created a dominant defense that can win a championship with Sam Darnold just needing to protect the ball as a complementary QB.\n\nDaniel Mader: The Los Angeles Rams. Playing in a loaded NFC West was tough for L.A. after a strong start to the season, but I still think this is the most talented offense in football with a young defense that has stepped up plenty of times before. If the Rams can avoid their previous special teams issues, their path to the Super Bowl is there: beat an 8-9 Panthers team, take down a familiar Seahawks squad in the divisional round, then overcome the Eagles, 49ers, Packers or Bears, all of whom have their flaws, in the NFC Championship Game.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: I think the Los Angeles Rams beat the Carolina Panthers, but then benefit from the San Francisco 49ers beating the Philadelphia Eagles. This would allow Los Angeles to face the Chicago Bears before either the Seattle Seahawks or the Niners in the NFC Championship game. I think the Rams have the deepest offense and the second-best defense in the NFC playoff picture which should help them to win the NFC.\n\nDavid Suggs:The Los Angeles Rams. Losses to the Seahawks and Falcons scuppered what looked to be a push for the NFC's No. 1 seed in Los Angeles. But Stafford has been the league's best hurler and has a championship pedigree. Sean McVay will have the Rams ready for the winter, just as they were in 2019 and 2022. Los Angeles fell just short of the NFC Championship last year. It will do one better in 2025, beating all comers to punch its ticket for the Super Bowl.\n\nEd Williams: Philadelphia Eagles. While it hasn't been pretty at times, Philadelphia managed to avoid a true Super Bowl hangover and are not only back in the postseason, but broke the NFC East curse and won the division for the second straight year — the first time that feat has been accomplished since the Eagles won four straight division titles from 2001-2004. The defense has carried the team at times, but the talent on the offensive side of the ball cannot be discounted. Even though they've struggled with consistency, Jalen Hurts, A.J. Brown, DeVonta Adams, Saquon Barkley and company are capable of beating any defense if they are all on the same page. Jalen Hurts has proven he doesn't shrink in the spotlight, and that experience can help carry them through some tough matchups along the way. The two seeds above them in the Seattle Seahawks and Chicago Bears do not boast much postseason experience, so it's not out of the question that Eagles can gain more home-field advantage along the way, and The Linc is a difficult place to play, especially in the colder months.\n\nBill Bender: Buffalo Bills beat Los Angeles Rams. Two wild-card teams? It's a risky pick, but this is a wide-open playoff. Defense matters, and the Rams had some late-season concerns. It's not just about Josh Allen and Matthew Stafford, but in the playoffs, the QBs take center stage. Would Stafford win a second Super Bowl? Or will Buffalo finally win a Super Bowl? Allen finally gets it done.\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Houston Texans over Seattle Seahawks. It's been a weird year in the NFL, so it's only fitting that the Super Bowl champion is an unexpected victor. DeMeco Ryan and the Texans are on a nine-game winning streak entering the playoffs, and thanks to a strong defense and timely offense, will ride the winning streak four more games to a Super Bowl title in a low-scoring battle against Seattle.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Jacksonville Jaguars over Seattle Seahawks. In the ultimate season of surprise, let's go for a team that has never been to a Super Bowl to win a Super Bowl on its first try. Lawrence gives the Jaguars a QB equalizer or edge over most teams and the Jaguars match up well with the Seahawks as they excel at forcing takeaways and the Seahawks often have trouble with giveaways.\n\nDaniel Mader: The Los Angeles Rams. There are plenty of reasons to doubt L.A., as there are for every team in the bracket this season, but between the Rams’ head coach, terrific quarterback play, talented wide receiver duo and group of defensive playmakers, I still think they have another gear to reach. Give me the Rams’ second Super Bowl win in five years.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: It hurts taking the New England Patriots to win another Super Bowl after we had to deal with their recent dynasty, but no matter the matchup they face this postseason, they should be favored or at the very least match up well. If they had a more prolific WR2 in the offense, it feels like New England would be everyone's favorite. I think the Patriots and Rams play each other in the Super Bowl, and New England is able to do just enough to win another ring.\n\nDavid Suggs:The Los Angeles Rams. I just think they've got a really balanced side that is capable of causing opposition sides problems in a number of ways. McVay, Stafford and Los Angeles beat the Jaguars to hoist their second Lombardi Trophy since returning to Hollywood.\n\nEd Williams: Philadelphia Eagles. The Eagles just outlasted the Bills a couple of weeks ago in Week 17 of the regular season, but that could have been just a preview of what we might see in the Super Bowl. While Levi's Stadium is not a dome, it's also not likely they'll have to deal with monsoon freezing rain conditions like the two squads just dealt with in Buffalo. The offenses should be able to put more points on the board, but it's the Eagles defense that will come up big in limiting Josh Allen, and Jalen Hurts will silence his critics once again with another Super Bowl MVP award.",

    "fullText": "After Travis Kelce exited the field solemnly on Sunday night in Las Vegas after the Kansas City Chiefs fell for the final time this NFL season, there was one question on every fan, pundit, and probably even player’s mind:\n\nWas that the last game Travis Kelce ever played?\n\nOn Monday, we have somewhat of an answer, albeit one many fans might not have wanted to hear.\n\nFollowing the team’s game, Kelce shuffled into the locker room and was faced with questions from the media about his future plans with the Chiefs and if he had already decided on his future.\n\nKelce admitted that after the Chiefs' Super Bowl loss last year, he instantly knew he would be back with the Chiefs the next season.

    "fullText": "The NFL playoff field is set, and it's missing half of the league's top 10 highest-paid quarterbacks in average annual value.\n\nSpotrac made note of that fact on Monday, a day after the dust settled on the NFL's regular season. Of the league's top 10 paid quarterbacks, Josh Allen, Trevor Lawrence, Jordan Love, Brock Purdy and Justin Herbert are all in the postseason.\n\nDak Prescott, Joe Burrow, Tua Tagovailoa, Jared Goff and Lamar Jackson are not.\n\nHalf of the Top 10 Average Paid QBs made the playoffs - half didn't.\n\nDak Prescott ❌\nJosh Allen ✅\nJoe Burrow ❌\nTrevor Lawrence ✅\nJordan Love ✅\nTua Tagovailoa ❌\nJared Goff ❌\nBrock Purdy ✅\nJustin Herbert ✅\nLamar Jackson ❌\n\n— Spotrac (@spotrac) January 5, 2026\n\nWhich got us to thinking. Are teams hamstringing their playoff chances in a salary-capped league by paying premiums for quarterbacks? Is it too difficult in the modern NFL to build a competitive roster around a quarterback playing on a premium salary?\n\nQuarterback is the most important position in football, if not in all of sports. It's difficult to win a Super Bowl without a high-end signal caller, though Super Bowls have been won with Nick Foles, Jeff Hostetler, Jim Plunkett, Brad Johnson and Trent Dilfer.\n\nBut having a Patrick Mahomes, Tom Brady, Peyton Manning or Joe Montana is historically the best ingredient for success. And they cost money.\n\nHere's a look at the salaries of starting quarterbacks for all 32 NFL teams, grouped by whether or not they made the playoffs. Players with a top-10 salary are in bold.\n\nCaleb Williams: $9.9 million (rookie contract)\n\nBryce Young: $9.5 million (rookie contract)\n\nDrake Maye: $9.2 million (rookie contract)\n\nC.J. Stroud: $9.1 million (rookie contract)\n\nBo Nix: $4.7 million (rookie contract)\n\nDak Prescott, Cowboys: $60 million\n\nJoe Burrow, Bengals: $55 million\n\nTua Tagovailoa, Dolphins: $53.1 million\n\nLamar Jackson, Ravens: $52 million\n\nKyler Murray, Cardinals: $46.1 million\n\nKirk Cousins, Falcons: $45 million\n\nPatrick Mahomes, Chiefs: $45 million\n\nGeno Smith, Raiders: $37.5 million\n\nBaker Mayfield, Buccaneers: $33.3 million\n\nJustin Fields, Jets: $20 million\n\nDaniel Jones, Colts: $14 million\n\nCam Ward, Titans: $12.2 million (rookie contract)\n\nJayden Daniels, Commanders: $9.4 million (rookie contract)\n\nJ.J. McCarthy, Vikings: $5.5 million (rookie contract)\n\nJaxson Dart, Giants: $4.2 million (rookie contract)\n\nTyler Shough, Saints: $2.7 million (rookie contract)\n\nShedeur Sanders, Browns: $1.2 million (rookie contract)\n\nIt's notable that five of the 12 playoff quarterbacks are playing on rookie contracts, which are capped by the collective bargaining agreement.\n\nThat cost control is extremely valuable, and optimizing roster construction around rookie quarterback contracts is a proven formula for success. Since the inception of the rookie wage scale in 2011, the Seattle Seahawks with Russell Wilson (2014 season) and the Kansas City Chiefs with Mahomes (2019 season) have navigated the rookie wage scale to Super Bowl victories.\n\nThis, season, the Patriots have an MVP candidate in Maye who's the ninth-highest paid player on the team. Nix playing on a $4.7 million salary has allowed the Broncos to build a Super Bowl contender despite Wilson's disastrous contract remaining on the books.\n\nStroud, meanwhile is a veteran quarterback in his third season who's surrounded by one of the NFL's fiercest defenses. It would not be a surprise to see any of them playing in or winning the Super Bowl in January.\n\nThis is an optimal way to build a Super contender in the short window available to pay quarterbacks on a rookie contract. This, of course, requires hitting successfully on a quarterback in the draft who can lead a team to contention at a young age.\n\nAnd it's also, obviously, not the only path to success. Thirteen of the 15 Super Bowls won since the inception of the rookie wage scale have been won by quarterbacks not playing on a rookie deal.\n\nAt some point, those rookie quarterbacks will be due for extensions. And if you've got a high-end quarterback on your hands who's due to be paid, there's little choice but to pay him. And that doesn't mean that you can't build a successful roster around said quarterback.\n\nYes, half of the top 10 paid quarterbacks will be watching the playoffs from home. But it's a little absurd to suggest that that's an indictment of paying top quarterbacks their market value.\n\nBurrow missed most of the season due to injury. Do the Bengals have also roster construction issues? Absolutely. But that's an issue that's plagued the franchise for pretty much the entirety of its existence under Brown family ownership, with or without a premium quarterback on the roster.\n\nThe Cowboys likewise have roster concerns that limited their upside. Like with the Bengals, it's fairer to take a look at the decades-long management under Jerry Jones (and the defense specifically this year) than point to the $60 million salary of Prescott, who was excellent this season, to explain why the Cowboys aren't in the playoffs.\n\nIt's difficult to argue that the Lions and Ravens didn't build strong rosters around Goff and Jackson. There's talent on both sides of the ball on both teams outside of their quarterbacks. And Jackson was clearly limited by injuries this season, while the Lions were ravaged by injuries of their own.\n\nIn the end, 14 of the league's 32 teams make the playoffs. The Ravens and Lions just missed out, but it wouldn't be a surprise for either or both to return to contention next season.\n\nAnd then there's Tagovailoa. His contract at this point was pretty clearly a mistake. He got benched at the end of the season, and his time in Miami very well may be done. The Dolphins would surely take a do-over on his deal of they could.\n\nBut the Prescott, Jackson, Burrow and Goff deals? There are surely no regrets from their respective franchises. Teams without high-end quarterbacks would certainly jump at the chance to take their contracts on.",

I cannot express properly in words how good we have been treated.\"\n\nThe Browns confirmed Andrew Berry, who was hired in 2020 alongside Stefanski, will remain as general manager.\n\nStefanski is the second NFL head coach to be fired following the end of the season after the Atlanta Falcons dismissed Raheem Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot on Sunday night.\n\nThe Falcons went back-to-back seasons with an 8-9 record under Morris, who joined in 2024, and failed to reach the play-offs during Fontenot's five-year stint.",

    "fullText": "Ranking 6 best Raiders coaching candidates to replace Pete Carroll, from Klint Kubiak to Chris Shula originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAccording to several reports, the return of Pete Carroll as an NFL head coach will last only one season. The former Seahawks Super Bowl winner flamed out with the Raiders in 2025 in a short but tumultuous tenure at age 74.\n\nCarroll's defense disappointed with Patrick Graham calling plays. The offense was a dysfunctional mess with coordinator Chip Kelly being fired during the season.\n\nKeeping in mind that Tom Brady is part owner and the team is well-positioned to take a franchise QB high in the 2026 NFL Draft, here's looking at the top potential replacements for Carroll.\n\nNFL MOCK DRAFT 2026:Raiders land Indiana's Fernando Mendoza at No. 1\n\nKlint Kubiak would be considered for his great pocket passing work with Sam Darnold in a balanced and explosive Seattle offense. He would be a great immediate personality and schematic influence on a rookie QB such as Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza or Oregon's Dante Moore.\n\nKliff Kingsbury is a good friend of Tom Brady's, having spent some time as a fellow Patriots QB. Kingsbury was huge in leading to a big rookie season for Jayden Daniels to help a quick turnaround in Washington in 2024. He also can provide that impact for Mendoza or Moore, as he was once attached to the Cardinals in 2019 when they were set to take Kyler Murray at No. 1 overall.\n\nMike LaFleur would be the top choice for Tom Brady and the ownership straight from the Sean McVay tree. He's overdue to get a job as the rising star younger brother of Packers coach Matt.\n\nVance Joseph would be a good defensive path to consider as he's become a stronger second-chance coaching candidate working under Sean Payton in Denver. He would help clean up things defensively and add some good experience.\n\nTom Brady can go after the former DC from his alma mater, Michigan, straight from fellow former Wolverines QB Jim Harbaugh. Jesse Minter is a rising star with his play-calling for the rival Chargers.\n\nTom Brady is a historian of the game and should also notice the strong influence and play-calling Chris Shula, the son of late Hall of Fame coaching legend Don, has done working on the other side of the ball from Mike LaFleur for McVay. Shula can provided needed youthful energy and motivation that was lost from Carroll.",

If the Ravens beat the Steelers on Sunday Night Football, they will host Houston in the Wild Card round.\n\nThe NFL closes out the 2025-26 regular season schedule with the Pittsburgh Steelers hosting the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday Night Football. The game kicks off at 8:20 p.m. ET with the AFC North title on the line. The Ravens are a 3.5-point road favorite heading into the matchup.\n\nThe big news for this matchup is that Baltimore will have Lamar Jackson back at QB. He missed last week’s game against the Packers due to a back injury. He’s been banged up for much of this season but is still a proven upgrade over Tyler Huntley. The Ravens would have been an underdog in this matchup if Jackson couldn’t go.\n\nThe Ravens have to win to secure the AFC North and the accompanying playoff berth. They are 8-8 and win would improve them to 9-8. The Steelers are 9-7 and a loss would drop them to 9-8. A Ravens win would even the season series but give Baltimore the division record tiebreaker.\n\nThe winner of the game will secure the No. 4 seed in the playoffs.

Obviously that is much easier said than done.\n\nThis upcoming offseason is one of the most important and critical in recent Cowboys history as they have multiple first-round draft picks for the first time since 2008. With the Cowboys now officially done for the season, we know where they will be picking come the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nHere are the first 12 picks of the draft, through the Cowboys selection at number 12 overall, courtesy of Tankathon.\n\nIf all of this sounds familiar it is because it is… the Cowboys held the 12th overall pick last year and used it to select Tyler Booker. They also used it in 2021 to select Micah Parsons, more on him in a moment, although they picked it up after trading back two spots. For what it’s worth the Detroit Lions held the pick in consecutive seasons beginning the year after and landed Jameson Williams and Jahmyr Gibbs, so hopefully that type of success is what the Cowboys find.\n\nWhile we know where the Cowboys are picking, it is still unknown exactly where their other first-round pick will land. Dallas holds Green Bay’s selection in the 2026 NFL Draft and the Packers are currently set to visit the Chicago Bears in the Wild Card Round which means we are all rooting for Chicago to take care of business.\n\nKeep in mind that Dallas has also already dealt away 2026 draft capital as well.\n\n2nd: Dealt away in Quinnen Williams trade\n\n3rd: Dealt away in George Pickens trade\n\n6th: Dealt away in Jordan Phillips trade with New York Giants in early 2024, also received a 7th that was sent to the Cincinnati Bengals in exchange for Logan Wilson\n\n7th (Kansas City’s): Acquired from the Chiefs when Dallas sent them Peyton Hendershot in early 2024\n\n7th (their own): Dealt away when Dallas traded for Kaiir Elam in early 2025\n\nThe Cowboys are projected to receive a couple of compensatory picks as well, potentially in the fifth-round, but those are not fully known at this time.",

    "description": "Sam Darnold stood up to the old narratives about himself and proved to be a winner this NFL season. Now come the playoffs, and a chance to be great",
    "fullText": "The NFC now runs through the Seattle Seahawks, and a former USC Trojan quarterback led his team to an NFC West title and a first-round bye in the playoffs. Sam Darnold faced the same scenario last season as his Minnesota Vikings took on the Detroit Lions with the same stakes. Just like many other big games Sam Darnold has played in, he came up short last year, and he was a big reason for the loss versus the Lions. This time around, that was not the case.\n\nAs the starter for the Vikings, Sam Darnold in Week 18 last year had a statline of 18/41 for 166 yards through the air and no touchdowns or interceptions. Darnold was sacked two times, and the Detroit Lions made Darnold, who was an MVP candidate that season, look like a rookie. Against the 49ers Saturday night, Darnold still did not look like an MVP, but he did not have to. All that was asked of him was to take care of the football and play better than Brock Purdy. He did just that.\n\nDarnold was not the reason the Seahawks lost this game. He was still 20/26 and threw 198 yards passing. Darnold, in the moments he needed to deliver, he did, and it was always to his best target, Jaxon Smith-Njigba. This was not his best game by any means, but Darnold still stepped up and added another big game victory to his resume. He is killing old narratives that he can not win big games, as he proved that with his last two victories against division opponents.\n\nNobody expected this team to run away with this tough division and be in first place in the NFC. The Seahawks did that because they finally have their franchise quarterback and everything else this team needs to win. Darnold did not finish the season as an MVP candidate finalist, even though he was a name drawing consideration early in the season. He still finishes the year with 4,048 yards passing, 25 touchdowns, and a 67.7 completion percentage. Darnold was everything the Seahawks needed him to be this year.\n\nThe Seahawks look every bit like a Super Bowl contender and should be the favorite to come out of the NFC. The Seahawks defense stopped the hottest offense in the NFL to just 3 points, a week after they put up 42 points. The run game for Seattle was unstoppable, as Kenneth Walker ran for 97 yards and Zach Charbonnet ran for 74 yards and a touchdown. Sam Darnold was a game manager, but he has given this team confidence that when he needs to be elite, he can do that.\n\nThe NFC now runs through the 12th man, and no team in the NFC is looking forward to dealing with the Seahawks come playoff time. There are no longer any weaknesses on this team, and the days of betting on Sam Darnold to disappear in a clutch game are now over. If Sam Darnold plays just like he did last night, the Seahawks could very well win the Super Bowl.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: Sam Darnold wins another big game as Seahawks stand atop NFC",

    "fullText": "NFL coaches fired in 2026: Latest news on Mike Tomlin, John Harbaugh, others on Black Monday hot seat originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFourteen NFL teams are looking ahead to the playoffs, but for everyone else, it’s on to the offseason.\n\nBefore free agency and the draft take center stage, the coaching carousel will be the first to heat up. Just don’t expect it to be quite as busy as it was in 2024 or 2025.\n\nWhile the Tennessee Titans and New York Giants both made midseason coaching changes, the combination of back-to-back active cycles over the previous two years and late-season surges from a few teams with coaches on the hot seat could leave this January quieter than normal on the coaching front.\n\nThat doesn’t mean nothing will happen, though. Some coaches’ statuses remained up in the air in Week 18, and it wouldn’t be the NFL offseason without a surprise.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about every coach who might be on the hot seat.\n\nMORE:2025 Fantasy Football Awards\n\nThe Giants fired coach Brian Daboll on Nov. 10, after blowing yet another lead in a loss to the Chicago Bears a day earlier. New York gained momentum after benching Russell Wilson for Jaxson Dart in September, even knocking off the Eagles in a prime-time slot, but the Giants had a penchant for blowing leads this season, including a 19-point meltdown against the Denver Broncos. Daboll went 20-40-1 over less than four seasons in New York.\n\nAfter a dismal 1-5 start with their offense among the worst in the NFL, the Titans fired coach Brian Callahan in the middle of his second season. Tennessee resisted making Callahan a one-and-done coach in 2024, bringing him back after a 3-14 season and giving him the chance to develop No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward, but the Titans showed little improvement over the first six games of the season before Mike McCoy replaced Callahan on an interim basis. Callahan went 4-19 over 23 games in Nashville.\n\nMORE:NFL playoffs QB confidence meter\n\nLas Vegas Raiders coach Pete Carroll is at risk of going one-and-done in Las Vegas, according to multiple reports.“We’ll see if Pete Carroll is there for it. I doubt it, but we’ll see,” NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport said while discussing the Raiders’ outlook for the 2026 draft, reiterating other reports that claim the organization might want to clean house as a disastrous season comes to a close.\n\nHeading into Week 18, signs are pointing to the Pete Caroll era being one-and-done in Las Vegas. Insiders including CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones and NFL Network's Ian Rapoport believe that the Raiders are heading for a reset. Las Vegas welcomes in the defending AFC champions Kansas City Chiefs in Week 18.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter leans towards the Raiders moving on from Caroll after jsut one season. Schefter is calling it a failed \"experiment,\" and believes the Raiders will eat the final two years on his contract.\n\nFox's Jay Glazer also believes that Caroll will be out after one season as the Raiders' head coach.\n\nIf the Raiders make a change, they would be searching for their 13th full-time head coach in the last 25 years.\n\nThe future of Cleveland Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski has been the subject of much speculation, but reports haven't clarified whether he is more likely to stay or go. The two-time Coach of the Year suffered through an ugly 2024 season and likewise didn't come close to contending in 2025, though the Browns entered the year with low expectations and no clear answer at quarterback. Stefanski is hoping a gritty Week 17 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers will be enough to buy him a seventh season in Cleveland.\n\nAccording to CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones, Cleveland and Stefanski appear to be headed for a split. Jones details that \"At 43, Stefanski remains a young coach who is well thought of across the league, and few would be surprised if he winds up getting another head-coaching gig this cycle.\"\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter believes Stefanski will not be back to coach the Browns next season. Schefter also claims that Stefanski will be a highly sought-after coach with all the openings.\n\nMORE: The NFL's highest paid coaches in 2025\n\nAfter a four-win improvement in 2024, the hope was the Arizona Cardinals would make a playoff leap in 2025. Instead, they completely unraveled after a 2-0 start, losing 13 of their next 14 games and suffering five losses by margins of 20 points or more from November onward. While the Cardinals' major change could be moving on from Kyler Murray, which seems like a near certainty, it might be hard for Arizona to justify Gannon returning for a fourth season.\n\nThough, some believe that Gannon will return to Arizona in 2026. NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported that the general sense around Arizona is Gannon will be the head coach next season, \"this time with a QB that he’s involved in selecting along with GM Monti Ossenfort.\" However, owner Michael Bidwell hasn't made a firm decision yet.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter says that the feeling around the league is that Gannon will remain safe for next season. There is a strong belief that the Cardinals are moving on from Kyler Murray, and therefore, the owners want to give Gannon a chance to find his own quarterback.\n\nSteelers coach Mike Tomlin has still never had a losing season in nearly two decades in Pittsburgh, but the 2025 is shaping up to look much like 2024, whether they win the division or not. The Steelers have faded after an early hot start and taken a couple of surprise losses, including their Week 17 defeat at the hands of the Browns when they had a chance to clinch the AFC North. If the Steelers don't win the division, it will mean they finish one game worse than they did in 2024, before adding Aaron Rodgers, DK Metcalf, Jalen Ramsey and more. That doesn't necessarily mean the Steelers would fire Tomlin, but it could open the door for a mutual parting of ways, depending on what Tomlin is thinking.\n\nA report by Albert Breer suggested the Steelers already know who they would turn to if they part ways with Tomlin. Rams DC Chris Shula, grandson of Don Shula, would be the frontrunner for the job.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter reports there is a feeling that Tomlin will be back, at least to finish his contract. Conversations will still be had, but he's leaning towards being safe.\n\nFox's Jay Glazer believes that if Tomlin is not the coach for the Steelers next season, it would be his own doing. He does not think the Steelers would fire Tomlin.\n\nOn the other side of the Steelers-Ravens rivalry is John Harbaugh, who has done battle with Tomlin for 18 years. Even with Lamar Jackson's injuries playing a major role, the Ravens have to be disappointed with how the season has played out. Baltimore entered Week 17 under .500 and on the verge of elimination, though an AFC North title remains in play. After so much success with Jackson healthy in 2023 and 2024, the Ravens' likeliest path is to just try to reshape the roster as best they can for 2026, but Harbaugh's job status could come into question if frustration mounts.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter leans safe with Harbaugh, but thinks there should be more focus on this situation than on Tomlin's.\n\nAfter a 2-7 start to the season, Mike McDaniel and the Miami Dolphins have turned the season around, going 5-2 over the seven games leading into Week 18. That might've help save McDaniel's job, as McDaniel needed a strong finish to prove why he should remain in the role.\n\nThe Dolphins will be looking for a new general manager in the offseason after firing Chris Grier, so it's possible that hire will help decide McDaniel's fate. However, NFL Network reports that McDaniel will likely return for a fifth season.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter is also leaning towards McDaniel being safe for the time being.\n\nAdam Schefter on ESPN:\n\n“The feeling of owners right now is (the Dolphins) prefer to keep (Mike McDaniel). It doesn’t mean that he’s going to be safe. But we are leaning safe today. If they were making a decision today (he) is back. But there will be conversations in the…\n\n— Joe Schad (@schadjoe) January 4, 2026\n\nThe Atlanta Falcons seemed to he headed toward a change after spiraling to 4-9 despite entering the season with realistic playoff hopes. Are three consecutive wins enough to save Raheem Morris' job? On one hand, the Falcons have proven Morris has kept the team focused and playing hard even after being eliminated. On the other hand, the late-season run is a reminder of what could have been in a winnable NFC South and raises questions about why Morris couldn't get results against divisional opponents.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter leans safe, believing Morris saved his job given how the Falcons have finished the season.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers' late-season collapse has led some to wonder whether coach Todd Bowles could be on the hot seat. According to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, he isn't likely to be fired. \"They've won three-straight division titles and still have a possibility of winning their fourth. Does that sound like someone who should be in trouble? I'd say certainly not,\" Rapoport said. If the Buccaneers miss the playoffs, though, it might be hard for the organization to ignore questions about the fourth-year coach's status.\n\nThough, with the Buccaneers extending Bowles in the offseason, CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones reported that it seems unlikely Tampa Bay fires the head coach, who has a 34-33 record entering a must-win Week 18 contest against the Carolina Panthers.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter reports that the Buccaneers do not want to make a coaching change, and the belief is that Bowles is safe.\n\nIt's easy to blame Joe Burrow's injury for the Cincinnati Bengals' failures in 2025, but the team still lost winnable games with and without their star losing to the New York Jets without Burrow and getting shut out by the Ravens with him. Still, reports indicate that isn't likely to cost Zac Taylor his job, and back-to-back blowout wins leading into Week 18 indicate the typically loyal Bengals will stick with their head coach for a seventh season with hopes Burrow can stay healthy in 2026.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter says that quarterback Joe Burrow is a believer in Taylor and that the Bengals are not expected to move on.\n\nMORE: Revisiting Aaron Glenn’s playing career\n\nOne-and-done head coaches have become a bit more common in the NFL over the past decade, so speculation about Aaron Glenn's job status has bubbled up among fans as the New York Jets have limped to the finish line. While New York doesn't have much talent on the field with Garrett Wilson and two quarterbacks injured plus two core defensive pieces traded away, tangible progress has been hard to find for Gang Green. That still isn't expected to cost Glenn his job. Fox Sports' Jay Glazer declared, \"he'll be safe,\" when discussing Glenn's status in Week 17, and owner Woody Johnson, for all his flaws, isn't known to be too volatile with coaches.\n\nNFL Network's Ian Rapoport believes the same when it comes to Glenn, saying \"the Jets are bringing back Aaron Glenn for a second season as head coach. The question is, how significant will changes be to his staff?\"\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter shares this same belief and reports that the Jets are committed to Glenn despite the struggles.\n\nFox's Jay Glazer firmly claims that Glenn is safe for next season.\n\nIt might seem surprising to see an accomplished and respected head coach such as Sean McDermott in the conversation of potential firings. However, despite the regular-season success and a good record in Buffalo, playoff success ultimately threatens McDermott's future.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter labels McDermott as safe, but if Buffalo loses in the playoffs, the belief is that conversations would be had about potentially firing McDermott.\n\nIt's been a drastic turn of events for everyone in Indianapolis. After a successful start this season, the Colts were considered potential Super Bowl contenders. However, this was before losing Daniel Jones to a season-ending injury. Since Jones went down in Week 14, the Colts have not won a game.\n\nWhile ESPN's Adam Schefter says Steichen is leaning toward being safe, he also claims the Colts' owners have not spoken on it.\n\nWhile there are no major rumors of Matt LaFleur getting fired, his job security continues to be questioned weekly. Depending on how the season ends for the Packers, it will provide a clearer picture of LaFleur's future.\n\nFox's Jay Glazer places Lafleur in the \"time will tell\" category and believes it would be crazy for the Packers to move on.",

Cleveland and the Ravens made the playoffs several times, but were never able to make the Super Bowl during his time in Baltimore.\n\nThe 6-foot-6, 350-pound offensive lineman appeared in 64 games during his time with Baltimore, but he primarily played as a backup or on special teams. Cleveland will look for a new NFL home. In Feb. 2025, Cleveland was arrested for driving under the influence.\n\nCleveland's combination of size and NFL experience means that he should find a new NFL suitor.

    "fullText": "Even the New York Jets' very own fans could not have envisioned the NFL history that could take place today against the Buffalo Bills. Whether you're pessimistic or optimistic, it's definitely not the good kind of history either.\n\nThe Jets will play the Bills at 4:25 P.M. today, and if they do not get an interception against Josh Allen, they will have gone through the entire season without getting a pick against an opposing quarterback. Making them the first team in NFL history to do so.\n\nThe projected starters this week do not necessarily have a history of turning the ball over, as the starters against the Bills have accounted for only 11 turnovers across their careers. Interceptions have been a bit of a foreign concept for the New York Jets for several years, but to go an entire season without having an interception is definitely something worth noting.\n\nThis offseason, the Jets will not focus solely on defense. Still, the franchise is aware of the shortcomings in competing in the NFL: being physical, playing fast, and forcing turnovers will be a priority in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: New York Jets are on the brink of history, and not the good kind",

    "fullText": "We have elevated DT Ricky Barber and WR River Cracraft from the practice squad pic.twitter.com/LnFS6NHTYI\n\n— Washington Commanders (@Commanders) January 3, 2026\n\nKingsbury will be a hot name this offseason despite having a down year for the Commanders, but will he actually leave? He’s already been linked to the Tennessee Titans and Las Vegas Raiders job as a fit, but what about going to a division rival? ESPN’s Jordan Raanan said the Giants will cast a wide net in their head coaching search, but Kingsbury might be on the outside looking in.\n\n“Commanders’ offensive coordinator Kingsbury, who also has experience as an NFL head coach with the Cardinals, is considered a bright offensive mind. The question is if he’s the right fit for the New York market.” – Jordan Raanan, ESPN\n\nThe Giants interview list includes Mike McCarthy, Chris Shula, Antonio Pierce and more as they cast a wide net. https://t.co/o2weOafxQt\n\n— Jordan Raanan (@JordanRaanan) January 2, 2026\n\nIt would be a surprise if Kingsbury doesn’t even get an interview with the Giants, given his track record with young quarterbacks, and what he could do with Jaxson Dart. It sounds like they could be interested in Kingsbury, but he’s likely more of a tier two or tier three candidate for the Giants.\n\nThe former TCU standout is getting a look down the stretch with Tunsil out. Coleman looks more accomplished and urgent in everything he does. He is not the finished article by any stretch of the imagination, but his upturn in consistency indicates that all hope is not lost just yet.\n\nThis hasn’t gone unnoticed by Quinn. The coach thinks Coleman has learned a great deal in his second campaign. The athletic upside has always been there, but the lineman has developed a new sense of resilience that is standing him in exceptional stead.\n\n“I think…he has learned a lot here in year two. This is a resilient guy that can do a lot of things based on his athleticism, him learning and going through the hard moments.”Dan Quinn via Commanders.com\n\nColeman will start at left tackle again in Week 18 against the Philadelphia Eagles if he gets the all-clear to participate. He’s listed as questionable with a knee problem, but he practiced in full on Friday. That’s a positive sign, which gives him a fighting chance of finishing his campaign on a high note.\n\nThe Commanders elevated Cracraft from the practice squad to the active roster Saturday ahead of Sunday’s game against the Eagles. Cracraft has been elevated for consecutive weeks, finishing Christmas Day’s loss against the Cowboys with just one snap on the special-teams unit. With Terry McLaurin, Deebo Samuel, Treylon Burks and Chris Moore all healthy and active, Cracraft is likely in line to see the same minimal special-teams snap share in Sunday’s game.\n\n1) What were your big takeaways from the Week 16 matchup between the Commanders and Eagles?\n\nI do think it’s silly how the Commanders took such offense to the Eagles going for two late in the game. Why wait until then to show that kind of fight? Also, laughable to hear Dan Quinn talk tough about how Washington was going to see the Eagles again in two weeks. When it seemed like the Eagles will be resting their starters, which we now know is exactly the case. For Quinn to be afraid of going for it on fourth down (punted on 4th-and-4 from the minus 40-yard line down 11 with 9 minutes to go … and punted on 4th-and-6 from the minus 44-yard line down 11 with just 6:44 to go) and then act all tough in the postgame presser? That’s unserious behavior to me.\n\n2) How far do you think the Eagles will get in the post-season and what do you think will be their biggest secret to success or stumbling block?\n\nI think the Eagles can win the Super Bowl. Vic Fangio’s defense is awesome. Jalen Hurts has played well in the biggest games of his career. There is no juggernaut the Eagles simply can’t beat.\n\nDo you expect the Commanders will try especially hard this week or are they going to pack it in and rest key players with an eye to the 2026 season? How do fans want the team to approach this game?\n\nI don’t know that the Commanders will try especially hard to win, but they will certainly try as hard to win as they did in the last matchup (where the playoffs were already out of reach). Reports are that Dan Quinn still has the locker room, the players are still bought in, and the coaches and players still want to win games. So I’m sure they’ll try their hardest to win, just like last time, but the deck will be stacked against them due to all their injuries.\n\nThe decision to rest or play starters is not just about protecting players or gaining draft position, it’s also about putting together some good tape so the front office can actually evaluate the talent on the team. So many players have been injured or are returning from injury, so many players have been moved to different positions or roles (particularly on defense) due to injuries and due to Dan Quinn taking over the defense a few weeks ago, that it’s probably more important for the front office to get additional tape on these players playing their best in order to evaluate them than it is to get a slightly higher draft spot. What good does a better draft pick do if you can’t even evaluate your biggest team needs effectively? For this reason, as well as for pride and division rivalry, I think most fans will be rooting for the starters to play and the team to play well. In my opinion, the only reason to tank is if you need a top 2 pick for a QB, quality players at other positions can be found later in the draft.\n\nTampa Bay’s 16-14 win over the Panthers keeps it alive, but now the Bucs need the Saints to beat the Falcons to make the postseason.\n\nthe showdown game for first place in the NFC South did not yield a division winner, at least not yet.\n\nSo it went on the opening day of the final weekend of the NFL’s regular season. The Seahawks beat the San Francisco 49ers in Santa Clara, California, to secure the NFC West title and the conference’s No. 1 playoff seed. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the Carolina Panthers but will have to wait until Sunday to see whether that will be enough for them to win the NFC South.\n\nThe playoff field is taking shape and will be fully formed when Sunday’s play is done.\n\nThe Buccaneers helped their postseason cause. But they didn’t punch their playoff ticket, at least not yet.\n\nThe opening game of the final weekend of the NFL’s regular season did not determine as much as it could have. The Buccaneers beat the Panthers, 16-14, in the rain Saturday at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa. But they will have to wait until Sunday to find out whether they will secure their fifth straight NFC South title and the NFC’s No. 4 playoff seed.\n\nThey need the Atlanta Falcons to lose Sunday to the New Orleans Saints. If the Falcons beat the Saints, that would create a three-way tie for the division lead with matching 8-9 records. The Panthers would win the division in that case, based on tiebreakers.\n\n“We did everything we could today,” Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield told ESPN afterward. “Sit back and see what happens tomorrow.”\n\nThe final show@BankofAmerica | #RaiseHail pic.twitter.com/UoGpgmFVLs\n\n— Washington Commanders (@Commanders) January 4, 2026\n\nCommanders edge rusher Von Miller needs one sack Sunday vs. the Eagles to finish the season with nine sacks and collect another $500,000 in incentives. pic.twitter.com/eDSPxZ9Lls\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 4, 2026\n\nCommanders WR Deebo Samuel has $650,000 on the line Sunday vs. the Eagles.

    "fullText": "\"Sunday Night Football\" brought us one of the games of the year in Week 17.\n\nThe host San Francisco 49ers and Chicago Bears traded blows throughout all four quarters in a dazzling offensive display. It's the third week in a row in which the final game of the Sunday slate was a one-score affair; the 49ers' 42-38 win is the latest following the Patriots' 28-24 win in Week 16 over the Ravens and the Vikings' 34-26 win over the Cowboys.\n\nTeams have put on a show all season in prime time for a national audience. All 32 teams will be in action this weekend, the final week of the regular season; every contest is a division matchup.\n\nWill that slate include one more prime time matchup to cap off Sunday's action? Here's what to know.\n\nYes, there is a \"Sunday Night Football\" game in Week 18. It's a high-stakes divisional matchup to boot: the Baltimore Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers face off to decide who wins the AFC North.\n\nPittsburgh could've made things tougher for the Ravens by winning in Week 17 over last-placed Cleveland. Instead, the Steelers' offense stumbled, and the Browns won 13-6. That result and the Ravens' win over the Packers a day earlier set up a winner-takes-all Week 18 matchup.\n\nWhichever team wins on \"Sunday Night Football\" will win the AFC North title and earn the No. 4 seed in the AFC playoffs.\n\nHere's a look back at the full slate of Sunday night games this year.

    "description": "Will the Falcons keep head coach Raheem Morris and GM Terry Fontenot? NFL insiders weigh in",
    "fullText": "The Atlanta Falcons were supposed to turn the corner with head coach Raheem Morris at the helm, but it's been nearly two full seasons and they have yet to take that next step. Morris is 15-18 overall entering Sunday's season finale against the New Orleans Saints.\n\nAfter winning three straight games, though, Morris' seat seems to have cooled down considerably. While the team has already been eliminated from playoff contention, the Falcons' recent winning streak has shaken up the NFC South division race.\n\nIf Atlanta wins on Sunday, the Carolina Panthers will NFC South champs. If the Falcons lose, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers will clinch their fifth straight division title. But will a late-season winning streak be enough for Morris to save his job?\n\nAs we approach another Black Monday, NFL insiders have been gathering intel on each coaching situation. Let's see what those around the league are hearing about Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot.\n\nAccording to Dianna Russini of The Athletic, Falcons owner Arthur Blank is expected to bring in a consulting firm to evaluate everything. Russini even suggested that the team may keep Morris and move on from Fontenot in the offseason.\n\nThat work is expected to be weighed alongside the organization’s internal evaluations: two seasons (and a 15-18 record) under coach Raheem Morris, five seasons under Fontenot, how this year has unfolded, the perceived state of the roster and the franchise’s overall team-building approach. Many around the league expect the Falcons to move on from Fontenot and stick with Morris as coach. One potential added voice to the mix? Former quarterback Matt Ryan, who is in talks to return to the organization in a front-office role. -- Dianna Russini, The Athletic\n\nESPN's Jeremy Fowler also put out a feature discussing NFL coaches on the hot seat. Fowler said the Falcons haven't given up on Morris, but Arthur Blank clearly wanted to see more from the team over the last two years.\n\nThe Falcons have not quit on Morris, who has railed off three consecutive wins to make his case for a third year in Atlanta. But that doesn't ensure his return. Morris would most likely need to make staff changes if he does stay. Special teams has been a bugaboo, and quarterback Michael Penix Jr.'s development hasn't proceeded as hoped. -- Jeremy Fowler, ESPN\n\nOver at NFL.com, Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero released a new hot-seat breakdown. The Falcons have been a disappointment, but it sounds like Morris may have bought himself some goodwill with that upset win over the Rams.\n\nAnd for as disappointing as the Falcons were even a month ago, they’ve found a spark down the stretch, playing hard for head coach Raheem Morris and winning three games in a row with formerly demoted veteran Kirk Cousins at quarterback. The reason owners wait to see the entire product is to learn how a team responds to adversity. And with all eyes on them, Atlanta beat the Los Angeles Rams on national TV on Monday night. It gives Blank a lot to think about as he weighs the futures of Morris, who has three years left on his contract, and GM Terry Fontenot, who has one. -- Ian Rapoport & Tom Pelissero, NFL.com\n\nThe Falcons will close out the season against the Saints at 1 p.m. on Sunday afternoon. Once the team makes a decision on Morris and Fontenot, it will be on to free agency for Atlanta. Some key players, including tight end Kyle Pitts and linebacker Kaden Elliss, will be free agents.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Falcons Wire: Atlanta Falcons: NFL insiders on Raheem Morris' job status",

It is a merciful close to a merciless season, one in which splendor and delight turns to wickedness as losses pile up. Their titles lose their luster upon the conclusion of the year, while they prepare for hibernation during a brisk winter and spring.\n\nEven in the dark, though, there is light. Because the league's worst sides are rewarded with a rather remarkable platform — draft picks.\n\nWhile those atop the NFL standings are jostling for postseason seeding, a similarly contentious battle is taking place in the cellar. The Raiders, Giants, Jets, Titans and Cardinals all sit at the bottom of the league standings, meaning they'll land a crown jewel of sorts in terms of draft position.\n\nWhile that's not a guaranteed indicator of success, it can prove consequential. Sides like the Patriots, Seahawks and Broncos all built through the draft, crafting Super Bowl-caliber rosters one pick at a time.\n\nSo, just what does the NFL Draft order look like after Week 18?

They're not the only players tabbed for success at the big-league level, however.\n\nThere are a handful of defenders whose names have sparkled on scouting reports across the league, led by Miami EDGE Rueben Bain Jr., Texas Tech EDGE David Bailey and Ohio State stars Arvell Reese and Caleb Downs.\n\nFurther down the board, there are a few skill players garnering interest. Carnell Tate is making waves despite struggling with injuries in his junior year, while Notre Dame's Jeremiyah Love and Arizona State's Jordyn Tyson have been tipped for brilliance at the big-league level. Suffice to say, there should be plenty of talent on display when Roger Goodell steps to the stage in Pittsburgh come April.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers have ruled the NFC South for several years now.\n\nThe New Orleans Saints won the division in 2020, but the Bucs have won it in each season since then. The team looked to be coasting toward another title in 2025 after a 5-1 start to the season.\n\nHowever, since that point, the team has gone just 3-8. As a result of that horrendous run, Bucs fans are getting antsy.\n\nLuckily, the Bucs ended their regular season with a win over the Carolina Panthers on Saturday. If the Panthers would have won, they would've clinched the NFC South and knocked the Bucs out of postseason contention.\n\nEven though the Bucs won, though, they still need some help. The New Orleans Saints have to beat the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday for the Bucs to clinch the division. If the Falcons win, the Bucs, Panthers, and Falcons will all finish with 8-9 records and the Panthers get the crown.\n\nIf the Falcons win and the Bucs miss the playoffs, are head coach Todd Bowles and general manager Jason Licht in trouble? One NFL insider provided an update on that front Saturday.\n\nAccording to Russini, the Bucs historically prefer to wait until the end of the season before making personnel decisions. It would definitely be disappointing to miss the playoffs, but Russini doesn't think either man is in danger.\n\n“Coach Todd Bowles and general manager Jason Licht, who both signed multiyear extensions in June, have won division titles each of the last three seasons and appear to be safe even if the Bucs miss the playoffs,\" Russini explained.\n\nBowles took over as the head coach of the Bucs ahead of the 2022 season. The Bucs have made the playoffs in each of his seasons so far, and the coach has a 34-33 overall record.\n\nBowles didn't inherit the best situation either, as the roster dealt with a ton of turnover after Tom Brady's retirement. Still, the team has won the NFC South in each of Bowles' seasons.\n\nThe Bucs will undoubtedly be glued to the TV on Sunday to see if they are going to be playing in the postseason again. Regardless, it seems like the head coach and general manager will be around for at least one more season.\n\nDolphins predicted to cut star wide receiver in 2026\n\nCardinals predicted to replace Kyler Murray with 2026 rookie\n\nGiants predicted to add elite weapon for Jaxson Dart\n\nRussell Wilson posts cryptic message among bad season\n\nSteelers predicted to replace Aaron Rodgers with college star\n\nPete Carroll predicted to be one-and-done with Raiders",

In that case, they’ll play either the Eagles or the Bears to kick off the postseason, and I think it goes without saying that the 5-seed is the better option here.\n\nHere are the updated standings before Saturday’s games kick off in Week 18.\n\n1.

    "fullText": "Baker Mayfield and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers held off Carolina 16-14 on Saturday to keep their playoff hopes alive to the bitter end of the NFL season.\n\nThe victory prevented the Panthers from locking up the NFC's last post-season berth and leaves both teams anxiously watching Sunday's results to learn which one progresses.\n\nTampa Bay edged an error-strewn, rain-soaked clash, taking an early lead and relying on cautious tactics and multiple field goals to cling on.\n\n\"We just found a way to win right there -- tough divisional opponent, and we did everything we could today,\" said Bucs' quarterback Mayfield.\n\n\"Sit back and see what happens tomorrow,\" said Mayfield, who threw for a touchdown, completing 16-of-22 attempted passes for 203 yards.\n\nDespite both teams ending the regular season with an 8-9 losing record, one of them is still guaranteed to win the historically weak NFC South division and reach the playoffs.\n\nWhether the Bucs or the Panthers advance now depends on the outcome of a clash between two teams with no hope of reaching the playoffs -- the Atlanta Falcons and the New Orleans Saints.\n\nTampa Bay, who have won the NFC South for the past four years and started this season well before imploding, will be rooting for the bottom-placed but in-form Saints.\n\nMeanwhile, Carolina must rely on inconsistent Atlanta. If the Falcons win, a three-way tie atop the NFC South at 8-9 would see the Panthers edge through on head-to-head results.\n\nTampa Bay scored on the game's opening drive, as tight end Cade Otton belatedly caught his first touchdown of the season, and the Bucs soon added a field goal.\n\nBut following an intercepted Baker Mayfield pass, a wide-open Tommy Tremble grabbed a Panthers touchdown with a clever, mazy run.\n\nWith torrential downpours hampering both sides, another interception -- this time off Carolina's Bryce Young -- set up another Bucs field goal for a 13-7 half-time lead.\n\nRain eased in the second half, but not before kicker Ryan Fitzgerald slipped to miss a 54-yard Panthers field goal attempt.\n\nNerves grew among the home crowd as Tampa Bay adopted ultra-cautious tactics to protect a slender lead.\n\nBut favorable decisions by officials -- a missed penalty, plus two pass interference calls -- helped Tampa Bay reach a 16-7 lead in the fourth quarter.\n\nAfter yet another rain-soaked Panthers fumble, and a blocked Tampa Bay field goal attempt, Jalen Coker caught an eight-yard touchdown with just over two minutes remaining to bring Carolina hope.\n\nBut the Buccaneers held on. A grinning Mayfield said he will now learn if his season will continue into the playoffs \"from my own couch.\"",

    "description": "Tampa Bay's 16-14 defeat of the Carolina Panthers means the NFC South title will be decided on the NFL regular season's final day.",
    "fullText": "The NFL runs a risk every May when its schedule comes out – hoping those “TBD” slots it reserves for the Saturday of Week 18 ultimately get filled by games worthy of the standalone broadcast windows.\n\nJan. 3 provided further proof that the league knows what it’s doing – serving up a pair of matchups with massive postseason stakes. And even then, the schedule makers got another win – the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ 16-14 defeat of the Carolina Panthers actually failing to decide the NFC South title (more on that later).\n\nThat won’t be the case Saturday night, when the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks will definitively decide who wins the NFC West and the conference’s No. 1 overall playoff seed.\n\nBut, for now, here are the winners, losers – and otherwise – from Saturday’s games:\n\nThe Bucs and Panthers now knotted with 8-9 records, the winner of the division is still unknown. In a vacuum, Tampa Bay owns the common-games tiebreaker that puts the team in its near-perennial spot atop the division. But if the Falcons create a three-way tie by winning Sunday, Carolina would get the tiebreaker by virtue of a 3-1 mark against the Falcons and Bucs, eclipsing the other two teams.\n\nStill undefeated. The footing at Tampa's Raymond James Stadium was bad, and it was evident as players slipped, kicks were affected, and the general quality of play was impacted in such a critical game.\n\nThe home of “Monday Night Football” continues to enjoy an expanded presence late in the season, broadcasting both of Saturday’s consequential duels with another to come during the wild-card round of the playoffs. A year from now, ESPN will have the Super Bowl for the first time – though it will be simulcast on ABC. And Disney’s NFL footprint is only likely to continue growing ahead of its pending deal to acquire NFL Network, RedZone Channel and other media assets owned and controlled by the NFL, the crossover between the entities already readily apparent.\n\nHey, a team eliminated from postseason contention weeks ago now has something tangible to play for Sunday in its finale against the New Orleans Saints. Not only might a season-ending four-game winning streak save this coaching staff but knocking off the Bucs in the process would be especially sweet.\n\nThe Carolina running back, who ran for nearly 1,100 yards in 2024 for the Dallas Cowboys but was grossly undervalued by them and the free agent market has essentially matched that figure this season and earned a $1 million bonus Saturday by reaching 1,350 yards from scrimmage. Dowdle, who signed a $2.75 million contract with the Panthers before the season – and prior to hitting his incentive Saturday and others previously – should see a lot more green on the market a few months from now.\n\nIn what might have been the 14-year veteran's final game – or at least the linebacker's last one with the Bucs, his contract set to expire after the season – he recorded six stops Saturday to tie Hall of Famer Derrick Brooks as the most prolific tackler in franchise history.\n\nWith Carolina set up in the Bucs’ red zone early in the fourth quarter and trailing by nine, Dowdle slipped while tossing the ball back to QB Bryce Young on an apparent flea flicker. Fumble … and pretty much game, set and match. Tampa Bay didn't actually convert the turnover into points but did burn nearly six precious minutes off the clock before getting a field-goal try blocked. (Regardless, Dowdle still gets to keep his milli.)\n\nFUMBLE! The @Buccaneers jump on the loose ball 😤\n\nCARvsTB on ESPN/ABC\nStream on @NFLPlus and ESPN App pic.twitter.com/T7Pln5ymPn\n\nWhether it was the lateral that was prematurely blown dead − though the officials still moved the Panthers back 7 yards − or the dubious offensive pass interference against Tetairoa McMillan, which wiped out his 32-yard reception, the zebras were especially unkind to Carolina as it tried to whittle down a 13-6 halftime deficit.\n\nKicking off Saturday without injured starters – especially studs like all-universe LT Trent Williams and WR1 Ricky Pearsall – was hardly an ideal way to take on the mighty Seahawks defense with so much hanging in the balance.\n\nAll NFL news on and off the field. \n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: NFC South playoff spot up for grabs after Bucs top Panthers",

    "fullText": "Kansas City (6-10) at Las Vegas (2-14)\n\nAgainst the spread: Chiefs 6-10, Raiders 6-10.\n\nSeries record: Chiefs lead 76-55-2.\n\nLast meeting: Chiefs beat Raiders 31-0 on Oct. 19 at Kansas City.\n\nLast week: Chiefs lost to the Broncos 20-13; Raiders lost to the Giants 34-10.\n\nChiefs offense: overall (17), rush (23), pass (13), scoring (20).\n\nChiefs defense: overall (10), rush (10), pass (13), scoring (6).\n\nRaiders offense: overall (32), rush (32), pass (27), scoring (32).\n\nRaiders defense: overall (16), rush (18), pass (15), scoring (25).\n\nTurnover differential: Chiefs minus-1; Raiders minus-7.\n\nQB Chris Oladokun was forced into the starting role two weeks ago in Tennessee, when Gardner Minshew followed Patrick Mahomes by tearing ligaments in his knee. He then had to prepare for his first NFL start on Christmas night on just three days' notice, and wound up throwing for just 66 yards. Expect a better performance with 10 days to prepare for this one.\n\nQBs Kenny Pickett and Aidan O'Connell. With Geno Smith dealing with a significant ankle injury, coach Pete Carroll said he expected both to play. Each will have a chance to show that the Raiders should bring him back next season or for one of the other 31 clubs to take notice.\n\nRaiders RB Ashton Jeanty vs. Chiefs defensive front. This hasn't been the kind of season Jeanty envisioned, but he is 112 yards from 1,000. He might have trouble reaching that milestone against a Chiefs defense that ranks 10th in allowing 104.9 yards per game. But Kansas City has given up 409 yards rushing in missed tackles, according to Next Gen Stats. Jeanty has gained 350 yards after breaking tackles, so he might have a chance.\n\nChiefs: RG Trey Smith (ankle) is unlikely to play. The Chiefs already have OTs Jawaan Taylor, Wanya Morris and Josh Simmons on injured reserve, along with Mahomes, Minshew, CBs Trent McDuffie Chris Roland-Wallace and Jaylen Watson, LB Leo Chenal and WRs Rashee Rice, Nikko Remigio and Tyquan Thornton.\n\nRaiders: QB Geno Smith (ankle) likely won't play. ... DT Adam Butler (bicep) wasn’t as seriously hurt as feared and could play. ... LT Kolton Miller (ankle) likely won’t play.\n\nThe Chiefs have won the past three meetings, six of seven and 11 of 13. ... Kansas City has never lost in Las Vegas. The Chiefs are 5-0 against the Raiders at Allegiant Stadium, and KC defeated San Francisco in the Super Bowl two seasons ago. ... The Chiefs and Raiders have met in three playoff games with Kansas City winning two of them.\n\nKansas City has lost five straight and seven of its past nine. ... The Chiefs are assured of their first losing season since 2012, the year before Andy Reid took over as coach. They went 2-14 that season under Romeo Crennel. ... Kansas City has had 272 yards of offense combined over the past two weeks. It has not eclipsed 275 yards in any of its past four games. ... Chiefs TE Travis Kelce needs 46 yards receiving to reach 13,000 for his career. He has caught a pass in 189 consecutive games, the longest active streak in the NFL and longest streak in franchise history. ... DT Chris Jones needs one sack to tie Neil Smith (85 1/2) for third most in Chiefs history. ... The Raiders have lost 10 consecutive games, tied with a skid last season for the fifth-longest skid in franchise history. Another defeat would tie for the third longest which was set in the 2005-06 and 2006-07 seasons. The Raiders' longest losing streaks were 19 games in the 1961-62 seasons and 16 in 2013-14. ... Las Vegas' losing streak is the longest active one in the NFL. ... The Raiders have a point differential of minus-193, worst in the NFL. ... Their average point different is minus-12.1 per game. If it doesn't improve, that will be the highest since the 2020 New York Jets finished with a minus-13.4 average. ... RB Ashton Jeanty is one of two rookies ever with at least 800 yards rushing, five rushing touchdowns and five receiving TDs. The other is Hall of Famer Gale Sayers in 1965. ... LB Devin White's 168 tackles are second to Miami's Jordyn Brooks, who has 174. ... ... The Raiders have held opponents to zero or negative yards on 95 rushing plays, tied with Minnesota for best in the league. ... A victory would give Las Vegas coach Pete Carroll 173 for his career, which would move him into a tie for 16th with Jeff Fisher. Carroll is currently tied with Bill Parcells.\n\nThe Chiefs defense might be worth a look given the Raiders offensive struggles. They have failed to reach 30 points a franchise-worst 36 straight regular-season games.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "description": "Colts veteran defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo should be no stranger to upcoming open head coaching interviews.",
    "fullText": "According to ESPN’s Jordan Raanan, Indianapolis Colts veteran defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo is among the initial top interview candidates for the New York Giants current head coaching vacancy:\n\n“The first assignment is to find a new head coach. The Giants fired Brian Daboll almost eight weeks ago and named Mike Kafka the interim head coach,” writes Ranaan.\n\n“The team had a head start on compiling a list of candidates that includes former NFL head coach Mike McCarthy, Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley, Colts defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo, former Raiders coach and Giants player Antonio Pierce and Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula, among others. Kafka will also be given an interview.”\n\nWhoever is ultimately hired in New York will replace Brian Daboll, who coached the Giants from 2022-25.\n\nIt’s not the first time that Anarumo has been linked to an NFL head coaching opening, as he’s previously been connected in-season as a top candidate for the Tennessee Titans vacancy through multiple league reports respectively.\n\nNicknamed the “Mad Scientist,” the 59-year-old veteran defensive coordinator has been lauded for his ability to tailor his defensive gameplans weekly to stopping the opposing competition, even giving the likes of Kansas City Chiefs superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes some trouble in the past among other elite quarterbacks.\n\nIn his debut campaign with the Colts, there’s no question that Anarumo has been a significant upgrade to his Colts veteran defensive coordinator predecessor Gus Bradley.\n\nWhen healthy and going right, the Colts had a formidable unit this season.\n\nThat being said, after losing arguably the defense’s three best players down the season’s late stretch due to key injuries, namely to DeForest Buckner, Sauce Gardner, and Charvarius Ward, the Colts defense has since fallen on some hard times to close out this season. It no longer recently resembles the Top 10 defensive unit that it was for the majority of the 2025 campaign because of the loss of its best players.\n\nIt’s hard to win on defense in the NFL without your horses. Much less, there’s personnel issues with the Colts lack of consistent outside pass rush that go beyond Anarumo and key injuries down the final stretch.\n\nAnarumo has paid his coaching dues, has a track record of success, and is deserving of strong consideration for any NFL head coaching opening this upcoming offseason. However, it would be a real shame if he only gets to coach the Colts defense for one season. To me, he’s a top candidate to return in Indianapolis as defensive coordinator even in the rare case that Colts head coach Shane Steichen surprisingly doesn’t.\n\nGiven that we really didn’t see this unit fully together healthy upon Gardner’s arrival, Anarumo’s coaching best is still theoretically yet to come in Indianapolis—if we even get to see it again.",

    "title": "Drake Maye Could be the NFL MVP",
    "description": "It’s seemingly a race between him and Matthew Stafford, but just reaching this point is amazing for the UNC alum",
    "fullText": "After the 2024 draft, if you could have laid money down on which quarterback of the trio of Caleb Williams, Jayden Daniels, and Drake Maye would win the NFL MVP first, you probably would have gotten some long odds on Maye.\n\nOf the three, he was considered the biggest “project” going into the NFL. Those odds, if anything, seemed longer after the Washington Commanders invested heavily in their team going into the 2024 season and Daniels was able to take his team to the NFC Title game, losing to the eventual champ Philadelphia Eagles. Meanwhile, the Patriots were still suffering from the malaise at the end of the Bill Belichick era as first-year coach Jerod Mayo struggled to find any traction, and while Maye had showed some promise he ended his season on the sidelines as the Patriots tried — and failed — to get the number one overall pick for 2025.\n\nSo the deck seemed stacked for Maye to have an ascendent season. Mayo was out right after that last game, and Maye didn’t really provide much comment to reporters when the season concluded. In came Mike Vrabel as the head coach and Josh McDaniels as the offensive coordinator. The Patriots made moves in the offseason, but staring at being in the same division as the Buffalo Bills and 2024 MVP Josh Allen, the vibe for the team going into 2025 was hoping to use an easier schedule to finish above .500 and build toward having a consistent team for the first time in years.\n\nAfter a start that seemed to be what people were expecting, Maye had a signature game against Allen and the Bills in front of a national audience in Buffalo. It was enough to where Mike Tirico and Cris Collinsworth were calling for respect to be given to Maye and the offense, and included a game-winning field goal drive. That game was one of a ten-game winning streak for New England, and during that stretch highlight after highlight would pop on social media.\n\nMaye and the Patriots stumbled against the Bills after the bye and were again on Sunday Night Football, this time against Baltimore. By this point talk had gotten loud of Maye being the NFL MVP, but his loss to Buffalo seemingly ceded the title to the Rams’ Matthew Stafford. That week, though, things seemingly flipped back in Maye’s favor. First off, the other seeming contender in Matthew Stafford lost a close game to Seattle on Thursday Night and ceded control of the division to the Seahawks. Then on Sunday, Maye delivered yet another signature performance that included an 11-point fourth-quarter comeback, 380 yards in the air, two touchdowns, and a game-clinching run after the defense helped give the team a chance.\n\nEdge of our seats 🤯 pic.twitter.com/oVUiYbocXZ\n\n— z – New England Patriots (@Patriots) December 23, 2025\n\nMaye followed that up this past weekend with a foot-on-the-throat approach that showed he and the Patriots may have found another gear.\n\nDrake Maye MVP level performance was legendary against the #Jets\n\nFirst QB to ever have 90% completion percentage, 250+ yards and 5 TDS.#NEPats \n\n pic.twitter.com/DNAGtE3U2r\n\n— NFL Numbers Guy (@NFLNumbersGuy) December 29, 2025\n\nMatthew Stafford followed by losing to the Atlanta Falcons on the road and now all of a sudden, Drake Maye is the betting favorite to win the MVP. He would be the first Tar Heel alum to do so since Lawrence Taylor in 1986.\n\nAll of this is bittersweet for UNC fans. Earlier in the week on 98.5 The Sports Hub, a host during drive time was recounting this historic rise and mused “he’s obviously so talented you look at those years at North Carolina and wonder how they didn’t win more.” Fans likely felt that disturbance in the force and screamed “MACK BROWN, PHIL LONGO, AND CHIP LINDSEY!” Those that watched those amazing two years of Maye under center could see the talent, the skill and know that the combination of inept coaching on defense and some lack of support on offense really kept Maye from achieving the heights he should have.\n\nStill, it’s a source of pride for UNC fans that had to hear in the lead-up to the draft about how Maye was the weakest of the top three. Those that watched knew, and there’s a delicious irony that the former Patriots and current UNC coach likely wouldn’t have taken Maye for that team — and now Maye is on the doorstep of his first major NFL award and leading the Patriots back to the top tier of the NFL.",

    "description": "Returning to the Colts didn't just mean another hefty paycheck for Philip Rivers. It meant access to a strong health plan for another five years.",
    "fullText": "Philip Rivers caused quite a stir when he returned to the NFL in December 2025 as a 44-year-old grandpa.\n\nThe Indianapolis Colts, plagued by injuries and with limited options, called up their former quarterback to try to salvage a season that started red-hot. Rivers spent the majority of his NFL career with the San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers, but signed with the Colts in 2020 and played one full season before retiring after a playoff loss in January 2021.\n\nAnother clock reset as soon as he was added to the Colts' active roster: Rivers extended his NFL-sponsored health insurance, which was set to expire in 2026, by another five years.\n\nThis benefit emerged from the 2006 NFL-NFLPA agreement, which stipulates that players who are on any NFL roster for three or more seasons are entitled to five years of health insurance after retirement.\n\nIt's particularly advantageous to Rivers, a father of 10. Each of his kids is under the age of 26, making them each eligible as dependents. His wife, Tiffany, is also eligible.\n\nAs for the actual medical plan, here are some highlights of his benefits, as outlined in The NFL Player Insurance Plan published in 2020.\n\nHealth insurance plans vary tremendously from company to company, and also from plan to plan within the same company. I decided to see how the NFL plan stacks up to the High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) I'm enrolled in. Compare it to yours if you're curious.\n\nAnnual deductible. This is the amount you pay each year before insurance starts covering most costs.\n\nNFL plan: $850 per person / $1,700 per family\n\nMy HDHP: $3,000 per person / $6,000 per family\n\nWhile an NFL player only has to spend $850 on covered care before insurance kicks in, I'd have to spend $3,000 out-of-pocket before coverage begins. Note that my plan literally has \"high deductible\" in its name, but the tradeoffs for high upfront costs include a lower premium and access to a tax-advantaged savings account called an HSA.\n\nOut-of-pocket maximum. This is the most you have to pay in a year for covered health care, after which the insurance plan pays 100% of covered costs for the rest of that plan year.\n\nNFL plan: $2,000 per person / $5,000 per family\n\nMy HDHP: $6,000 per person / $12,000 per family\n\nWith a cap of $2,000 per person, an NFL player's worst-case medical year is fairly limited, whereas I'd be on the hook for $6,000. Of course, I'm taking fewer hits working behind a desk rather than behind an offensive line.\n\nPremium. This is the fixed amount you pay regularly — usually every month — to keep your health insurance active.\n\nNFL plan: $0/month. According to the 2020 NFL Player Insurance Plan, \"The Clubs fund the NFL Player Trust that pays for the benefits provided and insurance premiums owed under the Plan.\"\n\nMy HDHP: I also pay $0. Again, the tradeoff is the higher deductible.\n\nFor Rivers, returning to the Colts didn't just mean another hefty paycheck; it meant access to a strong health plan with low deductibles, capped out-of-pocket costs, and broad medical coverage.\n\nThe Colts are officially out of the playoffs, and he'll be sitting out during Week 18. If he retires for good this year, he and his family don't have to worry about shopping around for insurance until 2031.",

New Orleans Saints passer Tyler Shough and Tennessee Titans first overall pick Cam Ward were featured in a Mic'd Up clip from NFL Films to give us a look at each rookie's day at the office. It's clear they both have a strong presence, but you can see why guys are rallying around Shough after the Saints had a rough start to the season.\n\n\"Do your job all day,\" Shough said in the huddle, \"Great feet, great eyes, great technique. Make a play.\"\n\nIt's also clear that Shough has developed great chemistry with his leading wide receiver Chris Olave. He approached Olave on the bench late in regulation to tell him, \"We got to throw the ball to win the game. Throw the ball to win the game so whatever it takes bro.\" After connecting with Olave on a touchdown pass, the pair celebrated all the way back to the bench.\n\n\"Oh my God. Oh my God,\" Shough gasped, leaping to chest-bump Olave. \"I told you I'm gonna get you.\"\n\nShough vs Ward Mic'd Up 🔊\n\nJust 2 rising rookies putting on a clinic@Saints | @Titans | @InsideTheNFL pic.twitter.com/j6bm1njj8t\n\n— NFL Films (@NFLFilms) December 31, 2025\n\nIt's a really cool look at how Shough conducts himself on game days.

    "fullText": "The marathon is over. Sunday marks the end of the NFL regular season.\n\nIn recent years, Week 18 has signaled the end for the Chicago Bears. Not so this year. For the first time since 2020, the Bears are headed to the postseason. They have bigger goals on the horizon, starting with next week’s wild-card round of the playoffs.\n\nBut first, they have a matchup with the Detroit Lions. Sunday’s game has playoff implications. The simplest result is this: Win Sunday and they lock up the No. 2 seed in the NFC and a matchup with the No. 7 Green Bay Packers. A loss complicates matters a little, but the Bears are at least guaranteed a home game as NFC North champions.\n\nBears coach Ben Johnson already has declared his team is “playing to win.” Lions coach Dan Campbell said his squad will be competing, despite the fact they have nothing left to play for.\n\nThe Bears (11-5) square off against the Lions (8-8) on Sunday at Soldier Field (3:25 p.m., Fox-32). Here are five things to watch ahead of Week 18 — plus the Tribune’s predictions for the game.\n\nThe NFL season is a brutal, physical journey from the time training camp starts in July until the playoffs in January.\n\n“This is a race,” Johnson said on the day training camp began in July. The Bears are nearly at the end of the race now, and it has been a marathon more than a sprint.\n\nJust think about where the Bears and the Lions were nearly four months ago. In Week 2, the Lions cruised to a 52-21 win over the Bears at Ford Field. The Bears fell to 0-2, while the Lions looked like the team that won 15 games a year ago.\n\n“It’s early in the season and you’re still getting to know your team a little bit,” Johnson said this week as he reflected on that game. “Being in that locker room after that game and how that felt — you don’t always remember exactly what was said or anything like that, but you always remember how you felt in those moments.”\n\nMuch has changed in the 15 weeks since then. The Bears are gearing up for a playoff run, and the Lions will be watching the postseason from home. Things change rapidly in the NFL. After that loss in Detroit, the Bears won their next four games and nine of 10.\n\nThe Lions, on the other hand, started the season 7-4 and in a favorable position before losing four of the next five. A Christmas Day loss in Minnesota eliminated the Lions from postseason contention.\n\nCampbell suggested the Lions will play their starters, but he left some gray area with regard to players battling injury, which includes top receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and tackle Penei Sewell.\n\n“I think if it’s — we’re sitting there borderline, and the player, it could be hard (to play) or we think they’re setting themselves up for a long-term risk, then no, it’s not worth it,” Campbell told members of the Detroit media.\n\nWilliams needs 109 passing yards to break the Bears’ single-season record. Erik Kramer set the mark with 3,838 yards in 1995. Jay Cutler came close to topping it with 3,812 yards in 2014, but the record has stood for 30 years.\n\nChicago Bears QB Caleb Williams on 4,000 yards: ‘I was brought here for those types of things’\n\nWilliams has surpassed 109 passing yards in every game this season. Also in play is a 4,000-yard season, something no Bears quarterback has done. Ever. With 3,730 yards this season, Williams needs 270 to reach the milestone.\n\nThe primary goal remains to win the game. But Williams said this week that he believes he’s in Chicago to rewrite the record books at the quarterback position.\n\n“In 100 or however many years, it has never been done,” Williams said. “So it symbolizes something.”\n\nWilliams has played some of his best football over the last three games. In wins against the Cleveland Browns and Packers and a road loss to the San Francisco 49ers, he has averaged 274 passing yards with six touchdown passes and zero interceptions.\n\n“I’m playing better than I have,” Williams said. “These last three games, but even going back to some of the other games, some of the stats may not show it, but I feel that I’m playing better. I said it’s going to start showing here soon, and that’s a small sample of that. I’ve got to keep growing, keep getting better.”\n\nAbout that Week 2 beatdown in Detroit …\n\nThat’s exactly the type of game that the old Bears would’ve let bleed into the next week. A year ago, this same franchise lost on a brutal Hail Mary at Washington and went on to lose 10 consecutive games. Losing became inevitable.\n\nWhile the early-season loss in Detroit might have felt like a “here we go again” moment, Johnson has never let his team think too much about any one game.\n\n“That can kind of go one or two ways after that, right?” linebacker T.J. Edwards said. “And I think that shows where we’re at right now … having that belief in one another. It’s rare to have in a team where everyone is on the same page and everyone is understanding what we’re trying to get done. When those things are going wrong, it allows us to come together and make sure that it doesn’t stay that way.”\n\nColumn: Chicago Bears are ‘moving on to Detroit’ — but they won’t go far in playoffs if defense doesn’t improve\n\nIt’s a pertinent message this week, when the Bears are looking to brush off Sunday night’s loss in San Francisco. The Bears have built all sorts of momentum this season. They’ve been, all things considered, relatively healthy. Although the defense struggled against the 49ers, the team has played well overall during the toughest part of the schedule down the stretch.\n\n“It kind of just goes with Ben’s messaging every week,” Edwards said. “He’s been the same. He’s been consistent. So it’s easy for us to kind of follow. But it’s a week-to-week league, right? So after big wins, celebrate for a second and then you’ve got to get back to work, and after big losses it’s no different because there’s another one coming up.”\n\nThe Bears want to head into the postseason on a positive note. A win against the Lions would do that.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles and Washington Commanders will also kick off at 3:25 p.m. If the Bears lose Sunday and the Eagles win, the Eagles would jump the Bears for the No. 2 seed, dropping the Bears to No. 3.\n\nThe No. 2 seed will play the Packers, who are locked in at No. 7. The No. 3 seed will play someone from the NFC West, either the 49ers or Los Angeles Rams.\n\nThe Bears probably would rather take their chances against the Packers, a team they’ve played close twice already, winning once in dramatic fashion. The No. 2 seed also would play at home in the divisional round if it wins its first playoff game.\n\nReports out of Philadelphia have suggested the Eagles might sit their starters Sunday. That will be a situation to monitor. The Commanders, though, could start third-string quarterback Josh Johnson, so anything could happen even if the Eagles rest up for the playoffs.\n\nJohnson has said the Bears are playing to win, but might that change if the Eagles are down by two touchdowns at halftime?\n\nOdunze has missed four games with a foot injury. The Bears receiver hasn’t played since Nov. 28 in Philadelphia. Odunze has not participated in practice this week.\n\n“We’ll see how this week goes,” Johnson said when asked about Odunze.\n\nRookie receiver Luther Burden III suffered a quad injury on the last play against the 49ers but has been back on the practice field this week. That’s a good sign for the Bears.\n\nIn Detroit, a number of key starters have been on the injury report, including linebacker Alex Anzalone (concussion), defensive tackle Alim McNeill (abdomen), Sewell (ankle), St. Brown (knee/ankle) and left tackle Taylor Decker (shoulder/illness).\n\nBoth teams will release one more injury report Friday.\n\nThe Bears are looking to tighten things up defensively after a woeful showing in San Francisco and along come the Lions, who have some key injury concerns on offense involving wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and left tackle Taylor Decker, among others. Injuries also have rocked the Lions secondary, and opposing quarterbacks, with the exception of Minnesota Vikings undrafted rookie Max Brosmer last week, have lit up the Lions of late. The Bears have plenty of motivation with the No. 2 seed in the NFC there for the taking, even with reports that the Eagles, also in contention for that seed, are expected to rest key players for their finale against the Commanders.\n\nWeek 18 is weird. But I’m going to take Johnson’s word when he says the Bears are playing to win. I’m not convinced the Lions truly are, no matter what they say. They have nothing to play for. Beyond Week 18 weirdness, though, the Bears have shown in the second half of the season that they’re the better team. I think they cap off a remarkable turnaround with win No. 12.\n\nThe Lions are fizzling to a disappointing finish. The Bears have several incentives in this rematch: Secure the No. 2 seed, redeem the loss of a winnable game against the 49ers and avenge Week 2’s blowout loss in which the Lions ran up the score (don’t let anyone convince you otherwise). The Bears need to sharpen all phases heading into the playoffs, and the injury-riddled Lions look like sacrificial lambs.",

    "fullText": "Auburn football wide receiver Eric Singleton has punched his ticket to the 2026 NFL Draft. His announcement came via his social media.\n\nA massive transfer from Georgia Tech for the Tigers a year ago, Singleton played a total of three seasons in his collegiate. He spent two seasons with the Yellow Jackets recording over 700 yards in both seasons. This year with the Tigers he finished with 534 yards receiving on 57 receptions and three touchdowns. Singleton career totals were 2,002 yards receiving on 162 receptions and 12 receiving touchdowns.\n\nHugh Freeze's offense never seemed to fully unlock Singleton's potential at Auburn. The junior wide receiver had his lowest receiving and total yards at Auburn. Singleton did see a uptick after the Freeze firing and offensive coordinator Derrick Nix took over play calling. Against Vanderbilt, he hauled in 11 passes for 102 yards and a touchdown\n\nPreseason CBS Sports ranked him a top-10 receiver in the 2026 draft. Singleton's draft stock could rise in the coming months at the NFL Combine with a chance to showcase his speed and route running ability.\n\nContact/Follow us @TheAuburnWire on  X (Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Auburn news, notes, and opinions.

From 2023 t0 2025, though, that number dropped to just an average of 70, 56 fewer underclassmen per class and a 44 percent overall drop in underclassmen declaring.\n\nWith direct payments from schools to players now allowed, plus the NFL still having a rookie wage scale, you could see even more kids elect to return to college football this season.

    "fullText": "One of Missouri football’s best defensive players from the 2025 season is entering the NFL Draft process early.\n\nRedshirt sophomore Josiah Trotter, who spent one season with the Tigers and starred at the second level of Mizzou’s 2025 defense, has declared for the NFL Draft as a third-year entrant, he announced via his social media on Thursday, Jan. 1.\n\nIf he wanted them, Trotter had two years of remaining eligibility. He started his career at West Virginia and redshirted his first year in the sport. Trotter was a freshman All-American for the Mountaineers in 2024 before transferring to Mizzou.\n\nInstead, he’ll go through the draft process, and all indications suggest he will be a top-100 prospect this year.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Mizzou learned that fellow third-year and potential NFL Draft entrant Cayden Green will not declare for the draft and instead will return to Columbia in 2026.\n\nAll Glory to God pic.twitter.com/LB5N0p9DEv\n\n— Josiah Trotter (@TrotterJosiah) January 2, 2026\n\nThe Tigers are now waiting on a decision from one final third-year player: defensive end Damon Wilson II, who can stay or declare for the draft.\n\nTrotter was Mizzou’s leading tackler in his lone season in Columbia, racking up 84 total tackles, which included 13 hits behind the line of scrimmage and two sacks.\n\nPro Football Focus graded Trotter as the third-best run-stopping linebacker in the Southeastern Conference and as a top-five pass-rushing LB in the league.\n\nHe has significant professional pedigree in his family.\n\nHis father, Jeremiah Trotter Sr., was a four-time Pro Bowler and Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Famer who spent more than a decade in the league.\n\nJosiah Trotter’s older brother, Jeremiah Trotter Jr., was on the Eagles roster than won the Super Bowl last season.\n\nMock Draft Database has Trotter listed at No. 107 on its consensus big board for the 2026 draft, which is a fourth-round slot. It would not be a surprise to see the 6-foot-2, 237-pound linebacker climb higher as he goes through the NFL Scouting Combine and Pro Day.\n\nIt’s a significant loss for Mizzou’s defense.\n\nThe Tigers announced earlier Thursday that standout sophomore Nicholas Rodriguez will return in 2026. But, Mizzou is also set to lose two more players from its core, four-player rotation in Khalil Jacobs and Triston Newson to eligibility.\n\nThat means Missouri likely will be active in the transfer portal looking to fill those gaps.\n\nMore: Missouri football needs a QB for 2026.

    "description": "The NFL wraps up the 2025-26 regular season this weekend with Week 18. We break down which teams have something to play for and who is resting players.",
    "fullText": "We’ve made it! Week 18 of the NFL season is here and soon the playoffs will commence. But, we do have a few loose ends to tie up before we get to all that. We have the bulk of the teams destined for the playoffs already known, but there are a few stragglers and of course the dreaded jockeying for playoffs seeding. Guessing what NFL coaches will do is not something you want to make a living off of. But, we should be able to narrow this down enough to have a good idea as to who needs to win, who wants to win, and who doesn’t care if they win.\n\nBookmark this post, as we will continue to update as news comes in.\n\nThe Falcons gave the Buccaneers some late Christmas coal in their stocking by beating the Rams in Week 17. If the Falcons win this week over the Saints, the Buccaneers are eliminated from the playoffs even if they beat the Panthers on Saturday. The good news for us playing fantasy is that the NFL made that scenario moot with the Saturday game. Both teams will play for the win. If the Panthers win, they win the division and the playoff spot. If the Bucs win, they have to wait for the winner of the Falcons-Saints to decide the NFC South champion between the Panthers and Bucs.\n\nThis game isn’t as desperate as win and in, but whoever wins will get the No. 1 seed in the NFC and whoever loses will fall to the No. 5 seed. This one is pretty cut and dry and both teams will play their starters in hopes for a win.\n\nThe Steelers blew a chance to wrap up the AFC North as they laid an egg against the Browns in Week 17. The Ravens won their game against the Packers, making this matchup for all the marbles. Whoever wins, wins the North, the No. 4 seed, and the only playoff spot left in the AFC.\n\nThe Chargers have already announced they are resting Justin Herbert. The Broncos on the other hand need a win to get the No. 1 seed, which comes with a bye and home field advantage throughout the playoffs. They can still get that No. 1 seed if they lose and the Jaguars and Patriots both lose, but they won’t leave that one up for chance. They should play their starters until the game is in hand.\n\nThe Dolphins have nothing to play for, but the Patriots could finish with the 1, 2, or 3 seed in the AFC. To get the No. 1 seed they will need to win and for the Broncos to lose to the Chargers who are resting Herbert. If the Broncos win, the Patriots just need to beat the Dolphins to get the No. 2 seed. They could also lose and as long as the Jaguars lose, they’d still get the No. 2 seed. If they lose and both the Jaguars and Broncos win, then they end up with the No. 3 seed.\n\nThe Patriots should want that No. 2 seed enough to play all out.\n\nThe Titans have been eliminated from playoff contention for a while now and a loss can only help their draft position. The Jaguars on the other hand have come on like gangbusters and even have an outside shot at the No. 1 seed with a win. Unfortunately, the Chargers going with Trey Lance over Justin Herbert and the Patriots getting a relatively easy matchup with the Dolphins likely throws a wrench in those plans, as they’d need both teams to lose to get that coveted 1 seed.\n\nThe Jaguars do have to beat the Titans if they want to secure the AFC South title over the Texans, and the No. 3 seed though. And, a win of course gives them a shot at the No. 1 and 2 seeds if the Broncos or Patriots were to falter. They theoretically could fall all the way to the No. 7 seed with a loss. So they’re playing to win.\n\nThe Colts have been eliminated and will give rookie quarterback Riley Leonard the start over Phillip Rivers. The Texans have a wide variety of seedings possible between the No. 3 seed and the No. 7 seed. A win and a Jaguars loss to the Titans would give them the AFC South title and the No. 3 seed. A win secures them the No. 5 seed if the Jaguars win, while a loss could knock them down to the No. 6 or 7 seeds. These scenarios should be enough for them to do everything they can to win this week.\n\nIf the Bears win, they get the No. 2 seed. If they lose and the Eagles win, they get the No. 3 seed. Head coach Ben Johnson appeared adamant that they would play to win after their loss to the 49ers. A win and they face the Packers in the first round of the playoffs. If they lose, they’ll get the No. 3 seed and either face the 49ers or Rams at home. I’d expect them to play to win, but if news changes, we’ll update this post.\n\nThe Eagles and Bears are tied together this week as they both hope to grab the No. 2 seed in the NFC. The Bears have the inside track, as a win gives them the No. 2 seed, while the Eagles need a win and for the Bears to lose. When asked, head coach Nick Sirianni was non-committal as to if anyone would rest. The Eagles are guaranteed the No. 3 seed if they lose and/or the Bears win, but the No. 2 seed is worth playing for if they want.\n\nThe Jets have been out of contention for a while now and need a loss to keep or better their current No. 3 pick. The Bills currently have the final playoff seed at No. 7, but could move up to No. 5 or 6 with a win. To move up to the No. 5 seed they’ll need to win and for the Texans and Chargers to lose. To get the No. 6 seed they’ll need to win and have one of the Texans or Chargers lose.\n\nAt this point we’re waiting on head coach Sean McDermott to give us more intel on if he’ll play starters, but we do know all world QB Josh Allen isn’t 100% right now and beating the Jets isn’t exactly that tough. If I were them, I’d rest Allen. And at this point I wouldn’t want to trust Bills starters in fantasy games.\n\nHead coach Sean McVay says his starters will play this week, but there isn’t a whole lot to play for. If they win and the 49ers lose, they’d get the No. 5 seed. All other scenarios end them with the No. 6 seed. I could see McVay giving his starters a half and then shutting things down. I’d rather not rely on Rams players this week if I can help it.\n\nUPDATE 1/1 — Chris Olave will not play on Sunday. Nick Underhill is reporting a blood clot was detected in his lung. He will be fine, but is not going to play the season finale.\n\nThe Saints and Falcons are both eliminated from playoff contention, but Saturday afternoon could open the door this game to mean something. If the Bucs beat the Panthers on Saturday, a Falcons win over the Saints would clinch the NFC South for the Panthers. Even if the Panthers win on Saturday and clinch the division, Saints-Falcons is one of the more entertaining rivalries from the fans’ perspective. Whether it impacts the starting options for each team is unclear.\n\nJim Harbaugh announced that Trey Lance would get the start in Week 18 against the Broncos, which likely means other starters should see rest or limited work as well. But, even if all the other starters were a go, Lance is going to have a hell of a time against the Broncos defense in Denver.\n\nUPDATE 1/1 — Jordan Love has passed concussion protocol, but with the Packers unable to move out of the No. 7 seed, Clayton Tune will get the start, per Jason B. Hirschhorn.\n\nThe Packers are locked into the No. 7 seed, so they will rest key starters.\n\nThe Raiders and Chiefs have no playoff hopes left, but the Raiders currently have the No. 1 pick in the 2026 drat and they’d like to keep it. They’ve sat their best defensive player Maxx Crosby and now they’re going to sit Geno Smith for a combination of Kenny Pickett and Aidan O’Connell, per Vinny Bonsignore.",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Times NFL writer Sam Farmer examines the matchups and makes his predictions for Week 18 of the NFL season.\n\nAll lines and over/under numbers are according to FanDuel Sportsbook.\n\nLast week, Farmer posted a 9-7 (.563) record. Through the first 17 weeks of the season, he is 164-92 (.641).\n\nUsing point spreads with the scores Farmer predicted, his record against the spread in Week 17 would have been 4-12 (.333). For the season, his record against the spread is 120-136 (.469).\n\nAll times are Pacific and TV reflects broadcasts in the Los Angeles area.\n\nSaturday, 1:30 p.m. TV: ABC, ESPN.\n\nLine: Buccaneers by 3. O/U: 44½.\n\nThis was a three-point win by the Panthers when these teams met two weeks ago and figures to be just about that close in the rematch. Hard to trust Tampa Bay, which has lost seven of its last eight games. This showdown comes down to the wire and Carolina wins with a field goal to clinch the NFC South title.\n\nPick: Panthers 24, Buccaneers 21\n\nSaturday, 5 p.m. TV: ABC, ESPN.\n\nLine: Seahawks by 1½. O/U: 49½.\n\nAs hot as Seattle is, San Francisco is surging and has the experience and home crowd at its back. It will be a really physical game and the winner claims the conference title. Seattle has lost seven of eight to the 49ers with the only win being last season and by three points.\n\nSunday, 10 a.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nThe Packers are locked in as the No. 7 seed, and the Vikings are playing for pride. Have to believe with all the injuries his team has dealt with, Green Bay coach Matt LaFleur is going to make preserving health a priority. So no matter what happens at quarterback, I like the Vikings winning at home.\n\nSunday, 10 a.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nThe Philip Rivers experiment was so much fun, but now it’s back to planning for the future with Riley Leonard. Division crown is a longshot for Texans, but they can still improve their seeding.\n\nSunday, 10 a.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nLine: Jaguars by 11½. O/U: 47½.\n\nThe Titans were on the wrong end of a laugher when these teams met at the end of last month. Now they’re playing for pride whereas the Jaguars have every incentive to keep their foot on the gas. The Jaguars have won seven in a row, averaging 30 points during that streak.\n\nSunday, 10 a.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nHere are a couple teams who are out of the playoff race but have assembled winning streaks. The Falcons handled the Saints pretty easily in New Orleans last month and should win a closer game at home.\n\nSunday, 10 a.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nIt’s a small consolation but the Cowboys are determined to finish with a .500 record, so they’re incentivized. Pride and a pass rush will keep the three-win Giants in this one. Figures to be reasonably high-scoring, although that could be tempered by a bitter-cold breeze.\n\nSunday, 10 a.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nBengals coach Zac Taylor says it’s “an absolute nightmare” for his team to face Myles Garrett, and that might be so, but Cincinnati gets the edge in this one. Joe Burrow over Shedeur Sanders. The Bengals have six wins and the Browns have four. Do you still call that state bragging rights?\n\nCertainly not a meaningless game for the Rams. They need to gather some momentum heading into the postseason, because at the moment they’re rolling backward. The Cardinals have surrendered an average of 37 points in the past four games (all losses). Rams roll, but what does it portend?\n\nLine: Broncos by 11½. O/U: 36½.\n\nThe Chargers are resting Justin Herbert and other starters, so this is about getting out of Denver without injuries. Trey Lance has accounted for himself well in those rare chances he gets, but he’ll be under heavy pressure from that Broncos pass rush. These teams keep it on the ground to make it a quick one.\n\nSunday, 1:25 p.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nThe Bears need to recapture some of their swagger after losing at San Francisco, and the Lions are leaking confidence by the week. Six turnovers? Really? The Lions are going to play hard for Dan Campbell, but disdain for a division rival will only take them so far.\n\nSunday, 1:25 p.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nThe Bills can improve their playoff seeding with a win, and the Jets have packed it in for the season. Buffalo needs to wash away the foul taste of that one-point loss to Philadelphia, plus the Bills want to turn off the lights at Highmark Stadium in style. Should be pretty lopsided.\n\nSunday, 1:25 p.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nTalk about coming full circle. This will feel like an exhibition game. Better buy a program so you can figure out who’s on the field. The Chiefs have a better roster, and they feed the ball at Travis Kelce early and often. Disappointing seasons for a pair of future Hall of Fame coaches.\n\nSunday, 1:25 p.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nLine: Patriots by 10½. O/U: 45½.\n\nThe No. 1 seed is within reach for the Patriots. The Dolphins are playing for pride and individual contract incentives. Barring a bizarre twist, this one is pretty straight-forward. Mike Vrabel has his New England players ready to enter the playoffs on a roll — and in the frosty cold.\n\nSunday, 1:25 p.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nThe Eagles and Bears kick off at the same time, so Philadelphia will have to play hard in case it can move up for that No. 2 seed. Washington put up something of a fight when these teams met two weeks ago. Philadelphia is prone to offensive lapses, though, so this might not be a blowout.\n\nSunday, 5:20 p.m. TV: NBC, Peacock.\n\nIt’s winner-take-all in the AFC North. Judging by their performances last week, the Ravens should win going away. But that’s not how this rivalry works. These games are almost always super close, and Pittsburgh rarely loses at home to Baltimore. Aaron Rodgers comes through.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Mile High Report’s Christopher Hart gives his picks for Week 18 of the 2025 NFL regular season.",
    "fullText": "Week 18 of the NFL regular season is finally here. I was 10-6 with my Week 17 picks. With just sixteen games left, I’m 170-86 on the season. That’s over 65-percent accuracy which is quite good, but far below my 70-percent average from last season. Let’s see how well I do for the final week of regular season games.\n\nSaturday Football (Afternoon Game) — Carolina Panthers at Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nWith the Atlanta Falcons upsetting the Los Angeles Rams on Monday Night Football, the Buccaneers’ path to the postseason had a wrench thrown int. They must now win and have the New Orleans Saints defeat the Atlanta Falcons to secure the NFC South and earn a playoff berth. That’s unfortunate news for them. Can they finally end their four-game win streak and do their part to get to the postseason? I think so.\n\nSaturday Football (Night Game) — Seattle Seahawks at San Francisco 49ers\n\nThis NFC West heavyweight matchup is for the division title and the number one seed in the NFC. Both of these teams have defied the odds and impressed all season. This is going to be a must-watch game for all football fans. The 49ers inched out a close victory in their first matchup in Week 1. I expect this will be another close game. I’ve got the 49ers finding a way to gut this key game out in front of a hometown crowd.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — New Orleans Saints at Atlanta Falcons\n\nBoth the Saints and Falcons have reeled off multi-game winning streaks after starting off the season horribly. As mentioned above, Tampa Bay fans are desperately hoping the Saints finish the season off on a high note and earn their fifth-straight victory. And guess what? I’m predicting that to happen. Based on my picks, the Buccaneers are in the playoffs as the NFC South champions.\n\nSunday Football (Earl Game) — Cleveland Browns at Cincinnati Bengals\n\nThe Browns were able to upset the Pittsburgh Steelers and play spoiler last weekend. I don’t expect them to have the same success against the Bengals, who have notched back-to-back wins with impressive offensive performances. I’ve got Cincinnati at home in this one.\n\n\"That was sick.\"\n\nMic'd Up | @altafiber pic.twitter.com/L23CO3bMBo\n\n— Cincinnati Bengals (@Bengals) December 31, 2025\n\nSaturday Football (Evening Game) — Green Bay Packers at Minnesota Vikings\n\nThe Packers have dropped three in a row. Luckily, they already punched their postseason ticket. Meanwhile, the Vikings are riding a four-game winning streak. I’m not sure if the Packers are expected to rest players or not. They are the seven seed in the NFC regardless of the outcome. My bet is that is the case. With that in mind, I’ll take Minnesota at home.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Dallas Cowboys at New York Giants\n\nAnother game, another division rivalry matchup. With the Giants beating the Las Vegas Raiders last week, they find themselves on the outside looking in with respect to the #1 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. The Cowboys? Out of the playoffs for the second season in a row. Even so, I’ve still got Dallas winning this one.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Tennessee Titans at Jacksonville Jaguars\n\nThere are some ways the Jaguars can still be the #1 seed in the AFC. That seems improbable. With a win against the Titans, they will be the AFC South champions and get to host a playoff game. I feel confident that scenario will happen.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Indianapolis Colts at Houston Texans\n\nAfter a rough start to the year, DeMeco Ryans and the Texans have really done well down the stretch. Their defense has been the strength of their team that has carried them all season long. I’m predicting a win at home, which will likely lock them in as the #5 seed in the AFC playoff race.\n\nSafe to say we were all feeling the same way as Coach 😅\n\n🤘 | #SonyPartner pic.twitter.com/RV3lcloW0P\n\n— Houston Texans (@HoustonTexans) December 31, 2025\n\nSunday Football (Afternoon Game) — New York Jets at Buffalo Bills\n\nA failed two-point conversion attempt at the end of last week’s game officially kicked the Bills out of contending for the AFC East title. That belongs to the New England Patriots. Regardless, I think they will find a way to beat the Jets who’ve been awful the entire season. I’m taking Buffalo at home.\n\nSunday Football (Afternoon Game) — Detroit Lions at Chicago Bears\n\nWith the Bears losing to the 49ers, they have no shot at the #1 seed in the NFC. They are assured the second or third seed no matter what happens in this game. Some thought Ben Johnson might rest his players, but he stated earlier in the week they are playing to win—indicating the starters will be a go for Sunday’s division rivalry game against the Lions. Division games are always tough, and the Lions are a gritty team, but I think the Bears find a way to end the season off with a big victory. I’m taking Chicago.\n\nSunday Football (Late Game) — Kansas City Chiefs at Las Vegas Raiders\n\nIt makes my heart smile the Chiefs and Raiders have had down seasons. I don’t really care who wins this game. I’m taking Kansas City here which will officially gift the Raiders the #1 pick next April.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Los Angeles Chargers at Denver Broncos\n\nThe Chargers and Broncos are both in the playoffs. Los Angeles will be a wild card team, but the Broncos can earn the AFC’s top seed, first-round bye and homefield advantage by taking down their rivals in front of Broncos Country on Sunday. That’s a result I’m hoping for and believe will happen. Obviously, I’m taking Denver.\n\nThrowing it 🔙 at @EmpowerField this Sunday 😤 pic.twitter.com/W6u2xonlyU\n\n— Denver Broncos (@Broncos) December 30, 2025\n\nSunday Football (Afternoon Game) — Miami Dolphins at New England Patriots\n\nIf the Patriots beat the Dolphins and the Broncos lose to the Chargers, New England will be the top seed in the AFC. With that at stake, they will certainly be playing their starters. I believe Drake Maye, who might even be the front runner for MVP honors, is going to have another huge game and deliver the Patriots their fourteen victory of the season.\n\nSunday Football (Afternoon Game) — Arizona Cardinals at Los Angeles Rams\n\nAfter their last second loss to the Falcons, the Rams are now relegated to being either the fifth or sixth seed in the NFC. Bummer for them. Whether they rest their starters or not, I think they defeat the Cardinals who have dropped eight games in a row. I’m picking Los Angeles.\n\nSunday Football (Afternoon Game) — Washington Commanders at Philadelphia Eagles\n\nThe Eagles will be the second or third seed in the NFC no matter what happens here. They still have the perks of being the NFC East division winners and get to host a playoff game. The rumor is they may rest some starters. Even so, I think they beat Washington who’ve looked terrible for the entire season.\n\nSunday Night Football — Baltimore Ravens at Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nThe Steelers had a chance to make the playoffs and secure the AFC North division title had they beat the Browns last weekend. Unfortunately, they didn’t rise to the occasion and lost to the lowly Browns. That sets up a primetime matchup in Week 18 against the Baltimore Ravens. Baltimore was able to outduel the Green Bay Packers in Week 17. The Ravens are expected to have Lamar Jackson and a few players back for this game. It’ll be a tough go of it on the road, but I think Baltimore is poised to come back and win the division. Pretty impressive given how bad they were earlier in the season.",

    "fullText": "Going into the final week of the regular season, the Denver Broncos (13-3) are tied with the best record in the NFL, and they currently hold the AFC's No. 1 playoff seed.\n\nOverall, the Broncos are a well-balanced team with the NFL's fourth-best scoring defense and the AFC's seventh-best scoring offense. If there's one area where coach Sean Payton's squad is taking, it's takeaways.\n\nDenver ranks 25th in the league with a -5 turnover differential. If the Broncos are going to make a deep run in the NFL playoffs, that number has to improve.\n\n\"The one area that has to improve is the turnover margin, and that can happen,\" Payton said. \"We did a collective of the last 25 years of Super Bowl winners. It’s something like 114 in the plus. There’s been one Super Bowl winner in the last 25 years [in the negative] -- I’m just talking about when the playoffs begin, if that makes sense. When the playoffs begin, the Rams recently were the only minus-two turnover team. The rest added up to some crazy number, and so that’s something we have to improve on.”\n\nDenver has 17 giveaways this season (11 interceptions and six lost fumbles), which ranks 13th-best. A more concerning total is just 12 takeaways (nine interceptions and three fumbles), which ranks fifth-worst in the NFL. In addition to protecting the football, the Broncos need to force more takeaways. If they don't, the odds will be against them as they seek a fourth Super Bowl title.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL: Sean Payton reveals key area Broncos must improve in playoffs",

    "fullText": "CINCINNATI (AP) — Joe Burrow is in unfamiliar territory.\n\nFor the first time in his NFL career, the Cincinnati Bengals quarterback is preparing for a Week 18 start knowing that no matter what, the season ends on Sunday.\n\nBurrow was injured in 2020 and ‘23. The Bengals made it to the Super Bowl in 2021 and the AFC championship game in ’22 along with being in contention for a playoff spot up until the last game in 2024.\n\n“Obviously, you want to win a Super Bowl, you want to win MVPs, you want to be in the playoffs every year,” Burrow said. “My goals at this point are just going out and playing as good as I can and continuing to improve, finding ways to continue to be great and continue to find self improvement.”\n\nThe Bengals (6-10) close out the season on Sunday at home against the Cleveland Browns (4-12). While the Bengals defense has struggled this season, Burrow also missed more than half of the season because of a toe injury that required surgery.\n\nDuring the offseason, as Burrow works to get stronger, the front office will also need to strengthen the roster. Burrow said that he has a great line of communication with the front office and ownership.\n\n“I think my job is to No. 1, play as well as I can. No. 2, continue to improve, and No. 3, be the conduit between coaching staff, front office and the locker room,” Burrow said. “Relay feelings that players have, relay sentiments in the locker room because coaches and front office, they aren’t down there every day and they don’t understand a lot of the things that go on in the locker room. I think (as a) quarterback, your job is to relay some of those things.”\n\nFollowing three years where the Bengals have missed the postseason, Burrow said that there will need to be some changes for the Bengals to get back to contention in the AFC.\n\nBut unlike last season, when he stumped for re-signing players such as Tee Higgins and Mike Gesicki, Burrow is speaking \n\n“We want to be competing for championships every year,” Burrow said. “We don’t want to be in the spot we are in now, so something’s got to change, whether it’s players we have continuing to improve and get better and play championship-caliber football, or bringing in guys that will or whatever it may be.”\n\nRight now, Burrow’s main focus is preparing for a vaunted Browns’ defense and preparing for one of the top pass rushers in Myles Garrett. Burrow has been sacked 11 times by Garrett in nine meetings.\n\nGarrett is one sack away from setting the single-season record for sacks. While that presents a big challenge, the Bengals also have one of their best offensive lines in years. Because of the development of right tackle Amarius Mims and left guard Dylan Fairchild, the Browns will see a much-improved Bengals’ offensive line than what they faced in Week 1.\n\n“I think they’re playing exponentially better than they were at the time,” Burrow said. “I know they’re excited about the challenge, but I know (the Browns’) front is tough to deal with, starting with (Garrett). They have a lot of other guys, too, that can be very challenging to handle up front. I know they’re excited for it.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

It's been a question at the forefront of many fans' minds, thanks to the brutal 0-4, negative 107 point differential, December, the Jets are coming out of.\n\nAccording to Albert Breer of Sports Illustrated, the Jets have a clear plan in place for Glenn beyond the 2025 season. Unfortunately for any fans hoping the Jets cut ties with Glenn, there haven't been any discussions of that nature this season.\n\n\"Here's the reality of the Jets' situation:\" Breer reports, \"There has been no discussion at the upper reaches of the organization about moving on from Aaron Glenn after one year.\"\n\nDespite a rough 2025 season and very little optimism on the roster with so many holes to fill, the Jets organization doesn't plan to cut ties with Glenn after one year.\n\nIn fact, Breer's report suggests that no such conversations have even been happening. Woody Johnson and the Jets organization aren't giving up on Glenn just yet.\n\nMore: Jets expected to make 'significant' roster moves in offseason on defense\n\nEven if the Jets turn in another rough Week 18 showing against the Buffalo Bills, the Jets aren't planning to move on from Glenn after the 2025 season.\n\nJustin Fields was a major miss, and the Jets' front office, led by Darren Mougey, traded away multiple key defenders for a huge return of draft capital.\n\nThis Jets rebuild was never going to be a one-year fix. And it might not even be fixed in 2026 either. The Jets need to be patient, and for now, that looks to be the case in giving Glenn another year at least to figure things out.\n\nBreece Hall makes history despite Jets commanding loss\n\nAaron Glenn questions Jets’ effort after Week 17 blowout to Patriots\n\nWhy Jets benefit from Patriots' Morgan Moses earning $1.5 million incentive\n\nHow Jets' Aaron Glenn can follow Kyle Shanahan, Dan Campbell coaching paths\n\nNFL history doesn't bode well for Aaron Glenn amid Jets' 3-win season",

    "title": "2026 NFL Draft: 12 prospects to watch in Miami vs. Ohio State playoff",
    "description": "Which 2026 NFL Draft prospects the Detroit Lions should be watching on New Year’s Eve.",
    "fullText": "With the Detroit Lions eliminated from the 2025-26 playoffs, many fans have turned their attention to the offseason—and for many, that means turning their attention to the NFL Draft. Whether you’re just getting into the process or have been studying this draft class all year, the College Football Playoffs are an excellent opportunity to watch several of this year’s top prospects, while also consuming some entertaining football.\n\nOne of the most intriguing games in the College Football Playoff is Miami vs. Ohio State on December 31, 2025, at 7:30 p.m. ET. This game features a plethora of players that should interest the Lions based on projected needs and schematic fits.\n\nSo, let’s take a look at a dozen players Lions’ fans should be paying attention to.\n\nDetroit will enter the offseason looking to add talent to its offensive line, and depending on a few potential retirements, the Lions may need to replace multiple starters or secure future starters, both at tackle and on the interior.\n\nTop prospect: Francis Mauigoa, RT, Miami (6-foot-6, 325)\n\nOne of the most talented and consistent offensive tackle prospects in this draft class, Mauigoa should be a plug-and-play right tackle in the NFL, though it’s also being reported that some teams like him inside at guard as well. The Lions should very much have Mauigoa on their radar in the first round, regardless of how their offensive line shakes out this offseason.\n\nAustin Siereveid, LT, Ohio State (6-foot-5, 325) is a redshirt sophomore who is expected to return to school, but could surprise. With experience at LT, LG, and RG, he’s a talent on the rise.\n\nAnez Cooper, RG, Miami (6-foot-6, 347) is a three-year starter at right guard with the size and power to fit the Lions’ scheme. Likely a Day 3 prospect who could rise with a good offseason.\n\nWhile the best edge player in this game most certainly is Arvell Reese (LB/ED, Ohio State, 6-foot-4, 240), it would be surprising if the Lions were within striking distance to get this hybrid demon. A Micah Parsons/Frankie Luvu/Kyle Van Noy-type of player, Reese would completely change the Lions’ defense if they traded up to acquire him.\n\nMore than likely, the Lions will stick with a more traditional edge player, which leads up to…\n\nTop prospect: Rueben Bain Jr., EDGE, Miami (6-foot-2, 277)\n\nBain has first-round talent, but his body type doesn’t match what NFL teams typically look for on the edge. He is shorter than most and lacks the desired length. However, for the Lions, his body type isn’t too far away from Josh Paschal’s (6-foot-2 1/2, 270) — though Bain’s arms are quite a bit shorter. In addition to his pass rush promise, Bain also has the positional range to move up and down the defensive line.\n\nAkheem Mesidor, EDGE, Miami (6-foot-2 1/2, 273) starts on the opposite edge from Bain but offers a similar skill set and maybe even more positional range. Mesidor is even closer to a Paschal-like clone and could end up making his living in the NFL as a 3-technique.\n\nKenyatta Jackson, Jr., EDGE, Ohio State (6-foot-6, 260) plays a lot of 4i in the Buckeyes’ scheme, which is easily translatable to the current Lions scheme, and why the Lions drafted Tyleik Williams out of Ohio State in the first round last year. Jackson could be an option for the Lions on Day 2.\n\nWith Alex Anzalone on an expiring contract—and coming off a recent contract dispute with the Lions—Detroit may be in the market to find a starting WILL linebacker.\n\nTop prospect: Sonny Styles, LB, Ohio State (6-foot-4, 238)\n\nA freaky athlete that would be a plug-and-play WILL linebacker, but would likely cost the Lions a first-round pick to acquire, but his upside is Jack Campbell-esque.\n\nWesley Bissainthe, LB, Miami (6-foot-2, 226) is a four-year contributor for the Hurricanes with appealing coverage traits. He’s not a complete package for most NFL teams, but there’s enough to get him drafted, and he has the skills to carve out a specialty role at the next level.\n\nThe Lions will enter the offseason with a potential starting slot/nickel role to fill (Amik Robertson is a pending free agent), as well as needing a starting-level safety (or two) to carry the load while Brian Branch and Kerby Joseph recover from injuries.\n\nThe out-of-the-box prospect: Caleb Downs (SAF, Ohio State, 6-foot-0, 205).\n\nOne of the most complete and reliable football players in this draft class, Downs can play two-deep, drop into the box as a rover, play over the slot, rarely misses tackles, and is a dynamic playmaker. There is an argument to be made that Downs is the most talented player in this draft class, but with the NFL not valuing the safety position, he could slide into the Lions’ range. For as much responsibility as the Lions put on their safeties, there’s an argument to be made that they can’t pass up a player with his talents, and when Branch and Joseph return, you live in three-safety sets.\n\nStarting NB: Keionte Scott, DB/NB, Miami (5-foot-11, 195)\n\nEvery year, I tend to fall in love with a defensive back (Devon Witherspoon in 2023, Mike Sainristil in 2024, and Malaki Starks in 2025). This year, Scott is closing in on that title. While he’ll be listed as a corner in most draft guides, I see him as a starting nickel, who is more likely to be cross-trained at safety rather than at outside corner. Aggressive, hits like a linebacker, closes with conviction, and is a more than capable blitzer, Scott is an exciting prospect to watch.\n\nWhile adding to the running back room would be a luxury, I also believe you can’t have enough talented running backs, especially with the way the new special teams rules are designed in the NFL.\n\nSleeper prospect: Mark Fletcher Jr., RB, Miami (6-foot-2, 225)\n\nA bruising downhill runner with experience in multiple blocking schemes, he’s productive both on the ground and in the passing game. If available on Day 3, he’d be a solid complement piece in the Lions running back room, would challenge Jacob Saylors for a reserve power role with the potential to be a David Montgomery replacement a few years down the road.",

    "title": "Secret Superstars 2025: Xavier Watts keeps proving the NFL wrong",
    "description": "The NFL let Notre Dame safety Xavier Watts fall to the third round of the 2025 draft. The Atlanta Falcons couldn’t be happier about that.",
    "fullText": "Throughout the 2025 NFL season, SB Nation’s Doug Farrar writes about the game’s Secret Superstars — those players whose performances might slip under the radar for whatever reasons. In this installment, we focus on Atlanta Falcons rookie safety Xavier Watts, who was ignored by the NFL until the third round of the 2025 draft. The Falcons couldn’t believe that, and now, they feel quite blessed that the rest of the league let them pick Watts off as he’s picked opponents off… especially against the Rams on Monday night.\n\nWhen you’re a draft analyst, there are times when you have absolutely no idea what the NFL is thinking. There are times when a prospect has all the tape, all the metrics, and all the potential to be a first-round talent in the pros, and for whatever reason, the pros don’t agree.\n\nThis was the case in my pre-draft analysis of Notre Dame safety Xavier Watts. The safety position in the 2025 draft was basically a three-man race to the top with Watts, Georgia’s Malaki Starks, and South Carolina’s Nick Emmanwori as the primary guys, and it just depended on which type of defender you preferred. Emmanwori went to the Seattle Seahawks with the 35th overall pick in the second round to be head coach Mike Macdonald’s new Kyle Hamilton (Macdonald had helped Hamilton become what he is as Baltimore’s defensive coordinator in 2022 and 2023), and that’s worked out pretty well so far. Starks went to the Ravens with the 27th overall pick in the first round, and he’s played well for the most part.\n\nWatts, who I believed to be the best deep-third safety in this class by a fairly wide margin — and if you don’t have a credible deep-third safety in today’s NFL, your defense is utterly hosed — somehow lasted until the 96th pick in the third round.\n\nBased on his college performance, this made less than no sense to me.\n\nMaybe the NFL saw Watts as a tweener at 5’11¾” and 204 pounds. Or perhaps his 4.58-second 40-yard dash and 1.58-second 10-yard split scared people off. But this was a guy coming off a killer season in a major program, and he was shutting down some of the NCAA’s best passing games. In 2024, Watts allowed 17 catches on 32 targets for 179 yards, 115 yards after the catch, no touchdowns, six interceptions, four pass breakups, and an opponent passer rating of 30.1. This after a 2023 season in which he allowed 19 catches on 32 targets for 198 yards, 88 yards after the catch, no touchdowns, seven interceptions, and an opponent passer rating of 37.8. And as a deep safety last season (67% of his overall snaps), Watts picked off as many passes (four) as he allowed catches.\n\nI don’t know what more the NFL needed to see, but new Falcons defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich was more than happy to profit from this major miscalculation.\n\nXavier Watts in four seasons at Notre Dame: 1 TD allowed (in 2022!), 13 interceptions, 10 pass breakups, and an opponent passer rating of 41.9. This guy will deny enemy quarterbacks from anywhere and everywhere on the field. Slot, single-high, two-deep, you name it. pic.twitter.com/KpoAQ9p0av\n\n— Doug Farrar ✍ (@NFL_DougFarrar) March 31, 2025\n\n“It’s funny, you create these clusters of players at every position and, and obviously you have needs, and best on board, and there’s a lot of things that go into this,” Ulbrich said after the Watts pick. “When I kept putting my safety cluster together, we were looking at this third to fourth round as kind of like the honey-hole for that. To tell you the truth, I didn’t even put Watts on it, because I had him as a second-round guy, and I thought he was going to be long gone. If we had had our second, he would have definitely been part of that conversation. The fact that we didn’t have that second anymore, I thought he was out of the conversation, and then he ends up being there.”\n\nWatts was just as happy to be there, as he had patterned his overall game on Jessie Bates III, who would now be a teammate and mentor.\n\n“I’m really excited to be teammates with him,” Watts said of Bates post-draft. “I just think we’re very similar. We’re similar in size. He gets the ball. He’s a playmaker. He can tackle well. So, I feel like we’re very similar in all aspects of the game of football.”\n\nAfter the Falcons’ 27-24 win over the Los Angeles Rams on Monday night, we’re guessing that everybody is even happier that Watts lasted as long as he did in the draft. In that game, Watts picked off two of Matthew Stafford’s passes, and while he did allow two big-play receptions (weirdly enough, two 27-yard catches by fellow rookie Terence Ferguson, the Rams’ outstanding tight end from Oregon), if you kill as many drives as you help sustain, anybody will take that ratio.\n\nWeirdness from Xavier Watts: The only two catches he allowed against the Rams on Monday night were two 27-yard plays to TE Terrance Ferguson. Go figure. pic.twitter.com/G98LlEdJsH\n\n— Doug Farrar ✍ (@NFL_DougFarrar) December 30, 2025\n\nWatts’ two interceptions were another matter. The first came with 1:48 left in the first half, and Watts was in the deep third, taking receiver Xavier Smith upfield in Cover-3. The Falcons did a nice job of disguising their intentions, as it looked like two-deep pre-snap, but Bates came down to rob the hook/curl area, and Watts used his open-field speed to take the ball away. This was an excellent combination of athleticism and acumen.\n\nXavier Watts' first pick against the Rams. This could be MOFC or MOFO pre-snap, but it becomes Cover-3, and Watts reads the vert to Xavier Smith all the way. A little Xavier-on-Xavier crime. LB Kaden Elliss also does a great job downfield. pic.twitter.com/qhLkMZwiTU\n\n— Doug Farrar ✍ (@NFL_DougFarrar) December 30, 2025\n\nThe second Watts pick came with 9:13 left in the game — this was fourth-and-2 from the Atlanta 27-yard line, and the Falcons up 24-17. This was also Cover-3, but Bates was the deep safety this time, while Watts was in the box, waiting to jump on Stafford’s in-cut to Ferguson. Here’s where Watts got his own back against his most formidable opponent on the night, and he nearly ran this one back. Again, the Falcons threw a wrinkle at Stafford — when cornerback Dee Alford followed Xavier Smith’s pre-snap motion, that was a man coverage tell… and then, it wasn’t. It’s possible that Stafford thought it was man coverage, and Watts might follow Smith on the vertical seam bender. As it turned out, Smith was completely uncovered upfield, but it mattered not.\n\nXavier Watts' second interception against the Rams. Falcons give a man tell with a motion follow, flip to zone, and Watts jumps the quick in to Terrance Ferguson. More advanced defensive tactics. pic.twitter.com/pnhI4h0jYC\n\n— Doug Farrar ✍ (@NFL_DougFarrar) December 30, 2025\n\nWatts was also ready with the truck stick when necessary.\n\nWatts man wow pic.twitter.com/vzKBH8YWu9\n\n— Irish Muse (@NdMuse) December 30, 2025\n\nNow, Watts has the most interceptions for a Falcons rookie since Deion Sanders’ five in 1989, and there are likely a whole lot of NFL shot-callers who are re-discussing their evaluations of Watts as the draft came around.\n\n“Yeah, that’s little bro right there,” Bates said of Watts after the Rams game. “Just to watch him come in and how urgent – he was able to pick up on things. To see it translate to the field, I knew it throughout training camp, through OTAs, the way that he could process installs and stuff like that. I’m just proud of him. I’m proud of him for sure.”\n\nHead coach Raheem Morris was twice as happy about his two safeties.\n\n“Two game ball winners today. Obviously, Jessie, he’s been that way since he’s been in the league. He touches the football, scores points, makes big-time plays. He did it today. And his young counterpart, Xavier Watts, has continued to show up throughout the course of the year and just get better and better, and play at a very high level.”\n\nThe NFL’s blunder is the Falcons’ gain, and that should continue to play itself out as Xavier Watts continues to grow and develop into the true defensive force he already was.",

    "description": "Discussing head coaching candidates, one NFL insider seems to think Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski may be a target elsewhere if fired.",
    "fullText": "The Cleveland Browns are less than one week away from deciding on the future of head coach Kevin Stefanski.\n\nAfter six seasons as the head coach in Cleveland, many have thoughts on his status with the franchise. With just seven wins in two seasons as well, there is reason to believe his time in Northeast Ohio might be coming to an end.\n\nSo what is next for Stefanski? ESPN's Jeremy Fowler has a few ideas. Speaking about the future of the current Cleveland head coach, the NFL insider has stated that he expects Stefanski to be considered for other vacant head coaching jobs around the league.\n\nSpecifically, Fowler names the New York Giants as a team that may strongly inquire about Stefanski's services if he finds himself as a free agent after the 2025 season concludes. Here is what Fowler had to say on the Browns' current head coach:\n\n\"Cleveland is a spot people are keeping an eye on, with the idea that Kevin Stefanski could be a head coach candidate elsewhere if the Browns do move on... Stefanski might be the strongest retread candidate in the eyes of many. The Giants would be an ideal fit.\"\n\nStefanski does have two NFL Coach of the Year awards under his belt, and that is sure to count for something.\n\nOne interesting aspect to keep an eye on, however, is that Stefanski would be due a buyout from the Browns if he were fired. Coaches have to surrender that buyout, however, if they take a coordinator position or another head coaching job the following season. This is why Mike Vrabel, fresh off his firing from the Tennessee Titans, took a role as a consultant with the Browns. He still got his hands dirty, and he still maintained the contractual obligations of his buyout.\n\nIf Stefanski is fired, would Vrabel perhaps return the favor before the two-time NFL Coach of the Year looks for another job in 2027?\n\nThis article originally appeared on Browns Wire: Browns HC Kevin Stefanski might not be free agent for long if fired",

    "description": "The New York Giants are looking ahead to the 2026 NFL draft and here are some prospects they should scout during the New Year's Eve bowl games.",
    "fullText": "On New Year's Eve -- Wednesday -- bowl season kicks into high gear with five games, including the Cotton Bowl Classic, a College Football Playoff matchup. All 32 teams will have eyes on these games, including the New York Giants, who will have a top-7 pick in the 2026 NFL draft.\n\nThe Giants could still climb up to No. 1 overall and are likely to trade down for additional draft assets should they pick somewhere in the top-3. Despite rumors and speculation, it's doubtful they target a quarterback with Jaxson Dart, a 2025 first-round pick, under center.\n\nWith limited games remaining, Giants scouts have one final major opportunity to evaluate top prospects in live game settings.\n\nHere is a quick breakdown of the players the Giants should key in on today.\n\nPlayer spotlight: Iowa offensive lineman Gennings Dunker\n\nAlthough the Giants' offensive line improved in 2025, they still have some issues along the interior. Greg Van Roten is an impending free agent, and the team has an out in Jon Runyan Jr.'s contract should they decide to move on.\n\nWith that in mind, Gennings Dunker could intrigue them as a potential late-second-round pick.\n\nHere's what Bleacher Report had to say about Dunker:\n\nGennings Dunker is a rugged, powerful in-line blocker built with the right stuff, but will need to kick inside to guard to mitigate his middling movement skills. He has the traits to carve out a role and crack a lineup on his rookie deal in a run-first, play-action-heavy offense.\n\nDunker is a 6'5\", 315-pound offensive line prospect, who entered the Iowa program as a 3-star recruit in the 2021 class.\n\nDunker started 11 games in 2024 at right tackle, earning second-team All-Big Ten honors. He started 11 games at RT during the '23 season and one in '22 at right guard.\n\nPlayer spotlight: Texas tight end Jack Endries\n\nMichigan is a mess right now due to various off-field reasons, but that doesn't mean it will be devoid of prospect talent on Wednesday. The opt-outs on both sides will hurt, but there's still something to watch for.\n\nWhile the Giants don't necessarily need a tight end, they could look for some depth in the mid-rounds, and Jack Endries is an intriguing option.\n\nHere's what NFL Draft Buzz had to say about Endries:\n\nWhat separates Endries from typical move tight ends is his football instincts and technical refinement rather than raw athleticism. He finds soft spots in coverage with veteran-like instincts and has eliminated the concentration drops that plagued his freshman season, but his modest frame and average speed ceiling prevent him from becoming a true mismatch weapon against NFL athletes.\n\nEndries represents the modern evolution of the position where receiving ability often outweighs traditional tight end responsibilities, but his blocking limitations create roster construction challenges that could affect his draft stock. His consistent production and technical soundness suggest he'll find a role somewhere in the middle rounds, yet the inability to contribute meaningfully in run support may cap his upside as anything more than a situational contributor.\n\nMichigan RB Justice Haynes (may not play)\n\nGame notes: Michigan linebackers Derrick Moore and Jaishawn Barham, offensive lineman Gio El-Hadi, have opted out of this game. Meanwhile, Texas had 12 players enter the transfer portal, and several more opted out of this game. There are too many to list, so keep track here.\n\nPlayer spotlight: Ohio State linebacker Arvell Reese\n\nThis is the big game of the day and one that will be heavily attended by NFL scouts. What makes it more notable for the Giants is that several top-end talents will fall right into their range (from No. 1 to No. 7) -- most of whom play positions of need. Moreover, several have already been mocked to the Giants.\n\nGiants Wire has covered safety Caleb Downs quite a bit, so we went with linebacker Arvell Reese in the player spotlight instead.\n\nHere's what Mel Kiper Jr. had to say about Reese:\n\nThis is a complete football player. Reese jumps off the Ohio State tape, playing the game like a veteran. I see natural instincts at the linebacker position that allow him to make plays most guys just can't make, and he has the burst to get home when turned loose as a pass rusher. Reese has been a big riser in this class.\n\nArizona State TE Chamon Metayer\n\nGame notes: Arizona State wide receiver Jordyn Tyson, cornerback Keith Abne, offensive lineman Max Iheanachor, and running back Raleek Brown won't play. Duke corner back Chandler Rivers, offensive lineman Brian Parker, and edge rusher Vincent Anthony will also sit out.\n\nGame notes: Utah offensive linemen Spencer Fano and Caleb Lomu, and edge rushers John Henry Daley and Logan Fano will not play in this game. Nebraska running back Emmett Johnson Jr. will also sit this one out.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: 2026 NFL draft: Prospects Giants should watch during New Year's Eve bowl games",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer Saints quarterback Drew Brees is on a fast track to the Pro Football Hall of Fame — and few would argue otherwise.\n\nThe Super Bowl XLIV champion was named one of the 15 finalists for the Class of 2026, placing him one step away from enshrinement in Canton.\n\nThe Hall’s 50-member selection committee will vote on the finalists next month, with the results announced Feb. 5 during “NFL Honors.” Under the current format, between three and five modern-era finalists will be inducted, marking the second year of the revised process.\n\nBrees’ résumé is among the strongest in NFL history. He ranks second all-time to Tom Brady with 80,358 passing yards and 571 touchdown passes. After spending the first five seasons of his career with the San Diego Chargers, Brees signed with New Orleans in 2006 — a move that changed both his career and the franchise’s trajectory.\n\nHe became the face of a city rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina and ultimately led the Saints to their first Super Bowl title following the 2009 season, earning Super Bowl MVP honors in a win over Peyton Manning and the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nOver his career, Brees was selected to 13 Pro Bowls, won AP Offensive Player of the Year twice (2008, 2011), earned first-team All-Pro honors in 2006 and was named second-team All-Pro four times.\n\nJoining Brees as finalists are first-year eligibles Larry Fitzgerald, Jason Witten and Frank Gore. Willie Anderson, Torry Holt, Luke Kuechly and Adam Vinatieri earned automatic finalist status after advancing to the final seven for the Class of 2025.\n\nReturning finalists include Eli Manning, Reggie Wayne, Jahri Evans, Marshal Yanda, Terrell Suggs and Darren Woodson, while defensive tackle Kevin Williams reached the finalist stage for the first time in his sixth year of eligibility.\n\nThe committee will also consider senior candidates Ken Anderson, Roger Craig and L.C. Greenwood, along with coach Bill Belichick and contributor Robert Kraft. Between one and three of those candidates will be inducted.\n\nOnly four people were inducted last year, making it the smallest Hall of Fame class in the past 20 years.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIndiana Hoosiers quarterback Fernando Mendoza's primary focus is beating the Alabama Crimson Tidein the Rose Bowl.\n\nBut some analysts are already looking ahead, including ESPN's Greg McElroy, who wants to see a struggling NFL franchise take a shot by drafting the Heisman Trophy winner.\n\nEnter the possibility of Mendoza heading to New Jersey, McElroy said Tuesday.\n\n“Right now, I would go with the upside that you get with Dante Moore and Fernando Mendoza,” McElroy said. “I think Jaxson Dart, at this point, is a really high-floor prospect.

He was one of the top guys. ... Not only was he a great quarterback, he seemed like he was a great guy.

But he has a history of overseeing explosive offenses, particularly at the college level.\n\nKelly led Oregon to a 46-7 record and a national championship game appearance from 2009 to 2012 before spending four years as an NFL head coach — three with Philadelphia and one with San Francisco. He returned to the college ranks as UCLA’s coach from 2018-23, leading the Bruins to a 35–34 record. He was offensive coordinator at Ohio State under Ryan Day last year, helping the Buckeyes win the national championship.\n\n“This program and university are clearly on the rise, and the values of the people and this place align with my own,” he said in a statement. “I am grateful for the opportunity. There is tremendous potential under Coach Braun’s leadership, and I’m ready to contribute to this team.”\n\nKelly was the most prominent assistant hired by Pete Carroll in his first season as Las Vegas' coach after leading the Seattle Seahawks for 14 years. He reportedly received a $6 million contract, the highest for an NFL offensive coordinator. But he never lived up to the deal. Las Vegas' offense ranked among the NFL's worst when he was fired.\n\nEven so, Northwestern coach David Braun called hiring Kelly “a program-defining change” that “is reflective of our long-term commitment to the pursuit of championships\" in a statement.\n\nThe Wildcats are 19-19 in three seasons under Braun. They went 7-6 this year and beat Central Michigan in the GameAbove Sports Bowl.\n\nNorthwestern is set to move into a new stadium next season after playing home games the past two years at a temporary lakefront facility and at Wrigley Field.\n\n\"This is a seminal moment for our program under David Braun’s direction and another indication that we are prepared to pursue the highest standard of excellence in all that we do,” athletic director Mark Jackson said in a statement.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New England Patriots have enjoyed a dream season, with Drake Maye emerging as a potential NFL MVP, and the addition of veteran WR Stefon Diggs has been as significant a factor as any.\n\nThe Patriots took a gamble by signing Diggs to a multi-year deal fresh off an ACL tear in Houston, but the 32-year-old has rewarded New England by starting every game and serving as a steady hand in Maye's receiving corps.\n\nAs the Patriots prepare for the playoffs, criminal charges against Diggs threaten to hang over the team.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the charges Diggs is facing.\n\nNFL Week 18 picks against the spread\n\nDiggs was charged with felony strangulation or suffocation and misdemeanor assault and battery as a result of an incident that allegedly took place on Dec. 2, Boston 25 News reported.\n\nDiggs' arraignment is scheduled for Jan. 23, though his lawyers were in court for a hearing Tuesday to try to delay the court date until March. Diggs' lawyers also asked a judge to keep the police record on the case sealed, Boston 25 News said.\n\nThe Patriots released a statement Tuesday explaining Diggs \"categorically denies the allegations\" and pledging to cooperate with authorities and the NFL:\n\n\"The New England Patriots are aware of the accusations that have been made regarding Stefon Diggs. Stefon has informed the organization that he categorically denies the allegations. We support Stefon.

We have no further comment at this time.\"\n\nDiggs has 970 yards and four touchdowns through 16 games this season, hauling in 82 of his 99 targets. He leads the NFL in targets, receptions and receiving yards, and he is coming off back-to-back 100-yard games.\n\nMoney is on the line for Diggs in Week 18, assuming he plays, as he is 30 yards away from a $500,000 bonus and eight catches away from another $500,000.\n\nMORE:Updated playoff picture ahead of Week 18\n\nThe details of the case, including where it allegedly took place and who might have been involved, are not yet clear. Diggs' lawyers petitioned a judge to keep the police records sealed. The judge is considering the motion.\n\nThe alleged incident took place on Dec. 2, one day after the Patriots defeated the Giants on \"Monday Night Football.\"\n\nDiggs was formally charged in the case, though he did not appear in court Tuesday and will not be arraigned until Jan. 23. Diggs' lawyers petitioned to move the arraignment to March, though she has not yet made a ruling.\n\nMORE:Breaking down the Matthew Stafford vs. Drake Maye MVP debate\n\nThe NFL typically waits until legal cases are resolved before issuing suspensions, which is why Kansas City Chiefs WR Rashee Rice wasn't suspended until 2025 for an incident that occurred in March 2024.\n\nAs long as that precedent stands, there isn't any reason to expect Diggs to be suspended by the league at any point this season.\n\nThe only exception could be a scenario in which Diggs is placed on the Commissioner's Exempt List, which the NFL describes as \"a special player status available to clubs only in unusual circumstances.\" Use of the Commissioner's Exempt List is rare, but it can allow a player to not count against a team's 53-man roster while facing serious criminal charges.\n\nAt this time, there is no reason to believe the NFL is considering placing Diggs on the Commissioner's Exempt List, meaning he is eligible to continue playing.\n\nThe Patriots issued a statement on Tuesday addressing the charges against Diggs:\n\n\"The New England Patriots are aware of the accusations that have been made regarding Stefon Diggs.

    "description": "On an eight-game win streak, are the Texans among the top five teams in the NFL entering Saturday's afternoon bout against the Chargers?",
    "fullText": "On an eight-game win streak with victories over four potential playoff rosters, are the Houston Texans among the top three teams entering this weekend's regular-season finale?\n\nNope. Instead, it's another week of losing ground at the worst time possible.\n\nNope. Instead, Houston moves outside the top five because of a close call against a bad roster.\n\nFresh off a 20-16 win over the Los Angeles Chargers, the Texans sit at 11-5 and are officially back in the playoffs. They're still a half-game out of first place, but bolstering the league's No. 1 defense in total yards and scoring has made the case for them as perhaps the most complete roster in the AFC South.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars, who can clinch the division title on Sunday with a win over the Titans, still own the AFC South. A loss would take them out of the conversation should Houston win, but a win could clinch home-field advantage with losses by New England and Denver.\n\nAs for the Texans, even though they remain in second place for the division, they once again lost a bit of traction in Nate Davis' latest NFL power rankings for USA TODAY Sports, remaining idle at No. 7 overall.\n\n\"Now on an eight-game heater, their league-best defense − stifling, opportunistic and rude to opposing quarterbacks − should keep them in just about every game. But can an often limited offense, particularly in the run game, hold up its end of the bargain − especially if a franchise that's never reached the AFC title game winds up on the postseason road?\" Davis wrote.\n\nHouston secured an interception on Justin Herbert before halftime behind the return of Azeez Al-Shaair into the starting lineup after missing last week's game against the Las Vegas Raiders. That, along with two missed kicks from Cameron Dicker, were among the many issues that cost Los Angeles a chance as the No. 1 seed in the AFC.\n\nFor Indianapolis, its season went south after the season-ending injury to Daniel Jones. Losing six of their last seven games, the Colts were knocked out of the playoff picture following Houston's win on Saturday. They appeared at No. 21.\n\n\"Nunc Coepi, fellas … just not sure who you're beginning with next,\" Davis wrote.\n\nAcross the AFC South, the Jaguars took a step back after having a close call with the Colts. Yes, they won, but Trevor Lawrence didn't throw a touchdown pass and was limited as a runner outside of two red-zone scores.\n\n\"Why aren't they No. 1 … even though they might wind up there in the overall AFC standings? Their seven-game winning streak, most of those victories of the decisive variety, is currently second only to Houston's. The Jags are committed to the run, take the ball away and can rush the passer. But as well as QB Trevor Lawrence has played since Thanksgiving, he also remains an unproven commodity − at the professional level anyway − when it comes to January football,\" Davis wrote.\n\nAs for the Titans, they remained idle after losing late against the New Orleans Saints. For the first time this season, Cam Ward looked promising, but it was rookie Chimere Dike who earned the accolades from Davis and the Pro Bowl voters.\n\n\"Congratulations to Pro Bowl WR Chimere Dike, who's had a historic rookie season … even if he's not the rookie the Titans had hoped would have a historic season,\" Davis wrote.\n\nElsewhere around the league, the Los Angeles Rams are ranked No. 1 and the Seattle Seahawks are ranked No. 2 as the two leaders toward a Super Bowl run.

    "description": "The final week of the NFL season is here with the final play-off spots, both top seedings and four division titles to be decided, with three huge head-to-head deciders.",
    "fullText": "BBC coverage: Live text commentary of Sunday's games on the BBC Sport website and app (from 17:30 GMT). Also live radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds from 21:00 GMT.\n\nThere are just two places left to play for in the NFL play-offs heading into the final week of the season but plenty more to be decided, including both top seeds and four division titles.\n\nThe NFL schedulers have come up trumps as the two remaining play-off spots can be decided in two head-to-head matches.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens renew their fierce rivalry for the AFC North spot and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers need to beat the Carolina Panthers to have a chance of winning the NFC South.\n\nDenver, New England and Jacksonville could all end up as top seeds in the AFC, while the San Francisco 49ers host the Seattle Seahawks in a straight-up fight to claim top spot in the NFC.\n\nStar quarterbacks falter as 49ers eye home Super Bowl - best of week 17\n\n49ers win thriller after Browns upset Steelers - NFL week 17 recap\n\nPittsburgh Steelers (9-7) / Baltimore Ravens (8-8)\n\nThe winner of Pittsburgh against Baltimore will get the fourth seed, with division champions rewarded with a home game in the wildcard round regardless of their record.\n\nBuffalo and Los Angeles are locked in as wildcards while Houston need a win and Jacksonville defeat to jump from fifth to third.\n\nDenver will finish top seed with a win but if they lose then New England or even the Jaguars could pinch that coveted top spot.\n\nCarolina Panthers (8-8) / Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-9)\n\nCarolina or Tampa Bay will get the fourth seed and home tie depending on who wins the NFC South, but there's an added wrinkle as the Panthers could lose and still claim the division depending on Atlanta's result.\n\nGreen Bay are locked in seventh and Los Angeles could still get fifth - which when you consider could be the difference between a trip to the Eagles or Panthers/Buccaneers is well worth fighting for.\n\nThat top spot match-up between Seattle and San Francisco is the highlight though, with the difference being a first-round bye and considerable home advantage or having to go on the road being huge in the play-offs.\n\nThe top seed in the NFC and AFC both get a first-round bye and home advantage throughout the play-offs.\n\nThe remaining six teams take part in Wildcard Weekend, with three division winners playing at home against three wildcard teams - the second seed playing seventh, third hosting sixth and fourth facing fifth.\n\nFrom there, the top seeds enter the fray by hosting the lowest remaining seed left, with the next highest seed at home against the next lowest seed in the Divisional Round.\n\nThe Championship games are then contested with again the highest seed remaining hosting the game - which is why finishing in top spot can be so important.\n\nBaltimore Ravens @ Pittsburgh Steelers (01:20, Monday)\n\nThese two teams really do not like each other and they have had some street fights in their time - so a bare knuckle battle for the division will be a brutal ending as the 272nd and final regular season game on the schedule.\n\nBaltimore started 1-5 and have lost three of the past five while the Steelers have been consistently inconsistent all season, yet thanks to an unusually weak division this year one side will make the post-season.\n\nAaron Rodgers almost clinched a play-off return on Sunday but the 42-year-old just couldn't find a late touchdown pass against lowly Cleveland.\n\nMissing dominant receiver DK Metcalf, suspended after an altercation with a fan, could cost Pittsburgh dear.\n\nTwo-time MVP Lamar Jackson is a doubt for Baltimore with a back injury, but running back Derrick Henry exploded for over 200 yards and four touchdowns in his last game.\n\nHenry could be the x-factor here in a straight play-in game - the winner goes to the play-offs, the loser goes home.\n\nSeattle Seahawks @ San Francisco 49ers (01:00, Sunday)\n\nThe NFC West title is up for grabs but more importantly all the trappings of the top seeding as San Francisco host Seattle at Levi's Stadium - which also hosts February's Super Bowl.\n\nIt looks like attack versus defence here with the 49ers the league's top scorers since Brock Purdy returned from injury in week 11, coming off their first back-to-back 40-point games in 30 years.\n\nAnd they need it as without star defenders Fred Warner and Nick Bosa they've also been leaking points - as witnessed during their wild shootout win over Chicago on Sunday.\n\nSeattle's defence is the second best in the NFL with just over 18 points a game allowed and the team moved to 7-1 on the road this season after smothering Carolina on Sunday - allowing Bryce Young to pass for just 54 yards.\n\nQuarterback Sam Darnold is the only man ever to have successive 13-win seasons with two different teams, but he leads the league with 20 turnovers after an interception and fumble in Carolina.\n\nDarnold was in this position last season with Minnesota, but lost in Detroit before having a play-off nightmare against the Rams. He needs to avoid sloppy turnovers to avoid a repeat.\n\nCarolina Panthers @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers (21:30 Saturday)\n\nBaker Mayfield was in the early MVP race but the Buccaneers have fallen off a cliff since with four straight defeats making it seven losses in eight games.\n\nCarolina have also fluffed their lines though when given the chance, so one team will stumble over the line - and not much will be expected of either in the play-offs.\n\nFor the Panthers it is a win-and-in game as victory will book a play-off spot, but not for Tampa Bay as even if Carolina lose they will still take the division if Atlanta beat New Orleans.\n\nThat's because wins for the Bucs and Falcons would see all three teams finish on 8-9 - the first three-way division tie since 2011 - and Carolina hold the best record in head-to-head matches.\n\nTennessee Titans @ Jacksonville Jaguars (18:00, Sunday)\n\nMiami Dolphins @ New England Patriots (21:25, Sunday)\n\nLos Angeles Chargers @ Denver Broncos (21:25, Sunday)\n\nDenver should really get the job done here as Chargers boss Jim Harbaugh has already said he will rest quarterback Justin Herbert and any other starters that need it with a wildcard the best they can do.\n\nThe Broncos have the tiebreaker edge on the Patriots so just need to win, but should Denver stumble, New England can bag top spot with a win over Miami.\n\nJacksonville need to beat the Titans, as they should, and have the Broncos and Patriots both lose to claim an unlikely top seed.\n\nThe Jags will just have to focus on victory though, as they could suffer a big trapdoor fall if they suffer an upset defeat with Houston waiting in the wings.\n\nA Jacksonville loss and Houston victory will give the Texans the AFC South title, third seed and a home play-off tie with the Jags hitting the road as a wildcard.\n\nAll three sides are big favourites to win so things really should stay as they are, but funny things can happen in the NFL.\n\nCarolina Panthers @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers (21:30)\n\nSeattle Seahawks @ San Francisco 49ers (01:00, Sunday)\n\nNew Orleans Saints @ Atlanta Falcons (18:00)\n\nCleveland Browns @ Cincinnati Bengals (18:00)\n\nGreen Bay Packers @ Minnesota Vikings (18:00)\n\nDallas Cowboys @ New York Giants (18:00)\n\nTennessee Titans @ Jacksonville Jaguars (18:00)\n\nIndianapolis Colts @ Houston Texans (18:00)\n\nNew York Jets @ Buffalo Bills (21:25)\n\nMiami Dolphins @ New England Patriots (21:25)\n\nDetroit Lions @ Chicago Bears (21:25)\n\nLos Angeles Chargers @ Denver Broncos (21:25)\n\nKansas City Chiefs @ Las Vegas Raiders (21:25)\n\nArizona Cardinals @ Los Angeles Rams (21:25)\n\nWashington Commanders @ Philadelphia Eagles (21:25)\n\nBaltimore Ravens @ Pittsburgh Steelers (01:20, Monday)",

    "description": "Notre Dame football got great news on Monday as head coach Marcus Freeman won’t entertain NFL offers, and here are the top social media reactions.",
    "fullText": "It was a huge Monday for Notre Dame football, as head coach Marcus Freeman turned down the NFL to stay in South Bend.\n\nThere were multiple rumors about teams going after the Irish head coach, especially after the disappointing end to the year with missing the College Football Playoff. In the end, Freeman never reportedly took an interview and will continue his quest to win a championship for Notre Dame.\n\nIt can’t be understated how huge this news is, as Freeman has turned the program into what many thought he couldn’t, a perennial national championship contender. Last year was proof the Irish are close, and hopefully this season is motivation for 2026.\n\nAs social media always does, it was quick to react to the news. Here are some of the top reactions to Notre Dame retaining Marcus Freeman for at least another season.\n\nOn Monday morning, Marcus Freeman informed two NFL franchises that had been in communication with him about their jobs that he was staying at Notre Dame, sources tell Sports Illustrated pic.twitter.com/UHJV3WV7rV\n\n— Sports Illustrated (@SInow) December 29, 2025\n\nInteresting that it was multiple teams that went after Freeman, as it was only really known that the New York Giants were interested. Sports Illustrated’s Pat Forde had at least one other team who saw him as a good fit for their organization.\n\nA win for college football https://t.co/xF2VfL08AE\n\n— J.D. PicKell (@jdpickell) December 29, 2025\n\nCollege football won today, keeping one of its best away from the professional ranks. Notre Dame clearly is the biggest winner here, but this move sends waves across the top-levels of the game.\n\nMarcus Freeman off the market for NFL teams ... https://t.co/hsJrl3gWDa\n\n— Albert Breer (@AlbertBreer) December 29, 2025\n\nWas there ever really a true market for Freeman, anyone could say that they were interested. You have to wonder how he’ll react if he’s asked about this in a future press conference.\n\nSources confirm coach Marcus Freeman will be back at Notre Dame for the 2026 season and will receive an enhanced contract with the school, as athletic director Pete Bevacqua indicated earlier this month. @ByPatForde first reported.\n\n— Adam Rittenberg (@ESPNRittenberg) December 29, 2025\n\nWorth every penny. Give Freeman a blank check. Don’t let him leave South Bend.\n\nTHE GOAT IS BACK LETS RIDE COACH!!! https://t.co/J7BGjfEJZ8\n\n— ☘️ (@WeAreNDFans) December 29, 2025\n\nThis might be a bit of an overreaction, but getting Freeman back is huge for the 2026 season. He’s the driving force behind the program and will have a loaded team next fall.\n\nOn Monday morning, Marcus Freeman informed two NFL teams that had been in contact with him about their head-coaching openings that he’s staying at Notre Dame, sources told Sports Illustrated’s Pat Forde 👀 Natty incoming 2026?\n\n— Talia Baia (@talia_baia) December 29, 2025\n\nGet used to it, as long as Freeman is in South Bend, this is the new normal. Notre Dame should continue to contend for championships and should be one of the few teams that can actually win-it-all next fall.\n\nGreat move by Freeman and ND to shutdown the NFL talk so quickly.\n\nI remember the Brian Kelly to NFL talk after the national championship game run lingered for a long time (Kelly made no secret he was actively interested).\n\nIt really killed our momentum in recruiting & retention.\n\n— G'Irish Talk 🎙️ (@GIrish_Talk) December 29, 2025\n\nWith the transfer portal season coming up, having stability at the head coaching position is huge, and Notre Dame now has that. Players won’t have to worry if Freeman will leave after the window closes, as he’s already announced his return.\n\nI ask myself that every day, but I think his time at Notre Dame is not going to be much longer. Two offseasons in a row he's shown some level of interest in other jobs, mainly in the NFL. Even more so this offseason. If ND is as good as I think they will be in 2026, could be his…\n\n— Bryan Driskell (@CoachD178) December 29, 2025\n\nDriskell is one of the best on the Notre Dame beat, and hopefully his gut is wrong. You can’t deny his read on the situation, it has been back-to-back off-seasons dealing with Freeman potentially heading off to the NFL. Time will tell what ends up happening, but what we know now is that he’ll be coaching Notre Dame next fall.\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: Social media reacts to Marcus Freeman staying with Notre Dame for 2026",

    "fullText": "With the Buffalo Bills’ one-point loss on Sunday to the Philadelphia Eagles, the New England Patriots were crowned the champions of the AFC East.\n\nThis snapped a franchise record of five consecutive division championships for Buffalo.\n\nWith this streak snapped, the Bills became owners of a new NFL record.\n\nThe Bills became the first team in NFL history to win five or more consecutive division titles and not make a Super Bowl appearance during their run.\n\nThere are only five other franchises in the Super Bowl era to have ever won their division five or more years in a row.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings’ “Purple People Eaters” won the NFC Central six seasons in a row, spanning from 1973 to 1978. Like Buffalo, Minnesota has never won a Super Bowl. However, during this time, the Vikings made appearances in 1974, 1975, and 1977.\n\nThen there was the Pittsburgh Steelers’ “Steel Curtain.” This iteration of the Steelers won their division from 1974 to 1979. They appeared in and won four Super Bowls during those six years.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams held the record for most consecutive divisional titles for 30 years after winning seven in a row starting in 1973. These Rams’ seasons usually ended in a conference championship loss to one of the other teams on this list, but they did manage to make one Super Bowl in the final year of their run.\n\nMost recently, we have the Kansas City Chiefs, whose failure to win the AFC West this season ended their stab at the Patriots’ record. The Chiefs made five Super Bowls during their nine-year reign atop the division, winning three.\n\nBut none compares to New England’s NFL record 11-year division title streak starting in 2009 and ending when Buffalo claimed its first.\n\nThe Patriots appeared in eight straight AFC Conference Championship Games, made five Super Bowl appearances and lifted three Lombardi Trophies.\n\nDrake Maye Boasts ‘It’s Harder To Light Me Up Than You Think’",

    "description": "Will the ax fall on Kevin Stefanski, Mike McDaniel or Shane Steichen? We'll know the day after the 2025 NFL regular season wraps.",
    "fullText": "For 18 teams, the 2026 NFL season begins once Week 18 ends. For a select few, that means leaving losing coaches behind and starting fresh. While there are always a handful of firings across the course of the season — this year that included Tennessee Titans play-caller Brian Callahan and New York Giants former NFL coach of the year Brian Daboll — there's no worse day to be a struggling NFL coach than the day after the season is finished.\n\nBlack Monday is the scourge of underperforming playbook architects. It will claim a handful of careers to ring in the new year January 5, opening the door to coaching interviews and new hires that will energize fan bases across the world — though whether that's a good thing or bad thing will hinge heavily on the candidate. So who could be the recipient of bad headlines the first day after the 2025 NFL regular season ends?\n\nGlenn should be at the top of this list, but New York's reported insistence it will keep him suggests he's safe barring an absolute disaster in Week 18. We cannot rule this out, because absolute disaster has been a hallmark of Glenn's first season as an NFL head coach.\n\nHe started his tenure with seven straight losses. Somehow, the four-game losing streak in which he's currently mired feels worse; his Jets have been outscored by an average margin of just under 27 points per game — and that includes showdowns with sub-.500 teams like the Dolphins and New Orleans Saints. Injuries and trades have depleted both sides of the ball, but you'd be hard pressed to find anything New York does well in 2025.\n\nJustin Fields, Glenn's flier QB addition, has been either injured or terrible this fall. Garrett Wilson's injury turned the receiving corps into a host of replacement-caliber players. None of the team's three starting wideouts in Week 17 began their season on the Jets' active roster. Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams were traded in-season. Qwan'tez Stiggers, Dean Clark and Jarvis Brownlee have all made multiple starts in the secondary — a group that has yet to record an interception this fall.\n\nKeeping Glenn suggests owner Woody Johnson is chalking a brutal 2025 up to an undermanned depth chart and some bad personnel decisions. Still, it's tough to look at the Jets defense and its massive regression from Robert Saleh's peak and think Glenn has the ability to map out a cogent plan as the season wears on and the world changes around him.\n\nHe's set to get another try with multiple first round draft picks and more than $90 million in salary cap room for 2026. Failing there could set the Jets up for another generation of regret.\n\nStefanski is Cleveland's Sisyphus, only if management stepped in to give him a larger, heavier boulder after he'd cleared the halfway point of his mountain. The coach who guided Baker Mayfield to the franchise's first playoff win since 1994 and won 11 games by making Joe Flacco the NFL comeback player of the year (in just six games) has been constantly hamstrung by his franchise's inability to find a viable quarterback.\n\nCleveland traded three first round picks before handing Deshaun Watson a fully guaranteed $230 million despite more than 20 accusations of sexual misconduct and what the NFL itself described as \"predatory behavior\" dating to his time in Houston. For the privilege of blocking the team's most obvious pathways to roster improvement, Watson has played 19 games in four seasons and been the NFL's 48th-best quarterback when on the field.\n\nHis absence has cleared the way for the Browns to improve from 32nd in scoring offense last season to... 31st. The offensive line, once a strength, has devolved into one of the league's worst units. Bright spots remain thanks to Quinshon Judkins and Harold Fannin Jr., but there may not be a coach alive or dead who could coax this team to a respectable record.\n\nAfter that playoff win in his debut, Stefanski has had a losing record in four of the last five seasons. He deserves better. Cleveland firing him could clear him up to actually receive it. Expecting the Browns to do better with his replacement, however, is a tough ask.\n\nMorris got the Atlanta job over Bill Belichick. While he's been better (and less of a circus) than the nine-time Super Bowl winner has at North Carolina, he hasn't inspired confidence. Somehow, remarkably, Morris found a way to beat the Buffalo Bills but lose to the New York Jets — threading a needle that completes the world's tackiest jacket.\n\nQuarterback play has been an issue, with Michael Penix Jr.'s injury giving way to a diminished Kirk Cousins and spurts of inspiring play cropping up like islands in a sea of mediocrity. Atlanta has a galaxy of high level skill players, but thanks to injury and ineffectiveness ranks only 22nd in expected points added (EPA) per play this fall. Pouring draft capital into the pass rush has improved the defense, but that unit has gone from 20th in EPA allowed to... 19th.\n\nOutside help will be difficult to find. Releasing or trading Cousins would shave up to $35 million from the team's 2026 salary cap — useful, considering it's already over the estimated spending limit next fall — but may not be practical with Penix recovering from his third ACL tear. The team's first round pick is owed to the Los Angeles Rams as a result of the trade that made James Pearce a Falcon (he was drafted with the 26th overall selection. Atlanta's pick is shaping up to land in or around the top 10. It's not ideal!).\n\nThat could give Morris one more chance to clean up the mess he's maintained for the past two seasons. If he can fix the defense and lean on guys like Drake London and Bijan Robinson on offense, it could be enough to rise to the top of the NFC South's shallow pool. The help will have to mostly come from within the franchise. With a still-young core, the opportunity for a turnaround will persist. So far, Morris has proven incapable of seizing it.\n\nHow much of the Colts' injury-related crashout will be heaped at the feet of Steichen and general manager Chris Ballard? Indianapolis was once 7-1. Now it's at risk of finishing 2025 with a losing record.\n\nSteichen and Ballard came into the year on the hot seat, emerged as potential award winners over the first half of the season and then shrank from the spotlight as things went sour. Injuries to Daniel Jones and Anthony Richardson didn't help, but that doesn't explain a defense that ranked 10th in expected points added (EPA) per play allowed in the first half of the season slid to 23rd in the second half. Sure, a rise of three-and-outs from an offense eventually commandeered by a 44-year-old Philip Rivers didn't help. Even so, that's a dramatic backslide for a team that held three opponents to 14 points or fewer through Week 8 and has held a single opponent to fewer than 20 points in the nine weeks since.\n\nThe Colts are heading into their first full offseason without former owner Jim Irsay at the helm in four decades. Current principal owner Carlie Irsay-Gordon and her sisters have been raised in a football world and understand the big swings he took to make Indianapolis great for a long stretch (and bad-to-mediocre for a longer one). Would they opt for a clean break to start fresh this January? Or did Jones' revival and subsequent injury create enough plausible deniability to run it back next fall?\n\nInjury luck has been unkind to Gannon, certainly. But it doesn't excuse the fact he's won 30 percent of his games in Arizona over nearly three full seasons. With Kyler Murray shut down for the season (officially due to a foot injury, but unofficially because he was uninspiring and lacked the efficiency and consistency of, big sigh, Jacoby Brissett), the Cardinals have lost eight straight games. Despite a 3-13 record, they may not wind up with a top-three draft pick from it thanks to the league's hardest strength of schedule.\n\nEven without a top-two pick in a two-quarterback draft (we'll see how the spring workouts shake out for Ty Simpson et al), we may have seen the end of the Murray era in Arizona. The former first overall pick has played more than 11 games only once in his last four seasons. His 0.084 EPA per dropback ranks 23rd among 53 quarterbacks to play at least 500 snaps in that stretch, which isn't terrible but also hasn't resulted in success. The Cardinals haven't had a winning season since 2021.\n\nTrading away Murray would create more than $35 million in salary cap savings and a clean slate for a team unable to get out of its own way. Would Arizona trust a new franchise quarterback to the head coach who engineered a top-three offense in Philadelphia to get the job, then built the league's 17th-best offense in the three years that followed? While Gannon coaxed another forgettably solid year out of Brissett, his lack of wins suggests the ceiling for another veteran QB wouldn't be much higher in 2026.\n\nMcDaniel has been able to make more from less, turning around a team that looked absolutely cooked to start the season (1-6) en route to a .500-ish record. That's happened without Tyreek Hill in the lineup and followed the benching of Tua Tagovailoa. Rookie seventh round pick Quinn Ewers may not be the team's future, but McDaniel installed an offense around him that allowed him to beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 17 to further dim the Bucs' Super Bowl hopes.\n\nThat's all encouraging. It does not change the fact McDaniel failed to make Tagovailoa more than a fantasy football star, an 0-2 playoff record or a 9-14 record in December or later. The unconventional head coach has done a great job adding a slick layer of sheen atop his franchise that begins to flake apart under modest scrutiny. He's had one season with a top 20 scoring defense. He hasn't cracked the top 20 in scoring offense either of the last two years.\n\nLike Gannon above, McDaniel's franchise is on the verge of swapping out a once-touted, highly paid and since-benched quarterback in service of a fresh start. But Tagovailoa's contract, injury history and the smoldering crater his 2025 play created makes him considerably more difficult to trade and there's nearly $100 million worth of dead salary attached to the $212 million extension he signed in (deep exhale) 2024. Miami isn't bad enough to land a top prospect on an inexpensive salary in the draft. Its best option may be hoping for a Sam Darnold or Baker Mayfield-type revival from a journeyman veteran.\n\nThat could benefit McDaniel, who supercharged Tagovailoa just long enough to be an albatross around the team's neck and just won a game with a seventh round rookie behind center. McDaniel's place in Kyle Shanahan's coaching tree suggests a special appreciation for getting the most out of flawed passers. But four seasons of underwhelming returns and no playoff success to speak of may shuffle him back to the coordinator ranks for a few years instead.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: 6 NFL coaches on the hot seat for Black Monday",

    "fullText": "ATLANTA (AP) — Matthew Stafford reached a career milestone, though his three interceptions hurt the Rams' chances of winning a game and perhaps his own of winning the NFL's MVP.\n\nStafford set a career high in touchdown passes in a season with 42 when he hit Puka Nakua for an 11-yard score with 2:46 to play, but the Falcons answered with a 51-yard field goal with 21 seconds left and upset the Rams 27-24 on Monday night.\n\nStafford was 22 for 38 for 269 yards with two touchdowns and a season-high three interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown. It was the quarterback's first three-interception game since Week 1 of the 2022 season.\n\n“He’s a total stud,” Rams coach Sean McVay said. “We wouldn’t be in a lot of the great situations we’re in without him. But tonight was, it was a night that he’s capable of playing better.”\n\nStafford helped rally the Rams from a 24-3 second-half deficit to tie the score at 24 on his scoring toss to Nakua. His first touchdown was a 27-yard pass to Terrence Ferguson in the third quarter that pulled the Rams within 24-10.\n\nStafford was also sacked three times, which matched a season high, but didn't feel like the Falcons' pressure was overwhelming.\n\n“Every week is a new challenge,\" Stafford said. \"Just because you play good one week doesn’t mean you’re going to play good the next, and vice versa. So just got to go out there and continue to trust what we’ve done all year, and then we got to just show up and make the plays on game day.”\n\nStafford’s previous high for touchdowns in a season was 41, which he accomplished twice. He had 41 in 2011 with the Lions and in 2021 with the Rams.\n\nStafford was the betting favorite to win the first MVP award of his 17-year career ahead of Patriots second-year quarterback Drake Maye. On Sunday, Maye had a near-perfect afternoon against the Jets, presumably closing the gap on Stafford. Maye was 19 for 21 for 256 yards and five touchdowns in New York as the Patriots rolled to a 42-10 win. He played the first six possessions of the game and led the Patriots to six touchdowns.\n\nStafford is averaging 278 passing yards per game to Maye's 262.7, has 42 passing TDs to Maye's 30 and the quarterbacks are even with eight interceptions apiece. Maye's big day against the Jets pulled him virtually even with Stafford in passer rating prior to the Falcons game. Maye also has 409 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns while Stafford has -2 rushing yards and no rushing touchdowns on the season. Maye's completion percentage, which leads the NFL, is 71.7 to Stafford's 65.2 (18th).\n\nThe Patriots clinched the AFC East on Sunday and enter Week 18 with a 13-3 record, while Stafford's Rams are 11-5 and will enter the playoffs as a wild card. The Patriots will close the regular season at home against the Dolphins and still have a shot at the No. 1 seed in the AFC, so Maye figures to play. Los Angeles will host the Arizona Cardinals and McVay said Monday his starters will play.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "Finding the best fits for mid-round quarterbacks in the 2026 NFL Draft originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe story of the 2026 NFL Draft's quarterback class will be defined by its thinning at the top. Fernando Mendoza is the odds-on favorite to go 1.01. If he declares, Oregon's Dante Moore shouldn't last much longer. But this isn't the class the football world was sold, and teams' actions early in the offseason will reflect that.\n\nInstead, we are left with an unsteady crop of quarterbacks, many of whom decided to return to school. The seniors that aren't afforded that option are headed to the league with less hype than the summer suggested and little expectations of rookie-year playing time.\n\nIn an NFL era that has rendered the Day 2 quarterback an endangered species, several passers may fall into Day 3. While that has consequences for their rookie contracts, it could also open the door for more competitive teams offering a promising path to development.\n\nGarrett Nussmeier, LSU: Arizona Cardinals\n\nA Day 2 option that I've penciled into prior mock drafts is Nussmeier heading to the desert. It may not come as early as initially anticipated, but there's reason to believe that both parties could benefit from a fresh start.\n\nKyler Murray has proven he isn't the answer in Arizona. He may return for one last stand, but at some point, the Cardinals will need a new option under center. Unlike the out-of-structure prowess that Murray enjoys, Nussmeier projects more like a game manager. Similar to Jacoby Brissett, Nussmeier can win pre-snap and run the offense as it's intended, opening up the middle of the field and feeding receivers with more consistent targets.\n\nThe Cardinals prefer Brissett's style to Murray. Opting for Nussmeier provides a similar skill set with more credibility as a long-term option.\n\nNussmeier dealt with an injury to his midsection and wasn't quite as polished in 2025. As the floor drops on his stock, Arizona can take a shot on a new passer without wasting resources on a potential first-round prospect in 2027.\n\nJohn Mateer, Oklahoma: Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nThe Buccaneers have been beneficiaries of Baker Mayfield's career resurgence. Unfortunately for Tampa, his step back has left them closer to quarterback purgatory than they would like to admit.\n\nI'm lower than most on Mayfield, but this isn't an indictment on his status as next year's quarterback. He'll likely return and do so with the optimism of a healthier squad (and probably a new head coach). We know that this offense can work around Mayfield's measurable shortcomings, and living with his volatility has been a welcome part of the experience. Thus, a pivot to Mateer in April makes sense.\n\nMORE: Cole Payton gives Senior Bowl a small-school boost at quarterback\n\nMateer wouldn't start right away, but his similarities to Mayfield make him a viable backup in this offense and provide the Buccaneers with an off-ramp if contract talks get messy.\n\nMateer needs development before he starts on Sundays. He's more comfortable out of structure than inside it, draws pressure on himself in the pocket, and can be too reliant on his legs. Still, that mobility should amplify a below-average backfield in ways that Mayfield's scrambling has not.\n\nAt Oklahoma, Mateer's play style and moxie made him the Sooners' spiritual successor to Mayfield. He could have a similar opportunity in a perpetually-winnable NFC South.\n\nCarson Beck, Miami: Indianapolis Colts\n\nIndianapolis has created a special kind of catastrophe. Daniel Jones seems likely to return, albeit off an Achilles and not necessarily ready for Week 1. With limited mobility, he's a tough passer to trust. An orbital fracture further curtailed Anthony Richardson's development. I don't know what the Year 4 version of him looks like, and after his historically poor performances in 2024, I'm not sure I (nor Shane Steichen) want to find out.\n\nThe Colts don't have the ammo to take an early-round passer, either. This is a room that, as currently constructed, has one of the lowest floors in football.\n\nIndianapolis needs a polished passer who can keep Steichen's offense on the tracks and do enough for the ground game to churn out victories. Early on Day 3, Miami's Carson Beck might be the best bet to do so.\n\nDespite flashing early in the year (and entering the 2025 cycle as the preseason QB1), Beck profiles as a backup who has more present-day competence than long-term upside. He's played a lot of college ball against premium competition and has enough tools to trust with playing time. Throw in the allure of Steichen's wizardry and squint hard enough, and Beck is a low-risk dice roll of getting the Colts out of this mess.\n\nDrew Allar, Penn State: Detroit Lions\n\nIt was a nightmare season for everyone in Happy Valley, none more than Drew Allar.\n\nOnce a first-round hopeful, Allar began the cycle as a Day 2 option with enough upside to get Round 1 looks. He struggled in 2025, and an ankle injury ended his college career.\n\nThere is significant uncertainty in this profile. His broken ankle could dampen his athleticism, limit a skill-set that wasn't particularly twitchy, or keep him from getting crucial reps for his intangible development. He could also be fine! But no longer is Allar a polarizing passer for teams to take at a discount.\n\nAllar never proved he could cash in on his elite physical traits, even with Penn State's army of top recruits. Now, he enters the league without a real platform year and injury concerns headlining his profile.\n\nAllar needs to land on a team with a strong offensive infrastructure and no demand to play in Year 1. Few teams check those boxes like the Detroit Lions. Jared Goff isn't going anywhere anytime soon, and it doesn't make sense to move him until after the 2026 season, regardless of his performance.\n\nYet, the Lions' window is closing fast, and as Super Bowl aspirations shrink, patience for Goff will follow. There's a world in which the 2027 Lions are led by another quarterback, leaving at least one season for Allar to get healthy and develop in the incubator of Detroit's offense. Armed with an elite ground game, quality receivers, and a good young coach, Allar makes about as much sense on paper as a Day 3 project can get.\n\nCole Payton, North Dakota State: Carolina Panthers\n\nThere's a fog of war that comes with evaluating NDSU talents. The talent gap between the Bison and their competition is as fierce as any in college football, and their NFL quarterbacks have reflected that uncertainty. Carson Wentz was an MVP favorite who quickly became a castaway. Easton Stick never stuck, and Trey Lance will start in Week 18 on his third team in as many years.\n\nPayton doesn't have to follow any of those paths, but the pre-draft circuit will be crucial in selling himself to NFL evaluators.\n\nThe Panthers can't get away with drafting a quarterback in Round 1, especially if they win in Week 18 and get to host a playoff game. That doesn't change their circumstances under center, where Young has taken a bumpy road to below average.\n\nEventually, Carolina will look to move off of Young and the limitations of being the league's shortest passer. Payton offers an imposing frame as a rusher and surplus arm talent, earning him some looks as a potential starter. Sitting behind Young gives him a chance to learn under quarterback guru Dave Canales, and if he gets a chance to play, that same volatility could serve the Panthers well.\n\nIf Payton starts and plays well, Carolina can strike gold and justify moving on from Young. If the jump from NDSU to the NFL is too large for Payton to clear, he might be bad enough to get the Panthers a top pick. In either scenario, he's unlikely to set the career mark for lowest yards per completion, unlike Carolina's current quarterback.\n\nEmmett Johnson scouting report: Nebraska's back makes case for RB2\n\nTop prospects the Kansas City Chiefs can pick after Patrick Mahomes' injury\n\nArch Manning's NFL Draft decision means doubling down on Texas\n\nLaNorris Sellers' 2026 NFL Draft decision leaves more questions than answers",

    "fullText": "The Giants were able to snap their nine-game losing streak in Las Vegas on Sunday, but they still find themselves sitting at 3-13 with just one game left to play.\n\nWhile there hasn’t been much to cheer about this year for the Big Blue faithful, there are some things they can take away from the campaign with an eye towards the future.\n\nEasily the biggest is the play of rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart.\n\nDart began the season as Russell Wilson’s backup, but he quickly jumped up the depth chart as the offense struggled in the early-going, and has put forward plenty of positives.\n\nThough there have been some bumps along the way as expected with a young QB, the Ole Miss product has shown that he has what it takes to be very successful in this league.\n\nInterim head coach Mike Kafka certainly agrees, telling reporters on Monday afternoon that he has “no doubt” Dart is a legitimate NFL franchise quarterback.\n\nKafka said the 22-year-old playmaker has been a pleasure to work with throughout his rookie campaign, and he’s seen tremendous growth from him as a leader both on and off the field.\n\n“He’s learning every day, absorbing as much as he can, and putting his own fingerprint on things,” Kafka said. “That’s what’s most important is you see the growth and you see a player that’s continuing to learn from the good, the bad, and continuing to take steps forward and continuing to step up and rise to the occasion when things aren’t great.\n\n“Those are the leadership qualities you’re seeing from Jaxson, and as a player, he’s going to continue to grow and get better -- I’m proud to be working with him and happy for him, and I’m excited to continue to do that this week.”\n\nDart has accounted for 22 touchdowns (13 passing, nine rushing) while throwing just five interceptions over his first 11 starts, seven of which have been against playoff teams.\n\nHe’s completed 63.2 percent of his passes for 2,042 yards and has also rushed for 455 yards.",

    "title": "NFL coaching hot seat: Who's feeling most heat, which established guys are under pressure",
    "description": "Week 18 is upon us, which means Black Sunday and Monday are, too. Here are the names to know on the coaching hot seat as the NFL regular season draws to a close.",
    "fullText": "We’ve made it to Week 18 in the NFL season, which means we’re only days away from Black Sunday and Monday, the colloquial term for all the head coach firings that inevitably take place once the season ends.\n\nTwo head coaches, the Tennessee Titans’ Brian Callahan and the New York Giants’ Brian Daboll, have already lost their jobs. How many more will join them?\n\nWe’re taking the temperature of the coaches on or approaching the hot seat all week./\n\nRecord with team: 2-14, first season\n\nWhy he might get fired: Carroll was supposed to bring stability to the franchise, but it’s been more losing under the 74-year-old former Super Bowl winner. The Raiders haven’t won since Week 6, the offseason trade for Carroll’s preferred QB Geno Smith hasn’t yielded much, the offensive and special teams coordinators were both fired in November, and now there’s a dispute with Maxx Crosby over the star pass rusher being placed on injured reserve. None of this reflects well on Carroll, who may be in over his head trying to fix a franchise where the rot goes much deeper (and higher).\n\nWhy he might be safe: There was a reason Carroll was hired. He is almost 40 games over .500 for his NFL career, and that’s counting this season’s debacle. Also, Mark Davis has paid out a lot of money for failed coaches over the past few years and maybe he doesn’t want to shell out for Carroll too. Still, it’s hard to find a great reason to stick with Carroll, given hiss age and the Raiders’ need of an organization-wide reset.\n\nRecord with team: 45-58 (including playoffs), sixth season\n\nWhy he might get fired: The Browns are headed for a fourth losing record in six years under Stefanski, as well as a second straight year picking in the top-five of the draft. The cataclysmic Deshaun Watson trade is partly on Stefanski, who recruited him in the spring of 2022, and for all of Stefanski’s offensive acumen, none of the 13 (!) quarterbacks who’ve started under his watch has proven to be the long-term solution.\n\nWhy he might be safe: Stefanski has done quite a bit with limited talent, especially on offense, and team owner Jimmy Haslam might give him a chance to actually develop a highly drafted QB. Stefanski has also been to the playoffs twice and maintains a steady demeanor, win or lose. He has won NFL Coach of the Year twice, and it’s not like this would be an attractive opening for this cycle’s top candidates.\n\nRecord with team: 14-18, second season (this stint)\n\nWhy he might get fired: Morris hasn’t been flat-out bad, but the Falcons have regressed this season and the overall operation feels shaky under his watch. While he might end up a fall guy alongside general manager Terry Fontenot, who oversaw an all-in 2025 that included trading away the team’s first-round pick next spring, Morris also hasn’t made a strong case for himself.\n\nWhy he might be safe: As mentioned above, the Falcons’ current mess is more on Fontenot. That doesn’t mean Morris is blameless — the McVay tree magic that Atlanta doubtlessly sought by bringing him in along with offensive coordinator Zac Robinson hasn’t materialized — but it also means team owner Arthur Blank might give him another year.\n\nRecord with team: 15-35, third season\n\nWhy he might get fired: Gannon was hired in part to toughen up Arizona’s defense, and that hasn’t really happened. This year’s unit is 26th in EPA per play allowed, 27th in success rate allowed, and in general hasn’t taken a step forward despite 17 of Gannon’s 28 draft picks being on that side of the ball, including six of seven last spring. It’s hard to say the Cardinals are demonstrably better than they were when Gannon was hired.\n\nWhy he might be safe: Kyler Murray is the biggest question lingering over the franchise, and Gannon might be winning more with better QB play. Perhaps team owner Michael Bidwill gives him a chance to prove it. He did have the Cardinals on an upward trajectory through his first two seasons.\n\nRecord with team: 34-32 (including playoffs), fourth season\n\nWhy he might get fired: The story of the McDaniel era (thus far) is starting with a bang and petering out, both in the micro and macro. He made the playoffs his first two seasons (including a hallowed 70 burger against the Broncos), but lost six of the last seven in 2022 and four of his last six in 2023. Since then, his motion-heavy, speed-oriented offense has been less effective against the league as a whole, and off-field issues (including players reportedly running out defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, who won a Super Bowl with the Eagles last season) suggest McDaniel doesn’t have much command of the locker room.\n\nWhy he might be safe: Tua Tagovailoa’s limitations and concussion concerns have limited the Dolphins, and if they don’t bring him back next season, the salary cap hit would be so big that team owner Stephen Ross might decide it’s worth keeping McDaniel around one more year to get out from under it.\n\nRecord with team: 3-13, first season\n\nWhy he might get fired: The Jets have been largely non-competitive, and that’s not what anyone expected in Glenn’s first season. He earned respect as a Pro Bowl player and the Lions’ defensive coordinator the past few seasons, but the Jets’ defense has regressed, the quarterback play has been bad, and the Jets were big-time sellers at the trade deadline. Justin Fields was benched in November and defensive coordinator Steve Wilks was fired in December. There aren’t many more heads to roll here.\n\nWhy he might be safe: At the league meetings in October, team owner Woody Johnson was candid that the Jets’ problems were at QB, not with Glenn. That carries a lot of weight, and Johnson’s stance reportedly hasn’t changed. The Jets also have five first-round draft picks the next two drafts, and there’s ample opportunity for Glenn to reshape the franchise in his image.\n\nRecord with team: 193-123 (including playoffs), 18th season\n\nWhy he might get fired: The Ravens have been surprisingly mediocre this season, and it can’t all be attributed to Lamar Jackson’s injuries. Their defense has yo-yo’d between outright bad and competent, and some of Harbaugh’s in-game decisions have drawn scrutiny. Harbaugh has failed to get back to the Super Bowl with a two-time MVP quarterback in Jackson, and there’s a general sense that a breath of fresh air at head coach might be good for the Ravens.\n\nWhy he might be safe: Harbaugh has had only two losing seasons, and the stability he brings the organization is valuable. If he’s not back, it won’t be because he became a bad coach overnight.\n\nRecord with team: 200-125-2 (including playoffs), 19th season\n\nWhy he might get fired: A few weeks ago, fans were chanting “Fire Tomlin” during a blowout loss to the Bills. Then the Steelers took control over the AFC North and all was forgotten. But a loss to the 4-12 Browns, when Pittsburgh had a shot to clinch the division, forced a winner-take-all game against the Ravens in Week 18. Would a loss in that game, and no playoff berth, restart the talk about the Steelers and Tomlin both needing fresh starts?\n\nWhy he might be safe: Tomlin is a very good coach and to the chagrin of many Steelers fans, has had unending support from ownership. The Steelers value continuity, so they wouldn’t make a rash decision on Tomlin’s future. And it seems even more unlikely they’d make a move if the Steelers win the AFC North in the season finale.\n\nRecord with team: 35-35, fourth season\n\nWhy he might get fired: The Buccaneers went on a long losing streak, dropping seven of eight and losing control of a weak NFC South. The Bucs’ downturn came as they got healthier, which was confusing. There were some bad losses, and for a coach without a great career record, maybe there isn’t a reason to believe things will be decidedly better in 2026.\n\nWhy he might be safe: Bowles did lead the Buccaneers to three division titles in his first three seasons, albeit in a mediocre NFC South. And the Buccaneers are still alive to win the division this season, even though they’re 7-9. Teams usually don’t fire coaches after making the playoffs, even if it comes with a losing record.\n\nRecord with team: 57-64-1, seventh season\n\nWhy he might get fired: The Bengals have missed the playoffs three straight seasons in Joe Burrow’s prime. Some of that can be attributed to Burrow’s injuries, but the Bengals’ deficiencies in protecting Burrow have contributed to his injuries. And the team around Burrow, particularly the defense, hasn’t been very good in a few years. Burrow expressed earlier this season that he wasn’t having fun, and while he has not pinned that on Taylor, the Bengals need to figure out what changes need to be made to keep Burrow happy.\n\nWhy he might be safe: One run to the Super Bowl is doing a lot of the heavy lifting on Taylor’s résumé. That came back during the 2021 season. But that has carried the reputation of the Bengals being annual contenders in the AFC, if Burrow could just stay healthy. Also, this is the Bengals, and they’re not going to want to pay someone who isn’t coaching for them anymore.\n\nWhy he might not get the job: It’s hard to point to the Giants’ record after Kafka replaced Brian Daboll and get excited. He has fired defensive coordinator Shane Bowen and assistant defensive line coach Bryan Cox since taking over, which is the type of chaos that doesn’t look great on an interim coach either.\n\nWhy he might get the job: Kafka has been mentioned as a future head coaching candidate in previous years, for his work as an offensive coordinator. And while the team’s record hasn’t been good, there have been close losses to good teams in that stretch.\n\nWhy he might not get the job: It was a forced arrangement after the team realized Brian Callahan needed to be fired. McCoy at least had some head-coaching experience. Hiring an interim who has put together a 2-8 record wouldn’t go over well with the fanbase.\n\nWhy he might get the job: Give McCoy this much: The Titans have played better late in the season, even if it hasn’t resulted in many wins. But it would be stunning if the Titans settled on McCoy after another miserable season.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIn a significant win for Notre Dame Fighting Irish, Marcus Freeman has turned down multiple NFL head coaching opportunities to remain in South Bend.\n\nFreeman reportedly informed at least two NFL franchises Monday morning that he would stay at Notre Dame. The university later confirmed Freeman has agreed to a restructured contract. While financial terms were not disclosed, Freeman’s compensation now likely ranks in the top tier nationally. The revised agreement adds an additional year to his existing deal, extending his contract through the 2031 season.\n\nDespite strong NFL interest, including from the New York Giants, Freeman’s decision centered on alignment with Notre Dame leadership. He enjoys coaching at the college level and a belief the ND program is positioned to compete for a national championship in 2026.\n\n— Marcus Freeman (@Marcus_Freeman1) December 29, 2025\n\nNotre Dame is coming off a 10-2 season in which it missed the College Football Playoff, with both losses coming by a combined four points to playoff teams. A year earlier, the Irish went 14-2 and played in the national championship game. Freeman also collected multiple national honors in 2024, including the Paul “Bear” Bryant Award, the Dodd Trophy and the George Munger Award.\n\nThe Irish are expected to return a talented roster, highlighted by a young defense, a consensus top-five recruiting class and returning starting quarterback CJ Carr. Notre Dame will carry a 10-game winning streak into next season.\n\nFreeman, who turns 40 in January, owns a 43-12 record at Notre Dame and ranks among the most successful coaches under 40 in college football history.\n\nMichigan’s Biff Poggi warns up to 25 players may not return after Christmas break\n\nOregon's Dan Lanning rips College Football Playoff, calls for major changes\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nESPN's grade for LSU hiring Lane Kiffin will make Ole Miss fans even more mad\n\nWhy Diego Pavia attorneys are fighting the NCAA for seventh year of eligibility",

    "description": "Will the Birds play to win in the regular season finale? Here’s a potential clue.",
    "fullText": "The Philadelphia Eagles have opened as 7.5-point home favorites against the Washington Commanders in Week 18, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.\n\nWe’ve yet to learn of the Eagles’ official intentions when it comes to playing starters or not but this line seems to suggest they’re not just going to fold with the No. 2 seed potentially available to them. Or maybe it’s about the Birds’ backups being able to beat Washington anyway.\n\nElsewhere of interest to the Eagles, the Chicago Bears are just 1.5-point home favorites against the Detroit Lions in Week 18. Surprised the Bears aren’t favored by more since they have motivation to win to secure the No. 2 seed and the Lions have already been eliminated from playoff contention. Seems like the odds-makers are expecting Dan Campbell’s team to put up a fight regardless.\n\nIf you parlay the Eagles’ moneyline and the Lions’ moneyline together, the odds for that scenario are +160. It’s not likely, no, but it’s hardly far-fetched.\n\nThe thinking here is the Eagles will be playing to win in Week 18. The Commanders might not merely lay down after not liking how Philly beat them in Week 16. But their effort might not matter much with Josh Johnson potentially starting at quarterback for them.\n\nI think the Eagles win and cover, perhaps even if Tanner McKee and the backups play most of the game.

    "fullText": "The final Sunday in 2025 provided football fans with a memorable game that featured plenty of offensive firepower.\n\nWith how the Chicago Bears and San Francisco 49ers moved the ball and scored, it felt like a game that would end with whatever team had the ball last.\n\nCaleb Williams and the Bears had their shot with 2:15 left in the game, down by four points.\n\nThe Bears quarterback led his team on a 15-play drive that ended on the 49ers’ 2-yard line after Williams attempted to extend the play to find an open receiver. With the 49ers’ defense closing in, Williams threw a pass into the end zone, but it fell short.\n\nWild ending to an incredible game. pic.twitter.com/Xe6pJkBfEa\n\nThe Bears lost 42-38, which eliminates them from contention for the NFC’s No. 1 playoff seed. Still, as NFC North champions, they will host at least one playoff game at Soldier Field.\n\nHere are the five players who raised and lowered their stock in the Week 17 shootout at Levi’s Stadium.\n\nWilliams had one of his best passing performances of the season, completing 25 of 42 throws for 330 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nHis first TD pass of the day — to rookie Luther Burden III — was a perfectly thrown 35-yard strike in the first quarter.\n\nCaleb Williams drops it in a basket for the Luther Burden III touchdown\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nWilliams’ second TD pass — to Colston Loveland in the second quarter– displayed some of his elite quarterback traits. Williams drew the 49ers’ defense offside with his cadence, kept his eyes downfield after the snap, then threw a dart to his rookie tight end for a 36-yard score.\n\nCaleb Williams gets the 49ers on the hard count.\n\nTouchdown, Colston Loveland\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nWith how well the 49ers’ offense played, Williams needed to match Brock Purdy on the other side. For a majority of the game, that’s exactly what he did. However, he missed some throws.\n\nOn the final drive, Williams was heavily pressured on a first-and-10 play. He ran away from the pressure to his right but couldn’t complete a pass to wide-open Devin Duvernay on what might have been a game-winning TD.\n\nthis was 7 pic.twitter.com/WzuR5ONtEM\n\n— Warren Sharp (@SharpFootball) December 29, 2025\n\nIt only took one play for the former All-Pro cornerback to change the game.\n\nJohnson jumped Jauan Jennings’ slant route and deflected Purdy’s first pass on the first play of the game into the air. T.J. Edwards intercepted the ball and returned it 34 yards for a pick six.\n\nT.J. EDWARDS, PICK-SIX ON THE FIRST PLAY OF THE GAME\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nJohnson finished the game with zero receptions allowed on one target. He wasn’t targeted for the remainder of the game after helping cause the pick six, but he also played limited snaps in the second half.\n\nJohnson has given up just seven receptions on 12 targets for 142 yards in six games this season, and he has one interception. It shows just how important keeping Johnson healthy is to the Bears’ defense.\n\nThe Bears’ rookie wide receiver returned to action after missing last week’s win over the Green Bay Packers and quickly made an impact.\n\nEntering their third drive, the Bears had failed to record a first down. Then Williams found Burden for a 10-yard gain on second down. Three plays later, Williams connected with Burden on an explosive 35-yard TD pass, giving Chicago’s offense its first points of the game late in the first quarter.\n\nCaleb Williams drops it in a basket for the Luther Burden III touchdown\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nBurden finished as the game’s leading receiver with eight receptions on nine targets for 138 yards and the TD. He was injured on the final play of the game, and head coach Ben Johnson didn’t have an immediate update on the rookie’s condition.\n\nThe Bears’ veteran linebacker had the daunting task of trying to contain Christian McCaffrey. The entire defense, especially Edmunds, failed to keep the 49ers’ versatile playmaker in check.\n\nMcCaffrey finished the first half with 18 carries for 121 yards and one TD. He added two receptions for 20 yards as a pass catcher before halftime.\n\n: NBC\nNFL+// https://t.co/Zkva0Y3QRRpic.twitter.com/Lw0glXcnaP\n\n— San Francisco 49ers (@49ers) December 29, 2025\n\nPer Pro Football Focus, Edmunds allowed seven receptions on seven targets for 55 yards and two TDs.\n\nThe 49ers’ offense, which features plenty of motions and shifts, forced Edmunds and the rest of the Bears’ defensive front to react slowly, and San Francisco benefited throughout the game, finishing with 496 total yards (200 rushing, 296 passing).\n\nThe Bears cornerback dealt with a hamstring injury and an illness throughout the week, but he was able to start against the 49ers.\n\nHe’s had a remarkable season, but this wasn’t a good showing. Per Pro Football Focus, Wright gave up four receptions on five targets for 73 yards in just the first half.\n\nWright looked a step slow and couldn’t stay in front of opposing receivers.\n\nThe post Five Bears whose stock went up or down in NFL Week 17 loss to 49ers appeared first on Marquee Sports Network - Home of the Cubs, Bears, Red Stars and Sky.",

I see him each and every day, he works real hard. Even after practice. I feel like it just carries on throughout this whole team.”\n\nMaye had a fantastic performance in the Patriots’ 42-10 victory against the New York Jets on Sunday, throwing for 256 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nHenderson and Maye need to put together a few more standout performances in the coming weeks to help ensure the Patriots win every postseason game they play in.\n\nPatriots’ Stefon Diggs Shares Why He Loves Playing For Mike Vrabel",
