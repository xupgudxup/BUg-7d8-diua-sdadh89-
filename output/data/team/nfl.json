Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer Denver Broncos linebacker Von Miller isn’t ready to slow down. Earlier Friday, he said he wants to keep playing so he can continue climbing the NFL’s all-time sacks list.\n\nMiller was at one point widely regarded as one of the league’s premier pass rushers. This season, however, much of the attention has gone to Cleveland Browns edge rusher Myles Garrett, who set the NFL single-season sack record.\n\nMORE: Broncos predicted to cut ties with $12 million quarterback in 2026 offseason\n\nStill, one current NFL player believes others deserve credit for setting the standard before him.\n\nBroncos linebacker Nik Bonitto responded to a post on X supporting the view that Miller is better than Garrett.\n\nAt age 36, Miller tied DeMarcus Ware this season with 138.5 career sacks, ranking ninth all-time in NFL history and standing as the most by any active player. Miller recorded double-digit sacks in seven of his first eight seasons, though he hasn’t reached that mark since 2018. Over his career, he has earned three All-Pro selections and won two Super Bowl titles. He now plays for the Washington Commanders.\n\nMORE: Von Miller using former Broncos teammate as motivation to continue playing career\n\nGarrett, meanwhile, has totaled 125.5 career sacks at age 30, tying him for 20th all-time.

The Panthers are the ultimate underdog, but they already have a win over the Rams under their belt this season.\n\nAn NFC North rival renews Saturday night when the Chicago Bears host the Green Bay Packers in the first playoff game at Soldier Field since 2018.

    "fullText": "The College Football Playoff semifinal at the Peach Bowl was a clash between No. 5 Oregon and No. 1 Indiana. It was also a clash between the No. 1 and No. 2 picks of Yahoo Sports' latest NFL mock draft.\n\nIn both cases, it's pretty safe to say who came out on top.\n\nIndiana reached the national title game with a 56-22 demolishing of the Ducks, taking a four-touchdown lead into halftime and coasting from there. Hoosiers quarterback Fernando Mendoza, the favorite to be the Las Vegas Raiders' first overall pick in a few months, was 17-for-20 for 177 passing yards, 5 touchdowns and 0 interceptions.\n\nAnd Oregon quarterback Dante Moore, the projected second pick? He was 24-for-39 with 285 passing yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 backbreaking turnovers. It's safe to say the performance didn't help the redshirt sophomore's draft stock.\n\nWhen asked about his draft decision after the game, Moore said he hadn't made a decision yet.\n\n“At the end of the day, I don’t know my decision yet.”\n\nDante Moore on his future ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/W1r22EaepO\n\n— FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) January 10, 2026\n\n\"I'm going to soak this moment up and, most importantly, give my hugs and thank yous to my teammates. But at the end of the day, I don't know my decision yet. I'm going to talk to coach Lanning and talk to my family and everybody, but at the end of the day I don't want to think about that right now.\"\n\nAs of now, Moore still looms as a candidate to go second overall to the New York Jets, but his performance on Friday laid bare some concerns around his game.\n\nAfter a rough freshman year at UCLA and a redshirt year under Dillon Gabriel last season, Moore had impressed all season with his arm strength, accuracy, athleticism and command of the Oregon offense. However, he was never pressured in the pocket like he was against Indiana, and the results were ugly.\n\n— Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) January 10, 2026\n\nOregon would surely welcome Moore back for a junior season and at only 20 years old, he still has plenty of time to get to the NFL. The decision is shaping up to be one of the biggest among all underclassmen in this year's draft cycle.\n\nAs for Mendoza, you can probably guess where he's going after a dream season in which he's led Indiana to a 15-0 record while winning the Heisman Trophy.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter years of Chiefs dominance in the AFC, there’s a new heavyweight making waves.\n\nThe Broncos enjoyed a splendid 2025 campaign, besting all but three foes en route to an AFC West crown and the top seed in the AFC playoff bracket. Denver’s success largely stems from its harrowing defense, which surrendered fewer points than all but two teams. The Broncos boast a host of gifted talents across their rearguard, from reigning Defensive Player of the Year Patrick Surtain II to linebacking standouts Alex Singleton and Nik Bonitto.\n\nSean Payton’s side fancies itself a Super Bowl contender. Its record would seem to support that assessment, as the roster looks to improve on last year’s defeat in the wild-card round.\n\nWith that, here’s what you need to know about the Broncos’ playoff schedule, including who they face next in postseason play.\n\nSN's expert predictions for NFL playoffs, Super Bowl 60\n\nNFL playoff power rankings, 1-14\n\nIt's currently unclear who the Broncos will play when they begin their pilgrimage through postseason play in the divisional round. They'll be matched up against the lowest-seeded team still remaining after wild-card play. Who will that be? It's anyone's guess at the moment.\n\nAfter finishing with a 14-3 record and outgunning the Patriots via tiebreakers, Denver landed the top seed in the AFC. That gives Sean Payton's side home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, as well as a bye week during the wild-card round. While it's unknown exactly what day and time they'll play when the divisional round starts on Jan. 25, the Broncos' game will be available to watch on Fubo.\n\nFor a limited time, you can get your first month of Fubo for as low as $59.99, a $25 savings.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New Orleans Saints may have a quarterback on their hands. Rookie Tyler Shough impressed in the first nine starts of his young professional career, completing 67.6% of his passes for 2,384 yards, 10 touchdowns, and six interceptions.\n\nNew Orleans was even able to win four of their last five games under the guidance of Shough, providing optimism that he can be their quarterback of the future.\n\nIn real life, Shough had to wait to have his name called until the 40th overall pick in the second round of the 2025 NFL Draft. But almost a year removed, would he be picked any higher?\n\nIn a re-draft of the 2025 NFL Draft, Bleacher Report's Brent Sobleski projected Shough to go No. 3 overall to the New York Giants, since Jaxson Dart and Cam Ward were both off the board with the first two picks.\n\n\"Tyler Shough performed better than any rookie quarterback this past season. A person can even argue he should have been the No. 1 overall pick when compared to his classmates. He slides to No. 3 based on one factor: upside,\" wrote Sobleski.\n\n\"Aside from age, he originally fell into the second round because of an extensive injury history throughout his collegiate career. He remained healthy in 2025, but that concern hasn't disappeared.\"\n\nDespite Sobleski's concerns, it's impressive that a second-round pick improved his stock enough in nine games to be considered a top-three pick just nine months later.\n\nIt's safe to say the Saints are pleased with last year's selection.\n\nMock draft has Saints landing explosive playmaker to pair with Tyler Shough\n\nSaints HC Kellen Moore responds to concerns about QB Tyler Shough's age\n\nSaints 'expected' to play first international game in new European country for 2026\n\nSaints owner Gayle Benson provides stern update on potential sale of Saints, Pelicans\n\nGayle Benson delivers bad news for Saints fans on general manager Mickey Loomis",

    "fullText": "The playoffs have finally arrived, and we’re locked and loaded with six matchups spanning Saturday through Monday.\n\nHeadlined by the Houston Texans spoiling the party in Steeltown, here are my favorite moneyline NFL picks for every game during Wild Card Weekend.\n\nAlthough Carolina upset Los Angeles 31–28 in Week 13, an uncharacteristic game from Matthew Stafford saw the Rams’ gunslinger turn the ball over three times, including the Panthers offense going a ridiculous 3-for-3 on fourth down.\n\nThe Rams’ scoring unit remains elite across all key metrics, finishing the year first in points per game (30.5), and Sean McVay won’t allow a repeat stumble at Bank of America Stadium.\n\nRead our full Rams vs. Panthers predictions.\n\nIt’s hard to overlook Jordan Love’s playoff experience compared with Caleb Williams.\n\nIf it weren’t for Chicago’s miraculous Week 16 comeback over Green Bay, the Packers would be slight favorites — but I’ll take the Packers, who remain stronger on defense despite injuries.\n\nChicago’s stock is at an all-time high right now, making this a perfect time to push back against the public.\n\nRead our full Packers vs. Bears predictions.\n\nGet ready for a battle between the No. 1 rushing offense and the No. 1 rushing defense.\n\nWhile it’s hard to ignore Josh Allen’s mastery under center, Jacksonville has won nine of its last 10 games, and Liam Coen has Trevor Lawrence playing the best football of his career.\n\nWith Buffalo remaining banged up on D, I’ll side with the home team to open the Sunday slate.\n\nSan Francisco has been an incredible story, and Kyle Shanahan deserves a ton of credit for getting this injury-riddled roster to the postseason... but last week’s loss to Seattle hurt in more ways than one.\n\nNot only did that home loss to Seattle cost them the No. 1 seed in the NFC, but starting linebacker Dee Winters is now listed as questionable after leaving the game with an ankle injury, while Tatum Bethune is done for the rest of the season (groin).\n\nAlready without All-Pro stars Fred Warner and Nick Bosa, a fully healthy Eagles team will send the 49ers packing on Saturday.\n\nConsidering the state of the Chargers’ offensive line, this isn’t a team that can afford to play from behind in Foxborough.\n\nAs good as the Chargers’ defense has been this season, Drake Maye is going to move the ball at some point, and the Patriots faithful will be rearing to go for their first home playoff game since 2019.\n\nBank on Justin Herbert remaining winless in the postseason.\n\nWhile Houston enters the postseason on the back of nine straight wins, the Steelers have essentially backed their way into the playoffs, barely squeaking by in Week 18 following a missed field goal at the buzzer by Baltimore kicker Tyler Loop.\n\nPittsburgh’s sluggish offense remains a tough watch, and the Houston Texans’ vaunted pass rush will make life miserable for Aaron Rodgers.\n\nMike Tomlin has lost six straight playoff games dating back a decade, and another quick exit is in store on Monday.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "description": "NFL analyst Phoebe Schecter gives her predictions as this season's play-offs begin with Wildcard Weekend.",
    "fullText": "This season's NFL play-offs begin at the weekend and here BBC columnist Phoebe Schecter gives her predictions for the six games on Wildcard Weekend.\n\nAll kick-off times GMT, Conference seed in brackets\n\nLos Angeles Rams (5) @ Carolina Panthers (4) - 21:30\n\nThis is a rematch from week 13, but I don't think it's fair to look at that 31-28 win for the Panthers. They managed to stay alive in the play-off hunt but their defence has kind of been the reason they've stayed in most of their games, rather than their quarterback Bryce Young.\n\nThe Rams are one of the Super Bowl favourites and I think their defence is going to be the final nail in the coffin for Carolina.\n\nMatt Stafford is one of the leading MVP contenders and Puka Nacua leads the league for receptions. He's just so physical in taking contested catches. His one-handed catches are incredible.\n\nThe Rams have struggled in the red zone in recent weeks without Davante Adams but he's set to come back so, for me, it's a clear Rams win.\n\nGreen Bay Packers (7) @ Chicago Bears (2) - 01:00 Sun\n\nThis is going to be awesome. They're divisional rivals and it's the NFL's oldest rivalry, so there's so much familiarity. That's what makes it so exciting.\n\nThey've played each other twice in the last five weeks and they're 1-1. The Packers almost beat the Bears in week 16, and that was after Micah Parsons' injury and being without Jordan Love for most of the game (concussion).\n\nCaleb Williams is doing such a great job with his game management, his athleticism, the way the ball just jumps out of his hand, and his receivers are coming together, so I have the Bears on this one.\n\nThey have had the most fourth-quarter comebacks in a season (six) and their defence leads the league with 33 takeaways. They'll probably need to get a couple more against Jordan Love to really seal the deal.\n\nLive text commentary on all play-off games on the BBC Sport website and app, plus live radio commentary on selected games on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds. The Whole 10 Yards, BBC Sport's weekly NFL programme, will also follow the road to Super Bowl 60\n\nBuffalo Bills (6) @ Jacksonville Jaguars (3) - 18:00\n\nWith Kansas City, Cincinnati and Baltimore not in the play-offs, this is the clearest route to the Super Bowl the Bills have had, but this is a scary Jags team.\n\nThey've won their last eight, so they're the team that has momentum. They're having fun out there, and we've never seen this version of Trevor Lawrence before, the way he's finishing in the red zone. He looks so confident.\n\nThe Jags have been clicking on all three phases since their bye week. They brought in Jakobi Myers and the Bills have to stop Travis Etienne running all over them.\n\nBut I still have so much faith in Josh Allen. We've seen it so many times, where he comes to life in the fourth quarter, and it's hard to bet against him. So I'm going for my Bills, especially because I'll be working at the game – and I can't stand the thought of them losing!\n\nSan Francisco 49ers (6) @ Philadelphia Eagles (3) - 21:30\n\nGiven their injuries, coach Kyle Shanahan has been incredible to get the 49ers where they are. They have done a great job of staying afloat with their defence, but I just don't know how sustainable it is.\n\nHaving slipped from potentially the top seed to the sixth, Shanahan's been like 'we've just got to do it the hard way'. This must mean so much to them because of the 2023 NFC Championship game in Philly, when Brock Purdy got injured and Christian McCaffrey had to play quarterback.\n\nI don't think the Eagles are going to do anything fancy. They're going to run the ball, get the play-action to throw outside to their receivers and then play great defence.\n\nIt's not cute, it's not exciting, but they just know how to win. I have a lot of faith in Jalen Hurts and their defence, so I'm going Eagles.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (7) @ New England Patriots (2) - 01:00 Mon\n\nPlaying at New England is tough in the cold and I think that makes a big difference. I don't know how much further the Patriots will go, but I think they'll win this.\n\nJustin Herbert's been hit so many times. The Chargers' offensive line has just not been able to protect him. Like the Bills, their receivers haven't been able to get separation. It's like Herbert's the magic man again, whereas at least the Patriots have some receivers, and Drake Maye has been phenomenal.\n\nI think he's earned the MVP because it's a great story. He's with a franchise that's not been itself since Tom Brady left and it's unbelievable what he's done in his second year.\n\nYou can only say their schedule has been easy so many times. You still have to beat the teams in front of you, and he's been decisive, he's stepping up in the pocket and the way he throws the ball is beautiful.\n\nWhy the NFL play-offs are the 'most unusual' in years\n\nHouston Texans (5) @ Pittsburgh Steelers (4) - 01:00 Tue\n\nThe Steelers' win on Sunday was wild, but I think we have the same conversation around them every year. Mike Tomlin's done a great job, they've got a winning record again and got to the play-offs, but for so long it's not been more than that.\n\nI'm going for the Texans because of their defence, it's just ferocious. Danielle Hunter has 15 sacks, Will Anderson is second in the NFL with a career-high 85 QB pressures, and they have four players with four interceptions. That's a crazy stat - which of their defensive backs do you throw towards?\n\nAaron Rodgers is doing tons trying to get the Steelers' offence on the same page but they're still having miscues. DK Metcalf is back from suspension but I just don't see them having enough firepower to compete with this defence.\n\nIt's the main reason the Texans could make it deep into the play-offs. They can cause a lot of trouble for a lot of people.\n\nPhoebe Schecter was speaking to BBC Sport's Ben Collins.\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Weather could make it difficult for both quarterbacks, which puts an emphasis on the running game. Maye should get more help in that regard than Justin Herbert.",
    "fullText": "Welcome back to the playoffs, New England Patriots.\n\nThe last time we saw the Patriot Way grace us this deep into January, New England got drilled in Buffalo with Mac Jones leading the way at quarterback in the 2021 season. New England's last postseason home game happened to be the last time we saw Tom Brady in a Patriots uniform, suffering an upset loss to Mike Vrabel and the Tennessee Titans in the 2019 season’s playoffs.\n\nSpeaking of Vrabel, he's back, this time in familiar digs as New England's head coach. But all eyes will be mainly focused on his quarterback, Drake Maye, who is in a tight MVP race with the Los Angeles Rams' Matthew Stafford.\n\nThe Chargers and Patriots didn’t play each other this season. The two teams matched up late in 2024 with Los Angeles winning decisively in New England, 40-7. Maye passed for only 117 yards, his worst game as a full-time starter during his rookie season.\n\nOn the other side, Justin Herbert posted the kind of performance the Chargers will need from him Sunday night. He threw for 281 yards and three touchdowns, two of those scoring passes going to Ladd McConkey, who finished with 94 yards. J.K. Dobbins (now with the Broncos) rushed for 76 yards.\n\nThe Patriots have no major injuries to deal with going into Sunday. But five players missed practice this week due to illness and the team will hope more don’t come down with a bug leading up to kickoff. For the Chargers, starting running back Omarion Hampton — the team’s second-leading rusher — hasn’t practiced all week due to an ankle issue that sidelined him for eight games this season. Edge rusher Bud Dupree has also missed practice.\n\nIt’s Michigan vs. Ohio State on the opposing sidelines.\n\nVrabel is a leading candidate for Coach of the Year honors after turning New England around from a 4-13 slog in 2024 to a 13-4 resurgence this season. He has a 3-5 playoff record, which includes the Tennessee Titans’ run to the AFC championship game in the 2019 season. Harbaugh boasts a 5-4 mark, which includes three consecutive NFC championship games with the San Francisco 49ers and an appearance in Super Bowl XLVII. Yet the Chargers lost in last season’s wild-card round, 32-12, to the Houston Texans.\n\nAs Herbert goes, so do the Chargers. Last season, he threw four interceptions in Los Angeles’ playoff defeat. This season, when he didn’t play well, the Chargers typically couldn’t overcome those poor performances. (The lone exception was Week 14’s 22-19 overtime win over the Philadelphia Eagles, in which Herbert threw for only 139 yards.) However, the Patriots may provide an ideal matchup for Herbert to shine. New England allowed 4,459 passing yards this season and 8.9 yards per throw, both worst in the AFC. And only the Bengals gave up more TD passes (36) this season than the Patriots’ 31 among conference teams.\n\nMaye has been viewed as an MVP candidate throughout the season. But he’ll face the NFL’s fourth-best pass defense (3,314 yards allowed) in the Chargers. Only two other teams had more interceptions than the 19 Los Angeles grabbed this season. So the Patriots may have to run the ball to win. That could suit them well, as they compiled the third-most rushing yards in the AFC. TreVeyon Henderson led the team with 911 yards and nine TDs. He ran for a season-high 148 yards and two scores in Week 15 versus the Bills.\n\nNew England was actually better on the road (8-0) this season than at home (6-3). But temperatures in Foxborough, Massachusetts, are expected to be in the mid-30s by Sunday’s 8 p.m. ET kickoff, which isn’t ideal for a team coming from Los Angeles.\n\nThe conditions could make it difficult for both quarterbacks, which puts an emphasis on the running game. Maye should get more help in that regard than Herbert. The Patriots’ ability to control the line of scrimmage on offense with two talented running backs capable of rushing for 100 yards could be the difference.",

    "fullText": "Fernando Mendoza vs. Dante Moore: The key stats you need to know in 2026 NFL Draft debate originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFernando Mendoza and Dante Moore didn't have much of a Big Ten quarterback duel when Indiana beat Oregon in the college football regular season. But now that both QBs have led their teams to playoff semifinals, a lot more is at stake.\n\nWhen Mendoza's Hoosiers have their rematch with Moore's Ducks in Friday's Peach Bowl in Atlanta, there will be a trip to the national championship game at stake. The outcome and the related performances will also help determine which QB goes to the top of the draft class in 2026.\n\nWith the Las Vegas Raiders and New York Jets having the No. 1 and No. 2 overall picks and badly needing quarterbacks, the franchises will spend a lot of time on vetting Mendoza vs. Moore.\n\nBetween arm strength, accuracy, pocket presence and intangibles, there's a lot to like about Mendoza (6-5, 225), the Heisman Trophy winner, and Moore, a well-rounded talent. But their head-to-head stats will no doubt have some influence on who ends up coming off the board first.\n\nHere's looking at their seasons before playing again, including what happened in the previous matchup on Oct. 11:\n\nNFL MOCK DRAFT: Where Fernando Mendoza and Dante Moore land in latest projections\n\nMoore had more volume, but in terms of efficiency and every other category, Mendoza stood out as the worthy Heisman winner, with Vanderbilt's Diego Pavia and Ohio State's Julian Sayin making the cut over Moore as finalists. Neither Mendoza nor Moore would be considered dual threats with their running, but they have enough wheels to extend pass plays and rush for key yardage in big moments.\n\nHere are the numbers both QBs put when facing each other's tough defenses back on Oct. 11, played at Oregon's Autzen Stadium:\n\nThat wasn't the best showcase game for either QB, given the respective degrees of difficulty. Mendoza did outplay Moore. Expect both QBs to perform much better as more seasoned and playoff-winning passers almost three months later.\n\nMORE: Five players to watch in the Indiana vs. Oregon CPF semifinal\n\nThe Raiders already are on the clock for April 23 in Pittsburgh. Given the influence of former Big Ten passer Tom Brady as part-owner, he has a tough decision to make for the new face of the franchise. Mendoza, given his gritty profile and clutch confidence, would seem to fit better as the Raiders' savior.\n\nMoore, meanwhile, might be the right QB on whom the Jets can take a shot with his mental and physical attributes to deliver for Aaron Glenn and Tanner Engstrand, who coached Jared Goff in Detroit. Another QB such as Alabama's Ty Simpson could emerge in the conversation, but for now, Mendoza is the man.\n\nThere's a long way to go in the draft process, however, including the Combine and pro days. Mendoza vs. Moore started off mild, but it's become red-hot on the biggest stages.\n\nMORE 2026 COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF NEWS:\n\nExpert picks for Indiana vs. Oregon CFP semifinal\n\nRanking four teams remaining in College Football Playoff\n\nPredictions for Ole Miss vs. Miami CFP semifinal",

    "description": "Nearly four years after the lawsuit was first filed, a key threshold question is moving toward a final answer.",
    "fullText": "Nearly four years after the lawsuit was first filed, a key threshold question is moving toward a final answer.\n\nThe NFL has filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court as to the question of whether the civil action filed in February 2022 by former Dolphins coach (and current Vikings defensive coordinator) Brian Flores against the NFL, the Dolphins, the Giants, the Broncos, and the Texans will be resolved in court, or in arbitration.\n\nThe specific legal question presented to the Supreme Court is this: \"Whether an arbitration agreement governing disputes in a professional sports league is categorically unenforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act because it designates the league commissioner as the default arbitrator and permits the commissioner to develop arbitral procedures.\"\n\nThe NFL has wisely narrowed the question, given that the reasoning (if applied throughout corporate America) would empower other companies to attempt to rig the in-house arbitration process by putting employment disputes in the hands of the CEO. Still, the league's position is clear — it wants the Commissioner to retain power over disputes involving the NFL and the various teams that have hired and that handsomely compensate the Commissioner.\n\nThe 25-page document is the first step in an effort to persuade the Supreme Court to take up the case. Of the many petitions it receives each year, few are accepted.\n\nMore time will pass as the Supreme Court considers whether to take the case. Even more time will pass if the Supreme Court grants the petition.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit invalidated the NFL's arbitration provision, concluding that the procedure lacks independence. (And it does.) The Supreme Court, if it takes the case, will decide once and for all whether it's legitimate for the NFL (and any sports league) to put its Commissioner in charge of claims made against the NFL.\n\nIt's fundamentally unfair to delegate those powers to someone whose connection to one side of a legal fight is so obvious. Frankly, no Commissioner should want to be expected to set aside their clear self-interests in an effort to dispense justice in an objective way.\n\nBut this has been the league's practice, for years. It desperately wants to run its own business. It desperately hopes to hold the gavel when it comes to deciding whether the legal claims against it are valid.\n\nIt's a bad way to do business. It's now for the Supreme Court to decide whether it's a good way, or a bad way, to apply the laws of the United States.",

    "fullText": "The President of the United States is officially \"warning\" all 32 teams across the National Football League.\n\nPresident Trump, 79, is not happy with the Baltimore Ravens firing John Harbaugh. He's warning both the Ravens - and the rest of the league - that they will be making a big mistake if they don't hire him. President Trump is a major fan of the Super Bowl-winning head coach.\n\nWhile some have told political figures to stay out of sports, President Trump is very much making his presence felt. The President of the United States is expected to pressure NFL teams into hiring John Harbaugh. President Trump has a close relationship with many prominent NFL owners.\n\nPresident Trump issued his official \"warning\" to the 32 NFL franchises on social media this week, following Harbaugh's firing.\n\n\"HIRE JOHN HARBAUGH, FAST,\" Trump warned. \"HE AND HIS BROTHER, ARE TOTAL WINNERS!!!\"\n\nJohn Harbaugh has previously shown love for President Trump and the White House.\n\nHarbaugh, who led the Ravens to a Super Bowl win in 2013, visited the White House over the summer.\n\n\"How you framed that question — I would have framed that question like: 'You got a chance to go visit with the president, man. What was that experience like?'\" Harbaugh said in response to a reporter asking him about visiting with President Trump, who had been critical of Baltimore.\n\n\"It was amazing. It was awesome. And I promise you I root for our president. I want our president to be successful just like I want my quarterback to be successful and I want my team to be successful, and it was an amazing experience.\"\n\nHis brother, Jim Harbaugh, has met more U.S. Presidents.\n\n\"He's got seven, I got four. I had a chance to meet President Obama twice — incredible experience. Had a chance to meet President Biden when he was vice president in Iraq, and spent a lot of time with him in Iraq,\" he said. \"Jim got invited also to the White House to meet President Reagan because he was a Heisman Trophy candidate. We got to go as a family, so I met President Reagan — have a picture in my office of that.\"",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots have smashed preseason expectations in head coach Mike Vrabel’s first year.\n\nThey secured the AFC’s No. 2 seed and will host the Los Angeles Chargers at Gillette Stadium in the Wildcard round on Sunday.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it will be second-year quarterback Drake Maye’s NFL postseason debut. But it will be far from Maye’s first truly meaningful game.\n\nIn 2022, the then-20-year-old quarterback squared off with the college football juggernauts that are the Clemson Tigers in the ACC Conference Championship game.\n\nIt was Maye’s sophomore year at the University of North Carolina, and he had brought the Tar Heels to a 9-3 record and a top-25 ranking.\n\nMaye was asked during his Wednesday afternoon press conference what he learned from that experience.\n\n“Maybe a little bit,” Maye said when asked if that college experience correlates to his NFL playoff debut. “Getting back to trying to play for championships… I think it’s a little bit different in the NFL.\n\n“Just the mentality of ‘win or go home’ or ‘win and advance,’ and I think that’s the biggest thing that’s different. In the ACC Championship, you go to a bowl game. Here it’s (win) now, or you’re going home.”\n\nMaye was unable to win the conference championship in 2022, and, as he alluded to, earned a second chance in a game against Bo Nix’s 15th-ranked Oregon Ducks.\n\nMaye threw for 206 yards and three touchdowns in the 2022 Holiday Bowl. He led his team to a 24-10 fourth-quarter lead and added three points on his final drive of the game.\n\nThe defense was unable to stop the Ducks’ two-minute drill as Nix threw the game-winning touchdown with 19 seconds on the clock and beat the Tar Heels 28-27.\n\nDrake Maye Silences Emerging Narrative About Patriots-Chargers Matchup",

    "fullText": "After 18 seasons, the Baltimore Ravens decided to move on from future Hall of Fame coach John Harbaugh, who won 180 games and a Super Bowl. He’s undoubtedly the best head coaching candidate available in a league that now has seven vacancies, including the Ravens.\n\nThe Ravens fired Harbaugh so they could hire someone else. Now, another NFL team is reportedly weighing the decision to fire its coach and hire Harbaugh. But which team it is remains unclear.\n\nAccording to Harbaugh’s agent Bryan Harlan, Harbaugh’s availability has already prompted seven calls from NFL teams that have interest in the former Ravens coach. Yet again, only seven teams have vacancies, and the Ravens obviously aren’t calling to say they want him back now.\n\nThis means there’s another team that has yet to move on their head coach, who is currently pondering a switcheroo. That is, if Harbaugh’s agent is telling the truth.\n\nOf course, it’s his job to drive up the price for his client and make it seem like he’s the best thing since sliced bread. Still, it’s not that hard to believe that a team could be interested in upgrading to Harbaugh, who ranks 14th on the NFL’s all-time coaching wins list.\n\nThere’s still speculation that the Pittsburgh Steelers and Mike Tomlin could be headed for a split. How fun would it be for Harbaugh to head to one of the Ravens’ biggest rivals? After all, he knows this division like the back of his hand.\n\nIf not the Steelers, what about a team like the New York Jets? They can’t be too sold on Aaron Glenn after a 3-14 season. Possibly even the Miami Dolphins after Mike McDaniel’s poor start to the 2025 NFL campaign. Though, since McDaniel’s been involved in the GM hiring process, that would be an awkward split.\n\nWe don’t imagine the Indianapolis Colts are thinking about a coaching change after Shane Steichen proved he could lead a dominant effort with improved QB play, even if it was just for a stretch of the season. Yet, anything’s possible.\n\nWould the Washington Commanders consider a change after the bottom fell out on Dan Quinn’s team after they lost eight games in a row? A year after reaching the NFC Conference Championship, we doubt Quinn’s job is in danger this offseason.\n\nThat leaves the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who have been pretty silent on the future of Todd Bowles, though he believes he deserves a shot at another season. After seeing the offense and defense regress and failing to take control of a division that was clearly up for grabs, perhaps the Buccaneers are a team that’s silently pondering a change.\n\nIn any event, this unknown team is operating in the shadows. But quietly, they’re likely hoping Harbaugh says yes to them before moving on from the coach they’re already committed to.\n\nWith Harbaugh shaking things up, could there soon be eight NFL head coaching vacancies, leaving a quarter of the jobs up for grabs? Would that then spur someone like Bill Belichick’s interest?\n\nBill Belichick Addresses Rumored Interest in NFL Head Coaching Vacancies\n\nNY Giants Must Stop Flirting With Kevin Stefanski, Hire John Harbaugh Right Now\n\nNew York Giants Spending Lots of Time With Top Coaching Candidate",

By ground, No. 38 broke off 131 rushing yards and a pair of visits to the end zone. By air, he added 22 receiving yards and another score on a sluggo route.\n\nLongs of 56 and 35 yards were among them for Stevenson. The starting back would be the lone player around the league to log three touchdowns from scrimmage in Week 18. He finished with 104 rushing yards over expectation, per Next Gen Stats, and was charted by Pro Football Focus for forcing four missed tackles on his handoffs.\n\nIt marks the first weekly honor for the No. 120 overall pick in the 2021 NFL draft. A former transfer from Cerritos College to the University of Oklahoma, Stevenson checks in as the first Sooners product to win AFC or NFC Offensive Player of the Week this campaign. He joins nine-time winner Adrian Peterson and four-time winner Joe Mixon in the school’s archives at running back.\n\nBetween all three phases, Stevenson is also the sixth different member of the Patriots to get such a call this season.\n\nThe conference’s No. 2 seed was previously represented by kickoff returner Antonio Gibson in Week 2, punt returner Marcus Jones in Week 4, outside linebacker K’Lavon Chaisson in Week 7, kicker Andy Borregales in Week 12 and quarterback Drake Maye in Week 13.\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers visit head coach Mike Vrabel’s group in Foxborough on Sunday.

    "description": "The Kansas City Chiefs could upgrade their wide receiver room by selecting Georgia State Panthers star Ted Hurst in the 2026 NFL draft.",
    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs used significant draft picks on wide receivers in recent years but need to invest in the position during the 2026 NFL draft. With Marquise Brown, Travis Kelce, JuJu Smith-Schuster and Tyquan Thornton all entering free agency, the team desperately needs another quality pass catcher capable of elevating the offense.\n\nGeorgia State Panthers wide receiver Ted Hurst is a more well-rounded receiver than Thornton and more explosive than Smith-Schuster. His 6’3”, 195 lbs. frame also separates him from existing members of the Chiefs wide receiver room. Hurst projects as a top 100 selection who should grow into a contributor by the mid-point of his rookie season.\n\nHurst explodes off the line of scrimmage and displays the agile footwork to work across the faces of cornerbacks during his release. He lacks elite speed but uses his initial burst to overtake and stack cornerbacks. While Hurst’s speed isn’t special, he succeeded in stretching the field and generating chunk gains with his long strides at Georgia State.\n\nGeorgia State WR Ted Hurst is my #1 offensive prospect from the G5. \n\n- 6’3/195 \n- goal line fade machine\n- crisp route runner with sudden deceleration\n- elusive after the catch (17 mtkl forced this year)\n- burst to stack press-man\n- good not great top gear\n- cuts routes off vs.… pic.twitter.com/LvUgymsCJO\n\n— James Foster (@NoFlagsFilm) November 15, 2025\n\nDespite being a taller receiver, Hurst sinks his hips well at the top of the route stem and executes effective cuts and route fakes. His route definition occasionally suffers on digs, but he generates natural separation on curls and comebacks.\n\nHurst regularly finds open space against zone coverage and runs his routes to precise depths to move the chains. His work against press coverage needs to improve. The Georgia native is lean and lacks the play strength to power through jams at the line of scrimmage. This makes it easier for cornerbacks to re-route him and impact the timing of the offense’s plays.\n\nHurst caught 61.1% of his contested targets over the past two years. He isn’t a bully at the catch point but tracks the ball well and makes great adjustments to secure receptions through contact. Hurst drops easier receptions due to lapses of concentration, but he dials in for contested opportunities.\n\nHurst lacks the mass and power to break tackles after the catch, but his long strides and agility make him a threat to find open space and gash defenses. He uses jump cuts and his springy footwork to evade defenders while probing for room to run.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: 2026 NFL draft scouting report: Georgia State Panthers WR Ted Hurst",

On Tuesday, one potential answer officially entered the conversation when Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson announced via Instagram that he will declare for the 2026 NFL Draft after his first season as the Crimson Tide’s full-time starter.\n\nSimpson authored a standout campaign at Alabama, leading the SEC in completions (305) while throwing for 3,567 yards and accounting for 30 total touchdowns to just five interceptions. He guided the Crimson Tide to their first College Football Playoff victory since 2021 with a win over Oklahoma, though his postseason run ended on a sour note after he struggled and exited with an injury in Alabama’s quarterfinal loss.\n\nTy Simpson was super active pre-snap v. LSU. His pre-snap recognition was a consistent strength.\n\nSenses the impending blitz here. As soon as he sees the nickel coming, he knows the safety spacing is too wide to account for the sit route inside the slot fade. Places it perfectly. pic.twitter.com/7OAkE2g4QX\n\n— Ian Cummings (@IC_Draft) November 11, 2025\n\nDespite that setback, Simpson’s draft stock remains strong. ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. currently ranks Simpson as the No. 3 quarterback in the incoming class, slotting him behind Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza and Oregon’s Dante Moore — both of whom are competing in the College Football Playoff semifinals and have yet to officially declare.\n\nGiven Pittsburgh’s likely draft position, the Steelers are not expected to be realistic contenders for Mendoza or Moore, making Simpson an especially compelling name to watch as draft season approaches. His blend of production, poise, and experience against elite competition has already sparked conversation around Pittsburgh as the organization evaluates succession plans behind Rodgers. There are, however, concerns about his lack of experience and durability.\n\nThe timing only adds to the intrigue. The 2026 NFL Draft will be held in Pittsburgh, placing the franchise firmly in the national spotlight as it navigates one of the most consequential roster decisions of the coming era.\n\nWhether Simpson ultimately becomes the next quarterback to don black and gold remains to be seen. But as the offseason begins to take shape, his declaration ensures the Steelers — and their fans — will be paying close attention.",

    "description": "Jason Logan's NFL Wild Card Weekend Underdog predictions are backing the Bears and Steelers.",
    "fullText": "The NFL Playoffs have been ripe with underdog winners in recent years. Over the last five postseasons, playoff pups cover the spread at a 60% clip.\n\nThe Wild Card Round used to be one of the best slates to take the points. However, the “Super” Wild Card Weekend – with six games on the board instead of four - has been “Super Mild” in terms of underdog success.\n\nIn the seven playoffs before stretching the field to 14 teams, Wild Card dogs were 19-8-1 ATS – a 70% ATS windfall. Since expanding the bracket, pups have barely barked at 16-14 ATS over the last five postseasons.\n\nWith the field a little “watered down,” you can’t just blindly bag up all the underdogs and hope for the best. You must be more selective when it comes to taking the points with your NFL Wild Card picks and predictions.\n\nHere are my best underdog NFL picks for this year’s “Super” Wild Card Weekend.\n\nRegular season: 31-21-2 ATS (+6.73 units)\n\nBest bet: Chicago Bears +1.5\n(-120 at Caesars Sportsbook)\n\nThe Chicago Bears backed into the postseason on a two-game slide but were playing their best football down the stretch. The offense, more specifically, has looked great.\n\nThis is a Top-5 attack in terms of EPA per play since Week 12, with a two-headed monster forming at running back (D’Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai) and really giving Ben Johnson’s playbook dimension.\n\nChicago grinded for 99 yards or more on the ground in the six games before Week 18’s flop against the Lions, topping 130 rushing yards in four of those games, including 138 and 150 yards in two matchups with the Green Bay Packers.\n\nThe Packers’ once-mighty defense has been decimated by injuries, most notably along the defensive line. Green Bay has been bullied in the trenches, watching foes roll for a 48% success rate per handoff since Week 12 (31st). It’ll get pushed around by Chicago’s elite offensive line, which could be the best in the NFC.\n\nWinning the \"turf war\" makes life easier for everyone in Chitown.\n\nThose ground gains set up for shorter third downs, activate Johnson’s vaunted play-action schemes, make the Packers’ soft secondary vulnerable to random deep shots, and chew up possession, which then boosts the Bears defense and forces Green Bay to be one-dimensional with limited offensive touches.\n\nBest bet: Pittsburgh Steelers +3.5\n(-110 at BetRivers)\n\nRegardless of how they got there, the Pittsburgh Steelers are in the playoffs.\n\nThe Steelers are hosting a Houston Texans team in one of the toughest venues in all of sports. Acrisure Stadium will undoubtedly be loud and cold, with temperatures that “feel like” sub-freezing on Monday night.\n\nThe Texans are all about that defense, entering the postseason with the top-ranked stop unit in the land. But to cover the spread, you need to put some points on the board. That’s been challenging for C.J. Stroud & Co. – at least when venturing into the great outdoors.\n\nHouston averages less than 22 points per game in open-air venues and only 19.8 per road game – a 7.5-point slide compared to its production at home. Stroud is notoriously an “indoor cat,\" with his career passer rating, completion percentage, and yards per attempt all taking a nosedive outside.\n\nThe Texans’ offensive line is still an area of concern. While Houston has better protected Stroud this season, this group is still 21st in pass block win rate at ESPN, 22nd in pass block rating at PFF, and has allowed Stroud to feel pressure on almost 22% of dropbacks with the 12th most QB hurries allowed.\n\nPittsburgh’s bread and butter has always been chaos. That comes in the form of a pass rush that brings the blitz at the fourth-highest rate and sits Top 10 in both QB hits and sacks.\n\nStroud’s passing performances take a knock versus blitz-heavy schemes, with less time for deeper plays to develop. Houston went just 4-4 ATS as a visitor and, of course, you can't discount Mike Tomlin as a home underdog: 23-9-3 ATS since 2007 (70%).\n\nMy NFL Underdogs column is 31-21-2 ATS this season for +6.73 units.\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

Patriots’ Stefon Diggs Makes Reference to Bad Macaroni and Cheese After Being Accused of Strangling His Chef \"Not once has that woman said anything to me about being touched.. NOT ONCE!!,\" the rapper wrote. \"Mind you, we was talking every single day until she left that house and she JUST wrote me this.. but I’m gonna let the courts handle s*** and when it gets handled I want all yall talkin s*** on your f***in knees with apologies just as loud the way yall been harassing over a lie… and I put that on my two month old son in the name of the lord!! That’s how confident I am.\" News broke on Tuesday, December 30, that Diggs was charged with felony strangulation or suffocation and misdemeanor assault and battery over the alleged incident with the chef, which she claimed happened at his home on December 2. The police report referenced Diggs’ \"girlfriend,\" leading some to speculate it was referring to Cardi. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MAY 12: Stefon Diggs and Cardi B celebrate after Game Four of the Eastern Conference Second Round NBA Playoffs between the Boston Celtics and the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on May 12, 2025 in New York City. Elsa/Getty Images After the chef contacted police she said she “received a voice mail and text messages from a female that she believed to be Diggs girlfriend.” “The messages stated something to the effect of ‘you don’t need to do all this. It’s not that big of a deal,’” the report said. Cardi and Diggs have been linked since late 2024. The couple welcomed their first baby, a son, in November. Us Weekly has reached out to Cardi’s lawyer for comment. Diggs’ attorney, David Meier, said his client “categorically denies” the allegations in a statement to Us on December 30. Patriots Star Stefon Diggs’ Alleged Text Messages Revealed With Woman Accusing Him of Strangulation “They are unsubstantiated, uncorroborated and were never investigated — because they did not occur,” the statement said. “The timing and motivation for making the allegations is crystal clear: They are the direct result of an employee-employer financial dispute that was not resolved to the employee’s satisfaction. Stefon looks forward to establishing the truth in a court of law.” Diggs returned to the field on Sunday, January 4, as the Patriots hosted the Miami Dolphins in their regular season finale. The franchise has pledged their support to Diggs in the aftermath of the charges. “Stefon has informed the organization that he categorically denies the allegations. We support Stefon,” the team said in a statement on December 30. “We will continue to gather information and will cooperate fully with the appropriate authorities and the NFL as necessary. Out of respect for all parties involved, and given that this is an ongoing legal matter, we will have no further comment at this time.” The Patriots host the Los Angeles Chargers in the NFL Wild Card Round on Sunday, January 11.",

    "fullText": "Longest tenured NFL head coaches: Mike Tomlin, Andy Reid lead list after John Harbaugh's Ravens firing originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nVery few NFL head coaches last longer than a few years with one team, and even then, most don’t get to finish on their own terms.\n\nA handful of current head coaches have bucked that trend and made themselves fixtures with one team, even if no coaching stint is ever permanent.\n\nHere’s a look at the NFL’s longest-tenured head coaches after John Harbaugh’s firing as Baltimore Ravens coach.\n\nMORE:Why the Ravens fired John Harbaugh after 18 years\n\nHere are the eight longest tenured active NFL head coaches:\n\nMike Tomlin is the NFL’s longest-tenured coach and has been since Bill Belichick and the New England Patriots parted ways after the 2023 season. Hired to replace a retiring Bill Cowher in early 2007, Tomlin has never had a losing season in 19 years as head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers and has guided the team to two Super Bowl appearances, including a win in his second season. If Tomlin decides to stick around for 2026, he will reach two decades with the Steelers.\n\nIt's hard to believe the NFL's second longest tenured coach could have another head coaching stint that matches his current one, but Andy Reid is heading into his 14th season with the Kansas City Chiefs after 14 years with the Philadelphia Eagles. Hired to bring some stability after a tumultuous 2012 season, Reid has beaten all expectations with the Chiefs, guiding the team to three Super Bowl wins and five AFC championships with Patrick Mahomes at quarterback after a strong first five years on the job.\n\nNo Buffalo Bills coach since Marv Levy had lasted more than four seasons until Sean McDermott came along. McDermott replaced Rex Ryan in 2017 and immediately guided the Bills to their first playoff appearance in 18 years, a preview of some of the success to come with Josh Allen at quarterback. While getting to the Super Bowl is still just a goal for McDermott, he has been one of the NFL's winningest coaches since he was hired in Buffalo.\n\nMORE:Ranking the 6 best candidates to replace John Harbaugh\n\nIf you could start an NFL team today, there likely aren’t many — or any — coaches you would take over Sean McVay. A little-known 30-year-old wunderkind when the Los Angeles Rams hired him to replace Jeff Fisher in 2017, McVay led an instant turnaround of a downtrodden franchise and took the Rams to the Super Bowl in his second season. He reached the pinnacle with a Super Bowl win in his fifth season, and his tenure in L.A. seems more likely to end on his terms than the team’s when all is said and done.\n\nAfter a bumpy first two seasons in San Francisco, Kyle Shanahan established himself as one of the NFL's premier coaches and has taken the 49ers to the Super Bowl twice in nine seasons on the job. Shanahan has navigated near-constant injuries and turned Brock Purdy into a franchise quarterback, making a Super Bowl ring just about all that eludes the franchise during his tenure.\n\nMORE: Ranking all 14 teams' chances at winning Super Bowl 60\n\nHere are the five longest head coaching stints in NFL history, headlined by a pair of legends.\n\nIf Tomlin continues on as head coach of the Steelers in 2026, he will still need to coach the team through the 2030 season to match Belichick's 24-year run with the Patriots and through the 2035 season to tie the all-time mark of 29 years.\n\nJohn Harbaugh's four best landing spots\n\nRevisiting last Ravens coach before John Harbaugh\n\nHow Ravens firing John Harbaugh impacts Lamar Jackson's future",

    "fullText": "Which team suits Jeremiyah Love in this years upcoming NFL draft originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAs the 2026 NFL Draft approaches, one name rising quickly on scouts’ boards is Notre Dame’s dynamic running back, Jeremiyah Love. Considered a top prospect and projected as a potential first-round pick, Love is generating significant buzz due to his rare combination of size, speed, and versatility. Mock drafts frequently link him to teams like the New Orleans Saints, Kansas City Chiefs, and Minnesota Vikings, with other franchises such as the New York Giants, Jets, and Arizona Cardinals also reportedly interested.\n\nStanding out at 6-foot-1 and around 220 pounds, Love combines downhill power running with breakaway speed, making him a threat between the tackles and in the open field. His 2025 season was remarkable; he set Notre Dame’s single-season touchdown record, proving his ability to find the end zone with consistency.\n\nBut Love isn’t just a runner. He’s a polished receiver out of the backfield, frequently lining up as a wide option and showing great hands and route-running ability. This dual-threat skill set is essential in today’s NFL, where running backs must impact the passing game as much as the ground game. Love’s willingness and ability as a pass protector further increase his value, showing he can handle the complexities of NFL blocking schemes.\n\nOne of the teams most commonly associated with Love in mock drafts is the New Orleans Saints. The Saints have a strong quarterback in place and a talented receiving corps, including Chris Olave, but lack a true star running back. Love would bring a new dimension to their offense with his downhill running style and receiving skills. The Saints also need to bolster their offensive line, but Love’s versatility would allow them to maximize their existing weapons.\n\nSimilarly, the Kansas City Chiefs could be an ideal landing spot. Pairing Love with Patrick Mahomes would provide a dynamic, multi-dimensional offensive threat capable of creating mismatches against defenses. The Minnesota Vikings, looking to rejuvenate their backfield, also make sense given Love’s potential to be a long-term solution in their offense.\n\nThe debate about drafting running backs in the first round remains lively. While some analysts are cautious due to the importance of offensive line play, recent first-round backs like Bijan Robinson and Jahmyr Gibbs have proven how impactful the position can be with the right supporting cast. Saquon Barkley, another top-10 running back pick, demonstrated his full potential only after moving to Philadelphia, highlighting how situational fit is crucial.\n\nLove fits the mold of a first-round back who can immediately influence a team’s offensive identity. His combination of power, speed, and receiving ability offers a unique weapon that can change the way defenses prepare.\n\nUltimately, Jeremiyah Love is more than just a running back; he is a multi-faceted offensive weapon ready to make an immediate impact in the NFL. While some teams may hesitate to use a first-round pick on a running back due to positional value debates, Love’s talent and fit with teams in need could see him selected in the top 15 or even top 10.\n\nIf the Saints or Chiefs decide to prioritize offense in the early rounds, Love’s name will be among the first called a player who can bring explosiveness and versatility to an NFL offense hungry for game-changers. His draft stock continues to rise, and many believe he could redefine the value of the running back position in 2026.\n\nOregon's Dan Lanning rips College Football Playoff, calls for major changes\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nTop 2026 NFL Draft prospect suffers broken rib in CFP quarterfinal loss\n\nESPN's grade for LSU hiring Lane Kiffin will make Ole Miss fans even more mad\n\nDabo Swinney fires Clemson coaches immediately after loss to Penn State\n\nOhio State's Ryan Day faces backlash after Cotton Bowl",

    "fullText": "With six head-coaching openings in the NFL, and possibly more, Bill Belichick's name will be mentioned publicly for one or more of the jobs. Whether he's privately considered for any of them remains to be seen.\n\nAppearing on the Let’s Go! podcast, Belichick was asked by host Jim Gray whether Belichick is interested in returning to the NFL.\n\n“Nothing's changed,\" Belichick said. \"I’m where I was a month ago. I'm here at North Carolina. I really appreciate the love and support that we've gotten from the community down here, from the school, from Chancellor Roberts, the ADs, Bubba Cunningham, Steve Newmark, working with Mike Lombardi and our staff here. We're building a good program and I'm excited about the direction we're headed in.”\n\nIt wasn't a \"no.\" But it's not relevant until someone wants to talk to him.\n\nSince being fired two years ago, he has had one interview, with the Falcons. The Falcons are looking again, with a clean slate (for now) in the front office.\n\nWould owner Arthur Blank want to give Belichick another look, periodic trolling by Jordon Hudson notwithstanding? While it's unclear where his coaching skills currently reside (e.g., would Belichick put a defensive coach in charge of the offense?), we're confident that Belichick wouldn't have given $100 million guaranteed to Kirk Cousins before using a top-10 pick on Michael Penix Jr. if he'd been the Atlanta coach in 2024.\n\nBelichick is currently on the board for five existing vacancies: +4000 for the Giants, +8000 for the Titans, +4000 for the Browns, +1200 for the Falcons, and +1600 for the Raiders. (DraftKings doesn't have odds for the Cardinals' job, for some reason.)\n\nA team will first need to be interested in Belichick. And he'd need to be interested in the team. (Belichick expressed to Gray disdain for teams that use search firms, which could make the search firm running the Falcons' search less inclined to seek him out.)\n\nLast year, when it became clear to Belichick that he wouldn't get a job in the 2025 cycle, he went to North Carolina. Lombardi thereafter questioned whether there are any good jobs in the NFL, while also explaining that he and Belichick prefer working in college football.\n\nMost of the jobs that come open are open for a reason. Still, if Belichick wants to catch Don Shula for the all-time wins record, no number of victories at UNC will matter.",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M's offensive line will look very different in 2026, as head coach Mike Elko and O-line coach Adam Cushing will need to replace four starters, now including junior left guard Chase Bisontis, who has officially declared for the 2026 NFL Draft after three successful seasons in College Station.\n\nA New Jersey native, Bisontis chose the Aggies over Rutgers in the 2023 recruiting class, bringing elite size and versatility at 6'5\" and 315 pounds, and during his first season with the Aggies, Bisontis started at right tackle amid former head coach Jimbo Fisher's final season at the helm.\n\nAfter Fisher was dismissed, Mike Elko felt that Adam Cushing was the perfect choice to help Bisontis reach his full potential, slotting him at left guard, where he has dominated ever since. Logging 1,962 snaps in his Texas A&M career, including 795 snaps, all at left guard during the 2025 season. Bisontis's elite strength will quickly translate to the next level, knowing that NFL scouts see him as a \"plug-and-play\" option at left or right guard.\n\nPro Football Focus graded Bisontis as an above-average pass protector (70.7) and average run blocker (62.7). Still, these grades, compared to most SEC starting guards, prove the level of defensive competition within the conference.\n\nOver the last three days, Texas A&M landed commitments from LSU transfer guard Coen Echols and South Carolina guard Trovon Baugh, which now makes even more sense given today's news. Needing size and SEC experience at left and right guard is key to avoiding a substantial drop-off in the trenches, and credit to Mike Elko for preparing for the inevitable.\n\nTexas A&M OL Chase Bisontis has declared for the 2026 NFL Draft, per his Instagram (chase_bisontis) 👍 #GigEm @CBisontis pic.twitter.com/iQfPNJsSQI\n\n— Luke Evangelist (@lukeevangelist_) January 6, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M star OL Chase Bisontis has declared for the 2026 NFL Draft",

    "fullText": "The Athletic has live coverage of Bears vs. 49ers on NFL “Sunday Night Football.”\n\nGood morning! Keep your job today. Inside:\n\nEvery moment of the past two years has felt like an inflection point for women’s basketball in America. Viewership is surging. Will they capitalize?\n\nIt kind of defeats the entire definition of an inflection point, but if there really is one, the sport has arrived at its doorstep now. Consider:\n\nThe WNBA, after a spike in popularity, is undergoing a contentious negotiation for a new collective bargaining agreement. Salaries and revenue are set to explode. The question is just how the players and league will agree to share the boom.\n\nThe sport’s rise has manifested in other ways. As recently as a couple years ago, it was standard for WNBA players — afforded meager salaries compared to those in other pro sports — to travel overseas to make big money during the offseason.\n\nEnter new leagues like Unrivaled, which opened its second season last night, and Project B, a new venture that will launch in November. While there are differences — Unrivaled is a three-on-three sport, while Project B is more akin to the full game but with a wide travel schedule — they offer similar things: more money, and player equity in the league.\n\nUnrivaled started its sophomore year with four games last night, highlighted by the Mist, an expansion franchise, winning its first game, and Rose, the defending champions, winning by 20. My favorite bit about watching these games: The league uses a modified version of the Elam Ending, in which teams play three timed quarters, but the fourth quarter is untimed. The first team to reach a certain point total (11 points more than the leading team has after three quarters) wins.\n\nI asked Ben Pickman, who wrote an excellent preview of the Unrivaled year yesterday, about whether he thinks the league has a chance to make an imprint on the larger sports world this year:\n\n“Unrivaled already excels at creating social media content that puts WNBA players fully onto viewer radars during the winter. What will be interesting is how its viewership continues to grow and whether fans become more invested in the nightly results of its games. The league’s viewership on TNT and truTV in Year 1 was comparable to the NWSL’s viewership on ESPN networks this past season, and though it is far behind the WNBA’s viewership, the two leagues are of course at varying points in their history.”\n\nBen also made an interesting point to me: With the NBA off TNT, Paige Bueckers, who plays for the Breeze, is the second-most famous athlete broadcast by TNT Sports, behind only Shohei Ohtani.\n\nThese are exciting things. Let’s move on to something a little more dour:\n\nWe discussed the looming specter of “Black Monday” yesterday — the day most NFL coaches get fired. That part came to fruition. What we didn’t expect was the firings to extend beyond the American version of football.\n\nCleveland canned Kevin Stefanski after six years in charge, which saw two playoff appearances, a disastrous trade for Deshaun Watson and a sack record all achieved amid boggling highs and lows. Jason Lloyd writes that, despite those temporary highs, Stefanski leaves behind a lot of bad things.\n\nThe Cardinals fired Jonathan Gannon after three largely unsuccessful seasons. He finishes his tenure 15-36 with no playoff appearances. Tough timing after the team’s X account wished him a happy birthday Sunday.\n\nPete Carroll is officially one-and-done in Las Vegas, which feels like a sad line in what probably will be a Hall of Fame career (a convo for another day). General manager John Spytek, hired last offseason with Carroll, will remain in his role and help Tom Brady with the coaching search. What a weird year.\n\nWe’ll have to wait on movement for replacements, as plenty of those candidates are still coaching for playoff teams. One curious name to consider, though: Philip Rivers.\n\nNow, to the surprising news from across the ocean we briefly mentioned yesterday:\n\nManchester United is done with manager Ruben Amorim after a maddening 14-month tenure that began with lofty promise. Amorim’s critics viewed him as inflexible, though his tactics were successful elsewhere. Man Utd finished 15th in the Premier League table last season and sits sixth right now. One thing will be missed: Amorim’s bizarre news conferences.\n\nIn other soccer sacking news, Celtic parted with Wilfried Nancy after just 33 days in charge. He joined Dec. 3 after a stint with the Columbus Crew. His early dismissal set records.\n\nWoof. Let’s move on to some more … normal news.\n\nHawks, Young working on trade\n\nAtlanta and star guard Trae Young are discussing a possible trade, a source confirmed to The Athletic, which has been a long time coming on a few different levels. Young is still just 27 and in his prime, and still possesses the ability to be an elite scorer. But it’s very clear the Hawks are a better team without him this year, and he can enter free agency after the season. Read our full story here, which includes a potential suitor.\n\nMontana State wins wild FCS title game\n\nMontana State won its first FCS championship since 1984 last night, 35-34 over Illinois State, which had become the Cinderella of the FCS tournament bracket. The game itself was unhinged, and ended after the Bobcats converted a fourth-and-10 for a touchdown in overtime on a pass from quarterback Justin Lamson to Taco Dowler (sweet name). That was merely the caboose for what transpired in the minutes before. The full recap is worth a read.\n\nSweden outlasted Czechia to win its first World Juniors gold medal since 2012 yesterday. More details inside.\n\nIndiana and Alabama drew a record 23.9 million viewers for their Rose Bowl matchup. Yowza.\n\nDolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa is open to a fresh start with a new team. Hm.\n\nColts cornerback Charvarius Ward Sr. said yesterday he is considering retirement after suffering three concussions this season. Read the 29-year-old’s full comments.\n\nTough flip: Notre Dame quarterback Kenny Minchey is heading to Kentucky, just hours after he committed to Nebraska.\n\nF1 driver Checo Pérez said being Max Verstappen’s teammate at Red Bull was the “worst job.” Yikes.\n\n📺 NCAAM: Duke at Louisville\n\n7 p.m. ET on ESPN\n\nThe Blue Devils are ranked No. 6 and have the star power, while the Cardinals are No. 20 and still favored in this game. Sounds like a good sell to me.\n\n📺 NHL: Panthers at Maple Leafs\n\n7:30 p.m. ET on TNT and HBO Max\n\nThe defending champions have steadied a bit after a tough start to the season, while Toronto remains moribund, which has been a slow-burn surprise. \n\n📺 NBA: Heat at Timberwolves\n\n8 p.m. ET on NBC and Peacock\n\nThe best NBA game of the evening is here, and it’s funny that the 23-13 Timberwolves are flying under the proverbial radar a bit. Still great with a Tier 1 scorer, but sitting sixth in the West and biding time until the playoffs. Don’t sleep on them, though.\n\nGet tickets to games like these here.\n\nWe had a scheduling mix-up last week, for which we apologize. Here is the excellent story we promised you then: Katie Whyatt’s look at how sex workers have increasingly used European soccer clubs as sort of a brand boost on social media. Read it here.\n\nNick Baumgardner has a new 2026 NFL mock draft with Oregon QB Dante Moore going No. 1 to Las Vegas. Moore might be deciding between being the No. 1 pick and staying in college.\n\nDan Duggan tore into Giants ownership yesterday for retaining general manager Joe Schoen, arguing the franchise has “no standards anymore.” Make time for this one.\n\nImportant table-setter: Ken Rosenthal and Will Sammon update us on where the Cubs, Yankees and Blue Jays stand as the MLB offseason withers away.\n\nMost-clicked in the newsletter yesterday: NFL playoff schedule.\n\nMost-read on the website yesterday: Our projections of every NFL playoff team’s odds to win the Super Bowl.\n\n📫 That’s all for now!

    "fullText": "NFL playoff picks, predictions for AFC, NFC brackets and Super Bowl 60 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nBuckle up, folks — it's playoff season in the NFL.\n\nThe 2025 season was an abnormal one, and the postseason bracket exemplifies that. Both No. 1 seeds from last year — the Kansas City Chiefs and Detroit Lions — failed to make the playoffs, and the AFC is without Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow and Lamar Jackson.\n\nTeams such as the Seattle Seahawks, Denver Broncos, Jacksonville Jaguars, Chicago Bears and New England Patriots all took major leaps forward this year. The Seahawks and Broncos have the byes in each conference to the divisional round, with their defense propelling them to the top of the standings.\n\nBelow are Sporting News' predictions for the 2026 NFL playoffs, complete with updated Super Bowl 60 picks. Our NFL experts break down the brackets and project which players will break out, which contenders will break down, and which teams will break through during the postseason.\n\nNFL playoff power rankings, 1-14\n\nBill Bender: Buffalo Bills. Kansas City isn't in the way this year. Josh Allen is 7-2 against everybody else in the playoffs – but the only thing holding us back is that Buffalo will have to prove it on the road. Allen is 0-4 on the road in the postseason and the path starts at Jacksonville. The Jaguars have allowed more than 20 points one time through a seven-game win streak.\n\nDaniel Chavkin: The Houston Texans. The Texans are the hottest team in the NFL with a stifling defense and an offense that has found a rhythm. Quietly, Houston has won a playoff game in back-to-back seasons, giving them experience at the biggest stage that the top of this year's AFC field doesn't possess. If CJ Stroud plays to an efficient level, this team has the formula to win anywhere in January.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Los Angeles Rams. This might be rather obvious but they have a rejuvenated MVP-caliber Matthew Stafford at QB with Sean McVay as their coach, the combination that helped them win Super Bowl 56 with similar support from the receiving corps, defense and running game. They were also smart to drive for the No. 5 seed so they get the easiest road game early, before a potential toss-up rematch with the Seahawks\n\nDaniel Mader: The Buffalo Bills. The AFC bracket is loaded with up-and-coming, yet unproven quarterbacks — this is the best chance Josh Allen has ever had to reach the Super Bowl, even as a No. 6 seed. Buffalo’s five-loss record doesn’t concern me much, nor does the lack of a true WR1 or a defense that has struggled at times. With Allen, the Bills are capable of beating any team in the AFC.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: The Los Angeles Rams remain one of the most well-rounded teams in the NFL. A strong run game and the efforts of Davante Adams and Puka Nacua as wide receivers carry the offense. Adams missed the end of the regular season so that he could help up for the playoffs, and he is expected to be back. Los Angeles goes on the road to take on the Carolina Panthers in the first round, where the Rams lost 31-28 in Week 13. Still, the Rams are set up for an easy first-round matchup and should go on a deep run as long as they don't completely look past the Panthers in the first round.\n\nDavid Suggs: The Los AngelesRams. Special mention for the 49ers, Texans, Patriots, Jaguars, Bills and Eagles, all of whom could easily contend for a Super Bowl crown. But Los Angeles is a well-rounded unit that has gamers on both sides of the ball. The Rams are the NFL's most explosive offense and have enjoyed a fair few shutdown showings on defense.\n\nEd Williams: Los Angeles Rams. This team checks all of the boxes of a true Super Bowl threat. First and foremost, the Rams defeated the Bengals in Super Bowl 56 just a few years ago. While some key names like Cooper Kupp and Aaron Donald are missing from that squad, younger playmakers like Puka Nacua and Jared Verse have risen to prominence since then. Matthew Stafford is an MVP favorite, and Davante Adams as emerged as a favorite red zone target. And Sean McVay is widely considered one of the best coaches in the league. The defense can give up yards and points, but they're also dynamic and capable of forcing turnovers at any time. As far as wild-card teams go, no one is looking forward to the Rams coming to town.\n\nBill Bender: Philadelphia Eagles. The Jaguars are an underdog and the Bears line against the Packers will be short either way. Those are not upsets. The 49ers – despite all the injuries – still have a defense that ranked 11th against the run. Brock Purdy had a 111 passer rating on the road. Philadelphia finished 5-3 at home this season – and that included a 1-2 record against playoff teams. Will the Super Bowl champions be an early exit?\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Philadelphia Eagles. The defending champions have had a rocky season, winning the NFC East on the backs of a strong defense. But the offensive issues have persisted throughout the season and remain a problem entering the playoffs. While the defense is one of the best, the Eagles will have to find a way to score consistently in order to make it back to the Super Bowl. With a tough 49ers team on tap first, the Eagles offensive concerns could send them home quickly.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Chicago Bears. They've been living on the edge with some low-scoring games and fourth-quarter comebacks. It's been a massive breakthrough season all around with Caleb Williams and Ben Johnson, but they can be in trouble right away vs. the Packers if they don't get the turnovers to bounce in their favor.\n\nDaniel Mader: The Chicago Bears. Ben Johnson has clearly elevated this franchise in every way it hoped he would, and this has been a terrific Bears season that offers plenty of hope for the future. But I do think some one-score luck played a big role in Chicago’s 11-6 record, and I question how sustainable it is. Anything can happen in divisional games. I buy the Packers’ playoff experience over the Bears.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: No disrespect to the Jacksonville Jaguars; they have had an incredible bounce-back season. Looking at the first-round matchups for the top teams, though, Jacksonville will have to host Buffalo. The Bills went 12-5 this season and that was playing well below their potential. Yes, Buffalo has to hit the road, but if it all comes together for them as it can and Josh Allen looks like the player who won the MVP Award last season, it could easily be an early postseason exit for the Jaguars.\n\nDavid Suggs: The Denver Broncos. Denver enjoyed a wondrous campaign under Sean Payton and its defense is arguably the NFL's best, surrendering the third-fewest points in the league. But there's reason to believe the Broncos' luck could be running out. They were 11-2 in one-score games this season, a record that, while impressive, could be hard to maintain against the AFC's best sides. Bo Nix still leaves something to be desired and the Broncos' toils against teams like the Jets, Giants, Raiders and Commanders suggests they're not quite the juggernaut their record would initially indicate.\n\nEd Williams: Jacksonville Jaguars. The turnaround Liam Coen has pulled off in Jacksonville is impressive, and he probably should be getting more attention for Coach of the Year. But unfortunately for them, they draw Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills. Some of the game's biggest names at QB will be missing from the postseason this year like Patrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson, but the reigning MVP is back as a 12-5 No. 6 seed. While his receiving weapons won't instill fear into opposing defenses themselves, Allen's ability to take over a game at any moment certainly can cause sleepless nights. And on top of that, James Cook was the league's leading rusher and gives them another threat to break off chunk plays. Trevor Lawrence will have to keep his hot streak going to keep pace with Allen, and the much-improved Jags defense will need to prove this isn't the same old Jags. It's not an impossible task, but the Jags likely would have preferred to see the Chargers or Texans.\n\nBill Bender: Bills QB Josh Allen. Matthew Stafford and Drake Maye are acceptable answers – and the potential for a third matchup between the Bills and Patriots could be in the cards. Allen has everything but a Super Bowl appearance on his resume at this point. It's time to change that.\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Will Anderson: Ten years ago, Von Miller capped his incredible playoff run with a Super Bowl in San Francisco, providing a blueprint for Will Anderson. If it weren't for Myles Garrett's record-breaking season, Anderson would be among the favorites to win Defensive Player of the Year, as his career-high 12 sacks sparked the Texans defense to the top of the NFL. With a few of the top quarterbacks sitting at home, it will be a defensive player shining the brightest in January.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence. There's every reason to believe he will keep this hot streak groove in full command of Liam Coen's balanced and explosive offense into the playoffs. The Bills' defense has plenty of holes to exploit in the wild-card round and he's already proved he can rip Denver's defense. He will keep breaking out on delay as the No. 1 pick talent he was supposed to be, five years after he was drafted.\n\nDaniel Mader: The man who can still be considered the reigning league MVP, Josh Allen. Buffalo’s star quarterback seemed to get better as the regular season went on, and I think he’ll continue that trend into the postseason without any Patrick Mahomes-shaped ghosts to worry about. Allen can be considered the most dynamic individual talent in the 2026 playoffs.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: Drake Maye and head coach Mike Vrabel seem like the perfect marriage, poised to be a threat in the AFC for years to come. Just when the league got past the dominance of New England, this duo is bringing it back. Maye can run Vrabel's offense, and the defensive-minded head coach can focus on what he knows best. Maye might miss out on the regular-season MVP Award, but he has a great chance to win playoff MVP because he likely won't be benched in the third quarter because of huge leads.\n\nDavid Suggs:Puka Nacua. If the Rams are to win the Super Bowl, their third-year pass-catcher will be among the biggest reasons why. Nacua is as steady as they come, finding success against both man and zone coverages. I reckon he'll keep the good times rolling during the playoffs.\n\nEd Williams: Jalen Hurts. The Eagles offense has not exactly been a thing of beauty during the regular season, but Jalen Hurts has a habit of playing his best football when the lights are brightest. Passing game struggles were a common issue in 2024 as well, but when the playoffs came around, the Eagles seemed to flip a switch and were airing it out seemingly at will. Last year they also had a historic season from Saquon Barkley in the running game. That has not been the case in 2025, as the offensive line has struggled mightily. If the Eagles offense is going to flip a switch again, it's likely going to have to be Jalen Hurts. The weapons are there with A.J. Brown, DeVonte Smith and Barkley, plus tight end Dallas Goedert has evolved into a deadly red zone target. The Eagles offense is at its best when Jalen Hurts is also hurting defenses with his legs, and now that they're in the postseason and it's win or go home, look for him to run more often than he did during the regular season. The playcalling and sequencing from rookie offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo hasn't done Hurts any favors this season, but the reigning Super Bowl MVP can block out all the noise and silence his doubters once and for all if he can lead Philly back to the promised land.\n\nBill Bender: Rams defensive end Jared Verse. Verse had five pressures or \n\nDaniel Chavkin: RJ Harvey. Fantasy players know how talented RJ Harvey is, but it's time for the rookie to break out in the biggest moment. The Broncos offense will need Harvey to provide a spark in the running game and give Bo Nix a reliable back, allowing them to make a run to the Super Bowl. Harvey didn't surpass 75 yards in any game during his rookie season, but expect that to change once Denver takes the field in January.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Patriots edge rusher Harold Landry. The former Titan has been more impactful down the stretch rushing the passer for Mike Vrabel and he can be a more disruptive defensive force the team needs against better QBs in the playoffs.\n\nDaniel Mader: I’ll throw out a pair of Jaguars offensive weapons here: wide receiver Parker Washington and tight end Brenton Strange. While Jacksonville gets a tough first-round matchup against Buffalo, I’ve found it impressive how Trevor Lawrence has continued to thrive despite Brian Thomas Jr. not being the same talent as 2024 and Travis Hunter’s season ending early. Washington and Strange can make a bigger name for themselves if they help the Jags take down the Bills.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: Seahawks linebacker Ernest Jones IV led Seattle with 126 total tackles on the year. He is a beast in coverage and it is hard for any runner to get past him when he goes to tackle them. Jones has had a phenomenal year when dropping into pass coverage too. He has seven passes defended and leads Seattle with an impressive five interceptions, the second-most by any player in the NFL this year. You've likely heard of rookie safety Nick Emmanwori for Seattle, but be ready to get to know Jones.\n\nDavid Suggs:Woody Marks. The Texans' rookie numbers don't necessarily pop off the page at first glance. But he established himself as Houston's No. 1 tailback as the season wore on, tallying 15 or more carries in five of his last seven games. Marks is a gifted pass-catcher in space whose elusiveness figures to cause problems for opposition defenses. He should prove to be one of C.J. Stroud's favorite safety blankets.\n\nEd Williams: Eagles linebacker Jalyx Hunt spent three years at Cornell playing safety before transferring to Houston Christian University, where he transitioned to a linebacker/EDGE player. The Eagles drafted him in the third round at pick 94, which seemed like it might have been a reach at the time. But Hunt's development in Vic Fangio's system has been something to behold. He flashed some serious potential in his limited opportunities as a rookie, but after the Eagles let Josh Sweat walk in free agency and with Brandon Graham's retirement and Nolan Smith's triceps injury to start the season, Hunt was thrust into a starting role. Hunt was thrown right into the deep end, and he's really excelled in the expanded role. He leads the team in pressures (55), QB hits (24), sacks (6.5) and interceptions (3). In fact, he leads all EDGE rushers in the NFL with three picks. His 21.2% pressure rate on third down is 8th among NFL EDGE rushers this year. He's the only player in the history of the Eagles franchise to lead the team in both INTs and sacks. The Eagles can bring pressure in many ways, but Hunt just seems to get better and better the more he plays, and the scary thing is, he's still relatively new to the position.\n\nBill Bender: Los Angeles Rams. Matthew Stafford is playing at a MVP level, and they are good enough to make a run through the NFC. Sean McVay knows how to move the pieces with Kyren Williams and Puka Nacua. Davante Adams should return for the playoff run. The Seahawks were the only team in the NFC that limited Los Angeles to 21 points or less this season.\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Jacksonville Jaguars. Since Week 7, the Jaguars have scored at least 23 points in all 11 games, including seven games with at least 30 points. Head coach Liam Coen has Trevor Lawrence playing at a high level, which included dropping 34 points on the Denver Broncos in Week 16. Many of this year's playoff teams are defense-first teams, but it was Jacksonville's scorching-hot offense that led the Jaguars back to the playoffs.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Los Angeles Rams. Matthew Stafford and Sean McVay get it done with so many skill players behind a strong offensive line. They can dominate with wide receivers or burn you with tight ends. They can also now field a 1-2 punch in the power running game. The Rams have a consistent floor and a high ceiling.\n\nDaniel Mader: The Los Angeles Rams. Matthew Stafford had a career year, which says a lot at age 37. I think the Rams go as far as their young defense takes them, meaning I expect Stafford’s arm to continue thriving in the playoffs. I’m not confident the Seahawks, Eagles or any other team can slow down Puka Nacua and Davante Adams for 60 minutes.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: The Los Angeles Rams are getting healthy and that is going to be a problem for defenses. Even when Los Angeles didn't have Davante Adams through the end of the season, tight end Tyler Higbee was activated off of IR and had 91 yards and a touchdown. Add in Adams to Kyren Williams, Puka Nacua, Tyler Higbee and Colby Parkinson and you've got one of the deeper offenses in the playoffs. Oh, and L.A. happened to score the most points per game (30.1) during the regular season.\n\nDavid Suggs: The Los Angeles Rams. They led the league in scoring and averaged 31.75 points across four matchups with the Seahawks and 49ers. Matthew Stafford was a revelation this year, while Los Angeles boasts perhaps the best pass-catching tandem in the sport in Puka Nacua and Davante Adams. I think the points will keep on flowing in Tinseltown.\n\nEd Williams: Los Angeles Rams. Sean McVay can get conservative at times, but when push comes to shove, give me Matthew Stafford, Puka Nacua, Davante Adams, the Kyren Williams/Blake Corum duo at running back and the playcalling and offensive scheming of the head coach over any other team in the postseason. Josh Allen may be the most dynamic quarterback in the playoffs, but the Rams are the most complete offense. You can get pressure on Matthew Stafford, but he's also capable of getting the ball out quickly and he can throw at weird angles to get around defenders in pursuit. If the defense isn't finishing and bringing him down, the Rams could go all the way.\n\nBill Bender: Houston Texans. Houston hasn't given up more than 21 points in a game since Week 10 – and they allowed an average of 15.4 points per game on the road this season. The Texans allowed 30 points in Week 18 – but we're not worried about that. The tandem of Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson Jr. can wreck a game plan – and that should bring more than enough confidence going into a matchup with the AFC North champions.\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Seattle Seahawks. It's hard to hold the 49ers to three points in San Francisco, but that's exactly what the Seahawks did on Saturday. Under second-year head coach Mike MacDonald, Seattle's defense can match up against any offense, especially when they won't have to leave Seattle for the rest of the NFC playoffs. Combine incredible talent with a high-level defensive play-caller, and you get the most trustworthy defense in the league.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Seattle Seahawks. They have become super stingy against the pass with pressure and coverage clicking and they always have been tough to run against. In a season of big-time scoring, they held opponents to an average of 17.2 points per game.\n\nDaniel Mader: The Seattle Seahawks. Mike Macdonald looks like a home-run hire for Seattle, with a terrific blend of versatility, dominant pass rushing and overall disruptiveness on his defensive unit. The Seahawks are like an inverse Rams to me: I expect their defense to win games, but the bigger question is whether Sam Darnold is ready to take a leap toward playoff success.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: The Seattle Seahawks earned the No. 1 seed in the NFC partly due to having the league's leading wide receiver, but also boasting one of the best defenses in the NFL. This feels the closest the Seahawks have been to re-capturing the Legion of Boom dominance as the unit finds itself in the top-10 for several defensive metrics. Seattle's defense ranks 2nd in points against per game, fifth in first downs allowed, sixth in total yards allowed. The Seahawks have given up the 12th-fewest passing yards and third-fewest rushing yards per game.\n\nDavid Suggs: The Houston Texans. Houston's defense has it all; tough tacklers are littered across the front seven, while the secondary is awash with starlight. DeMeco Ryans' side conceded just 14 to the Rams, 15 to the 49ers, 17 to the Jaguars and 19 to the Bills. I'm expecting them to offer similar displays during postseason play.\n\nEd Williams: Philadelphia Eagles. There have been a couple blips on the radar along the way, but the Eagles' defense has really carried the team in 2025. While the offense has gone through highly-publicized struggles this season, one of the youngest defenses in the league has outperformed expectations. Quinyon Mitchell followed up his impressive rookie campaign by being the only cornerback in the league to be targeted 60+ times and not allow a TD (82 targets). He also allowed the lowest completion percentage among all cornerbacks. Cooper DeJean is already one of, if not the best nickel cornerbacks in the league, and the linebacker tandem of Zach Baun and Nakobe Dean might be the best in the league. The defensive front is stacked with Jalen Carter finally looking healthier after shoulder issues, Jordan Davis enjoying a career year, Nolan Smith rounding into form, Jalyx Hunt continuing to ascend and free agent acquisition Jaelan Phillips paying immediate dividends. But the X-factor is Vic Fangio who always seems to have an answer at the most important times. This defense can give up yards and production, but while they may bend, they don't typically break and tighten things up in the red zone.\n\nBill Bender: Buffalo Bills. Too much belief? Buffalo was 3-3 against teams that are in the postseason this year, but it's time for the breakthrough. James Cook will keep the running game going. Buffalo has just one turnover in its last four games. Can they go through Jacksonville, New England and Denver to get back to the Super Bowl for the first time since 1993?\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Houston Texans. The Texans have never made it to the AFC Championship game, but that ends this year on their trip to the Super Bowl. Houston has a defense that can travel on the road and win anywhere, which will help carry the Texans to cold-weather cities in the dead of winter. Plus, DeMeco Ryans is already one of the best young coaches in the NFL, and he will show why with a deep playoff run.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Jacksonville Jaguars. Their profile has fewer weaknesses by the passing week. Trevor Lawrence fills the elite AFC QB void left by no Patrick Mahomes and they suddenly look loaded there, playing off Travis Etienne and the running game. Their defense is also opportunistic in forcing takeaways in crucial game-changing moments.\n\nDaniel Mader: The Buffalo Bills. Part of my reasoning is that I simply can’t yet trust the crop of Bo Nix, Drake Maye, Trevor Lawrence or Justin Herbert until one of those quarterbacks breaks through and proves they can lead a team to multiple playoff wins. Until then, I won’t bet against Josh Allen, the most proven and dynamic quarterback in the playoffs. Down the stretch of close games, he’s who I think can lead a team through the bracket.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: The turnaround in one year has been impressive for the New England Patriots. The Patriots have a great quarterback and a pair of running backs that can help consistently get the offense down the field. As long as Stefon Diggs' off-the-field issues don't prevent him from playing in the playoffs, New England is in a prime position to get back to the Super Bowl, and will match up well no matter who the Patriots play in the postseason.\n\nDavid Suggs: The Jacksonville Jaguars. Call this one wishful thinking. But the Jaguars have been on a tear as of late, vanquishing eight straight sides to climb to the upper echelons of the AFC. Trevor Lawrence has looked every bit like the highly-touted talent he was suggested to be while in college. Jacksonville shone in wins over the Texans, 49ers, Chargers and Broncos. Liam Coen's bunch will keep the good times rolling in the playoffs.\n\nEd Williams: Buffalo Bills. Both the AFC and NFC are really wide open this year. The Bills are a 6-seed, so they'll likely have to be on the road the entire postseason, but Josh Allen is the best quarterback in the postseason. Drake Maye has put together an MVP-caliber campaign in just his second year, but they also have had a relatively easy schedule. This will be his first taste of the postseason, while Allen is no stranger to the perils of postseason play. If the Bills are able to get by Jacksonville in the first round, barring a Chargers upset of the Patriots, they'll get the Broncos in the divisional round. While the Broncos have a great defense, the two teams also met in the playoffs last year, and the Bills emerged with a convincing 31-7 victory. While it would likely be much closer this time around, I'll take Josh Allen over Bo Nix any day of the week.\n\nBill Bender: Los Angeles Rams. This is a tough pick because we believe they will have to go through the Seahawks to get there. Seattle is a real threat, and Sam Darnold has been on point all season. We think those teams will see each other in either the divisional round or the NFC championship game – and a rematch of the 38-37 thriller in Week 16 is in order. The Rams had 581 yards in that game.\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Seattle Seahawks. Getting home-field advantage was crucial for the Seahawks, as there is no tougher place to play in January than Seattle. With the NFC full of fierce opponents, the bye will help the Seahawks get healthy and prepare while their opponents battle on wild-card weekend. As long as Sam Darnold can protect the football, which he has done for most of the season, Seattle should be favored to make it out of the NFC.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Seattle Seahawks. This is an odd feeling that they are back in a position to win a Super Bowl far removed from Russell Wilson and Pete Carroll days. Mike Macdonald has created a dominant defense that can win a championship with Sam Darnold just needing to protect the ball as a complementary QB.\n\nDaniel Mader: The Los Angeles Rams. Playing in a loaded NFC West was tough for L.A. after a strong start to the season, but I still think this is the most talented offense in football with a young defense that has stepped up plenty of times before. If the Rams can avoid their previous special teams issues, their path to the Super Bowl is there: beat an 8-9 Panthers team, take down a familiar Seahawks squad in the divisional round, then overcome the Eagles, 49ers, Packers or Bears, all of whom have their flaws, in the NFC Championship Game.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: I think the Los Angeles Rams beat the Carolina Panthers, but then benefit from the San Francisco 49ers beating the Philadelphia Eagles. This would allow Los Angeles to face the Chicago Bears before either the Seattle Seahawks or the Niners in the NFC Championship game. I think the Rams have the deepest offense and the second-best defense in the NFC playoff picture which should help them to win the NFC.\n\nDavid Suggs:The Los Angeles Rams. Losses to the Seahawks and Falcons scuppered what looked to be a push for the NFC's No. 1 seed in Los Angeles. But Stafford has been the league's best hurler and has a championship pedigree. Sean McVay will have the Rams ready for the winter, just as they were in 2019 and 2022. Los Angeles fell just short of the NFC Championship last year. It will do one better in 2025, beating all comers to punch its ticket for the Super Bowl.\n\nEd Williams: Philadelphia Eagles. While it hasn't been pretty at times, Philadelphia managed to avoid a true Super Bowl hangover and are not only back in the postseason, but broke the NFC East curse and won the division for the second straight year — the first time that feat has been accomplished since the Eagles won four straight division titles from 2001-2004. The defense has carried the team at times, but the talent on the offensive side of the ball cannot be discounted. Even though they've struggled with consistency, Jalen Hurts, A.J. Brown, DeVonta Adams, Saquon Barkley and company are capable of beating any defense if they are all on the same page. Jalen Hurts has proven he doesn't shrink in the spotlight, and that experience can help carry them through some tough matchups along the way. The two seeds above them in the Seattle Seahawks and Chicago Bears do not boast much postseason experience, so it's not out of the question that Eagles can gain more home-field advantage along the way, and The Linc is a difficult place to play, especially in the colder months.\n\nBill Bender: Buffalo Bills beat Los Angeles Rams. Two wild-card teams? It's a risky pick, but this is a wide-open playoff. Defense matters, and the Rams had some late-season concerns. It's not just about Josh Allen and Matthew Stafford, but in the playoffs, the QBs take center stage. Would Stafford win a second Super Bowl? Or will Buffalo finally win a Super Bowl? Allen finally gets it done.\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Houston Texans over Seattle Seahawks. It's been a weird year in the NFL, so it's only fitting that the Super Bowl champion is an unexpected victor. DeMeco Ryan and the Texans are on a nine-game winning streak entering the playoffs, and thanks to a strong defense and timely offense, will ride the winning streak four more games to a Super Bowl title in a low-scoring battle against Seattle.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Jacksonville Jaguars over Seattle Seahawks. In the ultimate season of surprise, let's go for a team that has never been to a Super Bowl to win a Super Bowl on its first try. Lawrence gives the Jaguars a QB equalizer or edge over most teams and the Jaguars match up well with the Seahawks as they excel at forcing takeaways and the Seahawks often have trouble with giveaways.\n\nDaniel Mader: The Los Angeles Rams. There are plenty of reasons to doubt L.A., as there are for every team in the bracket this season, but between the Rams’ head coach, terrific quarterback play, talented wide receiver duo and group of defensive playmakers, I still think they have another gear to reach. Give me the Rams’ second Super Bowl win in five years.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: It hurts taking the New England Patriots to win another Super Bowl after we had to deal with their recent dynasty, but no matter the matchup they face this postseason, they should be favored or at the very least match up well. If they had a more prolific WR2 in the offense, it feels like New England would be everyone's favorite. I think the Patriots and Rams play each other in the Super Bowl, and New England is able to do just enough to win another ring.\n\nDavid Suggs:The Los Angeles Rams. I just think they've got a really balanced side that is capable of causing opposition sides problems in a number of ways. McVay, Stafford and Los Angeles beat the Jaguars to hoist their second Lombardi Trophy since returning to Hollywood.\n\nEd Williams: Philadelphia Eagles. The Eagles just outlasted the Bills a couple of weeks ago in Week 17 of the regular season, but that could have been just a preview of what we might see in the Super Bowl. While Levi's Stadium is not a dome, it's also not likely they'll have to deal with monsoon freezing rain conditions like the two squads just dealt with in Buffalo. The offenses should be able to put more points on the board, but it's the Eagles defense that will come up big in limiting Josh Allen, and Jalen Hurts will silence his critics once again with another Super Bowl MVP award.",

    "description": "The biggest question in football was asked last night to Travis Kelce, and he had an answer.",
    "fullText": "After Travis Kelce exited the field solemnly on Sunday night in Las Vegas after the Kansas City Chiefs fell for the final time this NFL season, there was one question on every fan, pundit, and probably even player’s mind:\n\nWas that the last game Travis Kelce ever played?\n\nOn Monday, we have somewhat of an answer, albeit one many fans might not have wanted to hear.\n\nFollowing the team’s game, Kelce shuffled into the locker room and was faced with questions from the media about his future plans with the Chiefs and if he had already decided on his future.\n\nKelce admitted that after the Chiefs' Super Bowl loss last year, he instantly knew he would be back with the Chiefs the next season. He wasn’t going to let his career end that way, and he was motivated that night to return to play with the only franchise he’s ever known.\n\nAfter the Raiders' loss, however, he was much more split. He explained that he doesn’t know at the moment when he will decide what he will do for the rest of the year regarding football.\n\nOne of the most successful players on and off the field, Kelce is scheduled to marry his partner, world pop star Taylor Swift, this coming June in Rhode Island.\n\nHe also hosts one of the most popular podcasts in North America, “New Heights” with his brother, retired NFL lineman and fellow Super Bowl champion Jason Kelce.\n\nEven Travis’ mother, Donna, is set to make her big television debut in only a few days on “The Traitors,” a competitive reality show produced by NBC on Peacock.\n\nWe will keep you updated on Kelce’s decision on whether he will play his 14th season in the NFL or if Sunday was his last dance.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Did Travis Kelce Retire From NFL, Chiefs After Week 18 Loss?",

    "description": "The alternative to paying a premium price for a high-end quarterback isn’t pretty.",
    "fullText": "The NFL playoff field is set, and it's missing half of the league's top 10 highest-paid quarterbacks in average annual value.\n\nSpotrac made note of that fact on Monday, a day after the dust settled on the NFL's regular season. Of the league's top 10 paid quarterbacks, Josh Allen, Trevor Lawrence, Jordan Love, Brock Purdy and Justin Herbert are all in the postseason.\n\nDak Prescott, Joe Burrow, Tua Tagovailoa, Jared Goff and Lamar Jackson are not.\n\nHalf of the Top 10 Average Paid QBs made the playoffs - half didn't.\n\nDak Prescott ❌\nJosh Allen ✅\nJoe Burrow ❌\nTrevor Lawrence ✅\nJordan Love ✅\nTua Tagovailoa ❌\nJared Goff ❌\nBrock Purdy ✅\nJustin Herbert ✅\nLamar Jackson ❌\n\n— Spotrac (@spotrac) January 5, 2026\n\nWhich got us to thinking. Are teams hamstringing their playoff chances in a salary-capped league by paying premiums for quarterbacks? Is it too difficult in the modern NFL to build a competitive roster around a quarterback playing on a premium salary?\n\nQuarterback is the most important position in football, if not in all of sports. It's difficult to win a Super Bowl without a high-end signal caller, though Super Bowls have been won with Nick Foles, Jeff Hostetler, Jim Plunkett, Brad Johnson and Trent Dilfer.\n\nBut having a Patrick Mahomes, Tom Brady, Peyton Manning or Joe Montana is historically the best ingredient for success. And they cost money.\n\nHere's a look at the salaries of starting quarterbacks for all 32 NFL teams, grouped by whether or not they made the playoffs. Players with a top-10 salary are in bold.\n\nCaleb Williams: $9.9 million (rookie contract)\n\nBryce Young: $9.5 million (rookie contract)\n\nDrake Maye: $9.2 million (rookie contract)\n\nC.J. Stroud: $9.1 million (rookie contract)\n\nBo Nix: $4.7 million (rookie contract)\n\nDak Prescott, Cowboys: $60 million\n\nJoe Burrow, Bengals: $55 million\n\nTua Tagovailoa, Dolphins: $53.1 million\n\nLamar Jackson, Ravens: $52 million\n\nKyler Murray, Cardinals: $46.1 million\n\nKirk Cousins, Falcons: $45 million\n\nPatrick Mahomes, Chiefs: $45 million\n\nGeno Smith, Raiders: $37.5 million\n\nBaker Mayfield, Buccaneers: $33.3 million\n\nJustin Fields, Jets: $20 million\n\nDaniel Jones, Colts: $14 million\n\nCam Ward, Titans: $12.2 million (rookie contract)\n\nJayden Daniels, Commanders: $9.4 million (rookie contract)\n\nJ.J. McCarthy, Vikings: $5.5 million (rookie contract)\n\nJaxson Dart, Giants: $4.2 million (rookie contract)\n\nTyler Shough, Saints: $2.7 million (rookie contract)\n\nShedeur Sanders, Browns: $1.2 million (rookie contract)\n\nIt's notable that five of the 12 playoff quarterbacks are playing on rookie contracts, which are capped by the collective bargaining agreement.\n\nThat cost control is extremely valuable, and optimizing roster construction around rookie quarterback contracts is a proven formula for success. Since the inception of the rookie wage scale in 2011, the Seattle Seahawks with Russell Wilson (2014 season) and the Kansas City Chiefs with Mahomes (2019 season) have navigated the rookie wage scale to Super Bowl victories.\n\nThis, season, the Patriots have an MVP candidate in Maye who's the ninth-highest paid player on the team. Nix playing on a $4.7 million salary has allowed the Broncos to build a Super Bowl contender despite Wilson's disastrous contract remaining on the books.\n\nStroud, meanwhile is a veteran quarterback in his third season who's surrounded by one of the NFL's fiercest defenses. It would not be a surprise to see any of them playing in or winning the Super Bowl in January.\n\nThis is an optimal way to build a Super contender in the short window available to pay quarterbacks on a rookie contract. This, of course, requires hitting successfully on a quarterback in the draft who can lead a team to contention at a young age.\n\nAnd it's also, obviously, not the only path to success. Thirteen of the 15 Super Bowls won since the inception of the rookie wage scale have been won by quarterbacks not playing on a rookie deal.\n\nAt some point, those rookie quarterbacks will be due for extensions. And if you've got a high-end quarterback on your hands who's due to be paid, there's little choice but to pay him. And that doesn't mean that you can't build a successful roster around said quarterback.\n\nYes, half of the top 10 paid quarterbacks will be watching the playoffs from home. But it's a little absurd to suggest that that's an indictment of paying top quarterbacks their market value.\n\nBurrow missed most of the season due to injury. Do the Bengals have also roster construction issues? Absolutely. But that's an issue that's plagued the franchise for pretty much the entirety of its existence under Brown family ownership, with or without a premium quarterback on the roster.\n\nThe Cowboys likewise have roster concerns that limited their upside. Like with the Bengals, it's fairer to take a look at the decades-long management under Jerry Jones (and the defense specifically this year) than point to the $60 million salary of Prescott, who was excellent this season, to explain why the Cowboys aren't in the playoffs.\n\nIt's difficult to argue that the Lions and Ravens didn't build strong rosters around Goff and Jackson. There's talent on both sides of the ball on both teams outside of their quarterbacks. And Jackson was clearly limited by injuries this season, while the Lions were ravaged by injuries of their own.\n\nIn the end, 14 of the league's 32 teams make the playoffs. The Ravens and Lions just missed out, but it wouldn't be a surprise for either or both to return to contention next season.\n\nAnd then there's Tagovailoa. His contract at this point was pretty clearly a mistake. He got benched at the end of the season, and his time in Miami very well may be done. The Dolphins would surely take a do-over on his deal of they could.\n\nBut the Prescott, Jackson, Burrow and Goff deals? There are surely no regrets from their respective franchises. Teams without high-end quarterbacks would certainly jump at the chance to take their contracts on.",

I cannot express properly in words how good we have been treated.\"\n\nThe Browns confirmed Andrew Berry, who was hired in 2020 alongside Stefanski, will remain as general manager.\n\nStefanski is the second NFL head coach to be fired following the end of the season after the Atlanta Falcons dismissed Raheem Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot on Sunday night.\n\nThe Falcons went back-to-back seasons with an 8-9 record under Morris, who joined in 2024, and failed to reach the play-offs during Fontenot's five-year stint.",

    "fullText": "Ranking 6 best Raiders coaching candidates to replace Pete Carroll, from Klint Kubiak to Chris Shula originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAccording to several reports, the return of Pete Carroll as an NFL head coach will last only one season. The former Seahawks Super Bowl winner flamed out with the Raiders in 2025 in a short but tumultuous tenure at age 74.\n\nCarroll's defense disappointed with Patrick Graham calling plays. The offense was a dysfunctional mess with coordinator Chip Kelly being fired during the season.\n\nKeeping in mind that Tom Brady is part owner and the team is well-positioned to take a franchise QB high in the 2026 NFL Draft, here's looking at the top potential replacements for Carroll.\n\nNFL MOCK DRAFT 2026:Raiders land Indiana's Fernando Mendoza at No. 1\n\nKlint Kubiak would be considered for his great pocket passing work with Sam Darnold in a balanced and explosive Seattle offense. He would be a great immediate personality and schematic influence on a rookie QB such as Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza or Oregon's Dante Moore.\n\nKliff Kingsbury is a good friend of Tom Brady's, having spent some time as a fellow Patriots QB. Kingsbury was huge in leading to a big rookie season for Jayden Daniels to help a quick turnaround in Washington in 2024. He also can provide that impact for Mendoza or Moore, as he was once attached to the Cardinals in 2019 when they were set to take Kyler Murray at No. 1 overall.\n\nMike LaFleur would be the top choice for Tom Brady and the ownership straight from the Sean McVay tree. He's overdue to get a job as the rising star younger brother of Packers coach Matt.\n\nVance Joseph would be a good defensive path to consider as he's become a stronger second-chance coaching candidate working under Sean Payton in Denver. He would help clean up things defensively and add some good experience.\n\nTom Brady can go after the former DC from his alma mater, Michigan, straight from fellow former Wolverines QB Jim Harbaugh. Jesse Minter is a rising star with his play-calling for the rival Chargers.\n\nTom Brady is a historian of the game and should also notice the strong influence and play-calling Chris Shula, the son of late Hall of Fame coaching legend Don, has done working on the other side of the ball from Mike LaFleur for McVay. Shula can provided needed youthful energy and motivation that was lost from Carroll.",

If the Ravens beat the Steelers on Sunday Night Football, they will host Houston in the Wild Card round.\n\nThe NFL closes out the 2025-26 regular season schedule with the Pittsburgh Steelers hosting the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday Night Football. The game kicks off at 8:20 p.m. ET with the AFC North title on the line. The Ravens are a 3.5-point road favorite heading into the matchup.\n\nThe big news for this matchup is that Baltimore will have Lamar Jackson back at QB. He missed last week’s game against the Packers due to a back injury. He’s been banged up for much of this season but is still a proven upgrade over Tyler Huntley. The Ravens would have been an underdog in this matchup if Jackson couldn’t go.\n\nThe Ravens have to win to secure the AFC North and the accompanying playoff berth. They are 8-8 and win would improve them to 9-8. The Steelers are 9-7 and a loss would drop them to 9-8. A Ravens win would even the season series but give Baltimore the division record tiebreaker.\n\nThe winner of the game will secure the No. 4 seed in the playoffs. They will play one of the Texans, Chargers, or Bills depending on how Sunday’s results shake out.\n\nHere are the current AFC standings after the Christmas games:\n\nNew England Patriots (13-3) – xy\n\nJacksonville Jaguars (12-4) – x\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (11-5) – x\n\nx – Team has clinched a playoff spot\ny – Team has clinched division title\nz – Team has clinched No. 1 seed\ne – Team has been eliminated from playoff contention\n\nHere are the AFC North standings as Week 17 begins:",

Obviously that is much easier said than done.\n\nThis upcoming offseason is one of the most important and critical in recent Cowboys history as they have multiple first-round draft picks for the first time since 2008. With the Cowboys now officially done for the season, we know where they will be picking come the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nHere are the first 12 picks of the draft, through the Cowboys selection at number 12 overall, courtesy of Tankathon.\n\nIf all of this sounds familiar it is because it is… the Cowboys held the 12th overall pick last year and used it to select Tyler Booker. They also used it in 2021 to select Micah Parsons, more on him in a moment, although they picked it up after trading back two spots. For what it’s worth the Detroit Lions held the pick in consecutive seasons beginning the year after and landed Jameson Williams and Jahmyr Gibbs, so hopefully that type of success is what the Cowboys find.\n\nWhile we know where the Cowboys are picking, it is still unknown exactly where their other first-round pick will land. Dallas holds Green Bay’s selection in the 2026 NFL Draft and the Packers are currently set to visit the Chicago Bears in the Wild Card Round which means we are all rooting for Chicago to take care of business.\n\nKeep in mind that Dallas has also already dealt away 2026 draft capital as well.\n\n2nd: Dealt away in Quinnen Williams trade\n\n3rd: Dealt away in George Pickens trade\n\n6th: Dealt away in Jordan Phillips trade with New York Giants in early 2024, also received a 7th that was sent to the Cincinnati Bengals in exchange for Logan Wilson\n\n7th (Kansas City’s): Acquired from the Chiefs when Dallas sent them Peyton Hendershot in early 2024\n\n7th (their own): Dealt away when Dallas traded for Kaiir Elam in early 2025\n\nThe Cowboys are projected to receive a couple of compensatory picks as well, potentially in the fifth-round, but those are not fully known at this time.",

    "description": "Sam Darnold stood up to the old narratives about himself and proved to be a winner this NFL season. Now come the playoffs, and a chance to be great",
    "fullText": "The NFC now runs through the Seattle Seahawks, and a former USC Trojan quarterback led his team to an NFC West title and a first-round bye in the playoffs. Sam Darnold faced the same scenario last season as his Minnesota Vikings took on the Detroit Lions with the same stakes. Just like many other big games Sam Darnold has played in, he came up short last year, and he was a big reason for the loss versus the Lions. This time around, that was not the case.\n\nAs the starter for the Vikings, Sam Darnold in Week 18 last year had a statline of 18/41 for 166 yards through the air and no touchdowns or interceptions. Darnold was sacked two times, and the Detroit Lions made Darnold, who was an MVP candidate that season, look like a rookie. Against the 49ers Saturday night, Darnold still did not look like an MVP, but he did not have to. All that was asked of him was to take care of the football and play better than Brock Purdy. He did just that.\n\nDarnold was not the reason the Seahawks lost this game. He was still 20/26 and threw 198 yards passing. Darnold, in the moments he needed to deliver, he did, and it was always to his best target, Jaxon Smith-Njigba. This was not his best game by any means, but Darnold still stepped up and added another big game victory to his resume. He is killing old narratives that he can not win big games, as he proved that with his last two victories against division opponents.\n\nNobody expected this team to run away with this tough division and be in first place in the NFC. The Seahawks did that because they finally have their franchise quarterback and everything else this team needs to win. Darnold did not finish the season as an MVP candidate finalist, even though he was a name drawing consideration early in the season. He still finishes the year with 4,048 yards passing, 25 touchdowns, and a 67.7 completion percentage. Darnold was everything the Seahawks needed him to be this year.\n\nThe Seahawks look every bit like a Super Bowl contender and should be the favorite to come out of the NFC. The Seahawks defense stopped the hottest offense in the NFL to just 3 points, a week after they put up 42 points. The run game for Seattle was unstoppable, as Kenneth Walker ran for 97 yards and Zach Charbonnet ran for 74 yards and a touchdown. Sam Darnold was a game manager, but he has given this team confidence that when he needs to be elite, he can do that.\n\nThe NFC now runs through the 12th man, and no team in the NFC is looking forward to dealing with the Seahawks come playoff time. There are no longer any weaknesses on this team, and the days of betting on Sam Darnold to disappear in a clutch game are now over. If Sam Darnold plays just like he did last night, the Seahawks could very well win the Super Bowl.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: Sam Darnold wins another big game as Seahawks stand atop NFC",

    "fullText": "NFL coaches fired in 2026: Latest news on Mike Tomlin, John Harbaugh, others on Black Monday hot seat originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFourteen NFL teams are looking ahead to the playoffs, but for everyone else, it’s on to the offseason.\n\nBefore free agency and the draft take center stage, the coaching carousel will be the first to heat up. Just don’t expect it to be quite as busy as it was in 2024 or 2025.\n\nWhile the Tennessee Titans and New York Giants both made midseason coaching changes, the combination of back-to-back active cycles over the previous two years and late-season surges from a few teams with coaches on the hot seat could leave this January quieter than normal on the coaching front.\n\nThat doesn’t mean nothing will happen, though. Some coaches’ statuses remained up in the air in Week 18, and it wouldn’t be the NFL offseason without a surprise.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about every coach who might be on the hot seat.\n\nMORE:2025 Fantasy Football Awards\n\nThe Giants fired coach Brian Daboll on Nov. 10, after blowing yet another lead in a loss to the Chicago Bears a day earlier. New York gained momentum after benching Russell Wilson for Jaxson Dart in September, even knocking off the Eagles in a prime-time slot, but the Giants had a penchant for blowing leads this season, including a 19-point meltdown against the Denver Broncos. Daboll went 20-40-1 over less than four seasons in New York.\n\nAfter a dismal 1-5 start with their offense among the worst in the NFL, the Titans fired coach Brian Callahan in the middle of his second season. Tennessee resisted making Callahan a one-and-done coach in 2024, bringing him back after a 3-14 season and giving him the chance to develop No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward, but the Titans showed little improvement over the first six games of the season before Mike McCoy replaced Callahan on an interim basis. Callahan went 4-19 over 23 games in Nashville.\n\nMORE:NFL playoffs QB confidence meter\n\nLas Vegas Raiders coach Pete Carroll is at risk of going one-and-done in Las Vegas, according to multiple reports.“We’ll see if Pete Carroll is there for it. I doubt it, but we’ll see,” NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport said while discussing the Raiders’ outlook for the 2026 draft, reiterating other reports that claim the organization might want to clean house as a disastrous season comes to a close.\n\nHeading into Week 18, signs are pointing to the Pete Caroll era being one-and-done in Las Vegas. Insiders including CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones and NFL Network's Ian Rapoport believe that the Raiders are heading for a reset. Las Vegas welcomes in the defending AFC champions Kansas City Chiefs in Week 18.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter leans towards the Raiders moving on from Caroll after jsut one season. Schefter is calling it a failed \"experiment,\" and believes the Raiders will eat the final two years on his contract.\n\nFox's Jay Glazer also believes that Caroll will be out after one season as the Raiders' head coach.\n\nIf the Raiders make a change, they would be searching for their 13th full-time head coach in the last 25 years.\n\nThe future of Cleveland Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski has been the subject of much speculation, but reports haven't clarified whether he is more likely to stay or go. The two-time Coach of the Year suffered through an ugly 2024 season and likewise didn't come close to contending in 2025, though the Browns entered the year with low expectations and no clear answer at quarterback. Stefanski is hoping a gritty Week 17 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers will be enough to buy him a seventh season in Cleveland.\n\nAccording to CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones, Cleveland and Stefanski appear to be headed for a split. Jones details that \"At 43, Stefanski remains a young coach who is well thought of across the league, and few would be surprised if he winds up getting another head-coaching gig this cycle.\"\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter believes Stefanski will not be back to coach the Browns next season. Schefter also claims that Stefanski will be a highly sought-after coach with all the openings.\n\nMORE: The NFL's highest paid coaches in 2025\n\nAfter a four-win improvement in 2024, the hope was the Arizona Cardinals would make a playoff leap in 2025. Instead, they completely unraveled after a 2-0 start, losing 13 of their next 14 games and suffering five losses by margins of 20 points or more from November onward. While the Cardinals' major change could be moving on from Kyler Murray, which seems like a near certainty, it might be hard for Arizona to justify Gannon returning for a fourth season.\n\nThough, some believe that Gannon will return to Arizona in 2026. NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported that the general sense around Arizona is Gannon will be the head coach next season, \"this time with a QB that he’s involved in selecting along with GM Monti Ossenfort.\" However, owner Michael Bidwell hasn't made a firm decision yet.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter says that the feeling around the league is that Gannon will remain safe for next season. There is a strong belief that the Cardinals are moving on from Kyler Murray, and therefore, the owners want to give Gannon a chance to find his own quarterback.\n\nSteelers coach Mike Tomlin has still never had a losing season in nearly two decades in Pittsburgh, but the 2025 is shaping up to look much like 2024, whether they win the division or not. The Steelers have faded after an early hot start and taken a couple of surprise losses, including their Week 17 defeat at the hands of the Browns when they had a chance to clinch the AFC North. If the Steelers don't win the division, it will mean they finish one game worse than they did in 2024, before adding Aaron Rodgers, DK Metcalf, Jalen Ramsey and more. That doesn't necessarily mean the Steelers would fire Tomlin, but it could open the door for a mutual parting of ways, depending on what Tomlin is thinking.\n\nA report by Albert Breer suggested the Steelers already know who they would turn to if they part ways with Tomlin. Rams DC Chris Shula, grandson of Don Shula, would be the frontrunner for the job.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter reports there is a feeling that Tomlin will be back, at least to finish his contract. Conversations will still be had, but he's leaning towards being safe.\n\nFox's Jay Glazer believes that if Tomlin is not the coach for the Steelers next season, it would be his own doing. He does not think the Steelers would fire Tomlin.\n\nOn the other side of the Steelers-Ravens rivalry is John Harbaugh, who has done battle with Tomlin for 18 years. Even with Lamar Jackson's injuries playing a major role, the Ravens have to be disappointed with how the season has played out. Baltimore entered Week 17 under .500 and on the verge of elimination, though an AFC North title remains in play. After so much success with Jackson healthy in 2023 and 2024, the Ravens' likeliest path is to just try to reshape the roster as best they can for 2026, but Harbaugh's job status could come into question if frustration mounts.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter leans safe with Harbaugh, but thinks there should be more focus on this situation than on Tomlin's.\n\nAfter a 2-7 start to the season, Mike McDaniel and the Miami Dolphins have turned the season around, going 5-2 over the seven games leading into Week 18. That might've help save McDaniel's job, as McDaniel needed a strong finish to prove why he should remain in the role.\n\nThe Dolphins will be looking for a new general manager in the offseason after firing Chris Grier, so it's possible that hire will help decide McDaniel's fate. However, NFL Network reports that McDaniel will likely return for a fifth season.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter is also leaning towards McDaniel being safe for the time being.\n\nAdam Schefter on ESPN:\n\n“The feeling of owners right now is (the Dolphins) prefer to keep (Mike McDaniel). It doesn’t mean that he’s going to be safe. But we are leaning safe today. If they were making a decision today (he) is back. But there will be conversations in the…\n\n— Joe Schad (@schadjoe) January 4, 2026\n\nThe Atlanta Falcons seemed to he headed toward a change after spiraling to 4-9 despite entering the season with realistic playoff hopes. Are three consecutive wins enough to save Raheem Morris' job? On one hand, the Falcons have proven Morris has kept the team focused and playing hard even after being eliminated. On the other hand, the late-season run is a reminder of what could have been in a winnable NFC South and raises questions about why Morris couldn't get results against divisional opponents.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter leans safe, believing Morris saved his job given how the Falcons have finished the season.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers' late-season collapse has led some to wonder whether coach Todd Bowles could be on the hot seat. According to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, he isn't likely to be fired. \"They've won three-straight division titles and still have a possibility of winning their fourth. Does that sound like someone who should be in trouble? I'd say certainly not,\" Rapoport said. If the Buccaneers miss the playoffs, though, it might be hard for the organization to ignore questions about the fourth-year coach's status.\n\nThough, with the Buccaneers extending Bowles in the offseason, CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones reported that it seems unlikely Tampa Bay fires the head coach, who has a 34-33 record entering a must-win Week 18 contest against the Carolina Panthers.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter reports that the Buccaneers do not want to make a coaching change, and the belief is that Bowles is safe.\n\nIt's easy to blame Joe Burrow's injury for the Cincinnati Bengals' failures in 2025, but the team still lost winnable games with and without their star losing to the New York Jets without Burrow and getting shut out by the Ravens with him. Still, reports indicate that isn't likely to cost Zac Taylor his job, and back-to-back blowout wins leading into Week 18 indicate the typically loyal Bengals will stick with their head coach for a seventh season with hopes Burrow can stay healthy in 2026.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter says that quarterback Joe Burrow is a believer in Taylor and that the Bengals are not expected to move on.\n\nMORE: Revisiting Aaron Glenn’s playing career\n\nOne-and-done head coaches have become a bit more common in the NFL over the past decade, so speculation about Aaron Glenn's job status has bubbled up among fans as the New York Jets have limped to the finish line. While New York doesn't have much talent on the field with Garrett Wilson and two quarterbacks injured plus two core defensive pieces traded away, tangible progress has been hard to find for Gang Green. That still isn't expected to cost Glenn his job. Fox Sports' Jay Glazer declared, \"he'll be safe,\" when discussing Glenn's status in Week 17, and owner Woody Johnson, for all his flaws, isn't known to be too volatile with coaches.\n\nNFL Network's Ian Rapoport believes the same when it comes to Glenn, saying \"the Jets are bringing back Aaron Glenn for a second season as head coach. The question is, how significant will changes be to his staff?\"\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter shares this same belief and reports that the Jets are committed to Glenn despite the struggles.\n\nFox's Jay Glazer firmly claims that Glenn is safe for next season.\n\nIt might seem surprising to see an accomplished and respected head coach such as Sean McDermott in the conversation of potential firings. However, despite the regular-season success and a good record in Buffalo, playoff success ultimately threatens McDermott's future.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter labels McDermott as safe, but if Buffalo loses in the playoffs, the belief is that conversations would be had about potentially firing McDermott.\n\nIt's been a drastic turn of events for everyone in Indianapolis. After a successful start this season, the Colts were considered potential Super Bowl contenders. However, this was before losing Daniel Jones to a season-ending injury. Since Jones went down in Week 14, the Colts have not won a game.\n\nWhile ESPN's Adam Schefter says Steichen is leaning toward being safe, he also claims the Colts' owners have not spoken on it.\n\nWhile there are no major rumors of Matt LaFleur getting fired, his job security continues to be questioned weekly. Depending on how the season ends for the Packers, it will provide a clearer picture of LaFleur's future.\n\nFox's Jay Glazer places Lafleur in the \"time will tell\" category and believes it would be crazy for the Packers to move on.",

He appeared in 10 games with the Ravens in 2025 and had been with the AFC North franchise since he was drafted. Cleveland and the Ravens made the playoffs several times, but were never able to make the Super Bowl during his time in Baltimore.\n\nThe 6-foot-6, 350-pound offensive lineman appeared in 64 games during his time with Baltimore, but he primarily played as a backup or on special teams. Cleveland will look for a new NFL home. In Feb. 2025, Cleveland was arrested for driving under the influence.\n\nCleveland's combination of size and NFL experience means that he should find a new NFL suitor.

    "fullText": "Even the New York Jets' very own fans could not have envisioned the NFL history that could take place today against the Buffalo Bills. Whether you're pessimistic or optimistic, it's definitely not the good kind of history either.\n\nThe Jets will play the Bills at 4:25 P.M. today, and if they do not get an interception against Josh Allen, they will have gone through the entire season without getting a pick against an opposing quarterback. Making them the first team in NFL history to do so.\n\nThe projected starters this week do not necessarily have a history of turning the ball over, as the starters against the Bills have accounted for only 11 turnovers across their careers. Interceptions have been a bit of a foreign concept for the New York Jets for several years, but to go an entire season without having an interception is definitely something worth noting.\n\nThis offseason, the Jets will not focus solely on defense. Still, the franchise is aware of the shortcomings in competing in the NFL: being physical, playing fast, and forcing turnovers will be a priority in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: New York Jets are on the brink of history, and not the good kind",

    "fullText": "We have elevated DT Ricky Barber and WR River Cracraft from the practice squad pic.twitter.com/LnFS6NHTYI\n\n— Washington Commanders (@Commanders) January 3, 2026\n\nKingsbury will be a hot name this offseason despite having a down year for the Commanders, but will he actually leave? He’s already been linked to the Tennessee Titans and Las Vegas Raiders job as a fit, but what about going to a division rival? ESPN’s Jordan Raanan said the Giants will cast a wide net in their head coaching search, but Kingsbury might be on the outside looking in.\n\n“Commanders’ offensive coordinator Kingsbury, who also has experience as an NFL head coach with the Cardinals, is considered a bright offensive mind. The question is if he’s the right fit for the New York market.” – Jordan Raanan, ESPN\n\nThe Giants interview list includes Mike McCarthy, Chris Shula, Antonio Pierce and more as they cast a wide net. https://t.co/o2weOafxQt\n\n— Jordan Raanan (@JordanRaanan) January 2, 2026\n\nIt would be a surprise if Kingsbury doesn’t even get an interview with the Giants, given his track record with young quarterbacks, and what he could do with Jaxson Dart. It sounds like they could be interested in Kingsbury, but he’s likely more of a tier two or tier three candidate for the Giants.\n\nThe former TCU standout is getting a look down the stretch with Tunsil out. Coleman looks more accomplished and urgent in everything he does. He is not the finished article by any stretch of the imagination, but his upturn in consistency indicates that all hope is not lost just yet.\n\nThis hasn’t gone unnoticed by Quinn. The coach thinks Coleman has learned a great deal in his second campaign. The athletic upside has always been there, but the lineman has developed a new sense of resilience that is standing him in exceptional stead.\n\n“I think…he has learned a lot here in year two. This is a resilient guy that can do a lot of things based on his athleticism, him learning and going through the hard moments.”Dan Quinn via Commanders.com\n\nColeman will start at left tackle again in Week 18 against the Philadelphia Eagles if he gets the all-clear to participate. He’s listed as questionable with a knee problem, but he practiced in full on Friday. That’s a positive sign, which gives him a fighting chance of finishing his campaign on a high note.\n\nThe Commanders elevated Cracraft from the practice squad to the active roster Saturday ahead of Sunday’s game against the Eagles. Cracraft has been elevated for consecutive weeks, finishing Christmas Day’s loss against the Cowboys with just one snap on the special-teams unit. With Terry McLaurin, Deebo Samuel, Treylon Burks and Chris Moore all healthy and active, Cracraft is likely in line to see the same minimal special-teams snap share in Sunday’s game.\n\n1) What were your big takeaways from the Week 16 matchup between the Commanders and Eagles?\n\nI do think it’s silly how the Commanders took such offense to the Eagles going for two late in the game. Why wait until then to show that kind of fight? Also, laughable to hear Dan Quinn talk tough about how Washington was going to see the Eagles again in two weeks. When it seemed like the Eagles will be resting their starters, which we now know is exactly the case. For Quinn to be afraid of going for it on fourth down (punted on 4th-and-4 from the minus 40-yard line down 11 with 9 minutes to go … and punted on 4th-and-6 from the minus 44-yard line down 11 with just 6:44 to go) and then act all tough in the postgame presser? That’s unserious behavior to me.\n\n2) How far do you think the Eagles will get in the post-season and what do you think will be their biggest secret to success or stumbling block?\n\nI think the Eagles can win the Super Bowl. Vic Fangio’s defense is awesome. Jalen Hurts has played well in the biggest games of his career. There is no juggernaut the Eagles simply can’t beat.\n\nDo you expect the Commanders will try especially hard this week or are they going to pack it in and rest key players with an eye to the 2026 season? How do fans want the team to approach this game?\n\nI don’t know that the Commanders will try especially hard to win, but they will certainly try as hard to win as they did in the last matchup (where the playoffs were already out of reach). Reports are that Dan Quinn still has the locker room, the players are still bought in, and the coaches and players still want to win games. So I’m sure they’ll try their hardest to win, just like last time, but the deck will be stacked against them due to all their injuries.\n\nThe decision to rest or play starters is not just about protecting players or gaining draft position, it’s also about putting together some good tape so the front office can actually evaluate the talent on the team. So many players have been injured or are returning from injury, so many players have been moved to different positions or roles (particularly on defense) due to injuries and due to Dan Quinn taking over the defense a few weeks ago, that it’s probably more important for the front office to get additional tape on these players playing their best in order to evaluate them than it is to get a slightly higher draft spot. What good does a better draft pick do if you can’t even evaluate your biggest team needs effectively? For this reason, as well as for pride and division rivalry, I think most fans will be rooting for the starters to play and the team to play well. In my opinion, the only reason to tank is if you need a top 2 pick for a QB, quality players at other positions can be found later in the draft.\n\nTampa Bay’s 16-14 win over the Panthers keeps it alive, but now the Bucs need the Saints to beat the Falcons to make the postseason.\n\nthe showdown game for first place in the NFC South did not yield a division winner, at least not yet.\n\nSo it went on the opening day of the final weekend of the NFL’s regular season. The Seahawks beat the San Francisco 49ers in Santa Clara, California, to secure the NFC West title and the conference’s No. 1 playoff seed. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the Carolina Panthers but will have to wait until Sunday to see whether that will be enough for them to win the NFC South.\n\nThe playoff field is taking shape and will be fully formed when Sunday’s play is done.\n\nThe Buccaneers helped their postseason cause. But they didn’t punch their playoff ticket, at least not yet.\n\nThe opening game of the final weekend of the NFL’s regular season did not determine as much as it could have. The Buccaneers beat the Panthers, 16-14, in the rain Saturday at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa. But they will have to wait until Sunday to find out whether they will secure their fifth straight NFC South title and the NFC’s No. 4 playoff seed.\n\nThey need the Atlanta Falcons to lose Sunday to the New Orleans Saints. If the Falcons beat the Saints, that would create a three-way tie for the division lead with matching 8-9 records. The Panthers would win the division in that case, based on tiebreakers.\n\n“We did everything we could today,” Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield told ESPN afterward. “Sit back and see what happens tomorrow.”\n\nThe final show@BankofAmerica | #RaiseHail pic.twitter.com/UoGpgmFVLs\n\n— Washington Commanders (@Commanders) January 4, 2026\n\nCommanders edge rusher Von Miller needs one sack Sunday vs. the Eagles to finish the season with nine sacks and collect another $500,000 in incentives. pic.twitter.com/eDSPxZ9Lls\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 4, 2026\n\nCommanders WR Deebo Samuel has $650,000 on the line Sunday vs. the Eagles.

    "fullText": "\"Sunday Night Football\" brought us one of the games of the year in Week 17.\n\nThe host San Francisco 49ers and Chicago Bears traded blows throughout all four quarters in a dazzling offensive display. It's the third week in a row in which the final game of the Sunday slate was a one-score affair; the 49ers' 42-38 win is the latest following the Patriots' 28-24 win in Week 16 over the Ravens and the Vikings' 34-26 win over the Cowboys.\n\nTeams have put on a show all season in prime time for a national audience. All 32 teams will be in action this weekend, the final week of the regular season; every contest is a division matchup.\n\nWill that slate include one more prime time matchup to cap off Sunday's action? Here's what to know.\n\nYes, there is a \"Sunday Night Football\" game in Week 18. It's a high-stakes divisional matchup to boot: the Baltimore Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers face off to decide who wins the AFC North.\n\nPittsburgh could've made things tougher for the Ravens by winning in Week 17 over last-placed Cleveland. Instead, the Steelers' offense stumbled, and the Browns won 13-6. That result and the Ravens' win over the Packers a day earlier set up a winner-takes-all Week 18 matchup.\n\nWhichever team wins on \"Sunday Night Football\" will win the AFC North title and earn the No. 4 seed in the AFC playoffs.\n\nHere's a look back at the full slate of Sunday night games this year.

    "description": "Will the Falcons keep head coach Raheem Morris and GM Terry Fontenot? NFL insiders weigh in",
    "fullText": "The Atlanta Falcons were supposed to turn the corner with head coach Raheem Morris at the helm, but it's been nearly two full seasons and they have yet to take that next step. Morris is 15-18 overall entering Sunday's season finale against the New Orleans Saints.\n\nAfter winning three straight games, though, Morris' seat seems to have cooled down considerably. While the team has already been eliminated from playoff contention, the Falcons' recent winning streak has shaken up the NFC South division race.\n\nIf Atlanta wins on Sunday, the Carolina Panthers will NFC South champs. If the Falcons lose, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers will clinch their fifth straight division title. But will a late-season winning streak be enough for Morris to save his job?\n\nAs we approach another Black Monday, NFL insiders have been gathering intel on each coaching situation. Let's see what those around the league are hearing about Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot.\n\nAccording to Dianna Russini of The Athletic, Falcons owner Arthur Blank is expected to bring in a consulting firm to evaluate everything. Russini even suggested that the team may keep Morris and move on from Fontenot in the offseason.\n\nThat work is expected to be weighed alongside the organization’s internal evaluations: two seasons (and a 15-18 record) under coach Raheem Morris, five seasons under Fontenot, how this year has unfolded, the perceived state of the roster and the franchise’s overall team-building approach. Many around the league expect the Falcons to move on from Fontenot and stick with Morris as coach. One potential added voice to the mix? Former quarterback Matt Ryan, who is in talks to return to the organization in a front-office role. -- Dianna Russini, The Athletic\n\nESPN's Jeremy Fowler also put out a feature discussing NFL coaches on the hot seat. Fowler said the Falcons haven't given up on Morris, but Arthur Blank clearly wanted to see more from the team over the last two years.\n\nThe Falcons have not quit on Morris, who has railed off three consecutive wins to make his case for a third year in Atlanta. But that doesn't ensure his return. Morris would most likely need to make staff changes if he does stay. Special teams has been a bugaboo, and quarterback Michael Penix Jr.'s development hasn't proceeded as hoped. -- Jeremy Fowler, ESPN\n\nOver at NFL.com, Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero released a new hot-seat breakdown. The Falcons have been a disappointment, but it sounds like Morris may have bought himself some goodwill with that upset win over the Rams.\n\nAnd for as disappointing as the Falcons were even a month ago, they’ve found a spark down the stretch, playing hard for head coach Raheem Morris and winning three games in a row with formerly demoted veteran Kirk Cousins at quarterback. The reason owners wait to see the entire product is to learn how a team responds to adversity. And with all eyes on them, Atlanta beat the Los Angeles Rams on national TV on Monday night. It gives Blank a lot to think about as he weighs the futures of Morris, who has three years left on his contract, and GM Terry Fontenot, who has one. -- Ian Rapoport & Tom Pelissero, NFL.com\n\nThe Falcons will close out the season against the Saints at 1 p.m. on Sunday afternoon. Once the team makes a decision on Morris and Fontenot, it will be on to free agency for Atlanta. Some key players, including tight end Kyle Pitts and linebacker Kaden Elliss, will be free agents.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Falcons Wire: Atlanta Falcons: NFL insiders on Raheem Morris' job status",

It is a merciful close to a merciless season, one in which splendor and delight turns to wickedness as losses pile up. Their titles lose their luster upon the conclusion of the year, while they prepare for hibernation during a brisk winter and spring.\n\nEven in the dark, though, there is light. Because the league's worst sides are rewarded with a rather remarkable platform — draft picks.\n\nWhile those atop the NFL standings are jostling for postseason seeding, a similarly contentious battle is taking place in the cellar. The Raiders, Giants, Jets, Titans and Cardinals all sit at the bottom of the league standings, meaning they'll land a crown jewel of sorts in terms of draft position.\n\nWhile that's not a guaranteed indicator of success, it can prove consequential. Sides like the Patriots, Seahawks and Broncos all built through the draft, crafting Super Bowl-caliber rosters one pick at a time.\n\nSo, just what does the NFL Draft order look like after Week 18?

They're not the only players tabbed for success at the big-league level, however.\n\nThere are a handful of defenders whose names have sparkled on scouting reports across the league, led by Miami EDGE Rueben Bain Jr., Texas Tech EDGE David Bailey and Ohio State stars Arvell Reese and Caleb Downs.\n\nFurther down the board, there are a few skill players garnering interest. Carnell Tate is making waves despite struggling with injuries in his junior year, while Notre Dame's Jeremiyah Love and Arizona State's Jordyn Tyson have been tipped for brilliance at the big-league level. Suffice to say, there should be plenty of talent on display when Roger Goodell steps to the stage in Pittsburgh come April.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers have ruled the NFC South for several years now.\n\nThe New Orleans Saints won the division in 2020, but the Bucs have won it in each season since then. The team looked to be coasting toward another title in 2025 after a 5-1 start to the season.\n\nHowever, since that point, the team has gone just 3-8. As a result of that horrendous run, Bucs fans are getting antsy.\n\nLuckily, the Bucs ended their regular season with a win over the Carolina Panthers on Saturday. If the Panthers would have won, they would've clinched the NFC South and knocked the Bucs out of postseason contention.\n\nEven though the Bucs won, though, they still need some help. The New Orleans Saints have to beat the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday for the Bucs to clinch the division. If the Falcons win, the Bucs, Panthers, and Falcons will all finish with 8-9 records and the Panthers get the crown.\n\nIf the Falcons win and the Bucs miss the playoffs, are head coach Todd Bowles and general manager Jason Licht in trouble? One NFL insider provided an update on that front Saturday.\n\nAccording to Russini, the Bucs historically prefer to wait until the end of the season before making personnel decisions. It would definitely be disappointing to miss the playoffs, but Russini doesn't think either man is in danger.\n\n“Coach Todd Bowles and general manager Jason Licht, who both signed multiyear extensions in June, have won division titles each of the last three seasons and appear to be safe even if the Bucs miss the playoffs,\" Russini explained.\n\nBowles took over as the head coach of the Bucs ahead of the 2022 season. The Bucs have made the playoffs in each of his seasons so far, and the coach has a 34-33 overall record.\n\nBowles didn't inherit the best situation either, as the roster dealt with a ton of turnover after Tom Brady's retirement. Still, the team has won the NFC South in each of Bowles' seasons.\n\nThe Bucs will undoubtedly be glued to the TV on Sunday to see if they are going to be playing in the postseason again. Regardless, it seems like the head coach and general manager will be around for at least one more season.\n\nDolphins predicted to cut star wide receiver in 2026\n\nCardinals predicted to replace Kyler Murray with 2026 rookie\n\nGiants predicted to add elite weapon for Jaxson Dart\n\nRussell Wilson posts cryptic message among bad season\n\nSteelers predicted to replace Aaron Rodgers with college star\n\nPete Carroll predicted to be one-and-done with Raiders",

In that case, they’ll play either the Eagles or the Bears to kick off the postseason, and I think it goes without saying that the 5-seed is the better option here.\n\nHere are the updated standings before Saturday’s games kick off in Week 18.\n\n1.

    "fullText": "Baker Mayfield and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers held off Carolina 16-14 on Saturday to keep their playoff hopes alive to the bitter end of the NFL season.\n\nThe victory prevented the Panthers from locking up the NFC's last post-season berth and leaves both teams anxiously watching Sunday's results to learn which one progresses.\n\nTampa Bay edged an error-strewn, rain-soaked clash, taking an early lead and relying on cautious tactics and multiple field goals to cling on.\n\n\"We just found a way to win right there -- tough divisional opponent, and we did everything we could today,\" said Bucs' quarterback Mayfield.\n\n\"Sit back and see what happens tomorrow,\" said Mayfield, who threw for a touchdown, completing 16-of-22 attempted passes for 203 yards.\n\nDespite both teams ending the regular season with an 8-9 losing record, one of them is still guaranteed to win the historically weak NFC South division and reach the playoffs.\n\nWhether the Bucs or the Panthers advance now depends on the outcome of a clash between two teams with no hope of reaching the playoffs -- the Atlanta Falcons and the New Orleans Saints.\n\nTampa Bay, who have won the NFC South for the past four years and started this season well before imploding, will be rooting for the bottom-placed but in-form Saints.\n\nMeanwhile, Carolina must rely on inconsistent Atlanta. If the Falcons win, a three-way tie atop the NFC South at 8-9 would see the Panthers edge through on head-to-head results.\n\nTampa Bay scored on the game's opening drive, as tight end Cade Otton belatedly caught his first touchdown of the season, and the Bucs soon added a field goal.\n\nBut following an intercepted Baker Mayfield pass, a wide-open Tommy Tremble grabbed a Panthers touchdown with a clever, mazy run.\n\nWith torrential downpours hampering both sides, another interception -- this time off Carolina's Bryce Young -- set up another Bucs field goal for a 13-7 half-time lead.\n\nRain eased in the second half, but not before kicker Ryan Fitzgerald slipped to miss a 54-yard Panthers field goal attempt.\n\nNerves grew among the home crowd as Tampa Bay adopted ultra-cautious tactics to protect a slender lead.\n\nBut favorable decisions by officials -- a missed penalty, plus two pass interference calls -- helped Tampa Bay reach a 16-7 lead in the fourth quarter.\n\nAfter yet another rain-soaked Panthers fumble, and a blocked Tampa Bay field goal attempt, Jalen Coker caught an eight-yard touchdown with just over two minutes remaining to bring Carolina hope.\n\nBut the Buccaneers held on. A grinning Mayfield said he will now learn if his season will continue into the playoffs \"from my own couch.\"",

    "description": "Tampa Bay's 16-14 defeat of the Carolina Panthers means the NFC South title will be decided on the NFL regular season's final day.",
    "fullText": "The NFL runs a risk every May when its schedule comes out – hoping those “TBD” slots it reserves for the Saturday of Week 18 ultimately get filled by games worthy of the standalone broadcast windows.\n\nJan. 3 provided further proof that the league knows what it’s doing – serving up a pair of matchups with massive postseason stakes. And even then, the schedule makers got another win – the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ 16-14 defeat of the Carolina Panthers actually failing to decide the NFC South title (more on that later).\n\nThat won’t be the case Saturday night, when the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks will definitively decide who wins the NFC West and the conference’s No. 1 overall playoff seed.\n\nBut, for now, here are the winners, losers – and otherwise – from Saturday’s games:\n\nThe Bucs and Panthers now knotted with 8-9 records, the winner of the division is still unknown. In a vacuum, Tampa Bay owns the common-games tiebreaker that puts the team in its near-perennial spot atop the division. But if the Falcons create a three-way tie by winning Sunday, Carolina would get the tiebreaker by virtue of a 3-1 mark against the Falcons and Bucs, eclipsing the other two teams.\n\nStill undefeated. The footing at Tampa's Raymond James Stadium was bad, and it was evident as players slipped, kicks were affected, and the general quality of play was impacted in such a critical game.\n\nThe home of “Monday Night Football” continues to enjoy an expanded presence late in the season, broadcasting both of Saturday’s consequential duels with another to come during the wild-card round of the playoffs. A year from now, ESPN will have the Super Bowl for the first time – though it will be simulcast on ABC. And Disney’s NFL footprint is only likely to continue growing ahead of its pending deal to acquire NFL Network, RedZone Channel and other media assets owned and controlled by the NFL, the crossover between the entities already readily apparent.\n\nHey, a team eliminated from postseason contention weeks ago now has something tangible to play for Sunday in its finale against the New Orleans Saints. Not only might a season-ending four-game winning streak save this coaching staff but knocking off the Bucs in the process would be especially sweet.\n\nThe Carolina running back, who ran for nearly 1,100 yards in 2024 for the Dallas Cowboys but was grossly undervalued by them and the free agent market has essentially matched that figure this season and earned a $1 million bonus Saturday by reaching 1,350 yards from scrimmage. Dowdle, who signed a $2.75 million contract with the Panthers before the season – and prior to hitting his incentive Saturday and others previously – should see a lot more green on the market a few months from now.\n\nIn what might have been the 14-year veteran's final game – or at least the linebacker's last one with the Bucs, his contract set to expire after the season – he recorded six stops Saturday to tie Hall of Famer Derrick Brooks as the most prolific tackler in franchise history.\n\nWith Carolina set up in the Bucs’ red zone early in the fourth quarter and trailing by nine, Dowdle slipped while tossing the ball back to QB Bryce Young on an apparent flea flicker. Fumble … and pretty much game, set and match. Tampa Bay didn't actually convert the turnover into points but did burn nearly six precious minutes off the clock before getting a field-goal try blocked. (Regardless, Dowdle still gets to keep his milli.)\n\nFUMBLE! The @Buccaneers jump on the loose ball 😤\n\nCARvsTB on ESPN/ABC\nStream on @NFLPlus and ESPN App pic.twitter.com/T7Pln5ymPn\n\nWhether it was the lateral that was prematurely blown dead − though the officials still moved the Panthers back 7 yards − or the dubious offensive pass interference against Tetairoa McMillan, which wiped out his 32-yard reception, the zebras were especially unkind to Carolina as it tried to whittle down a 13-6 halftime deficit.\n\nKicking off Saturday without injured starters – especially studs like all-universe LT Trent Williams and WR1 Ricky Pearsall – was hardly an ideal way to take on the mighty Seahawks defense with so much hanging in the balance.\n\nAll NFL news on and off the field. \n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: NFC South playoff spot up for grabs after Bucs top Panthers",

    "fullText": "Kansas City (6-10) at Las Vegas (2-14)\n\nAgainst the spread: Chiefs 6-10, Raiders 6-10.\n\nSeries record: Chiefs lead 76-55-2.\n\nLast meeting: Chiefs beat Raiders 31-0 on Oct. 19 at Kansas City.\n\nLast week: Chiefs lost to the Broncos 20-13; Raiders lost to the Giants 34-10.\n\nChiefs offense: overall (17), rush (23), pass (13), scoring (20).\n\nChiefs defense: overall (10), rush (10), pass (13), scoring (6).\n\nRaiders offense: overall (32), rush (32), pass (27), scoring (32).\n\nRaiders defense: overall (16), rush (18), pass (15), scoring (25).\n\nTurnover differential: Chiefs minus-1; Raiders minus-7.\n\nQB Chris Oladokun was forced into the starting role two weeks ago in Tennessee, when Gardner Minshew followed Patrick Mahomes by tearing ligaments in his knee. He then had to prepare for his first NFL start on Christmas night on just three days' notice, and wound up throwing for just 66 yards. Expect a better performance with 10 days to prepare for this one.\n\nQBs Kenny Pickett and Aidan O'Connell. With Geno Smith dealing with a significant ankle injury, coach Pete Carroll said he expected both to play. Each will have a chance to show that the Raiders should bring him back next season or for one of the other 31 clubs to take notice.\n\nRaiders RB Ashton Jeanty vs. Chiefs defensive front. This hasn't been the kind of season Jeanty envisioned, but he is 112 yards from 1,000. He might have trouble reaching that milestone against a Chiefs defense that ranks 10th in allowing 104.9 yards per game. But Kansas City has given up 409 yards rushing in missed tackles, according to Next Gen Stats. Jeanty has gained 350 yards after breaking tackles, so he might have a chance.\n\nChiefs: RG Trey Smith (ankle) is unlikely to play. The Chiefs already have OTs Jawaan Taylor, Wanya Morris and Josh Simmons on injured reserve, along with Mahomes, Minshew, CBs Trent McDuffie Chris Roland-Wallace and Jaylen Watson, LB Leo Chenal and WRs Rashee Rice, Nikko Remigio and Tyquan Thornton.\n\nRaiders: QB Geno Smith (ankle) likely won't play. ... DT Adam Butler (bicep) wasn’t as seriously hurt as feared and could play. ... LT Kolton Miller (ankle) likely won’t play.\n\nThe Chiefs have won the past three meetings, six of seven and 11 of 13. ... Kansas City has never lost in Las Vegas. The Chiefs are 5-0 against the Raiders at Allegiant Stadium, and KC defeated San Francisco in the Super Bowl two seasons ago. ... The Chiefs and Raiders have met in three playoff games with Kansas City winning two of them.\n\nKansas City has lost five straight and seven of its past nine. ... The Chiefs are assured of their first losing season since 2012, the year before Andy Reid took over as coach. They went 2-14 that season under Romeo Crennel. ... Kansas City has had 272 yards of offense combined over the past two weeks. It has not eclipsed 275 yards in any of its past four games. ... Chiefs TE Travis Kelce needs 46 yards receiving to reach 13,000 for his career. He has caught a pass in 189 consecutive games, the longest active streak in the NFL and longest streak in franchise history. ... DT Chris Jones needs one sack to tie Neil Smith (85 1/2) for third most in Chiefs history. ... The Raiders have lost 10 consecutive games, tied with a skid last season for the fifth-longest skid in franchise history. Another defeat would tie for the third longest which was set in the 2005-06 and 2006-07 seasons. The Raiders' longest losing streaks were 19 games in the 1961-62 seasons and 16 in 2013-14. ... Las Vegas' losing streak is the longest active one in the NFL. ... The Raiders have a point differential of minus-193, worst in the NFL. ... Their average point different is minus-12.1 per game. If it doesn't improve, that will be the highest since the 2020 New York Jets finished with a minus-13.4 average. ... RB Ashton Jeanty is one of two rookies ever with at least 800 yards rushing, five rushing touchdowns and five receiving TDs. The other is Hall of Famer Gale Sayers in 1965. ... LB Devin White's 168 tackles are second to Miami's Jordyn Brooks, who has 174. ... ... The Raiders have held opponents to zero or negative yards on 95 rushing plays, tied with Minnesota for best in the league. ... A victory would give Las Vegas coach Pete Carroll 173 for his career, which would move him into a tie for 16th with Jeff Fisher. Carroll is currently tied with Bill Parcells.\n\nThe Chiefs defense might be worth a look given the Raiders offensive struggles. They have failed to reach 30 points a franchise-worst 36 straight regular-season games.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "description": "Colts veteran defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo should be no stranger to upcoming open head coaching interviews.",
    "fullText": "According to ESPN’s Jordan Raanan, Indianapolis Colts veteran defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo is among the initial top interview candidates for the New York Giants current head coaching vacancy:\n\n“The first assignment is to find a new head coach. The Giants fired Brian Daboll almost eight weeks ago and named Mike Kafka the interim head coach,” writes Ranaan.\n\n“The team had a head start on compiling a list of candidates that includes former NFL head coach Mike McCarthy, Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley, Colts defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo, former Raiders coach and Giants player Antonio Pierce and Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula, among others. Kafka will also be given an interview.”\n\nWhoever is ultimately hired in New York will replace Brian Daboll, who coached the Giants from 2022-25.\n\nIt’s not the first time that Anarumo has been linked to an NFL head coaching opening, as he’s previously been connected in-season as a top candidate for the Tennessee Titans vacancy through multiple league reports respectively.\n\nNicknamed the “Mad Scientist,” the 59-year-old veteran defensive coordinator has been lauded for his ability to tailor his defensive gameplans weekly to stopping the opposing competition, even giving the likes of Kansas City Chiefs superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes some trouble in the past among other elite quarterbacks.\n\nIn his debut campaign with the Colts, there’s no question that Anarumo has been a significant upgrade to his Colts veteran defensive coordinator predecessor Gus Bradley.\n\nWhen healthy and going right, the Colts had a formidable unit this season.\n\nThat being said, after losing arguably the defense’s three best players down the season’s late stretch due to key injuries, namely to DeForest Buckner, Sauce Gardner, and Charvarius Ward, the Colts defense has since fallen on some hard times to close out this season. It no longer recently resembles the Top 10 defensive unit that it was for the majority of the 2025 campaign because of the loss of its best players.\n\nIt’s hard to win on defense in the NFL without your horses. Much less, there’s personnel issues with the Colts lack of consistent outside pass rush that go beyond Anarumo and key injuries down the final stretch.\n\nAnarumo has paid his coaching dues, has a track record of success, and is deserving of strong consideration for any NFL head coaching opening this upcoming offseason. However, it would be a real shame if he only gets to coach the Colts defense for one season. To me, he’s a top candidate to return in Indianapolis as defensive coordinator even in the rare case that Colts head coach Shane Steichen surprisingly doesn’t.\n\nGiven that we really didn’t see this unit fully together healthy upon Gardner’s arrival, Anarumo’s coaching best is still theoretically yet to come in Indianapolis—if we even get to see it again.",

    "title": "Drake Maye Could be the NFL MVP",
    "description": "It’s seemingly a race between him and Matthew Stafford, but just reaching this point is amazing for the UNC alum",
    "fullText": "After the 2024 draft, if you could have laid money down on which quarterback of the trio of Caleb Williams, Jayden Daniels, and Drake Maye would win the NFL MVP first, you probably would have gotten some long odds on Maye.\n\nOf the three, he was considered the biggest “project” going into the NFL. Those odds, if anything, seemed longer after the Washington Commanders invested heavily in their team going into the 2024 season and Daniels was able to take his team to the NFC Title game, losing to the eventual champ Philadelphia Eagles. Meanwhile, the Patriots were still suffering from the malaise at the end of the Bill Belichick era as first-year coach Jerod Mayo struggled to find any traction, and while Maye had showed some promise he ended his season on the sidelines as the Patriots tried — and failed — to get the number one overall pick for 2025.\n\nSo the deck seemed stacked for Maye to have an ascendent season. Mayo was out right after that last game, and Maye didn’t really provide much comment to reporters when the season concluded. In came Mike Vrabel as the head coach and Josh McDaniels as the offensive coordinator. The Patriots made moves in the offseason, but staring at being in the same division as the Buffalo Bills and 2024 MVP Josh Allen, the vibe for the team going into 2025 was hoping to use an easier schedule to finish above .500 and build toward having a consistent team for the first time in years.\n\nAfter a start that seemed to be what people were expecting, Maye had a signature game against Allen and the Bills in front of a national audience in Buffalo. It was enough to where Mike Tirico and Cris Collinsworth were calling for respect to be given to Maye and the offense, and included a game-winning field goal drive. That game was one of a ten-game winning streak for New England, and during that stretch highlight after highlight would pop on social media.\n\nMaye and the Patriots stumbled against the Bills after the bye and were again on Sunday Night Football, this time against Baltimore. By this point talk had gotten loud of Maye being the NFL MVP, but his loss to Buffalo seemingly ceded the title to the Rams’ Matthew Stafford. That week, though, things seemingly flipped back in Maye’s favor. First off, the other seeming contender in Matthew Stafford lost a close game to Seattle on Thursday Night and ceded control of the division to the Seahawks. Then on Sunday, Maye delivered yet another signature performance that included an 11-point fourth-quarter comeback, 380 yards in the air, two touchdowns, and a game-clinching run after the defense helped give the team a chance.\n\nEdge of our seats 🤯 pic.twitter.com/oVUiYbocXZ\n\n— z – New England Patriots (@Patriots) December 23, 2025\n\nMaye followed that up this past weekend with a foot-on-the-throat approach that showed he and the Patriots may have found another gear.\n\nDrake Maye MVP level performance was legendary against the #Jets\n\nFirst QB to ever have 90% completion percentage, 250+ yards and 5 TDS.#NEPats \n\n pic.twitter.com/DNAGtE3U2r\n\n— NFL Numbers Guy (@NFLNumbersGuy) December 29, 2025\n\nMatthew Stafford followed by losing to the Atlanta Falcons on the road and now all of a sudden, Drake Maye is the betting favorite to win the MVP. He would be the first Tar Heel alum to do so since Lawrence Taylor in 1986.\n\nAll of this is bittersweet for UNC fans. Earlier in the week on 98.5 The Sports Hub, a host during drive time was recounting this historic rise and mused “he’s obviously so talented you look at those years at North Carolina and wonder how they didn’t win more.” Fans likely felt that disturbance in the force and screamed “MACK BROWN, PHIL LONGO, AND CHIP LINDSEY!” Those that watched those amazing two years of Maye under center could see the talent, the skill and know that the combination of inept coaching on defense and some lack of support on offense really kept Maye from achieving the heights he should have.\n\nStill, it’s a source of pride for UNC fans that had to hear in the lead-up to the draft about how Maye was the weakest of the top three. Those that watched knew, and there’s a delicious irony that the former Patriots and current UNC coach likely wouldn’t have taken Maye for that team — and now Maye is on the doorstep of his first major NFL award and leading the Patriots back to the top tier of the NFL.",

    "description": "Returning to the Colts didn't just mean another hefty paycheck for Philip Rivers. It meant access to a strong health plan for another five years.",
    "fullText": "Philip Rivers caused quite a stir when he returned to the NFL in December 2025 as a 44-year-old grandpa.\n\nThe Indianapolis Colts, plagued by injuries and with limited options, called up their former quarterback to try to salvage a season that started red-hot. Rivers spent the majority of his NFL career with the San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers, but signed with the Colts in 2020 and played one full season before retiring after a playoff loss in January 2021.\n\nAnother clock reset as soon as he was added to the Colts' active roster: Rivers extended his NFL-sponsored health insurance, which was set to expire in 2026, by another five years.\n\nThis benefit emerged from the 2006 NFL-NFLPA agreement, which stipulates that players who are on any NFL roster for three or more seasons are entitled to five years of health insurance after retirement.\n\nIt's particularly advantageous to Rivers, a father of 10. Each of his kids is under the age of 26, making them each eligible as dependents. His wife, Tiffany, is also eligible.\n\nAs for the actual medical plan, here are some highlights of his benefits, as outlined in The NFL Player Insurance Plan published in 2020.\n\nHealth insurance plans vary tremendously from company to company, and also from plan to plan within the same company. I decided to see how the NFL plan stacks up to the High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) I'm enrolled in. Compare it to yours if you're curious.\n\nAnnual deductible. This is the amount you pay each year before insurance starts covering most costs.\n\nNFL plan: $850 per person / $1,700 per family\n\nMy HDHP: $3,000 per person / $6,000 per family\n\nWhile an NFL player only has to spend $850 on covered care before insurance kicks in, I'd have to spend $3,000 out-of-pocket before coverage begins. Note that my plan literally has \"high deductible\" in its name, but the tradeoffs for high upfront costs include a lower premium and access to a tax-advantaged savings account called an HSA.\n\nOut-of-pocket maximum. This is the most you have to pay in a year for covered health care, after which the insurance plan pays 100% of covered costs for the rest of that plan year.\n\nNFL plan: $2,000 per person / $5,000 per family\n\nMy HDHP: $6,000 per person / $12,000 per family\n\nWith a cap of $2,000 per person, an NFL player's worst-case medical year is fairly limited, whereas I'd be on the hook for $6,000. Of course, I'm taking fewer hits working behind a desk rather than behind an offensive line.\n\nPremium. This is the fixed amount you pay regularly — usually every month — to keep your health insurance active.\n\nNFL plan: $0/month. According to the 2020 NFL Player Insurance Plan, \"The Clubs fund the NFL Player Trust that pays for the benefits provided and insurance premiums owed under the Plan.\"\n\nMy HDHP: I also pay $0. Again, the tradeoff is the higher deductible.\n\nFor Rivers, returning to the Colts didn't just mean another hefty paycheck; it meant access to a strong health plan with low deductibles, capped out-of-pocket costs, and broad medical coverage.\n\nThe Colts are officially out of the playoffs, and he'll be sitting out during Week 18. If he retires for good this year, he and his family don't have to worry about shopping around for insurance until 2031.",

New Orleans Saints passer Tyler Shough and Tennessee Titans first overall pick Cam Ward were featured in a Mic'd Up clip from NFL Films to give us a look at each rookie's day at the office. It's clear they both have a strong presence, but you can see why guys are rallying around Shough after the Saints had a rough start to the season.\n\n\"Do your job all day,\" Shough said in the huddle, \"Great feet, great eyes, great technique. Make a play.\"\n\nIt's also clear that Shough has developed great chemistry with his leading wide receiver Chris Olave. He approached Olave on the bench late in regulation to tell him, \"We got to throw the ball to win the game. Throw the ball to win the game so whatever it takes bro.\" After connecting with Olave on a touchdown pass, the pair celebrated all the way back to the bench.\n\n\"Oh my God. Oh my God,\" Shough gasped, leaping to chest-bump Olave. \"I told you I'm gonna get you.\"\n\nShough vs Ward Mic'd Up 🔊\n\nJust 2 rising rookies putting on a clinic@Saints | @Titans | @InsideTheNFL pic.twitter.com/j6bm1njj8t\n\n— NFL Films (@NFLFilms) December 31, 2025\n\nIt's a really cool look at how Shough conducts himself on game days.

    "fullText": "The marathon is over. Sunday marks the end of the NFL regular season.\n\nIn recent years, Week 18 has signaled the end for the Chicago Bears. Not so this year. For the first time since 2020, the Bears are headed to the postseason. They have bigger goals on the horizon, starting with next week’s wild-card round of the playoffs.\n\nBut first, they have a matchup with the Detroit Lions. Sunday’s game has playoff implications. The simplest result is this: Win Sunday and they lock up the No. 2 seed in the NFC and a matchup with the No. 7 Green Bay Packers. A loss complicates matters a little, but the Bears are at least guaranteed a home game as NFC North champions.\n\nBears coach Ben Johnson already has declared his team is “playing to win.” Lions coach Dan Campbell said his squad will be competing, despite the fact they have nothing left to play for.\n\nThe Bears (11-5) square off against the Lions (8-8) on Sunday at Soldier Field (3:25 p.m., Fox-32). Here are five things to watch ahead of Week 18 — plus the Tribune’s predictions for the game.\n\nThe NFL season is a brutal, physical journey from the time training camp starts in July until the playoffs in January.\n\n“This is a race,” Johnson said on the day training camp began in July. The Bears are nearly at the end of the race now, and it has been a marathon more than a sprint.\n\nJust think about where the Bears and the Lions were nearly four months ago. In Week 2, the Lions cruised to a 52-21 win over the Bears at Ford Field. The Bears fell to 0-2, while the Lions looked like the team that won 15 games a year ago.\n\n“It’s early in the season and you’re still getting to know your team a little bit,” Johnson said this week as he reflected on that game. “Being in that locker room after that game and how that felt — you don’t always remember exactly what was said or anything like that, but you always remember how you felt in those moments.”\n\nMuch has changed in the 15 weeks since then. The Bears are gearing up for a playoff run, and the Lions will be watching the postseason from home. Things change rapidly in the NFL. After that loss in Detroit, the Bears won their next four games and nine of 10.\n\nThe Lions, on the other hand, started the season 7-4 and in a favorable position before losing four of the next five. A Christmas Day loss in Minnesota eliminated the Lions from postseason contention.\n\nCampbell suggested the Lions will play their starters, but he left some gray area with regard to players battling injury, which includes top receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and tackle Penei Sewell.\n\n“I think if it’s — we’re sitting there borderline, and the player, it could be hard (to play) or we think they’re setting themselves up for a long-term risk, then no, it’s not worth it,” Campbell told members of the Detroit media.\n\nWilliams needs 109 passing yards to break the Bears’ single-season record. Erik Kramer set the mark with 3,838 yards in 1995. Jay Cutler came close to topping it with 3,812 yards in 2014, but the record has stood for 30 years.\n\nChicago Bears QB Caleb Williams on 4,000 yards: ‘I was brought here for those types of things’\n\nWilliams has surpassed 109 passing yards in every game this season. Also in play is a 4,000-yard season, something no Bears quarterback has done. Ever. With 3,730 yards this season, Williams needs 270 to reach the milestone.\n\nThe primary goal remains to win the game. But Williams said this week that he believes he’s in Chicago to rewrite the record books at the quarterback position.\n\n“In 100 or however many years, it has never been done,” Williams said. “So it symbolizes something.”\n\nWilliams has played some of his best football over the last three games. In wins against the Cleveland Browns and Packers and a road loss to the San Francisco 49ers, he has averaged 274 passing yards with six touchdown passes and zero interceptions.\n\n“I’m playing better than I have,” Williams said. “These last three games, but even going back to some of the other games, some of the stats may not show it, but I feel that I’m playing better. I said it’s going to start showing here soon, and that’s a small sample of that. I’ve got to keep growing, keep getting better.”\n\nAbout that Week 2 beatdown in Detroit …\n\nThat’s exactly the type of game that the old Bears would’ve let bleed into the next week. A year ago, this same franchise lost on a brutal Hail Mary at Washington and went on to lose 10 consecutive games. Losing became inevitable.\n\nWhile the early-season loss in Detroit might have felt like a “here we go again” moment, Johnson has never let his team think too much about any one game.\n\n“That can kind of go one or two ways after that, right?” linebacker T.J. Edwards said. “And I think that shows where we’re at right now … having that belief in one another. It’s rare to have in a team where everyone is on the same page and everyone is understanding what we’re trying to get done. When those things are going wrong, it allows us to come together and make sure that it doesn’t stay that way.”\n\nColumn: Chicago Bears are ‘moving on to Detroit’ — but they won’t go far in playoffs if defense doesn’t improve\n\nIt’s a pertinent message this week, when the Bears are looking to brush off Sunday night’s loss in San Francisco. The Bears have built all sorts of momentum this season. They’ve been, all things considered, relatively healthy. Although the defense struggled against the 49ers, the team has played well overall during the toughest part of the schedule down the stretch.\n\n“It kind of just goes with Ben’s messaging every week,” Edwards said. “He’s been the same. He’s been consistent. So it’s easy for us to kind of follow. But it’s a week-to-week league, right? So after big wins, celebrate for a second and then you’ve got to get back to work, and after big losses it’s no different because there’s another one coming up.”\n\nThe Bears want to head into the postseason on a positive note. A win against the Lions would do that.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles and Washington Commanders will also kick off at 3:25 p.m. If the Bears lose Sunday and the Eagles win, the Eagles would jump the Bears for the No. 2 seed, dropping the Bears to No. 3.\n\nThe No. 2 seed will play the Packers, who are locked in at No. 7. The No. 3 seed will play someone from the NFC West, either the 49ers or Los Angeles Rams.\n\nThe Bears probably would rather take their chances against the Packers, a team they’ve played close twice already, winning once in dramatic fashion. The No. 2 seed also would play at home in the divisional round if it wins its first playoff game.\n\nReports out of Philadelphia have suggested the Eagles might sit their starters Sunday. That will be a situation to monitor. The Commanders, though, could start third-string quarterback Josh Johnson, so anything could happen even if the Eagles rest up for the playoffs.\n\nJohnson has said the Bears are playing to win, but might that change if the Eagles are down by two touchdowns at halftime?\n\nOdunze has missed four games with a foot injury. The Bears receiver hasn’t played since Nov. 28 in Philadelphia. Odunze has not participated in practice this week.\n\n“We’ll see how this week goes,” Johnson said when asked about Odunze.\n\nRookie receiver Luther Burden III suffered a quad injury on the last play against the 49ers but has been back on the practice field this week. That’s a good sign for the Bears.\n\nIn Detroit, a number of key starters have been on the injury report, including linebacker Alex Anzalone (concussion), defensive tackle Alim McNeill (abdomen), Sewell (ankle), St. Brown (knee/ankle) and left tackle Taylor Decker (shoulder/illness).\n\nBoth teams will release one more injury report Friday.\n\nThe Bears are looking to tighten things up defensively after a woeful showing in San Francisco and along come the Lions, who have some key injury concerns on offense involving wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and left tackle Taylor Decker, among others. Injuries also have rocked the Lions secondary, and opposing quarterbacks, with the exception of Minnesota Vikings undrafted rookie Max Brosmer last week, have lit up the Lions of late. The Bears have plenty of motivation with the No. 2 seed in the NFC there for the taking, even with reports that the Eagles, also in contention for that seed, are expected to rest key players for their finale against the Commanders.\n\nWeek 18 is weird. But I’m going to take Johnson’s word when he says the Bears are playing to win. I’m not convinced the Lions truly are, no matter what they say. They have nothing to play for. Beyond Week 18 weirdness, though, the Bears have shown in the second half of the season that they’re the better team. I think they cap off a remarkable turnaround with win No. 12.\n\nThe Lions are fizzling to a disappointing finish. The Bears have several incentives in this rematch: Secure the No. 2 seed, redeem the loss of a winnable game against the 49ers and avenge Week 2’s blowout loss in which the Lions ran up the score (don’t let anyone convince you otherwise). The Bears need to sharpen all phases heading into the playoffs, and the injury-riddled Lions look like sacrificial lambs.",

    "fullText": "Auburn football wide receiver Eric Singleton has punched his ticket to the 2026 NFL Draft. His announcement came via his social media.\n\nA massive transfer from Georgia Tech for the Tigers a year ago, Singleton played a total of three seasons in his collegiate. He spent two seasons with the Yellow Jackets recording over 700 yards in both seasons. This year with the Tigers he finished with 534 yards receiving on 57 receptions and three touchdowns. Singleton career totals were 2,002 yards receiving on 162 receptions and 12 receiving touchdowns.\n\nHugh Freeze's offense never seemed to fully unlock Singleton's potential at Auburn. The junior wide receiver had his lowest receiving and total yards at Auburn. Singleton did see a uptick after the Freeze firing and offensive coordinator Derrick Nix took over play calling. Against Vanderbilt, he hauled in 11 passes for 102 yards and a touchdown\n\nPreseason CBS Sports ranked him a top-10 receiver in the 2026 draft. Singleton's draft stock could rise in the coming months at the NFL Combine with a chance to showcase his speed and route running ability.\n\nContact/Follow us @TheAuburnWire on  X (Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Auburn news, notes, and opinions.

From 2023 t0 2025, though, that number dropped to just an average of 70, 56 fewer underclassmen per class and a 44 percent overall drop in underclassmen declaring.\n\nWith direct payments from schools to players now allowed, plus the NFL still having a rookie wage scale, you could see even more kids elect to return to college football this season.

    "fullText": "One of Missouri football’s best defensive players from the 2025 season is entering the NFL Draft process early.\n\nRedshirt sophomore Josiah Trotter, who spent one season with the Tigers and starred at the second level of Mizzou’s 2025 defense, has declared for the NFL Draft as a third-year entrant, he announced via his social media on Thursday, Jan. 1.\n\nIf he wanted them, Trotter had two years of remaining eligibility. He started his career at West Virginia and redshirted his first year in the sport. Trotter was a freshman All-American for the Mountaineers in 2024 before transferring to Mizzou.\n\nInstead, he’ll go through the draft process, and all indications suggest he will be a top-100 prospect this year.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Mizzou learned that fellow third-year and potential NFL Draft entrant Cayden Green will not declare for the draft and instead will return to Columbia in 2026.\n\nAll Glory to God pic.twitter.com/LB5N0p9DEv\n\n— Josiah Trotter (@TrotterJosiah) January 2, 2026\n\nThe Tigers are now waiting on a decision from one final third-year player: defensive end Damon Wilson II, who can stay or declare for the draft.\n\nTrotter was Mizzou’s leading tackler in his lone season in Columbia, racking up 84 total tackles, which included 13 hits behind the line of scrimmage and two sacks.\n\nPro Football Focus graded Trotter as the third-best run-stopping linebacker in the Southeastern Conference and as a top-five pass-rushing LB in the league.\n\nHe has significant professional pedigree in his family.\n\nHis father, Jeremiah Trotter Sr., was a four-time Pro Bowler and Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Famer who spent more than a decade in the league.\n\nJosiah Trotter’s older brother, Jeremiah Trotter Jr., was on the Eagles roster than won the Super Bowl last season.\n\nMock Draft Database has Trotter listed at No. 107 on its consensus big board for the 2026 draft, which is a fourth-round slot. It would not be a surprise to see the 6-foot-2, 237-pound linebacker climb higher as he goes through the NFL Scouting Combine and Pro Day.\n\nIt’s a significant loss for Mizzou’s defense.\n\nThe Tigers announced earlier Thursday that standout sophomore Nicholas Rodriguez will return in 2026. But, Mizzou is also set to lose two more players from its core, four-player rotation in Khalil Jacobs and Triston Newson to eligibility.\n\nThat means Missouri likely will be active in the transfer portal looking to fill those gaps.\n\nMore: Missouri football needs a QB for 2026.

    "description": "The NFL wraps up the 2025-26 regular season this weekend with Week 18. We break down which teams have something to play for and who is resting players.",
    "fullText": "We’ve made it! Week 18 of the NFL season is here and soon the playoffs will commence. But, we do have a few loose ends to tie up before we get to all that. We have the bulk of the teams destined for the playoffs already known, but there are a few stragglers and of course the dreaded jockeying for playoffs seeding. Guessing what NFL coaches will do is not something you want to make a living off of. But, we should be able to narrow this down enough to have a good idea as to who needs to win, who wants to win, and who doesn’t care if they win.\n\nBookmark this post, as we will continue to update as news comes in.\n\nThe Falcons gave the Buccaneers some late Christmas coal in their stocking by beating the Rams in Week 17. If the Falcons win this week over the Saints, the Buccaneers are eliminated from the playoffs even if they beat the Panthers on Saturday. The good news for us playing fantasy is that the NFL made that scenario moot with the Saturday game. Both teams will play for the win. If the Panthers win, they win the division and the playoff spot. If the Bucs win, they have to wait for the winner of the Falcons-Saints to decide the NFC South champion between the Panthers and Bucs.\n\nThis game isn’t as desperate as win and in, but whoever wins will get the No. 1 seed in the NFC and whoever loses will fall to the No. 5 seed. This one is pretty cut and dry and both teams will play their starters in hopes for a win.\n\nThe Steelers blew a chance to wrap up the AFC North as they laid an egg against the Browns in Week 17. The Ravens won their game against the Packers, making this matchup for all the marbles. Whoever wins, wins the North, the No. 4 seed, and the only playoff spot left in the AFC.\n\nThe Chargers have already announced they are resting Justin Herbert. The Broncos on the other hand need a win to get the No. 1 seed, which comes with a bye and home field advantage throughout the playoffs. They can still get that No. 1 seed if they lose and the Jaguars and Patriots both lose, but they won’t leave that one up for chance. They should play their starters until the game is in hand.\n\nThe Dolphins have nothing to play for, but the Patriots could finish with the 1, 2, or 3 seed in the AFC. To get the No. 1 seed they will need to win and for the Broncos to lose to the Chargers who are resting Herbert. If the Broncos win, the Patriots just need to beat the Dolphins to get the No. 2 seed. They could also lose and as long as the Jaguars lose, they’d still get the No. 2 seed. If they lose and both the Jaguars and Broncos win, then they end up with the No. 3 seed.\n\nThe Patriots should want that No. 2 seed enough to play all out.\n\nThe Titans have been eliminated from playoff contention for a while now and a loss can only help their draft position. The Jaguars on the other hand have come on like gangbusters and even have an outside shot at the No. 1 seed with a win. Unfortunately, the Chargers going with Trey Lance over Justin Herbert and the Patriots getting a relatively easy matchup with the Dolphins likely throws a wrench in those plans, as they’d need both teams to lose to get that coveted 1 seed.\n\nThe Jaguars do have to beat the Titans if they want to secure the AFC South title over the Texans, and the No. 3 seed though. And, a win of course gives them a shot at the No. 1 and 2 seeds if the Broncos or Patriots were to falter. They theoretically could fall all the way to the No. 7 seed with a loss. So they’re playing to win.\n\nThe Colts have been eliminated and will give rookie quarterback Riley Leonard the start over Phillip Rivers. The Texans have a wide variety of seedings possible between the No. 3 seed and the No. 7 seed. A win and a Jaguars loss to the Titans would give them the AFC South title and the No. 3 seed. A win secures them the No. 5 seed if the Jaguars win, while a loss could knock them down to the No. 6 or 7 seeds. These scenarios should be enough for them to do everything they can to win this week.\n\nIf the Bears win, they get the No. 2 seed. If they lose and the Eagles win, they get the No. 3 seed. Head coach Ben Johnson appeared adamant that they would play to win after their loss to the 49ers. A win and they face the Packers in the first round of the playoffs. If they lose, they’ll get the No. 3 seed and either face the 49ers or Rams at home. I’d expect them to play to win, but if news changes, we’ll update this post.\n\nThe Eagles and Bears are tied together this week as they both hope to grab the No. 2 seed in the NFC. The Bears have the inside track, as a win gives them the No. 2 seed, while the Eagles need a win and for the Bears to lose. When asked, head coach Nick Sirianni was non-committal as to if anyone would rest. The Eagles are guaranteed the No. 3 seed if they lose and/or the Bears win, but the No. 2 seed is worth playing for if they want.\n\nThe Jets have been out of contention for a while now and need a loss to keep or better their current No. 3 pick. The Bills currently have the final playoff seed at No. 7, but could move up to No. 5 or 6 with a win. To move up to the No. 5 seed they’ll need to win and for the Texans and Chargers to lose. To get the No. 6 seed they’ll need to win and have one of the Texans or Chargers lose.\n\nAt this point we’re waiting on head coach Sean McDermott to give us more intel on if he’ll play starters, but we do know all world QB Josh Allen isn’t 100% right now and beating the Jets isn’t exactly that tough. If I were them, I’d rest Allen. And at this point I wouldn’t want to trust Bills starters in fantasy games.\n\nHead coach Sean McVay says his starters will play this week, but there isn’t a whole lot to play for. If they win and the 49ers lose, they’d get the No. 5 seed. All other scenarios end them with the No. 6 seed. I could see McVay giving his starters a half and then shutting things down. I’d rather not rely on Rams players this week if I can help it.\n\nUPDATE 1/1 — Chris Olave will not play on Sunday. Nick Underhill is reporting a blood clot was detected in his lung. He will be fine, but is not going to play the season finale.\n\nThe Saints and Falcons are both eliminated from playoff contention, but Saturday afternoon could open the door this game to mean something. If the Bucs beat the Panthers on Saturday, a Falcons win over the Saints would clinch the NFC South for the Panthers. Even if the Panthers win on Saturday and clinch the division, Saints-Falcons is one of the more entertaining rivalries from the fans’ perspective. Whether it impacts the starting options for each team is unclear.\n\nJim Harbaugh announced that Trey Lance would get the start in Week 18 against the Broncos, which likely means other starters should see rest or limited work as well. But, even if all the other starters were a go, Lance is going to have a hell of a time against the Broncos defense in Denver.\n\nUPDATE 1/1 — Jordan Love has passed concussion protocol, but with the Packers unable to move out of the No. 7 seed, Clayton Tune will get the start, per Jason B. Hirschhorn.\n\nThe Packers are locked into the No. 7 seed, so they will rest key starters.\n\nThe Raiders and Chiefs have no playoff hopes left, but the Raiders currently have the No. 1 pick in the 2026 drat and they’d like to keep it. They’ve sat their best defensive player Maxx Crosby and now they’re going to sit Geno Smith for a combination of Kenny Pickett and Aidan O’Connell, per Vinny Bonsignore.",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Times NFL writer Sam Farmer examines the matchups and makes his predictions for Week 18 of the NFL season.\n\nAll lines and over/under numbers are according to FanDuel Sportsbook.\n\nLast week, Farmer posted a 9-7 (.563) record. Through the first 17 weeks of the season, he is 164-92 (.641).\n\nUsing point spreads with the scores Farmer predicted, his record against the spread in Week 17 would have been 4-12 (.333). For the season, his record against the spread is 120-136 (.469).\n\nAll times are Pacific and TV reflects broadcasts in the Los Angeles area.\n\nSaturday, 1:30 p.m. TV: ABC, ESPN.\n\nLine: Buccaneers by 3. O/U: 44½.\n\nThis was a three-point win by the Panthers when these teams met two weeks ago and figures to be just about that close in the rematch. Hard to trust Tampa Bay, which has lost seven of its last eight games. This showdown comes down to the wire and Carolina wins with a field goal to clinch the NFC South title.\n\nPick: Panthers 24, Buccaneers 21\n\nSaturday, 5 p.m. TV: ABC, ESPN.\n\nLine: Seahawks by 1½. O/U: 49½.\n\nAs hot as Seattle is, San Francisco is surging and has the experience and home crowd at its back. It will be a really physical game and the winner claims the conference title. Seattle has lost seven of eight to the 49ers with the only win being last season and by three points.\n\nSunday, 10 a.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nThe Packers are locked in as the No. 7 seed, and the Vikings are playing for pride. Have to believe with all the injuries his team has dealt with, Green Bay coach Matt LaFleur is going to make preserving health a priority. So no matter what happens at quarterback, I like the Vikings winning at home.\n\nSunday, 10 a.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nThe Philip Rivers experiment was so much fun, but now it’s back to planning for the future with Riley Leonard. Division crown is a longshot for Texans, but they can still improve their seeding.\n\nSunday, 10 a.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nLine: Jaguars by 11½. O/U: 47½.\n\nThe Titans were on the wrong end of a laugher when these teams met at the end of last month. Now they’re playing for pride whereas the Jaguars have every incentive to keep their foot on the gas. The Jaguars have won seven in a row, averaging 30 points during that streak.\n\nSunday, 10 a.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nHere are a couple teams who are out of the playoff race but have assembled winning streaks. The Falcons handled the Saints pretty easily in New Orleans last month and should win a closer game at home.\n\nSunday, 10 a.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nIt’s a small consolation but the Cowboys are determined to finish with a .500 record, so they’re incentivized. Pride and a pass rush will keep the three-win Giants in this one. Figures to be reasonably high-scoring, although that could be tempered by a bitter-cold breeze.\n\nSunday, 10 a.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nBengals coach Zac Taylor says it’s “an absolute nightmare” for his team to face Myles Garrett, and that might be so, but Cincinnati gets the edge in this one. Joe Burrow over Shedeur Sanders. The Bengals have six wins and the Browns have four. Do you still call that state bragging rights?\n\nCertainly not a meaningless game for the Rams. They need to gather some momentum heading into the postseason, because at the moment they’re rolling backward. The Cardinals have surrendered an average of 37 points in the past four games (all losses). Rams roll, but what does it portend?\n\nLine: Broncos by 11½. O/U: 36½.\n\nThe Chargers are resting Justin Herbert and other starters, so this is about getting out of Denver without injuries. Trey Lance has accounted for himself well in those rare chances he gets, but he’ll be under heavy pressure from that Broncos pass rush. These teams keep it on the ground to make it a quick one.\n\nSunday, 1:25 p.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nThe Bears need to recapture some of their swagger after losing at San Francisco, and the Lions are leaking confidence by the week. Six turnovers? Really? The Lions are going to play hard for Dan Campbell, but disdain for a division rival will only take them so far.\n\nSunday, 1:25 p.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nThe Bills can improve their playoff seeding with a win, and the Jets have packed it in for the season. Buffalo needs to wash away the foul taste of that one-point loss to Philadelphia, plus the Bills want to turn off the lights at Highmark Stadium in style. Should be pretty lopsided.\n\nSunday, 1:25 p.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nTalk about coming full circle. This will feel like an exhibition game. Better buy a program so you can figure out who’s on the field. The Chiefs have a better roster, and they feed the ball at Travis Kelce early and often. Disappointing seasons for a pair of future Hall of Fame coaches.\n\nSunday, 1:25 p.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nLine: Patriots by 10½. O/U: 45½.\n\nThe No. 1 seed is within reach for the Patriots. The Dolphins are playing for pride and individual contract incentives. Barring a bizarre twist, this one is pretty straight-forward. Mike Vrabel has his New England players ready to enter the playoffs on a roll — and in the frosty cold.\n\nSunday, 1:25 p.m. TV: NFL Ticket.\n\nThe Eagles and Bears kick off at the same time, so Philadelphia will have to play hard in case it can move up for that No. 2 seed. Washington put up something of a fight when these teams met two weeks ago. Philadelphia is prone to offensive lapses, though, so this might not be a blowout.\n\nSunday, 5:20 p.m. TV: NBC, Peacock.\n\nIt’s winner-take-all in the AFC North. Judging by their performances last week, the Ravens should win going away. But that’s not how this rivalry works. These games are almost always super close, and Pittsburgh rarely loses at home to Baltimore. Aaron Rodgers comes through.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Mile High Report’s Christopher Hart gives his picks for Week 18 of the 2025 NFL regular season.",
    "fullText": "Week 18 of the NFL regular season is finally here. I was 10-6 with my Week 17 picks. With just sixteen games left, I’m 170-86 on the season. That’s over 65-percent accuracy which is quite good, but far below my 70-percent average from last season. Let’s see how well I do for the final week of regular season games.\n\nSaturday Football (Afternoon Game) — Carolina Panthers at Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nWith the Atlanta Falcons upsetting the Los Angeles Rams on Monday Night Football, the Buccaneers’ path to the postseason had a wrench thrown int. They must now win and have the New Orleans Saints defeat the Atlanta Falcons to secure the NFC South and earn a playoff berth. That’s unfortunate news for them. Can they finally end their four-game win streak and do their part to get to the postseason? I think so.\n\nSaturday Football (Night Game) — Seattle Seahawks at San Francisco 49ers\n\nThis NFC West heavyweight matchup is for the division title and the number one seed in the NFC. Both of these teams have defied the odds and impressed all season. This is going to be a must-watch game for all football fans. The 49ers inched out a close victory in their first matchup in Week 1. I expect this will be another close game. I’ve got the 49ers finding a way to gut this key game out in front of a hometown crowd.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — New Orleans Saints at Atlanta Falcons\n\nBoth the Saints and Falcons have reeled off multi-game winning streaks after starting off the season horribly. As mentioned above, Tampa Bay fans are desperately hoping the Saints finish the season off on a high note and earn their fifth-straight victory. And guess what? I’m predicting that to happen. Based on my picks, the Buccaneers are in the playoffs as the NFC South champions.\n\nSunday Football (Earl Game) — Cleveland Browns at Cincinnati Bengals\n\nThe Browns were able to upset the Pittsburgh Steelers and play spoiler last weekend. I don’t expect them to have the same success against the Bengals, who have notched back-to-back wins with impressive offensive performances. I’ve got Cincinnati at home in this one.\n\n\"That was sick.\"\n\nMic'd Up | @altafiber pic.twitter.com/L23CO3bMBo\n\n— Cincinnati Bengals (@Bengals) December 31, 2025\n\nSaturday Football (Evening Game) — Green Bay Packers at Minnesota Vikings\n\nThe Packers have dropped three in a row. Luckily, they already punched their postseason ticket. Meanwhile, the Vikings are riding a four-game winning streak. I’m not sure if the Packers are expected to rest players or not. They are the seven seed in the NFC regardless of the outcome. My bet is that is the case. With that in mind, I’ll take Minnesota at home.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Dallas Cowboys at New York Giants\n\nAnother game, another division rivalry matchup. With the Giants beating the Las Vegas Raiders last week, they find themselves on the outside looking in with respect to the #1 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. The Cowboys? Out of the playoffs for the second season in a row. Even so, I’ve still got Dallas winning this one.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Tennessee Titans at Jacksonville Jaguars\n\nThere are some ways the Jaguars can still be the #1 seed in the AFC. That seems improbable. With a win against the Titans, they will be the AFC South champions and get to host a playoff game. I feel confident that scenario will happen.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Indianapolis Colts at Houston Texans\n\nAfter a rough start to the year, DeMeco Ryans and the Texans have really done well down the stretch. Their defense has been the strength of their team that has carried them all season long. I’m predicting a win at home, which will likely lock them in as the #5 seed in the AFC playoff race.\n\nSafe to say we were all feeling the same way as Coach 😅\n\n🤘 | #SonyPartner pic.twitter.com/RV3lcloW0P\n\n— Houston Texans (@HoustonTexans) December 31, 2025\n\nSunday Football (Afternoon Game) — New York Jets at Buffalo Bills\n\nA failed two-point conversion attempt at the end of last week’s game officially kicked the Bills out of contending for the AFC East title. That belongs to the New England Patriots. Regardless, I think they will find a way to beat the Jets who’ve been awful the entire season. I’m taking Buffalo at home.\n\nSunday Football (Afternoon Game) — Detroit Lions at Chicago Bears\n\nWith the Bears losing to the 49ers, they have no shot at the #1 seed in the NFC. They are assured the second or third seed no matter what happens in this game. Some thought Ben Johnson might rest his players, but he stated earlier in the week they are playing to win—indicating the starters will be a go for Sunday’s division rivalry game against the Lions. Division games are always tough, and the Lions are a gritty team, but I think the Bears find a way to end the season off with a big victory. I’m taking Chicago.\n\nSunday Football (Late Game) — Kansas City Chiefs at Las Vegas Raiders\n\nIt makes my heart smile the Chiefs and Raiders have had down seasons. I don’t really care who wins this game. I’m taking Kansas City here which will officially gift the Raiders the #1 pick next April.\n\nSunday Football (Early Game) — Los Angeles Chargers at Denver Broncos\n\nThe Chargers and Broncos are both in the playoffs. Los Angeles will be a wild card team, but the Broncos can earn the AFC’s top seed, first-round bye and homefield advantage by taking down their rivals in front of Broncos Country on Sunday. That’s a result I’m hoping for and believe will happen. Obviously, I’m taking Denver.\n\nThrowing it 🔙 at @EmpowerField this Sunday 😤 pic.twitter.com/W6u2xonlyU\n\n— Denver Broncos (@Broncos) December 30, 2025\n\nSunday Football (Afternoon Game) — Miami Dolphins at New England Patriots\n\nIf the Patriots beat the Dolphins and the Broncos lose to the Chargers, New England will be the top seed in the AFC. With that at stake, they will certainly be playing their starters. I believe Drake Maye, who might even be the front runner for MVP honors, is going to have another huge game and deliver the Patriots their fourteen victory of the season.\n\nSunday Football (Afternoon Game) — Arizona Cardinals at Los Angeles Rams\n\nAfter their last second loss to the Falcons, the Rams are now relegated to being either the fifth or sixth seed in the NFC. Bummer for them. Whether they rest their starters or not, I think they defeat the Cardinals who have dropped eight games in a row. I’m picking Los Angeles.\n\nSunday Football (Afternoon Game) — Washington Commanders at Philadelphia Eagles\n\nThe Eagles will be the second or third seed in the NFC no matter what happens here. They still have the perks of being the NFC East division winners and get to host a playoff game. The rumor is they may rest some starters. Even so, I think they beat Washington who’ve looked terrible for the entire season.\n\nSunday Night Football — Baltimore Ravens at Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nThe Steelers had a chance to make the playoffs and secure the AFC North division title had they beat the Browns last weekend. Unfortunately, they didn’t rise to the occasion and lost to the lowly Browns. That sets up a primetime matchup in Week 18 against the Baltimore Ravens. Baltimore was able to outduel the Green Bay Packers in Week 17. The Ravens are expected to have Lamar Jackson and a few players back for this game. It’ll be a tough go of it on the road, but I think Baltimore is poised to come back and win the division. Pretty impressive given how bad they were earlier in the season.",

    "fullText": "Going into the final week of the regular season, the Denver Broncos (13-3) are tied with the best record in the NFL, and they currently hold the AFC's No. 1 playoff seed.\n\nOverall, the Broncos are a well-balanced team with the NFL's fourth-best scoring defense and the AFC's seventh-best scoring offense. If there's one area where coach Sean Payton's squad is taking, it's takeaways.\n\nDenver ranks 25th in the league with a -5 turnover differential. If the Broncos are going to make a deep run in the NFL playoffs, that number has to improve.\n\n\"The one area that has to improve is the turnover margin, and that can happen,\" Payton said. \"We did a collective of the last 25 years of Super Bowl winners. It’s something like 114 in the plus. There’s been one Super Bowl winner in the last 25 years [in the negative] -- I’m just talking about when the playoffs begin, if that makes sense. When the playoffs begin, the Rams recently were the only minus-two turnover team. The rest added up to some crazy number, and so that’s something we have to improve on.”\n\nDenver has 17 giveaways this season (11 interceptions and six lost fumbles), which ranks 13th-best. A more concerning total is just 12 takeaways (nine interceptions and three fumbles), which ranks fifth-worst in the NFL. In addition to protecting the football, the Broncos need to force more takeaways. If they don't, the odds will be against them as they seek a fourth Super Bowl title.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL: Sean Payton reveals key area Broncos must improve in playoffs",

    "fullText": "CINCINNATI (AP) — Joe Burrow is in unfamiliar territory.\n\nFor the first time in his NFL career, the Cincinnati Bengals quarterback is preparing for a Week 18 start knowing that no matter what, the season ends on Sunday.\n\nBurrow was injured in 2020 and ‘23. The Bengals made it to the Super Bowl in 2021 and the AFC championship game in ’22 along with being in contention for a playoff spot up until the last game in 2024.\n\n“Obviously, you want to win a Super Bowl, you want to win MVPs, you want to be in the playoffs every year,” Burrow said. “My goals at this point are just going out and playing as good as I can and continuing to improve, finding ways to continue to be great and continue to find self improvement.”\n\nThe Bengals (6-10) close out the season on Sunday at home against the Cleveland Browns (4-12). While the Bengals defense has struggled this season, Burrow also missed more than half of the season because of a toe injury that required surgery.\n\nDuring the offseason, as Burrow works to get stronger, the front office will also need to strengthen the roster. Burrow said that he has a great line of communication with the front office and ownership.\n\n“I think my job is to No. 1, play as well as I can. No. 2, continue to improve, and No. 3, be the conduit between coaching staff, front office and the locker room,” Burrow said. “Relay feelings that players have, relay sentiments in the locker room because coaches and front office, they aren’t down there every day and they don’t understand a lot of the things that go on in the locker room. I think (as a) quarterback, your job is to relay some of those things.”\n\nFollowing three years where the Bengals have missed the postseason, Burrow said that there will need to be some changes for the Bengals to get back to contention in the AFC.\n\nBut unlike last season, when he stumped for re-signing players such as Tee Higgins and Mike Gesicki, Burrow is speaking \n\n“We want to be competing for championships every year,” Burrow said. “We don’t want to be in the spot we are in now, so something’s got to change, whether it’s players we have continuing to improve and get better and play championship-caliber football, or bringing in guys that will or whatever it may be.”\n\nRight now, Burrow’s main focus is preparing for a vaunted Browns’ defense and preparing for one of the top pass rushers in Myles Garrett. Burrow has been sacked 11 times by Garrett in nine meetings.\n\nGarrett is one sack away from setting the single-season record for sacks. While that presents a big challenge, the Bengals also have one of their best offensive lines in years. Because of the development of right tackle Amarius Mims and left guard Dylan Fairchild, the Browns will see a much-improved Bengals’ offensive line than what they faced in Week 1.\n\n“I think they’re playing exponentially better than they were at the time,” Burrow said. “I know they’re excited about the challenge, but I know (the Browns’) front is tough to deal with, starting with (Garrett). They have a lot of other guys, too, that can be very challenging to handle up front. I know they’re excited for it.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

It's been a question at the forefront of many fans' minds, thanks to the brutal 0-4, negative 107 point differential, December, the Jets are coming out of.\n\nAccording to Albert Breer of Sports Illustrated, the Jets have a clear plan in place for Glenn beyond the 2025 season. Unfortunately for any fans hoping the Jets cut ties with Glenn, there haven't been any discussions of that nature this season.\n\n\"Here's the reality of the Jets' situation:\" Breer reports, \"There has been no discussion at the upper reaches of the organization about moving on from Aaron Glenn after one year.\"\n\nDespite a rough 2025 season and very little optimism on the roster with so many holes to fill, the Jets organization doesn't plan to cut ties with Glenn after one year.\n\nIn fact, Breer's report suggests that no such conversations have even been happening. Woody Johnson and the Jets organization aren't giving up on Glenn just yet.\n\nMore: Jets expected to make 'significant' roster moves in offseason on defense\n\nEven if the Jets turn in another rough Week 18 showing against the Buffalo Bills, the Jets aren't planning to move on from Glenn after the 2025 season.\n\nJustin Fields was a major miss, and the Jets' front office, led by Darren Mougey, traded away multiple key defenders for a huge return of draft capital.\n\nThis Jets rebuild was never going to be a one-year fix. And it might not even be fixed in 2026 either. The Jets need to be patient, and for now, that looks to be the case in giving Glenn another year at least to figure things out.\n\nBreece Hall makes history despite Jets commanding loss\n\nAaron Glenn questions Jets’ effort after Week 17 blowout to Patriots\n\nWhy Jets benefit from Patriots' Morgan Moses earning $1.5 million incentive\n\nHow Jets' Aaron Glenn can follow Kyle Shanahan, Dan Campbell coaching paths\n\nNFL history doesn't bode well for Aaron Glenn amid Jets' 3-win season",

    "description": "Which 2026 NFL Draft prospects the Detroit Lions should be watching on New Year’s Eve.",
    "fullText": "With the Detroit Lions eliminated from the 2025-26 playoffs, many fans have turned their attention to the offseason—and for many, that means turning their attention to the NFL Draft. Whether you’re just getting into the process or have been studying this draft class all year, the College Football Playoffs are an excellent opportunity to watch several of this year’s top prospects, while also consuming some entertaining football.\n\nOne of the most intriguing games in the College Football Playoff is Miami vs. Ohio State on December 31, 2025, at 7:30 p.m. ET. This game features a plethora of players that should interest the Lions based on projected needs and schematic fits.\n\nSo, let’s take a look at a dozen players Lions’ fans should be paying attention to.\n\nDetroit will enter the offseason looking to add talent to its offensive line, and depending on a few potential retirements, the Lions may need to replace multiple starters or secure future starters, both at tackle and on the interior.\n\nTop prospect: Francis Mauigoa, RT, Miami (6-foot-6, 325)\n\nOne of the most talented and consistent offensive tackle prospects in this draft class, Mauigoa should be a plug-and-play right tackle in the NFL, though it’s also being reported that some teams like him inside at guard as well. The Lions should very much have Mauigoa on their radar in the first round, regardless of how their offensive line shakes out this offseason.\n\nAustin Siereveid, LT, Ohio State (6-foot-5, 325) is a redshirt sophomore who is expected to return to school, but could surprise. With experience at LT, LG, and RG, he’s a talent on the rise.\n\nAnez Cooper, RG, Miami (6-foot-6, 347) is a three-year starter at right guard with the size and power to fit the Lions’ scheme. Likely a Day 3 prospect who could rise with a good offseason.\n\nWhile the best edge player in this game most certainly is Arvell Reese (LB/ED, Ohio State, 6-foot-4, 240), it would be surprising if the Lions were within striking distance to get this hybrid demon. A Micah Parsons/Frankie Luvu/Kyle Van Noy-type of player, Reese would completely change the Lions’ defense if they traded up to acquire him.\n\nMore than likely, the Lions will stick with a more traditional edge player, which leads up to…\n\nTop prospect: Rueben Bain Jr., EDGE, Miami (6-foot-2, 277)\n\nBain has first-round talent, but his body type doesn’t match what NFL teams typically look for on the edge. He is shorter than most and lacks the desired length. However, for the Lions, his body type isn’t too far away from Josh Paschal’s (6-foot-2 1/2, 270) — though Bain’s arms are quite a bit shorter. In addition to his pass rush promise, Bain also has the positional range to move up and down the defensive line.\n\nAkheem Mesidor, EDGE, Miami (6-foot-2 1/2, 273) starts on the opposite edge from Bain but offers a similar skill set and maybe even more positional range. Mesidor is even closer to a Paschal-like clone and could end up making his living in the NFL as a 3-technique.\n\nKenyatta Jackson, Jr., EDGE, Ohio State (6-foot-6, 260) plays a lot of 4i in the Buckeyes’ scheme, which is easily translatable to the current Lions scheme, and why the Lions drafted Tyleik Williams out of Ohio State in the first round last year. Jackson could be an option for the Lions on Day 2.\n\nWith Alex Anzalone on an expiring contract—and coming off a recent contract dispute with the Lions—Detroit may be in the market to find a starting WILL linebacker.\n\nTop prospect: Sonny Styles, LB, Ohio State (6-foot-4, 238)\n\nA freaky athlete that would be a plug-and-play WILL linebacker, but would likely cost the Lions a first-round pick to acquire, but his upside is Jack Campbell-esque.\n\nWesley Bissainthe, LB, Miami (6-foot-2, 226) is a four-year contributor for the Hurricanes with appealing coverage traits. He’s not a complete package for most NFL teams, but there’s enough to get him drafted, and he has the skills to carve out a specialty role at the next level.\n\nThe Lions will enter the offseason with a potential starting slot/nickel role to fill (Amik Robertson is a pending free agent), as well as needing a starting-level safety (or two) to carry the load while Brian Branch and Kerby Joseph recover from injuries.\n\nThe out-of-the-box prospect: Caleb Downs (SAF, Ohio State, 6-foot-0, 205).\n\nOne of the most complete and reliable football players in this draft class, Downs can play two-deep, drop into the box as a rover, play over the slot, rarely misses tackles, and is a dynamic playmaker. There is an argument to be made that Downs is the most talented player in this draft class, but with the NFL not valuing the safety position, he could slide into the Lions’ range. For as much responsibility as the Lions put on their safeties, there’s an argument to be made that they can’t pass up a player with his talents, and when Branch and Joseph return, you live in three-safety sets.\n\nStarting NB: Keionte Scott, DB/NB, Miami (5-foot-11, 195)\n\nEvery year, I tend to fall in love with a defensive back (Devon Witherspoon in 2023, Mike Sainristil in 2024, and Malaki Starks in 2025). This year, Scott is closing in on that title. While he’ll be listed as a corner in most draft guides, I see him as a starting nickel, who is more likely to be cross-trained at safety rather than at outside corner. Aggressive, hits like a linebacker, closes with conviction, and is a more than capable blitzer, Scott is an exciting prospect to watch.\n\nWhile adding to the running back room would be a luxury, I also believe you can’t have enough talented running backs, especially with the way the new special teams rules are designed in the NFL.\n\nSleeper prospect: Mark Fletcher Jr., RB, Miami (6-foot-2, 225)\n\nA bruising downhill runner with experience in multiple blocking schemes, he’s productive both on the ground and in the passing game. If available on Day 3, he’d be a solid complement piece in the Lions running back room, would challenge Jacob Saylors for a reserve power role with the potential to be a David Montgomery replacement a few years down the road.",
