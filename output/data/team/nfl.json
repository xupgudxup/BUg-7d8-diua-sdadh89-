    "description": "A few NFL experts would be fans of the Rams trading for Colts QB Anthony Richardson.",
    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Rams aren't in the market for a new quarterback yet, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't do a little window shopping. Matthew Stafford will be back for another season in 2026, but his future beyond next season is cloudy at best.\n\nWhile L.A. could find its future franchise quarterback in the 2026 draft, there is another avenue they could go down: The trade market. While many names have been touted, two analysts from NFL.com think Anthony Richardson should be a great fit for the Rams.\n\nMarc Ross and Maurice Jones-Drew both pick L.A. as \"ideal landing spots\" for Richardson, who recently requested a trade from the Colts after his third season.\n\nRoss thinks Richardson would be able to learn a lot under Stafford and could turn build his stock back up with Sean McVay as his head coach.\n\n\"Richardson's situation is a Catch-22. He has so little playing experience that he needs to get on the field in order to develop, yet he still is not ready to play at a consistent enough level to produce wins as a starter,\" Ross wrote. \"Thus, a role with the Rams would be an ideal landing spot. He would learn behind reigning MVP Matthew Stafford in the Sean McVay offense, and the only other QB on the current roster is Stetson Bennett, who was drafted 124 spots behind Richardson in the 2023 draft. The hope would be for Richardson to emerge much like this offseason's top quarterback in the free agency market, Malik Willis, who saw drastic improvements under Matt LaFleur (the same offense McVay runs in L.A.).\"\n\nJones-Drew agreed, pointing to other McVay-like coaches who helped reclaim other first-round busts.\n\n\"Sam Darnold went from former first-round bust to Super Bowl champion, and a huge player in that career turnaround was learning from coaches Kyle Shanahan and Kevin O'Connell during stops in San Francisco and Minnesota, respectively,\" Jones-Drew wrote. \"Richardson could be the NFL's next reclamation project if he lands in the right spot after his tumultuous stint in Indy. Learning under Shanahan or Sean McVay in Los Angeles could help Richardson turn his career around and potentially earn another chance to eventually start.\"\n\nRoss and MJD aren't the only analysts who think the Rams are a good fit for Richardson. Robert Griffin III is also a fan of this move. Griffin III called a trade to L.A. \"his Sam Darnold reset year.\"\n\nThere are clear pros and cons to trading for Richardson, and it's unclear if the Rams are even interested in pulling off this move. But, at least in the media, some favor the decision. It would also be a stepping stone to a potential post-Stafford future, unless the Rams have other plans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rams Wire: Rams named as a best fit for Anthony Richardson by 2 analysts",

    "description": "Which corners can separate themselves at the NFL Combine?",
    "fullText": "NFL Combine winners and losers: Live updates on defensive backs, tight ends in Indianapolis originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe only bad news from Day 1 of NFL Combine drills is that Ohio State Buckeyes linebacker Sonny Styles isn't working out for the rest of the weekend. He stole the show on Thursday, setting an exceptionally high bar for the rest of the participants in Indianapolis.\n\nDay 2 of Combine drills will hope to separate the best defensive backs and tight ends from the pack. This class of defensive backs is defined by its biggest stars. Ohio State safety Caleb Downs is a sure-fire first-round pick, but several top cornerbacks sitting out of Friday's drills open the door for movement in the top 50.\n\nThe tight end position is more fluid. Oregon star Kenyon Sadiq is the runaway TE1. While the position is deep, it is far from settled, and strong testing numbers could push under-the-radar names up the board.\n\nWe'll track those winners and losers live as they run, jump, and drill their way to April.\n\nWinner: D'Angelo Ponds, CB, Indiana\n\nI was ready to write Ponds off as a loser, having measured in at the extremely small 5085 and 182 pounds. It's an outlier in the wrong direction, but I don't want to double-count it. Everyone knew he was among the shortest players in this class.\n\nIndiana CB D'Angelo Ponds just jumped a 43.50\" vertical😳pic.twitter.com/jO08foXmJV\n\n— PFF College (@PFF_College) February 27, 2026\n\nWhat we didn't know was that he was going to hit 43.5 inches in the vertical jump, the sixth-best mark from a corner since 1999, per MockDraftable's database. That kind of explosion is necessary to buy breathing room, adding margin for error that his frame steals from him. He needs to move exceptionally well to keep his stock in the right spot -- jumping out of the building is an exceptional way to start.\n\nWinner: Tacario Davis, CB, Washington\n\nFrequently, prototypical Cover 3 corners use their length to mitigate speed concerns. They might not have the quickest feet, but size can keep receivers at bay, too.\n\nDavis checked off both boxes, exceeding many expectations. At 6037, he's a pterodactyl, and the rest of his frame falls in line. A 97th-percentile wingspan and 95th-percentile arm length will have position coaches tripping over themselves until April.\n\nHe also ran well, posting an unofficial 4.41-second 40-yard dash. That's an excellent time for anyone, much less one who has some coverage questions to answer at the next level. If nothing else, his physical tools will boost his stock.\n\nIt's not a winner and losers column without the latter, but that isn't fair to TJ Hall. He wasn't expected to run his way up boards on the Indianapolis fast track. He did, however, run slower than every other corner at the event.\n\nWithout overwhelming size, Hall's lack of speed makes him a zone corner with mid-Day 3 aspirations. Fortunately, he moved well during the first batch of position drills -- he's not in free fall.\n\nWinner: Toriano Pride Jr., CB, Missouri\n\nThe other side of that coin, of course, is the fastest player at one's position. Pride put himself on the map with two blazing runs, the best of which came in at 4.32 seconds.\n\nMORE: NFL Combine 40-yard dash tracker\n\nPride is undersized at 5'10\", 185, but he isn't an outlier in terms of length. He showed off his burst during position drills, too. Speed of Pride's ilk doesn't hide, but showing out on this kind of stage is nice ammo in his argument to be a Day 3 pick.\n\nLoser: Emmanuel McNeil-Warren, SAF, Toledo\n\nA surprising underperformer on Friday was Emmanuel McNeil-Warren, who spent much of the process as a Day 2 pick before the recent wind of first-round rumors spread. Since the Super Bowl, the bar has been set for McNeil-Warren's Combine performance -- Seattle Seahawks rookie Nick Emmanwori.\n\nMcNeil-Warren, at 6034, 201, is slimmer than Emmanwori. His arms are slightly smaller, and his testing numbers look like they are going to fall pretty far behind. Seattle's star posted a 98th-percentile vertical jump and 99th-percentile broad jump. The Toledo safety had marks of 35.5 inches and 10'2\", far more pedestrian. In fact, 11 safeties had better vertical jumps in Indianapolis.\n\nHis first 40-yard dash clocked in at 4.55, albeit with what looked like a slow start. The sequel wasn't much better -- 4.53 seconds. Perhaps the Emmanwori hype was unfair, but this was a letdown, and it might push him back into Day 2.\n\nWinner: Lorenzo Styles Jr., SAF, Ohio State\n\nOhio State is taking over the NFL Combine. Thursday, Sonny Styles and Arvell Reese were headliners. On Friday, the other Styles brother was even faster, laying claim to the fastest man at the 2026 NFL Combine (at least for now).\n\nTwo 4.28-second runs are a \"call the family\" performance. Styles made himself money on the fast track and had the football world waiting on his second run. He delivered!\n\nWinner: Genesis Smith, SAF, Arizona\n\nThere's an argument to be made that no safety moved better than Smith on Friday. One of the class's only true free safeties, he showed the kind of dynamism necessary to take on that role at the next level.\n\nSmith had the best vertical jump (42.5 inches) of the group, the eighth-best mark for a safety since 1999. He's explosiveness personified, and it showed in his position drills, too. He was smooth, twitchy, and fast, making little of his 40-yard dash absence.\n\nSmith is a Day 2 centerfielder, a point he proved at the Combine.\n\nWinner: Dillon Thieneman, SAF, Oregon\n\nThere weren't any questions about whether Thieneman was fast heading into the Combine. The Oregon standout has plenty of explosiveness in his game, giving him range as a centerfielder and the burst to click-and-close underneath.\n\nThere's a difference between running a 4.45 40-yard dash and a 4.35 40-yard dash, though. His 41-inch vertical jump was the second-best mark among safeties. The 10'5\" broad jump was less imposing, but there was enough to hang his hat on for a positive day. Throw in position drills that saw Thieneman show off fluidity and footwork, and there was certainly a lot to like.\n\nIt wouldn't be all that surprising if Thieneman's testing puts him further into the Round 1 conversation, especially if others lose ground.\n\nWinner: Eli Stowers, TE, Vanderbilt\n\nWe have history in Indianapolis. No tight end in the history of the MockDraftable database (since 1999) has cleared 43.5 inches. Oregon's Kenyon Sadiq hit that mark. Moments later, Stowers beat it. By two full inches.\n\nWith a 45.5-inch vertical, it might not matter what Stowers runs. That short-area explosiveness defines his game and makes him one of the twitchiest athletes in his class. He's slot-bound, sure, but we learned with Evan Engram that being a tight end in name only is still a path to production in the NFL.\n\nIn the race for TE2, Stowers just took a massive leap.\n\nOh, and he also set the Combine record for a tight end broad jump (11'3\") before posting a 4.51-second 40-yard dash. Nice day at the office!\n\nSonny Styles scouting report: Ohio State LB could test into top five\n\nNFL Combine winners and losers from Day 1\n\nFive measurements to look forward to at the NFL Combine\n\nWhy is Jordyn Tyson skipping NFL Combine workouts?",

    "description": "The NFL's 2026 salary cap is expected to be $301 million, a $22 million increase. See how this affects the Baltimore Ravens' free agency plans",
    "fullText": "The Ravens have a ballpark number on a potential salary cap after teams were notified on Friday that the expected salary cap range for the 2025 season would be $301 million per team.\n\nThe NFL's new year is a little over 13 days away, with the league's free agency tampering period set to begin on March 9. Last February, the NFL announced a record-breaking salary cap of $279.2 million for the 2025 season, a significant increase from the 2024 cap of $255.4 million.\n\nThe cap will now rise by $22 million for all 32 NFL teams.\n\nWith an official announcement complete, here's how the salary cap number will impact the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nThe salary cap is the total amount of money a team can spend on its players. It is calculated based on the league-wide revenue generated from TV deals, ticket sales, merchandise, etc.\n\nThe salary cap has increased by over $48 million over the last two years. In 2024, it was $255.4 million for each team, and in 2025, it was $279 million.\n\nJesse Minter is the Ravens new head coach, and he's surrounded quarterback Lamar Jackson with a dynamic young playcaller in Declan Doyle. Baltimore has 22 unrestricted free agents, according to Over The Cap, with big names like Tyler Linderbaum, Isaiah Likely, Kyle Van Noy, Dre'Mont Jones, Alohi Gilman, Chidobe Awuzie, and Ar'Darius Washington among those Eric DeCosta will evaluate.\n\nDeCosta has ways to clear salary-cap space, such as extending Lamar Jackson or restructuring Jackson and Roquan Smith, and Baltimore could look to make a big move or target a top-tier name interested in joining the league's top coaching staff.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ravens Wire: NFL salary cap 2026: How $301M impacts Baltimore Ravens",

    "description": "The 2026 NFL salary cap figure is set. How much space do the Jacksonville Jaguars have?",
    "fullText": "The NFL announced the 2026 salary cap figure for the Jacksonville Jaguars and the 31 other teams.\n\nA month ago, it was reported that the 2026 salary cap would be in the $301.2 million to $305.7 million range. According to Ian Rapoport, the official cap number will be set at $301.2 million.\n\nThis is up $22 million from the 2024 season and up nearly $100 million from 2022, when the cap figure was $208.2 million.\n\nSo what does this mean for the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2026?\n\nNFL clubs were informed today that the salary cap for the ’26 season will jump $22 million per club to $301.2 million. Add in another $77.6m in benefits & that’s $378.8m per club in player spending. Tremendous growth pic.twitter.com/cQ5Zf3aGVW\n\n— Brian McCarthy (@NFLprguy) February 27, 2026\n\nBefore this news broke, Over the Cap projected that the Jaguars were $13.48 million over the 2026 salary cap. That was based on a salary cap figure of $303.5 million.\n\nWith the official number now known, we can estimate that the Jaguars are roughly $15.78 million over this year's cap.\n\nSo GM James Gladstone has some work to do in the coming weeks before free agency officially opens on March 11th.\n\nSalary cap space can be created through contract restructures, which pushes a portion of the current year's cap charges to future years, inflating the salary cap hits at that time.\n\nA contract extension in some instances can create space as well, as can veteran cuts, if the player's cap hit is larger than their dead cap hit.\n\nThe Jaguars actually have the ability to create quite a bit more space, as we detailed here, it just depends on how aggressive Gladstone wants to be.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jaguars Wire: 2026 NFL salary cap: How much space do Jacksonville Jaguars have?",

    "fullText": "Every spring, the NFL Scouting Combine becomes football’s most revealing evaluation stage, where measurable performance can elevate prospects from promising college standouts to coveted professional investments. Yet the athletes who arrive prepared to excel there rarely emerge by chance; they are shaped within programs that consistently transform elite recruitment into disciplined, pro-ready execution.\n\nOver decades of draft cycles, a select group of universities has distinguished itself by sending extraordinary numbers of players to this national proving ground. Programs like the Alabama Crimson Tide, Ohio State Buckeyes, LSU Tigers, Georgia Bulldogs, Florida Gators, USC Trojans, Oklahoma Sooners, Miami Hurricanes, Michigan Wolverines, and Notre Dame Fighting Irish have built reputations not merely for winning games, but for producing athletes equipped for professional scrutiny. Their sustained presence reflects deep recruiting networks, sophisticated strength development, and coaching philosophies aligned with modern professional schemes.\n\nPlayers trained in these environments face weekly competition that mirrors the speed, complexity, and physical demands they will encounter at football’s highest level. As a result, combine invitations become more than individual achievements; they serve as recurring evidence of institutional systems that reliably convert potential into measurable performance. Examining which programs dominate participation offers insight into where player development is most systematic, most demanding, and most closely aligned with the expectations of professional football.\n\nThese ten programs illustrate how sustained excellence emerges when infrastructure, culture, and competition operate in harmony, ensuring that year after year new prospects arrive prepared to meet professional benchmarks with confidence, discipline, and measurable distinction across every position. Here are the number of athletes invited from each college.\n\nAlabama’s player development machine has been one of the most consistent talent pipelines in modern college football. Year after year, elite recruiting classes are molded into pro-ready athletes who arrive at the combine polished and physically dominant. The program’s culture of competition ensures even backups often develop into legitimate NFL prospects.\n\nOhio State blends blue-chip recruiting with a pro-style development structure that translates cleanly to the NFL stage. Their athletes frequently test among the most explosive and technically refined at the combine. The program’s depth means multiple position groups consistently send waves of prospects each year.\n\nLSU’s reputation for producing NFL-caliber talent is rooted in its physical style of play and emphasis on individual skill development. Defensive backs, receivers, and defensive linemen in particular have become signature exports. The Tigers’ ability to develop raw athleticism into elite performance metrics shows up clearly in combine testing.\n\nGeorgia’s recent dominance has coincided with a surge in combine invitations, especially from its historically deep defense. The program emphasizes speed, strength, and scheme discipline that mirrors professional systems. Their roster depth ensures that even rotational players often project as high-ceiling prospects.\n\nFlorida’s long tradition of athletic, fast-paced football has produced a steady stream of combine invitees across multiple eras. Skill-position explosiveness and defensive versatility are recurring hallmarks of Gator prospects. Even through coaching transitions, the program’s recruiting footprint has kept NFL interest high.\n\nUSC’s legacy as a West Coast powerhouse has long translated into strong NFL representation. The program consistently attracts elite skill talent, particularly at quarterback, receiver, and defensive back. When the Trojans are nationally competitive, their combine presence typically surges alongside it.\n\nOklahoma’s offensive innovation has produced some of the most technically advanced and productive prospects in college football. Quarterbacks and offensive playmakers often arrive at the combine with extensive high-level game experience. The program’s ability to showcase talent in high-scoring systems boosts visibility for NFL evaluators.\n\nMiami’s historic identity is built on speed, swagger, and defensive playmaking — traits that translate well to combine testing. The program’s peak eras established a reputation for producing physically intimidating and explosive athletes. Even during rebuilding periods, the Hurricanes’ talent pipeline remains nationally respected.\n\nMichigan’s balanced roster construction and physical style produce prospects known for discipline and technical soundness. Linemen and defensive players in particular often arrive well-developed in strength and fundamentals. The program’s recent resurgence has reinforced its standing as a dependable NFL feeder.\n\nNotre Dame combines national recruiting reach with a reputation for developing fundamentally sound, high-character players. Offensive linemen, tight ends, and defensive front players frequently emerge as combine standouts. The program’s emphasis on preparation and consistency helps prospects transition smoothly to pro evaluation settings.\n\nUltimately, the programs that dominate combine invitations represent more than tradition or recruiting reach — they reflect sustained excellence in development. Producing one NFL prospect is impressive; producing waves of them year after year defines institutional identity. As long as these schools continue to pair elite talent with elite preparation, their presence at football’s premier evaluation stage will remain not just expected, but inevitable.\n\nOLYMPICS: Final 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings\n\nNFL: 4 blockbuster NFL trades we want to see before the 2026 draft\n\nNFL DRAFT: 2026 NFL Scouting Combine day-to-day TV schedule, how to watch\n\nMLB: MLB Power Rankings as 2026 Spring Training begins\n\nNBA: Updated NBA Power Rankings as a new week begins\n\nVIRAL: Watch Johnny Gaudreau’s children join Team USA hockey gold medal celebration\n\nThe post Top 10 colleges with most NFL combine invites appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Ohio State linebacker Sonny Styles is to his position what Seattle Seahawks safety Nick Emmanwori is to his.\n\nBefore we cover the top players the Seattle Seahawks might take in the 2026 NFL Draft, let’s talk about one that can continue to push modern defense into the futuristic mold Mike Macdonald changed the NFL with- who will certainly be going far too high for the Super Bowl LX Champions to have any chance at.\n\nStyles is setting the NFL Scouting Combine on fire today. He just recorded the best vertical jump ever for a linebacker at 43.5” inches and the 4th-best broad jump ever at 11’2”. Watch the all-time explosiveness right here:\n\n.@OhioStateFB LB Sonny Styles putting up insane numbers already:\n- 11'2\" broad jump (T-4th all-time among LBs)\n- 43.5\" vertical jump (best all-time among LBs)\n\n2026 NFL Combine on @nflnetwork\nStream on @NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/3Nshgb2Dyb\n\nIf you’ve followed our coverage of Emmanwori over the past season, you might know that we constantly reference his combine testing numbers. He announced himself to the world one year ago at this event with the best measurables ever seen by a safety since testing began in 1987. The Seahawks traded up to draft him and he was a game changer for their defense, allowing them to defend both the pass and run in ways other teams simply couldn’t. He has as bright a future as arguably any defensive player in the league right now. The only reason he fell to the 35th pick was because of the idea that “he doesn’t play a premium position”.\n\nStyles can reinvent linebacker in the same way. He won’t fall in this draft, where he’s a consensus top 3-5 player, despite the same ideas about positional value. Whoever drafts him will also know that he’s more than just a linebacker. He played safety for his first two-years of college in 2022 and 2023, and was only moved to linebacker right before the 2024 season. To have started his career as a safety with this frame, though, is downright scary.\n\nSonny Styles \n6050\n244\n10 hand\n32 7/8 arm\n80 7/8 wing\n\n— Daniel Jeremiah (@MoveTheSticks) February 26, 2026\n\nWhen Styles’ full testing numbers come out later tonight, don’t be surprised if people start calling him the best player in the draft. Since I started writing this article, the Emmanwori comps are already flowing in. The linebackers are running the 40-yard dash now, and if Styles does as well as he’s projected, the hype will continue to flood the discourse even more.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: NFL Combine: Sonny Styles is the Nick Emmanwori of linebackers",

    "fullText": "Biggest NFL Combine takeaways from Day 1 of draft workouts originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NFL fans alike gather in person or around a television to witness something unique to football. Football is not the only sport that conducts a “Combine” to put incoming rookies through interviews, drills, medical evaluations and mental tests. However, it is the only sport where the “Combine” has become must-see TV.\n\nAlso known as the National Invitational Camp (NIC), the combine like everything else has a history. The four day football evaluation did not begin as the television event it is now. Just like the images of the NFL Draft decades ago, the combine used to be a small affair. Before 1976, the combine did not exist.\n\nIn the pre-1970s, NFL teams rarely conducted any sort of physical assessment of potential incoming college players. During that same period, the NFL Draft was also 17 rounds. Not the seven rounds it is today.\n\nThe first implementation any sort of physical assessment was actually started by the New York Jets who in 1976 invited prospects to their headquarters to be interviewed and tested.\n\n“Besides character and intelligence, the other non-football thing we put a premium on is the medical aspect,” Mike Hickey, the Jets’ director of player personnel, wrote in a column for The New York Times in April 1983. “We attempt to have every player we are interested in have an orthopedic physical by our team physicians.”\n\nThe early days of what would eventually become the Scouting Combine were just a series of visits. The opposite of pro day visits we have now. Instead of all the scouts and front office personnel travelling to Florida’s pro day or USC’s pro day, the prospects would travel to the respective NFL cities to be tested.\n\nThe process was complicated and expensive. In the early 1980s, Dallas Cowboys general manager Tex Schramm recommended to the NFL’s competition committee that teams should work together to “centralize the evaluation process”.\n\nThe first Combine took place in 1982 in Tampa, Florida. That first Combine included 16 teams and 163 players. The number of invitees has doubled over time to around 300 over the last decade plus.\n\nMore:2026 NFL combine: Full list of draft prospects\n\nInitially there were three groups of camps. The Indianapolis-based National Football Scouting Inc (NFS), BLESTO and Quadra Scouting. In 1985, all three camps were merged to save on operating costs. The central location in 1985 was Phoenix, Arizona. The central location for 1986 was New Orleans, Louisiana, however, in 1987 the venue was moved to Indianapolis where it has remained ever since.\n\nOver time more and more aspects were added to the process. Just like the old NFL Drafts consisted of a closed-door operation not open to the fans, so was the Combine. As the Combine itself evolved, so did the public’s interest in it.\n\nMore:How the NFL Scouting Combine got its name: Schedule, history and origins of the biggest NFL Draft event\n\nThe first ever televised NFL Scouting Combine didn’t occur until 22 years after its inaugural event in 1982. In 2004 the then new NFL Network aired six one-hour end of the day recaps on the events of the Combine. In 2005, those one hour recaps became two hour recaps. In 2006 and 2007 the Combine coverage grew to over 25 hours of television coverage.\n\nIn the 2020s, the Combine is viewed as the second largest and most important event in the pre-draft process. Second only to the NFL Draft itself. Today, the combine evaluations are critical to the work NFL teams do on these prospects. Game tape will always be No. 1, but right behind the in game evaluations is the NFL Scouting Combine.\n\nDefensive Ends begin their workout, starting with the 40 times. Defensive End is a 'traits' position. They will naturally run better 40 times that almost all of the Defensive Tackles. In large part to a completely different body type as well as technique.\n\nVincent Anthony Jr - DE - Duke: 1st attempt: 4.85 / 2nd attempt: 4.85\n\nDavid Bailey - DE - Texas Tech: 1st attempt: 4.51 / 2nd attempt: 4.54\n\nBailey checked speed off his to-do list. Bailey's time is the seventh fastest 40 time by a Defensive End in Combine history. The all time record belongs to Amare Barno (4.36). Bailey was not satisfied with his time.\n\nJaishawn Barham - DE - Michigan: 1st attempt: 4.65 / 2nd attempt: 4.66\n\nBarham pulled up and grabbed his hamstring in the last 5 yards of the 40 and still came within 0.01 of his uninjured time.\n\nDani Dennis-Scott - DE - Penn State: 1st attempt: 4.51 / 2nd attempt: 4.65\n\nGeorge Gumbs Jr - DE - Florida: 1st attempt: 4.70 / 2nd attempt: 4.66\n\nRomello Height - DE - Texas Tech: 1st attempt: 4.64 / 2nd attempt: 4.65\n\nCashius Howell - DE - Texas A&M: 1st attempt: 4.60 / 2nd attempt: 4.60\n\nQuintayvious Hutchins - DE - Boston College: 1st attempt: 4.74 / 2nd attempt:\n\nMarvin Jones Jr - DE - Oklahoma: 1st attempt: 4.74 / 2nd attempt:\n\nNyjalik Kelly - DE - UCF: 1st attempt: 4.91 / 2nd attempt:\n\nMalachi Lawrence - DE - UCF: 1st attempt: 4.53 / 2nd attempt:\n\nMax Llewellyn - DE - Iowa: 1st attempt: 4.85 / 2nd attempt:\n\nTrey Moore - DE - Texas: 1st attempt: 4.55 / 2nd attempt:\n\nLT Overton - DE - Alabama: 1st attempt: 4.91 / 2nd attempt:\n\nTJ Parker - DE - Clemson: 1st attempt: 4.68 / 2nd attempt:\n\nMason Reiger - DE - Wisconsin: 1st attempt: 4.79 / 2nd attempt:\n\nR Mason Thomas - DE - Oklahoma: 1st attempt: 4.67 / 2nd attempt:\n\nNadame Tucker - DE - W. Michigan: 1st attempt: 4.74 / 2nd attempt:\n\nWesley Willaims - DE - Duke: 1st attempt: 4.90 / 2nd attempt:\n\nStacey Dales reporting: Miami DE Rueben Bain confirmed he will not run the 40 at the Combine.\n\n\"If they do the draft based on personality, we're looking at a Top 5 pick right there.\"\n\nEveryone in Indy is loving them some Lee Hunter.\n\n📺 #NFLCombine on @NFLNetworkpic.twitter.com/1cuC7882rD\n\n— Texas Tech Football (@TexasTechFB) February 26, 2026\n\nBroad Jump - Albert Regis: 9'8\"\n\nVertical Jump - Gracen Halton: 36.50\"\n\n20-yard shuttle - Jackie Marshall: 4.68 seconds\n\n10-yard split - Zane Durant: 1.66 seconds\n\nPlayers line up in their stance, the administrator of the drill pulls on the football on s stick, the player surges forward. The ball on a stick then indicates whether the player cuts right or left, bends around the corresponding cone and sprints ten yards downfield in a straight line.\n\nVery few players participated in this drill and those that competed all looked similar. Some bend a little wider, but all completed the drill with no directional or completion issues.\n\nIt's football on a stick time. This drill includes two large hula hoop like circles on the ground. Players will run a figure eight while picking up two bound towels and relocating them to the opposite side of the circle. This measures a players' 'bend'.\n\nIn addition to how they bend, towel placement is important. Players are expected to precisely place the towel. Taking it from three o'clock and moving it to nine o'clock on the respective hoops.\n\nGary Smith III of UCLA struggled with the towel placement, including one rep the had the second towel outside the hoop and at almost seven o'clock. Darrell Jackson Jr of Florida State also struggled somewhat. He is a large human. Fluidity and bend may not be his biggest strength.\n\nThe darling of this group Zane Durant did not participate in the Run the Hoop Drill. However, grading who did well and who did not followed suit with the Pass Rush Drill. Both grade smoothness and tightness in similar ways.\n\nThe school with the most prospects in Indy is @AggieFootball.\n\nTheir head coach Mike Elko stopped by the booth to chat with @MoveTheSticks and @RichEisen!\n\n2026 NFL Combine on NFL Network\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/cSH85fnhY2\n\n— NFL Network (@nflnetwork) February 26, 2026\n\nThe Run and Club Drill is more intended for what Defensive Tackles typically do. Attempting to shed or get around blocks within a confined space. The club is the easy part. The spin will have varied degrees of fluidity. The tricky part is the final turn and flattening.\n\nMost of the prospects struggled with the spin move aspect. Most lack the instinctive plant foot. Resulting in what looks like moving around the bag instead of spinning around the bag. The chop and rip aspect just before they need to flatten also gave some players issues.\n\nEach of these interior linemen move through this drill with speed and power. What separates the prospects is the ability to execute these moves in a phone booth. The wider the move the less impressive. Zane Durant, again, was by far the best competitor in this drill.\n\nAlso referred to as the 'Swim' drill. Players will drive off the line, hit the first bag, then run forward and swim the next bag, then a sprint to the finish. As it is a pass rushing drill, these will look less impressive than when we see the actual pass rushers doing this drill.\n\nThe following will be relayed as almost pass/fail. Interior defensive lineman typically will work the drill similarly. It will either look good, or it won't.\n\nNick Barrett, Rayshaun Benny, Zane Durant, Deven Eastern, Gracen Halton, Lee Hunter, Darrell Jackson Jr, Tim Keenan III, Jackie Marshall, Chris McClellan, Kayden McDonald, Tyler Onyedim, Albert Regis, Damonic Williams,\n\nCameron Ball, DeMonte Capeheart, Bobby Jamison-Travis, Kaleb Proctor, Gary Smith III,\n\nZane Durant was clearly the class of the group for the Pass Rush Drill. While Rayshaun Benny, Lee Hunter, and Chris McClellan were are better than the rest, Durant stood head and shoulders above the rest. There is real athleticism, not positional athleticism with Durant. He could create real creativity from a defensive coordinator with his agility and balance from the defensive tackle position.\n\n\"They call it the four bag agility drill because there are four bags on the ground\" Rich Eisen said. This drill is usually done with much more fluidity and smoothness when done by pass rushers, but it does measure agility and change of direction.\n\nRayshaun Benny of Michigan was the first defensive tackle to make this drill look smooth. Some minimal bag movement, but otherwise very smooth and fast.\n\nZane Durant followed Benny and made it looks easy. Kept his eyes down through most of it, which is not recommended, but very smooth. \"He's so athletic\" Jeremiah said after his attempt.\n\nBryson Eason had another smooth run of this drill. Perhaps not going all out speed wise, but enough that it didn't seem he was worried about the changes.\n\nDeven Eastern might be the first participant to do the drill at his top speed. Legs under him, no glaring mistakes, at full speed.\n\nGracen Halton had a really solid run. Fast with high knees, no bag infractions. Really solid.\n\nLee Hunter showed some stiffness in his hips, but made this drill look much better than the Wave Drill.\n\nTim Keenan III had an interesting run through the bags. Lateral movement looked much better than average but struggled in forwards and backwards transitions.\n\nKayden McDonald looked much better in the bad agility drill. No stumbles, close to full speed, lateral movement was good and he kept his feet under him.\n\nThe Wave Drill forces players to display lateral quickness and recovery speed. Most tackles will perform this similarly due to the nature of the position. When someone excels in this drill it pops off the screen.\n\nCaleb Banks anticipated the changes well, but lacks an explosiveness that shows up on screen.\n\nNick Barrett had an almost stumble early but saved it. Less controlled than Banks, but the results were better.\n\nFollowing Capeheart's 40 times, his Wave Drill was similar. Awkward movements but unquestioned results. Not smooth but fast and his cuts didn't slow him down.\n\nGusta and Halton both had stumbles after the first change of direction.\n\nLee Hunter was a bit choppy but remained in control, no slipping and no guessing the change. Very solid, just not fast.\n\nJackie Marshall didn't stumble and didn't miss at any point. However, he was yelled at throughout the drill to open it up. As if he was moving a little slower to better anticipate the changes.\n\nKayden McDonald fell on the first move clear to the turf. They cancelled his run and he'll get another change to try the first attempt again. His second attempt was better but not by much. No falls, but he did appear to be pacing himself (which teams don't love in this drill) and seemed to be confused on the direction queues.\n\nTyler Onyedim looked really good. One of the ones that pops off the screen. Completely under control, feet under him, adamant moves, good spring out of the cuts.\n\nIan Rapoport reporting: Tennessee Titans agree to trade DT T'Vondre Sweat to the Jets for DE Jermaine Johnson.\n\nAlbert Regis - DT - Texas A&M: 1st attempt: 4.92 / 2nd attempt: 4.88\n\nRegis had the best 'looking' start (1.73 split) of the tackles thus far. The first tackle to not have the drag foot start. High knees and driving through the line.\n\nGood start, not as good as the first one. Form got a little wide in the first ten, but he cleaned it up and improved on his already good time.\n\nKaleb Proctor - DT - SE Lousiana: 1st attempt: 4.80 / 2nd attempt: 4.84\n\nClean start (1.69 split), very fluid gate. Runs smoother than hard. Giving a very solid first 40 time.\n\nThe form lost a little something on the back end. Still a good time, he'll stick with the first 4.80 time.\n\nChris McClellan - DT - College: 1st attempt: 5.05 / 2nd attempt: 5.08\n\nA very clunky start (1.80 split), but recovered down the stretch make up some of that time. Comes out of his form early, but the drive/kick makes up for it.\n\nFirst step was faster but still had a drag foot on the second step. Really pushed through yards 10-20.\n\nJackie Marshall - DT - Baylor: 1st attempt: 4.88 / 2nd attempt: 4.92\n\nReally nice run. Good start (1.69 split) fluid throughout. Despite the smoothness, strong steps led to a very nice time. Shaving almost a tenth off the expectation.\n\nTim Keenan III - DT - Alabama: 1st attempt: 5.32 / 2nd attempt: 5.31\n\nKeenan is another larger DT. Another less than explosive start (1.84 split) but he recovered nicely with a steady but strong gate.\n\nGood start again. He looked to be ahead of his own pace at the midway point, but began to slow in the last ten yards. Giving him a slightly longer time.\n\nLee Hunter - DT - Texas Tech: 1st attempt: 5.25 / 2nd attempt: 5.18\n\nThe first attempt will seem like a bad number, but Hunter is a large man. 6'4, 325. The 1.82 10-yard split is a little underwhelming; lacks a first step explosion you want to see.\n\nHunter made a significant improvement. Similar slower split but he drove hard down the stretch. Improving the time by seven one hundredths.\n\nGracen Halton - DT - Oklahoma: 1st attempt: 4.83 / 2nd attempt: 4.86\n\nFaulted on the first start. Strange kick down the stretch, but it works. Halton gives a very good sub 4.9 time.\n\nLess than ideal start but with that same strange kick down the stretch. The start hurt this time as the back end was almost the same.\n\nDavid Gusta - DT - Kentucky: 1st attempt: 4.88 / 2nd attempt: 4.90\n\nReally solid first run. Good start, steps get more aggressive with each passing yard. Very solid at 4.88.\n\nThe second attempt was a very different run. Same good but not explosive start, but this time with a pronounced wide stride.\n\nBryson Eason - DT - Tennessee: 1st attempt: 5.12 / 2nd attempt: 5.09\n\nEason has a relatively fluid movement for a man his size. In control and steady. At 6'3, 315 that was a solid run. Could be big for Eason if he can get under 5.10.\n\nSame controlled, steady run except this time he cleaned up the start and improved his time. Getting under the 5.10 mark as previously predicted. 5.09 on the second attempt.\n\nZane Durant - DT - Penn State: 1st attempt: 4.76 / 2nd attempt: 4.77\n\nDurant comes in with an explosive expectation. Another angry runner. \"We weren't expecting turbulence, but we were expecting a fast 40 time. Both require a seat belt\" Daniel Jeremiah said on the broadcast.\n\nDurant delivers another impressive sub 4.8 time. Almost a carbon copy form wise. Good start and he drives with every step.\n\nBrandon Cleveland - DT - NC State: 1st attempt: 5.11 / 2nd attempt: 5.22\n\nCleveland maintains decent upper body form and didn't come out of his crouch until the finish line. Solid measured movement, in control.\n\nCleveland looked to have a good start, but something happened in the middle third. Appeared to be a hamstring pull, but he fought through it and didn't fully pull up until after the finish line. Eisen and Jeremiah could be heard audibly reacting with saying \"oh great\" at almost the same time.\n\nDeMonte Capeheart - DT - Clemson: 1st attempt: 4.85 / 2nd attempt: 4.86\n\nCapeheart is the first of this batch of 40 times to really move. Capeheart had a similar first start to Barrett, but Capeheart fully recovered in before the 10-yard mark and was really churning. Runs like he's angry at the ground.\n\nCapeheart has a way of running, but it works. Same angry, hard steps. Once he gets up to speed it looks awkward, but he's moving.\n\nNick Barrett - DT - South Carolina: 1st attempt: 5.11 / 2nd attempt: 5.11\n\nBarrett had a less than clean start on the first attempt but recovered after his second step. The time was not great at 5.11, but if he can clean up the start, he can shave a few hundredths off that time.\n\nBarrett 2nd attempt was exactly the same as the first. In time and form. Start was better, first step was much better, but lost a little something towards the end of the run. \"I think he's a 5.11 runner...\" Rich Eisen said as he crossed the finish line.\n\nCaleb Banks - DT - Florida: 1st attempt: 5.05 / 2nd attempt: 5.13\n\nBanks false faulted on the first two starts of the first attempt. On the third start, Banks ran a respectable time for his size. He looked like a large DT running a 40, but form remained constant.\n\nBanks struggled through his second run adding almost a full tenth to his time. Seemed to lose form and had labored steps in the final third.\n\nCameron Ball - DT - Arkansas: 1st attempt: 5.11 / 2nd attempt: 5.13\n\nBall's first attempt was mildly concerning. Clean start, however, his form broke down just after the 10-yard split and struggled to regain it until about the 30-yard mark. Could improve on the second attempt.\n\nSecond run was not better, but still acceptable. Clean start but slow in the first five. Came out of his form a little early.\n\nFinal Defensive Tackle 40-time leaders: Zane Durant - 4.75, Kaleb Proctor - 4.80, Gracen Halton - 4.82, DeMonte Capeheart - 4.85, David Gusta - 4.88\n\nStacey Dales reporting: 6'3, 335 Florida DT Caleb Banks will perform today despite a broken foot suffered in September. He will be a full participant. Ohio State DT Kayden McDonald will not run the 40 but is expected to participate in the bag drills to show his explosiveness.\n\nRich Eisen and Daniel Jeremiah have begun the broadcast from the NFL Network perch. First up will be defensive tackles. This group has some big names, a few could even crack the first round. Jeremiah has Lee as his No. 1 DT in the class. With Kayden McDonald, Caleb Banks, Peter Woods, and Christen Miller making up the top 5. All with the exception of Hunter have something to prove during this Combine.\n\n2026 NFL Scouting Combine: Defensive players with the most to prove\n\nA few guys to be on the lookout for in Group 1. @MoveTheSticks\n\n2026 NFL Combine on @nflnetwork\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/pDiKbmbXm4\n\n2026 NFL Scouting Combine Schedule\n\nPosition groups split up over the next four days in Indy 🏈\n\n2026 NFL Combine starts Thursday 3pm ET on @nflnetwork\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/XK47clg2Za\n\nRemembering a viral Joe Burrow Combine tweet:\n\nWhen Joe Burrow joked about retiring after getting his hand measurements at the NFL combine 😂🤚 pic.twitter.com/T1F5FytNxa\n\n— Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) February 26, 2026\n\nCombine News: According to the New York Post, Eagles General Manager has reversed his position on keeping WR AJ Brown.\n\n2026 NFL scouting combine rankings: Quarterbacks\n\n2026 NFL scouting combine rankings: Running backs\n\n2026 NFL scouting combine rankings: Offensive line\n\n2026 NFL scouting combine rankings: Wide receivers\n\n2026 NFL scouting combine rankings: Tight ends\n\n2026 NFL scouting combine: Defensive players with the most to prove\n\nLive stream: Fubo (free trial), NFL+\n\nThe NFL Combine can be live streamed wioth Fubo, which offers a free trial.

    "fullText": "MetLife Stadium got an F- grade from players in the ‘home game field’ category of the NFL Players Association 2026 report cards, an annual survey grading franchises from A+ to F- in a variety of categories.\n\nThe New York Giants as an organization finished 25th overall. The Miami Dolphins were No. 1, and the Pittsburgh Steelers were last among the league’s 32 franchises.\n\nThe 2026 survey was the fourth annual. The first three were made public on the NFLPA website. The NFLPA did not post the results this year due to a grievance filed by the league. Nonetheless, ESPN obtained the report card results.\n\nTreatment of Families: B-\nHome Game Field: F-\nFood/Dining Area: B+\nNutritionist/Dietician: A-\nLocker Room: D\nTraining Room: B-\nTraining Staff: B+\nWeight Room: B\nStrength Coaches: B+\nPosition Coaches: B\nOffensive Coordinator: C+\nDefensive Coordinator: D+\nSpecial Teams Coordinator: B+\nTeam Travel: C\nHead Coach: C\nGeneral Manager: D+\nTeam Ownership: B\n\nHere are some thoughts on a few of the categories.\n\nThe turf at MetLife Stadium has long been a source of consternation among players.

I also wonder if part of the grade is a reaction to an ugly, lifeless building that has played host to two of the worst teams in the NFL for most of the past several years.\n\nJoe Schoen of the Giants got, by far, the worst grade of any general manager in the league.\n\nA : Dan Morgan, George Paton, Chris Ballard, Les Snead, Kwesi Adofo-Mensah, John Schneider, Adam Peters\n\nA-: Eric DeCosta, Brandon Beane, Ryan Poles, Brad Holmes, Nick Caserio, James Gladstone, John Spytek, Chris Grier, Darren Mougey, John Lynch, Jason Licht\n\nB+: Terry Fontenot, Brian Gutekunst, Brett Veach, Joe Hortiz, Eliot Wolf, Mike Borgonzi\n\nB: Monti Ossenfort, Jerry Jones, Mickey Loomis, Howie Roseman\n\nWell, of course that players are tired of losing and don’t like Schoen’s product. I think, though, the grade also reflects unhappiness with how Schoen deals with players in negotiations, resulting in a possible lack of trust. It might be a part of the reason why Dawn Aponte was hired and could end up doing a lot of the team’s contract negotiating.\n\nWhatever the reason, it isn’t a good look for Schoen. Whether he wants to admit it or not, he has lost power in the organization, is fortunate to still have his job, and is in a battle to keep it.\n\nIt has been clear for a few years now that the Giants’ once state of the art locker room had become cramped and outdated. The organization is renovating the locker room space this offseason, and I would expect that grade to go up in 2027. The dining area has also been undergoing renovation.\n\nYeah, nobody misses Shane Bowen.\n\nI thought Mike Kafka would have fared better here after his stint as interim head coach.\n\nPlayers liked Brian Daboll well enough as a person. Daboll just lost the magic touch he had in 2022, and there weren’t any signs of it coming back.\n\nJohn Harbaugh: B\nMatt Nagy: C+\nDennard Wilson: B-\nChris Horton: B+\nGreg Roman: D-",

    "description": "Derek Carr retired from the NFL last season after experiencing lingering shoulder pain from a labral tear. According to NFL […]",
    "fullText": "Derek Carr retired from the NFL last season after experiencing lingering shoulder pain from a labral tear. According to NFL insider Jordan Schultz, there’s a “strong belief” Carr is “very serious” about unretiring after a full year away from football.\n\nStill under contract with the New Orleans Saints, teams would have to trade for Carr rather than simply be allowed to sign him outright. Though, there’s a possibility New Orleans decides to release Carr the moment he unretires to avoid a $36 million cap charge for 2026, the final year of his contract.\n\nIn any event, Carr wants to play football again, and there are plenty of QB-needy teams who could be eager to give him a look. Below, we evaluate six teams that could consider adding Carr this offseason.\n\nNow led by two-time Coach of the Year Kevin Stefanski, the Falcons still have 2024 first-round pick Michael Penix Jr. atop the depth chart. But he hasn’t proven himself as a bona fide franchise quarterback just yet. The Falcons may view the opportunity to add Carr as a way to raise the floor of the QB room while having him compete with Penix.\n\nAnother team set to move on from its franchise quarterback, the Cardinals will likely bring Jacoby Brissett back after a strong season. But there’s no guarantee a new coaching staff will get the same results, which could lead to Arizona capitalizing on Brissett’s newfound value. Meanwhile, a team that features one of the NFL’s best tight ends in Trey McBride, plus another potential superstar receiver in Marvin Harrison Jr., may see the value in bringing in another veteran who could immediately lead a winning effort.\n\nThe new-look Browns coaching staff appears intrigued by both Shedeur Sanders and Deshaun Watson. Dillon Gabriel is the other QB in Cleveland, but we wouldn’t imagine the Browns are ready to give up on the 2025 third-round pick. Yet, they also don’t have their franchise QB yet, so adding another arm like Carr this offseason is certainly possible.\n\nThere’s no telling what the Jets do this offseason, but there’s a lot of pressure on second-year head coach Aaron Glenn to get some wins after a woeful 3-14 debut season. Plus, 64-year-old offensive coordinator Frank Reich didn’t sign on just to lose a bunch of games. In other words, it shouldn’t surprise anyone if the Jets look for a veteran who can get some wins right away, and Carr fits the bill.\n\nLike the Cardinals, who are expected to move on from Kyler Murray, the Dolphins are likely done with Tua Tagovailoa. So, who will they get to replace him? Miami will be operating on a strict budget once they move on from Tagovailoa, who’s guaranteed over $50 million in 2025. Meanwhile, Carr hasn’t played in a full year and only made it through 10 games in 2024. In other words, he wouldn’t break the bank. Carr will need to prove he’s healthy and capable of playing at a high level first.\n\nThe Vikings’ QB room is extremely young. So, when they do add a QB this offseason, expect it to be a veteran who may not be a long-term solution. That’s where the 11-year-veteran Carr could be a perfect fit, not only serving as a bridge starter, but also by buying more time to evaluate J.J. McCarthy while he fine-tunes his footwork and accuracy. The four-time Pro Bowl QB could not only be a potential high-level starter in Minnesota, but he will also be able to help coach up McCarthy, too.\n\nArizona Cardinals Pro Bowler Wants To Be Cut From Team\n\nChicago Bears Receiving Trade Offers for Multiple Players\n\nMinnesota Vikings Share ‘Mutual Interest’ with Former First-Round QB",

    "fullText": "Packers General Manager Brian Gutekunst faces several challenging decisions in the 2026 offseason. Most notably, Gutekunst must find a way to create salary cap space to fully participate in offseason activities. The Packers are currently $1.5 million over the 2026 NFL salary cap.\n\nFree agency and the 2026 NFL draft are looming. Green Bay must enter these periods armed with ample cap space to fully capitalize. The Packers’ front office will need to make some challenging decisions to create that space. As a result, several notable veterans may find themselves searching for a new home.\n\nThe Packers’ offensive line managed several injuries over the course of the 2025 season. Young players stepped up and adequately filled the gaps created by veteran absences. Green Bay can take advantage of those successes by moving on from some established veterans on the offensive line.\n\nAaron Banks and Elgton Jenkins both rank within the top five cap hits for the Packers’ 2026 season. Banks ranked 69th of 81 qualifying guards in 2025, and Jenkins missed 10 games due to injury in his age 30 season. The Packers’ investment in these players has not been met with the necessary production to maintain the relationship.\n\nThe Packers could save nearly $20 million in cap space this offseason by moving on from Elgton Jenkins\n\nThe 2x Pro Bowler is 30 years old with an injury history and had contract disputes during last training camp.\n\nHard to imagine he stays on the team under his current contract. pic.twitter.com/VJBui9hF8c\n\n— SleeperPackers (@SleeperPackers) February 17, 2026\n\nRashan Gary represents another possible cap casualty for the Packers. Following a disappointing close to the 2025 season, Gary’s $28 million cap hit in 2026 is hard to justify.\n\nRemoving unfavorable contracts is a popular way to reduce salary cap strain. Another way is by extending contracts of existing players to move money around. Safety Xavier McKinney is just 27 years old and is one of the most effective players on the Packers’ roster.\n\nMcKinney only has two years remaining in his contract and has a cap hit of $19 million or \n\nThe Packers have options to create cap space. Any option that keeps good players in Green Bay should be celebrated.\n\nThe Packers finished with 3 players on PFF's Top 101 players of 2025 list: Xavier McKinney, Jordan Love and Micah Parsons. https://t.co/WTTEowC2uV pic.twitter.com/7qL2BSWJsD\n\n— The Packers Wire (@ThePackersWire) February 20, 2026\n\nThe post How Can the Packers Create Much-Needed Cap Space? appeared first on The Lead.",

    "fullText": "NFL Combine winners and losers: Live updates on defensive linemen, linebackers in Indianapolis originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NFL Scouting Combine is underway, and after four days of arrivals, interviews, exams, and meetings, the fun has finally begun.\n\nIt's time to watch the athletic testing and positional drills that skyrocket stocks, starting with the defensive linemen and linebackers. Defensive backs and tight ends will perform on Friday, with running backs, receivers, and quarterbacks headlining Saturday's festivities and offensive linemen rounding out the weekend.\n\nFor all the turbulence at other positions, the 2026 NFL Draft is strong in the front seven. Several edge rushers stand to be top-five picks come April. It's a preternaturally deep linebacker class, and the interior linemen will have starters drafted into Day 3. Perhaps more than any position, it's important to focus on size. Weight and arm length thresholds are king in the trenches, and many top prospects are fighting against historical precedents on their way to Round 1.\n\nAs these prospects vie for draft capital, we'll keep track of the most important performances of the day.\n\nWinner: Caleb Banks, DT, Florida\n\nAt 6062 and 327 pounds, Banks is every bit as big as we thought he was. The rest of his frame was even more impressive, posting 94th-percentile hand size, 94th-percentile arm length, and a 99th-percentile wingspan (via Trevor Sikkema).\n\nBanks is a freak, and ripping off a 5.05 40-yard dash on his first attempt is further proof that he is a different beast than us mere mortals. Banks fought through injuries this season, but if his 61st-percentile 40-yard dash is confirmed, it will be hard to keep that kind of upside out of Round 1.\n\nHis second run went for 5.13 seconds, but with 10-yard splits of 1.76 and 1.77 seconds, he's a comfortable winner early on Thursday.\n\nLoser: Cashius Howell, EDGE, Texas A&M\n\nHowell wasn't surprising anyone with his lack of length. But coming in with 30.25-inch arms is confirmation that he's a negative outlier and bound to hurt his stock. No edge rusher in MockDraftable's database (NFL Combine participants since 1999) has that kind of limitation -- by a half-inch.\n\nThat's a problem anyway one cuts it, and weighing in at 253 pounds (totally fine!) may not be able to compensate. He might need standout 40-yard dash and three-cone times to limit his fall, and even an optimistic view of his athletic profile is more about damage control than potential.\n\nHowell's film is promising. However, his arm length demands that coaches ask how they can mitigate his biggest weakness. Fair or not, that makes him more difficult to take in the top 50.\n\nWinner: Sonny Styles, LB, Ohio State\n\nHe hasn't run yet, but merely being measured has made Styles a winner of the week. At 6'5\", 244 pounds, he has more than enough muscle to make plays in the box. His 71st-percentile arm length stands out on film.\n\nMORE: NFL Combine measurements tracker 2026: Hand size, height, weight and more for Fernando Mendoza, other notables\n\nRemember, this is a former safety. His transition to linebacker went smoothly, and he eradicated his tackling concerns in his platform season. Styles has strong instincts and special movement skills, and in Indianapolis, he proved that he doesn't have to sacrifice physicality in the process.\n\nI expect him to bring the house down when it's time for the 40.\n\nUPDATE: He just posted a 43.5-inch vertical jump. That's the second-best mark for a linebacker since Cameron Wake in 2005 -- a full inch more than the next-best contender. We're shaping up to witness a truly incredible Combine performance.\n\nHe followed that up with a 4.46-second 40-yard dash, the fastest at the position. This was the best Combine a linebacker has had in years, and it might make him the best off-ball prospect since Roquan Smith in 2018.\n\nLoser: Peter Woods, DT, Clemson\n\nWoods entered the season as my top player and an easy selection for DT1. I'll remain higher than consensus, but the calculus has grown increasingly difficult. His 2025 campaign wasn't as impressive as his show-stopping 2024 film, and his pre-draft process hasn't gotten off to a roaring start.\n\nWoods weighed in at 298 pounds, lighter than anticipated and a signal that he might be shedding weight to shed time on his 40-yard dash. Then he didn't run.\n\nLikewise, Woods' arm length came in at 31.25 inches, a fourth-percentile mark for interior linemen. It's not the end of the world, given his ability to shed blocks and find solutions with athleticism. Still, it's an extra point of caution, and he didn't put his athletic prowess on paper.\n\nWinner: Kaleb Proctor, DT, Southeastern Louisiana\n\nProctor wasn't on my radar entering the event. That hasn't stopped him from leaving a mark on Day 1 of drills. Proctor ran a 4.79 40-yard dash with a promising 10-yard split.\n\nThroughout his athletic testing and positional drills, he looked like an easy mover. That bodes well for him to be a Day 3 selection as a rotational pass rusher, having turned his burst into nine sacks this season. Color me intrigued, especially if his 291-pound frame holds up on early downs.\n\nWinner: Malachi Lawrence, EDGE, Central Florida\n\nLawrence put himself on the map in Indianapolis. At 6'4\" and 253 pounds, Lawrence isn't quite as small as the class's most burst-dependent edge rushers. Still, he put on a show, setting the tone with a 40-inch vertical jump and 10'10\" broad jump.\n\n.@UCF_Football EDGE Malachi Lawrence:\n\n- 6'4\", 253 pounds\n- 40\" vertical jump\n- 10'10\" broad jump\n\n2026 NFL Combine on @nflnetwork\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/MopTX0d9eX\n\nHe didn't stop there. His first run was 4.53 seconds, trailing only David Bailey (4.51) at edge rusher (for first attempts). He'll have upward momentum during the pre-draft circuit, especially if he continues to move well during positional drills.\n\nLoser: LT Overton, EDGE, Alabama\n\nOne player who didn't move all that well was Alabama's LT Overton. It's important not to double-count these Combine drills for guys that test as expected.\n\nHowever, Overton was a bit slimmer than anticipated at 274 pounds. Even so, his 4.91 40-yard dash was tied for the slowest mark on the edge. It's hard to see Overton making a living as a sack artist at the next level; his run defense is his calling card. If he doesn't have the size to pull that off, Overton may lack the juice to be a starter on Sundays.\n\nFortunately, he moved a little better during positional drills to mitigate concerns.\n\nWinner: David Bailey, EDGE, Texas Tech\n\nBailey didn't test like a generational freak, but he was still able to run a 4.51 40-yard dash to lead the position. He's doing his part to put minor movement concerns to rest, and the rest of his athletic markers were promising.\n\nHis 1.62 10-yard split was impressive, and his 35-inch vert and 10'9\" broad jump help insulate his profile. He also came in a little bigger than some expected, crossing the 250-pound threshold with 33.75-inch arms. This event was more about solidifying his stock than improving it. Bailey checked the necessary boxes to be a top-15 pick.\n\nWinner: TJ Parker, EDGE, Clemson\n\nParker was a prospect that fared unfavorably on my preseason board. The top-five hype was always rich, but as an early Day 2 selection, he has room to make some noise at the next level.\n\nPart of that equation is Parker's ability to convert speed to power. Running a 4.68 40-yard dash at 263 pounds is impressive and an indictment of his best pass-rushing trait. With the size to stick on early downs and fun flashes as a pass rusher, sneaking into Round 1 is possible, even if his stock tumbled with Clemson's playoff aspirations.\n\nLoser: R Mason Thomas, EDGE, Oklahoma\n\nR Mason Thomas talked a big game about his speed making up for perceived physical deficiencies. At 241 pounds, Thomas needs truly elite burst to compensate. Being a dynamic edge rusher has staying power on early downs if the ability to wreak havoc outweighs concerns against the run.\n\nInstead, Thomas slipped on his first run on the way to a 4.67 time. On his second opportunity, he was even slower, logging a 4.72-second 40-yard dash. It's a legitimately concerning mark that makes a strong Pro Day performance necessary. A bad day in Indianapolis doesn't have to kill his stock, but it means his work is cut out for him.\n\nLoser: Rueben Bain Jr., EDGE, Miami\n\nI'm not convinced this stint will impact his draft stock; the teams that like Bains will like him regardless of arm length. He's a nuanced pass rusher who solves problems to overcome his length issues, and he has a proven track record of producing and rising in big games.\n\nYet, Bain measured in at 263 pounds. That helps inform us that he intends to play outside full-time at the next level, rather than splitting time along the interior because of his lack of length. And reader, the length is indeed lacking. At 30 7/8\", he's operating as an outlier, prompting damage-control tweets and an extended look at his profile.\n\nIt would have been nice if Bain showed off his elite movement skills by testing or doing positional drills. We'll have to wait for his pro day, raising the stakes for an impressive performance.\n\nWinner: Gracen Halton, DT, Oklahoma\n\nThere's a growing need for pass-rushing defensive tackles, and Halton entered the Combine as a rotational asset with passing-down upside. He made a strong argument to be a Day 2 pick on Thursday with an elite showing.\n\nHalton posted the third-best vertical jump (36.5 inches) for defensive tackles since 1999, and he was also the third-quickest lineman at 4.82 seconds. More than just a burst-first tackle, Halton showed off a well-rounded athletic profile that included a handful of exciting positional drills.\n\nKyle Louis faced a familiar challenge for undersized linebackers -- ensuring his athleticism carved out a role on passing downs. It's safe to say he locked that down in Indianapolis.\n\nLouis had the fourth-best vertical (39.5 inches) and second-best broad (10'9\") jumps at the linebacker position. He won't outshine Styles, but backed by a 4.54-second 40-yard dash, there's more than enough dynamism in his profile.\n\nWinner: Arvell Reese, LB, Ohio State\n\nTesting as a linebacker, Reese needed to quiet the (few) contracting voices about his athleticism, largely based on the idea that he needs to be an elite athlete if he's going to transition to edge rusher full-time.\n\nOn Thursday, he showed off the same burst that quarterbacks saw when they were trying to scramble against Ohio State's defense. He posted a 4.46 unofficial 40-yard dash, meeting the moment. We'll see how he looks in positional drills, but it was a strong, if underrated, performance.\n\nLoser: Justin Jefferson, LB, Alabama\n\nIt would be hyperbolic to suggest that Jefferson had a bad set of drills. He posted a 4.57-second 40-yard dash, a 38.5-inch vertical, and a 10'5\" broad jump -- totally respectable times.\n\nHowever, athleticism was Jefferson's calling card at Alabama. Daniel Jeremiah even added on the broadcast that he could compete with the other Justin Jefferson on the 40-yard track, as he was among the fastest players on the field for Crimson Tide game days.\n\nInstead, Jefferson slightly fell short of expectations, generating good, but not great, athleticism scores and losing ground in what looks like an exceptionally athletic (and deep) crop of linebackers.\n\nWhy is Jordyn Tyson skipping NFL Combine workouts?\n\nFive measurements to look forward to at the NFL Combine\n\nTop snubs from the 2026 NFL Combine\n\nFive best fits for Ohio State safety Caleb Downs",

And there's an emerging trend that one new head coach believes will soon be copied.\n\nBrowns coach Todd Monken has a prediction: There will be more downfield laterals.\n\n\"I do think that laterals are going to be a bigger part of our game,\" Monken said during a Wednesday appearance on PFT Live. \"I believe that you get these zone looks. Now, you've got to throw it to the guy you trust, because you don't want that damn thing on the ground. But I do think that is going to become more and \n\nMonken believes it won't be something that happens only in specific situations.\n\n\"Not just on third downs, not just on fourth down, not just as a gimmick play,\" Monken said. \"Obviously, Ben [Johnson] started doing that a lot in Detroit. Give credit where credit's due. And then others have started to do that a little bit more. And it takes some stones to do it. If the ball ends up on the ground, you're gonna get critiqued for it, but I can see the game going that way, where plays have built-in laterals. It just feels like it can go that way.\"\n\nIt's an effective way to counter a defense's pursuit of the ball and, if/when the defense is bracing for it, to get the defense a little wobbly and uncertain.\n\nStill, as Monken said, execution will be critical. A bad lateral potentially becomes a lost possession, followed by public and private questions as to the sanity of the coach who called the play.",

    "fullText": "Day 1 of on-the-field workouts at the 2026 NFL Combine saw Zane Durant and Dani Dennis-Sutton go through their auditions, and it’s safe to say it was a strong one for both players.\n\nDurant was up first with the interior defensive linemen, and he showed off with an impressive 33.5-inch vertical (tied for third best for DTs) and an official 4.75 forty time at a confirmed 290 pounds.\n\nBuckle up.@PennStateFball DT Zane Durant sprinted for a 4.76u \n\n2026 NFL Combine on @nflnetwork\nStream on @NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/IrpOEJnHji\n\nThe 4.75 forty time for was the best time for a defensive tackle in the 2026 class, and it comes in as tied for the 4th best time by a DT since 2013. Only Adetomiwa Adebawore (4.49 — 4th round pick, 2023), Calijah Kancey (4.67 — 1st round pick, 2023), and Aaron Donald (4.69 — ugh you know him, 2014) had better forty times for interior defensive lineman prospects. All those guys were listed in the 280s — Adebawore 282, Kancey 281, and Donald 285 — where as Durant was 290 flat.\n\nDoes that mean Durant will go in the first round like Donald or Kancey? Not likely, at all. Durant was good at Penn State, especially as a junior, but his production was not on par with either of those Pitt guys. Kancey had 14.5 sacks and 27.5 TFLs his last two seasons in college, and Donald had 16.5 sacks and 47 (!!!!) TFLs his last two. Comparatively, Durant had just 7 sacks and 15.5 TFLs. And sure, the Big Ten in 2024 and 2025 was steeper competition than the Big East and ACC were back then, but that’s a big gap in raw production. Still, this was an overwhelmingly good day for Durant, who probably puts himself more squarely in the 4th round area and maybe could even sneak into the 3rd round.\n\nAs for DDS, it was a banner day. As you can see from the Dane Brugler tweet below, but DDS was one of the big winners from the defensive end group.\n\nDani Dennis-Sutton had a really nice day:\n\n4.63 40\n1.63 10\n39.5 vert\n10'11\" broad jump\n6.90 3-cone (!!)\n\n6-6, 256 pounds, 33 1/2\" arms, 10 1/8\" hands\n\n— Dane Brugler (@dpbrugler) February 27, 2026\n\nHis 40 time was 6th for a defensive end. His vertical was 4th. His broad jump was 1st. His 3-cone was first. And he did it at a shade under 6’6 and coming in at 256 pounds — which is a little on the lighter side for DDS, but it’s around the 260-ish he usually plays us.\n\nDDS was pretty squarely in the Day 2 (rounds 2-3) mix heading into today, and I think he cemented his floor as a Day 2 guy and might have opened up the possibility to sneak into the first round. He has great size, confirmed elite athletic ability, and solid production totaling 17 sacks and 25 TFLs the last two years.",

    "fullText": "It took a while, but Day 1 of NFL Combine workouts in Indianapolis got fun by the end. In particular, one position group more than any other looks like one the Bears should definitely dip into, and it might not be the one you think.\n\n1. I’m good on Kayden McDonald at No. 25.\n\nOne should never put too much stock into the Underwear Olympics when it comes to moving players up or down in the Combine. In the end, your resume is the tape.\n\nThat said, I feel like McDonald’s on-field workout revealed something he himself has hinted at in interviews with reporters: he’s more of a pure run-stopping 3-4 nose tackle than a 4-3 tackle at either the 1- or 3-technique.\n\nWhile he has the short-area quickness and strength you want inside, you can almost see the lack of versatility in his game when you watch him move. He simply doesn’t have the juice to consistently rush the passer, which you can see in his production (three total sacks in college). There’s something to be said for being REALLY good at your role, and McDonald certainly is that when it comes to stopping the run.\n\nBut if the Bears are still in the market for a defensive tackle at No. 25, I’d look at Lee Hunter over McDonald. Hunter’s the more complete player of the two, and is one of the few guys in this class you cannot single-block either in the run game or the pass game. If you do, he inevitably wins.\n\nI might even suggest waiting until the second round and look for guys like Christen Miller (Georgia) or Dontay Corleone (Cincinnati) if the value seems right.\n\nMcDonald will likely be solid at what he does in the NFL, especially in a system that fits his skills. I’m just not sure that system belongs to the Bears.\n\n2. T.J. Parker is not making it to the Bears.\n\nThroughout the week, I’ve heard from draft experts and scouts that the Clemson product was going to go earlier than Bears fans would want him to, despite some mocks and big boards suggesting he might be an option at No. 25. After the workout he just put together in Indianapolis, you can kiss any dreams of that goodbye.\n\nT.J. Parker is a DE prospect in the 2026 draft class. He scored an unofficial 9.33 RAS out of a possible 10.00. This ranked 138 out of 2046 DE from 1987 to 2026.\n\nSplits projected, all times unofficial, agilities left to run, bench tomorrow.https://t.co/v7lww9nouW pic.twitter.com/5LTupv1Slq\n\n— RAS.football (@MathBomb) February 26, 2026\n\nWe knew he was strong and had the baseline frame Dennis Allen might want a 4-3 defensive end. His speed (4.68 seconds in the 40) tore the track up, and his solid 34-inch vertical affirmed his explosiveness at 6-3.5, 263 pounds.\n\nAgain, though, these numbers only confirm what he’s already shown on tape, as he ranked 56th in total pressures last year among 853 qualified edge rushers. After that first set of edge rushers—Arvell Reese, David Bailey, and Rueben Bain Jr.—come off the board, Parker will likely be next.\n\nIf I were the Bears, I’d be looking for later options at edge and looking to bolster that position a different way. Because guys like Zion Young and Cashius Howell, who ran well but simply isn’t long or twitchy enough to be in play, aren’t likely to be the best players available at No. 25.\n\n3. The Bears will dip into this linebacker class.\n\nIt seems like the linebackers just get faster every year. Not a single one of these guys ran a 4.7s 40 or worse, and three players—Reese, Sonny Styles, and Kaleb Elarms-Orr—ran under 4.5. Obviously, the Bears will have no shot at taking those first two guys, who likely both will go in the top 10. But expect the Bears to do a lot of homework on this group after the day they collectively put together.\n\nAfter all, Chicago’s linebacker position is only slightly less problematic than the safety position this year due to impending losses—Tremaine Edmunds will be cut, Amen Ogbongbemiga has been cut, T.J. Edwards and Noah Sewell are injured and face long recoveries, Ruben Hyppolite II barely played, and DeMarco Jackson is a free agent/has made four career starts.\n\nExpect the Bears to sign some more veteran talent at linebacker to steady the ship and grab another linebacker either late on Day 2 or early on Day 3. They suffered too much from decimation at this position not to invest in it this year.",

They also, per Oscar Delp, scheduled a meeting to speak with the former Georgia Bulldogs star, too.\n\nEndries brings a well-rounded profile. He has dependable hands while being a polished route runner. He has the versatility to align both in-line and flex outside to make plays in space.\n\nDuring his tenure at Texas, despite not always being a focal point of the offensive attack, he was a reliable chain-mover, one capable of working the middle of the field and finding soft spots in zone coverage to settle into.\n\nAs far as Philadelphia is concerned, what stands out is the consistency of its approach across interviewees. No one expected them to lock in on one marquee name, and they haven't. They're building a comprehensive draft board. board, meeting with multiple prospects, and gathering information.\n\nThat's how sustainable roster construction works. Layer future options behind current starters before urgency forces a move. It's far too early to connect firm draft dots, but with each reported NFL Combine interview, Philadelphia is revealing its priorities.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: NFL Combine: Eagles met with Texas Longhorns TE Jack Endries",

    "fullText": "An intriguing quarterback is reportedly available for the Pittsburgh Steelers to pursue this offseason.\n\nThe Indianapolis Colts granted Anthony Richardson permission to seek a trade, per ESPN’s Stephen Holder. NFL Network’s Cameron Wolfe said the player and team “mutually agreed” that exploring a move would benefit both parties.\n\nThree years ago, the Colts invested the No. 4 overall pick on Richardson despite modest college results. He completed just 53.8 percent of his passes for the Florida Gators in 2022 but dazzled scouts with his off-the-charts athleticism.\n\nA shoulder injury ended Richardson’s rookie season in Week 5, and head coach Shane Steichen benched the young signal-caller early in his 2024 return. Daniel Jones won the starting job over Richardson last summer and led the Colts to an 8-2 start before they lost seven straight games.\n\nRichardson was out with an eye injury when Jones suffered a season-ending Achilles tear in Week 14. That led the Colts to bring the 44-year-old Philip Rivers out of retirement after four years away from the NFL.\n\nJones is a free agent, but the Colts don’t appear open to turning the offense back to Richardson next season. He’s completed 177 of 350 passes for 2,400 yards, 11 touchdowns, 11 interceptions and a dismal 67.8 quarterback rating over his career.\n\nEarly struggles aside, Richardson remains an intriguing high-upside gamble for a quarterback-needy organization such as the Steelers. The 23-year-old brandishes a strong arm and immense running prowess, tallying 10 rushing touchdowns over his first two seasons.\n\nWhether or not Aaron Rodgers returns, Richardson could warrant a look for Pittsburgh as a potential long-term option that’s eluded the franchise in recent years.\n\nMore NFL: Steelers GM Addresses Aaron Rodgers Saga, Quarterback Uncertainty\n\nThe post Potential Steelers Quarterback Target Receives Permission To Seek Trade appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "title": "Las Vegas Raiders 3-4 Defense: Edge Rushers to Watch at 2026 NFL Combine in Indianapolis",
    "description": "Raider Nation has sat through scheme changes before — every new coaching staff brings a new identity, a new buzzword, […]",
    "fullText": "Raider Nation has sat through scheme changes before — every new coaching staff brings a new identity, a new buzzword, a new set of promises. Most of them didn’t mean much. This one is different, and I mean that in a very specific way.\n\nKlint Kubiak stood at a podium at the NFL Combine on Wednesday and confirmed what many people had been speculating about since Rob Leonard was hired as defensive coordinator. The Raiders are moving to a 3-4 base defense. Done. Official. It changes everything about how you evaluate this roster, how you approach free agency, and most importantly for this week, how you watch edge rushers at the combine.\n\nHere’s why that matters right now.\n\nIn a 3-4, your edge rushers aren’t just pass rushers. They’re outside linebackers who have to set the edge against the run, drop into coverage occasionally, and still get after the quarterback. It’s a different job description. Maxx Crosby can do all of it, and he’s one of the few players in the league who genuinely can. But the guy lined up opposite him? That room is empty right now. Leonard needs a bookend. The combine this week is where that search starts in earnest.\n\nHere are five edge rushers you should watch this week at the NFL Combine and read up on before the NFL Draft.\n\nBain is the most physically imposing pass rusher in this class and it isn’t particularly close. Thick, powerful, plays with leverage and violent hands, and recorded 9.5 sacks and 15.5 tackles for loss for a Miami team that went to the national championship game. The knock on him — and scouts are talking about it this week — is arm length. Short arms on a 3-4 outside linebacker can cause problems at the point of attack against NFL tackles. Watch how he measures on Thursday when the official numbers come out. If the arms are fine, he’s a top-five pick and gone before Las Vegas sniffs him. If the numbers raise questions, there’s a scenario where he falls just enough. In a 3-4 scheme that asks its edge guys to be more than just designated pass rushers, Bain’s run defense is actually a selling point. He sets an edge better than anyone in this class.\n\nTop prospect Rueben Bain Jr. says teams not \"too concerned\" with arm lengthhttps://t.co/KO3AOuvEoO pic.twitter.com/4m53GFbnwA\n\n— Around The NFL (@AroundTheNFL) February 25, 2026\n\nThe pure speed-to-power combination Bailey brings is the best in the draft. Fourteen and a half sacks, 19.5 tackles for loss last season. His first step is almost unfair — he’s off the ball before tackles have processed the snap. The question scouts are asking isn’t whether he can rush the passer. Obviously, he can. It’s whether he’s a three-down player in a scheme that demands it. A 3-4 outside linebacker in Leonard’s system, which blends Brian Flores and Mike Macdonald influences, needs to be reliable against the run before he becomes a pass rush weapon. Watch Bailey in the one-on-one drills and pay close attention to how he uses his hands. Power rushers who can bend and redirect tend to translate better to the 3-4. Bailey might be that guy.\n\nTwenty-five sacks and 33 tackles for loss over the last three seasons. That’s not a misprint. Howell doesn’t get the same attention as Bain and Bailey because he doesn’t fit the prototype (he’s not as big, not as long), but the production is undeniable and the bend around the corner is legitimate. In a 3-4, a smaller but explosive outside linebacker who can rush from a two-point stance is genuinely valuable. Macdonald’s defenses in Baltimore regularly used that type of player. Watch his 40 and explosion numbers. If he runs faster than expected, there will be teams moving him up boards quickly. The Raiders’ brass knows this scheme. They’ll know exactly what to look for with Howell.\n\nParker had a rough 2025. Clemson’s defense as a whole struggled, and his numbers dipped from his outstanding 2024 season. Eleven sacks and six forced fumbles in 2024 tell you what the ceiling looks like. The power in his game is real. He stacks and sheds better than anyone in this class, sets a hard edge against the run, and his hand usage is advanced. For a 3-4 scheme that asks outside linebackers to be stout on early downs before rushing on third, Parker profiles well. The combine is his chance to remind people what his 2024 tape looked like. Watch the hand drills and one-on-ones. Power rushers show themselves there.\n\nTJ Parker is a MONSTER!!! 🐯\n\nParker at Clemson (3 Seasons):\n– 127 Total Tackles\n– 21.5 Sacks 🤯\n– 6 Forced Fumbles\n\nParker is a GAME CHANGER in the 2026 Draft pic.twitter.com/yCXgQ7l5rl\n\n— SleeperCFB (@SleeperCFB) February 25, 2026\n\nDaniel Jeremiah has Reese ranked third overall in the entire draft class. Third. Not third among edge rushers — third overall. Ohio State used him all over the field, off the ball at linebacker, on the edge as a rusher, as a spy. That versatility is exactly what Leonard’s hybrid 3-4 is going to demand. He’s fluid, explosive, and plays with an instinctiveness you can’t coach. The challenge is projection. Because he did so many things in Columbus, there are real questions about what his NFL role looks like. The combine interviews and position workouts this week will go a long way toward answering that. If teams come away convinced he can be a true edge in a 3-4, he might not make it out of the top five. Watch him closely in every drill, not just the pass rush ones.\n\nThe 3-4 announcement changes the entire calculus for how we evaluate this Raiders draft class. It’s not just about finding guys who can rush the passer anymore. Leonard needs athletes who can play the run, hold up at the point of attack, and still be a nightmare for quarterbacks on third down. This week in Indianapolis at the NFL Combine, that search is officially underway.",

    "fullText": "NFL Draft prospects have descended upon Indianapolis for the NFL Scouting Combine, where they have a chance to meet with prospective teams and work out in front of front office, coaches and scouts before April's draft.\n\nThe Chicago Bears, who hold the 25th overall pick, will likely be drafting a defensive player in the first round, and the belief is they could shore up the defensive trenches, where edge rusher and defensive tackle are both big needs.\n\nGeneral manager Ryan Poles admitted that the edge rusher group is deeper than defensive tackle, an indication Chicago could look to select an interior lineman first. One of the top defensive tackles in this year's class, Clemson's Peter Woods spoke to the media on Wednesday and said that he feels he's a Top-10 pick in this year's class, naming several teams, including the Bears, that he feels he fits in with.\n\n\"It's going to be a blessing to get drafted by anybody,\" Woods said, via Josina Anderson. \"One thing about Chicago is I think back to my days of playing Madden, you have a dream to play for any team in the NFL. I played Madden with Jay Cutler and some of those Bears legends, that could go for any team, but it'll be a blessing to be drafted by any team in the National Football League, or the Chicago Bears, or any team that picks me.\"\n\nWoods had an outstanding 2024 season that catapulted him to the top of draft boards, but had a bit of a setback in 2025, with 30 tackles and two sacks for the Tigers. But he's still projected to be one of the top players selected at his position. Teams continue to emphasize talent and depth in the trenches, so while Woods believes he's a Top-10 pick, he's going to have competition as the first interior defender taken off the board in this year's draft.\n\nFollow Bears Wire on Twitter, Facebookand Instagram\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bears Wire: NFL draft prospect Peter Woods has long memories of Chicago Bears",

    "fullText": "The future of Kirk Cousins in the NFL has taken a definitive turn. After weeks of speculation and contract drama, multiple reports confirm that the Atlanta Falcons plan to release Cousins when free agency begins on March 11, 2026, making him one of the most intriguing quarterback names on the open market. Cousins, 37, signed a lucrative four-year, $180 million contract with Atlanta in 2024 with the expectation he’d be the franchise’s long-term starter. But injuries, inconsistent play, and the rise of younger quarterback Michael Penix Jr. altered that narrative sharply.\n\nThe Falcons’ new general manager, Ian Cunningham, confirmed that the team will officially release Cousins on the first day of the new league year, March 11, providing clarity well ahead of free agency’s kickoff. The decision reportedly came out of mutual understanding: Atlanta gains salary cap flexibility while Cousins gets the opportunity to choose his next destination.\n\nMORE: 4 blockbuster NFL trades we want to see before the 2026 draft\n\nCousins’ career has been one of durability and solid production, with numerous Pro Bowl nods and consistent passing stats over 14 NFL seasons. But his time in Atlanta failed to live up to expectations. Despite moments of effectiveness, including leading the team to a 5-3 record in games he started in 2025, turnovers and injuries hindered his ability to maintain the starter’s job long-term.\n\nNow entering free agency, Cousins will have several options — though the landscape for veteran quarterbacks is shifting rapidly. Teams in need of experience behind young starters or as short-term bridges could be interested. Rumors already point to potential fits with clubs like the Minnesota Vikings, where Cousins spent much of his prime, or other organizations with uncertainty at the position.\n\nFor Atlanta, releasing Cousins clears a significant financial commitment and signals a full embrace of a youth movement — particularly around Penix, when healthy, or in pursuing new quarterback talent in free agency or the draft. It also gives the franchise more salary cap room to reshape key areas of the roster as they aim to return to playoff contention.\n\nAt 37, Cousins is at a crossroads. He doesn’t fit the long-term “franchise quarterback” mold teams chase in the draft, but his experience and pocket passing skill set still hold value in the right situation. Short-term starting opportunities — or veteran mentorship roles — could beckon. Teams like Pittsburgh, Minnesota, Indianapolis, and others with uncertain quarterback rooms may take a hard look.\n\nWhether Cousins chooses to continue his career or hangs up his cleats will be one of the storylines to follow as March approaches. What’s certain is this: his era in Atlanta is ending, and a new chapter, on a new team, is about to begin.\n\nOLYMPICS: Most talked-about Olympic romances from 2026 Winter Games\n\nNBA: Andrew Friedman, other Dodgers execs get new roles with Lakers after $10 billion sale\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: USA men’s hockey draws record Olympic gold medal TV viewership\n\nENTERTAINMENT: Martin Short’s daughter Katherine tragically dies at age 42\n\nVIRAL: Pat McAfee makes stunning gesture during Team USA’s $150K Gold medal celebration\n\nThe post Kirk Cousins future in the NFL has become clear after recent report appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Even with most of the Tennessee Titans' braintrust at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, the organization still made some roster moves.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Titans decided to part ways with veterans Xavier Woods and Lloyd Cushenberry (failed physical designation), freeing up roughly $7.1 million in salary cap space heading into free agency.\n\nCushenberry had a second uneven season in 2025, coming off an Achilles injury that cost him most of 2024. After struggling early in the season, he did improve as the season wore on, but a foot injury late in the season opened the door for Corey Levin, who played well in his absence.\n\nTitans released center Lloyd Cushenberry and safety Xavier Woods. Cushenberry was released with a failed physical designation.\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) February 25, 2026\n\nWith Levin scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent, the Titans are extremely thin along the interior of the offensive line, with only Trey Hill on the roster with NFL experience at center.\n\nWoods was brought in last offseason to be a veteran presence for both the defense and the secondary, but battled some injury issues and eventually gave way to rookie Kevin Winston Jr. as the season progressed. Woods finished 2025 with 11 games played and 39 total tackles. Unlike Cushenberry, Woods’ release did not accompany a failed physical designation, meaning he has recovered from the hamstring injury that landed him on injured reserve.\n\nThese two moves are likely the first of a flurry of activity in the coming days and weeks.

So it should be no surprise that when he was asked about the edge position and if the Titans had started dissecting the top prospects as the combine hits high gear.\n\n#Titans GM Mike Borgonzi shares his thoughts on the top 3 edge rushers in conversation for their No. 4 overall pick: Rueben Bain Jr., David Bailey, and Arvell Reese pic.twitter.com/6If2k24kp0\n\n— Lauren Walsh (@lauwalsh10) February 25, 2026\n\nWhile there was no clear indication of how the team is leaning, Borgonzi confirmed that all three prospects have had formal interviews with the Titans in Indianapolis, and they each bring something different to the table, ironically, all matching what defensive coordinator Gus Bradley described in his introductory press conference.\n\nBain profiles as a power guy with the ability to slide inside on passing downs, Bailey attacks with speed and length off the edge, and Reese is versatile with the ability and experience to add an explosive playmaker at multiple positions.\n\nThe Titans are in dire need of some playmakers on their front seven, and any of those three can make an impact. Unfortunately, until the team kicks off free agency and starts adding some talent to their roster, figuring out which impressive prospect they have zeroed in on is impossible.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Titans Wire: Tennessee Titans GM Mike Borgonzi breaks down top edge prospects",

Tackles Lee Hunter and Skyler Gill-Howard each relished their opportunities to take on blockers and let teammates fill in the gaps.\n\nThe immediate payoff came with the Red Raiders celebrating their first outright league title since 1955, their first Big 12 crown and their first College Football Playoff appearance.\n\nFour of the five transfers who helped transform Texas Tech into a national power received a different reward — appearing at the NFL's annual scouting combine in Indianapolis.\n\n“All five of those guys we had come in, they’re really good football players, tremendous football players, and pretty much they’re all here getting ready for the combine,” former teammate Jacob Rodriguez said Wednesday.\n\n\"Shoot, they’re even better human beings. The people that they care about, the way they came in the program and made a difference in the program was really special.”\n\nPlaying behind the speedy pass rushers and big, beefy interior linemen, the linebacker had the best season of his college career — 128 tackles, seven forced fumbles, four interceptions and two fumble recoveries. His draft prospects soared and Rodriguez finished fifth in Heisman Trophy balloting.\n\nStill, it was a costly proposition for Texas Tech, which paid an estimated $7 million to get the five game-changing linemen. Nearly half of that total reportedly went to Bailey, who some dubbed the highest-paid defensive player in college football's NIL era.\n\nBailey, of course, insists he was worth every penny and few at Texas Tech would quibble with him given the results.\n\n“They should have paid the inside linebackers a little bit more,” he said. “They were the leaders of the defense, everything ran through them.\"\n\nFor combine observers, this is life in a new world — one where more than 300 invitees no longer arrive dreaming of big paydays and joking about how some players might pocket less cash after turning pro.\n\n“I never had to deal with that,” 53-year-old New York Jets coach Aaron Glenn said, discussing the absence of NIL deals during his college days in the early 1990s. “I do know it's a real thing and a lot of these players are taking pay cuts (to play in the NFL). But I will say this is what they deserve, probably, because of the amount of money they bring to the college.”\n\nWednesday's interview room could have doubled as an entrepreneurs roundtable.\n\nAt one point, defensive tackle Cam Ball explained why he spent all five seasons at Arkansas and how he's attempting to honor his late father's passion for barbecuing. Ball grew up moving grills for his father's Atlanta-based catering company and once his NIL deals kicked in, he continued to help his father though no longer needed need the paycheck.\n\nToday, eight months after his father, Charles, died, Ball and his girlfriend are still cooking. Ball continues to perfect his secret, vinegar-based sauce with seasonings and trimmings his father taught him, while his girlfriend takes care of things such as baked beans and macaroni and cheese.\n\n“Every now and then I would help with the grills on his truck, I started to become more curious about it,” Ball said, with a large silver chain and a large photo of his father dangling near his heart. “When I got to college, I started experimenting on my own how to do things, how to cook, how to season meats because he taught me how to do all those things. We had NIL in my second or third year, so I didn't really need the money, I just wanted to get the experience.”\n\nFormer Bearcats defensive tackle Dontay Corleone, naturally, has an NIL deal with a Cincinnati restaurant that features “The Godfather” burger.\n\nAnd Hunter explained how he'd used his NIL money to buy his mother a house and a car, to care for his 5-year-old daughter, Kaylee, and to help his brother start a trucking business by purchasing two 18-wheelers.\n\n“It feels amazing,” Hunter said. “There's still more, now I'm working to get (my brother) a bigger truck. That's my goal, to provide for my family and the people I love.”\n\nTexas Tech gave Hunter that opportunity last season and he and the school both cashed in. Now the question is will that continue in the NFL?\n\nWhile Bailey could be a top-five selection and Hunter and Rodriguez are both ranked in the top 10 at their respective positions, the futures of Height and Gill-Howard are more uncertain. But at Texas Tech, there's no doubt about their overall value.\n\n“I think we had the best defensive front in the country this year. It was a lot of fun to play behind those guys and play with them,” Rodriguez said. “They should have paid them more, I guess. They were as advertised and better.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "10 Prospects Patriots Should Watch For At 2026 NFL Scouting Combine originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt's the most wonderful time of the year!\n\nThe New England Patriotshave officially started preparations for the 2026 NFL Draft, as they’ll spend the remainder of the week getting eyes on the best and brightest of the upcoming class out at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis — the schedule of which is as follows:\n\n2026 NFL Scouting Combine\nThursday, Feb. 26 (3-8 p.m. ET): DL, LB\nFriday, Feb. 27 (3-8 p.m. ET): DB, TE\nSaturday, Feb. 28 (1-8 p.m. ET): QB, WR, RB\nSunday, March 1 (1-5 p.m. ET): OL\n\nMike Vrabel and Eliot Wolf both spoke before on-field workouts began on Thursday, and helped give some clues as to what they’ll be looking for out of prospects that will take the field over the weekend.\n\nIt’s clear that there will be a focus on adding athleticism and pass-rush production on the defensive side of the ball, while some specific spots on the roster are clearly in need of an influx of talent — which brings us to these players in particular that the organization should keep an eye on:\n\nHilton was supposed to be in first-round conversations, as he began his collegiate career rated ahead of Malik Nabers, Brian Thomas Jr. and Jack Bech when they all arrived on campus at LSU in 2021 -- as well as future first-round picks Xavier Worthy and Marvin Harrison Jr.\n\nIt's safe to say that didn't happen, though you can't necessarily blame the player.\n\nHilton dealt with several injuries that ultimately ended three of his five seasons, but his elite track background (three-time state champion high jumper in Louisiana) and potential to come away from this event with the fastest 40-yard dash time (clocked at 22.13 mph in 2024) make him one of the most fascinating prospects who will work out this weekend. It's believed that he could rocket up draft boards with an elite performance, though he's still likely to be available on Day 3.\n\nNew England needs to add proven production at wide receiver, but after they do that, perhaps there's value in rolling the dice on someone who never quite lived up to the expectations set out for him at LSU -- after all, it did work out pretty well with Kayshon Boutte.\n\nNo, this isn't going to turn into one of those jokes about how a certain type of wide receiver always seems to find success at One Patriot Place...\n\nWetjen might kind of look like Julian Edelman, Wes Welker, Danny Amendola and Efton Chism III, but you aren't drafting him with the expectation that he'll turn into your next great slot receiver -- he'd make the roster based off his special teams acumen alone.\n\nWetjen is built like a running back (5-foot-9, 196 pounds) and listed as a wide receiver (23 career receptions), but his value comes in the kicking game. Iowa has sort of made a name developing guys like this, but there's no doubt who has been the best of the best, with the hybrid kick/punt returner leading the nation with 1,203 kick return yards, 891 punt return yards and six total return touchdowns across 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe Patriots need somebody to return kicks after releasing Antonio Gibson and presumably saying goodbye to D'Ernest Johnson, especially if there is still some trepidation about filling that role with the likes of TreVeyon Henderson or Kyle Williams. I can't imagine someone better suited for the role than this young man.\n\nHE'S GONE‼️\n\nKaden Wetjen returns it 8️⃣5️⃣ yards for the @HawkeyeFootball TD.#B1GFootball on @BigTenNetwork 📺 pic.twitter.com/GJDJevZTV5\n\n— Big Ten Football (@B1Gfootball) October 26, 2024\n\nIT'S TIME TO INVEST AT TIGHT END!\n\nHunter Henry was really good this past season, but he's entering the final year of his contract and is on the wrong side of 30. Austin Hooper is going to be an unrestricted free agent, and is on the wrong side of 30. Jack Westover is going to be a restricted free agent, and perhaps the only reason he'll be back is because he is on the right side of 30.\n\nIt's genuinely insane that this organization hasn't thought about life after it moves on from this current crop of talent at the position...\n\nI'd imagine they finally invest heavily at the position this offseason, something that was referred to by Vrabel on Wednesday, which means signing one of the many good options available in free agency (Isaiah Likely, David Njoku, Cade Otton and Chig Okonkwo) and drafting someone who could potentially develop into the future top option.\n\nKoziol is as good an option as any, as he possesses good size (6-foot-6, 245 pounds), has been productive (168 receptions and 14 touchdowns across 2024 and 2025) and would likely fall into your lap in the middle rounds (No. 3 TE, according to ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr.). I don't think he's going to transform the way this team plays football, but he's a functional second option at the position... and you need one of those.\n\nBentley is another good option if you're just looking for a high-floor guy who can play behind someone else, though he could give you a bit more of a bang for your buck.\n\nBentley exploded onto the scene this past season, finishing with 46 receptions, 620 receiving yards and six touchdowns -- just barely scraping by his previous career total of 3-20-0. Utah helped him put it all together by getting him the ball on underneath routes and allowing him to showcase his abilities after the catch, which is extremely impressive for someone who checks in at 6-foot-3, 262 pounds.\n\nHow many people can do a backflip at that size?\n\nI've seen teams fall in love with a lot less.\n\nIf you're looking for functional athleticism, this is your guy.\n\nLouis will test well over the weekend, but nothing he does will be all that surprising given what we've seen in game situations: he once blocked an extra point and returned it for the rare two-point conversion, had six interceptions and double-digit sacks across the last two seasons, was clocked as the fastest player on his team, etc.\n\nThe Patriots need to add speed to the second level and quite literally can't do any better than this hybrid player who has displayed shades of greatness.\n\nPerkins actually might be faster...\n\nIt's really difficult to evaluate him, however, as he has been insanely productive when healthy (35.5 tackles for loss, 17.0 sacks, five interceptions) but also has a season-ending injury under his belt and is extremely undersized (6-foot, 222 pounds).\n\nThe NFL very rarely gets it right with those kinds of players, but you can bet that someone will think they can figure it out given his undeniable talent. If they're right, they'll look like geniuses. If they're wrong, well... we'll all point and laugh.\n\n4️⃣ sacks\n2️⃣ forced fumbles\n\nHarold Perkins Jr. is a PROBLEM 😤 @LSUfootballpic.twitter.com/KxSOEvdC3f\n\n— SEC Network (@SECNetwork) November 12, 2022\n\nHill will almost certainly be gone by the time the Patriots are picking at No. 63, as he falls under the category of surefire starter at an undervalued position. It's the absolute worst place to be for a prospect (less money, virtually no guarantees) and the best place to be for a team (less money, virtually no guarantees).\n\nIf they're feeling like trading back, however...\n\nHill has enough versatility to drop back into coverage while occasionally rushing the passer, though that archetype often gets teams into trouble as they try to pigeonhole those players into pure pass-rush roles. Micah Parsons is an example of someone who that worked with. Edgerrin Cooper, Troy Andersen, Jamin Davis and Kenneth Murray are examples of the opposite.\n\nI'd imagine you've heard this name before.\n\nYoung is that guy who has been linked to New England ever since folks started really paying attention to prospects following Super Bowl LX.\n\nIt's safe to say there is no bigger need than the addition of pass-rush production, and no one really seems to care how they go about obtaining it -- whether that be trading for someone like Maxx Crosby, signing someone like Trey Hendrickson or letting the chips fall where they may and drafting one of the options that remains available during the second round like Young.\n\nIf you want to swing for the fences, this is the guy you do it for...\n\nFaulk will likely be gone by the time the Patriots pick at No. 31, but there could be opportunities to move up and grab -- or sit and wait for -- someone who looks (6-foot-6, 290 pounds)and acts (16.0 tackles for loss and 9.0 sacks across 2024 and 2025) the part.\n\nFaulk isn't the flashiest option, but his versatility and ability to be disruptive on every single down is really exciting to think about -- especially if you can envision what it would look like alongside Crosby/Hendrickson, Milton Williams and Christian Barmore.\n\nMore NFL: Patriots Offseason Preview: Everything Team Must Address In 2026",

    "fullText": "Todd Monken: Shedeur Sanders 'elite playmaking' and Browns QB competition notes from NFL Combine originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAs the NFL world gets ready to over analyze prospect workout drills at the Scouting Combine from Indianapolis this week, Cleveland Browns fans want to hear from their new head coach.\n\nTodd Monken spoke Wednesday at a Combine presser as he embarks on a juggernaut of a journey to rebuild this lethargic offense. Ranked 31st in points-per-game last season, the new skipper noted in his introduction meeting with the media after getting hired, that his goal is to “score points any way possible.”\n\nA huge part of any offensive success of course revolves around the starting quarterback. Unsurprisingly, many of the questions flying at the podium to Monken revolved around who would be under center.\n\nHere are the most important questions asked, and Monken’s answers:\n\nMore: Browns mock draft round-up: Experts stun with surprise defender & rising OL star\n\nQ- What has your evaluation of Shedeur Sanders been?\n\nMonken- “Elite playmaking ability. We saw it on tape, saw it last year, saw it college. Sure there’s a way to go, but what rookie doesn’t. I’m excited about Shedeur and all our quarterbacks”\n\nQ- How do you intend on distributing reps for quarterbacks in training camp?\n\nMonken- “You would hope that by training camp the majority of reps go to your starter…but we won’t know how that plays out until we get there.”\n\nQ- Will it be an open competition for starting quarterback?\n\nMonken- “Sure. I think it’s an open competition. I don’t know why it wouldn’t be. I don’t think there’s enough on film one way or the other to feel that we know who our starter is.”\n\nMonken- “Any time you have a player who at one time played at an elite level, you give them the benefit of the doubt to see if they can get that back. So he’ll get a chance. I don’t decide who plays, the players decide who plays…I’m excited to work with him, and excited to work with all our players.”\n\nQ- Does he think the starting QB could come from outside the organization?\n\nMonken- “The answer could be externally, I don’t know, we’ll do our due diligence and have to see.”\n\nQ- What is the “it factor” when you’re looking at quarterbacks coming out of the draft?\n\nMonken- “Have to vet people that have been around them for an extended period of time. Having a 20-minute interview (at the Combine) with a player isn’t nearly enough. How are they in a two-minute drill? Around teammates? Those answers are all important.”\n\nQ- Have you had a chance to study Ty Simpson, and what your thoughts are on him coming out in the draft?\n\nMonken- I like Ty a lot. Really good football player. His father was a Southern Miss alum, where I was head coach, so got to know him a little bit.\n\nThe head coach also was asked about what he’s looking for in offensive linemen since currently the Browns don’t have one starter from 2025 signed. “Most of all I’m looking for someone who’s physically tough and consistent. Everything else can be coached up if they are willing.”\n\nOne more piece of housekeeping is that assistant defensive line is the last coaching position that Monken has to fill out on his staff.\n\nThe new HC presented himself in a poised, confident manner. Now it’ll be up to GM Andrew Berry to give Monken the ingredients to cook up an explosive offense.\n\nNFL Combine tracker: 3 safeties the Browns must watch (who aren't Caleb Downs)\n\nDom Capers to Cleveland: What adding the legendary coach means for Browns 2026 defense\n\nTodd Monken’s ‘secret fix’ for Jerry Jeudy and Isaiah Bond: The Browns Zay Flowers strategy\n\nTop 3 tight end prospects to replace David Njoku: Browns must-watch list at 2026 NFL Combine\n\nMyles Garrett help?

    "fullText": "The Jacksonville Jaguars will play two home games in London during the 2026 NFL season, while the Washington Commanders will host the other London game.\n\nThe announcement comes a day after the Detroit Lions were confirmed as the host team for the NFL's return to Munich next season.\n\nThe NFL's sixth regular-season game in Germany will be particularly poignant for Detroit's wide receiver Amon-Ra St Brown and his family.\n\nThe 26-year-old's mother Miriam is German and he and his two brothers speak the language fluently. They have visited Germany often and it was Miriam who broke the news to her youngest son, external that his team will play at Allianz Arena.\n\n\"It has been a dream of mine to play a game in my mother's home country,\" said Amon-Ra. \"I cannot wait to play in front of the incredible fans that I've gotten to know through my visits and football camps.\"\n\nThe dates and the opponents for the games will be confirmed during the NFL's full schedule release in May.\n\nThey will be part of a record nine international games in 2026, across four continents, seven countries and eight stadiums.\n\n\"I think that's really cool for him,\" Henry Hodgson, general manager at NFL UK and Ireland, told BBC Sport. \"I was lucky to spend some time with his older brother, Equanimeous, at their family home in Cologne. They're really proud of their German heritage.\n\n\"Reflecting back on 2019, when Efe Obada got the chance to play at Tottenham with the Carolina Panthers, it's really special for players who have that history, that heritage in a country, to be able to go there and show people, in real life, what it is that they do.\n\n\"I'm sure he will embrace that opportunity. He's one of the most exciting receivers in the NFL and with a really successful team, so that's a really exciting game to be bringing to Munich.\"\n\nJacksonville have played in each London series since 2013 and this will be the third time they play back-to-back games in the UK.\n\nThe Jaguars were the first team to play two international games in the same season in 2023 and have taken the option to have two home games in London this year while their stadium is being renovated.\n\nThey will play at Wembley and Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the Washington Commanders hosting the other game at Tottenham.\n\nWhile Washington, who won three Super Bowls between 1983 and 1992, played in the NFL's first game in Spain last season, this will be just the second time the franchise has played in London and the first since 2016.\n\n\"Washington's traditionally had a good following in the UK,\" said Hodgson. \"It's been a long time since they were here so I think people will be excited to see the Commanders.\n\n\"They're just a year and a bit removed from being one game away from the Super Bowl, and I'm sure they are intent on finding their way back to the play-offs in 2026.\"\n\nHodgson also hinted at a special celebration to mark the 20th anniversary of the first regular-season game that was played in London in October 2007.\n\n\"The NFL continues to go from strength and strength when it comes to playing games around the world,\" he said. \"The commissioner and [team] ownership have been intent on really trying to find ways to expand the global footprint of the NFL, but at the heart of that is where this started.\n\n\"We've been here [in London] for nearly 20 years now so it's a really important market for the NFL. We've seen tremendous growth of the fanbase over that period of time, but yeah, the commitment by the NFL to playing in the UK is real and lasting.\n\n\"What's around the corner? Well, 2027 will be the 20th anniversary of games in London. We'll have to see what that brings.\"\n\nWhile the NFL will be playing games in Australia and France for the first time in 2026, the league will not make an immediate return to Ireland after staging its first Dublin game in 2025.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers' win over the Minnesota Vikings attracted more visitors from the United States than any of the NFL's 62 regular-season games played internationally.\n\nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell said during Super Bowl week that the league \"will be back, I would guess in a few years\" and Hodgson was in Dublin this week to discuss the economic impact of last year's game.\n\n\"I think the Irish government were particularly excited about what that had done in terms of bringing visitors and, ultimately, the [overall] impact,\" he said.\n\n\"After that, I was able to have a conversation with some of the folks that we'd worked with initially to bring the 2025 game to Dublin and we had some positive conversations about possibly bringing more games in the future.\n\n\"All of that is to be determined, but we said originally we would play a game there and then we would collectively sit down and reflect on whether it worked for both sides. I think everyone agrees that it was a real success by all standards and all measures.\"\n\nWhat's next for NFL as latest international games confirmed?\n\n49ers to host game as NFL makes Mexico return\n\nLondon, United Kingdom (two at Tottenham, one at Wembley)\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "When meeting with reporters at the 2026 NFL combine, general manager Chris Ballard provided an update on Indianapolis Colts' defensive tackle DeForest Buckner, who underwent a procedure on a neck injury.\n\nBuckner originally landed on injured reserve in Week 9 with a neck injury he sustained against Pittsburgh. After missing several weeks, Buckner returned for the Colts' Monday Night game against San Francisco in Week 16, but would reaggravate the injury.\n\nHe was then placed on injured reserve and had successful surgery before the Colts' 2025 season was over.\n\n\"He's good,\" Ballard said of Buckner. \"I think it was some relief for Buck when he got it done. He's had injuries in his career but really it was the first time that he had one that was pretty serious. And then getting the surgery done, the relief that I think he felt -- one, knowing I feel better. Instantly felt better. And two, I can play football again.\"\n\nCompared to the defensive tackle position group league-wide, Buckner ranks 24th in pass rush win rate and 14th in PFF's run stop rate metric.\n\nEven with missing most of the second half of the season, Buckner is still second on the Colts' defense in pressures.\n\nThe 2026 season is the final year of Buckner's current deal. Ballard expects that Buckner will be good to go for training camp, if not sooner.\n\n\"I'm not going to put a timeframe on it,\" Ballard said. \"We're expecting him back for training camp. The way he works and who he is, it wouldn't surprise me if it's sooner. But he'll be back and he'll be ready to go and I think he'll have a good year.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: 2026 NFL combine: What Colts' Chris Ballard said about DeForest Buckner",

    "fullText": "We are just under two months away from the actual 2026 NFL draft, and the mock drafts have already gotten a bit boring for the Arizona Cardinals, at least in those created by analysts for NFL.com. The Cardinals have the third overall pick in the draft and have several needs, but the recent batch of projections have them going with the same player.\n\nBucky Brooks published his second mock draft of the year. He has the Cardinals going with an offensive tackle.\n\nWith or without Kyler Murray, the Cardinals need to find a tackle to man the right side opposite athletic LT Paris Johnson Jr. Mauigoa is a talented edge blocker with the size, strength and nastiness to bully opponents at the point of attack.\n\nAs boring as it sounds, the pick makes sense. The Cardinals have a gaping hole at right tackle and uncertainty at quarterback. Locking down another side of the line will help whoever is starting under center.\n\nIt would mark the first time under general manager Monti Ossenfort selects a player outside the Big Ten or SEC in the first or second round of the draft, but the Cardinals recently added two former Miami assistants to their staff.\n\nHowever, if Ohio State linebacker Arvell Reese is on the board as he is in this mock draft, it will be hard for the Cardinals now to take him, as they also have a huge need for an edge rusher to pair with Josh Sweat.\n\nAlso, keep an eye on Ohio State safety Caleb Downs. While safety is not a premium position and Ossenfort would be out of character to go with a safety in the top five, the Cardinals love Ohio State players.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "NFL fans have been dissecting Nick Sirianni’s latest comments about A.J. Brown after the Philadelphia Eagles head coach stopped short of offering a firm guarantee over the wide receiver’s future.\n\nBrown remains one of the franchise’s most important offensive weapons, but uncertainty around next season has sparked debate online.\n\nSirianni’s words have only added fuel to that discussion.\n\nSirianni said via ESPN, “A.J.’s a great player, and A.J. is a good teammate, and A.J. is a good person. Does he want to be here? Yes. Do I want him to be here? Yes.”\n\nHe continued, “Will A.J. be here next season? I think we’re still in a spot, like, I can’t guarantee how anything is going to play out into next season.\n\n“I’m thinking I’m going to be the coach next season, but you can’t guarantee anything past tomorrow.”\n\nThe response struck a balanced tone, praising Brown’s value while acknowledging the unpredictable nature of the NFL.\n\nContract dynamics, roster construction, and league movement can quickly alter situations, even for star players.\n\nReactions online ranged from alarm to dismissal. Some supporters immediately interpreted the lack of a guarantee as a warning sign, with one fan posting, “He’s gone. Bills for a deuce and Keon!” Another concluded, “So basically he won’t be in the squad for the Eagles next season.”\n\nSpeculation about potential destinations also surfaced. “Hard to be an Eagle when he’s a Patriot,” one comment read, hinting at divisional drama. Others urged caution, warning that “Letting go of A.J Brown will be a huge mistake.”\n\nNot everyone saw cause for panic. One fan countered the uproar by saying, “If anyone spends more than 5 seconds reading this headline, it’s obvious that they want him in Philly.”\n\nFor now, Sirianni’s stance suggests mutual interest remains. Whether that translates into long-term certainty will depend on decisions made in the months ahead.\n\nNick Sirianni gives cryptic answer about A.J.

He’s said he wants to play for a contender.\n\nRaiders GM John Spytek said he anticipates Crosby being on the team and added he had a “great conversation” with him. He also pointed to the New England Patriots going from 4-13 in 2024 to playing in the Super Bowl in 2025 as an example of a team that can dramatically improve from one season to the next.\n\nHowever, when asked if Crosby is an “untradeable player,” Spytek said: “We’re always listening, man.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "How the 49ers' contract dispute with Trent Williams could impact the NFL Draft originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers cannot afford to lose Canton-bound left tackle Trent Williams.\n\nThe only problem is that they cannot afford to pay him, either.\n\nSan Francisco is dealing with the consequences of an aging roster and an unfulfilled competitive window. With stars demanding raises and a Super Bowl in sight, the 49ers have kicked the cap can down the road long enough. It has come back to bite them, and as Williams inches closer to free agency, San Francisco may have to look to the NFL Draft for his replacement.\n\nOn Tuesday, Adam Schefter reported that releasing Williams is on the table.\n\n\"With five-time All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams scheduled to carry a $39 million cap number this season, he and the 49ers currently are struggling to find a contractual solution, per league sources,\" he posted. \"If the two sides can’t bridge their differences in their standoff, Williams would be expected to join this year’s free-agent class, making him one of the premier players available.\"\n\nOf course, that's not a guarantee of Williams' departure. But Williams is perhaps the most valuable offensive lineman in the sport, appearing bulletproof into his late-30s. He's a stalwart in the game's preeminent rushing attack. And as a crux of Kyle Shanahan's scheme, there's reason to believe the 49ers view the position at a premium.\n\nThe first and most obvious pivot from Williams is an early-round selection in the 2026 NFL Draft. In a tackle class that has fallen short of expectations, a handful of candidates have fallen toward the back of Round 1.\n\nAmong them is Alabama's Kadyn Proctor. At 360 pounds, there are questions about how consistently his athleticism will play at the next level, but high-level play against SEC defensive lines has kept his stock high. Elsewhere, Caleb Lomu held down the blindside for Utah's elite offensive line, offering a more natural fit into Shanahan's zone scheme (at least physically). He's a work in progress as a run blocker, but a first-round pass protector with traits that inspire upside.\n\nLate in Round 1, San Francisco is also in range to capture upward momentum on a prospect like Monroe Freeling, who is bound to rise when athletic testing becomes the most recent source of information.\n\nMORE: 49ers get bad news on Trent Williams amid looming $39 million decision\n\nTaking a first-round tackle could reverberate throughout the NFL's toughest division. The Los Angeles Rams are unsteady at offensive tackle. Right tackle Rob Havenstein has retired, and Warren McClendon Jr. isn't necessarily the long-term answer in his place. The positional difference could render this moot, but the 49ers pick before Los Angeles' second pick in the first round.\n\nThere's a world in which the Rams lose out on their preferred tackle prospect because the 49ers feel they can turn Blake Miller -- or a similarly-valued prospect -- into their franchise left tackle.\n\nFurthermore, it may become clear that replacing Williams isn't a one-man job, but a structural one. San Francisco isn't drafting an upgrade at left tackle in Round 1. Baking in that regression could mean a greater emphasis on other positions, like drafting a receiver for Brandon Aiyuk's vacant snaps or a defensive X-factor to compensate for a step back offensively.\n\nUltimately, teams do an excellent job of keeping their best players in-house for as long as possible. There's little reason why Williams should retire in another team's jersey, and he's enough of a difference-maker to gamble on, even at 37 years old. Losing Williams would be the biggest transaction of San Francisco's offseason, leaving awfully big shoes to fill for whoever the 49ers take at No. 27.\n\nKyle Shanahan has slim pickings to develop next castoff quarterback\n\n49ers get good news on Mac Jones trade rumors\n\nA.J.

    "description": "We ask Miami Dolphins fans about the emphasis that teams put on players results from the annual NFL Scouting Combine.",
    "fullText": "It’s that time again, time for the annual NFL Scouting Combine, where the top players in college football who have declared for the NFL draft and are specifically invited are brought to Indianapolis, Indiana’s Lucas Oil Stadium. Each player is then run through a variety of drills and tests based on their position, unless they opt out of a certain phase of the testing. The individual teams’ staff also hold personal interviews with various players that they may be interested in drafting during the annual NFL draft held the following April.\n\nThe Combine can make or break an individual player’s draft status and where they are actually selected. Even the highest-rated players can damage their draft stock with poor testing numbers or a poor personal interview. The reverse is also true: guys who are assumed to be picked much later before the combine can move up the draft, sometimes by a substantial amount, if they are better than expected in their testing and interviews.\n\nWith all of that in mind, this evening’s question is something that I have wondered and at times for sure believed as a long-time (like a very long time) Miami Dolphins fan. So this evening’s question of the day is:\n\nDo you think that our own Miami Dolphins or even the NFL in general has, in the past, relied too much on combine numbers and interviews as opposed to what the players have put on tape in college, in the past, when deciding who to draft, especially in the higher rounds?\n\nPlease share your thoughts and answers in the comments section below-",

    "description": "Lions GM Brad Holmes addressed David Montgomery’s future during his 2026 NFL Scouting Combine press conference amid speculation following his reduced role in 2025.",
    "fullText": "David Montgomery’s future with the Detroit Lions remains one of the quieter but more intriguing storylines of the 2026 offseason.\n\nAfter a 2025 campaign that featured a noticeable reduction in touches, questions began to surface about where Montgomery fits moving forward, especially as Jahmyr Gibbs continued to emerge as one of the NFL’s most dynamic offensive weapons. While Montgomery remained effective when called upon, Detroit’s offensive identity shifted, and that shift inevitably fueled speculation about a potential separation.\n\nOn Tuesday at the 2026 NFL Scouting Combine, Lions general manager Brad Holmes addressed the situation directly.\n\nHolmes made it clear that lines of communication between the Lions and Montgomery’s camp are open and active.\n\n“I’ve been in touch with David’s agent and his representation, and, obviously we love David,” Holmes said. “He’s a great player and we’d love to have him.”\n\nThat statement alone reinforces how highly Montgomery is still regarded inside the organization. His physical running style, professionalism, and leadership have been integral to Detroit’s rise over the past two seasons, even if his role shifted statistically in 2025.\n\nMontgomery’s dip in touches wasn’t about decline, it was about evolution.\n\nWith Gibbs demanding more usage and the Lions leaning heavily into a high-powered passing attack, Detroit prioritized efficiency over volume at running back. Montgomery still handled key short-yardage situations, pass protection duties, and physical late-game carries, but the offense no longer revolved around a traditional workhorse approach.\n\nThat change, however, naturally raised questions about long-term fit.\n\nHolmes acknowledged that both sides must want the same future for a return to make sense.\n\n“We kinda want to put last year in the rear view and move forward, but a player has to want to be at a certain place as well,” Holmes said. “So, those conversations are still fluid.”\n\nThat comment is telling. Detroit appears open to resetting expectations and redefining Montgomery’s role, but the final decision may hinge on whether Montgomery is comfortable with that vision as he enters the next phase of his career.\n\nWith free agency approaching and multiple roster decisions looming, the Lions want clarity without forcing an outcome. Holmes’ comments suggested patience, respect, and realism, three traits that have defined Detroit’s front office under his leadership.\n\nFor now, Montgomery’s future remains unresolved, but the door is clearly not closed. Whether that door stays open will depend on alignment, opportunity, and timing as the Lions continue shaping a roster built to contend in 2026 and beyond.\n\nThe post Brad Holmes Addresses David Montgomery’s Future With Detroit Lions appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "fullText": "Every year, the football world shifts its attention to one of the most important checkpoints in the pre-draft calendar — the NFL Scouting Combine. Hosted in Indianapolis at Lucas Oil Stadium, the event marks the true beginning of draft season for front offices across the National Football League. It’s where film study meets measurable reality — where speed, explosiveness, strength, and movement skills are tested under a microscope. For prospects, it’s not just an evaluation; it’s a high-stakes job interview played out in front of coaches, executives, and scouts from every team.\n\nThis year’s spotlight centers on the players ranked at the top of Daniel Jeremiah’s latest top prospect board, a group loaded with elite athletic traits and immediate NFL potential. The list reflects the modern direction of the league — explosive edge defenders, versatile defensive backs, dynamic skill players, and quarterbacks capable of handling complex offensive systems. While game tape built their reputations, the combine will test how those traits translate in standardized drills and competitive environments. For some, it’s a chance to confirm elite status. For others, it’s an opportunity to rise dramatically with one standout performance.\n\nAs the drills begin and the testing numbers roll in, these top prospects enter the most revealing phase of their pre-draft journey. The combine won’t finalize their draft positions — but it will shape the conversation around them in a big way.\n\nMendoza carries himself like a true franchise quarterback, showing poise and command in high-pressure situations. His arm talent allows him to make layered throws with timing and precision, while his size helps him absorb contact and stay composed. He processes defenses quickly and rarely looks rushed mentally. Teams see a quarterback who can operate structure but still create when plays break down.\n\nLove is one of the most explosive offensive weapons in the class, capable of scoring from anywhere on the field. His acceleration through the hole and long-speed in open space make him a constant big-play threat. He runs with patience and vision, then flips a switch once he sees daylight. If his testing matches the tape, he’ll solidify elite playmaker status.\n\nBailey is a disruptive edge rusher with the power and burst to stress offensive tackles snap after snap. He plays with physical urgency, attacking the pocket and forcing quarterbacks off their spots. His length helps him control contact and win leverage battles at the line. Evaluators are especially intrigued by how much more upside he still has as his pass-rush toolbox develops.\n\nReese is an explosive athlete off the edge with range that shows up against both the run and pass. He closes space quickly and flashes the ability to wreck plays in the backfield. His pursuit motor stands out — he doesn’t quit on plays and consistently chases down ball carriers. With refinement, he has the traits of a high-impact defensive playmaker.\n\nStyles brings size, speed, and versatility that allow him to impact the game in multiple defensive roles. He moves fluidly in coverage but also plays with downhill force against the run. His physical profile makes him a matchup eraser against modern hybrid offenses. Coaches value defenders who can stay on the field in any situation — Styles fits that mold.\n\nBain is a relentless pass rusher who plays with power, urgency, and technical discipline. He consistently generates pressure by converting speed to strength and attacking leverage points. His intensity shows in how hard he plays every snap, especially in pursuit. He profiles as the type of defender offenses must account for in protection schemes.\n\nTate is a refined route runner who wins with timing, precision, and body control. He tracks the ball naturally and consistently positions himself to make difficult catches look routine. His game is built on reliability — quarterbacks can trust him to be exactly where he’s supposed to be. He projects as a dependable high-volume receiving target.\n\nDelane is a long, athletic corner with strong coverage instincts and physical press ability. He competes aggressively at the catch point and shows confidence challenging receivers downfield. His movement skills allow him to stay attached through routes and recover when needed. He has the traits teams look for in a boundary corner who can handle top matchups.\n\nDowns is a true playmaking safety with range, awareness, and sharp diagnostic skills. He reads offensive concepts quickly and arrives at the ball with decisive speed. Whether in coverage or run support, he consistently impacts plays with sound positioning. His instincts and football IQ make him one of the most complete defensive backs in the class.\n\nLemon is an electric playmaker whose acceleration and agility stand out immediately. He thrives after the catch, turning short receptions into explosive gains with quick cuts and burst. His ability to stretch the field vertically adds another dimension to his game. Offenses will value his versatility and big-play potential from multiple alignments.\n\nUltimately, this group represents the talent expected to define the early portion of the 2026 NFL Draft. The combine serves as both validation and opportunity — confirming what evaluators believe while opening the door for new storylines. From measurable dominance to unexpected breakout performances, this week helps transform top prospects into future professionals.\n\nOLYMPICS: Final 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings\n\nNFL: 4 blockbuster NFL trades we want to see before the 2026 draft\n\nNFL DRAFT: 2026 NFL Scouting Combine day-to-day TV schedule, how to watch\n\nMLB: MLB Power Rankings as 2026 Spring Training begins\n\nNBA: Updated NBA Power Rankings as a new week begins\n\nVIRAL: Watch Johnny Gaudreau’s children join Team USA hockey gold medal celebration\n\nThe post Top draft prospects ahead of the 2026 NFL scouting combine appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "NFL insider Ian Rapoport believes Green Bay Packers quarterback Malik Willis -- who is headed for unrestricted free agency as arguably the top available quarterback -- will eventually sign a deal worth $30 to 35 million per year.\n\n\"If Justin Fields gets $20 million a year, what does Malik Willis get? 30? 35? That's my guess as to what it is,\" Rapoport said on Gregg Rosenthal's \"NFL Daily\" podcast on Monday.\n\nRosenthal, who ranked Willis as his No. 1 free agent this offseason, estimated that the Packers backup quarterback will get a deal between $35 and 40 million, and Rapoport didn't disagree.\n\n\"I think that's probably right,\" Rapoport said.\n\nRapoport and Rosenthal discussed the possibility of Willis landing with the Miami Dolphins (Jeff Hafley and Jon-Eric Sullivan connection) and Arizona Cardinals (Matt and Mike LaFleur connection), but Rapoport wondered if the two teams could afford Willis given the money already committed to Tua Tagovailoa in Miami and Kyler Murray in Arizona.\n\nAt $30 million per year, Willis would slot in as a mid-tier starting quarterback. The top of the market at the position is over $50 million. There is a big gap between Fields, who signed a $20 million deal with the New York Jets last offseason, and the next tier, which features Baker Mayfield, Sam Darnold and Geno Smith in the $30 million to $35 million range.\n\nWillis appears to be in position to easily beat the Fields deal and slot in somewhere in the Mayfield-Darnold-Smith range.\n\nAnd the Packers are looking more and more likely to get a third-round compensatory draft pick in 2027 when Willis signs his next deal.\n\nThe Packers acquired Willis, a 2022 third-round pick, for a seventh-round pick before the 2024 season. Over the last two seasons in Green Bay, Willis resurrected his career -- completing 70 of 89 passes for 972 yards, six touchdown passes and zero interceptions and rushing for 123 yards and two more scores over 11 games and three starts with the Packers.\n\nWillis got a showcase start in primetime against the Ravens in December, and he completed 18 of 21 passes for 288 yards and a touchdown and rushed for 60 yards and two more scores in a defeat.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers Wire: QB Malik Willis could get $30-35 million per year in free agency",

    "fullText": "Fairhope (Ala.) St. Michael Catholic four-star quarterback Gunner Rivers is following in his father’s legendary footsteps.\n\nThe son of former NFL star and future Hall of Famer Philip Rivers has committed to NC State, choosing to join the Wolf Pack 26 years after his father did back in 2000. Gunner chose NC State over reported offers from Auburn, Georgia, Miami, Boston College and more.\n\nOne of the top quarterbacks nationally in the 2027 class, Rivers has long been thought of as a lean to the school where his father won ACC Player of the Year honors in 2003 and Rivers broke almost every NC State and ACC passing record.\n\nGunner himself has had a record-breaking high school career and is coming off a junior season where he completed 208 of 290 passes (72%) for 2,813 yards, 44 touchdowns and just five interceptions. In the process, he led St. Michael Catholic to a 13-1 record and an appearance in the state title game vs. powerhouse Jackson.\n\nStanding in at 6’3 and 200 pounds, he ranks as the nation’s No. 117 overall prospect and No. 12 quarterback, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, an equally weighted average that utilizes all three major recruiting services.\n\nHe also ranks as the No. 4 player from the state of Alabama this cycle.\n\nRivers is undoubtedly one of NC State’s biggest football recruiting wins in program history. His pledge gives head coach Dave Doeren and the Wolfpack four commits early on in the 2027 cycle.\n\nRivers joins Homerville (Ga.) Clinch County three-star safety Kamarion Johnson, Raleigh (N.C.) Cardinal Gibbons three-star tight end Griffin Cockerham and Southeast Raleigh three-star running back Christian Freeman.\n\nLast cycle, NC State signed the nation’s No. 46 class, according to the Rivals Industry Team Recruiting Rankings. It’s early, but the addition of Rivers could provide the Wolfpack with some serious recruiting momentum heading into the spring.\n\nNC State has not signed a top-25 class in the internet recruiting era. It’s highest-ranked haul came in the 2008 cycle, when it landed the No. 26 class that was headlined by four-star QB Mike Glennon.",

    "fullText": "The NFL Competition Committee has discussed a change to the league's rules that would allow replay officials throw penalty flags for fouls that went unpunished on the field.\n\nNFL executive vice president of football operations Troy Vincent said on Monday that the conversation centered on non-football acts that were unpenalized by on-field officials.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nStaying in Buffalo ‼️\n\nWe have re-signed OL Alec Anderson and DT Phidarian Mathis each to one year contracts.\n\n— Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) February 23, 2026\n\nMathis, who will turn 28 in April, was chosen 47th overall by the Washington Commanders in the 2022 NFL Draft. He spent three injury-plagued seasons with the club, totaling just 25 tackles and two tackles for loss across only 23 games. Washington released him in December 2024, and he signed with the New York Jets’ practice squad. He did not appear in a game for Gang Green, and he was released in August 2025.\n\nMathis signed with Buffalo’s practice squad on September 10, 2025. The Bills elevated him for two contests—a 23-20 loss to the New England Patriots in Week Five and a 28-21 win over the Kansas City Chiefs in Week Eight—before signing him to their 53-man roster on November 5. Mathis played in four more games during the regular season, and in two of them, he was a huge contributor. He had four tackles in victories over the Cleveland Browns and the New York Jets. Overall, he showed good burst and solid anchor against the run, totaling 13 tackles in his six regular season games.\n\nMathis also played six snaps in the Bills’ Wild Card victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. At 6’4” and 312 lbs. with 34.5” arms, he profiles as someone who can play multiple spots along an odd-man defensive line, which is the scheme the Bills will utilize under new defensive coordinator Jim Leonhard. Coming out of Alabama, NFL Network’s Lance Zierlein called him a “scheme-versatile player” who could play nose tackle in either an odd front or an even front, or a 5-tech defensive end in a 3-4 scheme. Zierlein’s professional comparison for Mathis was DaQuan Jones, Buffalo’s top 1-tech defensive tackle for the last four seasons.\n\nNews had previously leaked regarding Buffalo re-signing offensive lineman Alec Anderson, and the Bills officially announced his signing in the same release announcing the Mathis contract.",

Not only was Gibson little more than a rotational option in the Patriots’ backfield with an unclear outlook given that Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson reside atop the depth chart, he also is currently rehabbing a torn ACL suffered in October.\n\nThat said, let’s take a bigger-picture view at what the transaction means from a New England perspective.\n\nThe Patriots entered the offseason with six true running backs under contract for the 2026 season, including Gibson as the projected RB3 behind the aforementioned Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson. With him no longer a piece of the puzzle, one layer of depth has been removed behind the top pair and is leaving the group looking as follows:\n\nRunning back (5): Rhamondre Stevenson (38), TreVeyon Henderson (32), Terrell Jennings (26), Lan Larison (34), Elijah Mitchell (45)\n\nOutside of those six players, the Patriots also have two backfield players headed for free agency. Both running back Deneric Prince and fullback Jack Westover are exclusive rights free agents.\n\nEven if Prince and Westover are retained, the Patriots are lacking established depth or long-term developmental upside behind Stevenson and Henderson. While they project as a formidable one-two punch, no Gibson as the third option means that the team might be on the lookout for another player with a similarly versatile skillset.\n\nBefore tearing his ACL in Week 5 against the Buffalo Bills, Gibson had not just served as the Patriots’ third running back but also their top kickoff return man. As such, he had averaged 28.5 yards on his 12 runbacks and also scored a 90-yard touchdown in Week 2 versus Miami.\n\nOnce Gibson was lost for the year, the Patriots were unable to find similar production and home-run potential. Six other players returned kickoffs for them on the year — running backs Rhamondre Stevenson, TreVeyon Henderson, Terrell Jennings and D’Ernest Johnson as well as wide receivers Kyle Williams and Efton Chism III — but none emerged as a clear featured option.\n\nWith Gibson now officially out of the picture, the competition will start at zero again. Based on flashes, Henderson and Williams seem like the frontrunners at the moment, but there are a lot of factors plus future roster changes that are likely to change that projection.\n\nOne of the reasons why Gibson getting released was no surprise was his contract. Carrying a $4.14 million salary cap number, he was the 21st most-expensive player on the team right now. That in itself might not have been a release-worthy problem, but the structure of the pact invited a change: only his $1 million signing bonus proration for the 2026 season was fully-guaranteed.\n\nThat $1 million will now be added to the Patriots’ dead cap space for 2026. Meanwhile, the team created $2.14 million in net savings: his gross savings of $3.14 million minus another player with a $1 million salary cap number taking his spot on the Top 51 list of contracts to be counted against the cap once the new league year starts in mid-March.\n\nAccording to salary cap expert Miguel Benzan, Gibson’s release now puts the Patriots $44.3 million under a projected league cap of $304.3 million.\n\nConsidering that Gibson was released with a failed physical designation, however, it appears that he qualifies for the NFL’s injury protection benefit. If so and he remains unsigned heading into the new season, the Patriots might be charged $2.1 million against their cap at the start of the regular season. In that case, the financial gains of releasing the 27-year-old would be minimal.\n\nThe Patriots’ 2024 offseason was their first without Bill Belichick presiding over their football operations. So, who was the first free agent added under the new regime led by Eliot Wolf and then-head coach Jerod Mayo? That would be one Mr. Antonio Gibson.\n\nWith Gibson now gone, so is another remnant of the Mayo-era Patriots. In fact, less than 14 months after his firing, only 23 players remain with the team who played under the one-and-done coach as pointed out by Ethan. Hurwitz of Sports Illustrated.\n\nWith Antonio Gibson's release, here's the list of remaining Patriots under contract for 2026 that played under Jerod Mayo:\n\n– Christian Gonzalez\n– DeMario Douglas\n– Kayshon Boutte\n– Drake Maye\n– Marte Mapu\n– Bryce Baringer\n– Dell Pettus\n– Marcus Jones\n– Terrell Jennings\n-…\n\n— Ethan Hurwitz (@HurwitzSports) February 23, 2026\n\nWhile his failed physical might have forced their hand a bit, the Patriots had no real reason to release Gibson now as opposed to closer to the start of free agency on March 11. However, with the entire league embarking on Indianapolis this week for the NFL Scouting Combine, getting cut now allows Gibson a head start of sorts.\n\nSure, teams will be cautious when it comes to a running back who tore his ACL just four months ago, but Gibson’s name is at least out there already and he can start taking visits and undergoing physical examination with other clubs right away. Other veteran running backs who might end up competing against him on the open market might not be in that same position yet.",

    "description": "The Saints are in prime position at eighth overall. NFL draft expert Daniel Jeremiah says 'I don't know that there's a wrong answer' for New Orleans.",
    "fullText": "Whoever they pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, the New Orleans Saints have a great opportunity to make life easier for Tyler Shough. The second-year quarterback impressed across nine starts as a rookie but the team still owns a top-10 pick. Some great prospects are expected to be available when they go on the clock at eighth overall. NFL Media draft expert Daniel Jeremiah linked the Saints to Notre Dame star running back Jeremiyah Love in his first mock draft. He had them going with playmaking USC wideout Makai Lemon in his second projection.\n\n\"That would be a great decision to have if you have a guy like Makai Lemon there and then Jeremiyah Love,\" Jeremiah said on a pre-combine conference call. \"So I wanted to see what it would look like there and try and find a compliment to Chris Olave. I think (Lemon) would catch a bazillion balls in that offense from that quarterback with Kellen calling plays. ... So that was, you know, that was kind of looking at a different option there. I don't know that there's a wrong answer.\"\n\nWhat is it about these two prospects that is so appealing? Lemon has been surging to the forefront of Saints mock drafts in recent weeks, and for his part, Jeremiah is a big fan: \"Think (Moore) would know exactly how to use Makai Lemon and he'll give you easy completions for a young quarterback. He can work in the middle of the field. He's tough. He can help you out if you need him to dig out a linebacker in the run game as well.\"\n\nBut if he likes Love so much, why did Jeremiah pivot from the running back to the wide receiver? He explained: \"There is something to, okay, when the team is ready to really take off, then you drop in the running back. You utilize all of his carries. They all matter and they're helping you, you know, get in the playoffs and chase the championship. I think there's some other pieces to fill before you say that, you know, rocket's ready to take off there in New Orleans. So I kind of like the idea of letting Makai Lemon grow with a young quarterback and they can play together for seven, ten years or so. I just thought that would be a fun fit.\"\n\nWhether they go with a receiver or a rusher, the goal is the same -- get another weapon for Shough to lean on. Depending on the team's moves in free agency (bolstering the offensive line and signing other pass-catchers, or another running back) they could be set up to comfortably take Love and chase a playoff berth in the weak NFC South. Alvin Kamara isn't getting younger and he's playing in the last year of their contract. No team has had a less explosive run game over the last five years than New Orleans. Lemon could be a fun compliment to Olave, but at some point the Saints must inject real game-changing talent to their backfield. Maybe they'll find a way to do that before the draft gets here in late April.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Saints Wire: Daniel Jeremiah: Saints don't have a 'wrong answer' in 2026 NFL Draft",

For now, the Bengals have some time to make a decision.\n\nAnd with the NFL Scouting Combine getting underway, the Bengals might be getting a good idea of what they'll do this offseason. Paul Dehner Jr. of The Athletic notes that the Bengals might be able to gauge interest in Hendrickson at the Combine this week.\n\n\"The team is open to all options,\" Dehner writes, \"but how likely executing a trade would be based on his market and cooperation from Hendrickson's agent can be determined in Indianapolis.\"\n\nThe Bengals moving on from Hendrickson in a tag-and-trade is the most ideal path forward for Cincinnati this offseason.\n\nLetting him walk doesn't guarantee the compensatory pick hits, and even if it does, it might not be a third-rounder that the Bengals are looking for.\n\nIn a perfect world, the Bengals tag-and-trade Hendrickson this offseason, landing guaranteed value for their All-Pro pass rusher.\n\nMore: Why Bengals should prioritize Joe Flacco over Trey Hendrickson in free agency\n\nAt the NFL Combine, the Bengals will be able to gauge interest in Hendrickson from interested teams showing up to watch the top prospects in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThis will be a big chance for the Bengals to figure out what their best path forward with Hendrickson will be. If they get interest from teams, executing a tag-and-trade with Hendrickson could be in the cards.\n\nFans should keep an eye out for any rumors with Hendrickson at the NFL Scouting Combine.

This data also only included new additions and not any re-signings.\n\nDuring that span, the Colts' 15 free agent additions that qualify for this list are tied for the sixth-fewest in the NFL. Indianapolis is also the eighth-lowest spender in average free agent dollars each offseason at $125.98 million.\n\nHowever, when GM Chris Ballard has made signings, he has spent big, with the Colts average contract per player ranking near the top of the league at $8.39 million.\n\nOverall, the Colts are ranked 27th in Fitzgerald's rankings.\n\n\"We like our guys,\" is a familiar phrase that Ballard has said over the years, which is, in part, why the Colts rank near the bottom of this free agency spending list.\n\nLast offseason, however, we saw a more aggressive approach. This included signing Daniel Jones and spending fairly big on Charvarius Ward and Cam Bynum.\n\nBallard seemingly acknowledged that continuing down that path was going to be the plan this offseason.\n\nThe Colts are positioned relatively well from a salary cap standpoint to do so as well.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: NFL free agency: Where do Colts rank in free agent spending since 2020?",

    "fullText": "The Chargers will most likely address the interior part of the offensive line, especially the guard spots, with Bradley Bozeman and Mekhi Becton being potential cut candidates.\n\nShould they go the free agency route, Sports Illustrated's Connor Orr believes the Bolts will sign veteran Joel Bitonio, whom he tabbed in his bold predictions for all 32 teams in the NFL.\n\nJim Harbaugh is not going to put Justin Herbert at risk again like he was forced to last season. Bitonio can spearhead the offensive line’s transition to a Mike McDaniel system—Bitonio was drafted during McDaniel’s season as the Browns’ receivers coach—and could be a critical, dependable asset amid constant injury woes.\n\nBitonio is not getting any younger, set to be 35 this season and is considering retirement, but he is durable and is still moving as if he were ten years younger.\n\nA stalwart presence along the Browns' offensive line for the past decade, Bitonio finished the 2025 season ranked as PFF's 8th-best pass-blocking guard. He has also ranked in the 91st percentile in PFF run-blocking grade over the past three seasons.\n\nOffensive coordinator Mike McDaniel was on the Browns' staff as the wide receiver coach in 2014, Bitonio's first season in Cleveland, so the familiarity is there. Plus, Bitonio is a great fit in McDaniel's zone scheme.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chargers Wire: NFL analyst's 'bold prediction' sees Chargers bolstering guard spot",

    "description": "Tyreek Hill next team odds. Chiefs drawing shortest NFL odds to land All-Pro wide receiver after release from Dolphins.",
    "fullText": "Want to get more Covers content? Add us as a preferred source on your Google account here.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins released wide receiver Tyreek Hill on Monday, February 16, finally ending a union that seemed destined for a breakup sooner rather than later.\n\nThe eight-time Pro-Bowler played in just four games in 2025 before suffering a season-ending ACL injury. What began as a perfect match, and briefly looked like the best offense in football alongside Jayden Waddle as Tua Tagovailoa's primary weapons, Hill's time in Miami appeared to sour by the end of 2024.\n\nNow, the hapless Dolphins and the 31-year-old receiver are embarking on different paths. Below, we'll look at the latest NFL odds for Hill's next destination — and why a reunion with Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs feels inevitable.\n\nFrom 2016-21, Tyreek Hill was a mainstay in the Kansas City Chiefs offense, racking up 6,630 receiving yards and 56 touchdowns over 91 games. He made the Pro Bowl every season in Kansas City and was one of quarterback Patrick Mahomes' favorite targets.\n\nA reunion would make a ton of sense, especially after the Chiefs just missed the postseason for the first time since before either Hill or Mahomes debuted. The Chiefs struggled to establish a deep-ball threat this season, and an ancient Travis Kelce led the team in receiving.\n\nBringing Hill back into the fold immediately gives Mahomes an established weapon who, if he's 100%, can burn defensive backs better than almost anyone. And their familiarity should help him, figuratively and literally, hit the ground running in September and beyond.\n\nWhile the Chiefs are the logical landing spot based on \"narrative,\" the Buffalo Bills need a big-time receiver just as much. Quarterback Josh Allen relied more heavily on his tight ends in 2025, and giving him another option alongside top WR Khalil Shakir (who led the team with 72 receptions, while Dalton Kincaid was next with 39) would solve a glaring issue and take some of the pressure off.\n\nThe Bills' window isn't closed, but they did move on from head coach Sean McDermott this offseason, showing a desperation to get over the hump from \"great regular season team\" to \"legitimate Super Bowl contender.\" Hill would be a major upgrade.\n\nFresh off a disappointing showing in the Super Bowl, could the New England Patriots target Hill? Stefon Diggs is a $26.5-million cap hit next season, and is already being bandied about as a potential cut candidate.\n\nIt's doubtful that the Pats would employ both Diggs and Hill for a variety of reasons — both have had character and legal issues in recent years — and it may not make a lot of sense to replace Diggs with Hill, especially if the latter has questions about his health in the wake of his ACL tear and dislocated knee.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens committed to quarterback Lamar Jackson in moving on from head coach John Harbaugh, and bolstering the wide receiver corps may be a way to kickstart a new era.\n\nHe would help form a formidable duo with Zay Flowers, who had nearly 800 more receiving yards than his closest teammate in 2025. Veteran DeAndre Hopkins is a free agent, and Hill would be a significant upgrade at their respective points in their careers.\n\nFinally, this is an interesting option after Hill's former Miami Dolphins head coach, Mike McDaniel, was hired to serve as Jim Harbaugh's offensive coordinator. When Miami's offense was at its best before Tua Tagovailoa's concussions, the Dolphins looked virtually unstoppable.\n\nAssuming there's no bad blood, giving Justin Herbert a target of this caliber may unlock another level for the Los Angeles Chargers quarterback.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here and view our best betting sites or check out our top sportsbook promos.",

    "description": "The Cardinals get help on the EDGE, at tackle and at cornerback. They miss out on QB Ty Simpson.",
    "fullText": "It is another mock draft weekend. Every weekend until the actual 2026 NFL draft, we will run simulations for the Arizona Cardinals. Because compensatory picks have not been announced yet, exact Day 3 picks are still uncertain, so this mock draft simulation is only three rounds.\n\nIn this mock draft, using Pro Football Network's simulator, the idea was to try and make it match with what NFL.com draft analyst Daniel Jeremiah said about the Cardinals. They could be in the mix for an edge rusher, and quarterback Ty Simpson would make sense in the second round.\n\nThe Simpson pick didn't happen, though.\n\nHere are the results of the three-round mock draft.\n\nThe Cardinals have not drafted a player outside the Big Ten or SEC in the first two rounds of the draft in three drafts under general manager Monti Ossenfort. Bailey can be the exception. OhiO State's Arvell Reese is on the board, and he woudl fit the profile, but Bailey is a standard, true edge rusher, and the Cardinals simply need help there. Josh Sweat had 12 sacks, and no one else made any sort of impact, and Sweat made no impact on any fourth quarter.\n\nBailey will make Sweat better, and Sweat's presence will be great for Bailey.\n\nWe go back to the SEC. The Cardinals need a right tackle, and Proctor is a monster at 6-6, 369 pounds.\n\nHe fills that void in a large way.\n\nWhy couldn't it be Alabama QB Ty Simpson? He was drafted 15th in this simulation.\n\nAnother cornerback? Well, yes, because the Cardinals' corners can't stay healthy. Neal would pair nicely with Will Johnson with both of their size. Johnson is 6-2. So is Neal.\n\nSo the Cardinals add defensive help and get a bookend tackle. That's not a bad result.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "description": "Let's run through some possible trade scenarios.",
    "fullText": "As the 2026 NFL offseason nears, it's worth looking at some possible trade scenarios for some of the league's top players. Who might get dealt around March's kickoff to the new NFL year?\n\nIn a first of three parts, we've imagined some possible NFL trades featuring some of the biggest names in the league. Don't worry; we hit the ground running with some real blockbusters involving elite talent.\n\nWe'll have 10 more trade ideas coming your way in the time to come, but it'll be good to get started off on the right foot. Who might wind up elsewhere? What would the trade packages look like? Inquire within!\n\nWill Crosby actually be dealt? Your guess is as good as mine, but Mike Vrabel has to be banging the tables to bring in the ace pass-rusher. The Patriots defense having that kind of edge rusher to wreak havoc would go such a long way to complement the tight secondary coverage. While Crosby can't protect Drake Maye's blindside, he'd make the quarterback's life easier by adding more balance to the other side of the ball. If the Patriots can improve their pass-rush with Crosby, they'll be better than they were in 2025. It'd be a slam-dunk to bolster a Super Bowl contender into a new league altogether on defense. In return, the Raiders could get a nice package of picks and a solid addition to the edge room in Anfernee Jennings to at least take a little of the bite out of trading away Crosby.\n\nTRADE PACKAGE: Crosby to New England for a 2026 first-round pick, a 2027 second-round pick and Jennings\n\nThe Titans desperately need to get quarterback Cam Ward a field-stretching wide receiver to take his game to the next level. Tennessee, flushed with cap space, could make Moore an integral part of the Titans' passing game without sending away too much draft compensation. With wide receiver Calvin Ridley a very possible cut candidate, the Titans could really use a veteran in the room like Moore. Ward being able to air it out a bit more would be huge for his development; Moore could also use a fresh start after getting a decrease in targets with Ben Johnson. Let's say the Titans send a third-round pick back to Chicago to get this done; that feels reasonable for both sides.\n\nTRADE PACKAGE: Moore to Tennessee for a 2026 third-round pick\n\nThe Vikings desperately need to undo the Sam Darnold decision. Watching Darnold win a Super Bowl with Seattle has to burn like the heat of a thousand suns for Minnesota fans who watched J.J. McCarthy struggle in his first full year as a starter. McCarthy's future already feels in flux as a Viking, and Minnesota's contention window may not support his clear need for more development. Enter Mac Jones. The 49ers can sleep easy with Jones as their backup to Brock Purdy, but could Minnesota pry Jones away by throwing McCarthy into the trade package? Perhaps Kyle Shanahan would be intrigued by the idea of developing McCarthy behind Purdy as a more long-term insurance plan. Jones proved in 2025 that he could be a decent starter in the right system. Swapping out Shanahan for Kevin O'Connell could keep the positive streak going for the former Patriots first-round pick. McCarthy could step back into the shadows to develop under Shanahan's watch, and Jones could start for a playoff-ready roster. Win-win?\n\nTRADE PACKAGE: Jones to Minnesota for McCarthy, a 2026 sixth-round pick and a 2027 conditional third-round pick\n\nBrown's time with Philadelphia feels tenuous at best. The incredibly talented wideout helped bring a Super Bowl to the City of Brotherly Love, but an uneven 2025 campaign leans toward both sides needing a clean break. Eagles general manager Howie Roseman won't trade Brown for nothing, but we think it's very possible he's sent elsewhere. Where would he go? How about Las Vegas? Presumed Raiders rookie quarterback Fernando Mendoza will need a strong infrastructure to grow with, and Brown could instantly solve the team's wide receiver woes. A trio of Brown, tight end Brock Bowers and running back Ashton Jeanty could skyrocket Mendoza's development and give new coach Klint Kubiak plenty to work with in his first year as a head coach. Let's say a package of draft picks and a potential Dallas Goedert replacement convinces Roseman to trade Brown before the league year gets going.\n\nTRADE PACKAGE: Brown and a 2027 seventh-round pick to Las Vegas for a 2026 second-round pick, a 2027 fifth-round pick and tight end Michael Mayer\n\nThomas still has sky-high potential in the NFL, even if his future with the Jacksonville Jaguars is in flux. He's only TK and has so much football ahead of him. If he hits with the right team, the payoff could be enormous for both sides... and Thomas is still on a rookie deal. Jacksonville could probably get a really nice return on Thomas, too. Where might he go? How about the Commanders? Washington desperately needs more pop in the passing game to keep quarterback Jayden Daniels from scrambling too much. The team's soaring 2024 crashed and burned in 2025, so a rebound will be vital for all parties to keep their seats from getting hot. Thomas could replace Deebo Samuel as wide out Terry McLaurin's running mate and give Washington a potentially lethal deep threat for Daniels. Jacksonville could get a good draft pick and a young wideout from Washington in return and send Thomas to the NFC.\n\nTRADE PACKAGE: Thomas to Washington for a conditional 2027 second-round pick and WR Jaylin Lane\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: NFL 2026 trade scenarios, Part 1: Who deals for Maxx Crosby?!",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk’s supposed interest in buying the Seattle Seahawks has been trending on social media.\n\nThe speculation gained traction after a viral post claimed the billionaire was interested in purchasing the NFL franchise from the Estate of Paul G. Allen.\n\nHowever, the real story centres on the Seahawks’ formal sale process rather than unverified fan conjecture.\n\nIn a post widely shared across platforms, as posted by TheNFLDrop, it was claimed, “Elon Musk says he is interested in purchasing the Seattle Seahawks from the Estate of Paul G. Allen.\n\n“Musk has a net worth of $850 billion, and the Seahawks are looking to sell for over $10 billion.”\n\nThat post mixed true elements, namely that the Seahawks are entering the market, with speculation about Musk’s intentions that is not supported by credible reporting.\n\nNo major sports news outlet has confirmed Musk is in advanced talks or formally pursuing the franchise. Ideas about Musk as a suitor remain fan discussion rather than a verified fact.\n\nIt is also worth noting that reported net worth figures for individuals like Musk often vary significantly over time and are routinely updated by financial outlets, not fixed figures reported by NFL sources.\n\nWhat is verified is that the Seattle Seahawks are being put up for sale by the Paul G.

    "title": "NFL combine is awash with questions about veterans, not rookies. They range from Lamar Jackson to Maxx Crosby",
    "description": "While the veteran news and ramp up to free agency will cast a long shadow in Indianapolis, it won't eliminate a litany of prospect-related storylines that will get rolling once workouts begin.",
    "fullText": "Maybe it’s the quarterback chaos or the landslide of head coaching changes. Or because it’s late February and many of the NFL’s personnel departments already seem satisfied that the No. 1 overall pick in the draft is in the barn. Or maybe it’s because the 2025 season produced a wildly unexpected Super Bowl between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots, and an even more unexpected Super Bowl quarterback winner in Sam Darnold.\n\nWhatever the driving force, it’s thrusting the usual sideshow of the NFL scouting combine — trade rumors, free-agency buzz and clandestine general manager meetings — into the middle of the main stage. And with that, the college players who are taking their next big step toward draft positioning have become a subplot.\n\n“It’s going to be a wild offseason and it’s going to start next week [at the combine],” one prominent NFL agent said this week. “There’s so much more than usual with different veteran stuff compared to how guys are going to work out — and we have a good class of guys [in the draft]. All the quarterback things to figure out, some of the [veteran] defensive players — some of the young players that could be traded with the staff changes — there’s going to be a lot going on. …\n\n“I see you guys talking about storylines — when was the last time anyone checked in on what’s going on with Lamar Jackson [and the Baltimore Ravens]? It’s like that situation has gotten lost in all this noise. That’s how crazy next week is going to be, though.”\n\nIn fairness, Jackson’s potential extension deadline — spoken into existence by Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti in January — has been a prominent story over the past month. Indeed, it will crank up next week, with the quarterback and franchise having been in a contract talks window for several weeks by the time Ravens new head coach Jesse Minter and general manager Eric DeCosta meet with the media in Indianapolis. It’s expected there will be some kind of temperature gauge coming out of the combine, with the front office and ownership wanting to sign an extension with Jackson and lower his $74.5 million salary cap hit in 2026.\n\nOf course, Jackson is only one of multiple pressing maneuvers — or non-maneuvers — heading into the combine that will certainly drain some of the daily news thunder from draft prospects’ workouts. Among the prominent:\n\nWho will be getting the franchise tag applied to them before free agency, with the biggest potential name being Dallas Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens. As it stands, Dallas is expected to tag Pickens prior to the March 3 deadline and then either attempt to retain him or try to engage in a sign-and-trade scenario. With Pickens wanting to get to free agency and a likely $35 million average salary per season, there will likely be sparks in a tag scenario.\n\nPotential veteran trades, including Las Vegas Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby, Philadelphia Eagles wideout A.J. Brown, Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray and others. Throw in some young players who might get a call or two just to see if they are available on the trade market, including Buffalo Bills wideout Keon Coleman, Jacksonville Jaguars wideout Brian Thomas Jr., Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson and Minnesota Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy.\n\nThe future of Aaron Rodgers will be a pressing question for the Pittsburgh Steelers — at least as it pertains to the organization’s other options and what kind of timeline there would be for a Rodgers decision. It’s possible we exit the combine under the presumption that the Steelers are going to move forward and try to find their future QB, which would shift the Rodgers conversation back to the Vikings, whom he was interested in before landing in Pittsburgh last offseason.\n\nAnd finally, one very big nugget that has yet to be developed: How much interest there will be in Malik Willis in free agency and what the money could ultimately look like. The ballpark speculation in the agent community is some kind of two-year deal averaging $30 to $35 million a season with $40 to $45 million guaranteed. That would put Willis in position to go back to the table next offseason and negotiate a longer term deal that tacks on to the end of 2027 and extends his guaranteed money out into a three-year window through the 2028 season. There are varying opinions on the numbers and structure, not to mention the potential interest. Willis feels like the first big quarterback domino that has to fall in March to trigger a larger migration. If he were to land in Pittsburgh, that then puts Rodgers — if he still wants to play — onto the market for the Vikings or any other suitors. And once Willis is off the board, the teams that ultimately don’t have him as an option will then have to reassess.\n\nThere’s a sliding scale of a trade likelihood for all these players. Crosby’s situation with the Raiders, from what Yahoo Sports has been told by league sources familiar with their talks, is still at a standstill — but also not unrepairable. Part of the Raiders’ motivation is to see what Crosby’s trade market looks like and also where he is at with the franchise in a new phase of a rebuild. The market will likely be the driving force here. If there is a solid offer of draft picks on the table, a trade seems more likely than not.\n\nThe same goes for Brown and the Eagles, although it remains to be seen what general manager Howie Roseman could engineer to fill his No. 1 wide receiver spot if there is ultimately an attractive offer available for Brown. It’s highly unlikely the Eagles would move Brown and not have another player in the mix, so the combine’s wide receiver workouts and other available players at the position could factor.\n\nThe Murray and Tagovailoa process is going to depend on suitors and money. Right now there are zero indications of an appetite to take on either Tagovailoa or Murray’s remaining contract in a trade, let alone surrender any meaningful draft assets to make him a starter. That could change if the QB shuffling doesn’t break right for some teams and desperation enters the scenario. Lest anyone forget, there was a market (albeit diminishing) for Russell Wilson the past two offseasons. So there can certainly be a market for Tagovailoa or Murray if a situation gets bad enough.\n\nAs for the young players, Coleman seems likeliest to be traded, given the comments of Bills owner Terry Pegula that essentially branded him as not being the front office’s draft choice. Unfortunately for Buffalo, Coleman’s trade value will be nothing more than a late pick at this stage. Even with his youth.\n\nThomas, Richardson and McCarthy are not expected to be officially on the trade block, but all three could garner some interest and calls. Thomas seems less likely to be dealt with the Jaguars moving Travis Hunter primarily to cornerback. McCarthy won’t be dealt unless the Vikings are presented with a quarterback option that effectively renders any chance of him having a future as moot. And Richardson doesn’t have much of a market, and will have only one year left on his rookie deal once his fifth-year option is ultimately declined. That doesn’t leave much room to develop him for any interested franchise. But again, we don’t know how desperate the quarterback field gets.\n\nThat’s a lot of veteran questions and potential developments that will hang over the primary reason teams are in Indianapolis next week: To begin laying down the foundations of their draft boards for April’s selection process in Pittsburgh. While the veteran news and ramp up to free agency will cast a long shadow in Indianapolis, it won’t eliminate a litany of prospect-related storylines that will get rolling once workouts begin.\n\nHere’s a look at some of those that will be worthy of watching.\n\nWhile it’s not expected to be as top-heavy as the 2024 wide receiver class — which saw seven first-round picks at the position — the wideouts are considered a spot that is going to have depth and offer needy teams quality options potentially into the third round. The general consensus at this point is that four to five receivers could go in the first round. Most of the intrigue will be how the top of the class sorts itself between the trio of Ohio State’s Carnell Tate, Arizona State’s Jordyn Tyson and USC’s Makai Lemon.\n\n“I think you could see some [changes in that trio] between interviews, measurements and whatever work gets done,” one NFC talent evaluator said. “The medicals, too — definitely the medical for Tyson. … And it depends how you want to use them in your scheme. Lemon, some teams might not like the size but others might love the versatility and how he catches it. How fast will Tyson run and some of the speed and agility things with Tate will be important. They’re all good players, but there’s definitely some of the [Travis] Hunter, [Tetairoa] McMillan, [Emeka] Egbuka [conversations from 2025] because they’re not all similar players.”\n\nAs it stands, Tate appears to stand out among talent evaluators as the most “clean” player from the threesome, in terms of the total package of consistency, health, size and production. But there’s definitely curiosity about what his pure speed and agility will look like, especially alongside Lemon and Tyson. Some of those questions will be answered — if all three actually do full workouts at the combine, which isn’t guaranteed. Beyond that trio, there will definitely be some gravity toward the next tier of WRs in Washington’s Denzel Boston, Tennessee’s Chris Brazzell II and Notre Dame’s Malachi Fields, who all bring prototypical “X” receiver size to the table. The Bills will be an interesting team to watch with that group.\n\nFor only the second time in 13 years, we could end up seeing only one quarterback selected in the first round. With the Las Vegas Raiders expected to take Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza with the No. 1 pick, it’s also trending toward Mendoza passing on everything at the combine and opening the floor for the rest of the class. That will be a solid opportunity for multiple players, including Alabama’s Ty Simpson, Penn State’s Drew Allar, Miami’s Carson Beck, LSU’s Garrett Nussmeier and others.\n\nIt’s simply not a great class when it comes to star power (that will come in 2027), but there could be a bit of developmental depth with some strong showings.\n\nEven with the thin class, there is still plenty of quarterback need across the league — and that will point plenty of eyes in the direction of Simpson. He was a prospect with some solid draft heat near the midpoint of the college season, but red flags began to get raised as he got knocked around and turned the ball over later in the schedule and then suffered a rib injury that knocked him out of the College Football Playoff. Right now he’s likely to land in the late first to mid-second round range, somewhat similar to how teams were looking at Bo Nix in 2024, and Jaxson Dart and Tyler Shough last year. If Simpson can wow teams in interviews and put up a good workout, he can build momentum to move up the board and get a QB-needy team to expend a first-round pick on him. Already, you hear his name connected a lot to the Los Angeles Rams, who have the 13th and 29th overall picks.\n\nAs for the rest of the pack, it’s unclear what Allar will be able to do at the combine due to an ankle injury that ended his 2025 season. He’s the player with the size and easy arm strength, so he’ll draw in someone believing they can home his considerable talent into consistent results. Same goes for Beck, who also has size and arm, but also some leadership and love-for-the-game questions that teams want to pick at in interviews. Not to mention some bad turnovers in important spots, going all the way back to his time at Georgia. Then there’s Nussmeier, who some evaluators once believed could develop into a first-round pick, maybe even a solidly high one, before injuries derailed much of his 2025 college season. He’ll be another player who draws plenty of eyeballs.\n\nIt’s a loaded class with edge players, with an onslaught at that position expected to end up packing the first round. While there’s still a lot of work ahead, it wouldn’t be surprising to see as many as eight edge rushers come off the board in the first 32 picks. A lot of the attention will go to potential top-10 picks in Texas Tech’s David Bailey, Ohio State’s Arvell Reese and Miami’s Rueben Bain Jr. But there will be a battle to figure out the stack after that trio, with players like Auburn’s Keldric Faulk, Missouri’s Zion Young and Miami’s Akheem Mesidor battling it out. Young is a player to keep an eye on. He had a great week of practice at the Senior Bowl and ended up as the game’s defensive MVP, giving him a lot of buzz coming into the combine. But top to bottom it’s going to be great draft for teams that need edge players and defensive line talent in general.\n\n“It might be one of the deepest [edge] classes ever, especially through the top 50, 60 guys [in the entire draft],” an AFC general manager concluded. “There’s all types of skill sets and body types that fit different needs, but the talent in general just very, very good. There’s really not a Myles Garrett or Nick Bosa, but there’s a half dozen guys who could become just good, core second-contract players for teams.”\n\nBeyond the defensive line, there’s strength in the class of safeties and cornerbacks as well, with as many as a half dozen or more picks in the secondary likely to land in Round 1. And while safety isn’t traditionally a position that sees multiple first-round selections, this will almost certainly be one of those years, with Ohio State’s Caleb Downs, Toledo’s Emmanuel McNeil-Warren and Oregon’s Dillon Thieneman all having the profile to possibly land in the first half of the first round. That just doesn’t happen. Downs in particular will be very intriguing. His résumé is the kind that he’d be an easy top-five pick if he played at a more premium defensive position — and there were times that some evaluators believed he could even be worth that kind of juice in this draft. The overall strength of the defensive class at premium positions is likely to push him down the board, but it’s certainly not lost on front offices that so many of the NFL’s best defenses now feature a dynamic safety like Downs. That could cement Downs higher on teams boards by April.\n\nThe next running back after Notre Dame’s Jeremiyah Love is going to be an interesting development to watch. Overall, the class isn’t amazing and it’s going to be dinged a bit by the free-agent class being so strong. There’s no doubt that some teams want to see what Love’s backup for the Fighting Irish, Jadarian Price, does in the workouts. As much as game tape matters, Price could have transferred elsewhere for the 2025 college football season and doubled his touches while positioning himself to challenge Love as this year’s top running back. Now he comes into the draft with less wear and tear but also some curiosity about whether he can be a centerpiece starter and also catch the ball consistently out of the backfield. His workouts will matter, especially as it pertains to his receiving ability. If he can showcase that and put up the type of athletic numbers that some think he can, there will likely be more Alvin Kamara comparisons to follow. As of now, I’m not sure how that framing works without the receiving end of his game being more proven.\n\nOregon tight end Kenyon Sadiq is going to be interesting. Some evaluators like him as almost a hybrid running back/wide receiver if he fits into the right scheme. Others see him as a plus-level athlete whose “expected” 6-foot-2, 240-pound size is going to make him a bit of a tweener — and not in a good way — in the NFL. There’s curiosity about Sadiq’s true height and weight and what his workouts look like. There’s little doubt he has mismatch potential and maybe some considerable ceiling with the right coach and scheme, but some evaluators don’t see him as the kind of tight end who can fit in a lot of different places and be on the field at the rate of a multitude of TEs from last year’s draft. He can’t be compared realistically to the bigger bodied guys like Colston Loveland and Tyler Warren. And his overall consistency of college production wasn’t in the realm of Brock Bowers going into the 2024 draft. Who is the realistic comparable at the NFL level to Sadiq and what coach can draw that unique talent out of him?",

    "fullText": "Tyler Linderbaum might be at the top of the New York Giants’ NFL free agency wish list as they aim to upgrade in the trenches. Getting him, though, is not going to be easy. “Everybody” wants Linderbaum, according to NFL Network draft analyst Daniel Jeremiah.\n\n“I love my job, but if I could switch jobs for just the next couple months I’d want to be Tyler Linderbaum’s agent,” Jeremiah said Thursday on a pre-NFL Scouting Combine call with media. ‘Everybody that I talk to seems to be in on Tyler Linderbaum. It sounds like he’s going to have a robust market.“\n\nLinderbaum, of course, was the center for Giants coach John Harbaugh with the Baltimore Ravens for the past four years. The 25th pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, Linderbaum was named to the Pro Bowl in each of his last three seasons.\n\nEntering his age 26 season, Linderbaum is about to be a very rich young man. Creed Humphrey of the Kansas City Chiefs is the league’s highest-paid center. He signed a four-year, $72 million contract, an average of $18 million per year.\n\nLinderbaum’s contract, especially with a “robust market,” figures to equal or exceed that figure.\n\nThe Ravens are hoping to keep Linderbaum in Baltimore.\n\n“We got some work to do on Tyler Linderbaum’s contract,” DeCosta said on ‘The Inner Circle Podcast.’ “We strongly hope to have him back. He’s a great player for us and a great leader.”\n\nDo the Giants “need” Linderbaum badly enough to be willing to reset the center market financially? Perhaps not. John Michael Schmitz is a capable center who has improved in each of his first three seasons.\n\nLinderbaum, though, would be an upgrade. Harbaugh, who has said consistently that continuing to upgrade the talent on both the offensive and defensive lines is a must for the Giants, might be willing to do whatever it takes to get the player who orchestrated his offensive line in Baltimore.\n\nIs Linderbaum worth the biggest contract ever given to a center, Giants fans?",

    "fullText": "The NFL Combine is less than a week away. With the NFL world descending on Lucas Oil Stadium for the annual meat market, who are the prospects that could make a big impression in the biggest job interview of their lives? And could any be on the radar of the Jacksonville Jaguars? Let’s take a look:\n\nJonah Coleman is RB2 in the class and it's not close based on film + statistics:\n\n– Creative when play shuts down\n– Vision, feet, movement in sync\n– Best RB after contact in class\n\nHe's very good at pressing the LOS.\n\nCreative runner that turns a lot of these type of plays into… pic.twitter.com/wsR0QKU60W\n\n— Snoog's Fantasy HQ (@FFSnoog) February 13, 2026\n\nWith the combine focusing on raw measurables, Jonah Coleman has every opportunity to push himself into the same tier as Jeremiyah Love next week. Coleman isn’t expected to be the quickest running back in the room; he’s a short, dense ‘bowling ball’ style back whose physical style of running has made him a consistent contributor for the Huskies over three seasons. What Coleman needs to show is that he’s fast enough, and a 4.5 second forty time at his size and play strength will certainly turn heads.\n\nWith Travis Etienne’s future in Jacksonville still unsure, running back may be a target position for the Jaguars in the draft. Coleman’s 4.29 yards after contact average (in the 97th percentile at his position) will appeal to James Gladstone, whose selection of Bhayshul Tuten last year shows his penchant for pinball wizards in the backfield.\n\nMississippi State WR Brenen Thompson beating both of the TCU corners on double moves.\n\nHe's definitely gonna fly next week in Indy. pic.twitter.com/fOePdNM99c\n\n— Derrick (@Steelers_DB) February 20, 2026\n\nLife in Starkville has been tough the past few seasons. But wide receiver Brenen Thompson made a wise decision leaving Oklahoma for Mississippi State last year, enjoying a breakout campaign that saw him break 1,000 yards receiving. Key to that production was his unparalleled speed, with many expecting him to challenge Matthew Golden’s 4.29 second forty from last season. Thompson’s average depth of target (aDOT) last season was an outrageous 18.4 yards – for context, the NFL average is around 11.0.\n\nAt 5’9” and 170lbs, there’ll be concerns about Thompson’s longevity in the NFL. But athleticism grabs the headlines at the combine. I’m not sure if it’s a profile the Jaguars front office will be interested in, but with rumors persisting about Brian Thomas being traded, adding to the position group is a distinct possibility.\n\nThe right NFL OL coach is going to turn Arizona State's Max Iheanachor into a Pro Bowler. pic.twitter.com/ITAvB6DWci\n\n— Tyler Brooke (@TylerDBrooke) February 5, 2026\n\nIf you’re looking for a physical freak with unreasonable athleticism, Iheanachor might be your guy. Starring at the Senior Bowl, the former Sun Devil has already elevated his stock through the early part of draft season. And if scouts want to go and check the tape, they’ll see a prospect who allowed zero sacks on almost 500 pass-blocking snaps in 2025.\n\nStanding at 6’6”, weighing 330lbs and having ludicrous 34.5” arms, Iheanachor is a mountain of a man. But it’s a mountain that can move, with him expected to run somewhere in the region of a 5.15 second forty and show off his lateral agility in the other tests. Iheanachor might have pushed himself into day one contention, but if he’s still there on Friday, could the Jags be interested in bolstering their offensive line?\n\n#SouthCarolina CB Brandon Cisse is one of the best athletes in the 2026 drafts CB class.\n\nTwitched up defender with elite speed and fluidity, very sticky in man coverage and has a ton of versatility. Top-50 player on my Big Board. pic.twitter.com/Vq1bmHJ97X\n\n— Andy (@AndyyNFL) December 12, 2025\n\nThe secondary is a big need for the Jaguars this offseason, and I would be surprised if they didn’t at least partially address it in free agency. But should they be looking for someone who can start on the outside as a rookie, then perhaps Brandon Cisse is on their radar…\n\nCisse has elite athleticism across the board; expectations of a forty inch vertical jump and a sub-four second 20-yard shuttle demonstrate his explosiveness. At approximately 6’0” and 195lbs he’s got the measurables, and he showed a big improvement on his career numbers during his one year as a Gamecock. 19 solo tackles tells you he can be left on an island, and his proficiency in press man coverage could appeal to Gladstone. With his stock about to explode, it would likely take a trade back into the first round to make him a Jaguar.\n\nOne thing about Red Murdock (#2) is that he'll light a mf up pic.twitter.com/Lfyi2jv3aI\n\n— JP Acosta (@acosta32_jp) February 13, 2026\n\nOne of the coolest names in the draft also belongs to one of the most productive players in this year’s class. Red Murdock has dominated for the Bulls the last two seasons, racking up 298 tackles, 30 TFL’s and seven sacks during that time. Murdock is expected to perform extremely well in the shuttle and mirror drills at the combine, whose monstrous stats have often been attributed to his sideline to sideline speed and read-and-chase ability.\n\nIf Devin Lloyd leaves town during free agency, a huge chunk of the Jaguars’ turnovers from last season leaves with him. In that regard Murdock could be the perfect replacement; the former Buffalo linebacker set an FBS record with 17 career forced fumbles, all in the past three seasons. Murdock is likely to still be on the board on Day 3, even with a strong performance in Indy. Value like that might be too hard for this front office to ignore.",

To preview this important pre-draft event, we will be taking a position-by-position look at which prospects were invited and the level of need that the Indianapolis Colts have at each spot.\n\nThe NFL combine is held at Lucas Oil Stadium and is an opportunity for the top NFL draft prospects in this year’s class to go through measurements and various on-field drills, some of which are specific to their position group, and others measure the player’s overall athleticism.\n\nFor NFL teams, this event is another data point for them as they build out their draft profiles and big boards. However, it’s a significant data point, with players potentially flying up and down draft boards depending on how they perform.\n\nIn addition to the on-field drills, teams also get the opportunity to meet with players one-on-one as well, which is another important part of the evaluation process as they get to know them both on and off the field.\n\nUp next in our preview are the tight ends.\n\nWith Warren leading the way, the Colts are positioned well here. However, as you can see by the current roster, depth is needed. Specifically, another blocking presence is needed to pair with Warren. Shane Steichen uses his fair share of two tight end sets.\n\nMallory provides more of a pass-catching presence and has struggled to earn playing time. The Colts could look to bring back Alie-Cox and/or Ogletree to fill that blocking-specific role. Neither will break the salary cap bank.\n\nThen, of course, the draft is an option as well, if GM Chris Ballard wants to find a longer-term option to join Warren.\n\nJohn Michael Gyllenborg, Wyoming\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: 2026 NFL combine preview: Which tight ends were invited?",

    "fullText": "The NFL combine begins soon, running from Feb. 23 to March 2. To preview this important pre-draft event, we will be taking a position-by-position look at which prospects were invited and the level of need that the Indianapolis Colts have at each spot.\n\nThe NFL combine is held at Lucas Oil Stadium and is an opportunity for the top NFL draft prospects in this year’s class to go through measurements and various on-field drills, some of which are specific to their position group, and others measure the player’s overall athleticism.\n\nFor NFL teams, this event is another data point for them as they build out their draft profiles and big boards. However, it’s a significant data point, with players potentially flying up and down draft boards depending on how they perform.\n\nIn addition to the on-field drills, teams also get the opportunity to meet with players one-on-one as well, which is another important part of the evaluation process as they get to know them both on and off the field.\n\nTaylor is still under contract through 2026, so the need remains relatively low. With Taylor still just 27 years old, he could be a potential contract extension candidate this offseason.\n\nHowever, while the need at running back may not be high, the Colts could still make an addition here. Adding an inexpensive veteran option in free agency or a mid to late round pick in the draft to bolster the depth and competition behind Taylor could be on Chris Ballard's radar.\n\nBentley was on the practice squad last season, and Giddens was often inactive, still needing to develop parts of his game, particularly in pass protection.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: Indianapolis Colts' 2026 NFL combine preview: running backs",

    "description": "Should the Tennessee Titans re-sign OT Oli Udoh? Previewing NFL Free Agency for GM Mike Borgonzi.",
    "fullText": "Welcome to Music City Miracles’ Tennessee Titans 2026 NFL Free Agency Primer! The negotiating window period begins on March 9th, but the Titans are able to re-sign their own free agents before then. General manager Mike Borgonzi is equipped with more than $100 million in cap space and will collaborate with new head coach Robert Saleh on their shared vision for the 2026 Titans.\n\nThe Titans are currently scheduled to possess 29 free agents (19 unrestricted), including several key starters and role players. Over the next few weeks, we’ll take an in-depth look at each free agent and provide arguments for why the Titans should, or shouldn’t re-sign that player. We’ll also offer our final verdict and a prediction to go along with our analysis.\n\nToday, we’re analyzing offensive tackle Oli Udoh.\n\nUdoh ended up playing a valuable swing role for the Titans behind starters JC Latham and Dan Moore Jr. As far as backup tackles go, he performed reasonably well. Pro Football Focus assigned identical overall and pass-blocking grades of 55.0. The Titans’ offense rarely suffered specifically because Udoh was in the lineup.\n\nPFF also credited Udoh with allowing 19 pressures, three sacks, and being whistled for six penalties. That’s a fair amount of negative plays for a tackle who earned just 274 reps at left and right tackle. Perhaps the Titans could identify a more suitable reserve tackle in free agency.\n\nSpotrac does not have a projected contract for Udoh. He signed a one-year, $1,170,000 million contract with the Titans last offseason. An extension would probably be in a similar range, maybe with a slight raise in pay.\n\nThe Titans should re-sign Udoh. His level of play improved as the campaign progressed forward. Udoh wasn’t a drive-killer when he entered games, and that’s the realistic expectation for reserve tackles. The former Elon standout was even better than recent starters at tackle for the Titans like Dennis Daley, Nicholas Petit-Frere, and Andre Dillard.\n\nThe Titans re-sign Udoh to another one-year contract.",

    "fullText": "The NFL is inching toward the 2026 NFL Combine, so you better believe mock drafts are flying all over the place. And with the Minnesota Vikings holding the 18th overall pick, NFL.com’s Daniel Jeremiah believes Kevin O’Connell and Brian Flores will scoop a Harrison Smith replacement: Oregon safety Dillon Thieneman.\n\nNFL.com ties Minnesota to Thieneman as the Smith succession plan, signaling a 2026 secondary transition.\n\nIt’s not yet clear whether Smith will retire, but if so, Thieneman might have the juice to fill his shoes.\n\nAnother mock draft for the Vikings — more defense.\n\nJeremiah: Thieneman to Vikings at No. 18\n\nBecause Lewis Cine didn’t pan out and the fact that Smith may indeed retire soon, Minnesota will need a safety for the long haul. Jeremiah thinks Thieneman is the right guy.\n\nHe wrote Tuesday, “After studying Thieneman’s impressive 2025 tape at Oregon, I went back and watched the film from his career at Purdue, where he played in 2023 and ’24. His range and playmaking skills were evident back then, too. He would be an excellent replacement for Harrison Smith.”\n\nJeremiah continued the defensive trend for the Vikings’ spot in mock drafts. Most editions have the club selecting a defensive back or defensive lineman.\n\nThieneman is 6’0 and 200 pounds and will turn 22 in August. He’s known for his versatility at safety, which sounds like a page from the Smith playbook. His ball-tracking is elite for a rookie prospect, and he is known for high football IQ. NFL.com recently compared him to Jevon Holland, a safety for the New York Giants.\n\nA to Z Sports‘ Rob Gregson on Thieneman: “You turn on three years’ worth of tape from Thieneman, and it just gets better and better. After bursting on to the scene as a true freshman in 2023, where he recorded six interceptions, Thieneman then led the Big-10 in tackles in 2024, before doing a little bit of everything for the Ducks in 2025.”\n\n“You’re betting on instincts and explosion with Thieneman. He may not be elite laterally and challenged in terms of his man coverage projection, but if you need a player who can play the high post, poach the middle as a robber, and align as a box safety for a plus one help in the run game, Thieneman is your guy.”\n\nNFL.com’s Lance Zierlein: “Savvy three-year starter with NFL size, speed and alignment versatility. Thieneman is an extension of his defensive coordinator, aligning and adjusting the secondary to motion and pre-snap shifts. He’s an instinctive, rangy safety who can roll down into big nickel or robber positioning.”\n\n“He has a good feel for play design and route concepts in zone but has average change of direction to match breaks in man. He’s not a big thumper near the line, but he rushes into the action with a relentless pursuit that should allow him to keep stacking high scores in the tackle columns. Thieneman checks important boxes for teams looking to add versatile playmakers in the secondary.”\n\nThe 2026 Safeties + a Smith Verdict\n\nIf one pretends that Smith will indeed retire, Minnesota’s safety group would look like this in 2026 with Thieneman:\n\nIt’s also worth noting that, as of February 18th, there’s been no official retirement announcement from Smith, which is a bit odd. He can still call it quits, but with each day that passes, Smith is more likely to return for Year No. 15, especially with Flores back in the saddle as the defensive coordinator.\n\nThieneman ranks No. 37 on the Consensus Big Board at the time of this article’s publication. He might be a 2nd-Round commodity. If the Vikings don’t reach and pick him at No. 18, the team’s draftboard might resemble this, based on the best player available and long-term roster need:\n\nEmmanuel McNeil-Warren (S, Toledo)\n\nKayden McDonald (DT, Ohio State)\n\nJordyn Tyson (WR, Arizona State)\n\nThe NFL draft is about nine weeks away. Minnesota has at least nine picks line up this cycle — four more than last year, when the club had a skimpy cupboard due to the expensive Dallas Turner trade in 2024.",

    "fullText": "Earlier this year, domestic violence allegations against Chiefs receiver Rashee Rice surfaced on Instagram. New allegations have emerged against Rice in a lawsuit that was initiated earlier this week.\n\nVia James Newell of The Athletic, the civil complaint filed Monday in Dallas County District Court includes the following contentions: \"Defendant Rashee Rice and Plaintiff Dacoda Jones lived together. Following an escalation in violent behavior, in December, 2023, Defendant Rashee Rice strangled Plaintiff Dacoda Joans [sic] at their shared home in Victory Park, Texas. Defendant Rashee Rice continued to repeatedly assaulted Dacoda Jones over the course of their relationship through July, 2025. Defendant Rice has grabbed, choked, strangled, pushed, thrown, scratched, hit, and headbutted Ms. Jones, as well as hit her with inanimate objects. Additionally, he has engaged in other violent and abusive behaviors towards Ms. Jones, including throwing objects, destroying property, punching walls, and breaking furniture, as well as locking her out in the middle of the night. Many of these behaviors occurred while Ms. Jones was pregnant.\"\n\nThe league previously commenced a review based on the allegations from Instagram. The league undoubtedly will expand the investigation to include the claims made in the new lawsuit.\n\nRice served a six-game suspension to start the 2025 season, following a guilty plea to a March 2024 street-racing incident. His history could result in enhanced penalties, if the league finds he violated the Personal Conduct Policy again.\n\nThe situation also potentially impacts Rice's probation resulting from the street-racing incident. The agreement was announced in July; if any potential abuse occurred after the five-year period of probation commenced, he could face an argument that he violated the terms of his probation.",

    "description": "Three Detroit Lions landed in early 2026 NFL free agency rankings. Here’s what it means for Detroit.",
    "fullText": "As the Detroit Lions continue to balance a win-now roster with long-term cap flexibility, it’s no surprise to see several key contributors showing up in early 2026 NFL free agency rankings.\n\nAccording to Daniel Popper of The Athletic, three Lions defenders landed inside his positional rankings ahead of the 2026 offseason, a reminder that Detroit’s depth and development on defense hasn’t gone unnoticed around the league.\n\nHere’s a closer look at the Lions players who made the list and what it could mean for Brad Holmes’ offseason decisions.\n\nVeteran linebacker Alex Anzalone checks in at No. 49 overall in Popper’s rankings, with a projected contract of two years, $21 million.\n\nAnzalone has quietly been one of the most reliable pieces of Detroit’s defense over the past five seasons. He’s averaged nearly 100 tackles per year with the Lions and continues to thrive as a rangy, athletic off-ball linebacker.\n\nPopper highlights Anzalone’s speed, coverage versatility, and pass-rush value, noting that his 29.0% pressure rate ranked second among all off-ball linebackers. While he may not be the most physical run defender, his ability to blitz, cover, and diagnose plays keeps him highly valuable — especially in modern defenses.\n\nComing in at No. 79, edge rusher Al-Quadin Muhammad is projected by Popper to command a two-year, $18 million deal.\n\nMuhammad put together a breakout 2025 season, finishing with 11 sacks, the most among Detroit’s impending free agents. While he doesn’t have elite size or athletic traits for an edge defender, his efficiency stands out.\n\nPopper points to Muhammad’s ability to win late in reps, strong hand usage, and consistent pressure, noting that he ranked 14th in pressure rate among players with at least 250 pass-rush snaps.\n\nThat production makes him an ideal situational pass rusher — the kind of player teams covet for third-down packages.\n\nDefensive tackle Roy Lopez lands at No. 107 in the rankings, with a projected two-year, $12 million contract.\n\nLopez isn’t flashy, but his value lies in doing the dirty work. Popper describes him as a stout, technically sound nose tackle who can hold ground against double teams while still offering some interior push on passing downs.\n\nFor a Lions defense that has emphasized toughness and gap integrity up front, Lopez’s ability to stack blockers and control the interior has been quietly important.\n\nSeeing three Lions defenders ranked by Daniel Popper reinforces just how many tough decisions Detroit may face in the 2026 offseason. Retaining all three won’t be easy, especially with cap constraints looming, but each player fills a specific role that aligns with Dan Campbell’s defensive identity.\n\nWhether Brad Holmes chooses to re-sign, replace, or reshuffle these spots, one thing is clear: the rest of the league is paying attention to Detroit’s talent pipeline — and it’s going to cost real money to keep it intact.\n\nThe post 3 Detroit Lions Included in 2026 NFL Free Agency Rankings appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "fullText": "Birmingham City have confirmed the sale of their women’s team to Shelby Companies Limited (SCL).\n\nThe Championship club, owned by Americans Tom Wagner and NFL legend Tom Brady, announced that SCL combined with several independent investors to complete the purchase.\n\nSCL have acquired a 97% stake in the team, while the remaining three per cent was purchased by a group of independent investors.\n\nThis group includes popular businesswomen and world-renowned sporting icons.\n\nOne of the biggest names on the board is Birmingham and England Lionesses legend Karen Carney.\n\nCarney is one of the most respected figures in club football. She represented England 144 times during an outstanding international career.\n\nSince retiring from football, she has become a familiar and trusted voice on television, working as a pundit and commentator for broadcasters including ITV and TNT Sports.\n\nAnother high-profile investor in the Championship club is former World Tennis Association (WTA) number one Kim Clijsters.\n\nClijsters won multiple Grand Slam titles during a remarkable tennis career.\n\nOne of her most memorable achievements came at the US Open. She won the tournament as an unseeded player after stepping away from tennis to become a mother.\n\nClijsters was also appointed Honorary President of the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2022.\n\nBirmingham believe that the acquisition will “elevate the focus on the women’s team and help it to deliver on the stated ambition for the Club to compete at the highest levels in the women’s game”.\n\nThe new ownership group has decided against making immediate changes, so the current leadership team will continue running the day-to-day operations at the club.\n\nThe Birmingham City Women’s Football Club Board said: “The ambition is to go beyond anything that Birmingham City Women has achieved before – domestically and internationally.\n\n“And in the process, inspire a new generation of young girls, who will get the opportunity to perform in the planned women’s stadium within the Birmingham Sports Quarter.\n\n“This transaction will be a catalyst to make it happen.”",

    "description": "Here are some potential targets if the Eagles move off Jahan Dotson and explore free agency to find a replacement.",
    "fullText": "The life of a slot receiver on a Nick Sirianni-led Philadelphia Eagles team can be pretty uneventful. Sure, you're on the field, but for the most part, you're seen as expendable. Shortly after entering the NovaCare Complex, you were told that A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith, and Dallas Goedert will get the lion's share of targets.\n\nJahan Dotson's fate seemed sealed once we learned that Philadelphia was declining the fifth-year option on his rookie deal. There's been no extension announced, so we're going to assume we've seen his last game in an Eagles jersey. Here are a few options if free agency is explored to find a replacement.\n\nMaybe he's too rich for the Eagles' blood. Maybe he's less expensive than exercising Dotson's fifth-year option would have been. Who knows? One thing is certain. Alec Pierce is more than likely on the lists of every NFL team that will shop for a new wide receiver on the open market.\n\nDeebo Samuel doesn't have much left. Jauan Jennings seems to be too rich for Philadelphia's blood (and that's if he gets out of San Francisco). Rashid Shaheed is, seemingly, however, everything that Quez Watkins was supposed to become.\n\nHe has the hands that Watkins never had. Hmmm... Did Shaheed even drop a pass this season? Oh, and by the way, he's a nice option to return kicks, something the Eagles struggled with last season.\n\nIf Romeo Doubs were to land in Philadelphia, he might change Coach Sirianni's mind about ignoring the third receiver. This young man is too good to ignore.\n\nHe consistently wins contested catches, but sometimes that's a sign of something else. 'Contested catches' can sometimes mean guys are struggling to get open.\n\nEverything we've seen from Wan'Dale Robinson has come from seeing him play on an NFC East rival's roster. Often, he has had to do that without decent quarterback play. The G-Men added Jaxson Dart, and that helped. He had the best season of his career with Malik Nabers out.\n\nRobinson notched 92 receptions, 1,014 yards, and four TDs. He averages 9.2 yards per reception for his career, so he hasn't traveled very far down the field for the most part, but in this offense, the underneath stuff might be all that he needs to do.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: NFL Free Agency: 4 targets Eagles could sign to replace Jahan Dotson",

    "description": "On Friday, the NFL Players Association fired long-time security officer Craig Jones, whose eloquent email challenging the state of union leadership emerged last year, during the quickly-unfolding turmoil that resulted in the abrupt resignation of NFLPA executive director Lloyd Howell.",
    "fullText": "On Friday, the NFL Players Association fired long-time security officer Craig Jones, whose eloquent email challenging the state of union leadership emerged last year, during the quickly-unfolding turmoil that resulted in the abrupt resignation of NFLPA executive director Lloyd Howell.\n\nAfter being fired, Jones sent a new email to various current and former NFLPA employees. PFT has obtained a copy of the email, and has verified its authenticity.\n\nBecause Jones speaks directly to players in his email, and because plenty of players visit this space from time to time, we've decided to post the message in full.\n\nBefore posting, we invited the NFLPA to respond to all or any portion of it. The union declined to comment.\n\nHere's the full content of the Craig Jones email:\n\n\"Good day. My name is Craig Hampton Jones, and for 17 1/2 years, I was in the employ of the NFLPA. I served the union and the players we served with professional carriage, dedication, and with an enthusiasm for excellence. Through the years, I earned the respect of my peers and the players we served.\n\n\"On Jan. 18, 2026, I was informed that I was being placed on administrative leave for sending emails. On Feb. 13 2026 while in the throes of a family member being murdered on Jan. 25, while caring for my 94 year old mother who suffers with dementia, I received an email from Kim Murray that I was terminated immediately for sending emails deemed antagonistic.\n\n\"In the aftermath of Lloyd Howell's debacle and resignation, I sent an all staff email asking how we as a union move forward, cleansed of the miasma of Lloyd Howell's strip club schemes to undermine the NFLPA if chief architects of those schemes were still employed at the NFLPA.\n\n\"Another email that was deemed antagonistic was asking Jalen Maybin how you chose a new Executive Director with the same obvious flawed format that chose Lloyd Howell. My query was deemed antagonistic. But on Feb. 3, 2026, at the NFLPA press conference, 42 minutes in, Mike Jones of [The Athletic] asked Mr. Maybin, the exact same question I asked Mr. Maybin. At the same press conference, 54 minutes in Johnathan Jones of CBS Sports asked Mr. Maybin as well about the integrity of a selection process that is done 'oscuro.' My termination is nothing more than retaliation because I spoke simple truths to corrupt jaundice power. I couldn't stand silently by and watch the undermining of a storied union dedicated to the players whose trust we had earned with employees of commitment and a consistent well spring of results for our players.\n\n\"Charlatans bought in by Lloyd Howell in his attempt to pimp like Anamika Gupta and Matt Curtin, still lurk the halls of the NFLPA. And to make matters worse, the eunuch-esque leadership of David White and Jaylen Maybin and the jaded leadership of the HR department, morale is low in absence of prodigious leadership akin to Gene Upshaw and DeMaurice Smith.\n\n\"But players of today and storied players of yesteryear . . . don't despair or lose faith in the NFLPA.\n\n\"Even though the loyal workforce was eviserated [sic] unjustly by the Lloyd Howell banana republic and his leftover operatives still attempt to contaminate, please know players that there is still a small collective of honest, hardworking ethical staff who on most nights take their work on your behalf home with them because their regard for the players they behold as sacred.\n\n\"And despite the stench that still permeates in the ranks of some executive leadership, the rank and file of the employees who champion player concerns have faith that one day soon, players will again step up to preserve their gains and perform an exorcism within NFLPA executive leadership. The players once again becoming truly their brothers keeper will restore the union back to its illustrious mission. Always know players... with men of courage and altruism at the helm of leadership, the employees will ensure that you will never walk alone.\n\n\"To my former co-workers whom I hold so dear...you know who you are. I genuflect in your honor on how you continue unselfishly you to serve players with unwavering verve and professional aplomb as executive ineptitude swirls still around you. Don't despair. Muhammad Ali once told me, 'the deeper the pressure, the greater the poise.' You will always be cherished.\n\n\"I love you. Please remember what I always told you that I will always protect you so you can get home to your loved one's first, then I can go home to my love ones. Don't worry about me. No go fund me. I will for free any day protect what is right for free. As a prostate cancer survivor, I have no fear of the folly of fragile egotistical men. Tim Christine. I will always be indebted to the quasar light of your leadership. Finally to Don Davis and Zamir Cobb. I wish you well. You could have stood up for me.\n\nThe email strongly suggests that Jones will be exploring his options for a possible legal challenge to the termination. The union currently is defending a lawsuit filed by former in-house counsel Heather McPhee.\n\nAgain, the NFLPA has declined to comment on the termination of Jones, or as to the contents of his email.",

    "description": "The NFL's franchise tag window opened on Tuesday. Will the Broncos use one this offseason?",
    "fullText": "Beginning today, NFL teams are allowed to place one-year franchise (or transition) tags on one player ahead of the 2026 season. The deadline to place a one-year tag is March 3.\n\nIf a player is tagged, they have until July 15 to reach a long-term extension. If no extension is reached before that date, the player will spend the 2026 season on a one-year tag deal.\n\nDue to the high salaries associated with the tags, the Denver Broncos seem very unlikely to use one this offseason. The team's most notable pending free agent on offense is running back J.K. Dobbins, but the cost to franchise tag a running back is $14,536,000.\n\nThe club's most notable defensive player is defensive lineman John Franklin-Myers. Depending on whether he's categorized as a defensive end or defensive tackle, JFM's tag would be either $27,322,000 or $26,311,000. Either figure would likely be far out of Denver's offseason budget.\n\nDobbins might be a candidate to re-sign on a team-friendly, one-year deal, but it looks like JFM will be allowed to test the open market next month. The Broncos are not expected to tag either player before the March 3 deadline.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL free agency: Will Broncos use franchise tag in 2026?",

Buchheit gave 11 examples of teams being overly criticized by the report card, with the Cardinals being one of the teams.\n\nArizona Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill and general manager Monti Ossenfort speak to the press from the Arizona Cardinals training center in Tempe after the decision to fire head coach Jonathan Gannon on Jan. 5, 2026. Syndication: Arizona Republic\n\n“Arizona Cardinals: The Union ranked the Club last overall based on Player feedback, criticizing the treatment of families (lack of family events, limits on pregame sideline access, poor in-game family accommodations), and a so-called deficient locker room, training facilities, and weight room. The Union stated that Players also faulted owner Michael Bidwill, saying he ‘slightly contributes to a positive team culture’ and is only ‘somewhat committed to building a competitive team[.]’\n\nDec 28, 2024; Inglewood, California, USA; Arizona Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill reacts during the game against the Los Angeles Rams at SoFi Stadium.

Arizona, Buffalo Bills, Cincinnati Bengals, New York Jets and other teams were all mentioned in the grievance and will benefit from the bad PR that the report card handed down on each team’s owner.\n\nArizona did hire a new head coach in Mike LaFleur and owner Michael Bidwill claimed to be committed to winning. Despite not facing pressure from these report cards in the future, improving facilities and building a competitive team could be the start in the right direction.\n\nCardinals’ Kyler Murray mock trade shows low value in possible deal",

    "fullText": "Three-year NFL veteran and safety for the Cleveland Browns, Ronnie Hickman, was assaulted by a group of four individuals following a confrontation in the lobby of a Sixty Les hotel located on Allen Street in Manhattan, New York. The incident occurred at approximately 4:30 am after a group of individuals, who remain unidentified, approached Hickman shortly after he entered the building.\n\nAccording to the local authorities who originally spoke with the New York Post, police are actively investigating the matter, as well as whether or not Hickman’s status as a professional athlete had any influence in their decision to approach him. “The suspects slugged Hickman and took off,” the official report states.\n\nThe franchise itself confirmed that Hickman “was a victim of assault early Monday morning at a New York City hotel,” and a personal representative of the Ohio State product also informed the post that “Ronnie was treated for minor injuries at an area hospital after the incident, was later released, and is home resting with his family.”\n\nThe incident, unfortunately, comes right after Hickman had managed to enjoy a career-defining breakout. After recording just 70 total tackles with the Browns throughout all of 2023 and 2024, he managed to finally become a full-time starter in 2025.\n\nThe 2023 undrafted free agent tallied 103 combined tackles throughout his 17 starts this past season, snagging two interceptions and deflecting seven passes along the way. At this time, police have admitted that no arrests have been made and that all four of the primary suspects remain at large.\n\nStaff members who were on site at the time of the assault have also refused to offer up any sort of comments on the issue, but given the upscale nature of the establishment, it’s widely speculated that Hickman may have been profiled. The 24-year-old prospect is set to become a restricted free agent later this offseason, and will likely be resigning with the Browns for a “projected contract between $7 million to $8 million.”\n\nABC7 has suggested that Hickman was, in fact, identified by the four individuals, and that things only escalated after Hickman refused to acknowledge them, but that has yet to be confirmed by either official sources or any of the members in Hickman’s camp.\n\nThe post Cleveland Browns News: Ronnie Hickman Attacked by Goons in Sixty Les Hotel’s Lobby, No Arrests Yet appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "Who do you want the Eagles to draft?",
    "fullText": "Some of us may have the day off, but mock drafts never do.\n\nAfter a brief pause in 2024, Howie Roseman got back to trading first-round picks last year. He sticks to that habit by sending a late third- and fourth-round pick to the Vikings so he can snag another big-play machine for an Eagles offense that disappointed in 2025. Tyson dealt with multiple injuries at the college level but could prove to be a steal here, thanks to his ability to win downfield.\n\nIn this mock the Eagles trade up to 18 with the Vikings. If something like this were to happen, this would be another “how are teams letting the Eagles do this” move. Tyson has a lot of love in the draft community. I don’t quite get the hype, but that’s just me.\n\nHe may not have as much love in the NFL community though, as his injury history is a big concern. He missed time in 2022 and 2023 from a torn ACL, MCL, and PCL. He missed time in 2024 with a broken collarbone. He missed time in 2025 with injuries to both hamstrings.\n\nThe Eagles have work to do along the offensive line this offseason, especially with the injury issues that 35-year-old right tackle Lane Johnson had in 2025. Iheanachor had a great week at the Senior Bowl that fortified his status as one of the highest-upside players in this class. He has terrific size at 6-foot-6 and 330 pounds, plus his nifty footwork allows him to hold up in pass protection.\n\nIheanachor will need time to develop, as he did not play high school football and must refine his technique. (He took nine penalties in 2025, too.) Philly would be an ideal landing spot since he can sit and learn behind a future Hall of Famer for at least a year.\n\nIheanachor is a risk, but that has never stopped the Eagles.\n\nIheanachor moved to America from Nigeria when he was 13 and as Yates says, he didn’t play football in high school, starting his career at East Los Angeles College, a JUCO, transferring after two seasons. He started all 14 Sun Devil games this year, and 5 last year. A team that can have him continuing to bake as a backup makes sense, he’s got a lot of room to grow. He moves pretty stiff, and he looks like he’s still figuring things out. I’d also like to see my big OT play with some nastinesses, which I didn’t see from him.\n\nThe need to develop is to be expected, he wasn’t playing football five years ago. But new OL coach Chris Kuper has no track record of development, and Lane Johnson has missed time in every season since 2015, so his primary backup is going to see the field.\n\nIf AJ Brown moves on this offseason, the Philadelphia Eagles could turn to Washington’s Denzel Boston to fill the X-receiver role. Boston blends size, skill, and scoring ability into a package tailor-made for the NFL, offering a proven knack for turning targets into explosive plays.\n\nBoston’s fluidity, tempo management, and zone IQ also give him polished route-running skills, making him a true X-receiver prospect with immediate impact potential. For the Eagles, he offers the kind of contested-catch ability and downfield production that can change the dynamic of the passing game from day one.\n\nWe can go ahead and skip the “if.” One reason is that this is a good draft for big WRs, replacing AJ Brown, at least in theory, will be an option in the draft. Along with Boston, Ohio State’s Carnell Tate–who won’t be on the board when the Eagles currently pick, Jordyn Tyson, Louisville’s Chris Bell, and Notre Dame’s Malachi Fields are options too.\n\nBoston does a really good job of using his size as a weapon, but he’s not just a contested catch merchant, his separation is good too. He might not run the fastest 40 but he can go get the ball down the field. I’m a fan.",

    "fullText": "Every offseason brings speculation, projection models, and plenty of debate — but nothing captures long-range anticipation quite like the way-too-early MVP odds. Before a single snap of the season is played, sportsbooks and analysts are already trying to forecast which superstar will dominate the narrative across the NFL landscape in 2026. These early numbers don’t just reflect talent — they reflect team trajectory, offensive stability, durability, and the ever-important storylines that shape voter perception.\n\nAt the front of the conversation are familiar faces who’ve already proven they can carry franchises and command national attention. Josh Allen remains a perennial contender because of his rare blend of physicality and high-volume production. Lamar Jackson continues to redefine quarterback play with explosive dual-threat impact that can reshape games week to week. Meanwhile, Patrick Mahomes is almost permanently positioned in MVP discussions simply because excellence has become routine.\n\nJust behind them sit elite passers still chasing that defining MVP season. Justin Herbert possesses statistical upside that could translate into award recognition if team success follows. And Joe Burrow continues to build a résumé centered on precision, composure, and winning in high-leverage moments.\n\nOf course, “way too early” is the operative phrase. Injuries, breakout stars, coaching changes, and unexpected team surges will inevitably reshape the race. But right now, these odds offer a snapshot of who the football world expects to define the 2026 season — and whose performance could ultimately shape the league’s competitive hierarchy.\n\nOdds: +550\nAllen’s MVP case always starts with his physical dominance — few quarterbacks can stress defenses as both a power runner and vertical passer the way he does. If his efficiency stabilizes late in the season and turnover swings tighten up, he becomes incredibly hard to beat in voting. A top seed paired with highlight-reel production would make him the clear betting favorite.\n\nOdds: +650\nJackson’s ceiling is still unmatched when his rushing explosiveness and passing rhythm peak at the same time. Voters tend to reward his dual-threat dominance when his offense is built around his improvisational strengths. Another season where he controls tempo and stays healthy deep into January would put him squarely in the MVP spotlight again.\n\nOdds: +1000\nMahomes is almost permanently in the MVP conversation because of how consistently he elevates his offense regardless of surrounding personnel. If his statistical output rebounds into league-leading territory while maintaining elite situational play, the narrative momentum quickly returns. He’s the classic “never count him out” candidate when big moments pile up.\n\nOdds: +1000\nHerbert’s MVP path hinges on translating elite arm talent into sustained team success over a full season. When his deep passing and high-volume production align with efficient red-zone execution, his numbers look historic. A breakout year in the win column could finally convert his statistical brilliance into major award recognition.\n\nOdds: +1000\nBurrow’s candidacy thrives on precision, timing, and leadership in high-leverage moments. When his offense operates at peak efficiency and he controls games late, voters tend to gravitate toward his poised style. If he combines elite passing totals with another deep playoff push narrative, his MVP momentum can surge quickly.\n\nEarly MVP odds are less prediction and more temperature check — a reflection of reputation, momentum, and projected opportunity. They highlight who the league believes will matter most before the season even begins. And while the eventual winner often emerges from unexpected circumstances, these early favorites set the stage for the narratives, rivalries, and performances that will define the 2026 MVP race.\n\nOLYMPICS: 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings entering February 15\n\nDAYTONA 500: 2026 Daytona 500 starting lineup & TV schedule\n\nNFL: Tennessee Titans’ new logo leaked in Fanatics mishap?\n\nNBA: Mac McClung shares 2026 NBA Slam Dunk arsenal fans were robbed of\n\nGOLF: 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am tee times, Round 4 groupings for Sunday\n\nVIRAL: 2026 Winter Olympics star compares muscles with NFL running back Saquon Barkley\n\nThe post Way too early NFL MVP odds for 2026 appeared first on The Big Lead.",

The Kelce brothers showcased their creativity for Valentine’s Day by making cheeky, punny cards. The Chiefs’ tight end made sweet references to Jumanji, his NFL career, and even Swift’s sourdough obsession. However, fans were impressed by Kelce’s witty reference to Swift’s song “Wood” in one of the creatives shared via an Instagram carousel.\n\nTravis Kelce referenced Taylor Swift’s song “Wood” in a Valentine’s Day card. The New Heights podcast’s official Instagram account shared a carousel showcasing their wholesome Valentine’s Day greetings. The first slide in the carousel read, “Wood you be my Valentine?” accompanied by an animated tree and Kelce smiling.\n\nFor those who missed it, this is a reference to Swift’s raunchy track “Wood” from her 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl. Notably, the global pop star has dedicated the song to her fiancé. The lyrics make a cheeky reference to Kelce’s podcast, New Heights, and his manhood as well. Swift sings, “New Heights (New Heights) of manhood (Manhood) / I ain’t gotta knock on wood” (via Page Six).\n\nFans are loving Kelce’s sweet tribute to Swift and lavished praise in the comments section. One fan commented, “Y’all had the opportunity to do the funniest thing and you did! Good job!!!” A second fan wrote, “These are too good,” accompanied by a laughing emoji. A third fan penned, “WOOD YOU BE MY VALENTINE HAHAHAHAHAH 13/13,” accompanied by clapping emojis. Finally, one fan remarked, “The wood one is my fav.”\n\nFans joked that Kelce is redeeming himself after previously not understanding a witty reference to Swift’s song “Wood.” During the Wednesday, January 21, episode of New Heights, Kelce joked that “Taylor’s gonna kill me” for missing a clear reference to Swift’s song “Wood.”\n\nThe post Travis Kelce’s Valentine’s Day Card Comes With Taylor Swift Twist appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "description": "NFL general managers will have to be creative in coming up with trades this offseason.",
    "fullText": "Player trades in the NFL have become more common in recent years, and one NFL insider believes the trend will continue this offseason.\n\nOn a recent episode of “The Adam Schefter Podcast,” the ESPN NFL reporter said it may be tougher for teams to get impact players this season through traditional means, meaning teams will likely be involved in more trades.\n\n“When we talk about the draft, and we’ll see how it shakes out over time, people aren’t all that excited about the draft,” Schefter said. “We got a free-agent class that’s not really deep. We’ve got a draft that is not considered really deep. You know what that tells me? More trades. That’s what it tells me. It tells me we may get more wheeling and dealing in trades than we’ve had in other years.”\n\nSchefter added that although he has not heard any specific trades that are brewing, he sees the activity around the Nov. 4 trade deadline as an indication of teams willing to make more deals to fix their rosters.\n\nThe trade market could be utilized by teams to acquire quarterbacks. This year’s quarterback draft class is not projected to be as strong as recent years, with Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza expected to go as the first overall pick and Alabama’s Ty Simpson appearing to be the only other quarterback projected as a first-round selection.\n\nKyler Murray (Arizona Cardinals) and Mac Jones (San Francisco 49ers) are expected to be the top targets on the trade market, with Raiders quarterback Geno Smith also expected to garner interest.\n\nOn the defensive side, Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby could be another player moved, although it has been previously reported that a deal for him could come after he finishes recovering from a knee injury he suffered late last season.",

    "title": "2026 NFL mock draft tracker: 40 mocks, 21 prospects for Dallas Cowboys",
    "description": "There are so many mock drafts.",
    "fullText": "At the end of January, we published our first mock draft database of the season. At the time, 21 of the 25 mocks (84%) were projecting the Cowboys to take a linebacker, with Sonny Styles (17 mocks, 68%) the clear favorite. The second most popular position was cornerback with 15 picks (60%), followed by edge rushers with 11 picks (44%). The early consensus seemed to be LB Sonny Styles with the 12th pick and a CB with the 20th pick, a combo offered by 10 of the 25 mocks or 40% of the time.\n\nBut a lot has happened since then: The Super Bowl came and went, this year’s salary cap was announced, the Senior Bowl is behind us, and the Cowboys look to have completed their coaching hires, so it’s again time to turn our attention to the very serious business of mock drafting.\n\nOn the hypothesis that the predictive value of multiple mock drafts is greater than that of a single mock, we are taking a survey of 40 different mock drafts today. Importantly, all 40 mocks were published on or after February 1st, giving us a big data set of the latest mock drafts. And here are all those 40 mocks, and which two players they have the Cowboys selecting.\n\nbody .sbnu-legacy-content-table td, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table th, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table { border: 1px solid #000 !important; border-collapse: collapse !important; }\n\nThat’s a ton of info to digest, with 21 different prospects mocked to the Cowboys somewhere in the first round, so let’s look at a few more digestible extracts from this exercise, starting with how this round of mocks compares to the last one.\n\nbody .sbnu-legacy-content-table td, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table th, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table { border: 1px solid #000 !important; border-collapse: collapse !important; }\n\nMock Draft distribution by Player Posiition\n\nWhat we see here is a shift away from linebackers to edge rushers, plus a strong increase in “other positions” that didn’t get much attention in January. Naturally, this produces some “winners and losers” among the players mocked to Dallas:\n\nbody .sbnu-legacy-content-table td, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table th, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table { border: 1px solid #000 !important; border-collapse: collapse !important; }\n\nMock Draft distribution by Player Posiition\n\nSonny Styles still remains the consensus favorite for the Cowboys, but his lead over other prospects has dropped. At cornerback, the attention in the mock drafts shifted towards the top two guys in this draft class, Mansoor Delane and Jermod McCoy at the expense of the other corners in this class. At edge, the Cowboys are completely out of the Rueben Bain and David Bailey sweepstakes, but Cashius Howell and T.J. Parker are new names popping up in the mocks. Safety is getting some mock interest, but having Caleb Downs dropping all the way to No. 12 seems more like a pipe dream than anything else at the moment. But keep an eye on Emmanuel McNeill-Warren, he’s been getting increasing interest lately. Also, why anybody would have the Cowboys invest their No. 12 pick in a WR, RB, or DT is completely beyond me.\n\nBut all of that doesn’t yet tell us too much about how the first round could play out for the Cowboys. For that, I plotted where seven specific players were taken in each of the 50 mocks. Those seven players are:\n\nThe top safety, and maybe the best player in the draft, Caleb Downs\n\nThe consensus top pick from the 40 mocks, Sonny Styles\n\nThe top six edge rushers in the 40 mocks\n\nThe top four corners mocked to the Cowboys\n\nHere’s how often each player was taken at which spot in the 50 mocks:\n\nbody .sbnu-legacy-content-table td, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table th, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table { border: 1px solid #000 !important; border-collapse: collapse !important; }\n\n40 Mock Drafts – Summary Results\n\nThis table illustrates how the first round could likely play out for the Cowboys and the prospects they are interested in. One of the top two pass rushers, Bain or Bailey, is headed to Tennessee (#4) with the other one likely going to Washington (#7). Caleb Downs is a top 10 pick, and has a hard stop at Cincinnati (#10), though there is a slim chance he could fall to the Cowboys.\n\nLB Sonny Styles could be a consideration for Washington at #7, but they should happily bite on one of the falling pass rushers, so there’s a 70% (28 of 40 mocks) chance he’ll be available at #12 for the Cowboys. Barring Caleb Downs falling to them (12.5% chance), the Cowboys should have the option of picking between Styles (70%) or cornerbacks Mansoor Delane (37.5%) or Jermod McCoy (50%). Which of the two corners fall depends on what Miami does at #11.\n\nThe mocks seem to agree, for now, that pass rusher is the likely pick at #20 for the Cowboys, and depending on which player the Cowboys have their eyes on, they might even consider trading down from the 20th spot if they can find a team interested in moving up.\n\nOverall, that leaves the Cowboys with a lot of options, and if you boil it down to position combinations, here are the most frequent combinations among the 40 mocks:\n\nTo get a little more clarity on which player could be available for the Cowboys, you can look up the player ranking on your favorite big board, you can make up your own ranking, and you could even use a consensus big board to figure out such a ranking.\n\nOr we could look at the average draft position for each player based on the 40 mocks above, which is exactly what you’ll see in the table below. I included all LBs, CBs, edge rushers and safeties that were mocked to the Cowboys at least once, and added four more players to round things out (LB Arvell Reese, DE Rueben Bain, DE David Bailey, CB Avieon Terrell). To arrive at the average rank, I calculated the average across the 40 mocks, and where a player fell out of the Top 32, I used the 33th spot to calculate the average draft position.\n\nbody .sbnu-legacy-content-table td, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table th, body .sbnu-legacy-content-table { border: 1px solid #000 !important; border-collapse: collapse !important; }\n\nWithin the confines of this 40-mock data set, that gives the Cowboys plenty of options, with the big caveat that it’s still a long way to go to the draft.\n\nWhat would be your choice right now, based on these 40 mocks and the 21 prospects mocked to the Cowboys?",

However, then Illinois defensive backs coach Aaron Henry immediately saw something in him that others missed. “I really believe the Good Lord just creates people who are a little bit different, I saw that the first day I got to campus. There was no denying that. He played so hard. He was not ducking contact,” he told FoxSports.\n\nHenry knew Witherspoon wasn’t ready for Big Ten physicality and focused on reshaping Devon’s body and refine his game. Devon never said no to any challenges put forth to him.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks ended up drafting Devon with the 5th overall pick in the NFL Draft. Three Pro Bowls later,  he has been arguably the heartbeat of the turnaround of the franchise who are now Super Bowl Champions.\n\nAs the new defensive back’s coach settles into South Bend, Aaron Henry will be able to walk into the locker room with immediate credibility.

    "fullText": "The Indianapolis Colts had three different quarterbacks start games this past season. So, where did each of them land in NFL.com's starting quarterback rankings?\n\nNick Shook recently ranked all 63 quarterbacks who made a start last season. Based on their play in the regular season and playoffs, he then listed those quarterbacks from 1 to 63, placing them in tiers.\n\nMaking a big jump and landing in Tier 2 was Daniel Jones. For more on Jones' ranking and why Shook placed him there, you can find that here.\n\nBut what about Phillip Rivers and Riley Leonard?\n\nRivers came in at No. 36 and in Tier 5. A few others in this category included Kyler Murray, Joe Flacco, Spencer Rattler, and others.\n\n\"The 44-year-old proved he could still succeed with his brain; his arm, however, showed his age,\" Shook wrote.\n\nIn his three games, Rivers completed 63% of his passes for 544 yards with four touchdowns and three interceptions.\n\nThe Colts, unfortunately, did not win any of those games, but Rivers routinely put the offense into favorable looks pre-snap and helped that unit sustain drives and hang around in games, giving Indianapolis a chance.\n\nThe Colts needed stability at quarterback, and Rivers was able to provide that.\n\nLeonard, meanwhile, came in at No. 47 in these rankings and in Tier 6. Carson Wentz, Shedeur Sanders, Russell Wilson, and others were in this tier.\n\n\"Riley Leonard made one start and was shockingly effective, slinging the ball around the yard as if there was no tomorrow in a high-scoring loss to Houston,\" Shook wrote.\n\nAs Shook said, Leonard's start against Houston -- a very good defense -- in Week 18 was quite good. He completed 21-of-34 passes for 270 yards with two touchdowns and one interception.\n\nIt wasn't perfect by any means, but Leonard always found a way to respond. Could he be the Colts' backup quarterback in 2026?\n\nAnthony Richardson would appear in a couple of games before being placed on IR, but did not make any starts. So he did not qualify for Shook's rankings.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: Every starting QB from 2025 ranked: Where do Colts QBs land?",

    "description": "Six quarterback prospects that the Packers could target in the 2026 NFL Draft.",
    "fullText": "In the last three drafts, Brian Gutekunst has selected two quarterbacks on Day 3. The Green Bay Packers general manager drafted Sean Clifford in the fifth round of the 2023 NFL Draft and Michael Pratt in the seventh round of the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nWith Jordan Love's backup, Malik Willis set to hit the open market and fetch a big payday, the Packers could be in the market to invest another Day 3 pick as they look to find a new backup for Love.\n\nLet's dive into some Day 3 quarterbacks who could be targets for the Packers during the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThe winningest quarterback in college football history started his collegiate career at South Dakota State University, where he helped guide the Jackrabbits to two national championships. He has that \"it\" factor and he's not going to sink the ship. He'd keep Green Bay’s offense on track if he were forced into action. Much like Willis, the former SDSU quarterback can do damage with his legs. This past season at Iowa, he picked up 49 first downs with his legs. During his time in Brookings, he picked up 146 first downs on the ground and also had 60 runs of 10-plus yards.\n\nMark Gronowski is tough as nails. Tweaks his shoulder and still punches in the rushing touchdown to put Iowa up 24-16 at the half against Nebraska. pic.twitter.com/8f8Vn3tQJi\n\n— KCRG Sports (@KCRG_Sports) November 28, 2025\n\nPayton helped guide the Bison to a national championship during his first season as a starter. The southpaw quarterback threw for 2,719 yards and 16 touchdowns. Payton added 777 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns. A former baseball player, Payton has the arm strength to rip throws into tight windows. He's able to navigate the rush and make accurate throws on the move. He has good acceleration when he gets outside the pocket and runs with the determination of a running back.\n\nNDSU QB Cole Payton is one of those draft, stash, & “develop” QB prospects you take mid draft. \n\nCrazy throw right here lol. Multiple reasons to buy in and see what you can mold him into. pic.twitter.com/RYnL21qVyW\n\n— Damian Parson💰 (@DP_NFL) February 6, 2026\n\nMrton has a quick setup and gets the ball out quickly. He sees the field well and understands where his outlets are. He's athletic in the pocket and comfortable making throws outside the pocket. He's got good zip on short and intermediate throws and shows good accuracy. Over the past two seasons, Morton threw for 5,900 yards and 47 touchdowns.\n\nBehren Morton is a productive and multi-faceted QB with elastic arm action, placing among nations leaders in categories of both efficiency and explosiveness@BehrenMorton also sits among the top of @TexasTechFB record books for career passing yds + total offense #WreckEm https://t.co/JHBsJ9lQ8t pic.twitter.com/cGLixeoPrd\n\n— Shane Coughlin (@Shane__Coughlin) January 10, 2026\n\nThe transfer from Boise State, Green passed for 5,868 yards and 34 touchdowns during his two seasons at Arkansas. Standing at 6-6 and 229 pounds, Green looks good off the bus and he has a rocket for an arm. Now it will be up to an NFL coaching staff to harness that natural arm strength and help him spray the ball accurately all over the field. Green can do damage with his legs, rushing for 1,379 yards and 16 touchdowns during his two seasons with the Razorbacks.\n\nA Texas native, Robertson started his collegiate career at Mississippi State before transferring to Baylor. This past season, Robertson threw for 3,681 yards and 31 touchdowns. He's a natural gunslinger with easy-looking arm talent. He has a quick reaction to get the ball out and on time.\n\nUSD's all-time leader in passing yards and completions is going to impress teams when he gets in front of them. He's a leader and an impressive individual off the field. At 6-5, 225 pounds, the USD quarterback is well built. He finished this past season with 2,876 yards and 26 touchdowns. The Minnesota native and Iowa State transfer has ties to Green Bay. Bouman's father, Todd Bouman, a long-time backup NFL quarterback, spent a minute with the Packers in 2006 as the team's backup quarterback after Aaron Rodgers got injured.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers Wire: 6 QB targets for Packers on Day 3 of 2026 NFL Draft",

    "description": "Could the Cowboys look to trade UP in the 2026 NFL Draft?",
    "fullText": "With the 2026 NFL Draft quickly approaching, mock drafts and draft conversation are at their peak. For the Dallas Cowboys, who currently do not own a day two pick in the draft, many fans and analysts are looking at potential trade back scenarios from the 12th or 20th overall pick to pickup an additional second- or third-round pick on day two.\n\nBut Zach Wolchuk of 105.3 The Fan asked an interesting question on Twitter on Thursday that got the brain spinning. Could the Cowboys use their two first-round picks this year to move up in the draft, while also picking up a day two pick with their trade partner?\n\nIn Wolchuk’s scenario, he asked if people would be okay trading the 12th and 20th overall pick to the Cleveland Browns for the 6th and 39th overall pick? In most draft classes, the 20th overall pick is right on the border of landing a first-round talent. But in this draft class that is substantially weaker than most, first round grades will likely max out at around 14. So realistically, the player the Cowboys would be drafting at 20 will more than likely have a second-round grade. If that is the case, the Cowboys would be wise to explore trading up in this draft, using their two first-rounders as ammo to draft a blue-chip player in the top eight, while also adding at least one pick on day two.\n\nIn most draft classes, the 20th overall pick is right on the border of landing a first-round talent.

If that is the case, the Cowboys would be wise to explore trading up in this draft, using their two first-rounders as ammo to draft a blue-chip player in the top eight, while also adding at least one pick on day two.\n\nDallas trades the 12th and 20th (616 value points) overall picks in the 2026 NFL Draft to Cleveland for the 6th and 39th (599 value points) overall pick. Using StickToTheModel.com draft simulator, the Cowboys select safety Caleb Downs with the sixth overall pick and edge rusher R Mason Thomas with the 39th overall pick.\n\nDallas trades the 12th, 20th, and 215th overall pick (617 value points) to the New Orleans for the 8th, 42nd, 73rd, and 189th (618 value points) overall pick. Using Pro Football Focus’ draft simulator, the Cowboys select safety Caleb Downs with the eighth overall pick, cornerback Colton Hood with the 42nd overall pick, and linebacker Jacob Rodriguez with the 73rd overall pick.\n\nDallas offers the 12th, 20th, and 150th overall pick (629 value points) to Kansas City for the 9th and 74th overall pick and cornerback Trent McDuffie (619 value points). Using StickToTheModel.com draft simulator, the Cowboys select defensive end Rueben Bain Jr. with the ninth overall pick and safety Kamari Ramsey with the 74th overall pick.\n\nWith both the New York Giants and Washington Commanders picking inside the top 10 and unlikely to hand their divisional rival a blue chip talent, that leaves just a handful of spots that make sense for the Cowboys to consider. Given the value it would take to move into the top five, th Cowboys only have a few options to consider, but those couple options could give the Cowboys a chance at a player they would not be able to consider at 12, while also landing a quality player on day two and/or three.\n\nThere are only a few players likely to motivate the Cowboys to trade up in this draft. Ohio State safety Caleb Downs being one. Miami edge rusher Reuben Bain Jr. being one. But players like Texas Tech edge rusher David Bailey, LSU cornerback Mansoor Delane, and Ohio State linebacker Sonny Styles are also a few names to consider in this exercise.",
