    "fullText": "The Arizona Cardinals announced a practice squad addition and had a player from the practice squad depart. Cornerback Chigozie Anusiem, who had been on the practice squad since the start of the season, was signed by the Las Vegas Raiders to their active roster.\n\nThe Cardinals announced the signing of receiver Steven Sims, who had a tryout with the team on Monday.\n\nSims is 5-10 and 176 pounds. He has been in the NFL since 2019, playing for Washington, Pittsburgh, Houston and Baltimore. He has played in 53 games, starting six, and has 78 career receptions for 704 yards and five touchdowns. He also has averaged 25.2 yards on kick returns with a touchdown in his career.\n\nIt would not be a surprise to see him elevated this weekend to return kicks against the Houston Texans.\n\nWith Anusiem's departure, the Cardinals have 16 players on the practice squad. They have one vacancy. Here is the current makeup of the unit.\n\nDL Denzel Daxon (international exemption)\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

That would suggest it's a value.\n\nAnd if 44-year old Philip Rivers comes out with a mojo that only he can have, the Colts could win this game for sure.\n\nMORE: How the 6-7 meme sums up the Chiefs' season perfectly\n\nThe spread, in the ballpark of 13 or 14 points, is a tough one, too.\n\nYes, Seattle is playing great.

    "description": "Mendoza is a top prospect for the 2026 NFL draft, but if his football career doesn't pan out, he'd also probably be a top candidate for a job in finance.",
    "fullText": "On Saturday, 22-year-old Fernando Mendoza led the Indiana Hoosiers to their first Big Ten championship since 1967 — but the top quarterback's professional résumé looks nearly as impressive as his football record.\n\nWith their 13-10 win over Ohio State, Indiana secured the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff for the first time in program history — and Mendoza's performance solidified his Heisman Trophy frontrunner status.\n\nBorn and raised in Miami, Mendoza was a two-star recruit out of high school and overlooked by most Power 4 programs. He was committed to playing at Yale until Cal lost a prospect and called him up with an offer he couldn't turn down: a free education and better football.\n\nAfter three seasons at Cal, where he worked his way up to starting quarterback and graduated from the prestigious Haas School of Business, he transferred to Indiana last winter. The move meant losing his scholarship with Cal, but earning a lot more money in endorsement deals.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, one of the first things he did with his \"name, image, likeness\" earnings was to cover the cost of the two classes he needed to graduate from Cal after his scholarship was terminated.\n\nMendoza, who's now pursuing his master's at Indiana's Kelley School of Business, spends more time on LinkedIn than he does on Instagram, TikTok, or other social platforms.\n\n\"The only social media that's on my phone right now is LinkedIn and YouTube to watch videos,\" he told The Herald Times. He has an Instagram account with more than 80,000 followers, but enlists his younger brother, Alberto, who also plays quarterback for the Hoosiers, to manage it.\n\nA post shared by HeraldTimesOnline (@heraldtimesonline)\n\nMendoza is a top prospect for the 2026 NFL draft, but if his football career doesn't pan out, he'd also be a top candidate for a job in finance.\n\nHe's spent his last few summers interning at real estate investment firms ACRE and Newmark. Juggling his internships with hours of football practice required a 5:30 a.m. wake-up call and an intricate whiteboard, where he'd keep a running list of action items.\n\nMendoza is just as disciplined with his money as he is with his schedule.\n\n\"He doesn't spend any money on himself,\" his mom told the WSJ. \"All he does is invest.\"\n\nA post shared by Big Ten Network (@bigtennetwork)\n\nHis brother, with whom he shared a room growing up and now shares a car, pointed out that he also doesn't like to spend money on gas.\n\nAlberto told Big Ten Network: \"I go to use the car, and it's empty. There's no more gas in the car, and I'm like, 'We're just gonna use the car and not fill it back up?' And Fernando is like, 'Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad.' … And then I have to go to the gas station on like one mile of gas.\"",
