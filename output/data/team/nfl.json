Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nRunning backs have a short shelf life in the NFL, and for players who are bell cows, that is even more so, yet Baltimore Ravens running back Derrick Henry continues to buck that trend.\n\nNormally, we see production start to decline once players reach their late 20s, but in Henry's case, he's still the All-Pro we've known for years.\n\nIn 2025, despite the Ravens' struggles, Henry still posted 1,595 yards and 16 touchdowns at the ripe age of 31. That's ridiculous.\n\nAnd for Maurice Jones-Drew, in his top 64 starting running backs piece for NFL.com, Henry came in at No. 6.\n\n“Other than some early-season fumbling issues, Henry had one hell of a season at 31 years old,” Jones-Drew wrote. “The ageless wonder continued to trounce defenses and finished the season with an absolute bang, rushing for 570 yards and six touchdowns on 85 carries over the final four games.\n\n\"That's 6.7 per clip. Normally, the football world starts to wonder when 31-year-old running backs will consider hanging 'em up. Henry feels far from it.”\n\nMore:Ravens make $74.5 million contract stance clear with Lamar Jackson\n\nMost 31-year-old running backs just want to be productive for their teams.\n\nBut in Henry's case, he's dominating.\n\nIn his last seven NFL seasons, Henry has surpassed 1,500 rushing yards five times and has had 16 rushing TDs four times. Let that sink in.\n\nPlus, he's played every regular-season game in the last three years. That speaks to his longevity in the game.\n\nSome thought Henry was declining when he joined Baltimore in 2024 after a 1,167-yard, 12-TD season in 2023, but he's shown that, at least right now, Father Time is going to have to wait.\n\n2 huge roster decisions could define new Ravens HC\n\nSteve Bisciotti didn't want 'jerk move' to happen to Ravens ex John Harbaugh\n\nWhy Ravens owner was right to fire John Harbaugh\n\nRavens owner makes outstanding Lamar Jackson contract stance",

    "fullText": "Bruised and battle-hardened, Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills face Denver on Saturday as their star quarterback seeks to reach his first Super Bowl and add the NFL's biggest prize to his list of accolades.\n\nThe league's reigning Most Valuable Player suffered a head blow, a sprained knee and a hand injury in last weekend's hard-fought clash with Jacksonville, but almost single-handedly dragged his team over the line.\n\nNow, Allen has been cleared fit to play against the Broncos -- the AFC's top seed -- in their highly anticipated divisional round game, knowing victory would leave them just one win away from next month's NFL championship decider.\n\n\"I feel good. Honestly, I feel better than I have the last few weeks,\" Allen, who has also been managing a long-term foot injury, told a press conference.\n\nAllen's run of 122 consecutive starts is the longest streak among active quarterbacks and has led to his teammates and fans jokingly referring to him as \"Superman.\"\n\nBut the quarterback, who hails from the agricultural Central Valley of California, told reporters his toughness came from being a \"country boy\" from \"out in the middle of nowhere.\"\n\nHe also acknowledged that the defensive line he will be facing is notoriously robust.\n\n\"They've got some absolute studs over there. Obviously they rush the passer extremely well,\" said Allen.\n\n\"Interior, again, some big stout guys that can really push the pocket.\"\n\nFor Denver, the match-up comes after a bye week, and offers another chance to prove that one of this season's surprise packages can be the real deal at the business end of the campaign.\n\nDespite finishing top of the AFC with the league's joint best record (14-3), the Broncos figure only fifth on the betting market's predicted Super Bowl winners.\n\nStar cornerback Pat Surtain said the team would be relying on a raucous crowd to spur them on for the Broncos' first postseason home game since 2015.\n\n\"I know the atmosphere is going to be crazy, the stadium is going to be rocking,\" Surtain said.\n\n\"I can already feel the magnitude of it,\" he added.\n\nIt is also a chance for the Broncos to avenge last year's devastating 31-7 playoff loss in Buffalo.\n\nElsewhere on Saturday, the injury-ravaged San Francisco 49ers will attempt the next step in their bid to reach a home-field Super Bowl by taking on the high-flying Seattle Seahawks.\n\nThe clash pits the two divisional rivals against each other for the second time in three weeks.\n\nAs top seeds in the NFC, the Seahawks also had a bye last weekend. By contrast the 49ers -- who have been decimated by a deepening injury crisis for much of the season -- suffered yet another cruel blow against Philadelphia, when tight end George Kittle tore his Achilles tendon.\n\n\"We've kind of been in a hole for about seven months and once you get to the playoffs, it really doesn't matter,\" said 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan, of the non-stop schedule.\n\n\"Everyone's into it. So, whether they gave us three days, one day, eight days... whenever you get dealt your hand, you're ready to roll.\"\n\nThis year's Super Bowl will be held at the 49ers' home stadium, in Santa Clara, California, on February 8.\n\nIn Sunday's remaining divisional round games, the New England Patriots will host the Houston Texans, and the Los Angeles Rams travel to the Chicago Bears.",

    "fullText": "Against all odds, the San Francisco 49ers find themselves facing the Seattle Seahawks for a trip to the NFC Championship, and I expect Christian McCaffrey & Co. to stun the oddsmakers when they hit the field on Saturday night.\n\nA rematch of last year’s playoff showdown is in store, and while Denver has home-field advantage this time around, I’m not betting against Josh Allen.\n\nAs good as Denver’s pass rush is, Buffalo’s O-line remains elite, and Allen is coming off one of his best playoff starts to date.\n\nThe Bills’ defense has proven it will bend but not break, so I’ll take Buffalo to survive the Mile High City.\n\nKyle Shanahan and Robert Saleh continue to work their magic in San Francisco, most recently coaching their asses off in a thrilling win over Philadelphia.\n\nNo Fred Warner? No Nick Bosa? Brandon Aiyuk MIA? No problem for Bang Bang Niner Gang.\n\nThis is just Sam Darnold’s second career playoff start, and we all know how the first one went. The Seahawks being favored by a full touchdown screams impending letdown.\n\nI’m betting on the underdogs to pull off another miracle.\n\nConcussions to both Texans WR1 Nico Collins and Patriots CB1 Christian Gonzalez essentially cancel each other out, but the combination of New England’s cold-weather advantage and stingy defense will force another poor outing from C.J. Stroud.\n\nDeMeco Ryans’ team has been eliminated in the Divisional Round in consecutive seasons, and I see that trend continuing on Sunday.\n\nThe Rams are going to have to play much better than what they showed against Carolina, but Matthew Stafford and the L.A. offense are going to absolutely shred the Bears on Sunday.\n\nChicago couldn’t stop a nosebleed in the first half against Green Bay, and poor second-half coaching from Matt LaFleur — along with a godly throw on 4th-and-8 by Caleb Williams — is the only reason the Bears are still alive.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "fullText": "Fans of Seattle sports often feel their teams are constantly overlooked, or even outright ignored. They feel this way because it's quite literally true. It's an unfortunate blend of \"East Coast bias\" and \"I think people actually just forget the Pacific Northwest even exists.\" I wouldn't be shocked if a sizable portion of folks living east of the Mississippi still think we live like Lewis and Clark up here.\n\nThis is the case for the Seattle Seahawks. A team that won 14 games, has the best defense in football, has the best receiver in football, and earned the No. 1 seed in the playoffs. Yet for most of the country, people still had a \"wow, where did this team come from?\" mentality, only realizing the Seahawks were having a special season when they could no longer ignore them. Even still, this Seahawks squad is largely a mystery for those outside of the PNW, or NFC West.\n\nOne person who has not ignored Seattle all year long has been Good Morning Football co-host Kyle Brandt. On Thursday, Brandt took to the streets of New York City with one simple mission: find as many people as he could who could accurately identify an image of Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald.\n\nThe results were... exactly how you assume they went, and can be seen in the tweet below.\n\nThe Seahawks won 14 games and the 1 seed. \n\nCan NFL fans name Seattle’s head coach? pic.twitter.com/2UDqjVaqiW\n\n— Kyle Brandt (@KyleBrandt) January 15, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald not recognized... literally",

    "fullText": "The Indianapolis Colts finished the 2025 NFL season with one of the best offensive line units in the game, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\nPFF compiled its final rankings of the season, and coming in at No. 2 were the Colts. The Denver Broncos were the only team ahead of Indianapolis.\n\nAccording to PFF's data, Quenton Nelson was the fourth-ranked guard in football. Tanor Bortolini was one of the NFL's \"top breakout players\" by PFF's grading system.\n\n\"Indianapolis replaced center Ryan Kelly and guard Will Fries with Tanor Bortolini and Matt Goncalves, respectively, and both played at a very high level in 2025,\" wrote PFF's Zoltan Buday.\n\nWithout question, through the first half of the season, the Colts' offensive line unit was operating at a high level. However, with the eye test, I don't know that this was the second-best unit down the stretch.\n\nFrom Week 12 on, Jonathan Taylor didn't eclipse the 100-yard rushing mark. He had only one game during that span where he averaged at least 4.0 yards per carry.\n\nGM Chris Ballard even mentioned during his end-of-season press conference that the offense has to \"be able to run it, when we want to run it.\"\n\nIn pass protection, the Colts were steadier, ranking tied for ninth in pass-blocking efficiency throughout the season. In terms of pure pressure rate, the Colts ranked ninth as well.\n\nThe only free agent among the Colts' starting five from last season is right tackle Braden Smith -- although rookie Jalen Travis held his own at right tackle.\n\nThe Colts likely go into the offseason with their starting five already on the roster, but Ballard must improve the overall depth and competition up front.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: How did Indianapolis Colts' offensive unit compare to rest of the NFL?",

    "description": "Of the NFL's 32 franchises, 28 have reached the Super Bowl. Now meet the four teams still trying to get there.",
    "fullText": "The pinnacle of Roman numerals.\n\nWe’re talking about the Super Bowl, of course.\n\nOf the NFL’s 32 teams, 28 have reached the big game that spawns big theatrics. Quarterback Joe Namath predicted his New York Jets would upset the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl 3, then delivered with a 16-7 victory. The New England Patriots rallied past the Atlanta Falcons despite trailing 28-3 in Super Bowl 51. And at the halftime show at Super Bowl 38, Janet Jackson experienced her infamous wardrobe malfunction.\n\nFour NFL teams have failed to play in the big game, much less win it. That sad fact may change when the 60th Super Bowl is played Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, California, at Levi’s Stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nSo without further adieu, let’s meet those sad-faced teams.\n\nThe Browns have suffered heartache, none so intense as in 1986, 1987 and 1989 – their three appearances in the AFC championship game. They lost all three to the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe most painful one involved \"The Drive.\" Broncos quarterback John Elway drove Denver 98 yards on 15 plays and, with 37 second left in regulation, the Broncos tied the game at 20-20.\n\nThe Browns lost in overtime, 23-20.\n\nIn 1995, Cleveland turned its collective fury on Browns owner Art Modell when he announced he was moving the team to Baltimore. When the NFL awarded Cleveland an expansion franchise in 1999, some fans thought with Modell gone, the Super Bowl drought might finally end.\n\nSince then, the Browns have won only one playoff game.\n\nNothing captures the Browns’ version of dysfunction more than the team having had 42 starting quarterbacks since 1999. That includes Deshaun Watson, who the Browns acquired in 2022 through a blockbuster trade that turned out to be a blockheaded trade.\n\nWatson will go down in Browns infamy, a crowded room reserved for the likes of Johnny Manziel and Tim Couch.\n\nBut can Shedeur Sanders, the Browns' 42nd starting quarterback since 1999, lead the Browns to the Promised Land?\n\nThe Lions know abject losing, cruelty and squandered opportunity.\n\nCase in point: During the Hall of Fame career of Barry Sanders, the Lions won a single playoff game.\n\nIn 2023, the Lions reached the NFC championship game for only the second time in franchise history and at halftime led the San Francisco 49ers 24-7. Did we mention squandered opportunity?\n\nThe Lions lost the game, 34-31.\n\nLast year, the Lions entered the playoffs widely regarded as a favorite to win the Super Bowl. And they were 9.5-point favorites against the Washington Commanders in their playoff opener in Detroit.\n\nThen history reared its ugly head, and the Lions suffered a stunning 45-31 loss.\n\nThe team’s all-time playoff record is 9-15, which did not need to be updated this season after the Lions failed to make the postseason.\n\nThe Texans have not suffered the same shame and misery as have the Browns and Lions. After all, the Texans didn’t have their inaugural season until 2002, meaning they’ve only been eligible for 25 Super Bowls, counting the one being played this year.\n\nHouston is two victories away from reaching the big game. It would require the Texans to beat the New England Patriots in a divisional playoff matchup and then prevail in the AFC championship game against the winner of the divisional matchup between the Buffalo Bills and Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Texans have never played in the AFC championship game; the team has won only wild card games.\n\nThe team’s all-time playoff record is 7-8 − 7-2 in wild card games and 0-6 in divisional games.\n\nLike the Texans, the Jaguars deserve some grace. The team did not make its NFL debut until 1995. Remarkably, the Jaguars reached the AFC championship game in only their second season before losing to the New England Patriots.\n\nThe Jaguars have reached the AFC championship game twice more, losing to the Tennessee Titans 33-14 in January 2000 and squaring off against the Patriots again in January 2018.\n\nThe Jaguars led the Patriots 20-10 early in the fourth quarter on the road before Tom Brady rallied the Patriots to a 24-20 victory.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Which NFL teams have never played in the Super Bowl?

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFor most NFL teams, having your rookie class contribute in some way, shape, or form in Year 1 is a big bonus, and for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, most of their 2025 draft class did just that.\n\nNot only was it first-round pick Emeka Egbuka, but others in Benjamin Morrison, Jacob Parrish, and Tez Johnson all had their moments in 2025. So too, Elijah Roberts and Elijah Simmons.\n\nAs such, most can be expected to play key roles for Todd Bowles' team in 2026.\n\nThat is exactly what the franchise would have hoped for.\n\nBut how does the Buccaneers' draft class stack up against the rest of the NFL?\n\nESPN ranked all 32 teams' draft classes based on production, and the Buccaneers' came in at No. 16.\n\nMore:2 OC candidates perfect for Buccaneers and Baker Mayfield\n\nEgbuka started the season on fire, but faded towards the end of the season due to the many weapons at Baker Mayfield's disposal.\n\nMuch more is expected from him in Year 2. And the same can be said for defensive duo Parrish and Morrison. A second offseason to learn under Bowles will be invaluable.\n\nHe stepped up well when the Buccaneers' receiver room was depleted, and became a genuine weapon, so that will bode well entering his second season.\n\nIf all four improve even just by five percent, the Buccaneers will be in good shape entering the 2026 season.\n\nBuccaneers get what they deserve after Week 18 disaster\n\nWhy Buccaneers might have an Emeka Egbuka problem\n\nBuccaneers face huge contract decision with Super Bowl champion\n\nStunning stat shows why Baker Mayfield is biggest loser of Bucs coaching change",

    "fullText": "CHICAGO — Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman spoke with reporters Wednesday for the first time since the Irish were left out of the College Football Playoff.\n\nHe touched on multiple topics, including addressing some big additions through the transfer portal. Here are six things Freeman said:\n\nThe “Here Come the Irish” docuseries on Peacock recently showed the moment the Irish coaches and players found out that Alabama and Miami made the CFP over them.\n\nFreeman stared at the video screen with his mouth open. Players put their faces in their hands.\n\nFreeman said Wednesday that he thought the series properly captured the disappointment and confusion they felt. A month later, he said there’s still disappointment for the Irish, who had been ranked No. 9 or 10 up until the selection show. Miami, which will play Indiana in the national championship Monday, received the last spot in the 12-team CFP.\n\n“But you have to move forward, and that’s what we’ve done as a program,” Freeman said. “That’s what I’ve done as a leader. As I reminded the group in our team meeting on Sunday, it’s our responsibility to make sure we leave no doubt. We can’t blame it on somebody else. Although I may be confused about some of the criteria and the committee’s rankings and all those different things, it’s our job as we move forward to make sure we leave no doubt.”\n\nFreeman said he hasn’t second-guessed his team’s decision to skip a bowl game after being left out of the CFP. He said he was proud of how the captains made the decision and didn’t believe it was an emotional one.\n\nHe asked them again and again if they were sure about the decision.\n\n“Because I didn’t want them to regret it,” Freeman said. “And they were convicted in their decision, and I fully support them.”\n\nFreeman’s name has popped up a few times in this NFL hiring cycle. But he announced he was staying at Notre Dame on Dec. 29, when he posted on social media: “2026…run it back”\n\nFreeman noted that he always tells his players that the future is uncertain.\n\n“But everything I want and everything that I need personally can be achieved right here as a head coach of this program,” he said. “And so I hope this is something we have to address every year. I really do because it means we’re having a lot of success right here at Notre Dame.”\n\nFreeman said he has used discussions with NFL teams to gather information and learn how he can be a better coach. He said he didn’t know if an NFL job would interest him at some point in the future.\n\n“I don’t know enough about it,” he said.” Maybe sometime in the future, if it’s the right time and it’s what I think is right for me, then maybe I’ll pursue it. But I don’t love wasting time thinking about things that aren’t right in front of me, and so I don’t know what I will want in however much length of time from now. I know right now that I am as convicted and motivated to be the best head coach of the Notre Dame football program as I can be.”\n\nLast month, Notre Dame and USC put their 96-game rivalry series on pause because they couldn’t agree to the timing of the 2026 game. The Irish then scheduled BYU for a home-and-home series instead.\n\nFreeman said he believes the rivalry is “important for college football” and the athletic department leaders will work to get it back at some point. But he said the proposed timing wasn’t best for Notre Dame and its 2026 CFP pursuit.\n\n“I’m a competitive individual, right?” Freeman said. “And I want to go play anytime, anywhere, but at the same token, it’s important that I make decisions too that are best for the program. And to move a game that we were pretty sure was going to be Week 12 to Week 0 isn’t what’s best for our program. And they had to make decisions that were best for their program. I don’t blame them. They had to make decisions. We had to make decisions.”\n\nFreeman believes his family’s name was “dragged through the mud unnecessarily” over a recent interaction at a high school wrestling tournament.\n\nAn assistant high school wrestling coach, identified by the South Bend Tribune as Chris Fleeger, accused Freeman of battery at the event, saying Freeman pushed him with two hands. But the St. Joseph County prosecutor’s office said it determined through video evidence and interviews that no criminal battery occurred, and Freeman won’t be charged.\n\n“I was confident in this outcome because I know I did not intentionally touch anyone in a rude, angry or disrespectful way,” Freeman said. “I’m glad this matter has been thoroughly reviewed and resolved.”\n\nFreeman took issue of the initial reporting of the incident by the South Bend Tribune before all of the evidence was released.\n\nNotre Dame said in a statement Sunday that the wrestling coach verbally accosted Freeman’s son, Vinny, a senior who signed to wrestle at Cornell, and Freeman and his wife tried to remove their son from the situation.\n\n“I know I’m a public figure, and I understand the scrutiny that comes with that,” Freeman said. “That scrutiny should not extend to my children or any other child of a public figure.”\n\nThe Irish recently announced the additions of former Ohio State wide receivers Quincy Porter and Mylan Graham.\n\nPorter was the nation’s fifth-ranked wide receiver and the No. 1 player from New Jersey in the 2025 class. He had four catches for 59 yards in four games as an Ohio State freshman after missing some time with an injury.\n\nGraham, who was a five-star prospect and the nation’s fifth-ranked receiver in 2024, had six catches for 93 yards in 2025.\n\n“We knew a lot about them in the high school recruiting process, who they were, the type of players they are,” Freeman said. “And I’m glad we were able to get them.”\n\nNotre Dame also landed in the portal former Alabama edge rusher Keon Keeley, who was a five-star recruit ranked No. 2 in the 247Sports composite rankings in 2023. Keeley originally had committed to Notre Dame out of high school before flipping to Alabama.\n\nFreeman called it “a little delayed gratification.”\n\n“I’ve always believed Keon was a Notre Dame kid coming from his high school,” he said. “He’s such a unique individual. He’s a very talented football player. … When he came on his visit, I’m like, ‘Yep, it’s the same Keon we recruited a couple years ago.’ And he fits here, and I’m excited for his future.”\n\nFreeman said linebacker Drayk Bowen had surgery on the labrum in his hip, but he expects him to return in some capacity this spring.\n\nThe Irish expect linebacker Kyngstonn Viliamu-Asa to be back to full-go around the start of the 2026 season. He is recovering from an ACL injury.",

    "description": "Kevin Stefanski, a two-time NFL Coach of the Year, interviewed for the Dolphins' vacancy.",
    "fullText": "The Miami Dolphins announced their second interview in their hunt for a new head coach Wednesday morning when they confirmed Kevin Stefanski is a candidate for the job.\n\nStefanski, 43, is one of the more experienced options on the market after a six-year stint as the Cleveland Browns' head coach. During that run, he earned AP NFL Coach of the Year honors twice, making him one of 13 to be a multiple-time winner of the award.\n\nBut the two years that earned him that distinction were his only winning seasons in Cleveland and, ultimately, he couldn't overcome the Browns' Brownsiness. The team went 45-56 in the regular season during Stefanski's tenure and 1-2 in playoff games.\n\nWould he have more sustained success in Miami? Here's a look at Stefanski's case for the job:\n\nLast job: Head coach, Cleveland Browns (2020-2025)\n\nCollege: University of Pennsylvania\n\nHead coach, Cleveland Browns (2020-2025)\n\nOffensive coordinator, Minnesota Vikings (2019)\n\nQuarterbacks coach, Minnesota Vikings (2017-2018)\n\nRunning backs coach, Minnesota Vikings (2016)\n\nTight ends coach, Minnesota Vikings (2014-2015)\n\nAssistant quarterbacks coach, Minnesota Vikings (2009-2013)\n\nAssistant to the head coach, Minnesota Vikings (2006-2008)\n\nAssistant director of football operations, Penn Quakers (2005)\n\nStefanski's calm, cool leadership is his greatest strength. Amid a lot of tough circumstances in Cleveland, which included the team's fallout with Odell Beckham Jr. and Baker Mayfield, along with the disappointing acquisition of Deshaun Watson, the Browns never quite crumbled into chaos or discord.\n\nWhen Myles Garrett demanded a trade in 2025, the Stefanski-led Browns managed to navigate the situation and got a record-breaking season from the pass rusher in return.\n\nThat could be welcomed in Miami where discipline was sometimes an issue and Mike McDaniel admitted he struggled to find the answer, at times.\n\nThe concern is that Stefanski, an offensive-minded coach with a lot of experience coaching quarterbacks, cycled through 13 different starters in Cleveland. Players like Mayfield and Watson played much better football elsewhere. The Dolphins would be entrusting Stefanski to lead their uncertain quarterback situation to significantly better results than he managed with the Browns.\n\n\"I think ‘alignment' is a great word. Another way of saying it is, we are all on the same page. I think that's important. We know this, if we are plowing in the same direction, we got a chance. This thing is about a shared vision. It is not about what Kevin Stefanski wants for the Cleveland Browns. We have a vision of what this is going to look like moving forward and it's a collective vision.\"- Kevin Stefanski (via ESPN)\n\nStefanski stands out as one of the best captains on the coaching market. He's shown he has the leadership and demeanor of an NFL head coach. But if the Dolphins hope to see marked improvement on offense and defense, hiring the coach would mean there are high stakes in the hunt for coordinators and position coaches on his staff.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Dolphins Wire: Dolphins HC candidate profile: Could Kevin Stefanski right the ship?",

    "title": "My NFL awards ballot, from MVP Drake Maye to All-Pro Jalen Pitre",
    "description": "The PWFA All-Pro teams and NFL awards will be announced after the Divisional Round. Here's who I voted for.",
    "fullText": "The 2025 NFL season isn't quite in the books. But with the regular season finished, we can begin our postmortem.\n\nThat starts with league awards. As a member of the Pro Football Writers of America (PWFA), I get to cast my vote for everything from NFL MVP to All-Pro teams to digging deep to find a rookie center who made a hefty contribution (spoiler: there really wasn't one this year). This isn't the Associated Press vote, which has already been tallied and All-Pro teams have been announced. It's the PFWA version, which will roll out across a five-day stretch beginning January 19.\n\nSo, as is tradition, let's talk about who I voted for.\n\nThis was the two-man race everyone made it out to be. Maye won more games, generated one of the biggest turnarounds in NFL history and was an absolute runaway winner when it came to advanced stats. Matthew Stafford played a tougher schedule, was an absolute juggernaut at times and led the league in traditional stats.\n\nUltimately, Maye elevated his teammates more. As Bill Barnwell points out, three different Patriot wideouts ranked in the top-six when it came to catch rate over expected this fall. Either that's because Stefon Diggs (sure), Mack Hollins and Kayshon Boutte (eh....) are singular presences and some of the best receivers in the league. Or, it's because the guy throwing them the ball is putting it in places where they can make a play that other quarterbacks can't. Factor in Maye's scrambling ability and the drop-off in supporting cast between he and Stafford and, yep, that's my QB1.\n\nThis was a fierce battle between Smith-Njigba and division rival Puka Nacua. Smith-Njigba had more receiving yards, more yards per target and a slightly higher degree of difficulty via average target depth (11.3 to 9.4). Nacua had more catches, more yards per route run (3.73 to 3.61… no other qualified wideout was higher than 2.7) and a better catch rate.\n\nUltimately, JSN got the call because of what he meant to Seattle’s passing game. There was no Davante Adams to buttress him. This is a man who faced brackets throughout 2025 because teams weren’t afraid of anyone else in the Seattle passing game. Even as Sam Darnold faded he knew the easiest solution to his problems was winging the ball to his all-world wideout. That added degree of difficulty tipped the scale in the Seahawk’s favor.\n\nSchwesinger was an easy choice. No rookie shares the overall impact he had on the game, even if it meant toiling for a Cleveland defense that had to do a ton of heavy lifting.\n\nMcMillan was trickier. Tyler Shough's ability to adjust as games wore on and lead a depleted Saints offense to respectability made him a viable candidate, but he only made nine starts. Jaxson Dart and Cam Ward managed bursts of excitement against below-average play thanks to a lack of above-average veterans around them. Emeka Egbuka and Tyler Warren both faded with their teams' postseason hopes down the stretch.\n\nMcMillan, however, was a rising tide for an inconsistent Bryce Young. His ability to beat bracketed coverage to find space OR haul in contested catches through traffic made him an asset and was the difference between Carolina winning the NFC South or spending another year as an also-ran. Leading all rookies in receiving yards and receiving touchdowns didn't hurt, either.\n\nFrom missing nine games due to injury and a spot on the trading block to 100 catches and a positive influence on two different young quarterbacks. Olave proved his value in 2025.\n\nWilliams' slow starts are a concern, but he showcased his ability to rise to the moment and make the Bears a legitimate Super Bowl contender. That was more impressive than breakthrough years for Smith-Njigba, Maye, George Pickens, Will Anderson Jr., Javonte Williams or a handful of other viable candidates.\n\nLike running back, there are so many deserving candidates and so few spots. With apologies to Mike Macdonald, Mike Vrabel, Ben Johnson, DeMeco Ryans, Kyle Shanahan and Sean Payton, Coen's in-season adjustments to make a flawed Jacksonville team an absolute wagon down the stretch — maximizing Trevor Lawrence's strengths and stapling together a top-three defense over the last half of the season — made him my huckleberry.\n\nFrom 4-13 to 14-3 thanks to Maye's improvements and massive contributions from new arrivals in both free agency and the draft. That'll do it.\n\nKubiak has Seattle's defense playing like a furious swarm of bees at all times.\n\nNow, on to my first-team All-Pro picks. I'll break out a few selections I debated internally.\n\nQuarterback: Drake Maye, New England Patriots\n\nRunning Back: Bijan Robinson, Atlanta Falcons and Jonathan Taylor, Indianapolis Colts\n\nTailback is a position with two available slots and at least five worthy candidates. It hurt to leave Christian McCaffrey off the list, but his below-average running — minus-166 rushing yards over expected (RYOE) were worst in the NFL — was enough to elevate Taylor to the first team. While the Colts' star faded down the stretch he was also hamstrung by declining quarterback play that shrank head coach Shane Steichen's playbook.\n\nWide Receiver: Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Seattle Seahawks and Puka Nacua, Los Angeles Rams\n\nTight End: Trey McBride, Arizona Cardinals\n\nCenter: Aaron Brewer, Miami Dolphins\n\nGuard: Quinn Meinerz, Denver Broncos and Joe Thuney, Chicago Bears\n\nOffensive Tackle: Garrett Bolles, Denver Broncos and Darnell Wright, Chicago Bears\n\nDefensive End: Myles Garrett, Cleveland Browns and Will Anderson Jr., Houston Texans\n\nLet's talk about Anderson over Detroit Lions star Aidan Hutchinson.\n\nHutchinson led the NFL in pressures (89) and ranked fourth in sacks (14.5). But Anderson had 85 pressures in nearly 140 fewer pass rushing snaps. His 19.5 percent pressure rate was higher than any other full-time pass rusher but Micah Parsons (who got a first-team nod at outside linebacker despite missing the tail end of the season with a torn ACL) and Nik Bonitto (who made it at the other OLB slot).\n\nOn the other hand, Anderson got to clean up some of the chaos sewn by Danielle Hunter. Hutchinson got 11 sacks from rotational rusher Al-Quadin Muhammad, but no other Detroit Lion had more than six quarterback hits. A tough call, for sure. Anderson’s ability to do a little more with less made him the response to a question without a wrong answer.\n\nDefensive Tackle: Jeffery Simmons, Tennessee Titans and Zach Allen, Denver Broncos\n\nWith apologies to Cam Heyward, who is 37 years old and still logged more snaps in 2025 than any other interior lineman, as well as Jordan Davis and Derrick Brown (who is a 3-4 end but still fits the bill).\n\nOutside Linebacker: Micah Parsons, Green Bay Packers and Nik Bonitto, Denver Broncos\n\nInside/Middle Linebacker: Ernest Jones, Seattle Seahawks\n\nWant to hear something I hate? The PFWA has two slots for outside linebackers — ostensibly your edge rushers from the second level — but only one slot for an inside linebacker. That’s one honor for a field that includes Jordyn Brooks, Devin Lloyd, Jack Campbell and Carson Schwesinger. No matter how you fill this out, you’ll be left with a *bunch* of snubs.\n\nJones got a little credit for being the center of gravity behind the league’s top defense — though that could be overstating his skill because he was surrounded by demons in Seattle’s not-yet-determined level of hell. He was a stalwart in coverage, logging five interceptions and recording a passer rating equal to Derek Stingley’s (see below). While he didn’t offer much as a pass rusher (only 25 blitzing snaps), his run-stuffing presence and low missed tackle rate made him a reliable, set-it-and-forget-it presence in the middle of the field.\n\nCornerback: Derek Stingley Jr., Houston Texans and Quinyon Mitchell, Philadelphia Eagles\n\nI wanted to go with an unheralded name here. Did you know Donte Jackson yielded the second-lowest passer rating among full-time cornerbacks this fall? That Joey Porter Jr. allowed only five yards per target? That Tre’Davious White turned back the clock with his best season since 2020?\n\nBut, nope, Stingley and Mitchell were too overwhelming when it came to the eye test and in their numbers. Stingley allowed a 54.0 passer rating. On 43 percent of the targets thrown his way were caught. Both numbers led all full-time cornerbacks. Mitchell was one of the most-targeted cornerbacks in the NFL despite holding opponents to a 44 percent completion rate for testing him.\n\nThere was plenty of good defensive back play in 2025. Stingley and Mitchell, however, were the elite gliding over the good.\n\nSafety: Jalen Pitre, Houston Texans and Derwin James, Los Angeles Chargers\n\nNeither one of these guys is a pure over the top centerfielder. Both find ways to inject havoc into almost every drive. Pitre had four interceptions without allowing a touchdown in 58 targets this season, averaging -0.6 expected points added (EPA) per coverage play. James played at least 100 snaps lined up deep, in the slot, at linebacker or on the line of scrimmage and still finished with a 53.4 passer rating allowed, two sacks and three interceptions. The league is so much better when he's healthy.\n\nPlacekicker: Will Reichard, Minnesota Vikings\n\nPunter: Daniel Whelan, Green Bay Packers\n\nKickoff Returner: Ray Davis, Buffalo Bills\n\nPunt Returner: Chimere Dike, Tennessee Titans\n\nSpecial Teamer: Brevyn Spann-Ford, Dallas Cowboys\n\nIf a tight end finishes his season with more than a tackle per game, he's doing something right on special teams. Spann-Ford is a name you hear at Cowboys games more often than his nine catches in 2025 suggests.\n\nThat's all for now. I'll have my all-rookie team picks tomorrow.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: My NFL awards ballot, from MVP Drake Maye to All-Pro Jalen Pitre",

    "fullText": "The ultimate goal for every football player who laces up their cleats is to reach the NFL. That dream narrows quickly after high school, and even for those talented enough to play at the collegiate level, the odds of landing on a professional roster remain slim. But unlike several other sports, football requires a massive number of bodies to function, and scouts flock to end‑of‑season showcases for one reason: finding a diamond in the rough.\n\nTexas A&M has several players projected to come off the board within the first two days of the 2026 NFL Draft. For those athletes, skipping an All‑Star event might be the smart play. For others, these games represent a final opportunity to get in front of evaluators who could ultimately pound the table for them in draft rooms this spring.\n\nTaurean York has been a constant in Aggieland, staying through the coaching transition and emerging as the heartbeat of the defense. His football IQ, leadership, and command of the unit will be difficult to replace, but he played a major role in preparing the next wave of linebackers to take the reins. While he doesn’t boast prototypical size or elite speed, he consistently puts himself in a position to make plays and elevate those around him.\n\nAfter a historic junior season, York has officially declared for the 2026 NFL Draft and accepted an invitation to the East‑West Shrine Bowl. It’s a chance to showcase his instincts, intelligence, and competitiveness in front of NFL scouts one more time as he looks to solidify his place at the next level.\n\nInvitation Accepted@AggieFootball LB Taurean York (@TaureanYork5x) is locked in for the East-West Shrine Bowl! 👍#GigEm | #ShrineBowlWHOSNEXT 😎 pic.twitter.com/bOPLsOGjYv\n\n— East-West Shrine Bowl (@ShrineBowl) January 12, 2026\n\nThe 2026 East-West Shrine Bowl kicks off January 27 at Ford Center at The Star in Frisco, Texas\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes, and opinions.

    "description": "The Bengals grab a top-flight talent in a new mock draft.",
    "fullText": "Pass rush was once again a hit-and-miss issue for the Cincinnati Bengals in 2025, ranking in the bottom third in sacks. Injuries to Trey Hendrickson and Shemar Stewart were the main cause, though the Bengals did get contributions from Myles Murphy and Joseph Ossai.\n\nExpect the Bengals to address the area again this offseason, in part because Hendrickson is set to become a free agent again and may end up walking.\n\nThat’s the direction the Bengals go in the latest mock draft from Pro Football Focus, going with David Bailey of Texas Tech with the 10th overall pick.\n\n\"The Bengals selected one of the best run-defending edge rushers in the first round of last year’s draft in Shemar Stewart and selected the best pass-rusher in this year’s class with Bailey here. He leads all FBS defenders in PFF grade (93.1), pass-rush grade (93.9), pressures (81) and sacks (15).\"\n\nBailey transferred to Texas Tech after a solid three years at Stanford. He burst into the national spotlight with 15 sacks, helping transform Texas Tech’s defense and vaulting them into a top-five team, a Big 12 championship and a spot in the College Football Playoffs.\n\nIf the Bengals go with Bailey, they could have the potential to sport one of the pass-rushing duos in the league with Bailey and Stewart, two young and developing talents on the edge.\n\nThe Bengals recorded just 35 sacks in 2025. A healthy Stewart and the upside of Bailey could strongly boost that number going forward.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bengals Wire: Bengals land NFL draft's 'best pass-rusher' in new mock",

    "description": "\"Who's going to watch an NFL game on the internet?\" More than 31 million people, it turns out.",
    "fullText": "On Saturday, the Chicago Bears beat the Green Bay Packers in an NFL playoff game that had everything: a bitter rivalry, an old-school outdoors atmosphere, and a historic comeback (or choke-job, depending on your POV).\n\nIt also happened to be a (mostly) streaming-only game. Did you notice? Or care?\n\nI didn't. Except for about 30 seconds, when I was trying to find out what network was showing the game, and it took me a beat to realize it was on Amazon's Prime Video. Then I booted up my app and watched the game without any issue. Just like any other NFL game.\n\nIn 2026, \"Guy doesn't have a problem watching the Bears/Packers\" is a true dog-bites-man story. But that's why I'm writing about it here: Not very long ago, the idea of streaming a super-high-profile NFL game — and requiring NFL fans to \n\nNow it's a yawner: I was one of 31.6 million people who watched the game, the vast majority of whom streamed it (fans in local markets could use broadcast TV). That's a streaming record for an NFL game, and it's more than some other games got last weekend on conventional TV.\n\nAnd that tells you just how far sports and streaming have come.\n\nFlash back to 2013, for instance, and the idea of whether the \"internet\" — a catch-all term that included everything needed to get streaming video onto your screen, from web servers to fiber-optic lines to the router in your house — could support a big NFL game watched by many millions of people was an open question. \"Why Web TV Skeptic Mark Cuban Thinks Google Can Make the NFL Work on the Web,\" was an ungainly headline I tapped out at the time.\n\nBack then, the NFL and other sports giants were routinely streaming big events like the Super Bowl and World Cup — but only as a sort of secondary outlet for weirdos who didn't have traditional TV. And anyone who did stream sports had to expect to run into problems, like ESPN did when it streamed a World Cup game in 2014.\n\nA year later, the NFL put on a streaming-only game for the first time — but made sure it was a relatively niche one, and made sure that people knew it was an experiment.\n\nCut to today, and streaming is just a way we watch some football games now. Amazon pays a gazillion dollars a year to show one game a week during the regular season; Netflix has paid up to show a couple games on Christmas Day. A new deal the NFL struck with Disney last year will give the league the opportunity to sell even more games to digital players.\n\nAnd two years ago, the league passed another new threshold by moving one of its most valuable assets — a playoff game — to Comcast's Peacock streamer, where it was only available to paid subscribers. That one generated a ton of complaints from people who said they didn't want to pay another service to watch an NFL game — along with millions of sign-ups for Peacock, which showed they would.\n\nThe NFL is not ditching TV for streaming anytime soon. For many people, watching NFL games is the main reason to watch TV, and that gives the league a ton of leverage to extract ever-increasing fees from the likes of NBC and CBS. So they will almost certainly keep the majority of their games on old-time TV for the foreseeable future. But they're going to sell them to streaming platforms too — because they'll pay up to get them, and you'll pay, too.",

    "description": "Two of the NFL's least successful teams are working with multiple first round picks in 2026. How could Cleveland and New York fix things?",
    "fullText": "For three quarters of the NFL, the 2026 offseason has begun. That means Super Bowl hopes and dreams have been replaced by scouting reports and salary cap debates.\n\nThat means, for 24 teams, it's draft season.\n\nThe 2026 NFL Draft is modest when it comes to quarterback talent but still loaded with players who can change the fortunes of a franchise. Pass rushers, wideouts, cornerbacks and reinforcements on both sides of the trenches are waiting to hear their names called in April. Let's see who fits where and make some educated guesses.\n\nPlease note this draft was completed before Monday night's Wild Card game between the Houston Texans and Pittsburgh Steelers, so draft position among the top 24 picks was determined using the betting spread of that game (a projected three-point Texans win).\n\nGeno Smith can be kept for about $8 million more than his dead cap number. While he might be a useful veteran mentor, he's also the guy who flipped off his home fans in his first year in Las Vegas, so... Aidan O'Connell will probably be the experienced (well, kinda) hand that turns things over to a polished rookie next August.\n\nMendoza's elite downfield accuracy means he'll dazzle when it comes to advanced stats like completion percentage over expected (CPOE). He balances pinpoint throws with strong, quick decision making and enough athleticism to keep defenses wary of his run game. While he lacks elite physical traits, you can't argue with his outcomes. Las Vegas needs a winner -- ideally immediately given how quickly it's cycled through head coaches. Mendoza has been wrecking shop at INDIANA.\n\nMoore has more physical tools in his box than Mendoza, but he's not as polished as the Heisman Trophy winner. Still, it's not difficult to see how a quick release and the arm strength to whip a deep shot through a rapidly closing window make him a tantalizing NFL prospect.\n\nThe Oregon star can break down under pressure and will need some time to acclimate to the NFL. Picking up a wideout with the pick acquired from the Colts in the Sauce Gardner trade (or, later on, the second round acquired from the Cowboys in the Quinnen Williams trade) could find him some badly needed receiving help to ease his transition.\n\nJosh Sweat was one of the few bright spots in Arizona last fall, racking up a career-high 12 sacks in his first season with the club. Only one other Cardinal had more than two, and that was 39-year-old Calais Campbell.\n\nArizona needs help just about everywhere but tight end. Reese's versatility can help him plug holes in a few places along the defense but most notably as a pass rusher. He had 10 tackles for loss and 6.5 sacks in his All-American 2025.\n\nTexas Tech stud David Bailey is worth a look here, but Bain's playoff performance is too fresh to ignore. The 6-foot-3, 275 pound edge rushing monster had 5.5 tackles for loss and four sacks in the Hurricanes' first two CFP games, setting the stage for a push even further up draft boards.\n\nHis get-off and closing speed hit like a series of small explosions, making him an absolute nightmare to block and a haunting presence to escape. The Titans badly need an influx of talent; Bain may be the best raw prospect of 2026.\n\nTate's ability to create space with savvy route running, strong hands and upper crust ball tracking would be a rising tide for New York's cache of young skill players. Malik Nabers' double-teams would drop. Cam Skattebo (and Tyrone Tracy, if he ever re-enters the circle of trust) would face fewer stacked boxes.\n\nAnd Jaxson Dart, importantly, would have more options downfield that don't require him to lower his shoulder and run face-first into the concussion protocol (he probably still will. He just won't *have* to). Wideout isn't the team's biggest need, but it could be the catalyst that revives an inefficient offense.\n\nThe Browns allowed pressure on a league-high 46.5 percent of their dropbacks -- four percent higher than the second-worst Chargers, who were missing their starting tackles most of the season. Four different linemen who played at least 69 percent of the team's snaps are set for free agency. Spending room is sparse, in large part thanks to Deshaun Watson, formerly accused of more than 20 counts of sexual misconduct and what the NFL described as \"predatory behavior,\" and his albatross contract.\n\nThe easiest fix is to find a dynamic starter on a rookie deal. Here, Cleveland has its choice. Fano gets the nod thanks to his absurd power and athleticism at 6-foot-6 and 305 pounds. That athleticism boosts his recovery when beaten, which will be an asset when squaring up with rookie mistakes and elite edge rushers.\n\nTerry McLaurin is locked in, but Jayden Daniels' targets get iffy after that. Deebo Samuel is a pending free agent. So is Zach Ertz, who is coming off a season-ending ACL tear. Daniels badly needs a boost after backsliding in 2025 due to injury and lackluster play.\n\nTyson is a jetpack. The Arizona State star is good at just about everything, but shines hardest when it comes to breaking off cornerbacks at the top of his route and creating the space for clutch pickups. Sticky hands and elite recognition make him a dynamic closer on 50/50 balls as well -- though he could stand to bulk up a bit to withstand the rigors of a 17-game season.\n\nNeeds: CB, IOL, EDGE, LB, RB, WR\n\nNew Orleans could have used Tate or Tyson. Taking a player like Makai Lemon or Denzel Boston could be a bit of a reach here. Good news! The Saints also need help at another position that would boost Tyler Shough after a promising rookie season.\n\nEnter Love, who'd be a boon to a tailback rotation that got below-average returns from Alvin Kamara and Devin Neal last fall. His value as a runner (nearly seven yards per carry the last two seasons) and receiver (280 yards, three touchdowns in 12 games this fall) give New Orleans a dynamic replacement for Kamara and rising tide to the offense, albeit at considerable expense for a running back.\n\nReleasing Jawaan Taylor could save up to $20 million in salary cap space for 2026. Jaylon Moore hasn't been great and is only under contract through 2026. Josh Simmons was uneven and injured as a rookie, though his ceiling is massive. After Patrick Mahomes faced pressure on at least 42 percent of his dropbacks in his final two games of his 2025 (two games that washed Kansas City out of the postseason race), the Chiefs reload to keep their star QB comfortable.\n\nMauigoa is a rampart in pass protection, but he's truly devastating in space where his 315-pound frame flies upfield to demolish poor, poor linebackers. He's in the running with Fano to be the first tackle off the board in 2026.\n\nTrey Hendrickson won't be coming back, leaving the league's 25th-ranked pass rush in dire need. Maybe 2025 first round pick Shemar Stewart will get there, but he was always a project whose growth was further stunted by a truly pointless contract standoff last season.\n\nBailey brings proven production that Stewart did not, racking up a Big 12-leading 19.5 tackles for loss and an FBS-leading 14.5 sacks after departing Stanford for a hefty payday at Texas Tech. His explosive get-off and devastating closing speed means he can man the second level, but at 6-foot-3 and 250 pounds he's not so small he can't handle edge duties in Ohio (Joseph Ossai, for example, only has an inch and about 15 pounds on him). He's not a perfect fit, but Cincinnati gets a chance to course correct by taking an NFL-ready pass rusher in the first round.\n\nIn theory, Miami's next coach could use this pick to pump up his offense with another athletic marvel and make tight end Kenyon Sadiq a Dolphin. But whomever succeeds Mike McDaniel badly needs to address the league's 25th-ranked defense. And, lo and behold, Miami has a need at safety and Downs has slid out of the top 10.\n\nDowns can play deep or near the line of scrimmage and line up tracking slot receivers with ease. His NFL ceiling is \"Brian Branch, but better.\" He's a fixer, plain and simple, in a Miami defense in need of playmakers.\n\nDoes Jerry Jones truly want to shore up his run defense? If so, Clemson's Peter Woods could be the call here. Is he in the market for a Trevon Diggs replacement? There's Mansoor Delane and Jermod McCoy, among others. But the combination of need and cost savings at a high cost position instead shift the focus to Faulk, a high potential pass rusher who could lift a team that went from a top-four pressure rate with Micah Parsons in the lineup to the middle of the NFL pack without him.\n\nFaulk brings proven production (seven sacks in 2024 before this fall's down year) and the size Cincinnati covets up front (6-foot-6, 285 pounds). He's not a one-dimensional edge rusher, either; he has legitimate chops on the ground for a defense that ranked 29th in rushing EPA allowed in 2025.\n\nThe Rams only have three pending free agents who played more than 50 percent of the teams snaps on offense or defense. All three are defensive backs, including Cobie Durant. Darious Williams is 32 years old. 2026 presents a wonderful opportunity for LA to take the draft's first cornerback.\n\nEnter Delane, who led the SEC with 11 pass breakups and hauled in a pair of interceptions in 11 games. He can be trusted in single coverage on the sideline, with fluid hips and turn-and-go speed to keep up with NFL deep threats. His trustworthiness on an island could mean more blitzes for the Rams -- and an even scarier defense.\n\nThis is a pick that may hinge on Baltimore's next head coach. But this is a franchise with a definite identity. Landing a hoss like Woods who can set a bruising tone up front would help the Ravens get back to it.\n\nWoods, a 315-pound fairy tale monster with absurd quickness and athleticism, is set to jump up draft boards at the 2026 Scouting Combine. He lands in the top half of the draft here, pairing with Justin Madubuike to give Baltimore some world-class BEEF in the middle of its line and make life easier for the defenders behind them.\n\nLavonte David cannot possibly keep doing this forever. Please welcome his replacement, a taller, faster version of Lavonte David.\n\nStyles is a former safety who plays like it (complimentary), using elite athleticism to create problems at every level. He has the speed to turn and run with slot receivers and the physicality to meet a running back at the line of scrimmage and leave him with nothing but regret.\n\nWith Moore on board, several options to punch up his receiving corps persist. But while solid wideouts will last into Day 2, there may only be one chance to draft 2026's top tight end. With apologies to Denzel Boston and Makai Lemon, Sadiq is the pick.\n\nThe Oregon tight end is an athletic marvel and solid blocker who can seal off running lanes or get out in space to deflect defensive backs. More importantly, he's got excellent speed up the seam and quick change-of-direction skills to snap off linebackers and slot corners. Pair that with solid hands and, baby, you've got a stew going.\n\nDetroit needs a pass rusher big enough to hold down the edge and the intelligence to react and adjust as plays unfold. The 6-foot-3, 265 pound Parker qualifies as a valuable counterweight to Aidan Hutchinson.\n\nThough his numbers tailed off after last year's absurd 19.5-TFL, 11-sack campaign, he remains a versatile piece with a high ceiling and useful floor. He's violent at the point of attack, using a quick punch and active hands to shed blockers, though he's fast enough to win with speed on the edge as well.\n\nByron Murphy and Isaiah Rodgers played well in 2025, but there's no such thing as too many talented quarterbacks in a defense as aggressive as Brian Flores'. Adding McCoy would create space to shift Rodgers to the slot, adding strength over the middle alongside a young player who can be trusted on the boundary.\n\nMcCoy's torn ACL kept him from shining in 2025, but his four-interception 2024 proved he's a shadow in coverage, rarely allowing space thanks to fluid hips, elite quickness and vital recognition skills. He's an asset in man coverage from the line of scrimmage, and erasing quick-outs is a specialty -- something that would be a boon for the Vikings' pressure in the pocket.\n\nThe Panthers are running out of time to decide whether Bryce Young can be their franchise quarterback. After Tetairoa McMillan and Jalen Coker made up 81 percent of their receiving output in a Wild Card loss to the Rams, it's clear Carolina could use help to maximize its young passer.\n\nLemon's size at 5-foot-10 is a concern, but putting him in a lineup across from 6-foot-4 McMillan and 6-foot-3 Coker alleviates that. More importantly, he gives the team another man coverage beater with elite acceleration and quickness who can thrive in the short/intermediate zone in the space McMillan creates.\n\nOhio State's Kayden McDonald could be an answer up front with Kenny Clark on the wrong side of 30. But cornerback is a more pressing need and a top-three prospect has slid into Dallas' range.\n\nNot a single defensive back in the Cowboys locker room finished 2025 with a passer rating under 99 when targeted. Terrell, with 22 breakups the last two seasons (and eight! forced! fumbles!) would be rain to that desert. With elite acceleration and lateral movement, he's difficult to shake -- even if he's a bit smaller than Jerry Jones might prefer at under six feet tall.\n\nSure, a quarterback would be nice here -- but Ty Simpson here feels destined to end up like Kenny Pickett before him. It could be a wideout, but with Lemon off the board Pittsburgh may opt to play into tradition and coach up a receiver selected on Day 2 instead. Thus, we get Banks, a massive lineman who can play multiple roles but, most importantly, can succeed Cameron Heyward and pair with Derrick Harmon and Keeanu Benton to give the Steelers' a terrifying young defensive front.\n\nBanks has to refine his game, but his raw talent would make him a tantalizing lump of clay for a franchise that's expertly molded defensive talent. He's explosive at the snap and elusive laterally, allowing him to shed blocks and contribute all three downs. While injury limited him to three games this season and dented his draft stock, he may be due for a pre-draft rise this spring.\n\nZion Johnson has been frustrating in his time as a Charger and headed to free agency. Jim Harbaugh can pluck a Big Ten star to replace him months after the Patriots ended his season by brutalizing poor Justin Herbert.\n\nIoane, Iowa's Gennings Dunker or Oregon's Emmanuel Pregnon could be the call here, but let's start with the Nittany Lion. He's a brick wall at 330 pounds and has the quickness and aggression to create space at the second level -- something Jim Harbaugh will absolutely love as he establishes the run.\n\nThe Eagles haven't been shy about taking a legendary offensive lineman's replacement early in the draft while he's still on the roster. Cam Jurgens was drafted in 2022 to take over for Jason Kelce. Now comes Lomu ahead of whatever Lane Johnson decides comes next.\n\nPhiladelphia's pressure rate allowed actually decreased between 2024 and 2025, but all was not well across an offensive front whose struggles tied into an overall regression this fall. Lomu is a high level athlete who adjusted to Big 12 play with aplomb, showcasing All-Pro upside for the right head coach. Given the Eagles' success with homegrown and retread blockers in the past, his upside is too much to pass up.\n\nWith a blocking upgrade secured in the top 10, the Browns take the next step to elevate whichever poor, unfortunate soul has to play quarterback next season. It's too early to write off Jerry Jeudy even after his disastrous 2025. Instead, he gets a little help -- and another big body alongside Harold Fannin Jr. to serve as a playmaking threat.\n\nThe 6-foot-4 Boston is a bail out machine on jump balls, but his biggest strength comes breaking off defenders in the mid-range. That would make him kind of a super-sized Kayshon Boutte. We've seen how nicely Drake Maye has leaned on Boutte en route to an All-Pro second season, correct?\n\nThe draft board has been kind to the Bears -- even at No. 25 they have a wide array of top-level prospects to choose from at positions of need. Secondary and offensive line help is waiting, but Howell's value for the league's 27th-ranked pass rush is massive.\n\nHowell led the SEC with 11 sacks. While he doesn't have an enormous frame at 6-foot-2 and 250 pounds, his versatile pass rushing attack makes him an asset even in Chicago's 4-3 alignment. His ability to use his speed to create leverage and then toss off blockers suggests he could help fix what ails the Bears.\n\nBuffalo could fall in love with a wideout here, but there will be time to address the position on Day 2. Finding a young stud who can keep the middle of the line chugging forward with both Connor McGovern and David Edwards headed to free agency, however, is a tougher call. Dunker could step in immediately to pair with O'Cyrus Torrence as a road-grading young duo at guard.\n\nThe Iowa tackle will likely kick inside due to his arm length but can hold his own on the edge if needed. More importantly, he's mean as hell, quick at the point of attack and difficult to move backward. So, pretty standard Hawkeye stuff.\n\nTrent Williams has to retire someday. We saw how lost the Niners looked without him in stretches in 2025. The Niners' postseason success has prevented them from at least a couple potential saviors earlier in round one, but they still get a good one here. Proctor is enormous; 6-foot-7 and more than 360 pounds.\n\nHe's got the strength to match that frame, but his athleticism belongs to a much smaller man -- including a 32-inch vertical leap despite being the same weight as a Smart car. He's solid as a shadow, and while pad level and lateral quickness will always be a concern with a player his size he should make an immediate impact if Williams doesn't return for 2026.\n\nAh crap, we let the Texans get another elite defensive prospect. McDonald is an anchor up front, damn near impossible to move at 326 pounds. But he's also blessed with an explosive opening salvo that fires him into gaps and shrinks pocket space from the inside-out. Now he gets to pair up with Will Anderson and Danielle Hunter.\n\nCould this be a spot for Alabama's Ty Simpson to serve as Matthew Stafford's apprentice? It's possible, but Allen's availability and the need to add dynamic, young athletic talent to the middle of the field makes the Georgia linebacker the pick.\n\nAllen can handle pass rushing duties as well as lock down the middle of the field in coverage or against the run. He's not huge at 6-foot-1 and 235 pounds, but he moves quickly and fluidity, rarely crossing himself up and sticking to receivers in coverage. He's also a bonafide thumper who can move Omar Speights into pending free agent Troy Reeder's role as a rotational presence.\n\nNew England's pass rush was a strength in its Wild Card win over the Chargers, but K'Lavon Chaisson is a free agent and Harold Landry turns 30 this summer. Reloading here would help create positional savings that will be vital once Drake Maye signs a record-setting contract extension.\n\nUiagalelei can break into the lineup as a pass rushing specialist while fleshing out his game. He's an athletic marvel who looks the part of an NFL star but still needs to refine his game. But with power and speed in droves, he'd bring a stable floor to a position of need for Mike Vrabel.\n\nCisse's turn-and-run ability and elite acceleration suggest he's going to be an absolute darling at the combine. That raw athletic ability is backed by an inconsistent approach -- his 78.9 passer rating in Columbia last season was solid but his 20-plus yards allowed per reception were not. Fortunately, he lands here with a head coach capable of extracting the very best from him.\n\nCisse occasionally plays over-excited, biting on double-moves and adding some boom-bust to his game. Mike Macdonald can fix that. If he can, there's a player with All-Pro potential waiting underneath.\n\nAlex Singleton is a pending free agent on the wrong side of 30. Denver needs a running mate next to Dre Greenlaw in the middle of the field. Hill can do that.\n\nThe Texas star is a smart linebacker who identifies plays and gets where he needs to be to stop them. His coverage continues to develop, but that's a weakness that the rest of the Broncos' defense can help cover as he develops it into a strength.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: NFL mock draft: Can Jets, Browns double-dips save their franchises?",

    "description": "The refrain on Brian Rolapp from NFL insiders was: smart, good business sense, not a golf guy.",
    "fullText": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - A guess is that Brian Rolapp, the newish PGA Tour CEO, will be at the SoFi Center up the road from here Tuesday night, when Tiger Woods's TGL team takes on Steve Cohen's other New York team in the second week of the second season of the made-for-TV golf league. He was on hand last week, for the season opener. Does it matter that this is indoor, nighttime golf, a game that has been played outdoors by day for centuries? It does not. Rolapp has his eye on the real prize: In the first week, about 700,000 live viewers watched on ESPN and its broadcast cousins. Decent. Maybe the second week will be better.\n\nCome Wednesday night, Rolapp will likely be at The Breakers, the gilded five-star hotel across the intracoastal waterway from here, for a Tiger Woods birthday bash for 300. If he knows anything about Woods, he knows this kind of event is torture for him, but Woods will be there, a smile on his face, raising money for his philanthropy, the TGR Foundation. If it's important to Woods, it's important to Rolapp. Woods is a member of the PGA Tour policy board, the Tour's Enterprise Board (the for-profit arm) and the chairman of the Tour's Future Competition Committee. In addressing these matters and more - the Genesis Invitational, the Hero World Challenge - Rolapp and Woods will be the greatest Zoom buddies. Does it matter if he could not tell Chris Como from Matt Killen, to cite two of Woods's instructors from recent years? It does not.\n\nA longish preamble to a tea-leaf read of what's going on here, in this whole path-back-to-the-Tour thing, with Brian Rolapp's name and likeness all over it. When Rolapp was named the PGA Tour's new CEO, shortly after last year's U.S. Open, the refrain among people who knew him from the NFL was this: Smart, good business sense, not a golf guy. Turns out that last part, originally meant as a dis, is actually an asset (depending on your view of Monday's news). Brian Rolapp's most significant task is to get people to watch PGA Tour events, in person and, much more significantly, on any screen of their choosing. If getting Brooks Koepka back in the fold is going to help Rolapp in this cause, then he's going to do anything he can to get him back in the fold. There's no reason for him to worry about how Koepka took the LIV Golf money when he could, how he hurt the PGA Tour by leaving, how annoyed rank-and-file players will be by this easy path back. He wants the eyeballs that Koepka will bring. Full stop.\n\nIn his effort to bring back Bryson DeChambeau and Jon Rahm (both U.S. Open winners) and Cameron Smith (winner of both the '22 Players Championship and Open Championship), the same logic will apply.\n\nWhatever happened, happened. We want 'em back.\n\nMonday's news is the opening salvo. Rolapp said in August that his goal is not \"incremental change. It's significant change.\" This is, really, the antithesis of how Augusta National and the Masters works, where the leaders there despise the word change and take all their direction from the word improvement. Golf doesn't have a tradition of \"significant change.\" Rolapp might not know and surely does not care.\n\nWhen the LIV-Tour war first heated up in the summer of ‘22, Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour commissioner, said, \"I am not naive; if this is an arms race and if the only weapons here are dollar bills, the PGA Tour can’t compete.\" That sounded deeply true at the time. Rolapp is here to tell you: Dollar bills are not the only weapons in the LIV-PGA Tour battle. The PGA Tour offers something LIV Golf does not and that is the freedom to make your own schedule. The door to Koepka's return began with that.\n\nAs Rolapp tries to find a path back to the PGA Tour for Bryson DeChambeau and Jon Rahm and Cameron Smith, the same logic will apply. DeChambeau has flourished under LIV and has some bad PGA Tour memories. With Smith, it's hard to know what he cares about. Rahm could be open to the play-where-you-want argument. But he'd have to leave a mountain pile of Saudi money to do it.\n\nIt's hard to imagine the Saudis just walking away from LIV Golf. Walking away is not in their cultural business makeup. They're too rich and too smart and too ambitious. But Rolapp is going to do everything he can here to weaken LIV Golf. Working with Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy and a few other key figures, he will surely pave some kind of narrow path back to the PGA Tour for Talor Gooch, Tyrrell Hatton and Joaquin Niemann and a very few other LIV players who have won on the PGA Tour.\n\nAs for Sergio Garcia, Dustin Johnson, Phil Mickelson and Patrick Reed, all winners of major events, I'm guessing Rolapp has less interest in them or he would have expanded the terms in Monday's news. Mickelson is 55 and he has expressed such disdain for the PGA Tour it's hard to imagine him coming back. Woods has never been fond of Sergio Garcia so it's not likely he pushed Rolapp to make it easy for him to return. Patrick Reed's rules debacles made him a PGA Tour outsider. As for Dustin Johnson, whoever knows with him? He can play in the Masters forever. His father-in-law is Wayne Gretzky. He has all the jet skis he needs.\n\nRolapp cannot kill LIV Golf, as the NFL helped kill off the USFL in 1986. But he can weaken it.

The 49ers ran all over the Packers, as Raheem Mostert produced a historic stat line, giving the Packers' offense no chance to make the game close.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nKevin Durant said it best a decade ago — moms are the real MVPs.\n\nFor C.J. Stroud, that sentiment remains the foundation of a career that continues to defy the odds. After an historic rookie campaign, Stroud has solidified himself as the face of the Houston Texans, orchestrating a stunning late-season surge in 2025. Despite a 3-5 start to the year, Stroud led the Texans to nine straight wins to close the regular season, finishing 12-5 and securing a third consecutive trip to the postseason.\n\nStroud already knows what it takes to succeed on the big stage. In 2023, he became the youngest quarterback in NFL history to win a playoff game when the Texans routed the Browns in the Wild Card round. Now a seasoned veteran of the January spotlight, Stroud has won two playoff games in his first two seasons.\n\nThrough every record-breaking touchdown and every high-pressure drive, Stroud continues to credit his mother, Kimberly, for the resilience that has come to define his game.\n\nFamily ❤️💙 pic.twitter.com/K6qwCA6E5q\n\nStroud's close relationship with his mom has been well documented since the Ohio State product entered the league in the fall.

Stroud.\n\nThe two have a very tight relationship. Both have been open about the hardships they faced during Stroud's childhood due to the decisions of his father, Coleridge Bernard Stroud III. The quarterback's dad has been arrested twice and is currently incarcerated on a 38-year sentence.\n\nThe arrest of the patriarch put the family \"into financial ruin.\" The four children and Stroud's mother were close to being homeless as a result.\n\n“My mom, she had to play both roles for me for a while — mother and father,\" Stroud said during the NFL Draft. \"I’m super blessed to have a mother like I do.”\n\nWith Stroud's father mostly absent during the quarterback's adolescence, it caused Stroud to mature at a young age — something that helped mold Stroud into the man he is today.\n\n\"He had a choice when his father went away,\" Stroud's mother said. \"He was going to let that motivate him and be the best or he was going to succumb to it and become a statistic of a kid whose parent did something they shouldn’t.\n\n\"I sit and I’m amazed at how resilient he is. C.J. is the most amazing human I have ever met.\"\n\nMORE: Why is C.J. Stroud's dad in prison?\n\nIn November 2023, Kimberly and C.J. launched the C.J. Stroud Foundation, a non-profit organization that helps single mothers, children of incarcerated parents, and criminal justice reform.\n\n\"There’s a lot of different passions that [C.J.] has ... [helping] single moms [is one of them] since I was a single mom,\" Stroud's mother said. \"We all started crying [during the event] because a mom, her husband’s in prison ... same situation.\n\n\"I’m really grateful that C.J. has taken the step … for a young voice in our generation to shed light on some of the issues that go on in this world.\"",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Chargers’ loss to the New England Patriots reignited frustration around one of the NFL’s most talented yet inconsistent teams.\n\nDespite having a franchise quarterback in Justin Herbert, the offense once again looked flat and out of rhythm.\n\nThe Chargers failed to find any real momentum, continuing a season defined by stalled drives and missed opportunities.\n\nThe lack of creativity under offensive coordinator Greg Roman drew plenty of criticism, and the team’s fans voiced their frustration online.\n\nAmong them was a familiar name from another sport who has supported Herbert for years but couldn’t hide his disappointment this time.\n\nPGA Tour golfer Michael Kim, a long-time Chargers fan, summed up the feelings of many supporters with his post on social media.\n\n“I’ve been a big fan and supporter of Justin Herbert, but this was really disappointing,” Kim wrote.\n\n“Not smart enough to know if it’s Greg Roman’s fault or his (prob both), but to put this offensive performance is just sad as a Chargers fan.”\n\nThe comment came after another game where the Chargers’ offense struggled to execute.\n\nDrives fizzled, play-calling looked predictable, and Herbert appeared uncomfortable for much of a difficult night against the Patriots.\n\nHerbert remains one of the most talented players in the NFL, but his playoff resume tells a different story.\n\nThe Chargers star has now made three postseason appearances in his career and lost all of them. Each defeat has added another layer of pressure to an already heavy burden.\n\nWhile Herbert’s individual numbers continue to impress, the team’s inability to translate that into meaningful playoff success has become a defining frustration.\n\nHerbert’s arm strength, accuracy, and poise are undeniable, but fans are beginning to question how long his potential can outweigh results.\n\nAs Kim’s comments showed, faith in the Chargers’ process is starting to wear thin – and until Herbert delivers in January, the criticism isn’t going anywhere.",

    "fullText": "The NFL’s Wild Card weekend will set the eight teams that will move on to next week’s Divisional Round.\n\nIt will also lock six more teams into their spots for the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThe five teams that lost this past weekend now know where they will be picking in the upcoming NFL Draft, with the Carolina Panthers now slotted into the 19th pick, leading off the playoff teams. Two of those teams — the Green Bay Packers and the Jacksonville Jaguars — traded those picks away, meaning the Dallas Cowboys and the Cleveland Browns now know where their second picks will be on the first night of the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nOne more team will learn their draft position tonight, when the Pittsburgh Steelers host the Houston Texans in the final game of Wild Card Weekend.\n\nHere is the updated order for the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nLos Angeles Rams (via Atlanta Falcons)\n\nNew York Jets (via Indianapolis Colts)\n\nDallas Cowboys (via Green Bay Packers)\n\nCleveland Browns (via Jacksonville Jaguars)\n\nTonight’s game between the Texans and the Steelers will lock in one of those teams into their draft slot. As things stand, the Steelers are picking 21st, and that is where they will land should they lose tonight.\n\nIf the Texans lose, they will slot in at No. 23, dropping the Chargers down to No. 21 and the Eagles down to No. 22.\n\nThe Browns, courtesy of the Travis Hunter Jr. trade, are locked into the No. 24 spot as Jacksonville is guaranteed to have the best record of any of the teams that lost during Wild Card weekend.",

    "fullText": "It was a fine frenzy in East Rutherford this past season, with the NFL slapping the New York Giants organization, coaches, and players with fines totalling nearly $500,000. That represents roughly 12.5% of the average yearly total across the league ($4 million).\n\nBut it all goes to a good cause:\n\nThe fines collected are donated to the Professional Athletes Foundation to support Legends in need and the NFL Foundation to further support the health, safety and wellness of athletes across all levels, including youth football and the communities that support the game.\n\nThe following data was accumulated through the NFL's operations department, compiled as part of their gameday accountability tracker.

    "description": "The Los Angeles Chargers are the perpetual disappointments of the NFL",
    "fullText": "When someone tells you who they are, believe them.\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers have tried telling us they shouldn't be taken seriously for half of a decade, and yet every year before the season begins, multiple folks in the NFL media world will get on their respective platforms and proclaim, \"Woah now, watch out for the Chargers - this is the year they stop being complete crap.\"\n\nThat year has yet to come. The Chargers were defeated handedly by the New England Patriots by the score of 16-3 in the wild card round on Sunday night. While the Chargers have made the postseason in each of the first two years of the Jim Harbaugh era, they have been blown out in both of their wild card playoff games by a combined score of 48-15 and have scored just one touchdown across those two games. That brings us to their polarizing quarterback, who turned in yet another playoff stinker.\n\nHerbert continued building his poor playoff portfolio on Sunday, going 19-of-31 for 159 yards and getting sacked six times. Dating back to the second half of the Chargers' playoff collapse to the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 2021 postseason, Herbert has played outright awful in the playoffs. In his last 10 quarters of postseason play, he has completed just 50.6 percent of his passes with one touchdown, four interceptions, and has been sacked 12 times. And while the Chargers' offensive line has been largely bad in 2025, Herbert did himself no favors against the Patriots, running into several sacks and shooting himself in the foot a fair amount of times.\n\nConsidering the flip that seems to switch in the biggest games for Herbert, he should be nowhere near conversations regarding the top five quarterbacks in the NFL. He is now 0-3 in the playoffs, and has yet to put together a quality postseason performance in six seasons. Now, he's been surpassed by the quarterback on the other sideline on Sunday. Drake Maye has been in the NFL for 20 months and just played in his first playoff game, and yet he is already more accomplished than Herbert. When you throw in what Trevor Lawrence did this season and the fact that he has more playoff success than Herbert, as well, the former No. 6 overall pick quickly starts sliding down the list of top quarterbacks in the league.\n\nUntil the Chargers, and their quarterback, find a way to play a complete playoff game and actually win in the postseason, they will not be taken seriously as a team who can make a real run - nor should they. They have become the Lob City Los Angeles Clippers of the NFL. Flashy in the regular season with many a tweet showing highlights with an eyeball emoji, but paper tigers that crumble when the games really count.\n\nEagle star defender reveals loss to 49ers may have been his last game with Philadelphia\n\nTimeline of drama between Philadelphia Eagles, A.J.

    "fullText": "SPRINGFIELD–For the first time since 2014, the Kansas City Chiefs are not in the NFL playoffs, and it’s a weird feeling down here, in Arrowhead South.\n\nSince the fall of 2015, the Chiefs had won 10 consecutive AFC West Division titles, and competed in the postseason each year. The height of KC’s playoff prowess came between 2019-2024, when the team reached the Super Bowl five times and won three Lombardi Trophies.\n\nHowever, the annual magic Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid are known for cooking up never materialized in 2025. Mahomes suffered a season-ending injury, a torn ACL, with three games left in the season, and watched as KC finished a disappointing 6-11, which was good enough to be second-to-last in the AFC West Division.\n\nSo, without their beloved team in the postseason for the first time, in more than a decade, how did Chiefs fans feel? Were they relieved? Upset? Indifferent? To find out the answers, I went to the Chiefs Mecca of the Ozarks, Coyotes Adobe Cafe. A.K.A. Arrowhead South.\n\nSure enough, I quickly ran into two fans — Deante Johnson and Jack Murphy. Both guys were about college age and shared their thoughts on having no dog in the fight in the playoffs.\n\n“Every year can’t be a winning year, so, we just gotta sit this one out and hope next year’s better,” said Deante Johnson. “Definitely a speed bump, it’s definitely not over. I mean, if we still have Patrick Mahomes, Andy Reid, we’ll be fine.”\n\nMurphy echoed Johnson’s comments.\n\n“Last year was definitely heartbreaking,” said Jack Murphy. “Especially kinda getting pretty ran over in that super bowl, wasn’t fun, but as long as we have 15 and Andy Reid I mean, we can get right back there.”\n\nGlass-half-full kinda guys. The kind of fans you want to hear from. However, did they even care about the playoffs if the Chiefs weren’t in it? Or were they rooting for another team?\n\n“It’s been interesting,” Johnson said. “The NFL has definitely had a lot of unexpected teams come out, like Chicago…so it’s been fun to watch.”\n\nMurphy concurred and even admitted he’d like to see a team from the NFC take home the Super Bowl crown.\n\n“The Seahawks, for sure,” Murphy said. “I think it’s a really great story. I really like their head coach, and JSN (Jaxon Smith-Njigba) is a monster.”\n\nAs for Coyotes management, they too were disappointed Kansas City’s streak came to an unexpected end, but they still drew a good crowd for Sunday’s AFC wildcard game between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\n“For a decade that’s all we knew, but this year is a little different,” General Manager Jared Presley said. “We actually have other fans coming in this year and today we actually filled up with a bunch of Bills fans and a bunch of Jaguars, so it’s kind of a change, it’s good to see, but at the same time we’re kinda heart broken the Chiefs aren’t here.”\n\nOverall, the fanbase is still a little sore they don’t get to see if their favorite team vie for a chance to claim its fifth Super Bowl title, but, as Deante & Jack stated, “as long as we have 15 and Andy Reid, I mean, we can get right back there.”",

Not only did it end their season, but it may have also marked the end of Moore's Ducks career, despite only being just 20 years old.\n\nSome experts suggest Moore would be right to return to Eugene, such as ESPN's Todd McShay. But Moore himself, however, is unsure.\n\n“I’m going to soak this moment up,” Moore told reporters. \"That’s most important. Just giving hugs and thank-yous to my teammates.

This is going to be a life lesson that a lot of people never get. We just got our butt kicked. Right? That's going to happen in life, right, and not just Dante. Every single person in the locker room, every coach, every person can learn, 'Hey, how do you respond to that?' Some people crawl into a hole, right, don't face the music.”\n\nIt's unclear when Moore will definitively decide his future.

    "description": "Here is an in-depth look at each team, from how their 2025 season went and what their salary cap and free agent situations look like to their draft capital and glaring needs.",
    "fullText": "The NFL offseason has begun, including for some of the league's most high-profile franchises.\n\nHere is an in-depth look at each team, from how their 2025 season went and what their salary cap and free agent situations look like to their draft capital and glaring needs.\n\nAFC East: Bills | Dolphins | Patriots | Jets \nAFC North: Ravens | Bengals | Browns | Steelers \nAFC South: Texans | Colts | Jaguars | Titans \nAFC West: Broncos | Chiefs | Raiders | Chargers \nNFC East: Cowboys | Giants | Eagles | Commanders \nNFC North: Bears | Lions | Packers | Vikings \nNFC South: Falcons | Panthers | Saints | Buccaneers \nNFC West: Cardinals | Rams | 49ers | Seahawks\n\n(Click the team name for the full preview.)\n\nThe Dolphins will start completely fresh with a new regime as the team fired head coach Mike McDaniel. At first, it seemed as if McDaniel might have done enough over the second half of the season to keep his job, thanks to an improved run game and the team never appearing to quit despite the rough start. Miami now has a chance to pivot from McDaniel’s Tua-centric style of offense, but due to the significant investment in that approach, it might not be a quick or easy path out.\n\nThe Jets are hoping that this timeline will mirror the Detroit Lions, where Aaron Glenn came from as defensive coordinator. Detroit went 3-13-1 in Dan Campbell’s first season before a 9-8 record in Year 2. Though unlike the Lions, the Jets will need to find a quarterback. Justin Fields was signed to potentially be that player, but he lasted until only Week 11 before he was replaced. With a ton of draft capital and salary cap space, 2025 could be seen as more of a Year 0 for the Jets and this regime.\n\nMany of the bones that made the Ravens a Super Bowl contender are still in place, headlined by quarterback Lamar Jackson. But Baltimore now has another offseason of figuring out what went wrong. Only this time, it comes much earlier than anticipated with a few more questions that need to be answered — including, for the first time in 18 years, what comes next at head coach after the Ravens fired John Harbaugh.\n\nAfter another disappointing, injury-ridden year, the Bengals will keep Zac Taylor as head coach and Duke Tobin as de facto general manager and try to figure out how to build out a defense and more offensive structure around their three best players, Joe Burrow, Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins.\n\nThis Browns’ season was never going to be about success in 2025. Cleveland seemingly hit on many of the non-quarterback 2025 draft picks — tight end Harold Fannin Jr. and linebacker Carson Schwesinger will be top contenders for Rookie of the Year on each side of the ball, if not outright winners — while the Browns picked up a ton of future draft capital, entering the 2026 draft with two first-round picks. Kevin Stefanski is out as head coach, but general manager Andrew Berry will stay on to oversee what the next era of the Browns might be.\n\nIt would have been nearly impossible to think the Colts’ 2025 season would end up here after how it started. The Colts were first in point differential through the first 10 weeks of the season, and 28th from Week 12 on. With Daniel Jones injured and signed to only a one-year deal, plus having no first-round pick, the Colts find themselves in a much tougher offseason situation than anyone could have imagined midway through November.\n\nIt’s impossible to overstate the success of the Jacksonville Jaguars in the first year of head coach Liam Coen. Thirteen wins and an AFC South title are more than most Jacksonville fans could have imagined, even at some points during this regular season. The Jakobi Meyers trade allowed all the offensive pieces to fall into place while Trevor Lawrence ranked fourth in EPA per play and third in success rate from Week 11 until the end of the regular season. The Jaguars were third in weighted DVOA by the time the season ended. Jacksonville got the most out of its talent and it still feels like there’s more to come. A Year 1 couldn’t be much better and expectations are sky-high for Year 2.\n\nThe Titans had hope after drafting QB Cam Ward with the first overall draft pick in 2025, but things never completely came together. Ward flashed, but a lack of talent, especially at receiver, kept Tennessee’s offense from finding its stride. Head coach Brian Callahan was fired after Week 6 with a 1-5 record, 3-14 overall in two seasons with the Titans. Now, Tennessee will search for the next head coach in an attempt to get the most out of Ward and build up a roster that has a young offense while featuring one of the oldest defenses in the league by snap-weighted age.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, this season might have been just a small step back for a perennial Super Bowl contender — a chance to regroup and go again. But given Travis Kelce’s age and the late-season ACL tear for Patrick Mahomes, and now grave domestic violence allegations against Rashee Rice, this feels like a bigger moment — the end of an era of this version of the Chiefs. It might not be, but for the first time in the Mahomes era, the Chiefs don’t feel inevitable. This offseason will be the first and an important step in trying to get that feeling back.\n\nThe 2025 Chargers’ season was an objective success. But it feels like they left so much on the table.Justin Herbert was incredible throughout the season, but couldn’t get the production to match. The Chargers lost both starting tackles in Joe Alt and Rashawn Slater, while the team had nine offensive line combinations that played at least 50 snaps together. This also felt like a missed opportunity for a defense that was seventh in weighted DVOA by the end of the season. Coordinator Jesse Minter could become a head coach elsewhere, which would force the Chargers into a defensive reset.\n\nAs good as Dak Prescott and the offense were, the Cowboys were one of the league’s worst defenses the entire season and ultimately fired coordinator Matt Eberflus. Due to the struggles, Dallas traded for Quinnen Williams at the deadline. Williams is a fantastic player and immediately made an impact for the Cowboys, but it cost a 2026 second-round draft pick, leaving Dallas with no Day 2 picks this year, and a single 2027 first-round pick. The offense wasn’t enough to make up for the defensive deficiencies and the Cowboys missed the playoffs in a season when playoff spots felt more wide open than ever.\n\nFor the third straight season, the Giants are looking at a top-six pick in the draft. While some of the young talent was tantalizing, the Giants didn’t have close to a full competitive roster. After going 2-8 this past season, Brian Daboll was fired as head coach. The Giants now need a new head coach, and have decided general manager Joe Schoen will stick around.\n\nThis was not the world-beating team so many expected to see after last year’s Super Bowl title. How the Eagles played in games was telling. In 2024, they were 24th in points per drive on their opening possession, but improved to fifth over the rest of the game. The 2025 Eagles were sixth in points per drive on their opening possession, but dropped to 25th on all following drives. The talent is still overwhelming. That was the case with a defense that was still second in EPA per play while developing multiple All-Pro-caliber players. But, also as the defense proved, this team needs to figure out how to make that talent work together instead of just relying on the talent to carry itself.\n\nAfter a season when everything broke right for the Commanders, just about everything went wrong in 2025. Last season, Washington went 7-2 in games decided by seven points or fewer. The Commanders were 0-5 in those games this past season. Washington finished the season in the bottom five of defensive DVOA. Now defensive coordinator Joe Whitt and offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury are not coming back next season. While the Commanders still have the bones of the impressive 2024 team — and a likely healthy Jayden Daniels set to return — this is a franchise that will have to step back and retool a bit earlier than expected.\n\nA 9-8 record is disappointing given where the Lions had been, but this is still a team that finished third in DVOA — it was not a total disaster. Detroit finished third in yards per play on offense, though there were times when the limits of Jared Goff as a quarterback were more exposed than in years past. A shaky offense forced Campbell to take over play-calling in the middle of the season and the Lions will look for a new offensive coordinator in the offseason. The Lions still had the eighth-best point differential in the league, better than NFC playoff teams such as the 49ers, Eagles, Packers, Bears and Panthers. It’s hardly a consolation prize, but this team is still on the right track.\n\nSlowly and surely, injuries chipped away at what made the 2025 Packers special. Tucker Kraft’s torn ACL in Week 8 eliminated the offense’s biggest weapon, a man-beater and yards-after-the-catch monster. Then, a torn ACL for Micah Parsons in Week 15 sapped the hope that Green Bay’s defense could cause enough chaos to lead the way. Those pillar pieces will return in 2026, which should again make the Packers one of the top contenders in the NFL. But after another disappointing early playoff exit, 2026 might need to be the season when the results actually follow. With a potential salary cap crunch and no first-round draft pick, the Packers are going to have to hope the players already put in place can be as good as they need to be in the long term.\n\nExpectations were high for the Vikings coming off a 14-win season in 2024. However, the main goal of 2025 was to get as much information as possible on quarterback J.J. McCarthy. Minnesota disappointed and also did not get a clear evaluation of McCarthy as a quarterback. Despite that, the Vikings still finished above their win total and over .500. That was mostly thanks to a Brian Flores defense that ranked third in DVOA. Flores is a free agent, who could be hired elsewhere as a head coach or defensive coordinator. If most of the pieces stay in place, the Vikings remain a well-structured team that is just average quarterback play away from contending.\n\nThe Falcons won the final game of the regular season to reach a three-way tie in record at the top of the NFC South. But Atlanta’s win sent Carolina to the playoffs, while the Falcons officially finished third in the division and fired head coach Raheem Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot. The issue with Atlanta over the past two seasons was a clear misevaluation of where the team was and how to build the roster around it. A four-game win streak wasn’t enough to salvage the season. Neither were the individual bright spots, like Drake London and Bijan Robinson. Even the defense impressed in stretches, but it was never enough to make the Falcons feel like a franchise with a coherent plan and path forward.\n\nAn 8-9 record might not feel like a win, but some offensive competence and competitive games would have been the goal heading into the season, and that’s what Carolina got. There are more building blocks in place than there were last season, and this is still one of the youngest teams in the league by snap-weighted age. There might not be a clear answer about the long-term potential of Bryce Young, who finished the regular season 28th in EPA per play, but there have been enough high marks that the team could feel comfortable getting one more season to figure it out. The Panthers sit at a much better spot than they did coming off last year’\n\nFraming the 2025 season as a success for the Saints would be a stretch, but there’s a lot more to like than would meet the eye. First-year head coach Kellen Moore laid a solid foundation for his offense, and the Saints’ defense reached the top half of the league in DVOA under coordinator Brandon Staley. Tyler Shough was 22nd among quarterbacks in EPA per play but was in the top 10 over the final five weeks of the regular season, when the Saints went 4-1.\n\nThe Bucs were 6-2 at their Week 9 bye and wound up missing the playoffs. There was a lot of attention given to Baker Mayfield’s dropoff after the bye, but the Bucs went from 13th in EPA per play to only 18th. However, Tampa Bay dropped from sixth in EPA per play on defense before the bye — aided by a strong run defense — to 28th post-bye. The Bucs can hope that better health leads to more success in 2026, but there should be some reflection on what went wrong and what needs to be fixed to keep the franchise moving forward. The Bucs have decided to retain head coach Todd Bowles, though they fired offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard, QB coach Thad Lewis and special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey.\n\nOffensively, things never clicked. Kyler Murray was in and out of the lineup with injuries, which ultimately ended his season early. Now there are big questions about his future with the franchise. There were bright spots on defense, like rookie cornerback Denzel Burke and free-agent signing Josh Sweat, but injuries hamstrung this team all over. Jonathan Gannon was let go as head coach after three seasons, none of them over .500, and a 15-36 record.",

    "fullText": "NFL power rankings: Ranking the nine teams left in 2026 playoffs, from Seahawks to Steelers originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NFL playoff field started with 14 teams. With five of six wild-card games in the books, it's down to a fine nine ahead of the Steelers hosting the Texans in Pittsburgh for the wild weekend finale on Monday night.\n\nThere were some classic shootouts and games that came down to the wire and three was the unlucky seed number with both the Eagles and Jaguars being upset at home on Sunday.\n\nWith the two top-seeded bye teams prepping for playoff action and the NFC and AFC conference games almost set, here's an updated comparison of the teams still alive to win Super Bowl 60:\n\nThe Seahawks won a tough NFC West from which the Rams and their opponents, the 49ers, also made the divisional round. They have a dominant defense, balanced and explosive offense and are well coached by Mike Macdonald and Klint Kubiak. They should be ready for the rubber match with San Francisco after losing to the 49ers at home in Week 1. The key is Sam Darnold and the entire team avoiding lingering turnover issues.\n\nThe Patriots showed they were a complete and playoff-tough team under Mike Vrabel when their offense was contained by the Chargers. Drake Maye still overcame some tough pressure and made the plays when they counted most. The defense also sent a strong message with a dominant start in the wild-card round. They are looking like the steady playoff winner they used to be with Tom Brady and Bill Belichick.\n\nMORE: How Drake Maye overcame turnovers to beat Chargers\n\nThe Broncos will get a tough draw against the Bills, but then again Buffalo's offense has hit snags when Josh Allen faces top pressure and coverage defenses on the road. Denver's defense will need to set the tone at home, where Bo Nix tends to lead the offense best. The Broncos will see the Patriots as expected in the AFC championship game as long as they don't get off to too slow of a start and play catchup to the Bills.\n\nThe Rams' defense has a lot of potential with its run stopping, pressure and coverage, but it has its share of holes. The good news, they got a rough game out of their system against the Panthers.\n\nMatthew Stafford and Puka Nacua kept sizzling and trying to pass well enough to outscore them is a real challenge. With L.A. getting over an early scare, it should be refocused to rebound stronger for the divisional round.\n\nMORE: Three problems Sean McVay, Rams must fix after beating Panthers\n\nThe Bills got over a massive playoff obstacle in Josh Allen's first road wild-card game by outlasting the tough Jaguars by making fewer mistakes in the clutch, leading to a 27-24 fourth-quarter escape. In the divisional round, Allen will look up and see no Chiefs, Ravens or Bengals still in the AFC playoff mix.\n\nAllen has proved to be the great postseason equalizer and then some when their running game and defense are off. He should be the most trusted big-play and clutch QB left in the field.\n\nMORE: Three reasons why Bills passed their toughest test vs. Jags\n\nThe Bears seem to keep living dangerously as the worst total defense in the playoffs and have been too dependent on getting key takeaways. It had to feel good that they could win a game when four fumbles by the Packers didn't go their way and had zero interceptions from Jordan Love.\n\nIt would be nice for Ben Johnson  if Caleb Williams and the offense to start faster instead of waiting to explode while exploiting the best passing game matchups in the fourth quarter. Getting the league's No. 3 rushing offense going early would help. They will be ready to be better all-around after getting valuable playoff experience to take down their archrivals at home.\n\nMORE: How Caleb Williams made Bears' history in comeback victory over Packers\n\nThe 49ers took out the reigning Super Bowl champion Eagles in Philadelphia with a gritty shorthanded defensive performance for the ages. They also had to adjust to yet another big offensive injury to George Kittle, grinding away with Brock Purdy and Christian McCaffrey with great playoff scheming by Kyle Shanahan. They might not have enough health in their favor to get to another Super Bowl, but their experience can't be ignored in a still wide-open field.\n\nMORE: Christian Mcaffrey shines with 2 TDs in upset victory over Eagles\n\nThe Texans have won playoff games in each of the previous two trips with C.J. Stroud at quarterback under DeMeco Ryans. They draw a tough even matchup against the low-scoring, defensive-minded Steelers on Monday night. They will need to get hot offensively and score more to advance and have a shot against the Patriots on the road.\n\nThe Steelers are hoping that Aaron Rodgers can have some throwback magic left in him at 41 with DK Metcalf returning to raise the big-play potential for their QB's still strong arm. But equal keys is finding a consistent running game and much improving the defensive communication. It might be asking too much for the Steelers to win ugly more than once.",

Join the discussion in the comments below.\n\nHere is some basic information to help guide you through the game:\n\nHow to watch the game – TV schedule and online streaming information;\n\nFollow along with 49ers fans at Niners Nation;\n\nEagles full regular season schedule;\n\nNote: This is an open thread. Discuss the game and stay tuned for new threads after each quarter.\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\n4Q – 2:54 [Eagles 19, Niners 24] — With the help of some penalties. The 49ers were able to take the lead back just before the two-minute warning. They opted to kick an extra point instead of going for two, but they missed and only hold a 4-point buffer.\n\n4Q – 8:00 [Eagles 19, Niners 17] — The Eagles were forced to settle for a field goal, but Jake Elliott was able to connect on a 33 yarder for Philadelphia to retake the lead.\n\n4Q – 14:52 [Eagles 16, Niners 17] — Brock Purdy connected with Christian McCaffrey for a 29-yard touchdown to take the lead for the first time since the first quarter. To make matters worse, Jalen Carter was flagged for roughing the passer which was a penalty imposed on the next play.\n\n3Q – 2:20 [Eagles 16, Niners 10] — After several three-and-outs to start the second half, the Eagles were able to get into field goal range, and Jake Elliott made a 41-yard kick to extend their lead.\n\n2Q – 2:50 [Eagles 13, Niners 10] — The 49ers had to settle for a field goal after Jordan Davis made two clutch stops to force them into fourth down. Eddy Pineiro nailed a 36-yard field goal to inch closer to the Eagles before halftime.\n\nNotable: 49ers TE George Kittle had to be carted off the field during the drive after suffering what appeared to be a torn Achilles.\n\n2Q – 6:08 [Eagles 13, Niners 7] — Dallas Goedert scored his second touchdown of the day on a nine-yard TD pass on 4th-and-2. The 16-play drive had a little bit of everything, including their first tush push of the game, and some Tank Bigsby carries.\n\n1Q – 6:16 [Eagles 6, Niners 7] — The Eagles offense was (surprisingly) quick to respond and scored points off a 10-play drive that was super run-heavy, and ended with a Dallas Goedert TD — his 12th of the season! Unfortunately, Jake Elliott’s issues don’t seem resolved as he missed what could be a very critical point-after attempt.\n\n1Q – 11:51 [Eagles 0, Niners 7] — Well, that wasn’t a great start from the Eagles defense. Vic Fangio’s group gave up a frustrating 61-yard catch and followed that up by allowing several more plays that resulted in the 49ers scoring the first points of the game. Brock Purdy connected with Demarcus Robinson in the back of the endzone for six.\n\nNote: if the tracker isn’t properly loading for you, you can CLICK HERE.\n\nA Twitter List by BleedingGreen",

    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers overcame numerous injuries to stun the Philadelphia Eagles 23-19 in the Wild Card Round. The 49ers lost tight end George Kittle and starting safety Ji’Ayir Brown but still managed to take care of business on both sides of the ball. It wasn’t pretty, but the 49ers are headed to the Divisional Round. The Eagles took a lead into the fourth quarter when the 49ers took their first lead on a trick play touchdown pass from Jauan Jennings to Christian McCaffrey. The teams exchanged touchdowns after that, and the 49ers were able to stop the Eagles in the final minute.\n\nThe 49ers will not travel to the Emerald City for a rubber match against the Seahawks. The NFL re-seeds after the Wild Card Round and the 49ers are the worst remaining seed. That also means the Rams will travel to face the Bears next weekend. The Seahawks are the No. 1 seed and had a first round bye.\n\nRecord: 23-31 regular season, 1-1 postseason\n\nThe 49ers and Seahawks have split the season series the past two years. The road team won both games this season, with Seattle securing the No. 1 seed with a 13-3 win in Week 18. The last time they met in the playoffs was 2023, when the 49ers won their Wild Card Round matchup 41-23.\n\nSpread: Seahawks -7\nTotal: 46.5\nMoneyline: Seahawks -330, 49ers +265\n\nThe 49ers did not reach the playoffs last year, but advanced past the Divisional Round each of the previous three seasons, and four of the past five. They had two Super Bowl losses and two NFC Championship losses in those games. This is the 27th time they have played in the Divisional Round.",

    "fullText": "The Jacksonville Jaguars clinched the 24th pick in the 2026 NFL draft with their wild card loss to the Bills — but that pick has been traded to Cleveland, so the Browns now have Pick No. 24, as well as their own Pick No. 6. Here's how the draft order looks after the start of the playoffs:\n\n13. Falcons (traded first-round pick to Rams)\n\n16. Colts (traded first-round pick to Jets)\n\n20. Packers (traded first-round pick to Cowboys)\n\n24. Jaguars (traded first-round pick to Browns)\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders earned the first overall pick by having with the easiest schedule of the four teams that finished tied with the worst record in the NFL, 3-14.\n\nDraft picks are awarded in order of lowest winning percentage, and the tiebreaker is opponents’ winning percentage, with the team that played the easiest schedule picking first. If two teams have the same record and same strength of schedule, division or conference tiebreakers are applied. If the divisional or conference tiebreakers are not applicable, or ties still exist between teams of different conferences, ties will be broken the following tie-breaking method:\n\nBest won-lost-tied percentage in common games (minimum of four)\n\nStrength of victory in all games\n\nBest combined ranking among all teams in points scored and points allowed in all games\n\nBest net touchdowns in all games\n\nThe 18 non-playoff teams get the first 18 picks. The six wild card round playoff losers get picks 19-24, the four divisional round losers get picks 25-28, the conference championship game losers get picks 29 and 30, the Super Bowl loser gets pick 31 and the Super Bowl winner gets pick 32.\n\nThe 2026 NFL draft takes place April 23-25 in Pittsburgh. The first round will be on Thursday night, the second and third rounds will be on Friday night, and the fourth through seventh rounds will be on Saturday.\n\nIndiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza is the betting favorite to go first overall. Other contenders include Oregon quarterback Dante Moore, Miami defensive end Rueben Bain, Ohio State linebacker Arvell Reese, Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss and Auburn defensive end Keldric Faulk",

    "title": "2026 NFL offseason preview: Philadelphia Eagles' Super Bowl window hinges on fixing a broken offense",
    "description": "Here's a look at the offseason work ahead for the Philadelphia Eagles.",
    "fullText": "The NFL offseason has begun, and Yahoo Sports is previewing the coming months for all 32 teams, from free agency through the draft and more.\n\nAFC East: Bills | Dolphins | Patriots | Jets\nAFC North: Ravens | Bengals | Browns | Steelers \nAFC South: Texans | Colts | Jaguars | Titans \nAFC West: Broncos | Chiefs | Raiders | Chargers \nNFC East: Cowboys | Giants | Eagles | Commanders \nNFC North: Bears | Lions | Packers | Vikings \nNFC South: Falcons | Panthers | Saints | Buccaneers \nNFC West: Cardinals | Rams | 49ers | Seahawks\n\n2025 season record: 11-6 (u 11.5 wins), first in NFC East, lost to 49ers in wild-card round, 13th in DVOA\n\nThis was not the world-beating team so many expected to see after last year’s Super Bowl title. Last season. Philadelphia battled with some inconsistency in the offense but found a groove by the end of the season. The 2025 version never fully got it.\n\nHow the Eagles played in games was telling. In 2024, they were 24th in points per drive on their opening possession, but improved to fifth over the rest of the game. The 2025 Eagles were sixth in points per drive on their opening possession, but dropped to 25th on all following drives. The 2024 Eagles figured it out, while the 2025 version couldn’t adapt. Offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo might take the fall for that, failing to replicate the work Kellen Moore did previously.\n\nThe talent is still overwhelming. That was the case with a defense that was still second in EPA per play while developing multiple All-Pro-caliber players. But, also as the defense proved, this team needs to figure out how to make that talent work together instead of just relying on the talent to carry itself.\n\nThe Eagles have just over $14 million in effective cap space, per Over The Cap. That ranks 16th. They’re fairly locked into this roster. Because of how the Eagles have structured their contracts, there’s not a lot of restructure potential — most contracts are pre-restuctured with small base salaries and option bonuses. If the Eagles re-sign Dallas Goedert early, they could create space by shrinking the $20.5 million figure that would hit the cap when his contract voids on Feb. 16.\n\nTE Dallas Goedert \nEdge Jaelan Phillips \nLB Nakobe Dean \nS Reed Blankenship\n\nGoedert led the team and was ninth in the league with a 27.8% target share in the red zone. His 10 red zone touchdowns were second only to Davante Adams. Jaelan Phillips was a defense-changer after the trade that brought him to Philadelphia. From Weeks 1-9, the Eagles were 14th in pressure rate. After Phillips was acquired, they ranked fifth. Dean has been excellent and was immediately put back into the starting lineup when he returned from injury, but the presence of Jihaad Campbell and the high rate of nickel defense will likely make Dean expendable in free agency.\n\nQuinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean are two of the best players at their positions, but the second outside cornerback spot was a hole all season. Adoree’ Jackson was one of the most targeted cornerbacks on a per-snap basis and the Eagles ranked 24th in DVOA against WR2s.\n\nEven if Goedert is re-signed, the Eagles should add a tight end to the mix. Grant Calcaterra was a negative as a blocker and did not make up for it enough as a receiver — though the Eagles were fifth in EPA per play from 12 personnel, which they ran at the 12th-highest rate in the league.\n\nDepth on the edge will need to be addressed. That was the reason for the Phillips trade and bringing Brandon Graham out of retirement. Neither of them is under contract for 2026.\n\n1st round \n2nd round \n3rd round \n3rd round (projected compensatory) \n4th round \n4th round (projected compensatory) \n5th round (ATL) \n5th round (projected compensatory)\n6th round\n\nThe Eagles have built their dominance through the trenches, and now they find Lane Johnson’s long-term replacement. Lomu moves well for his size, and has polished technique and can add even more weight and strength. He can learn behind Jeff Stoutland and the All-Pros they have along the line before taking over himself.\n\nThe Eagles went 10-7 against the spread in the 2025-26 regular season, but were only 8-7 ATS as a favorite. They were also a surprisingly poor 4-4 ATS at home. — Ben Fawkes",

    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks are headed back to the playoffs for the first time since 2022, and they’re going in as the betting favorite to run the table and win Super Bowl 60. They beat the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday of Week 18 to clinch the NFC West title and the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoff bracket.\n\nThe No. 1 seed comes with a first round bye, which will give Seattle time to rest and get some players back from the injury list. In their finale against the 49ers, they played without left tackle Charles Cross and free safety Coby Bryant. They got the win and it netted an extra week for Cross and Bryant to get healthy.\n\nSunday result: The 49ers upset the Eagles in Philadelphia to close out the NFC Wild Card Round. The Seahawks will host the 49ers in the Divisional Round.\n\nSaturday Packers-Bears result: The Bears advanced to the Divisional Round with a huge comeback win over the Packers. Green Bay jumped out to a 21-3 lead, but managed to blow it in the fourth quarter. Chicago scored 25 points in the fourth quarter en route to a 31-27 victory. The win means we’ll have to wait until Sunday to finalize the NFC Divisional Round bracket. If the Eagles beat the 49ers, Seattle will host LA and Chicago will host Philly. If the 49ers upset the Eagles, Seattle would host San Francisco and Chicago would host LA.\n\nSaturday Rams-Panthers update: The Rams won a wild one over the Panthers to open the 2026 NFL Playoffs. It does not tell us much more about the Seahawks Divisional Round opponent other than to eliminate the Panthers from the list.\n\nThe NFL re-seeds its bracket after the Wild Card round. That means the Seahawks will face the worst remaining seed rather than knowing it will be one of two teams. If all the higher seeds win in the Wild Card round, Seattle would play the No. 4 seeded Carolina Panthers. If all the lower seeds create upsets, Seattle would play the No. 7 seeded Green Bay Packers. It could fall anywhere in between depending on how the higher seeds perform, with the San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams also in the mix as potential opponents. The Seahawks could know their Divisional Round opponent as soon as Saturday night if the Packers upset the Bears. Otherwise, they’ll find out their opponent by the close of the 49ers-Eagles game on Sunday.\n\nRecord: 31-23 regular season, 1-1 postseason all-time\n\nThe teams split their regular season series, with each team winning the road game. The Seahawks won the Week 18 finale to clinch the NFC West and the No. 1 seed. The last time they faced off in the playoffs was 2023, with the 49ers winning 41-23.\n\n49ers @ Seahawks\nSpread: Seahawks -7\nTotal: 46.5\nMoneyline: Seahawks -330, 49ers +265\n\nThe Seahawks return to the playoffs after a two-season absence. They lost in the Wild Card round in 2022, and lost in the same round two seasons prior. The last time they played in the Divisional Round was 2019, where they won a wild card game and then lost to the Packers.\n\nThis marks the fourth time the Seahawks have earned the No. 1 seed. The previous instances were in 2005, 2013, and 2014. They reached the Super Bowl in all three of those seasons, and won it in 2013.",

    "description": "While the Browns only won five games in 2025, this one key stat may just prove for a brighter future in Cleveland.",
    "fullText": "The Cleveland Browns may have only won five games in 2025, but they may not be far off, and their future is bright.\n\nAs the NFL wildcard weekend continues, ESPN showed a graphic on the youngest wide receivers in the NFL, and the Browns led the league in one key statistic. What was that statistic?\n\nThey led the NFL in snaps played by a rookie, and they led it by a landslide. According to ESPN, the Browns had 5,971 snaps played by a rookie in 2025. This was the most by over 600 snaps played. The New York Jets were second on the list with 5,327 snaps played by a rookie this past season.\n\nThis makes sense when considering that rookie quarterbacks started most of the season for the Browns, a rookie led them in rushing and receiving, their starting middle linebacker was a rookie, as was one of their starting defensive tackles. The rookies played well this season, and that bodes well for the future of the franchise.\n\n— Mike Kadlick (@mikekadlick) January 11, 2026\n\nJust look at the Patriots. They are in their second season after landing a quarterback in the 2024 NFL Draft. They did not even start him right away and gave him an on-ramp to the field as a rookie. Now, they are AFC East champs and are in contention for a Super Bowl after winning 14 games.\n\nOf course, the key difference between the Browns and the Patriots right now is that the Browns are still hunting for their quarterback of the future. Well, and a head coach.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Browns Wire: Browns led NFL in one crazy stat that bodes well for their future",

    "fullText": "Jaguars vs. Bills radio coverage: Station, channel, streaming to listen live to NFL wild card playoff game broadcast originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe AFC wild card round delivers one of the most exciting quarterback showdowns of the weekend as Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills (12-5, No. 6 seed) travel south to EverBank Stadium to face Trevor Lawrence and the AFC South Champion Jacksonville Jaguars (13-4, No. 3 seed).\n\nThis game pits two of the league's premier signal-callers against each other for the right to advance. While Allen and the Bills bring years of deep playoff experience, they will have to contend with a red-hot Jaguars team that hasn't lost since early November and enters the postseason carrying an impressive eight-game winning streak.\n\nThe wild card tilt carries a fascinating historical footnote as well: the Jaguars are 2-0 all-time against the Bills in the playoffs, securing wins in the 1996 and 2017 Wild Card rounds. However, this is a completely different era, defined by the dynamic, explosive offenses led by superstar quarterbacks. Lawrence, in particular, has elevated his game down the stretch, leading the AFC's hottest team with an MVP-caliber run through the second half of the season, a stretch that saw the Jaguars averaging 34 points per game.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills, despite being the lower seed and playing on the road for the first time in the wild card round since 2019, are looking to finally reach the Super Bowl; with the reigning MVP Josh Allen at the helm.\n\nHere's how to listen to the matchup.\n\nNational radio channels: SiriusXM channels 225 (Bills), 226 (Jaguars)\n\nJaguars radio channel: 1010XL / 92.5 FM\n\nThe Bills and Jaguars can be found on nationally on SiriusXM, where listeners can tune into the game from any location. Along with the national channel 88, channel 225 (Bills) and 226 (Jaguars) will provide team specific broadcasts.\n\nThose in the Buffalo area can listen to WGR 550, which carries all Bills football games through the season. In North Florida, Jax Sports Radio 1010XL / 92.5 FM is the home for all Jaguars games.\n\nListen to every NFL Game live on SiriusXM, where new subscribers can start with a free first month.

    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos now know what to expect in a playoff atmosphere. This time, they have an edge: home-field advantage and the full force of the Mile High faithful (and thin air!) behind them. And they are ready.\n\nDenver played a lot of close games this season, which could help them come the playoffs, where most of the games come down to just a few plays. Quarterback Bo Nix talked about how this could help them in January.\n\n“I think we’ve been fortunate this year to play in a lot of close games and we’ve won a lot of close games,\" said Nix. \"It hasn’t been the pretty… The ones that you want. The flashy, big-time wins. The ones where you get to go over there and sit, rest a little bit in the fourth [quarter]. It’s part of it. Sometimes you have to go and play the tough ones. It’s better to win some of these tough ones than lose them, obviously, for our position. It has put us in a position to understand what winning football is like. We’ve played a lot of playoff teams in these tough situations.\"\n\nSome of the playoff teams the Broncos have faced this year include the Los Angeles Chargers, Philadelphia Eagles, Houston Texans, Green Bay Packers and the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Broncos went 4-2 in those games, with two of those wins and one loss being a one-score game; three games (Denver played two against the Chargers) were more than one score, and the Broncos went 2-1 in those games.\n\n\"A lot of them have felt a little bit what physical, competitive football feels like,\" Nix said. \"A lot of guys fighting for a seed or fighting to get in the tournament in general. I think it’ll help us. It definitely won’t hurt us. It’ll give us the experience and speed up the experience for some of the young guys like myself [to] give us the best chance to hopefully go in here and understand how to win some of these games.”\n\nCornerback Pat Surtain also spoke about the playoff atmospheres Denver has been in this year.\n\n“We had some playoff atmospheres this year where we had some adversity early on in the game and we find a way to bounce back and finish games,\" said Surtain. \"I feel like we are definitely battle-tested in that regard and we always find ways to win. Just in the playoffs, though, we can’t find ourselves shooting ourselves in the foot consistently. We have to find ways to really dominate and find ways to get a faster start. I think that’s what we need to focus on moving forward. As a team, we are battle-tested. We are strong as a unit and it showed over the whole season.”\n\nDenver's battle-readiness will be tested when they face their next opponent at Mile High in the divisional round.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL: Bo Nix and Broncos are battle-tested going into playoffs",

It was a move that became inevitable when head coach Dan Quinn stripped Whitt of defensive play-calling duties ahead of Week 11.\n\nThe Commanders hired a new offensive coordinator on Friday, promoting assistant quarterbacks coach David Blough. Don't expect Washington to promote an internal candidate for defensive coordinator.\n\nThe Commanders have interviewed three known candidates thus far. One of those candidates drew the attention of one of the NFL's top defensive stars.\n\nOne of the three known interviews is Chiefs' defensive line coach Joe Cullen. Considered one of the league's top defensive line coaches, Cullen has been with the Chiefs since 2022. When ESPN's Adam Schefter revealed that Cullen had interviewed with Washington, star defensive tackle Chris Jones had an interesting reaction on X.\n\nOh sh!+……. https://t.co/8b0bG5pSpR\n\n— Chris Jones (@StoneColdJones) January 9, 2026\n\nThat reaction would seem to indicate that Jones doesn't want to see Cullen leave Kansas City. Of course, who really knows?\n\nCullen, a former college nose guard at UMass, has been a coach since 1990. He's been an NFL assistant since 2006, working with multiple teams as the defensive line coach. He's been an NFL coordinator once before, albeit briefly. During Urban Meyer's forgettable NFL career, Cullen served as his defensive coordinator in 2021.\n\nThe Commanders have the No. 7 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft and badly need a pass rusher.

    "fullText": "The Chicago Bears continue to prove that they like to hibernate, but they do not die. After having six comeback wins in the regular season, they capped off yet another one in their postseason matchup against the Green Bay Packers, winning 31-27 in a stunning comeback victory to advance to the divisional round of the playoffs.\n\nThings looked bleak early, as the Bears fell behind 21-3 in the first half after Jordan Love threw three touchdown passes. The Bears offense sputtered too many times and failed to convert on multiple fourth downs as faith in the defense was at an all-time low. Things looked bleak, but the team didn't lose hope.\n\nQuarterback Caleb Williams and the defense rallied in the second half to turn the momentum, scoring 28 points to storm back and retake the lead. Key passes to Colston Loveland, DJ Moore, and Rome Odunze kept drives alive as the Bears took control of the game from the Packers. After Williams found Moore for the go-ahead score late in the fourth quarter, the Packers were unable to mount one more scoring drive.\n\nIt was the craziest comeback victory in a season full of them, and the NFL world took notice.

Carolina’s draft position is now locked into place at No. 19. The rest of the teams that lose this weekend will fill in slots 20-24.\n\nCarolina ranked near the bottom of the NFL in 2026 in sacks with 30, and edge rusher is absolutely a top need heading into free agency and the draft. Rico Dowdle was the team’s leading rusher, with 1,076 yards and six rushing touchdowns, plus contributed 297 receiving yards and a touchdown through the air, and he’s hitting free agency. Christian Rozeboom, the Panthers’ tackles leader who also had two sacks, three pass break-ups, a pick and a forced fumble, will also become a free agent when the new league year ends. The Panthers are projected to have about $39 million in cap space to work with this offseason based on the 51-man projection, but obviously when they can shore up these key positions through the draft, it makes long-term team building for success easier.\n\nHere’s the updated draft order after the Panthers’ Wild Card exit.\n\nLos Angeles Rams (via Atlanta Falcons)\n\nNew York Jets (via Indianapolis Colts)\n\nDallas Cowboys (via Green Bay Packers)\n\nCleveland Browns (via Jacksonville Jaguars)",

    "fullText": "The NFL playoffs have arrived, and 12 teams will duke it out in Wild Card games for a shot at the Divisional round. We've gathered everything you need to know about where to watch NFL Wild Card games, including live streaming options.\n\nThe Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks earned first-round byes, but the other 12 teams to make it to the postseason will battle it out in one of six Wild Card games. The NFC will see Los Angeles Rams vs. Carolina Panthers, Green Bay Packers vs. Chicago Bears, and San Francisco 49ers vs. Philadelphia Eagles showdowns. The AFC will feature Buffalo Bills vs. Jacksonville Jaguars, Los Angeles Chargers vs. New England Patriots, and Houston Texans vs. Pittsburgh Steelers games.\n\nThe most notable omission in this year's postseason lineup is the Kansas City Chiefs, who haven't missed the playoffs in several years and made it all the way to the Super Bowl for five out of the six past seasons. The Chiefs faced a tricky couple of months and ultimately lost their star quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, to a season-ending knee injury in mid-December.\n\nWhether the Eagles, the reigning champions, can go all the way again this year or whether there will be two fresh teams at Super Bowl LX remains to be seen. Keep reading to learn some of the best ways to tune into the Wild Card round, including global streaming options.\n\nThe NFL Wild Card games are spread across several networks and streaming services in the US, including Prime Video, CBS, FOX, NBC, and ESPN. Each network has its own streaming counterpart, which we'll dig into below, but if you're looking to watch every game (other than the streaming exclusive Prime Video match-up) in one place, then a live TV streaming service will be able to help you out.\n\nThe best live TV streaming service we've tested that carries CBS, FOX, NBC, and ESPN, in addition to other networks, is DirecTV. These channels are available in any of the streamer's Signature packages, but you can also find them in the DirecTV MySports genre pack. MySports carries around 20 popular sports channels and unlocks access to ESPN Unlimited. Local channels in genre packs sometimes vary by region, so it's a good idea to see what's available in your ZIP code before signing up. MySports subscriptions cost $70 a month, while Signature plans start at $90 a month. DirecTV offers a five-day free trial for new customers.\n\nDirecTV's MySports pack carries popular sports channels, from mainstays like ESPN to niche offerings like the ACC Network.\n\nAs we mentioned above, the Packers vs. Bears game will be exclusive to Prime Video. Subscriptions start at $9 a month, but you also get Prime Video access with all Amazon Prime subscriptions, which cost $15 a month. New users can get a 30-day free trial.\n\nAmazon Prime Video is a capable, competitive streaming service that's more than just a Prime membership perk. You can also \n\nThe Bills vs. Jaguars game will be broadcast on CBS. Paramount Plus is CBS's streaming counterpart. The Premium tier ($13 a month) is typically needed to unlock CBS live streaming, but NFL games are also available with the Essential plans ($8 a month). New users can get a seven-day free trial.\n\nParamount Plus is perfect for viewers who want to stream CBS TV shows, local NFL games, and tons of content from Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, and MTV. And if you get the premium tier you can also unlock ad-free streaming and access to Showtime.\n\nThe Chargers vs. Patriots game will air on NBC. Cord-cutters can live stream the game through Peacock. While you typically need Peacock Premium Plus ($17 a month) to unlock NBC live streaming, you're able to watch NFL games with the Peacock Premium ($11 a month) tier.\n\nPeacock is a convenient streaming source for hit NBC TV shows, Universal movies, and select sports like Sunday Night Football. The service also carries its own slate of original programming.\n\nThe Texans vs. Steelers game will air on both ESPN and ABC. ESPN's direct streaming counterpart is ESPN Unlimited, which costs $30 a month. While the cheaper ESPN Select tier unlocks some action, you'll need to opt for the Unlimited plan to watch this game.\n\nESPN Unlimited has everything from ESPN Plus, in addition to all that the ESPN linear networks have to offer.\n\nThe Rams vs. Panthers and 49ers vs. Eagles games will air on FOX. FOX's direct streaming counterpart is FOX One, which starts at $20 a month and comes with a seven-day free trial.\n\nAll games will also be available through NFL Plus, where subscriptions start at $7 a month (or $15 a month for Premium). However, games are only available on mobile devices, like cell phones and tablets, so we recommend one of the above streaming services if you'd like to watch the games on a TV. There's also an opportunity to bundle NFL Plus Premium with ESPN Unlimited for $40 a month, a reduced rate compared to subscribing to each service separately.\n\nNFL fans in the UK and other regions can watch every game through DAZN's NFL Game Pass. Subscriptions prices vary by region and plan, but the streaming service will host the entirety of the NFL postseason, including the Super Bowl.\n\nDAZN is the home of NFL Game Pass International, the only service offering live and on-demand access to all NFL games in supported countries outside the United States and China.\n\nFootball fans don't need to worry about missing out on any of the action just because they're traveling away from home. Viewers can keep up with their usual websites and apps from anywhere with the help of a VPN, or virtual private network. VPNs are easy-to-use tech tools that enable people to change their devices' virtual locations. This way, their usual services work from anywhere the same way they would back home. They're also strong ways to improve online security.\n\nIf you're not sure where to start, NordVPN is one of the best apps on the market. It's fast, user-friendly, and offers some solid security features. You can learn \n\nNordVPN is one of the top VPN services in the business. It offers excellent value with a strong selection of features and a low monthly price. A wide selection of international servers, high-end security, fast connections, and audited privacy protection have made the brand a household name in the world of VPNs.\n\nNote: The use of VPNs is illegal in certain countries, and using VPNs to access region-locked streaming content might constitute a breach of the terms of use for certain services. Business Insider does not endorse or condone the illegal use of VPNs.",

On the other side of the ball, Travis Etienne will churn out yards against a Bills run defense that is near the bottom of the league in every metric.\n\nThe Bills are just 31st in the league in defensive rush EPA and DVOA. Etienne finished the regular season with 1107 rushing yards, and the Jags will lean on their ground game to keep Buffalo's explosive offense off the field.\n\nJosh Allen's passing numbers wildly fluctuate due to game script and weather conditions. Since we have the Jags covering, Allen will have a neutral or negative game script, and this is the nicest weather he's played in since Week 12.\n\nTravis Etienne Jr. Over 64.5 rushing yards\n\nJosh Allen Over 225.5 passing yards\n\nJags QB Trevor Lawrence has scored nine touchdowns in his last 13 games and isn't afraid to run in high-leverage situations.\n\nTravis Etienne Jr. Over 64.5 rushing yards\n\nJosh Allen Over 225.5 passing yards\n\nTrevor Lawrence anytime touchdown\n\nSpread: Bills -1.5 (-102) | Jaguars +1.5 (-120)\n\nMoneyline: Bills -110 | Jaguars -106\n\nOver/Under: Over 51.5 | Under 51.5\n\nSince I'm taking the Jags on the small +1.5 spread, I'd also be willing to bet them on the moneyline. After all, they have the better defense and home-field advantage against a Bills squad that can't stop the run.\n\nScore prediction: Jaguars 25, Bills 24\n\nThe Bills have gone 4-9 ATS in their last 13 games as a favorite.

    "fullText": "A thrilling AFC Divisional Round game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Buffalo Bills at the end of the 2021-2022 NFL season led the league to change the overtime rules for playoff games, giving both teams a chance to possess the football. Previously, the team that won the coin toss could elect to receive the kick, and would win the game with a touchdown on their first drive.\n\nThe outcry after Josh Allen and the Bills lost that playoff game without getting a chance to touch the football in overtime led to the revised rules.\n\nSo as the 2025-2026 NFL Playoffs get ready to begin, let’s revisit those rules, because you never know when you will need to know them.\n\nAll playoff games that advance to overtime will follow these revised rules:\n\nIf a game is tied at the end of regulation, the referee will toss a coin to determine which team will possess the ball first in overtime. The visiting team captain will call the toss.\n\nBoth teams will have an opportunity to possess the football. This is the big change. Previously, as we saw in the 2022 AFC Divisional Round game between Kansas City and Buffalo, if the team that started with the football scored a touchdown, the game was over. Under the new rules, in that scenario, Buffalo would get a chance to match with a touchdown of their own, and if they did, the game would continue. Once both teams have had possession, the game then becomes sudden death. In addition, if the team that starts with possession scores and kicks the extra point to take a seven-point lead, the second team can win with a touchdown and a two-point conversion.\n\nIf the score is still tied at the end of an overtime period — or if the second team’s initial possession is still in progress — the teams will play another overtime period. Play will continue regardless of how many overtime periods are needed for a winner to be determined.\n\nThere will be a two-minute intermission between each overtime period. There will not be a halftime intermission after the second period.\n\nIf the game remains tied after two overtime periods, there will be a second half. The captain who lost the first overtime coin toss will either choose to possess the ball or select which goal his team will defend unless the team that won the coin toss deferred that choice.\n\nEach team gets three timeouts during a half.\n\nThe same timing rules that apply at the end of the second and fourth regulation periods also apply at the end of a second or fourth overtime period.\n\nIf there is still no winner at the end of a fourth overtime period, there will be a third coin toss, and play will continue until a winner is declared.\n\nThere are no instant replay coach’s challenges; all reviews will be initiated by the replay official.\n\nSuper Bowl LVIII made a little history under the revised playoff rules.\n\nSuper Bowl LVIII became the first playoff game under the league’s new overtime rules for the postseason, and those changes guaranteed each team a chance to possess the football in overtime. After the San Francisco 49ers kicked a field goal — more on that in a moment — Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs drove down the field and scored the game-winning touchdown on the final play of Super Bowl LVIII.\n\nThat made Super Bowl LVIII the first Super Bowl to see a lead change on the final play of the game.\n\nLooking back at how that unfolded, many wonder if the 49ers should have approached things differently.\n\nSan Francisco won the coin toss, and made the decision to receive the kickoff, despite a prevailing theory that under the new rules it made more sense to defer. With both teams guaranteed a possession, knowing what you need to score to win the game offers a competitive advantage, similar to how teams in college want to start on defense in overtime, so they know what they need to do on offense to win.\n\nInstead, the 49ers began on offense, and could only manage a field goal. That opened the door for the Chiefs to win the game on their guaranteed possession with a touchdown, which is exactly what they did.\n\nSpeaking after the game, San Francisco head coach Kyle Shanahan stated that the team had run through the various scenarios, and thought by starting on offense they would have the advantage if the game advanced to a third overtime possession, and sudden death.\n\n“None of us have a ton of experience with it,” Shanahan said. “We went through all the analytics and talked to those guys. We decided it would be better getting the ball because if both teams matched and scored, we wanted to be the ones to have a chance to go win it.”\n\nThe problem? The game never got to that third overtime.\n\nLast year, none of the playoff games advanced to overtime, so fans were not treated to another situation like Super Bowl LVIII.\n\nNor did they get a chance to see what, if anything, teams and coaches learned from how that game ended.\n\nAhead of the 2025 NFL season, the league decided to align the overtime rules for the regular season with the approach for the playoffs. However, that change was made “subject to a 10-minute overtime period in the regular season.”\n\nMeaning regular season games could still end in ties, unlike postseason games.\n\nLessons learned from Super Bowl LVIII seemed to come into play during overtime periods in the regular season. One example comes from when the Green Bay Packers and the Dallas Cowboys went to overtime back in September. Green Bay won the coin toss ahead of overtime but elected to kick, since they were now guaranteed a possession even if Dallas scored a touchdown.\n\nGreen Bay held Dallas to a field goal, giving the Packers a chance to win the game with a touchdown. But when their drive stalled deep in Cowboys’ territory, Green Bay was forced to settle for a game-tying field goal.\n\nOther example from this past regular season indicate that teams will defer in overtime under the new rules. In October the San Francisco 49ers and the Los Angeles Rams went to overtime, with Los Angeles winning the coin toss. Sean McVay and the Rams chose to kick, giving the 49ers possession first.\n\nSan Francisco settled for a field goal, but the Rams were stopped on 4th-and-1 to end the game.\n\nIn November the Carolina Panthers and the Atlanta Falcons went to overtime, with Carolina winning the toss. Quarterback Bryce Young declared “we want to kick that way,” which was incorrectly granted by the referee. A team can choose to kick, or which end zone to defend, but they cannot choose both.\n\nBut the Panthers indeed started on defense, forced a punt, and then kicked a game-winning field goal on the next drive.\n\nOne scenario that has not been tested yet? The impact of the two-point conversion. After Super Bowl LVIII Kansas City indicated that if necessary, they would have gone for two at the end of their possession to try and win, rather than kick an extra point and extend the game to a third overtime possession.\n\nShould overtime arise in this year’s playoffs, will the two-point conversion come into play?\n\nI guess we will have to wait to find out.",

    "description": "The Denver Broncos have a quality roster which gives them ultimate flexibility in approaching the 2026 NFL Draft.",
    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos finished their 2025 regular season with a 14-3 record, an AFC West title, and a first-round bye. Today, six members of the team were announced to have earned All-Pro honors. It’s been a long time since the Broncos have had a roster this strong. A big tip of the cap to Head Coach Sean Payton, General Manager George Paton, and the pro and collegiate scouts for helping reforge this roster in relatively short order despite significant limitations due to the implications of the failed Russell Wilson era.\n\nWith second-year signal caller Bo Nix on a rookie contract, ample cap space with the ability to create more, and at least five picks in the top four rounds, the Broncos certainly have great flexibility in how they approach the 2026 NFL Draft. However, what the Broncos eventually do come late April will be highly dependent on what happens in free agency.\n\nAs of now, several defensive starters or players who earned meaningful snap time are scheduled to be unrestricted free agents. Alex Singleton and Justin Strnad at inside linebacker, John Franklin-Myers at defensive end, and safety P.J. Locke. Another significant contributor, standout nickelback Ja’Quan McMillian, is scheduled to be a restricted free agent. I’d expect the Broncos to tender him at least at a second-round level which would give him a big pay raise next season.\n\nAdditional #Broncos to get All-Pro votes:\n\nFB Adam Prentice\nWR Courtland Sutton\nLG Alex Palczewski\nRT Mike McGlinchey\nOLB Nik Bonitto\nCB Ja'Quan McMillian\nPR Marvin Mims Jr.\nLS Mitchell Fraboni\n\n— Aric DiLalla (@AricDiLalla) January 10, 2026\n\nIf Defensive Coordinator Vance Joseph winds up being hired for one of the head coaching positions available, it’s safe to say there could be some big roster changes pending who the new defensive coordinator would be. I’d assume that would be Assistant Head Coach and Passing Game Coordinator Jim Leonhard, who is widely regarded as a rising star in the coaching community.\n\nKeeping him in the fold would likely allow for a smoother transition, opting to keep a lot of the same verbiage in place, but adding some more of his unique wrinkles and personalities into the mix defensively. Given the above, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the Broncos once again opt to utilize their first-round selection on the defensive side of the ball. Inside linebacker, unless they sign someone in free agency, seems like the easiest position on the roster where you could find a quality return on investment and immediate impact from a draft prospect.\n\nFor those of you who have followed Future Broncos segments this year—you all know it’s one of the better off-ball linebacker classes in ages. The Ohio State duo of Arvell Reese and Sonny Styles played tremendously this season and will likely both be Top 15 selections. Though Texas standout Anthony Hill Jr. and Georgia star CJ Allen would very well be in play for the Broncos where they are currently slated to pick. Either of those two would be phenomenal selections that would definitely brighten Denver’s long-term future at the position.\n\nTexas LB Anthony Hill Jr. will enter the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nHill is a projected day 2 draft pick. pic.twitter.com/x6pxGkoluW\n\n— Dane Brugler (@dpbrugler) December 8, 2025\n\nThe Broncos will pick no earlier than 25th overall pending a move up the boards in April. If Joseph is hired by another team as I discussed above, that would give the Broncos a third-round compensatory selection and six selections in the top 150 selections. That’s a lot of draft capital to round out the roster and address future needs.\n\nI’d expect the Broncos to continue their trend of focusing on the trenches. It’s been a premium point of investment since Payton was hired. Garett Bolles and Mike McGlinchey played great this season, but they aren’t getting any younger and it’s been ages since Denver has opted to invest in drafting a tackle. With extra early round selections, I would like to see that finally happen. If Franklin-Myers walks in free agency, finding another defensive end might be wise. Though I’ll say I’ve been impressed with Eyioma Uwazurike this season and think platooning him and Sai’vion Jones next year to replace Myers wouldn’t be a bad idea.\n\nDon’t be surprised to see Denver also add some depth to their secondary. At safety, Brandon Jones and J.L. Skinner will be in the final years of their contracts in ‘26. Additionally, Riley Moss and the aforementioned McMillian will be scheduled to hit free agency after next season as well. Part of the reason Jahdae Barron was selected last season was planning ahead, but the Broncos should be diligent finding another prospect with starting potential on the backend of their defense.\n\nAnd of course, the Broncos’ offense could always use more playmakers. Whether it’s running back, tight end, or wide receiver—raising the floor and long-term prospects of all those position groups would be wise. With extra picks on hand, finding a way to surround Nix with more talent would be a smart call.\n\nWhat do you think, Broncos Country? Do you have an early philosophy for Denver’s 2026 NFL Draft approach? Are there any particular players you are banging the table for with their first-round pick? Sound off in the comments and let me know.",

    "description": "One of Crystal Roure's last acts alive was to tell her 12-year-old son to get out of the house and call 911. Her family believes it saved his life.",
    "fullText": "As a single mom, Crystal Roure was fiercely protective of her children.\n\nSo when she started dating a handsome man from church, Crystal didn’t introduce him right away. In fact, she waited until they had dated for a full year before he met the kids.\n\n“She took her time,\" Crystal's sister, Stephanie Roure, told USA TODAY this week. \"She did have a happy glow that I haven't seen in a long time ... My sister trusted him and fell in love with him. She finally found her happy ever after.\"\n\nBut on Dec. 22, just two years after Crystal married Jason Kenney, he would end up killing her and shooting her 13-year-old daughter in the face in their Florida home − all over an argument about watching a football game three days before Christmas, according to the Polk County Sheriff's Office. Kenney later fatally shot himself.\n\nThe crime during the December holidays shocked the nation.\n\n“The 13-year-old girl begged not to be shot – ‘Please don't shoot me. Please don't shoot me,’” Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said at a news conference the week of the attack. “And he shot her twice.”\n\nNow as Crystal's family reels from grief and shock, USA TODAY is telling her story and how she used her final moments alive to save her children.\n\nFrom an early age, Crystal Roure showed ambition and a commitment to hard work.\n\nHer sister Stephanie recalled how Crystal did well in school and thrived when she got her first job at T.G.I. Friday's as a teenager, quickly graduating from hostess to server.\n\n\"What set her apart from others was she didn't just work for a paycheck ... she worked for the experience,\" Stephanie said. \"She worked for the knowledge. She worked to prove to herself she was able to do things and not give up.\"\n\nBut when she became a mom at the age of 25, \"everything she did from that moment on was for her children.\"\n\n\"She worked harder and longer,\" Stephanie said. \"And somehow she was superwoman. She managed to hold down a full-time job and being a full-time mother.\"\n\nThough Crystal had to juggle work and the kids all while being single, she didn't miss a school function, award ceremony or field trip. She also managed to buy a house all on her own, \"because she was a smart woman,\" Stephanie said.\n\n\"Her children were her world. She worked hard for them, to provide for them. She protected them,\" she said. \"They came first before anything.\"\n\nEarly in the relationship, Facebook photos show the pair smiling and kissing each other in many selfies. Other show them and the kids looking like a picture-perfect family, posing in front of a Christmas tree and at a baseball game.\n\nBut sometime after they married on Nov. 4, 2023, Stephanie said: \"My sister lost that glow she had.\"\n\nAt first, Stephanie chalked up the change to the fact that Crystal became pregnant with her third child pretty quickly after the wedding.\n\n\"I remember asking her, 'Are you OK?'\" Stephanie said. \"She said, 'Yes,' it's just this pregnancy was really kicking her butt because she was much older.\"\n\nThough Stephanie said she always had an \"ehh\" feeling about Kenney, she thought her sister was happy and safe.\n\nThat is until she got the worst phone call of her life.\n\nCrystal and her three kids spent the evening of Dec. 22 by the Christmas tree at their home in Highland City, just east of Tampa. Meanwhile Kenney was in his shed, drinking and watching Monday Night Football until about 11 p.m., Sheriff Judd said.\n\nWhen Kenney went inside the home and wanted to continue watching the game, a fight ensued. It became so scary that Crystal told her 12-year-old son to run to a neighbor's house and call 911, Judd said.\n\nAs the boy ran out, he heard the first gunshot. Responding deputies found Crystal dead inside, her 13-year-old daughter shot in the face and shoulder, and Jason Kenney gone. They also found a letter Crystal wrote to her husband telling him: \"You're drinking, you’re using cocaine again. This is not the way the family should be. You need God.\"\n\nThe 1-year-old daughter the couple shared was unharmed. The 13-year-old survived the gunshot wound after the bullet hit the bridge of her nose and deflected through the top of her head, Judd said.\n\nAfter shooting his wife and step-daughter, Kenney drove in his truck to his late father's home and called his sister to say he had \"done something very, very bad\" and that it was the last time they would ever talk, Judd said.\n\nDeputies tracked Kenney down to a shed on his father's property. When they called for him to come out, they heard a single gunshot and found Kenney dead inside.\n\nJudd said that a relative told deputies that Kenney had been beating on Crystal \"for a while,\" though the sheriff's office has no records of any domestic violence calls or charges. Jason Kenney had no criminal history, Judd said.\n\n\"He absolutely destroyed a family,\" Judd said. \"When you go in there, there is a beautiful Christmas tree with lots of Christmas presents under the tree, just like the nuclear family should be ... and it ends up this way.\"\n\nCrystal's family is leaning on each other as they absorb the shock of her murder and raising funds for the children. Crystal's 13-year-old daughter \"is doing well on her recovery\" and \"it really is a miracle that the bullet missed every major thing,\" Stephanie said.\n\nAs for any abuse leading up to the tragedy, Stephanie said it's possible but she wasn't aware of any.\n\n\"After they were married I know she said he was drinking a lot more but she said that he was going to stop and said he would get help with it. Obviously that didn't happen,\" she said, adding that when she went over to visit, Kenney would \"sit outside in the shed playing games on his phone and smoking his cigarettes.\"\n\n\"If there was abuse happening he must have scared her to the point not to say or do anything because the type of person my sister was she would have left at the first sight of trouble because she would protect her kids,\" she said. \"But that's a question we'll never have answers to.\"\n\nStephanie said she's angry that Kenney killed her sister and tried to kill her niece but that she's so proud of Crystal and her nephew's actions that night.\n\n\"My sister died a hero for protecting her children and getting my nephew out of the house to make the 911 call,\" she said. \"She did that. She saved their lives and by doing so my nephew saved his sister's life, and thank God the baby was untouched.\"\n\nStephanie said she is going to do her best to teach her 1-year-old niece all about who her mom was.\n\n\"I will never let these kids forget the love and strength and courage she had for them,\" she said. \"They will always know that she loved them and put them first.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Florida mom of three killed by husband over NFL game 'died a hero'",

    "fullText": "Super Wild Card Weekend in the NFL is built for chaos — and chaos creates opportunity for bettors willing to chase longshot value.\n\nOur experts have identified four longshot NFL picks with the potential to boost your ROI as three straight days of knockout football take center stage.\n\nTrevor Lawrence 3+ passing TDs (+350 at FanDuel)\n\nTommy Tremble anytime TD (+650 at FanDuel)\n\nDalton Schultz first TD (+850 at FanDuel)\n\nEach team to score 1+ rushing touchdown (+12500 at FanDuel)\n\nTrevor Lawrence 3+ passing touchdowns (+350)\n\nTrevor Lawrence has thrown three or more scores in three of his last four games. He’s also piled up 10 passing TDs over his last three home starts, with this pass-catching group playing its best football of the season.\n\nParker Washington has 347 yards over the last three games, Jakobi Meyers continues to move the chains, and Brian Thomas remains a matchup problem. Add in Brenton Strange and Travis Etienne as a receiving threat, and there are plenty of ways for this offense to score.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills are banged up in the secondary, with rookie Maxwell Hairston out and Jordan Poyer questionable, plus linebacker Terrel Bernard missing practice. If the Bills sell out to stop the run, Lawrence should be forced to throw — and that sets up well for another strong passing day.\n\nTommy Tremble anytime TD (+650)\n\nThis is a massive price for a clear-cut TE1 on a team that should be throwing more than usual as a double-digit home underdog.\n\nIn his first game without Ja’Tavion Sanders, Tremble stepped into the TE1 role and caught three of four targets for 38 yards and a TD at +500. Tommy Tremble ranked third in route share and logged a 90% snap rate, second among pass catchers.\n\nHe’s clearly involved yet priced like a TE2 with minimal usage. With Sanders still on IR, this should be closer to +300 or +330.\n\nAfter missing Week 18, Nico Collins returns to the Texans' lineup on Monday. But even with their star wideout back, we still need to consider tight end Dalton Schultz a live option to score the opener against the Steelers.\n\nHe’s only scored three times all season, but two of those have come in the past month. He ranks second on the Texans roster in red-zone targets across the year.\n\nWith the Steelers giving up 11 touchdowns to TEs this season, tied for third-most in the league, it could be a good Monday for the former Stanford man.\n\nEach team to score 1+ rushing TD (+12500)\n\nYou can’t write a longshot article without one true lotto ticket, and Wild Card Weekend sets up perfectly for a swing like this.\n\nAcross the six-game slate, we’re looking at a mix of run-heavy offenses, potential weather spots, and elite ground games capable of dictating terms through both scheme and talent.\n\nThis bet leans on proven touchdown producers like Kyren Williams (10), Rico Dowdle (6), Josh Jacobs (13), D’Andre Swift (9), James Cook (12), Josh Allen (14), Travis Etienne (7), Trevor Lawrence (9), Christian McCaffrey (10), Saquon Barkley (7), Jalen Hurts (8), and TreVeyon Henderson (9).\n\nIt’s a sprinkle-only play — but if Wild Card chaos hits the right way, this is the kind of ticket that can cap the weekend with a massive ROI.\n\nMake your NFL bets at FanDuel, America's No. 1 sportsbook! \n\nChargers vs Patriots predictions\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "fullText": "Are the NFL's overtime rules needlessly complex? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNFL overtime was supposed to make games fairer. Instead, it has become one of the most confusing and overbuilt systems in professional sports — especially in the playoffs, where the rules quietly change again and grow even more complicated.\n\nWhat should be a simple extension of the game now feels like a rulebook within the rulebook.\n\nOvertime still begins with a coin toss, and the winner isn’t just choosing who gets the ball — they can also choose to defer or even pick which end of the field to defend. Before a single snap is played, layers of strategy and technicalities are already in motion.\n\nUnder the current system, both teams are guaranteed at least one possession, even if the team that receives the opening kickoff scores a touchdown. That team must then kick off and allow the opponent a chance to respond. The only way the game can end immediately is if the defense scores a safety on the opening possession — another rare and oddly specific exception that fans must remember.\n\nThe postseason adds even more complexity. Overtime periods are 15 minutes instead of 10. If a team’s guaranteed possession is still ongoing when time expires, it simply carries over into another overtime period. The game is treated like a continuation of regulation, complete with three timeouts per team, two-minute warnings, and end-of-half clock rules. If the game remains tied, teams line up for yet another kickoff, with only a brief two-minute “halftime” if a second overtime is reached. And in the extremely unlikely event that four overtime periods are played, another coin toss resets the format yet again.\n\nAll of this exists in the name of fairness — but fairness has slowly been confused with overcorrection.\n\nThe NFL has rewritten its overtime rules multiple times over the years, most notably after Josh Allen never touched the ball in the Bills’ playoff loss to the Chiefs. That game sparked the guaranteed-possession rule, fundamentally changing overtime strategy. But in doing so, the league didn’t just tweak a flaw — it created a system that increasingly minimizes the need to actually play defense. Now, if you win the toss and have a capable offense, you’re almost guaranteed to at least extend the game, regardless of whether your defense can get a stop.\n\nAt some point, the league has to ask whether it’s designing rules for competition — or designing them around star players who feel they were wronged.\n\nIf the NFL is going to adjust overtime every time a high-profile quarterback is unhappy with how a season ended, it might as well take the next logical step and adopt the NCAA overtime model. College football’s system is cleaner. It’s clearer. And most importantly, it’s more exciting. Both teams know exactly what they’re getting: equal opportunities, immediate pressure, and a true test of execution in scoring situations.\n\nFootball thrives on simplicity — move the ball, stop the ball, score more points, win the game. The current NFL overtime system has drifted far from that. What was meant to be fair has become bloated, confusing, and increasingly disconnected from the core of the sport. If overtime is going to feel this manufactured anyway, the league may as well choose a model that fans can actually understand — and enjoy.",

This season, however, much of the attention has gone to Cleveland Browns edge rusher Myles Garrett, who set the NFL single-season sack record.\n\nMORE: Broncos predicted to cut ties with $12 million quarterback in 2026 offseason\n\nStill, one current NFL player believes others deserve credit for setting the standard before him.\n\nBroncos linebacker Nik Bonitto responded to a post on X supporting the view that Miller is better than Garrett.\n\nAt age 36, Miller tied DeMarcus Ware this season with 138.5 career sacks, ranking ninth all-time in NFL history and standing as the most by any active player. Miller recorded double-digit sacks in seven of his first eight seasons, though he hasn’t reached that mark since 2018. Over his career, he has earned three All-Pro selections and won two Super Bowl titles. He now plays for the Washington Commanders.\n\nMORE: Von Miller using former Broncos teammate as motivation to continue playing career\n\nGarrett, meanwhile, has totaled 125.5 career sacks at age 30, tying him for 20th all-time. He has posted double-digit sack totals in every season except his rookie year, has been named All-Pro four times, and won Defensive Player of the Year in 2023.\n\nBonitto and the Broncos have secured the No. 1 overall seed in the AFC and will await the outcome of this weekend’s wild-card games to determine their opponent, facing the lowest remaining seed.\n\nBroncos get completely buried in another NFL playoff prediction\n\nBroncos could get huge playoff boost with return of three starters\n\nGiants request HC interview with Broncos coach connected to GM Joe Schoen\n\nBroncos' Vance Joseph in high demand for head coaching openings",

The Panthers are the ultimate underdog, but they already have a win over the Rams under their belt this season.\n\nAn NFC North rival renews Saturday night when the Chicago Bears host the Green Bay Packers in the first playoff game at Soldier Field since 2018.

    "fullText": "The College Football Playoff semifinal at the Peach Bowl was a clash between No. 5 Oregon and No. 1 Indiana. It was also a clash between the No. 1 and No. 2 picks of Yahoo Sports' latest NFL mock draft.\n\nIn both cases, it's pretty safe to say who came out on top.\n\nIndiana reached the national title game with a 56-22 demolishing of the Ducks, taking a four-touchdown lead into halftime and coasting from there. Hoosiers quarterback Fernando Mendoza, the favorite to be the Las Vegas Raiders' first overall pick in a few months, was 17-for-20 for 177 passing yards, 5 touchdowns and 0 interceptions.\n\nAnd Oregon quarterback Dante Moore, the projected second pick? He was 24-for-39 with 285 passing yards, 2 touchdowns and 3 backbreaking turnovers. It's safe to say the performance didn't help the redshirt sophomore's draft stock.\n\nWhen asked about his draft decision after the game, Moore said he hadn't made a decision yet.\n\n“At the end of the day, I don’t know my decision yet.”\n\nDante Moore on his future ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/W1r22EaepO\n\n— FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) January 10, 2026\n\n\"I'm going to soak this moment up and, most importantly, give my hugs and thank yous to my teammates. But at the end of the day, I don't know my decision yet. I'm going to talk to coach Lanning and talk to my family and everybody, but at the end of the day I don't want to think about that right now.\"\n\nAs of now, Moore still looms as a candidate to go second overall to the New York Jets, but his performance on Friday laid bare some concerns around his game.\n\nAfter a rough freshman year at UCLA and a redshirt year under Dillon Gabriel last season, Moore had impressed all season with his arm strength, accuracy, athleticism and command of the Oregon offense. However, he was never pressured in the pocket like he was against Indiana, and the results were ugly.\n\n— Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) January 10, 2026\n\nOregon would surely welcome Moore back for a junior season and at only 20 years old, he still has plenty of time to get to the NFL. The decision is shaping up to be one of the biggest among all underclassmen in this year's draft cycle.\n\nAs for Mendoza, you can probably guess where he's going after a dream season in which he's led Indiana to a 15-0 record while winning the Heisman Trophy.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter years of Chiefs dominance in the AFC, there’s a new heavyweight making waves.\n\nThe Broncos enjoyed a splendid 2025 campaign, besting all but three foes en route to an AFC West crown and the top seed in the AFC playoff bracket. Denver’s success largely stems from its harrowing defense, which surrendered fewer points than all but two teams. The Broncos boast a host of gifted talents across their rearguard, from reigning Defensive Player of the Year Patrick Surtain II to linebacking standouts Alex Singleton and Nik Bonitto.\n\nSean Payton’s side fancies itself a Super Bowl contender. Its record would seem to support that assessment, as the roster looks to improve on last year’s defeat in the wild-card round.\n\nWith that, here’s what you need to know about the Broncos’ playoff schedule, including who they face next in postseason play.\n\nSN's expert predictions for NFL playoffs, Super Bowl 60\n\nNFL playoff power rankings, 1-14\n\nIt's currently unclear who the Broncos will play when they begin their pilgrimage through postseason play in the divisional round. They'll be matched up against the lowest-seeded team still remaining after wild-card play. Who will that be? It's anyone's guess at the moment.\n\nAfter finishing with a 14-3 record and outgunning the Patriots via tiebreakers, Denver landed the top seed in the AFC. That gives Sean Payton's side home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, as well as a bye week during the wild-card round. While it's unknown exactly what day and time they'll play when the divisional round starts on Jan. 25, the Broncos' game will be available to watch on Fubo.\n\nFor a limited time, you can get your first month of Fubo for as low as $59.99, a $25 savings.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New Orleans Saints may have a quarterback on their hands. Rookie Tyler Shough impressed in the first nine starts of his young professional career, completing 67.6% of his passes for 2,384 yards, 10 touchdowns, and six interceptions.\n\nNew Orleans was even able to win four of their last five games under the guidance of Shough, providing optimism that he can be their quarterback of the future.\n\nIn real life, Shough had to wait to have his name called until the 40th overall pick in the second round of the 2025 NFL Draft. But almost a year removed, would he be picked any higher?\n\nIn a re-draft of the 2025 NFL Draft, Bleacher Report's Brent Sobleski projected Shough to go No. 3 overall to the New York Giants, since Jaxson Dart and Cam Ward were both off the board with the first two picks.\n\n\"Tyler Shough performed better than any rookie quarterback this past season. A person can even argue he should have been the No. 1 overall pick when compared to his classmates. He slides to No. 3 based on one factor: upside,\" wrote Sobleski.\n\n\"Aside from age, he originally fell into the second round because of an extensive injury history throughout his collegiate career. He remained healthy in 2025, but that concern hasn't disappeared.\"\n\nDespite Sobleski's concerns, it's impressive that a second-round pick improved his stock enough in nine games to be considered a top-three pick just nine months later.\n\nIt's safe to say the Saints are pleased with last year's selection.\n\nMock draft has Saints landing explosive playmaker to pair with Tyler Shough\n\nSaints HC Kellen Moore responds to concerns about QB Tyler Shough's age\n\nSaints 'expected' to play first international game in new European country for 2026\n\nSaints owner Gayle Benson provides stern update on potential sale of Saints, Pelicans\n\nGayle Benson delivers bad news for Saints fans on general manager Mickey Loomis",

    "fullText": "The playoffs have finally arrived, and we’re locked and loaded with six matchups spanning Saturday through Monday.\n\nHeadlined by the Houston Texans spoiling the party in Steeltown, here are my favorite moneyline NFL picks for every game during Wild Card Weekend.\n\nAlthough Carolina upset Los Angeles 31–28 in Week 13, an uncharacteristic game from Matthew Stafford saw the Rams’ gunslinger turn the ball over three times, including the Panthers offense going a ridiculous 3-for-3 on fourth down.\n\nThe Rams’ scoring unit remains elite across all key metrics, finishing the year first in points per game (30.5), and Sean McVay won’t allow a repeat stumble at Bank of America Stadium.\n\nRead our full Rams vs. Panthers predictions.\n\nIt’s hard to overlook Jordan Love’s playoff experience compared with Caleb Williams.\n\nIf it weren’t for Chicago’s miraculous Week 16 comeback over Green Bay, the Packers would be slight favorites — but I’ll take the Packers, who remain stronger on defense despite injuries.\n\nChicago’s stock is at an all-time high right now, making this a perfect time to push back against the public.\n\nRead our full Packers vs. Bears predictions.\n\nGet ready for a battle between the No. 1 rushing offense and the No. 1 rushing defense.\n\nWhile it’s hard to ignore Josh Allen’s mastery under center, Jacksonville has won nine of its last 10 games, and Liam Coen has Trevor Lawrence playing the best football of his career.\n\nWith Buffalo remaining banged up on D, I’ll side with the home team to open the Sunday slate.\n\nSan Francisco has been an incredible story, and Kyle Shanahan deserves a ton of credit for getting this injury-riddled roster to the postseason... but last week’s loss to Seattle hurt in more ways than one.\n\nNot only did that home loss to Seattle cost them the No. 1 seed in the NFC, but starting linebacker Dee Winters is now listed as questionable after leaving the game with an ankle injury, while Tatum Bethune is done for the rest of the season (groin).\n\nAlready without All-Pro stars Fred Warner and Nick Bosa, a fully healthy Eagles team will send the 49ers packing on Saturday.\n\nConsidering the state of the Chargers’ offensive line, this isn’t a team that can afford to play from behind in Foxborough.\n\nAs good as the Chargers’ defense has been this season, Drake Maye is going to move the ball at some point, and the Patriots faithful will be rearing to go for their first home playoff game since 2019.\n\nBank on Justin Herbert remaining winless in the postseason.\n\nWhile Houston enters the postseason on the back of nine straight wins, the Steelers have essentially backed their way into the playoffs, barely squeaking by in Week 18 following a missed field goal at the buzzer by Baltimore kicker Tyler Loop.\n\nPittsburgh’s sluggish offense remains a tough watch, and the Houston Texans’ vaunted pass rush will make life miserable for Aaron Rodgers.\n\nMike Tomlin has lost six straight playoff games dating back a decade, and another quick exit is in store on Monday.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "description": "NFL analyst Phoebe Schecter gives her predictions as this season's play-offs begin with Wildcard Weekend.",
    "fullText": "This season's NFL play-offs begin at the weekend and here BBC columnist Phoebe Schecter gives her predictions for the six games on Wildcard Weekend.\n\nAll kick-off times GMT, Conference seed in brackets\n\nLos Angeles Rams (5) @ Carolina Panthers (4) - 21:30\n\nThis is a rematch from week 13, but I don't think it's fair to look at that 31-28 win for the Panthers. They managed to stay alive in the play-off hunt but their defence has kind of been the reason they've stayed in most of their games, rather than their quarterback Bryce Young.\n\nThe Rams are one of the Super Bowl favourites and I think their defence is going to be the final nail in the coffin for Carolina.\n\nMatt Stafford is one of the leading MVP contenders and Puka Nacua leads the league for receptions. He's just so physical in taking contested catches. His one-handed catches are incredible.\n\nThe Rams have struggled in the red zone in recent weeks without Davante Adams but he's set to come back so, for me, it's a clear Rams win.\n\nGreen Bay Packers (7) @ Chicago Bears (2) - 01:00 Sun\n\nThis is going to be awesome. They're divisional rivals and it's the NFL's oldest rivalry, so there's so much familiarity. That's what makes it so exciting.\n\nThey've played each other twice in the last five weeks and they're 1-1. The Packers almost beat the Bears in week 16, and that was after Micah Parsons' injury and being without Jordan Love for most of the game (concussion).\n\nCaleb Williams is doing such a great job with his game management, his athleticism, the way the ball just jumps out of his hand, and his receivers are coming together, so I have the Bears on this one.\n\nThey have had the most fourth-quarter comebacks in a season (six) and their defence leads the league with 33 takeaways. They'll probably need to get a couple more against Jordan Love to really seal the deal.\n\nLive text commentary on all play-off games on the BBC Sport website and app, plus live radio commentary on selected games on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds. The Whole 10 Yards, BBC Sport's weekly NFL programme, will also follow the road to Super Bowl 60\n\nBuffalo Bills (6) @ Jacksonville Jaguars (3) - 18:00\n\nWith Kansas City, Cincinnati and Baltimore not in the play-offs, this is the clearest route to the Super Bowl the Bills have had, but this is a scary Jags team.\n\nThey've won their last eight, so they're the team that has momentum. They're having fun out there, and we've never seen this version of Trevor Lawrence before, the way he's finishing in the red zone. He looks so confident.\n\nThe Jags have been clicking on all three phases since their bye week. They brought in Jakobi Myers and the Bills have to stop Travis Etienne running all over them.\n\nBut I still have so much faith in Josh Allen. We've seen it so many times, where he comes to life in the fourth quarter, and it's hard to bet against him. So I'm going for my Bills, especially because I'll be working at the game – and I can't stand the thought of them losing!\n\nSan Francisco 49ers (6) @ Philadelphia Eagles (3) - 21:30\n\nGiven their injuries, coach Kyle Shanahan has been incredible to get the 49ers where they are. They have done a great job of staying afloat with their defence, but I just don't know how sustainable it is.\n\nHaving slipped from potentially the top seed to the sixth, Shanahan's been like 'we've just got to do it the hard way'. This must mean so much to them because of the 2023 NFC Championship game in Philly, when Brock Purdy got injured and Christian McCaffrey had to play quarterback.\n\nI don't think the Eagles are going to do anything fancy. They're going to run the ball, get the play-action to throw outside to their receivers and then play great defence.\n\nIt's not cute, it's not exciting, but they just know how to win. I have a lot of faith in Jalen Hurts and their defence, so I'm going Eagles.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (7) @ New England Patriots (2) - 01:00 Mon\n\nPlaying at New England is tough in the cold and I think that makes a big difference. I don't know how much further the Patriots will go, but I think they'll win this.\n\nJustin Herbert's been hit so many times. The Chargers' offensive line has just not been able to protect him. Like the Bills, their receivers haven't been able to get separation. It's like Herbert's the magic man again, whereas at least the Patriots have some receivers, and Drake Maye has been phenomenal.\n\nI think he's earned the MVP because it's a great story. He's with a franchise that's not been itself since Tom Brady left and it's unbelievable what he's done in his second year.\n\nYou can only say their schedule has been easy so many times. You still have to beat the teams in front of you, and he's been decisive, he's stepping up in the pocket and the way he throws the ball is beautiful.\n\nWhy the NFL play-offs are the 'most unusual' in years\n\nHouston Texans (5) @ Pittsburgh Steelers (4) - 01:00 Tue\n\nThe Steelers' win on Sunday was wild, but I think we have the same conversation around them every year. Mike Tomlin's done a great job, they've got a winning record again and got to the play-offs, but for so long it's not been more than that.\n\nI'm going for the Texans because of their defence, it's just ferocious. Danielle Hunter has 15 sacks, Will Anderson is second in the NFL with a career-high 85 QB pressures, and they have four players with four interceptions. That's a crazy stat - which of their defensive backs do you throw towards?\n\nAaron Rodgers is doing tons trying to get the Steelers' offence on the same page but they're still having miscues. DK Metcalf is back from suspension but I just don't see them having enough firepower to compete with this defence.\n\nIt's the main reason the Texans could make it deep into the play-offs. They can cause a lot of trouble for a lot of people.\n\nPhoebe Schecter was speaking to BBC Sport's Ben Collins.\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Welcome back to the playoffs, New England Patriots.\n\nThe last time we saw the Patriot Way grace us this deep into January, New England got drilled in Buffalo with Mac Jones leading the way at quarterback in the 2021 season. New England's last postseason home game happened to be the last time we saw Tom Brady in a Patriots uniform, suffering an upset loss to Mike Vrabel and the Tennessee Titans in the 2019 season’s playoffs.\n\nSpeaking of Vrabel, he's back, this time in familiar digs as New England's head coach. But all eyes will be mainly focused on his quarterback, Drake Maye, who is in a tight MVP race with the Los Angeles Rams' Matthew Stafford.\n\nThe Chargers and Patriots didn’t play each other this season. The two teams matched up late in 2024 with Los Angeles winning decisively in New England, 40-7. Maye passed for only 117 yards, his worst game as a full-time starter during his rookie season.\n\nOn the other side, Justin Herbert posted the kind of performance the Chargers will need from him Sunday night. He threw for 281 yards and three touchdowns, two of those scoring passes going to Ladd McConkey, who finished with 94 yards. J.K. Dobbins (now with the Broncos) rushed for 76 yards.\n\nThe Patriots have no major injuries to deal with going into Sunday. But five players missed practice this week due to illness and the team will hope more don’t come down with a bug leading up to kickoff. For the Chargers, starting running back Omarion Hampton — the team’s second-leading rusher — hasn’t practiced all week due to an ankle issue that sidelined him for eight games this season. Edge rusher Bud Dupree has also missed practice.\n\nIt’s Michigan vs. Ohio State on the opposing sidelines.\n\nVrabel is a leading candidate for Coach of the Year honors after turning New England around from a 4-13 slog in 2024 to a 13-4 resurgence this season. He has a 3-5 playoff record, which includes the Tennessee Titans’ run to the AFC championship game in the 2019 season. Harbaugh boasts a 5-4 mark, which includes three consecutive NFC championship games with the San Francisco 49ers and an appearance in Super Bowl XLVII. Yet the Chargers lost in last season’s wild-card round, 32-12, to the Houston Texans.\n\nAs Herbert goes, so do the Chargers. Last season, he threw four interceptions in Los Angeles’ playoff defeat. This season, when he didn’t play well, the Chargers typically couldn’t overcome those poor performances. (The lone exception was Week 14’s 22-19 overtime win over the Philadelphia Eagles, in which Herbert threw for only 139 yards.) However, the Patriots may provide an ideal matchup for Herbert to shine. New England allowed 4,459 passing yards this season and 8.9 yards per throw, both worst in the AFC. And only the Bengals gave up more TD passes (36) this season than the Patriots’ 31 among conference teams.\n\nMaye has been viewed as an MVP candidate throughout the season. But he’ll face the NFL’s fourth-best pass defense (3,314 yards allowed) in the Chargers. Only two other teams had more interceptions than the 19 Los Angeles grabbed this season. So the Patriots may have to run the ball to win. That could suit them well, as they compiled the third-most rushing yards in the AFC. TreVeyon Henderson led the team with 911 yards and nine TDs. He ran for a season-high 148 yards and two scores in Week 15 versus the Bills.\n\nNew England was actually better on the road (8-0) this season than at home (6-3). But temperatures in Foxborough, Massachusetts, are expected to be in the mid-30s by Sunday’s 8 p.m. ET kickoff, which isn’t ideal for a team coming from Los Angeles.\n\nThe conditions could make it difficult for both quarterbacks, which puts an emphasis on the running game. Maye should get more help in that regard than Herbert. The Patriots’ ability to control the line of scrimmage on offense with two talented running backs capable of rushing for 100 yards could be the difference.",

    "fullText": "Fernando Mendoza vs. Dante Moore: The key stats you need to know in 2026 NFL Draft debate originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFernando Mendoza and Dante Moore didn't have much of a Big Ten quarterback duel when Indiana beat Oregon in the college football regular season. But now that both QBs have led their teams to playoff semifinals, a lot more is at stake.\n\nWhen Mendoza's Hoosiers have their rematch with Moore's Ducks in Friday's Peach Bowl in Atlanta, there will be a trip to the national championship game at stake. The outcome and the related performances will also help determine which QB goes to the top of the draft class in 2026.\n\nWith the Las Vegas Raiders and New York Jets having the No. 1 and No. 2 overall picks and badly needing quarterbacks, the franchises will spend a lot of time on vetting Mendoza vs. Moore.\n\nBetween arm strength, accuracy, pocket presence and intangibles, there's a lot to like about Mendoza (6-5, 225), the Heisman Trophy winner, and Moore, a well-rounded talent. But their head-to-head stats will no doubt have some influence on who ends up coming off the board first.\n\nHere's looking at their seasons before playing again, including what happened in the previous matchup on Oct. 11:\n\nNFL MOCK DRAFT: Where Fernando Mendoza and Dante Moore land in latest projections\n\nMoore had more volume, but in terms of efficiency and every other category, Mendoza stood out as the worthy Heisman winner, with Vanderbilt's Diego Pavia and Ohio State's Julian Sayin making the cut over Moore as finalists. Neither Mendoza nor Moore would be considered dual threats with their running, but they have enough wheels to extend pass plays and rush for key yardage in big moments.\n\nHere are the numbers both QBs put when facing each other's tough defenses back on Oct. 11, played at Oregon's Autzen Stadium:\n\nThat wasn't the best showcase game for either QB, given the respective degrees of difficulty. Mendoza did outplay Moore. Expect both QBs to perform much better as more seasoned and playoff-winning passers almost three months later.\n\nMORE: Five players to watch in the Indiana vs. Oregon CPF semifinal\n\nThe Raiders already are on the clock for April 23 in Pittsburgh. Given the influence of former Big Ten passer Tom Brady as part-owner, he has a tough decision to make for the new face of the franchise. Mendoza, given his gritty profile and clutch confidence, would seem to fit better as the Raiders' savior.\n\nMoore, meanwhile, might be the right QB on whom the Jets can take a shot with his mental and physical attributes to deliver for Aaron Glenn and Tanner Engstrand, who coached Jared Goff in Detroit. Another QB such as Alabama's Ty Simpson could emerge in the conversation, but for now, Mendoza is the man.\n\nThere's a long way to go in the draft process, however, including the Combine and pro days. Mendoza vs. Moore started off mild, but it's become red-hot on the biggest stages.\n\nMORE 2026 COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF NEWS:\n\nExpert picks for Indiana vs. Oregon CFP semifinal\n\nRanking four teams remaining in College Football Playoff\n\nPredictions for Ole Miss vs. Miami CFP semifinal",

    "description": "Nearly four years after the lawsuit was first filed, a key threshold question is moving toward a final answer.",
    "fullText": "Nearly four years after the lawsuit was first filed, a key threshold question is moving toward a final answer.\n\nThe NFL has filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court as to the question of whether the civil action filed in February 2022 by former Dolphins coach (and current Vikings defensive coordinator) Brian Flores against the NFL, the Dolphins, the Giants, the Broncos, and the Texans will be resolved in court, or in arbitration.\n\nThe specific legal question presented to the Supreme Court is this: \"Whether an arbitration agreement governing disputes in a professional sports league is categorically unenforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act because it designates the league commissioner as the default arbitrator and permits the commissioner to develop arbitral procedures.\"\n\nThe NFL has wisely narrowed the question, given that the reasoning (if applied throughout corporate America) would empower other companies to attempt to rig the in-house arbitration process by putting employment disputes in the hands of the CEO. Still, the league's position is clear — it wants the Commissioner to retain power over disputes involving the NFL and the various teams that have hired and that handsomely compensate the Commissioner.\n\nThe 25-page document is the first step in an effort to persuade the Supreme Court to take up the case. Of the many petitions it receives each year, few are accepted.\n\nMore time will pass as the Supreme Court considers whether to take the case. Even more time will pass if the Supreme Court grants the petition.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit invalidated the NFL's arbitration provision, concluding that the procedure lacks independence. (And it does.) The Supreme Court, if it takes the case, will decide once and for all whether it's legitimate for the NFL (and any sports league) to put its Commissioner in charge of claims made against the NFL.\n\nIt's fundamentally unfair to delegate those powers to someone whose connection to one side of a legal fight is so obvious. Frankly, no Commissioner should want to be expected to set aside their clear self-interests in an effort to dispense justice in an objective way.\n\nBut this has been the league's practice, for years. It desperately wants to run its own business. It desperately hopes to hold the gavel when it comes to deciding whether the legal claims against it are valid.\n\nIt's a bad way to do business. It's now for the Supreme Court to decide whether it's a good way, or a bad way, to apply the laws of the United States.",

    "fullText": "The President of the United States is officially \"warning\" all 32 teams across the National Football League.\n\nPresident Trump, 79, is not happy with the Baltimore Ravens firing John Harbaugh. He's warning both the Ravens - and the rest of the league - that they will be making a big mistake if they don't hire him. President Trump is a major fan of the Super Bowl-winning head coach.\n\nWhile some have told political figures to stay out of sports, President Trump is very much making his presence felt. The President of the United States is expected to pressure NFL teams into hiring John Harbaugh. President Trump has a close relationship with many prominent NFL owners.\n\nPresident Trump issued his official \"warning\" to the 32 NFL franchises on social media this week, following Harbaugh's firing.\n\n\"HIRE JOHN HARBAUGH, FAST,\" Trump warned. \"HE AND HIS BROTHER, ARE TOTAL WINNERS!!!\"\n\nJohn Harbaugh has previously shown love for President Trump and the White House.\n\nHarbaugh, who led the Ravens to a Super Bowl win in 2013, visited the White House over the summer.\n\n\"How you framed that question — I would have framed that question like: 'You got a chance to go visit with the president, man. What was that experience like?'\" Harbaugh said in response to a reporter asking him about visiting with President Trump, who had been critical of Baltimore.\n\n\"It was amazing. It was awesome. And I promise you I root for our president. I want our president to be successful just like I want my quarterback to be successful and I want my team to be successful, and it was an amazing experience.\"\n\nHis brother, Jim Harbaugh, has met more U.S. Presidents.\n\n\"He's got seven, I got four. I had a chance to meet President Obama twice — incredible experience. Had a chance to meet President Biden when he was vice president in Iraq, and spent a lot of time with him in Iraq,\" he said. \"Jim got invited also to the White House to meet President Reagan because he was a Heisman Trophy candidate. We got to go as a family, so I met President Reagan — have a picture in my office of that.\"",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots have smashed preseason expectations in head coach Mike Vrabel’s first year.\n\nThey secured the AFC’s No. 2 seed and will host the Los Angeles Chargers at Gillette Stadium in the Wildcard round on Sunday.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it will be second-year quarterback Drake Maye’s NFL postseason debut. But it will be far from Maye’s first truly meaningful game.\n\nIn 2022, the then-20-year-old quarterback squared off with the college football juggernauts that are the Clemson Tigers in the ACC Conference Championship game.\n\nIt was Maye’s sophomore year at the University of North Carolina, and he had brought the Tar Heels to a 9-3 record and a top-25 ranking.\n\nMaye was asked during his Wednesday afternoon press conference what he learned from that experience.\n\n“Maybe a little bit,” Maye said when asked if that college experience correlates to his NFL playoff debut. “Getting back to trying to play for championships… I think it’s a little bit different in the NFL.\n\n“Just the mentality of ‘win or go home’ or ‘win and advance,’ and I think that’s the biggest thing that’s different. In the ACC Championship, you go to a bowl game. Here it’s (win) now, or you’re going home.”\n\nMaye was unable to win the conference championship in 2022, and, as he alluded to, earned a second chance in a game against Bo Nix’s 15th-ranked Oregon Ducks.\n\nMaye threw for 206 yards and three touchdowns in the 2022 Holiday Bowl. He led his team to a 24-10 fourth-quarter lead and added three points on his final drive of the game.\n\nThe defense was unable to stop the Ducks’ two-minute drill as Nix threw the game-winning touchdown with 19 seconds on the clock and beat the Tar Heels 28-27.\n\nDrake Maye Silences Emerging Narrative About Patriots-Chargers Matchup",

    "fullText": "After 18 seasons, the Baltimore Ravens decided to move on from future Hall of Fame coach John Harbaugh, who won 180 games and a Super Bowl. He’s undoubtedly the best head coaching candidate available in a league that now has seven vacancies, including the Ravens.\n\nThe Ravens fired Harbaugh so they could hire someone else. Now, another NFL team is reportedly weighing the decision to fire its coach and hire Harbaugh. But which team it is remains unclear.\n\nAccording to Harbaugh’s agent Bryan Harlan, Harbaugh’s availability has already prompted seven calls from NFL teams that have interest in the former Ravens coach. Yet again, only seven teams have vacancies, and the Ravens obviously aren’t calling to say they want him back now.\n\nThis means there’s another team that has yet to move on their head coach, who is currently pondering a switcheroo. That is, if Harbaugh’s agent is telling the truth.\n\nOf course, it’s his job to drive up the price for his client and make it seem like he’s the best thing since sliced bread. Still, it’s not that hard to believe that a team could be interested in upgrading to Harbaugh, who ranks 14th on the NFL’s all-time coaching wins list.\n\nThere’s still speculation that the Pittsburgh Steelers and Mike Tomlin could be headed for a split. How fun would it be for Harbaugh to head to one of the Ravens’ biggest rivals? After all, he knows this division like the back of his hand.\n\nIf not the Steelers, what about a team like the New York Jets? They can’t be too sold on Aaron Glenn after a 3-14 season. Possibly even the Miami Dolphins after Mike McDaniel’s poor start to the 2025 NFL campaign. Though, since McDaniel’s been involved in the GM hiring process, that would be an awkward split.\n\nWe don’t imagine the Indianapolis Colts are thinking about a coaching change after Shane Steichen proved he could lead a dominant effort with improved QB play, even if it was just for a stretch of the season. Yet, anything’s possible.\n\nWould the Washington Commanders consider a change after the bottom fell out on Dan Quinn’s team after they lost eight games in a row? A year after reaching the NFC Conference Championship, we doubt Quinn’s job is in danger this offseason.\n\nThat leaves the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who have been pretty silent on the future of Todd Bowles, though he believes he deserves a shot at another season. After seeing the offense and defense regress and failing to take control of a division that was clearly up for grabs, perhaps the Buccaneers are a team that’s silently pondering a change.\n\nIn any event, this unknown team is operating in the shadows. But quietly, they’re likely hoping Harbaugh says yes to them before moving on from the coach they’re already committed to.\n\nWith Harbaugh shaking things up, could there soon be eight NFL head coaching vacancies, leaving a quarter of the jobs up for grabs? Would that then spur someone like Bill Belichick’s interest?\n\nBill Belichick Addresses Rumored Interest in NFL Head Coaching Vacancies\n\nNY Giants Must Stop Flirting With Kevin Stefanski, Hire John Harbaugh Right Now\n\nNew York Giants Spending Lots of Time With Top Coaching Candidate",

By ground, No. 38 broke off 131 rushing yards and a pair of visits to the end zone. By air, he added 22 receiving yards and another score on a sluggo route.\n\nLongs of 56 and 35 yards were among them for Stevenson. The starting back would be the lone player around the league to log three touchdowns from scrimmage in Week 18. He finished with 104 rushing yards over expectation, per Next Gen Stats, and was charted by Pro Football Focus for forcing four missed tackles on his handoffs.\n\nIt marks the first weekly honor for the No. 120 overall pick in the 2021 NFL draft. A former transfer from Cerritos College to the University of Oklahoma, Stevenson checks in as the first Sooners product to win AFC or NFC Offensive Player of the Week this campaign. He joins nine-time winner Adrian Peterson and four-time winner Joe Mixon in the school’s archives at running back.\n\nBetween all three phases, Stevenson is also the sixth different member of the Patriots to get such a call this season.\n\nThe conference’s No. 2 seed was previously represented by kickoff returner Antonio Gibson in Week 2, punt returner Marcus Jones in Week 4, outside linebacker K’Lavon Chaisson in Week 7, kicker Andy Borregales in Week 12 and quarterback Drake Maye in Week 13.\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers visit head coach Mike Vrabel’s group in Foxborough on Sunday.

    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs used significant draft picks on wide receivers in recent years but need to invest in the position during the 2026 NFL draft. With Marquise Brown, Travis Kelce, JuJu Smith-Schuster and Tyquan Thornton all entering free agency, the team desperately needs another quality pass catcher capable of elevating the offense.\n\nGeorgia State Panthers wide receiver Ted Hurst is a more well-rounded receiver than Thornton and more explosive than Smith-Schuster. His 6’3”, 195 lbs. frame also separates him from existing members of the Chiefs wide receiver room. Hurst projects as a top 100 selection who should grow into a contributor by the mid-point of his rookie season.\n\nHurst explodes off the line of scrimmage and displays the agile footwork to work across the faces of cornerbacks during his release. He lacks elite speed but uses his initial burst to overtake and stack cornerbacks. While Hurst’s speed isn’t special, he succeeded in stretching the field and generating chunk gains with his long strides at Georgia State.\n\nGeorgia State WR Ted Hurst is my #1 offensive prospect from the G5. \n\n- 6’3/195 \n- goal line fade machine\n- crisp route runner with sudden deceleration\n- elusive after the catch (17 mtkl forced this year)\n- burst to stack press-man\n- good not great top gear\n- cuts routes off vs.… pic.twitter.com/LvUgymsCJO\n\n— James Foster (@NoFlagsFilm) November 15, 2025\n\nDespite being a taller receiver, Hurst sinks his hips well at the top of the route stem and executes effective cuts and route fakes. His route definition occasionally suffers on digs, but he generates natural separation on curls and comebacks.\n\nHurst regularly finds open space against zone coverage and runs his routes to precise depths to move the chains. His work against press coverage needs to improve. The Georgia native is lean and lacks the play strength to power through jams at the line of scrimmage. This makes it easier for cornerbacks to re-route him and impact the timing of the offense’s plays.\n\nHurst caught 61.1% of his contested targets over the past two years. He isn’t a bully at the catch point but tracks the ball well and makes great adjustments to secure receptions through contact. Hurst drops easier receptions due to lapses of concentration, but he dials in for contested opportunities.\n\nHurst lacks the mass and power to break tackles after the catch, but his long strides and agility make him a threat to find open space and gash defenses. He uses jump cuts and his springy footwork to evade defenders while probing for room to run.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: 2026 NFL draft scouting report: Georgia State Panthers WR Ted Hurst",

He guided the Crimson Tide to their first College Football Playoff victory since 2021 with a win over Oklahoma, though his postseason run ended on a sour note after he struggled and exited with an injury in Alabama’s quarterfinal loss.\n\nTy Simpson was super active pre-snap v. LSU. His pre-snap recognition was a consistent strength.\n\nSenses the impending blitz here. As soon as he sees the nickel coming, he knows the safety spacing is too wide to account for the sit route inside the slot fade. Places it perfectly. pic.twitter.com/7OAkE2g4QX\n\n— Ian Cummings (@IC_Draft) November 11, 2025\n\nDespite that setback, Simpson’s draft stock remains strong. ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. currently ranks Simpson as the No. 3 quarterback in the incoming class, slotting him behind Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza and Oregon’s Dante Moore — both of whom are competing in the College Football Playoff semifinals and have yet to officially declare.\n\nGiven Pittsburgh’s likely draft position, the Steelers are not expected to be realistic contenders for Mendoza or Moore, making Simpson an especially compelling name to watch as draft season approaches. His blend of production, poise, and experience against elite competition has already sparked conversation around Pittsburgh as the organization evaluates succession plans behind Rodgers. There are, however, concerns about his lack of experience and durability.\n\nThe timing only adds to the intrigue. The 2026 NFL Draft will be held in Pittsburgh, placing the franchise firmly in the national spotlight as it navigates one of the most consequential roster decisions of the coming era.\n\nWhether Simpson ultimately becomes the next quarterback to don black and gold remains to be seen. But as the offseason begins to take shape, his declaration ensures the Steelers — and their fans — will be paying close attention.",

    "fullText": "The NFL Playoffs have been ripe with underdog winners in recent years. Over the last five postseasons, playoff pups cover the spread at a 60% clip.\n\nThe Wild Card Round used to be one of the best slates to take the points. However, the “Super” Wild Card Weekend – with six games on the board instead of four - has been “Super Mild” in terms of underdog success.\n\nIn the seven playoffs before stretching the field to 14 teams, Wild Card dogs were 19-8-1 ATS – a 70% ATS windfall. Since expanding the bracket, pups have barely barked at 16-14 ATS over the last five postseasons.\n\nWith the field a little “watered down,” you can’t just blindly bag up all the underdogs and hope for the best. You must be more selective when it comes to taking the points with your NFL Wild Card picks and predictions.\n\nHere are my best underdog NFL picks for this year’s “Super” Wild Card Weekend.\n\nRegular season: 31-21-2 ATS (+6.73 units)\n\nBest bet: Chicago Bears +1.5\n(-120 at Caesars Sportsbook)\n\nThe Chicago Bears backed into the postseason on a two-game slide but were playing their best football down the stretch. The offense, more specifically, has looked great.\n\nThis is a Top-5 attack in terms of EPA per play since Week 12, with a two-headed monster forming at running back (D’Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai) and really giving Ben Johnson’s playbook dimension.\n\nChicago grinded for 99 yards or more on the ground in the six games before Week 18’s flop against the Lions, topping 130 rushing yards in four of those games, including 138 and 150 yards in two matchups with the Green Bay Packers.\n\nThe Packers’ once-mighty defense has been decimated by injuries, most notably along the defensive line. Green Bay has been bullied in the trenches, watching foes roll for a 48% success rate per handoff since Week 12 (31st). It’ll get pushed around by Chicago’s elite offensive line, which could be the best in the NFC.\n\nWinning the \"turf war\" makes life easier for everyone in Chitown.\n\nThose ground gains set up for shorter third downs, activate Johnson’s vaunted play-action schemes, make the Packers’ soft secondary vulnerable to random deep shots, and chew up possession, which then boosts the Bears defense and forces Green Bay to be one-dimensional with limited offensive touches.\n\nBest bet: Pittsburgh Steelers +3.5\n(-110 at BetRivers)\n\nRegardless of how they got there, the Pittsburgh Steelers are in the playoffs.\n\nThe Steelers are hosting a Houston Texans team in one of the toughest venues in all of sports. Acrisure Stadium will undoubtedly be loud and cold, with temperatures that “feel like” sub-freezing on Monday night.\n\nThe Texans are all about that defense, entering the postseason with the top-ranked stop unit in the land. But to cover the spread, you need to put some points on the board. That’s been challenging for C.J. Stroud & Co. – at least when venturing into the great outdoors.\n\nHouston averages less than 22 points per game in open-air venues and only 19.8 per road game – a 7.5-point slide compared to its production at home. Stroud is notoriously an “indoor cat,\" with his career passer rating, completion percentage, and yards per attempt all taking a nosedive outside.\n\nThe Texans’ offensive line is still an area of concern. While Houston has better protected Stroud this season, this group is still 21st in pass block win rate at ESPN, 22nd in pass block rating at PFF, and has allowed Stroud to feel pressure on almost 22% of dropbacks with the 12th most QB hurries allowed.\n\nPittsburgh’s bread and butter has always been chaos. That comes in the form of a pass rush that brings the blitz at the fourth-highest rate and sits Top 10 in both QB hits and sacks.\n\nStroud’s passing performances take a knock versus blitz-heavy schemes, with less time for deeper plays to develop. Houston went just 4-4 ATS as a visitor and, of course, you can't discount Mike Tomlin as a home underdog: 23-9-3 ATS since 2007 (70%).\n\nMy NFL Underdogs column is 31-21-2 ATS this season for +6.73 units.\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.
