Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJordon Hudson took Bill Belichick’s Pro Football Hall of Fame snub personal by planning a celebration of her own.\n\nAccording to a report from People, Belichick's girlfriend is organizing a “huge bash” for the legendary coach on Aug. 8 — the same day the Pro Football Hall of Fame will induct its Class of 2026 in Canton, Ohio.\n\nThe party is expected to take place just weeks before Belichick begins his second season as the head coach at North Carolina. The event is reportedly intended as a show of support after Belichick fell one vote short of first-ballot induction, receiving 39 of the 40 votes required for election.\n\nHudson is expected to invite several prominent figures closely tied to Belichick’s career, including Tom Brady, Jimmy Johnson and Bill Parcells. Many of whom would have otherwise attended the ceremony in Canton. An anonymous source told People the purpose of the bash is “to celebrate alongside all of his people.”\n\nBelichick’s omission sparked widespread reaction across the NFL world, with reports suggesting internal politics among voters may have played a role.\n\nIn response to the backlash, the Hall of Fame released a statement affirming the integrity of its selection process and noting that any violations of voting bylaws could result in disciplinary action.\n\nBelichick, who owns eight Super Bowl rings — six as a head coach — and a 302-165 career record, has not publicly addressed the snub. His focus remains on his next chapter in college football, but Hudson ensures his legacy is celebrated anyway.\n\nSNL pokes fun at Michael Irvin's amped up Miami Hurricanes fandom\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nJimmy Kimmel roasts Bill Belichick’s girlfriend over Hall of Fame debate\n\nGoogle changes Curt Cignetti search results following Indiana’s CFP title win\n\nEx-Indiana QB fires back after portrayal in CBS 60 Minutes interview",

    "fullText": "Bengals, Cowboys, Seahawks, 49ers dubbed top landing spots for former $22 million Pro Bowler defender originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals, Dallas Cowboys, Seattle Seahawks, and San Francisco 49ers could target a former Pro Bowl edge rusher this offseason to upgrade their defenses.\n\nCBS Sports' Zach Pereles believes Jadeveon Clowney could have a decent market in free agency, with the Bengals, Cowboys, Seahawks, and 49ers as potential suitors.\n\nPereles adds his prediction of Clowney leaving Dallas to sign with Cincinnati:\n\n\"Even at 32, Clowney showed he can get after the passer and stop the run at a high level. The Bengals very much need both.\"\n\nClowney played in 13 games and started six for the Cowboys in 2025, posting 8.5 sacks and 40 quarterback pressures, proving that he can still be a valuable part of a pass-rushing rotation.\n\nDallas should look to retain Clowney, but if he does leave, any contender will be interested in the former No. 1 pick.\n\nCincinnati and San Francisco could use more pass-rushing help, especially the Bengals if they lose Trey Hendrickson. Clowney would step in as an immediate starter for the Bengals and provide solid production as a complementary pass rusher.\n\nThe 49ers could also use Clowney to pair with Nick Bosa, who will return in 2026 after playing just three games in 2025 due to a torn ACL. An edge rusher duo of Bosa and Clowney would be electric and revive a San Francisco pass rush that ranked last in the NFL in sacks this year.\n\nThough they already have a stacked defense, don't rule out a reunion between Clowney and the Seahawks.

    "description": "The Cleveland Browns need to add to their tight end room with Justin Joly an option in the 2026 NFL draft",
    "fullText": "How is the tight end situation with the Cleveland Browns? Will quality backups be needed? Will the team look to NFL free agency, the NFL draft, or both to help the room?\n\nTight end Justin Joly of North Carolina State got an invite from the Senior Bowl and was thrilled that he was considered one of the best at his position. He also wanted to prove that he belonged and would make a great addition to any roster.\n\nJoly grew up in New Rochelle, New York, and went to UConn for two years, where he led the team in receptions. He entered the final week of the regular season ranked third in FBS in both categories for tight ends.\n\nAfter going 3-9-0 in 2023, he then entered the portal and took the offer from North Carolina State.\n\nMore than blessed to be on this earth for 18 years\n\n— Justin Joly (@jjoly_17) July 9, 2022\n\nNC State finished its 2024 season with a 9-4-0 record and one game out of first place in the conference with a 6-2-0 mark. But they couldn’t beat Notre Dame and Duke in critical conference play. However, they did thump their rival, North Carolina, 39-20.\n\nJolly was named First Team All-ACC after his senior season.\n\nDawgs by Nature staff writer Barry Shuck was at the Senior Bowl this week. He interviewed Joly during a practice session.\n\n————————————————————————————————————————————\n\nShuck: You were the leading receiver at UConn, yet you left. What was the issue?\n\nJoly: Coming out of high school, I didn’t have many offers. UConn was the best choice. After leading my team in catches, I wanted bigger opportunities and didn’t see them with UConn playing schools like Ball State, Fresno State, and Sacred Heart. I wanted bigger games with a Power-5 school. Then we only won three games, so I talked to my family and decided that, as much as I enjoyed my time at UConn and loved the coaching staff, I entered the portal. I improved my blocking and route running while at UConn. NC State, Tennessee, and Houston offered.\n\nShuck: You grew up in New York State, so UConn was close to home. Did that enter into your decision to end up in the State of North Carolina, where the weather and culture are so much different?\n\nJoly: Honestly, it really didn’t matter to me. I just want to play good football. I know I’m far away from home, and my mom didn’t like that much. It’s a great place where I’m at. The culture and fanbase at NC State are great, and my coaches have a lot of respect for me and are really hyped for the season.\n\nShuck: How do you describe your game?\n\nJoly: I am resilient and will fight with my brothers. I am the person who is giving 100%, 100% of the time. Just watch what you did and correct, and do whatever you got to do.\n\nShuck: What do you need to improve?\n\nJoly: A little bit of everything. There’s nothing to my game, I think is perfect, nor will ever be. I would say route running, hands, and work more on blocking.  I’m a true competitor and look for every edge I can get.\n\nJoly: My ability after the catch with good hands, blocking downfield. I am a great downfield blocker. I am good at reading and understanding defenses. And if the offense needs to play fast, I’m there for it.\n\nShuck: What do you learn most after a loss?\n\nJoly: They beat us, and we beat ourselves. So, really, it was 22 versus zero. It’s hard because I hate losing. Always props to the other team, but find the issues and make corrections. Then work at it, bring the pressure, and prep for it. You have to keep your head up and maintain the good energy that we have within the facility.\n\nShuck: NFL teams like physical tools, and you are a former basketball player. What skills in that sport have helped you in football?\n\nJoly: Playing a position that requires catching passes means being able to jump, and a lot of passes aren’t near where I need the ball to be, so you have to adjust and go after it. I study a lot of film and want to be on the same page as my quarterback, but sometimes the pass rush changes the pattern of the ball in flight. I am a good jumper, and with my height, I feel I can get up more than any linebacker covering me. Plus, all the running in basketball.\n\nShuck: You haven’t gotten the attention and respect nationally for being such a good tight end. Do you walk around with a chip on your shoulder?\n\nJoly: Honestly, that doesn’t faze me because at the end of the day, I think my teammates know what I am capable of. And a lot of times, your job is just to block for other players to get the stats and attention. And that’s my job in that game. In the next game, I might get the most targets. I want the respect of the people in the locker room.",

    "description": "The NFL has informed its clubs about the salary cap outlook for 2026.",
    "fullText": "While the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks are preparing for their showdown in Super Bowl LX, the other 30 teams in the NFL are already in offseason mode. On Friday, the NFL shared some crucial information with all of them: the salary cap projection for the upcoming season is out.\n\nAccording to a report by NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero, the league will set its spending ceiling for 2026 in the range of $301.2 million to $305.7 million per team. For comparison, the cap was set at $279.2 million for the current season.\n\nAt between 7.9% and 9.5%, the increase from 2025 to 2026 marks the latest major jump in the cap. In the five years since taking a one-year dip due to the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic, it has grown by more than $100 million.\n\nDespite having been among the most active team in the NFL last offseason, the Patriots are again in decent shape heading into 2026.\n\nAccording to salary cap expert Miguel Benzan, who is using the middle ground of $303.45 million for his calculations, the AFC champions are currently projected to be $42.6 million under the cap with 50 players signed. This places them in the top-10 for the next league year.\n\nNew England may be less financially flexible as last spring, when the club was near the top of the table, but it still has ample resources available to maintain the quality of its roster and add outside talent. At the moment, after all, only seven of its current players are headed for unrestricted free agency, with defensive linemen Khyiris Tonga and K’Lavon Chaisson as well as safety Jaylinn Hawkins the most prominent names on the list.",

    "description": "Kansas City Chiefs fans need to check out some of the best defensive linemen from the Senior Bowl before the 2026 NFL Draft.",
    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs need to add depth, and maybe even a starter, along their defensive line in the 2026 NFL Draft. Fortunately, some of the best trench players in the class recently came together to compete in Mobile, Ala. for the Senior Bowl. Several prospects stood out as potential targets for the Chiefs.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Focus, George Karlaftis was the only Kansas City edge rusher to amass 35 or more pressures in 2025. For reference, 59 edge rushers across the entire NFL reached that threshold. Within the AFC West, a duo of Denver Broncos, three Las Vegas Raiders and three Los Angeles Chargers accomplished the feat. Only the Chiefs lagged behind.\n\nFuture Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive tackle Chris Jones helps the Chiefs keep their noses above water in the pass rush, but he offers limited value in run defense at this stage of his career. Jones turns 32 years old before the start of the 2026 season.\n\nThe Chiefs need to add immediate production on the edge while also considering the long-term future of their interior defensive line. The Senior Bowl features enough star prospects to satisfy both needs, if the Chiefs hit on their selections.\n\nWhen the 2026 Panini Senior Bowl kicks off at 1:30 p.m. CT today on NFL Network, Chiefs fans should keep an eye out for these five star defensive linemen.\n\nHeight is undersized at 6’2 3/8”, 234 lbs. with 32 3/4” arms. Those measurements didn’t stop him from dominating opposing offensive tackles during the team periods. He beat Dametrious Crownover with an outside jab into a B-gap swim and reached the quarterback in just 2.1 seconds on Wednesday. Height’s speed rush is very effective and sets up his twitchy inside counters.\n\nHeight suffered several clean losses. He struggles to win when offensive tackles get into his pads early in the play, and his limited mass makes it difficult to survive heavy punches. Height projects best as a rotational edge rusher who could develop into a full-time starter, similar to Alex Highsmith’s path on the Steelers.\n\nJacas, Kyle Louis and Zion Young stood at the pinnacle of performance throughout the Senior Bowl practices. At 6’3 1/8”, 260 lbs. with 32 3/4” arms, Jacas is a stout, sawed-off rusher capable of driving through the offensive tackle’s frame with power, winning around the corner with technical savvy or reducing inside to challenge guards.\n\nJacas won at the Senior Bowl with an outside speed rush, speed-to-power conversion, chop-rip combinations and swims through the B-gap. His explosiveness off the line of scrimmage led to several instantaneous wins.\n\nJacas fits the archetype of edge rusher Kansas City values. He entered the week with mixed grades. Now, it seems inconceivable that he goes anywhere later than the early third round.\n\nBanks missed most of his final season with injuries and started off on the wrong foot in Mobile. His first day or practice was a wash, but he dominated across the final two sessions. At 6’6”, 335 lbs. with 35” arms and 10 3/4” hands, Banks is a behemoth capable of pushing the pocket or applying clean pressure by discarding guards with his violent hands.\n\nCaleb Banks gets a win on Auburn’s Jeremiah Wright, and he’s feeling pretty good about it. #thedraftstartsinmobile #seniorbowl #nfldraft pic.twitter.com/qIbxVFIQXi\n\n— Sam Teets (@Sam_Teets33) January 29, 2026\n\nBanks displays rare foot quickness and agility early in plays, especially for a defender his size. His pad level becomes a limiting factor late in games, but the tradeoff seems worth it for teams hoping to add more muscle to their defensive front.\n\nHunter is a physical freak in his own right. He’s 6’3 1/2”, 320 lbs. with 34 1/4” arms. His rare explosiveness helps him drive vertically on pass plays, but he also possesses the quickness and lateral agility to exchange gaps or sidestep and play around blockers.\n\nLee Hunter is a top 50 player for me. 330-lb NT with heavy hands and a very quick first step for his size. Comfortably the most detailed and instinctive pass rusher in the '26 NT class pic.twitter.com/NC3o1WNdu9\n\n— James Foster (@NoFlagsFilm) December 10, 2025\n\nHunter’s stout anchor and long arms make it easy for him to stack, peek and shed blockers in the run game. Displacing him at the point of attack is a challenging task. Hunter resets the line of scrimmage by driving blockers into the backfield and finishes big plays with his closing burst.\n\nHunter’s skill set and playstyle make him the perfect complement to Chris Jones. The Texas Tech product should rank near the top of Kansas City’s draft board.\n\nYoung ranked among the top performers at the Senior Bowl. He is a dense and powerful edge rusher at 6’5 1/4”, 262 lbs. with 33 1/2” arms. Throughout the week, he displayed the power to push the pocket and soften angles before finishing his rushes with counters.\n\nThe power that Missouri’s Zion Young has shown at the Senior Bowl is terrifying. You don’t want to see him lining up across from you in a four-point stance with those bent elbows. pic.twitter.com/qCksPcbCZh\n\n— Bobby Football (@Rob__Paul) January 29, 2026\n\nYoung sent Jude Bowry tumbling in a one-on-one rep and folded J.C. Davis in one of the most dominant displays of power all week. Young primarily relies on winning through the offensive lineman’s frame or countering into or prying open the B-gap because of his lack of bend. However, his long strides help him push upfield quickly and led to some clean wins in the team periods.\n\nYoung’s arm length, play strength and anchor also make him an effective edge-setter in the run game.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs NFL Draft: Watch these 5 Senior Bowl defensive linemen",

    "description": "Mike Evans hasn’t had the first discussion with the Bucs about his future. There have been no conversations about 2026 with his agent, Deryk Gilmore, who is currently focused on clients in the NFL draft.",
    "fullText": "Mike Evans hasn’t had the first discussion with the Bucs about his future. There have been no conversations about 2026 with his agent, Deryk Gilmore, who is currently focused on clients in the NFL draft.\n\nStill, as with any pending free agent, there is going to be speculation.\n\nEvans will be 33 by the time training camp gets underway in August. He can retire, return to play for the Bucs or take his talents elsewhere.\n\nEvans is the greatest offensive player in franchise history, a certain future Pro Football Hall of Famer who tied Jerry Rice with an NFL-record 11 consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons to begin his career.\n\nHe endured six full years in Tampa Bay without so much as a whiff of the playoffs, then the Bucs won Super Bowl 55 in his first postseason.\n\nBut this season, Evans was limited to eight games by a hamstring injury and a broken clavicle. The streak died. He caught only 30 passes.\n\nEven so, Evans proved he still had plenty of football left in the tank when he returned after eight weeks to catch six passes for a season-high 132 yards, including a 45-yard reception, in a late-season loss to Atlanta.\n\nHe showed speed, quickness and agility, and brought energy to the offense.\n\nThe first question for any player when contemplating their future is whether they still can impact the game. For Evans, it’s a resounding yes.\n\nQuarterback Baker Mayfield hasn’t talked to Evans this offseason but predicted this past week he would continue playing and that it would be for the Bucs.\n\n“Mike’s too much of a competitor and cares too much about Tampa to end his career without 1,000 yards, without a division championship, without a playoff run,” Mayfield said on “The Ronde Barber Show.”\n\nNew Bucs offensive coordinator Zac Robinson said Tuesday he had not spoken to Evans but wants him back. The fact Mayfield is confident in Robinson, who was the Rams’ passing game coordinator and quarterbacks coach when he spent five weeks with LA in 2022, is a plus.\n\n“I have a ton of respect for Mike and his game throughout his career,” Robinson said. “Obviously, watching from afar, I know he’s got to work through a lot of things, but I would obviously love an opportunity to work with Mike.”\n\nTony Pauline of “Essentially Sports” said this week that those he’d spoken to believe there’s a less than 50-50 chance Evans would want to return to the Bucs in 2026. He suggested Evans would prefer to go to a team that has a better chance of winning a Super Bowl.\n\nBut it may be best to hear it from Evans’ own mouth.\n\nHe covered many of the same subjects in an interview with the Tampa Bay Times prior to a preseason game in Pittsburgh in August. At the time, Evans knew he was nearing the end of his career.\n\n“This game is going to be gone, and I ain’t going to be able to do this anymore,” he said. “I know I’m not playing more than five years. Hell, maybe not more than three, we’ll see.”\n\nEvans admitted that as he has gotten older, it’s become harder to practice.\n\n“The games are the fun part. The games are easy. It’s training all year. I know it’s routine, but it takes a toll as you get older,” he said.\n\n“I stay in shape. I learned that a long time ago, and I wished I’d learned it sooner. Like, my first two years, I was big. ... When you see the pictures, I have a fat face and love handles that are a little bigger. Now I give my trainer a week or two after the season. We start light, and we just build up gradually.”\n\nFamily is Evans’ biggest priority. Two years ago, his wife, Ashli, convinced him to re-sign with the Bucs for two years and $41 million. The couple have three children together: daughters Ariah Lynn and Aliyah Nicole, and son Amari Thomas, along with a stepdaughter named Mackenzie.\n\n“It motivates me to play longer,” Evans said. “They keep me younger.”\n\nThere also is a big financial component for both the Bucs and Evans to consider.\n\nThe player who most resembles Evans in terms of production and age is Davante Adams, who signed a two-year, $44 million deal with the Rams last March. But Chris Godwin will enter the second year of a three-year, $66 million deal, and the Bucs are suddenly loaded at receiver with Evans, Godwin, Emeka Egbuka, Jalen McMillan and Tez Johnson. Of course, 2025 tested that depth.\n\nWhile money won’t be what determines Evans’ future, it would be naïve to think it isn’t a factor.\n\n“The money’s great, and I just love the game. I love to compete,“ he said. ”And while I’m blessed to still have this ability, I’m going to try to maximize it.\n\n“I’ve got a lot of friends and family. There’s so much behind the scenes that nobody will ever know about. But that’s the other thing that motivates me. And I’m seeing the contracts and I’m like, ‘Wow, that’s crazy.’ I mean, I don’t make what Ja’Marr Chase is getting, $40 million a year? And I’m half of that. It’s still great money. It’s money you dream of making.”\n\nThe last time Evans was a free agent, he had offers from the Chiefs and Texans. Patrick Mahomes is coming off an ACL injury but is expected back by the start of the 2026 regular season. Houston is only 50 miles from Evans’ hometown of Galveston, and the Texans have a Super Bowl-caliber defense.\n\nIf Evans is merely chasing a ring, it might make more sense for him to sign with a team like Buffalo with quarterback Josh Allen or the Patriots with Drake Maye.\n\nRetirement doesn’t seem like it will be Evans’ first choice. His kids are homeschooled, and the family splits time between Tampa and Texas.\n\nHe knows he has a few more good years left, and once you put the keys on the table it’s hard to pick them back up again.\n\n“That’s what every athlete wants to do,” Evans said in August. “Like LeBron (James) or Tom (Brady). They wish they could do that. That’s what I’m trying to maximize. I’m not going to play 20 years, but I’m going to try to play as long as I can while I’m at the top of my game.”\n\nAt the time, Evans sounded like he wanted to keep playing. Mayfield makes some good points: He won’t want to go out playing in only eight games, catching only 30 passes and missing the playoffs.\n\nBut he needs some time and space to make a decision.\n\nEvery weekday, tune into our Sports Day Tampa Bay podcast to hear reporter Rick Stroud break down the biggest stories in Tampa Bay sports.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

    "description": "Twanna Harris explains the emotional and financial challenges of parenting NFL athletes and why she founded League of Industry Moms.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Twanna Harris, the founder of League of Industry Moms. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm a mom to two athletes. Between my husband and me, we have four kids, two sons and two daughters. William, my oldest, has played for the Washington Commanders for seven years. My son Trey is what we call our \"next kid up.\" He is at Sam Houston State University, and he's started training for the NFL draft.\n\nMy husband played in the NFL, so I believe our family is uniquely equipped to navigate this process and provide structure and discipline.\n\nHowever, there were things that surprised me, even though I was not expecting them.\n\nInjuries are actually the last thing I'm worried about.\n\nI am the one who has guided my sons to where they are today. I researched programs, coordinated the move to other schools when necessary, identified trainers, researched colleges that provide the best opportunity, and provided the necessary financial, emotional, and mental support to properly navigate the transition from high school to college, in preparation for making it to the pros.\n\nWhen going through that transition, I felt like the sentiment was, \"Thanks so much for your contribution, but we'll take it from here.\" There weren't conversations with us parents about how to navigate and sustain salaries once they went pros, for example.\n\nAdditionally, I didn't get any coaching or direction on how to choose the best advisor or counsel for your athlete's specific situation.\n\nI helped one of my sons go through a rough patch, which had isolating moments, and I knew I couldn't be the only mother trying to figure this out by myself. This drove my desire for community, and after speaking with numerous mothers of athletes, I quickly realized that what I experienced was more of the norm than the exception.\n\nBecause there's no blueprint or guidebook, I launched my collective, League of Industry Moms, to crowdsource support and resources to help us navigate this terrain together.\n\nWe look into everything from media training to financial literacy, such as how kids should set up their finances for when they are 50, and helping them understand the significance of their spending for the next five years.\n\nTypically, a kid is not celebrated daily for their job. But because my kids are athletes, they are — and are receiving death threats at the same time. Nothing feels real anymore, and it feels like everyone's coming to get a piece of your child. One day, we're in this together as a family, and the next, your kid is saying, \"Hey Mom, I'm an adult now, I don't need your permission to take a $425,000 check.\"\n\nBecause they are legally adults, there's no requirement for brands to speak with parents. There can be a false sense of reality here because, early on, players receive a substantial amount of resources, attention, and money. There's no player association or union, so I've partnered with an organization called athletes.org to make sure we are educating parents going through this.\n\nMy husband and I have raised our kids to be extraordinarily independent. The whole point is to raise kids to be self-sufficient, but this is a different kind of survival. Someone whose frontal lobe has yet to develop is being handed a check for millions, and they are expected to have the wherewithal to know what to do with that.\n\nThe most important thing my husband and I wanted to teach our athletes is the art of listening and the discernment gained through that process to detect when someone might be motivated by the wrong intentions or when something they are saying simply doesn't sound right.",

Well he compares his thought process to Anya Taylor-Joy's character in the Netflix hit The Queen's Gambit.

Webb interviewed for head coaching jobs with the Raiders, Bills and Ravens. pic.twitter.com/4FYpPGQ0MX\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 30, 2026\n\nDavis Webb was considered a favorite for the Las Vegas Raiders head coaching job, but all signs point to them favoring Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak instead. Both the Cardinals and the Raiders are waiting until this weekend to meet with him in hopes of hiring him after the Super Bowl. With the writing on the wall and likely not wanting to be the backup option, Webb withdrew his name from consideration.\n\nWith Webb officially out of the Raiders’ head coaching search, he becomes one of the hottest offensive coordinator names currently on the market. Several teams, including the Baltimore Ravens, New York Giants, and Philadelphia Eagles (before they hired their OC earlier today) have already put in requests to interview Webb for their offensive coordinator positions. Also, his current team, the Denver Broncos, fired offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi and would like to promote Webb to offensive coordinator if possible.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Webb will interview with the Ravens, Giants, or any other teams for their offensive coordinator jobs. He has impressed in interviews, is viewed as an up-and-coming coach, and is well-liked and regarded around the league so it would make sense for teams to be interested. However, with the Broncos firing Lombardi and opening up their offensive coordinator position, you have to assume there is mutual interest between the two sides and that the Broncos are the favorites to land him as their offensive coordinator.\n\nWebb would benefit from another year under Sean Payton and would get more valuable experience as his offensive coordinator. While he may not call plays, he would be in the booth, communicating with Payton throughout the game, and would be a key part of game-planning each week.\n\nThere is no guarantee that Webb will return to the Broncos, as other teams can and likely will offer him play-calling opportunities, but I believe they will make a strong push for him. This should unfold in the coming days, and hopefully, Webb returns to the Broncos, this time, as their offensive coordinator.",

From coaching staff to free agency to the 2026 NFL draft, the Cowboys are treasure hunting.\n\nMidway through Senior Bowl week, some draft hopefuls are standing out amongst their peers. The hope for Cowboys fans is that some of these standouts are at positions of need for Dallas. The Cowboys need to add players at linebacker, defensive end, safety, offensive tackle and cornerback, just to name a few. As luck would have it, some of those players are indeed flashing in practice.\n\nEarly standout reports have highlighted the defensive ends who have been jumping off the screen. The one’s mentioned here at Cowboys Wire have continued their strong play and should firmly be on Dallas’ radar this April. Today we look at three more.\n\nBud Clark has been turning heads here at the midpoint. The 6-foot-1, 185-pound safety from TCU was an intriguing prospect from the start. Over the past two seasons, he’s scored the third best film grade in the country. Despite a diminutive stature, Clark has been showing up as a run defender in the box, putting to bed some size concerns about his jump to the NFL.\n\nClark has been making plays on the ball in coverage and filling gaps against the run, proving to be a do-it-all defensive back. In 2023 he played 393 snaps in the slot, but over the last two seasons he’s mixed it up evenly between slot, box and deep.\n\nClark is the ideal candidate to replace free agent Donovan Wilson for the Cowboys because he can be moved everywhere including a nickel role. Clark is rocketing up draft boards and should move into the top 100 (currently a consensus rank of 185)\n\nDeath, taxes, Bud Clark making plays at the Senior Bowl.\n\nTCU safety has been a star all week. pic.twitter.com/nm3nZWRlwP\n\n— Max Chadwick (@CFBMaxChadwick) January 29, 2026\n\nJacob Rodriguez has proven he’s every bit as advertised. The Tech standout has been everywhere on the field, picking off balls in coverage and punching out balls in the open field. In this extremely deep LB class, Rodriguez is a star.\n\nPhysical traits stand to hold him back on draft boards, but the kid is a mental giant who just makes plays. Rodriguez has set the bar at the LB position scoring the highest PFF score all time amongst Power-4 LB prospects. Given he’ll probably be a Day 2 pick, he’s going to be a steal for someone this year.\n\nTexas Tech’s Jacob Rodriguez had an all-time performance for a LB on Day 2 of the Senior Bowl. \n\nNot only did he show off his peanut punch with a forced fumble, but he also had an INT to end the day and was the best LB in coverage in one-on-ones pic.twitter.com/W8yEm4F2k7\n\n— Bobby Football (@Rob__Paul) January 29, 2026\n\nAt just under 6-foot and weighing 183 pounds, Malik Mohammad isn’t the typical tall CB the Cowboys are attracted to but he’s making it up in tenacity and stickiness at the Senior Bowl. Quick and fluid, Muhammad has shown he can stay with any build, both outside and inside.\n\nThe Cowboys are in the market for a new CB with inside ability. They felt the loss of Jourdan Lewis immensely and this prospect appears to be a great replacement option.\n\nMalik Muhammad continues to stack good rep after good rep pic.twitter.com/AQNk9J2Poz\n\n— TJ Wengert (@TJWengert) January 28, 2026\n\nYou can follow Reid on X @ReidDHanson and be sure to follow Cowboys Wire on Facebook to join in on the conversation with fellow fans!\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cowboys Wire: Midway checkpoint: 3 local Senior Bowl standouts who fit the Cowboys",

    "fullText": "The Las Vegas Raiders will interview Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak over the weekend before making a head coach decision, according to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler.\n\nOne source told Fowler that “it’s probably (Kubiak’s) job to lose.”\n\nDenver Broncos offensive pass game coordinator and quarterbacks coach Davis Webb is also a candidate for the Las Vegas job, and it appears that it might be down to Kubiak and Webb. If the Raiders end up hiring Kubiak, Webb will have plenty of offensive coordinator offers.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens, Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants all requested OC interviews with Webb, and he will presumably be a candidate for Denver's own OC opening after the team fired Joe Lombardi.\n\nIn addition to Las Vegas, the Arizona Cardinals are also yet to hire a head coach, and Broncos defensive coordinator Vance Joseph is a candidate (but perhaps not the favorite) for that position. Arizona also plans to interview Kubiak this weekend, and he seems to be the top candidate for both openings. If Kubiak ends up with the Raiders, it's possible that Joseph could still be in play for the Cardinals.\n\nMeanwhile, Denver assistant head coach and defensive pass game coordinator Jim Leonhard interviewed for the Los Angeles Chargers' defensive coordinator role before L.A. hired Chris O'Leary. Leonhard is believed to be a top candidate for the Buffalo Bills' DC opening, and the Baltimore Ravens have requested a DC interview with him.\n\nIf Joseph does land the HC job in Arizona, Leonhard would presumably be a top in-house candidate to replace him with the Broncos. As it stands now, though, Joseph does not appear to be the clear favorite for the Cards' job, and Leonhard will have no shortage of suitors with DC openings.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: Denver Broncos: Davis Webb, Vance Joseph and Jim Leonhard updates",

No other team since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 has ever done that.\n\nWhat’s more, New England had to win three outdoor games in winter conditions, which got progressively worse throughout January. By the second half of the AFC title game against the Denver Broncos, the Patriots were basically playing in a blizzard.\n\nThe elements, tough defenses and pressure seemed to get to Drake Maye a bit, whose performance suffered in the postseason compared to his MVP-caliber regular season. These were the first true challenges of his career in just his second NFL season and first postseason run, and he was learning the hard way.\n\nDrake Maye: \"It's hard… Good God\"\n\nJosh McDaniels: \"Look at me, it's gonna be hard, but look, this will be the most rewarding 6 1/2 minutes of our lives if we can get it done.\" 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥\n\nThe vulnerability here… holy moly man. \n\n🎥: @Patriots pic.twitter.com/CyoaTUQpti\n\n— Michael Rodnick (@MJRodnick) January 28, 2026\n\n“Hey, it’s hard,” he told New England’s offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels late in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s game as snow rained down on them in Denver.\n\nMcDaniels, who’s in his 19th season with the Patriots coaching staff, is well aware. He’s been part of countless playoff games in tough conditions and is going to his ninth Super Bowl.\n\nFortunately for New England, he was able to help calm Maye down and give him some wise advice.\n\n“I know,” McDaniels said, laughing. “Listen to me. Look at me. It’s gonna be hard, but look, this will be the most rewarding six and a half minutes of our lives if we can get it done.”\n\nMaye took those words to heart, buckling down and finishing the job himself. He sealed the Patriots’ 10-7 win by running through the snow for a first down after the two-minute warning, punching their tickets to the Super Bowl.\n\nPatriots Predicted To Add Tight End Coming Off Eight-Touchdown Year",

Drake Maye ranked outside of the top 10 in passing yards after the catch, meaning there is room to improve.\n\nYahoo Sports’ Nate Tice predicted the Patriots would draft University of Oregon tight end Kenyon Sadiq with the 31st pick of the NFL Draft.\n\n“While Sadiq is a tight end, the Patriots need pass catchers, especially ones who can create explosives with the ball in their hands,” Tice wrote on Tuesday. “Offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels loves to use tight ends, and Maye has loved throwing the ball to Hunter Henry in his first two seasons. Sadiq would give them a weapon who can turn those screens and underneath routes into big plays. He has the speed and receiving ability to stretch the defense, and also some real grit as a blocker that Mike Vrabel would love.”\n\nSadiq had 560 yards on 51 receptions last season. He scored eight touchdowns as well. In three seasons at Oregon, he had 892 yards and 11 receiving touchdowns. He averaged 11.2 yards per reception in college.\n\nHe led Oregon in receiving touchdowns and was third on the team in receiving yards per game. At 6-foot-3, 245 pounds, he may be undersized for a tight end, but he has tremendous speed and can be a difference maker for the Patriots.\n\nWhat Josh McDaniels Told Drake Maye To Seal Patriots’ AFC Championship",

Fields had a dubious distinction in a Week 6 loss to the Broncos. He was sacked nine times in producing a franchise-worst minus-10 net passing yards. Fields was benched nine games into the season.”\n\nThere’s a possibility that the Steelers could reunite with Fields this offseason, especially if Aaron Rodgers doesn’t come back.

    "fullText": "You'll be hard-pressed to find a large majority of Americans who agree with one another on the same subject in 2026, but the Bill Belichick's Hall of Fame snub seems to be doing just that – and even the ever-divisive President of the United States is weighing in on the matter.\n\nDonald Trump took to Truth Social on Wednesday to share his thoughts on Belichick after he was snubbed from the 2026 Pro Football Hall of Fame class. Belichick, a 29-year NFL head-coaching veteran with six Super Bowl rings, was considered a first-ballot selection by most fans. Still, we learned on Tuesday that he did not receive enough votes to be inducted in his first year of eligibility.\n\nTrump is considered a rather controversial figure these days, but his opinion on the matter seemed to be right in line with most of the NFL fanbase as he blasted the decision on social media. He also took shots in the same post at what he describes as the 'sissy' kickoff rule, referring to the new Dynamic Kickoff Rule implemented by the league ahead of the 2024 season.\n\n𝗕𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴: President Donald Trump went OFF on the NFL voters defending his close friend Bill Belichick should've been a first ballot Hall of Famer.\n\n“It is the same mindset that gave pro football the unwatchable 'Sissy' Kickoff Rule, that made it possible for Bill to not… pic.twitter.com/qMwbJcJmCH\n\n— Dov Kleiman (@NFL_DovKleiman) January 28, 2026\n\n“It is the same mindset that gave pro football the new and unwatchable ‘Sissy’ Kickoff Rule, that made it possible for Bill Belichick to not be elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame,” Trump wrote Wednesday. “Both are ridiculous and should be overturned!”\n\nIt is not Trump's first time criticizing moves regarding the NFL and its personnel, calling the new kickoff rule 'ridiculous' in 2025. Recently, Trump announced he wouldn't attend Super Bowl LX in San Francisco because it is \"too far away,\" while blasting the scheduled musical performances by Bad Bunny and Green Day.\n\n“I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred.

    "fullText": "The Bill Belichick snub led to another compelling storyline regarding the role of Hall of Fame G.M. Bill Polian in the outcome. A day later, an important point of clarification has emerged.\n\nPolian, after saying he voted for Belichick before saying he can't say with 100 percent certainty whether he did, says he did indeed vote for his former New England nemesis.\n\n“I voted for coach Belichick in the Hall of Fame selection meeting,” Polian said in an appearance on SiriusXM NFL Radio, after explaining he was reading from a prepared statement. “The Pro Football Hall of Fame has confirmed that fact through the auditors of the selection process. Again, I’ll state that I never said that I believe that Coach Belichick should quote, wait a year, close quote, for enshrinement. This has been confirmed by the Pro Football Hall of Fame, numerous selectors who were in the room, and my vote for coach Belichick. As a Hall of Fame member and selector, I realize the import of what we do. I’ve always tried as a selector to make these difficult choices with the utmost of objectivity. I’ve said on SiriusXM Radio and numerous other media outlets that I believe Coach Belichick to be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, my vote confirms that.”\n\nUltimately, it doesn't matter. Not enough of the voters voted for Belichick. At least 11 of 50 failed to include Belichick among three selections from a group that included Belichick, Patriots owner Robert Kraft, and seniors candidates Ken Anderson, Roger Craig, and L.C. Greenwood.\n\nFrom those five choices, who would be your three? And is there any way Belichick wouldn't be one of them?",

    "description": "He is one of the most winningest coaches in NFL history, but his snub from the Pro Footbal Hall of Fame adds to a growing list of defeats.",
    "fullText": "While the New England Patriots prepare for their 12th Super Bowl appearance, their former head coach Bill Belichick - widely considered to be the greatest professional football coach of all time - finds himself in an unlikely position: defending his legacy.\n\nAlthough Belichick has the most Super Bowl victories in NFL history, he received a phone call on Friday notifying him he would not be inducted into this year's Pro Football Hall of Fame class.\n\n\"Six Super Bowls isn't enough?\" Belichick asked with disappointment, according to ESPN which broke the news, referring to his six wins with the Patriots.\n\nThe latest setback adds to a series of misfortunes for Belichick, who ended his nearly 50-year NFL coaching career on a losing streak, and, in a rather unexpected decision, left the pinnacle of American football to coach college students.\n\nJust a few months ago, Belichick made his college football debut to a sell-out crowd of over 50,000 people packed into University of North Carolina's football stadium.\n\nWhen he walked onto the field for the first time, the roar of tens of thousands of screaming fans erupted into the night sky.\n\nThe Tar Heels suffered a stinging defeat to the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs that night, and never quite recovered. By the end of the 12-game season, the team finished with just four wins – its worst record since 2018.\n\nThe paradox between Belichick's legendary NFL career and his spectacularly poor first year in college football is complicating his legacy. After nearly 50 years coaching professional football, why Belichick accepted an offer to step down to the amateur leagues remains a big question. When he will quit is becoming an even bigger one.\n\n\"He's going to have one of the biggest challenges of his coaching career trying to get year two to be better than year one in North Carolina,\" said Dan Roche, an award-winning sports anchor with the BBC's US media partner, CBS News.\n\n\"If they struggle again, I think that will basically be the end of the coaching career of Bill Belichick,\" he continued.\n\nFor years, the trend in college football has been that coaches typically leave the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for greater prestige and bigger salaries in the NFL.\n\nBut the college league – which generates over $1.3bn (£940.5m) in revenue – is starting to catch up.\n\n\"North Carolina decided to roll the dice and invest a lot of money in its football program,\" said Greg Barnes, senior reporter at Inside Carolina, a website dedicated to North Carolina University sports.\n\nAnd with that came Belichick, who signed a five-year $50m (£36m) deal to join the Tar Heels.\n\n\"That kind of money is unheard of for North Carolina football,\" Barnes said, notwithstanding that the contract went to 73-year-old Belichick who previously had never coached a single game of college football.\n\nMost sports experts who've followed his career suspect he's not in it for the money.\n\nFor Belichick, they say, it's part love of the game, part love for coaching, and part an affliction that has ailed many great sports figures: an inability to know when to say goodbye.\n\n\"I can't recall many head coaches who have said, 'Okay, I've done it all, and now I'm going to walk away',\" Roche said. \"I just think they don't have it in them.\"\n\nBelichick was born into a football family.\n\nHis father, Steve Belichick, had a long college coaching career, including 30 years at the US Naval Academy and two years at North Carolina.\n\nThe younger Belichick's understanding of football was also nurtured by his mother, Jeannette, with whom he spent many weekends watching games on TV.\n\nBelichick played football and lacrosse at Wesleyan University where he graduated in 1975 with an economics degree. Having never played in the professional league, he began his NFL career that same year as a staff assistant.\n\n\"He doesn't look like a football coach. He's not an overwhelming physical presence. He's not a screamer,\" said ESPN senior writer Seth Wickersham. \"He's kind of a quirky, introverted thinker.\"\n\n\"And he revolutionised professional football,\" Wickersham said.\n\nHowever, he truly forged his legacy during his decades-long career as the New England Patriots head coach.\n\nHe joined the team in 2000. One year later, with the help of quarterback Tom Brady, they won their first Super Bowl. Then five more after that. Altogether, the Brady-and-Belichick-led Patriots appeared in the Super Bowl nine times, the most under any single head coach in NFL history .\n\nMike Reiss, an ESPN staff writer who covers the Patriots, attributed Belichick's success to being \"a master strategist\".\n\n\"When he was at his peak powers, he almost knew the opposition more than the opposition knew themselves,\" Reiss said.\n\nBelichick's critics point to a series of scandals that rocked the Patriots during his tenure, including in 2007 when he was fined $500,000 (£362,000) for ordering his staff to spy on other teams, and in 2016, when Brady was suspended for four games for deflating footballs to his advantage.\n\nIn 2020, Brady left the Patriots, reportedly in part due to Belichick's unwillingness to give Brady, then-aged 43, the longer contract Brady wanted.\n\nBrady joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers the same year and won his seventh Super Bowl. In Belichick's final two seasons with the Patriots, he led the team to one of its worst records since the 1990s.\n\nBelichick and the Patriots mutually agreed to part ways in January 2024. He was unable to find another NFL team to take him after that.\n\n\"It was a stunning rebuke by the NFL,\" said Wickersham, author of New York Times bestseller It's Better to be Feared: The New England Patriots Dynasty and the Pursuit of Greatness.\n\n\"For the first time since 1975\", Wickersham said, \"Belichick was out of football\".\n\nIt was during one of the lowest points of Belichick's professional career that he received the call from North Carolina.\n\nOutside of a few sceptics, college football fans were engulfed in enthusiasm.\n\n\"Congrats coach,\" Tom Brady posted on social media. \"The Tar Heel way is about to become a thing 100.\"\n\nWith his name emblazoned on merchandise, home-game tickets for the entire season sold out weeks before it started.\n\nBut Belichick was unable to reverse the bad fortune that appeared to follow him from his final years in the NFL.\n\nAfter their defeat in game one, the Tar Heels would go on to lose most games, including every match against their three in-state rivals, something the team hadn't done since 1989.\n\nAs the season losses piled up, so did the number of empty seats inside North Carolina's football stadium.\n\nFor some, like North Carolina Alumni Association member Deborah Melvin, it was painful to witness even from home.\n\n\"It was just disheartening,\" she said. \"He was supposed to be Mr Super Coach.\"\n\nAdding to fans' frustrations was the incessant press coverage of Belichick's romantic relationship with Jordon Hudson, a 24-year-old beauty pageant contestant and amateur cheerleader.\n\nWickersham called it \"the most scrutinized relationship ever for an American sports coach\".\n\nHudson made headlines. Lots of headlines. Like when she was rumoured to have been banned from North Carolina's athletic facilities and the university had to put out a statement saying she wasn't. Or the time when she appeared next to Belichick on the sidelines on game day wearing a reptile mini-skirt and knee-high boots. Or the time when she filed a trademark application for the term \"gold digger\".\n\nBelichick couldn't avoid the gossip columns either, making his own headlines amid multiple appearances at Hudson's cheerleading competitions and beauty pageants.\n\nWickersham said he found the Belichick-Hudson saga to be \"surprising\", adding that it contributed to the noise surrounding Belichick who previously \"was a master at limiting distractions\".\n\n\"It's definitely different than the Belichick who was with New England all those years,\" Wickersham said.\n\nThe university declined a request from the BBC to interview Belichick.\n\nThe Tar Heels' bad season has not been blamed on Hudson, though. It was a variety of other factors.\n\nThis was Belichick's first time coaching a college football team, a group composed of a bunch of teenagers with often much steeper learning curves compared to the pros of the NFL.\n\nThe other major challenge was recruiting. Belichick joined the Tar Heels after the deadline for high school athletes to accept their college offers. That meant he missed the chance to persuade some of America's best high school football talent to join his team this year.\n\n\"To get the system in place is more than just turning a light switch on,\" North Carolina football manager Mike Lombardi said after the season.\n\n\"I'm not making any excuses, but when we first got here, we didn't have time to turn the light switch on,\" he said. \"We had to just get into the dark room.\"\n\nLombardi's remarks came during a signing ceremony on 3 December, as the team celebrated the new class of recruits joining the Tar Heels' next season.\n\n\"They will be a foundation of our program,\" Belichick said.\n\nFor now, quitting does not appear to be an option for the all-time great coach.\n\n\"'Why are you still doing this? You could be doing anything,'\" Weiss said he once asked Belichick toward the end of his career with the Patriots. \"And he replied, 'It beats working.'\n\n\"I'll never forget that, because I feel like this is what he feels like he was born to do.\"",

    "title": "Ranking every NFL coaching hire in 2026 after Browns add Todd Monken",
    "description": "Todd Monken's hire by the Browns leaves only two NFL head-coaching vacancies left. But which additions were the best moves?",
    "fullText": "One of the wildest NFL coaching carousels in league history is finally approaching a standstill.\n\nWith 10 head-coaching vacancies popping up, the onset of the offseason was far more active than anyone could have anticipated. But after the Cleveland Browns' hiring of Todd Monken on Wednesday, Jan. 28, all but two openings – those of the Arizona Cardinals and Las Vegas Raiders – have been filled, and the initial rush for the top candidates is long over.\n\nGiven the myriad unknowns and extenuating circumstances when assessing what went right or wrong at the very top for any team, evaluating head-coaching hires can be notoriously difficult. With that said, here is our initial ranking of all the coaching hires so far:\n\nOn Black Monday, it seemed as though this year's candidate pool lacked the equivalent of a Mike Vrabel or Ben Johnson. One day later, John Harbaugh was thrown into the mix and became the clear headliner.\n\nExpecting the former Ravens coach to replicate what the New England Patriots or Chicago Bears achieved in Year 1 of their new regimes would be unreasonable. Still, Harbaugh's track record – just three losing seasons in 18 years – is the stuff of dreams for a Giants franchise tied for the fewest wins since 2017 (44).\n\nHarbaugh was the one option this cycle who looked capable of flipping an organization's culture, even if it required some uncomfortable shifts. Given how set in their ways the Giants have been, the transformation might not take place overnight. But Big Blue has seen sharp play-callers flame out, so inspiring hope was going to necessitate finding someone capable of addressing the very core of the organization.\n\nIn Harbaugh, they now have that.\n\nParting with Harbaugh only to turn to a family disciple might seem like a strange move. But in hiring Jesse Minter, Baltimore can hold onto much of what worked for the previous regime while still finding a fresh voice and direction for the franchise.\n\nWidely lauded for both his schematic acumen and his ability to connect with others, Minter already has an extensive track record of bringing along young players. That no doubt was a major draw for a Ravens team with a top-heavy roster and a firm commitment to developing home-grown talent. In Los Angeles, Minter's remaking of the defense took hold almost instantly. The Ravens might be due for a bit more upheaval on that side of the ball than they're accustomed to, but Minter could help the franchise return to its roots. At the very least, he can help the unit cut down on the considerable number of lapses that became an unfortunate running theme last season.\n\nOf course, that fails to address a pretty crucial factor: Who guides Lamar Jackson and the offense? Securing the right offensive play-caller is one of the vital early steps for Minter, and succeeding on that front might necessitate finding another answer in a year or two if his coordinator of choice flourishes and earns head-coaching consideration. But there are several promising options available, all of whom should be eager to join this staff and work with a two-time NFL MVP in Jackson.\n\nGiven owner Arthur Blank's impatience in ending the league's second-longest active playoff drought, Harbaugh understandably would have been the big prize here. But landing a two-time NFL Coach of the Year should be more than a satisfactory outcome for the Falcons.\n\nIt's fair to wonder how much blame Kevin Stefanski bears for an 8-26 record in his final two years with the Cleveland Browns. There's no questioning his resourcefulness, though, and that trait should come in handy as he takes on a far less imposing undertaking than the one he had been saddled with. His wide-zone scheme is bound to be a boon for All-Pro running back Bijan Robinson, and he can help compensate for the lack of wide receiver threats beyond Drake London.\n\nThe hiccup here could be in the potential disconnect between Stefanski's tendencies and quarterback Michael Penix Jr.'s strengths, which haven't included attacking the middle of the field, working from under center or operating with reliable precision. Stefanski might have been best off coming aboard two years ago, when the team was first finding its way with his former pupil, Kirk Cousins. But Atlanta couldn't afford to center its coaching search on Penix, who is coming off a torn anterior cruciate ligament.\n\nMaybe this isn't an outright moon shot. Yet with the NFC South still looking eminently winnable, this feels like substantial progress toward at least joining the conference's second tier of contenders. Bonus points, too, for retaining defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich, who revved up the long-dormant pass rush and helped several young defenders break out in 2025.\n\nPerhaps feeling some pangs of remorse after parting with Mike Vrabel and giving an unproven entity in Brian Callahan a shot, the Titans went hard at second-time head coaches this cycle. In all, 14 of the 18 candidates they interviewed had prior experience running a franchise. With Robert Saleh, Tennessee ended up doling out a second chance to someone who has shown enough to indicate things might go smoother than they did in his first go-around.\n\nPerhaps the optics weren't great in the early going, as the first three hires this cycle all materialized ahead of scheduled visits with the Titans. But credit Tennessee for not being overly rigid in its process, which many assumed would be focused on pairing 2025 No. 1 pick Cam Ward with an offensive play-caller for a head coach.\n\nSaleh did superlative work in keeping a San Francisco 49ers defense ravaged by injuries afloat, and his plan to hang onto defensive play-calling duties while serving as head coach should facilitate an expedited turnaround on that side of the ball. Though his first stop featured plenty of mishaps with cultural development and locker room management, Saleh surely took away some lessons in what not to do at his next opportunity. And in bringing on former Giants head coach Brian Daboll as offensive coordinator to guide Ward's development, he's gotten off to a promising start in establishing a framework for the franchise to actually compete for the first time since Vrabel's firing.\n\nWith Tennessee having an estimated league-high $93.5 million in cap space, according to Over The Cap, and few promising pieces beyond Ward, Saleh at least sizes up as someone who should prove skillful in building from the ground floor.\n\nIn a vacuum, Joe Brady is a perfectly qualified candidate who would invigorate plenty of franchises. He entered the season as one of the most prominent names on the market after deciding to stay put last winter, and his play-calling acumen might be unmatched in a thin pool of offensive-minded options.\n\nBut any assessment of the Bills' hire has to take into account the circumstances of their puzzling firing of Sean McDermott and the even more baffling justification put forth by owner Terry Pegula and general manager Brandon Beane. Now, after giving every indication that the team needs to get over the \"proverbial playoff wall\" that Pegula referenced, the franchise is turning to ... a first-time head coach – and, at 36, the youngest in the NFL – who was interwoven with the issues that Pegula and Beane seemed to cite as grounds for McDermott's dismissal.\n\nPegula seemed to center Josh Allen throughout the process, including having the quarterback shape the search for McDermott's replacement. Viewed through that lens, Brady makes ample sense for Buffalo after he proved capable of orchestrating a versatile attack despite several glaring personnel limitations, particularly at receiver.\n\nPerhaps the Bills took a look around at their external options and simply weren't moved by any of the choices. (It's worth noting that they were unable to speak with Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak given the timing of McDermott's firing and the Seahawks' Super Bowl run.) But after crowing about the need for change, why skew so heavily toward the familiar?\n\nThere's clearly considerable upside for Brady here, but the challenge facing him is immense. Not only must he figure out a way to push Allen and the offense forward after the unit ranked fourth in both total yards and points in 2025, but he'll have to do so while taking on a host of unfamiliar game-management and big-picture responsibilities. Meanwhile, who leads a defense that experienced worse talent atrophy than Beane might like to admit? The cap situation – Buffalo is currently projected to be nearly $14 million overdrawn, according to Over The Cap – is also a little foreboding for a team that has several key pending free agents worth keeping – and several more who should be brought in.\n\nThere's a solid chance that the Bills can be a playoff mainstay and top-tier AFC contender under Brady. The problem for him, however, is that Buffalo has made clear that those accomplishments won't suffice.\n\nBut there's a bit more of an unknown element to him than there is for others on this list.\n\nHafley managed to revitalize the Packers' defense almost immediately upon his arrival. His creativity in navigating the unit's deficiencies at various points augurs well for a team that presents a plethora of its own shortcomings. The Dolphins could also stand to benefit from a shift in accountability after repeatedly reverting to finger-pointing under Mike McDaniel.\n\nStill, this is a lot to take on for someone whose only prior head-coaching experience was at Boston College. The Dolphins probably made the shrewd move in riding things out with a fresh face rather than expecting a retread hire to turn things around right away. But Hafley might have a harder time than some of his peers in filling out a staff capable of accounting for all his blind spots as he takes the wheel. The promotion of Bobby Slowik to offensive coordinator seems like a risky move given the pervasive protection problems he couldn't solve during his run as the Houston Texans' coordinator.\n\nAfter Mike Tomlin's resignation, chairman Art Rooney II made clear the Steelers wouldn't be undergoing a rebuild. And here's the proof.\n\nIn hiring the 62-year-old McCarthy, who has a career 60.8% winning percentage and a Super Bowl title on his résumé but little postseason success to speak of in the last decade, Pittsburgh proved it prized steady stewardship above all. On some level, that's understandable for a franchise that hasn't known what it's like to be truly out of the playoff hunt in the last 20 years. McCarthy has also demonstrated he's still a savvy play-caller − his 2022 and '23 offenses ranked fourth and first in scoring, respectively − who has unparalleled experience in leading storied organizations after his runs with the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys.\n\nBut unlike the Giants, the Steelers aren't a team needing the floor to be raised. Pittsburgh has taken up residence in the AFC's second tier without much of a threat of breaking through to the first, with its postseason win drought now standing at nine seasons.\n\nIt's difficult to see how McCarthy changes that dynamic much, even if the baseline doesn't stray too far from a .500 mark. And while the stellar quarterback play that has accompanied his past two stops might be seen as a major draw for a franchise facing plenty of uncertainty behind center, there's not much to suggest he has a substantial advantage over the field in developing a young passer − a task the Steelers desperately need to embrace but might again resist.\n\nPerhaps the most problematic element of this decision was the stretch run of the process. Pittsburgh held virtual interviews with both Los Angeles Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula − considered by many to be a leading candidate for the role − and Rams passing game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase. But rather than wait until after the NFC championship game for the opportunity to speak in person with both, the Steelers plowed ahead with McCarthy, who hadn't been in the mix for any of the other remaining vacancies. This was the perfect opportunity for Pittsburgh to step back and consider the full scope of its options. Instead, it opted for the familiar and unthreatening choice.\n\nIn the past few years, two of the more notable respectability plays for hires − the Las Vegas Raiders turning to Pete Carroll last year and the Jacksonville Jaguars going to Doug Pederson in 2022 − have flamed out. McCarthy likely won't go bust at the scale that the former did. But this sure feels like a missed opportunity to make up ground on the conference's actual contenders by a franchise more concerned with the prospect of ceding it.\n\nConsider this placement not so much an indictment of Todd Monken as everything Cleveland has done to get to this point.\n\nAs the Ravens' offensive coordinator, Monken proved adept at employing an innovative approach to invigorate what had been a stagnant passing game. Under his watch, the Ravens ranked third and fourth in scoring in the two seasons prior to 2025, when Lamar Jackson's injury and a host of other setbacks muddled the picture for Baltimore. That creativity will surely be needed as Cleveland looks to compensate for massive deficiencies along its offensive line and in its receiving corps. And that's to say nothing of the great unknown behind center.\n\nStill, Monken, who turns 60 next week, is one of the oldest first-time head coaching hires in recent NFL history. And from the three weeks the Browns went in between firing two-time NFL Coach of the Year Kevin Stefanski and settling on his replacement, the franchise served up plenty of reminders of why this job is so daunting.\n\nIn total, three candidates – Jesse Minter, later hired as the Baltimore Ravens' head coach; Mike McDaniel, who settled on becoming the Los Angeles Chargers' offensive coordinator; and Grant Udinski, who opted to remain the Jacksonville Jaguars' offensive coordinator – dropped out of consideration for the role. Per multiple reports, Cleveland's search was colored by a desire to retain defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz, a favorite of owner Jimmy Haslam, in some capacity. With Schwartz losing out on the top role, however, NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported that it was unlikely he would return to the new staff.\n\nHaving served as the team's offensive coordinator in Freddie Kitchens' disastrous one-year run in 2019, Monken is familiar with the Browns' rampant dysfunction. Maybe that will serve him well as he takes on one of the NFL's most imposing jobs. But it seems clear that the Browns' shift away from Stefanski lacked much of a vision for where the organization wanted to end up.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: NFL coach hirings 2026: Ranking every hire as Browns add Todd Monken",

    "description": "Shedeur Sanders joins an elite group of Colorado Buffaloes to earn NFL Pro Bowl honors. Here’s every former Buff to make a Pro Bowl roster.",
    "fullText": "In light of Shedeur Sanders being added to the AFC Pro Bowl roster yesterday as a replacement quarterback, we decided to take a look at the other Colorado Buffaloes who have earned NFL Pro Bowl honors, either as original selections or alternates. Sanders becomes just the second quarterback in program history to make a Pro Bowl, joining Kordell Stewart, who was selected in 2001. He is also only the fourth Colorado player to be named to the Pro Bowl since 2010, alongside LT David Bakhtiari, RB Phillip Lindsay, and OL Andre Gurode.\n\nIn total, 19 Colorado Buffaloes have gone on to become NFL Pro Bowlers.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 12 games played, three interceptions for 13 return yards, 3 fumbles recovered (1959); 12 games played, one interception for 14 return yards (1960).\n\nBrookshier was a standout three-year letterman at the University of Colorado, excelling as a defensive back, fullback, and return specialist. He finished his career with six interceptions and led the nation in punt returns in 1951, averaging 12.0 yards per return.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 14 games played, three interceptions for 41 return yards.\n\nDove was an exceptional running back and defensive back for the University of Colorado from 1956 to 1958. A key contributor in the single-wing offense, he rushed for more than 1,200 yards over his final two seasons and was selected in the third round of the 1959 NFL Draft.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: Was one of the top guards in the NFL and helped Cleveland running backs Jim Brown and Leroy Kelly have historic seasons.\n\nWooten became just the fifth player in Colorado history to earn All-America honors and the first lineman to do so when he was recognized in 1958. A three-year letterman at guard from 1956 to 1958, he was named an All-American by the AFCA in his senior season, following a first-team All-Big Seven selection as a junior the year before.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 14 games played, 44 receptions, 610 receiving yards, four touchdowns (1965); 14 games played, 54 receptions, 836 receiving yards, four touchdowns (1967).\n\nAlthough listed as a quarterback, Dowler was a versatile \"triple-threat\" in Dal Ward's single-wing offense. He caught 41 passes for 628 yards and six touchdowns, threw for 769 yards and seven scores, and averaged 43.6 yards per punt. On defense, he intercepted 10 passes, the second-most in school history at the time. A three-time All-Big Seven selection and honorable mention All-American in 1958, Dowler was later inducted into both the CU Athletic Hall of Fame and the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: Three interceptions for 34 return yards, led the NFL with 5 fumble recoveries and scored one defensive touchdown (1972); Anderson had his peak year in 1973, leading the NFL with 8 interceptions for 163 yards and adding two pick-six touchdowns.

He finished his college career with 14 interceptions and 266 tackles, setting school records at the time. In recognition of his outstanding achievements, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1993.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 14 games played, 51 catches, 983 receiving yards, nine touchdowns (1975); 14 games played, 46 catches, 1,111 receiving yards, 12 touchdowns (1976); 13 games played, 33 catches, 540 receiving yards, six touchdowns (1977); 16 games played, 49 catches, 709 receiving yards, one touchdown (1978).\n\nIn 22 games at Colorado, Branch caught 36 passes for 665 yards and 11 touchdowns while rushing 31 times for 354 yards and five scores, averaging 11.4 yards per carry.

In 1989, he played 16 games, recording five interceptions and a touchdown.\n\nPerry earned All-Big Eight Conference honors and was named an honorable mention All-American in 1974. Known for his speed, he was a key contributor on defense for the Buffaloes before being selected in the 1975 NFL Draft.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: Tackles were not officially recorded, but Johnson was a force and anchored the Eagles' defensive line during this three-year Pro Bowl stint.\n\nIn 1976, the Associated Press (AP) selected Johnson to the first-team All-Big Eight, and he was an honorable mention All-American. He received Colorado's Dave Jones award as the team's most valuable defensive lineman.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: Nine games, one interception (shortened 1982 season); 15 games, three interceptions (1983); 15 games, seven interceptions, two fumble recoveries\n\nAt the time of his graduation, Haynes' 256 career tackles ranked second all-time for a defensive back at Colorado, and his 17 pass deflections were tied for seventh. Known for his speed, running a 4.4-second 40-yard dash, he made a lasting impact on the field and was later named a first-team member of CU's All-Century team in 1989.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 56 total tackles, 13 sacks, three forced fumbles and a fumble recovery\n\nWilliams won the 1990 Butkus Award and led the Buffs to a national championship. A two-time Big Eight Defensive Player of the Year, he finished as CU's all-time leader in sacks (35) and tackles for loss (59), later earning College Football Hall of Fame honors.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 16 games, 48 total tackles, one sack and one fumble recovery\n\nHe was second-team All-Conference as a sophomore, first-team all-Big Eight as a junior, and a second-team All-American selection as a senior.

He played inside linebacker as a freshman and sophomore before moving to the outside, where he recorded 14 quarterback sacks over the next two seasons.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 60.2 percent completion rate, 3,109 passing yards, 14 touchdowns, 11 interceptions; 96 carries, 537 yards, five touchdowns\n\nStewart finished his career as Colorado's leader in both total offense and passing yards with 6,481, and through 2017, he still ranked second and fourth in those categories. His 27-5-1 record as a starter, an 83.3 winning percentage, remains the best in CU history for any quarterback. He was named first-team All-Big Eight as a senior in 1994 and received the Zack Jordan Award as the Buffs' most valuable player, leading Colorado to an 11-1 record and a number three national ranking.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: Started 16 games, recorded 90 tackles, one interception, 12 passes defended and two forced fumbles\n\nAt Colorado, as a senior, he was a unanimous All-Big 12 Conference first-team choice, earned third-team All-America honors, and was a semi-finalist for the Jim Thorpe Award, given to the nation's top defensive back. He led the team with 112 tackles and five interceptions, one of which he returned for a touchdown. He also holds the school record with 6.5 career sacks for a defensive back.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 16 games started, average of 45.3 yards per punt, 66 total punts for 2,987 yards (1999);16 games started, 44.4 yards per punt, 81 total punts for 3,595 yards.\n\nBerger played three seasons at Colorado, where he served as the team's punter and kicker, contributing to the team before being drafted by the NFL in the sixth round.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: Earned five consecutive Pro Bowl selections (2006-2010) as a center for the Dallas Cowboys. He served as a durable anchor on this offensive line, starting all 16 games in 2008, 2009 and 2010.\n\nAt Colorado, Gurode was a first-team All-Big 12 selection in 2000 and 2001, and was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American as a senior in 2001. During his career, he allowed just 7.5 sacks in 2,653 plays as a starter for the Buffaloes.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 15 games, 1,037 rushing yards, nine touchdowns; 35 receptions for 241 yards and one touchdown\n\nLindsay became Colorado's all-time leader in all-purpose yards with 5,760 and yards from scrimmage with 4,683, totals that rise to 5,926 and 4,849, including the 2016 Alamo Bowl. He finished as the Buffs' second all-time leading rusher with 3,707 yards and was the first player in CU history to record back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons, and only the second to do so over any two seasons. With 110 receptions for 976 yards, he also set school records for the most catches and receiving yards by a running back. Lindsay became the 14th player to join CU's 500/500 Club for rushing and receiving yards, narrowly missing the milestone of 1,000 in both categories.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: Started 16 games, allowing only 4 sacks (2016); Started 16 games, earning his second-team All-Pro honors (2019); Started 12 games, allowing only one sack and one quarterback hit, with a 91.8 Pro Football Focus pass-blocking grade before a torn ACL (2020).\n\nA two-time second-team All-Pac 12 selection (2011, 2012) and a 2012 team captain, he was known for his durability and high-grade efficiency, allowing only two-and-a-half sacks in his final season.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 8 games started, 1,400 passing yards, 8 total touchdowns, 10 interceptions\n\nSander finished his 24-start Colorado career 651-of-907 (71.8%) with 7,364 yards, 64 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions. He broke over 100 school records and finished third in passing yards, fifth in attempts, third in completions, first in passing touchdowns, and tops in QB rating.\n\nWith Shedeur Sanders earning his spot as a replacement, the hope is that Colorado can continue to produce more NFL talent and, more importantly, legitimate NFL stars. Entering the 2025 NFL season, 12 former Buffaloes were on active NFL rosters. Those are numbers Deion Sanders is clearly aiming to grow in 2026 and beyond.\n\nContact/Follow us @BuffaloesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook for ongoing coverage of Colorado news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Buffaloes Wire: Every Colorado football player to make an NFL Pro Bowl",

    "fullText": "The LSU Tigers have concluded their football season and while they focus on next year's team, their now former players are focusing on the NFL draft.\n\nAfter an impressive showing in the 2026 East-West Shrine Bowl, former Tigers wideout Chris Hilton Jr. has been a late add to the 2026 Senior Bowl roster, per WAFB's Jacques Doucet.\n\nMany scouts at the Shrine Bowl praised the performance of Hilton. It's no surprise, given that this is an environment built for someone like him to excel. The defense is at a disadvantage and he has speed for days.\n\nThe Zachary product came to Baton Rouge as a highly sought-after recruit. He was the No. 58 overall player in his class, fifth-best wideout and third in Louisiana. His ceiling always felt sky high.\n\nA number of unfortunate injuries and circumstances kept Hilton from really ever getting the opportunity to perform at LSU. He finished his career with 41 catches for 780 yards and six touchdowns. He had a career average of 19 yards per reception.\n\nIf he can stay healthy, he certainly has enough to offer an NFL team for a shot. At the very least, he has the speed for it.\n\nBeing brought over from the Shrine Bowl to the Senior Bowl is a big deal. There were 106 Senior Bowl players drafted last season. That's over 41% of the draft. He will have the chance to compete in two practices before the game and the chance to meet with every single NFL team.\n\nThis would be a fantastic journey to the league if Hilton can continue to impress.",

    "description": "The Super Bowl is in 13 days, but first, the NFL draft community has plenty of time to produce mock […]",
    "fullText": "The Super Bowl is in 13 days, but first, the NFL draft community has plenty of time to produce mock drafts, as seven rounds of new rookies will join the big leagues in three months. And according to NFL.com, the latest and greatest theory for the Minnesota Vikings involves Toledo safety Emmanuel McNeil-Warren.\n\nMcNeil-Warren’s name is rising as a rookie safety option, and the Smith succession question may force Minnesota’s hand.\n\nMcNeil-Warren ranks 39th on the Consensus Big Board as of January 27th, but that didn’t stop Daniel Jeremiah from mock-drafting him to the purple team.\n\nA Harrison Smith replacement is on the mind of NFL.com.\n\nAt the 18th pick, Jeremiah picked McNeil-Warren for Minnesota and noted, “I’m higher on McNeil-Warren than some other people around the league, but I love his combination of size and explosive playmaking ability. He could help replace Harrison Smith if the soon-to-be 37-year-old does indeed retire.”\n\nBefore the Vikings’ pick, Jeremiah mocked Akheem Mesidor, an EDGE rusher from Miami, to the Detroit Lions, and at No. 19, Arizona State wideout Jordan Tyson landed with the Carolina Panthers.\n\nNaturally, as you will see in every mock draft, Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza went No. 1 overall to the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nMcNeil-Warren is 6’2″ and 202 pounds with 4.5 speed. He’s got the size. The Toledo Rocket is known for forcing turnovers, which the Vikings could obviously use in 2026 and beyond. He also has the length, burst, and ability worthy of the 1st Round, though general managers often don’t consider safeties as premium assets, like cornerbacks.\n\nNFL Draft Buzz on McNeil-Warren: “His combination of length, improving instincts, and proven ability to generate game-changing plays positions him as the type of safety who could thrive in a role-specific capacity early before expanding his responsibilities.”\n\n“The modern NFL’s emphasis on versatile defensive backs who can match up with tight ends and provide run support from depth aligns perfectly with his skill set, though defensive coordinators will need patience developing his deep coverage reliability. His ceiling depends heavily on continued refinement of his anticipation and pattern recognition – the mental processing that separates good college safeties from NFL starters.”\n\nAnother Toledo defensive back took off after being drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2024: cornerback Quinyon Mitchell.\n\nNBD added on McNeill-Warren, “The flashes are there, particularly his pick-six against Western Kentucky that demonstrated his growth reading quarterback intentions, but consistency remains elusive. Teams running primarily split-safety coverages where he can work from depth and leverage his closing speed downhill would maximize his immediate impact while minimizing exposure to his weaknesses in isolated deep coverage situations.”\n\n“While he may never become an elite single-high free safety, McNeil-Warren possesses the tools and competitive drive to carve out a decade-long career as a valuable chess piece in creative defensive schemes that value versatility and playmaking over pure coverage ability.”\n\nThe Job Lewis Cine Should’ve Filled\n\nIt’s worth noting that the Vikings shouldn’t need safety right now. The here and now was supposed to be the time that 2022 1st-Rounder Lewis Cine entered his prime. But after Cine broke his leg as a rookie and never gained his footing in the defense thereafter, Minnesota dropped Cine a couple of offseasons ago, one of the worst busts in Vikings history.\n\nCine now plays in the UFL, along with high-round 2022 draft mate, cornerback Andrew Booth.\n\nHad general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah hit on Cine, he would not have to entertain a high-round draft pick on a safety like McNeill-Warren. That’s why draft busts are so impactful and damning.\n\nNot So Fast on Smith’s Retirement?\n\nMinnesota extended defensive coordinator Brian Flores’s contract last week, nominating him for a return in 2026. And while fans had a going-away party for Harrison Smith a few weeks ago in Week 18, a source told VikingsTerritory last weekend that Smith’s retirement is not a foregone conclusion. The 36-year-old has a “hard time walking away,” per the source, and Flores’s renewal with the Vikings could lure Smith back for Year No. 15.\n\nIf that happens, the Vikings would still need an eventual Smith replacement, but it may not be in the 1st Round of the NFL draft. The team would basically buy itself another year.\n\nFinal note: safeties are usually pretty easy to find in free agency. If Minnesota doesn’t prefer the draft for a safety, about 10 startable options will be available on the open market in March. Players like Kamren Curl (Los Angeles Rams) and Jalen Thompson (Arizona Cardinals) will be available in six weeks if their current teams don’t renew their contracts.",

    "description": "The San Francisco 49ers went heavy on their top needs in a three-round 2026 NFL mock draft from the Draft Wire.",
    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers have a host of needs to address in the 2026 NFL draft as they continue piecing together an on-the-fly roster transition they hope helps them avoid a full-blown rebuild.\n\nA key piece of their success in that quest will be finding high-level talent via the draft. Free agency will cover some of their roster holes, but the draft is where long-term, sustainable success is found. That's why their trio of selections in a three-round projection from our friends at the Draft Wire make a ton of sense, even if they don't tackle some of the team's most immediate needs.\n\nHere's a quick look at their three picks:\n\nThe skinny: Concepcion hauled in 16 touchdowns across two seasons at North Carolina State, including a whopping 10 as a freshman. His numbers dipped some in his second season before transferring to Texas A&M where he found immediate success in the SEC. Last year he hauled in 61 receptions for 919 yards and nine touchdowns. Perhaps the most intriguing part of Concepcion's game is what he can do with the ball in his hands. He racked up 431 yards and three touchdowns on 70 carries in his college career. Concepcion also added punt return duties last season where he tallied a pair of touchdowns on 25 returns.\n\nThe skinny: McNeil-Warren would be a really interesting addition for an evolving 49ers defense. His size is evident on film and his production across four years at Toledo is strong. In 48 games he racked up 214 tackles with 11 tackles for loss, five interceptions, 17 pass breakups and nine forced fumbles. His length and athleticism would give San Francisco a new style of safety who can conceivably be a more dynamic option in the back end of their defense than either of the Ji'Ayir Brown-Malik Mustapha duo provides.\n\nThe skinny: There's a lot to like just looking at Josephs. His frame is leaner than his 6-3, 240-pound listing would suggest and he brings really good length that he uses to move blockers. His athleticism looks okay on tape, but he looks a little stiff coming off the edge which may be part of the reason he's a third-round projection this early in the draft process. Josephs spent four years at Tennessee and posted 104 tackles, 22 tackles for loss and 9.5 sacks. Josephs also notched four pass breakups and six forced fumbles. More depth on the edge should be a priority in this draft for the 49ers and Josephs has a lot of desirable tools.\n\nMore 49ers: Should the 49ers re-sign DL Yetur Gross-Matos in free agency?\n\nThis article originally appeared on Niners Wire: 2026 NFL draft: 49ers pick KC Concepcion, 2 others in 3-round mock",

    "fullText": "As the 2026 season approaches, several NFL teams remain in search of the right leader to guide their next chapter. These openings reflect franchises at different crossroads, whether rebuilding, retooling, or trying to push a talented roster over the top. The decisions made in the coming weeks will shape not only next season, but the long-term direction of each organization.\n\nArizona’s opening represents a chance to fully reset the organization’s direction. The roster has young talent but lacks consistency and identity, making this a pivotal hire. The Cardinals must decide whether to prioritize offensive innovation or cultural rebuilding. Their next coach will likely be tasked with long-term development rather than immediate contention.\n\nThe Bills’ vacancy is one of the most attractive jobs on the market due to a strong core and established expectations. However, the pressure to win immediately will narrow the candidate pool. Buffalo needs a leader who can manage high expectations while refining late-game execution. The next coach will be judged quickly by postseason results.\n\nCleveland’s search reflects ongoing instability at the top despite roster talent. The Browns need a coach who can unify the locker room and bring clarity to both sides of the ball. Consistency and leadership will matter as much as schematic prowess. This hire could define the franchise’s direction for years.\n\nThe Raiders continue searching for a coach who can stabilize a franchise defined by constant change. Las Vegas needs a strong cultural leader capable of commanding respect in a demanding market. Identity, discipline, and accountability are key priorities. The next hire must balance star power with structure.\n\nFor teams still searching, patience and clarity will be just as important as splash or star power. The right hire can stabilize a franchise and establish an identity, while the wrong one can set progress back years. How these teams finish the coaching carousel may ultimately define the balance of the league heading into 2026.\n\nThe post NFL: Teams still looking for new head coaches appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "It doesn't seem possible, but it was actually 34 years ago on Monday.\n\nThat's right, I remember it so well. It was January 26, 1992, in Super Bowl XXVI, and Washington jumped out to a 17-0 halftime lead over the Buffalo Bills. On the Bills' first second-half possession, linebacker Kurt Gouveia intercepted a Jim Kelly pass, nearly returning it for a touchdown. Gerald Riggs hammered the ball into the end zone, and it was 24-0 Redskins.\n\nREDEMPTION!\nJanuary 26, 1992\n\nFour years after \"The Fumble\" in the AFC Championship with the #Browns in Denver, running back Earnest Byner scores the first touchdown of Super Bowl XXVI en route to the Redskins' third Super Bowl title.#HTTR #RaiseHail pic.twitter.com/FWP0mbSpwV\n\n— Kevin Gallagher (@KevG163) January 26, 2026\n\nEarly in the final quarter, Mark Rypien, Earnest Byner, the Hogs, and the Posse (Art Monk, Gary Clark, Ricky Sanders), Charles Mann, Wilber Marshall, Darrell Green, and the rest of the Redskins were destroying the AFC Champion Bills 37-10. The game's final several minutes were anticlimactic, much less intense, with cameras showing Redskins on the sidelines laughing and enjoying themselves on their way to another Super Bowl championship, as the Bills scored two late scores for a 37-24 final.\n\nIt was Joe Jackson Gibbs' fourth Super Bowl with Washington and the third he had won. He had amazingly won those three Super Bowls with three different starting quarterbacks who were not Hall of Fame quarterbacks (Joe Theismann, Doug Williams, Mark Rypien). He also won with three different starting running backs (John Riggins, Timmy Smith, Earnest Byner). OT Joe Jacoby, C Jeff Bostic, WR Art Monk, TE Don Warren, G Russ Grimm and LB Monte Coleman played on all four of those Gibbs teams.\n\nSince that time Washington head coaches have been Richie Petitbon, Norv Turner, Terry Robiskie, Marty Schottenheimer, Steve Spurrier, Joe Gibbs again (2004-2007), Jim Zorn, Mike Shanahan, Jay Gruden, Bill Callahan, Ron Rivera, and Dan Quinn.\n\nYes, a lot has changed for Washington in the last 34 years, sadly, even the name.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: 34 years ago was franchise's last Super Bowl",

    "fullText": "It’s probably been a while since you’ve heard the name Bob Quinn, but the former Detroit Lions general manager is back in the news.\n\nAfter the Lions parted ways with Quinn in the middle of the 2020 season, he eventually joined the Cleveland Browns as a senior consultant. The next year, he was promoted to senior personnel/coaching executive, allowing him to work on both the coaching and team personnel side of the business.\n\nBut with the Browns’ latest regime dissolved in the midst of a new head coaching search, Quinn is leaving the organization and following former Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski to the Atlanta Falcons. His new role appears to be solely on the coaching side, as his title is senior advisor to the head coach.\n\nIt’s an interesting career arc for Quinn, who had worked solely on the personnel side of the business when he joined the Lions in 2016. He rose up the ranks in the New England Patriots’ scouting department for 15 years before landing the general manager job with the Lions. His time in Detroit was very mixed. On one hand, he made some impressive picks along the offensive line (Taylor Decker, Graham Glasgow, Frank Ragnow). On the other hand, he’ll always be haunted by the picks of Jarrad Davis, Teez Tabor, Jahlani Tavai, and Jeff Okudah. What ultimately sank his career the most was the decision to hire Matt Patricia as the team’s head coach—a disaster that set the franchise back several years.\n\nBut it speaks volumes that Stefanski—a two-time AP NFL Coach of the Year—trusts Quinn as his right-hand man on the coaching side of football.

    "fullText": "Colorado football coach Deion Sanders has laid out an NFL-style system of fines for his players if they violate team rules, including $500 for being late to practice.\n\nHe showed it on the video screen in his first team meeting of 2026 on Jan. 23, as briefly seen in a video posted by his oldest son, Deion Jr. Here is what it said:\n\nLate to meeting or film session: $400\n\nNo-show to meeting or film session: $2,000\n\nLate to strength and conditioning workout: $1,000\n\nNo-show to strength and conditioning workout: $1,500\n\nViolation of team rules: $1,000-$2,500 based on severity.\n\nPublic or social media misconduct: $2,000-$5,000\n\nDamage to university or team property: repair cost +$3,000\n\nLoss of team technology or equipment: replacement cost +$1,000\n\nPlayers also are required to wear Nike shoes and apparel while representing the university at practices, games and organized team activities. Colorado has been a Nike-sponsored school since 1995. Sanders also is sponsored by Nike. Failure to comply also could result in disciplinary action.\n\nThere is an appeal process for players, with final decisions issued within five business days. But it's another example of the professionalization of college sports, with players this year getting paid directly by schools for use of their name, image and likeness (NIL).\n\nA lack of discipline also apparently was an issue for Colorado last year, when the Buffaloes finished 3-9 during Sanders’ third season in charge.\n\n“All these lates and tardies and all these things, we can’t have that this year,” Colorado receivers coach Jason Phillips told the team. “Those are the things we will eliminate… Two ways to eliminate that. Either you change, or we change you.”\n\nSanders has brought in 42 new scholarship transfer players this year, offsetting more than 35 scholarship players who transferred out.\n\n“You all are hand-picked, hand-picked, hand-picked,” Sanders told the team. “We watched darn near every one of y’all.”\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

Today, let’s discuss some players who have improved their stock since it got cold, be it with late-December rallies or impressive showings in the postseason.\n\nGive Mike Vrabel credit for not mothballing Stevenson after some early-season fumbling issues. The Patriots hitched up to Stevenson in the playoffs, giving him 45 touches the last two weeks, including 25 in the AFC Championship win over the Broncos. He currently has 194 rushing yards for the playoffs, tops in the NFL.\n\nMeanwhile, TreVeyon Henderson saw just three opportunities (three forgettable runs) in the victory at Denver. Henderson was the home-run hitter in this backfield most of the year, with Stevenson the steady grinder; come playoff time, the Pats have leaned into the grinder. And Stevenson was trusted much \n\nFigure on Stevenson getting a bell cow workload in the Super Bowl, and earning the higher ADP in next summer’s draft season.\n\nEveryone remembers his “hello world” moment, the 6-118-2 detonation at Cincinnati, including the game-winning touchdown. But the Bears didn’t completely hand Loveland the keys to the kingdom until after Christmas. He absorbed 48 targets over his final four games (including the playoffs), good for a 28-378-2 log.\n\nThis is going to push Loveland into pricy areas for next year’s fantasy drafts, but I’m here for it. Caleb Williams is also on the escalator and Ben Johnson is the right man with the play sheet.\n\nSean McVay usually employs a very narrow offense for fantasy purposes, relying on just a handful of skill players. But that tree expanded during the 2025 season, with Corum starting to become a proactive complement to starting RB Kyren Williams. Corum was the team’s most effective back in Sunday’s loss at Seattle (12 touches, 79 scrimmage yards), and he received double-digit touches in six of his final eight games. Corum also had six touchdowns on the year, with five of them coming after Thanksgiving.\n\nThe Rams haven’t soured on Williams and he’ll be the clear starter entering 2026. But Corum probably has 8-12 touch equity in any game where he’s healthy, and he’ll shoot past that projection every now and then, if the Rams want to steer into a hot hand. Corum is on the flex radar for 2026 fantasy planning, and he’s just one injury away from being a needle mover, too.\n\nI don’t know how to quit this guy. Mims was an afterthought for most of the year but he was forced into action during the playoffs, coming through with a nifty 12-155-1 line on 14 targets. I get it, the Broncos have a crowded receiver room, and Troy Franklin and Pat Bryant are still ascending talents. But let’s not forget that Mims will only be 24 next year, too. Mims has already scored 11 regular-season touchdowns despite limited opportunities, and he’s dynamic as a kick returner. He’s screaming for a bigger role.\n\nJust making the NFL as an undrafted receiver out of Holy Cross is a big win for Coker, but he’s not content to stop there. He stepped forward in his final six starts, posting a 28-378-4 log, including that 134-yard explosion against the Rams. Coker has good size and the ability to high point the ball, which gives him the potential to score 8-10 touchdowns in a full season, even with Tetairoa McMillan already on the team. Coker will be a trendy fantasy sleeper next summer, but I’ll still try to get a seat near the front of that bandwagon.",

    "fullText": "After winning their respective conference championship games on Jan. 25, the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots punched their tickets to Super Bowl LX\n\nThe NFL championship game will take place on Feb. 8 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif.\n\nGreen Day, Charlie Puth and Bad Bunny will take the Super Bowl 2026 stage\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots are set to face off in football's biggest showdown.\n\nHeld on Feb. 8 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., the 2026 Super Bowl will not only crown this year's NFL champion but also mark 60 years since the first game was played. To commemorate the milestone, Green Day will deliver a special opening performance before the teams take center stage, ushering generations of Super Bowl MVPs onto the field.\n\n“Celebrating 60 years of Super Bowl history with Green Day as a hometown band, while honoring the NFL legends who’ve helped define this sport, is an incredibly powerful way to kick off Super Bowl LX,” Tim Tubito, the league’s senior director of event and game presentation, told the Associated Press in January 2026.\n\nThough fans are amped for the 2026 Super Bowl's musical stars — which also include Charlie Puth and Bad Bunny — the main act will be on the field.\n\nPatriots quarterback Drake Maye will lead the team back to the Super Bowl for the first time since 2019, giving the franchise a chance at its seventh title and its first without Tom Brady and Bill Belichick. On the other side, Seattle returns to the Super Bowl with Sam Darnold at the helm, looking to secure its second Lombardi Trophy after winning its first in 2014.\n\nHere's everything to know about the 2026 Super Bowl, including the full performance lineup.\n\nSuper Bowl LX is scheduled for Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026.\n\nThis year's NFL championship game will be held at Levi's Stadium, home to the San Francisco 49ers, in Santa Clara, Calif.\n\nWhile the Patriots' last Super Bowl appearance was a win in 2019, the Seahawks' last championship game was in 2015 — when they lost 28-24 against the Patriots. The Seahawks have previously made three total appearances in the Super Bowl — 2006, 2014 and 2015 — and won once, in 2014.\n\nMeanwhile, the Patriots have made 11 appearances in the Super Bowl — more than any other team — and won six games. If they win in February, they will have the most ever wins in Super Bowl history.\n\nWhile all six wins have previously taken place during Brady and Belichick's era, Maye emphasized the team’s fresh chapter after the Patriots beat the Denver Broncos 10-7 at the AFC Championship game on Jan. 25.\n\n“It’s a new team, it’s a new era,” he told Boston.com. “I respect and appreciate what the Patriots dynasty did, and unfortunately they didn’t come out with some wins here, but we changed that narrative and look forward to bringing our best football for [the Super Bowl].”\n\nIn September 2025, the NFL announced that Bad Bunny (born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio) would perform at the 2026 Super Bowl Halftime Show. The \"MONACO\" rapper shared his excitement about the honor in a statement at the time.\n\n“What I'm feeling goes beyond myself,\" he explained. \"It's for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown… this is for my people, my culture, and our history. Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL.”\n\nFans will also be treated to a lineup of killer performances before the game even starts. Green Day will kick off the events with an opening ceremony to \"welcome the MVPs who’ve shaped the game and open the night for fans all over the world,\" frontman Billie Joe Armstrong said in a statement.\n\nAfter that, Puth will sing the national anthem, followed by 11-time Grammy winner Brandi Carlile performing \"America the Beautiful.\" Coco Jones will also give a rendition of \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" to close out the pregame ceremony.\n\nAccording to the NFL, the 2026 Super Bowl kicks off at 6:30 p.m. ET / 3:30 p.m. PT. Green Day's opening ceremony performance will start airing a half-hour earlier at 6 p.m. ET / 3 p.m. PT.\n\nThose who aren't catching the game live in California can watch it broadcast on NBC and Telemundo, per the NFL. Fans can also tune in on the NFL app or stream the game on Peacock.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFor a few years, there existed a conspiracy theory that the colors of the Super Bowl logo predicted which two teams would play for the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nWell, that one is out, and a new theory is in.\n\nSome NFL fans believe a preseason graphic the league posted to its social media accounts actually predicted the seemingly unpredictable Super Bowl 60 matchup between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks, two teams that hadn't won a playoff game since 2019 before this season.\n\nHere's a look at the graphic behind the NFL's newest \"script writer\" conspiracy theory.\n\nMORE:Super Bowl 60 odds, spread as Seahawks open as favorites\n\nAfter the Patriots and Seahawks punched their ticket to the Super Bowl, fans started to notice which two quarterbacks seem to be closer to the giant Lombardi Trophy than the rest in this graphic posted by the NFL on the first day of the regular season:\n\n— RedditCFB (@RedditCFB) January 26, 2026\n\nA closer inspection reveals you can make the case Baker Mayfield was actually closer than Darnold, or that Travis Hunter seems to be the closest to the trophy.\n\nThis is no time for facts, though. NFL fans have unearthed the latest grand Super Bowl conspiracy, and it's true that Maye and Darnold were both front and center in relation to the Lombardi Trophy in the graphic just as they are in reality today.\n\n\"They really gave us the script in September,\" the lead Drake Maye fan account tweeted Sunday night.\n\nThey really gave us the script in September https://t.co/ofeVgBdbPb\n\n— Drake Maye Lover (@drakemayeloverr) January 26, 2026\n\nAnother look at the graphic reveals the NFL probably believed a Patriots-Seahawks Super Bowl was enormously unlikely. The sport's biggest names are front-and-center, from Saquon Barkley and Patrick Mahomes to Brock Purdy and Joe Burrow. Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen are also closer to Mahomes and Barkley than they are to Maye and Darnold in the distance.\n\nConsidering players from the Jacksonville Jaguars, New York Giants and Tennessee Titans are standing nearly shoulder-to-shoulder with Maye and Darnold in the distance, it seems more like the league discounted the Patriots and Seahawks than predicted their Super Bowl 60 meeting.\n\nWhy let the finer details get in the way of a good conspiracy theory, though?\n\nSeahawks take down Rams to advance to Super Bowl 60\n\nSam Darnold, Jaxon Smith-Njigba star for Seahawks in NFC championship\n\nRams' special teams blunders continue in NFC championship\n\nSeahawks Pope trend continues with Super Bowl 60 berth",

    "description": "Once the No. 3 overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, Sam Darnold’s career seemed destined to be remembered as a cautionary tale.",
    "fullText": "Once the No. 3 overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, Sam Darnold’s career seemed destined to be remembered as a cautionary tale. He was labeled a bust with the New York Jets, flamed out in Carolina, faded into the background in San Francisco, and was ultimately discarded by the Minnesota Vikings. Eight seasons later, that narrative is officially dead.\n\nOn Sunday night, Darnold delivered the defining performance of his career, throwing for 346 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Seattle Seahawks to a 31–27 win over the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship Game. The victory sends Seattle to Super Bowl LX. And sends Darnold’s critics scrambling.\n\n“I mean, he just shut a lot of people up tonight,” Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald said after the game. “So I’m really happy for him.”\n\nDarnold was sensational from start to finish, matching throws with MVP candidate Matthew Stafford on the game’s biggest stage. He connected with Jaxon Smith-Njigba for a momentum-swinging touchdown with 20 seconds left in the first half, flipping the game in Seattle’s favor.\n\nFollowing a disastrous Rams special teams mistake, Darnold capitalized by firing a strike to Jake Bobo over the middle for another score. Later, he ripped a perfectly placed spiral through Los Angeles’ zone coverage to Cooper Kupp for a 13-yard touchdown, the play that ultimately proved decisive.\n\nThe performance was a masterclass in poise and precision. Darnold finished 25-of-36 passing with zero interceptions, repeatedly delivering when the moment demanded it most.\n\nSeattle complemented Darnold’s brilliance with timely defense and game-changing special teams. Devon Witherspoon made back-to-back pass breakups inside the six-yard line late in the fourth quarter, forcing a turnover on downs that kept the Rams off the scoreboard.\n\nOn special teams, the Seahawks forced two muffed punts from Rams returner Xavier Smith, recovering the second to set up Darnold’s touchdown pass to Bobo.\n\n“It’s a team win,” Macdonald said. “And then, you can’t talk about the game without talking about our quarterback.”\n\nFor Darnold, this marks his first NFC Championship win as a starter. He previously earned a conference title as a backup with the 49ers during their Super Bowl run two years ago, but this one was different — this one was his.\n\nAfter five teams, nearly 3,000 pass attempts, and almost eight full seasons in the league, Darnold has become the first quarterback from the vaunted 2018 draft class, which included Baker Mayfield and MVPs Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson, to win a conference championship as a starter.\n\nWhen his best was required, Sam Darnold delivered it. Two weeks from now in Santa Clara, he’ll have a chance to put the final stamp on a career resurrection that once seemed impossible.\n\nThe post Seahawks News: Mike Macdonald Says Sam Darnold “Shut a Lot of People Up” With 3-TD Game vs. Rams appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "As the NFL makes more and more officiating misses subject to replay review, the lingering blind spots become more and more glaring.\n\nIt's time (in fact, it's long overdue) for missed facemask fouls to be called via replay.\n\nThere's no reason not to do it. Replay currently can be used to undo an erroneous facemask call. Why shouldn't it be used when a clear and obvious foul was missed?\n\nIt happened during the second quarter of Sunday's NFC Championship, when Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford had his facemask grabbed on a third-down sack that forced a field goal. If the penalty hadn't been missed, the Rams would have gotten 15 yards and a fresh set of downs.\n\nSome would say the NFL resists using replay to put a flag on the field. From its inception, however, the current replay rules have allowed a penalty to be called for having too many men on the field.\n\nToday, too many things are reviewable to justify omitting something that requires no subjectivity. And it's eventually going to affect a huge game, in a huge spot.\n\nIt affected today's huge NFC Championship, ending a potential touchdown drive that could have tied the game at 10 and forcing the Rams to settle for three.

Let's dive into exactly how before the final two pre-Super Bowl games get going.\n\nBoth teams get at least one possession in overtime, a rule change made after the controversial 2022 AFC Championship game. The Buffalo Bills lost that one to the Kansas City Chiefs after failing to get a possession in overtime, as you might recall.\n\nA playoff game also cannot end in a tie, so if the score is even after the first overtime period, the teams will play as many are needed for a winner to emerge. Between each overtime period a two-minute intermission will take place. Additionally, the second and fourth overtime periods are subject to the same timing rules as the second and fourth regulation periods.\n\nLike the regular season, overtime will not feature any instant replay coach's challenges as all reviews are initiated by the replay official.\n\nNo playoff games went to overtime last season, so perhaps we're due for some this year. There's nothing better than some extra football, especially in the playoffs.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Overtime rules for NFL playoffs in NFC, AFC conference championships",

    "fullText": "It’s a scary thought for the NFL that Drake Maye hasn’t necessarily reached his full potential.\n\nMaye can conclude his second season with a Super Bowl appearance if the New England Patriots defeat the Denver Broncos on Sunday. The 23-year-old quarterback is also an MVP finalist after completing 72 percent of his passes for 4,394 yards and 31 touchdowns.\n\nCapturing a Lombardi Trophy could help establish Maye as one of the league’s premier signal-callers. When asked how good he could become during CBS’s pre-game coverage of the AFC Championship Game, former Pro Bowl offensive lineman Kyle Long declared that the sky is the limit.\n\n“There is no ceiling,” Long said. “From a physical standpoint, from a personality standpoint, from a toughness standpoint, he checks all the boxes.”\n\nMaye endured an uneven rookie campaign for the 4-13 Patriots, but they’ve reversed that record behind an improved roster. Long celebrated Maye’s maturation alongside a bolstered supporting cast and praised the North Carolina native’s humility.\n\n“He’s proved it all season long,” Long added. “He’s unbelievably accurate, but I think the thing that stands out the most … his personality. He’s got an ‘Aw shucks’ about him.”\n\nMaye has been far from perfect this postseason, losing three of six fumbles and throwing an interception in each game. However, he also averaged 9.2 yards per pass attempt in a 16-3 win over the Los Angeles Chargers and tossed three touchdowns against the Houston Texans’ No. 1-ranked defense in the AFC Divisional Round.\n\nSurviving another stout Broncos defense could help Maye quickly stamp his place in Patriots lore and continue his ascension to superstardom.\n\nHow Patriots Would Make NFL History With AFC Championship Game Win Vs.

    "description": "Those familiar with the pair have told Yahoo Sports in recent months that the rekindled admiration is real. But burying the hatchet in the NFL guarantees nothing.",
    "fullText": "Heading into Week 18, Aaron Rodgers was nothing if not pragmatically optimistic.\n\nThe days on his Pittsburgh Steelers contract were dwindling. The future of head coach Mike Tomlin was a subject of public debate. And the franchise he quarterbacked was cornered into a de facto playoff game against the Baltimore Ravens in the regular-season finale. Any direction you looked, there was something finite hanging in the balance. But in what registered in at least a mild surprise, Rodgers spoke to reporters like a man who didn’t see a definitive near-term conclusion to his football career … so long as he didn’t want it to end.\n\n“I’m thinking about this week, but obviously I’m 42 years old and I’m on a one-year deal, so you know what the situation is,” Rodgers told reporters. “Whenever the season ends, I’ll be a free agent. So that’ll give me a lot of options if I still want to play.”\n\nRodgers gave a slight shrug and chuckled.\n\n“Not a lot of options, but — there will be options I would think. Maybe one or two if I decide I still want to play.”\n\n[Get more Steelers news: Pittsburgh team feed]\n\nHe then punctuated the thought by opening the door to a return.\n\n“I’ve enjoyed this experience,” Rodgers said. “Everybody in Pittsburgh has been fantastic to me on and off the field. It’s really what I was hoping for, for this experience. It’s been even better than I was hoping.”\n\nA few days later, the Steelers would beat the Ravens and make the postseason, before getting bounced in the first round of the playoffs against the Houston Texans. All in all, it culminated in a season that felt like Rodgers, Tomlin and the Steelers squeezed about as much as they could have expected.\n\nThen Tomlin left, via a resignation that felt like a surprise to ownership. And maybe to Rodgers, too, given that any thought of his return seemed so strongly bound to whether Tomlin would continue to guide Pittsburgh. When that changed, logical speculation — and that’s all we’ve been left with thus far on the Rodgers front — was that a new head coach would mean a new quarterback. Whatever options were on the table for Rodgers, they appeared to have shrunk by one.\n\nThen came Saturday, when the Steelers went against their historical hiring template and locked in 62-year-old Mike McCarthy, a candidate who can fit more than one forward-looking ideology.  On one hand, McCarthy is a seasoned veteran coach who can come in and try to energize an aging roster that is still very much built to win now. On the other, he could be tasked with developing the franchise’s next young quarterback. Without a bridge starter currently on the roster, it will be difficult for McCarthy to achieve both of those responsibilities.\n\nUnless, of course, McCarthy can find a veteran who knows his system and can come in and help with both tasks. Maybe a quarterback who McCarthy previously helped develop into a star? One who already has spent a season in the Pittsburgh quarterback room with 24-year-old Will Howard, who showed promise in limited reps during his rookie preseason and has the support of the front office as a prospect worth some continued development?\n\nThat sounds like a fit for Rodgers. And perhaps the renewal of a 2026 option that appeared to be extinguished when Tomlin resigned.\n\nOf course, that doesn’t mean McCarthy was hired with any kind of specificity of luring Rodgers back for another season. While some of Pittsburgh’s players gave Rodgers high marks as a teammate in their exit interviews, the work to find the next long-term starting option is clearly near the top of the priorities for ownership and general manager Omar Khan. And that wouldn’t have changed even if Tomlin had remained. One way or another, 2026 was always going to be geared toward either figuring out if the next young quarterback is already on the roster (in the form of Howard) or if the Steelers liked any of their draft, trade or free-agency options.\n\nMcCarthy’s arrival won’t change that mindset. The real factors of change at the quarterback spot will instead be pressed against the options Pittsburgh has available. If McCarthy is a head coach Rodgers will play for, it gives Pittsburgh at least one more year of a bridge starter to either weigh Howard as a prospect, or find someone in the 2026 draft who is worthy of being selected and then groomed. And there’s certainly some deep-value intrigue over the coming draft class of quarterbacks.\n\nThe Steelers won’t have a shot at Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza and their first-round draft pick at No. 21 overall might not be high enough to land Alabama’s Ty Simpson, either. But after that tandem, there are some interesting quarterbacks who could be seen as worthwhile projects with upside. Mississippi’s Trinidad Chambliss (if he can’t force another year of NCAA eligibility) will draw a significant amount of study from NFL teams. As will a quartet of others who were previously considered to be first-round picks — and potentially very high first-round picks — until hitting stumbles in their final seasons: LSU’s Garrett Nussmeier, Miami’s Carson Beck, Penn State’s Drew Allar and Clemson’s Cade Klubnik, among others.\n\nFor now — and we’ve yet to go through the draft sifting process, so take this with a grain of salt — only Mendoza cuts the figure as a Day 1 rookie starter. Simpson could round into that kind of prospect, or one who has a shot to earn a starting job during his rookie season. The rest? Most personnel opinions appear to be placing them on a developmental track to possibly get a shot with a year or more of work from further down the depth chart.\n\nIf any of those players are in the Steelers’ future, McCarthy’s hiring makes a lot of sense given his history with helping quarterbacks grow into starters. And it also makes sense that Rodgers would be a fit, so long as he continues to be in a year-to-year contract mindset and actually wants to play for McCarthy again.\n\nIn that latter vein, both McCarthy and Rodgers have said very nice things about each other in the least few years, each gaining the perspective of working with new people and in new places. Those familiar with the pair have told Yahoo Sports in recent months that the rekindled admiration is real, with both having come to terms with their own mistakes and frustrations that ultimately played a part in McCarthy getting fired late in the 2018 season after coaching the Green Bay Packers for nearly 13 years.\n\nBut burying the hatchet in the NFL guarantees nothing. Even if Rodgers wants to play again and McCarthy would like to have him in 2026, the veteran quarterback doesn’t know what the rest of the league landscape will look like in even a few weeks. There’s a chance the Los Angeles Rams win a Super Bowl and Matthew Stafford decides to pull a John Elway and retire. Should that happen, the Rams will still be very much in the middle of a Super Bowl window and not have an obvious starting quarterback on the roster. And then there is the Minnesota Vikings, a team Rodgers was very interested in playing for last offseason. They are looking for someone to come in and compete with J.J. McCarthy for the starting job next season.\n\nAdd the Steelers to that mix, and you have exactly what Rodgers was talking about when he focused his gaze on 2026. Not a lot of options — but certainly some interesting ones.",

    "description": "Sam Darnold can make USC history. Other Trojans will play huge roles as they all try to make the Super Bowl",
    "fullText": "We are one week closer to the conclusion of the NFL playoffs. This weekend will determine which two teams will make it to the Super Bowl. In both games, the former USC Trojans will play a huge factor and have their fingerprints all over games with the Super Bowl up for grabs. Sam Darnold not only has his legacy on the line, but also a chance to represent his alma mater for the first time on the NFL's biggest stage.\n\nHere are my predictions for championship weekend in the NFL:\n\nSam Darnold and the Seahawks will enter the biggest game in recent memory for the former NFC juggernaut. This time around, they enter with a defense similar to the Legion of Boom but an offense that is more well-rounded. Seattle has looked miles ahead of the other playoff teams left. I think the Rams will give them a challenge and this game will come down to the last drive, but Seattle has proven themselves to be the better team between the two teams in this matchup. They can blowout teams, they can win close, low-score games, and they can win shootouts. I think this game, Sam Darnold, and the Seahawks offense will have to be at its best, but I think Darnold will deliver the best quarterback performance in this matchup. Seattle will move on and represent the NFC in the Super Bowl.\n\nMany might gift wrap this win to the Patriots with Bo Nix being out for the rest of the season, but I disagree. I think the Patriots come out on top, but they will have to work for this game. The Broncos' defense will need former USC Trojan Talanoa Hufanga to fly around and make plays all day. The Patriots' offense has struggled to keep Drake Maye upright in each of their playoff games. Maye has been sacked 5 times. That is where the Broncos' defense specializes. Their defensive line can get after their quarterback like no other. The Broncos' defense will keep them in this game; it will come down to whether or not he can put together his best Nick Foles impression. I think he will play well, but not well enough to win this football game. I think he will come up short late and throw a costly interception, and Drake Maye and Mike Vrabel will iron out this victory in a low-scoring defensive battle.\n\nI think Sam Darnold saves his biggest performance for the game right before the Super Bowl. Darnold squeaked by Stafford and the Rams in the last meeting between the two teams in an overtime win. Darnold will have to play exactly like he did down the stretch in that game to get the victory in this one. I think Darnold reaches 300 yards through the air, and he and Jaxon Smith-Njigba light up the Rams' secondary. This secondary has given up their fair share of big games to their opponent. This game will be no different. Jaxon Smith-Njigba will have over 100 yards receiving, and he will connect with Sam Darnold for two touchdowns in this game. I think Darnold and Jaxon Smith-Njigba have the two biggest performances in the NFC Championship game.\n\nIn the AFC, I think pass rusher Nik Bonitto has the most dominant performance. The Patriots have given up 5 sacks in each of their playoff games. In the last game versus the Texans, Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson Jr. combined for 5 sacks. Bonitto this season had 14 sacks. I think he will have 3 sacks in this game and disrupt Drake Maye all game long.\n\nI think defensive tackle Milton Williams will also have himself a big game and disrupt the Broncos on the other end. Williams has been a huge reason for the Patriots' defensive turnaround, and he was great all regular season long. He creates pressure from the interior with the best of them, and he is a great run stopper. I think he will lead this Patriots defensive line to make the Broncos one-dimensional and take out their run game. Williams will also lead the Patriots in sacks with two. Verus the Chargers, Williams had two sacks, and against the Texans, he was an irritant all game long, forcing the pick 6 that took the momentum away from Houston initially. I think Milton Williams will use all of that to have his best playoff game with the Patriots and help send his team to the Super Bowl.\n\nMy Super Bowl matchup prediction is the New England Patriots taking on the Seattle Seahawks. The Patriots have had quite the Super Bowl run vs tough defenses, but they still will not be prepared for the Seahawks' defense. Mike Macdonald and the Seahawks defense will make it a tough day for young star quarterback Drake Maye. I think his age and inexperience will come back to bite him in this match. I think Rashid Shaheed will pay homage to Devin Hester and take the opening kickoff back for a touchdown, setting the tone for the entire game. I think Darnold will not have to do much to be the top quarterback on the field, but he still will put up a respectable performance. Seattle will play their last complete performance of the season, getting their Super Bowl victory. Darnold will look to be greedy and not just settle for being the first Trojan quarterback to start in the Super Bowl, but he will also become the first Trojan quarterback to win a Super Bowl.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: Predictions for USC on championship weekend in NFL playoffs",

    "fullText": "Jarrett Stidham chose to remain with the Denver Broncos last offseason.\n\nWith his initial two-year deal set to expire last March, Stidham drew interest from other NFL teams — including the New England Patriots — but he opted to re-sign with the Broncos on another two-year contract.\n\nTen months later, Stidham is set to start for Denver against New England in the AFC Championship game on Sunday following Bo Nix's season-ending ankle injury. After practice on Wednesday, Stidham was asked about his decision to re-sign with the Broncos in 2025.\n\n“There are always opportunities out there and stuff, but I think at the end of the day, there was a combination of things that went into my decision to come back here,\" Stidham said. \"I believe in Sean [Payton], and Davis [Webb] and Joe [Lombardi], and our room, and being behind Bo and helping him grow. I take a lot of pride in that.\n\n\"I felt like, over the last two years that I was here, that I got a lot better. I think the way Davis has coached us over these last three years now has really helped all of us improve. That’s just one thing I wanted to come back and be a part of. I felt like being here the last two years, and coming in with Sean, and signing and everything, it’s pretty evident that he has the train rolling in the right direction. I don’t think anybody can argue that, and I wanted to be a part of it.”\n\nStidham was one of Payton's first free agent signings when the coach arrived in 2023, and Payton has made it clear that he has faith in Stidham. After three years in a backup role, Stidham now gets an opportunity to step up and make history. Sunday's game (1:00 p.m. MT) will be nationally televised on CBS (more TV info).\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL: Jarrett Stidham explains why he re-signed with Broncos in 2025",

    "title": "Fact Check: Don't fall for rumor Jalen Hurts established Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund",
    "description": "According to the rumor, the NFL's 2025 Super Bowl MVP donated $300,000 of his own money as a way of kick-starting the special fund.",
    "fullText": "Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts established the Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund — in honor of the woman fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis in January 2026 —and contributed $300,000.\n\nIn January 2026, online users shared a rumor claiming Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts established the Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund. Users' posts claimed the NFL's Super Bowl LIX MVP kickstarted the fund himself, contributing $300,000 of his own money.\n\nThe purported scholarship fund referenced Renee Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident shot fatally shot on Jan. 7 by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross.\n\nFor example, on Jan. 20, a user managing the NFL Pulse Facebook page posted (archived) an image collage of three pictures allegedly showing Hurts hugging Good's 6-year-old son on a football field, Good holding her son in front of a body of water and Hurts walking inside a football stadium. The post's text claimed Good's killing inspired Hurts to launch the Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund, including the $300,000 contribution.\n\nIn short, the rumor was false. One or more users fabricated and promoted the claim with the help of images and text generated with artificial-intelligence tools.\n\nSnopes contacted a manager of the NFL Pulse Facebook page to ask about the fictional stories and AI-generated content displayed on the feed, as well as the Philadelphia Eagles to request an official statement, and will update this story if we receive more information.\n\nThe NFL Pulse Facebook post (archived) — as well as other Facebook posts sharing the same rumor — featured links leading to advertisement-filled articles hosted on WordPress blogs. The users owning those blogs earned revenue based on the combination of advertising and made-up stories. The NFL Pulse post redirected to an article on on such untrustworthy website.\n\nSearches of Bing, DuckDuckGo and Google found no news media outlets reporting about Hurts establishing a scholarship fund in Good's name. A Yahoo search did, however, mistakenly produce an AI-generated answer wrongly confirming the rumor as true. Outlets would have widely reported on the story involving Hurts and Good, had it truly occurred.\n\nRegarding the fake, AI-generated photo of Hurts holding Good's son, the most evident sign of AI — aside from the misspelling of \"Eagles\" as \"Eaglees\" — was the reality that sports and standard news outlets would have very widely publicized the moment, had the meeting between the quarterback and young boy truly taken place.\n\nThe NFL Pulse Facebook post's text, presented in its entirety later in this article, featured over-dramatic wording common with AI tools. For example, one part of the post read, \"This was not charity for attention. It was an act of remembrance, of dignity, and of deep human empathy — a reminder that even in the aftermath of violence and loss, compassion can still speak louder than silence.\" Additionally, the idea that individuals or teams aiming to rapidly produce inauthentic content for ad revenue would carefully, slowly and manually write text for their articles simply does not square with reality.\n\nThe person or people who authored the story about Hurts and Good fabricated the entire claim as one of hundreds of inspirational tales that depicted celebrities and athletes performing inspiring acts of kindness. Such stories resemble glurge, which Dictionary.com defines as stories \"that are supposed to be true and uplifting, but which are often fabricated and sentimental.\"\n\nFor readers interested in the story told in the NFL Pulse Facebook post, the post presented the made-up tale as follows:\n\nJalen Hurts has officially established The Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund, personally committing an initial $300,000 donation to honor the life of Renee Nicole Good — a mother whose story ended in tragedy after she was killed in Minneapolis, a loss that left an entire community grieving.\n\nBut this gesture goes far beyond a financial contribution.\n\nJalen Hurts founded the scholarship fund himself to ensure that Renee's 6-year-old son will receive full educational support from elementary school through college — including tuition, books, tutoring, and opportunities for personal development. Alongside the financial commitment, Jalen also dedicated his voice, his platform, and his heart to a child now facing a world without his mother.\n\nThis was not charity for attention. It was an act of remembrance, of dignity, and of deep human empathy — a reminder that even in the aftermath of violence and loss, compassion can still speak louder than silence.\n\nAcross the nation, many were moved not by the amount of money pledged, but by the meaning behind Jalen's decision: a promise that Renee Nicole Good's life mattered, and that her son's future will be protected, supported, and filled with hope.\n\nFor further reading, we previously reported about the time tech billionaire Elon Musk deleted a post supporting the Eagles supporting the Eagles after they lost the 2023 Super Bowl LVII.\n\n\"GLURGE Definition & Meaning.\" Dictionary.com, https://www.dictionary.com/browse/glurge.\n\nHuberman, Bond, and David Emery. \"Snopestionary: What Does 'Glurge' Mean?\" Snopes, 21 Aug. 2021, https://www.snopes.com//articles/363643/what-does-glurge-mean/.",

    "description": "Detroit Lions LB Jack Campbell is the recipient of the 2025 Pro Butkus Award.",
    "fullText": "Detroit Lions linebacker Jack Campbell has been named the recipient of the 2025 Pro Butkus Award. The award, which is more known for the identical college honors, goes to the top linebacker in the NFL, as voted on by Butkus Award Selection Committee—a selection of 51 voters from all ranks of football, including NFL front office members, scouts, and coaches.\n\n“Jack Campbell embodies everything the Butkus Award represents,” the committee said in a statement (via Hawkeyesports.com). “His size, instincts and disciplined approach to the position allow him to control the middle of the field. He plays with authority, communicates at a high level, and consistently puts himself in position to make impactful plays. His rise this season reflects not just talent, but leadership and football character.”\n\nCampbell’s 2025 season was a breakout for the third-year linebacker. He was named First-Team All Pro after tallying 176 tackles, nine tackles for loss, 5.0 sacks, three forced fumbles, and two fumble recoveries.\n\n“He’s extremely valuable,” Lions coach Dan Campbell said in December. “Right now, first of all he leads the team in amount of reps that he’s played for a season. He’s taken more reps than anybody on this team. He plays on kickoff for us and he’s an asset on kickoff and then everything you see on defense. He doesn’t come off the field, he’s our bell cow, green dot. And he does—and the guy is smart and he’s instinctive and he is snap-to-whistle all-out, all the time, in practice too. And he doesn’t take plays off, he doesn’t take days off, he goes after the football, he’s a ball guy. So, he’s invaluable.”\n\nInterestingly, this is the second time Campbell has won the award. Back in 2022, he won the college version of the award after a standout year with the Iowa Hawkeyes. That season, Campbell posted 128 tackles, 5.5 tackles for loss, a forced fumble, and a fumble recovery.\n\nCampbell is heading into the fourth and final year of his rookie contract, although the Lions have an opportunity to exercise a fifth-year option worth a projected $16.4 million. The deadline to exercise that option is May 1. But the Lions may very well sign Campbell to a contract extension before then.",

    "description": "Udinski is a rising star, but not ready for an NFL head coach position.",
    "fullText": "With the victories come the spoils, or the losses. The losses don’t show up on the scoreboard, but in the pieces that are lost from the victor’s staff. Such is the potential for the Jacksonville Jaguars this offseason with their staff. Defensive coordinator Anthony Campanile recently had a second interview with the Arizona Cardinals, this time in person. But he is not the only Jacksonville coordinator attracting attention from other NFL teams. Jaguars offensive coordinator Grant Udinski has been identified as someone who could one day become a head coach. The Buffalo Bills, who recently fired their head coach, are seeking a new coach and have reached out to Udinski for an interview. The 30-year-old Udinski is considered a very bright offensive mind, and he could be really considered by Buffalo for their head coaching position. But life always has a way of showing us the mistakes we made.\n\nHiring coaches who have not called plays offensively has been shown to us before. In fact, the Tennessee Titans showed us this in 2024 when they hired Cincinnati Bengals offensive coordinator Brian Callahan. He had worked with a multitude of talented quarterbacks, including Peyton Manning and Joe Burrow in some aspects. And even though he was the offensive coordinator in Cincinnati, he did not call the plays. He did, however, put together the gameplans. While Callahan's involvement in the game plans and putting them together was paramount, it does not replace the feel that comes with calling plays. Knowing when and where to call different things in different situations is something that comes with experience in that position. While Callahan may have considered all scenarios when he was the offensive coordinator, that cannot replace the in-tune feeling for what situations call for at certain moments.\n\nWith Udinski, he is a coordinator who has not called plays in Jacksonville. He is surely a part of the braintrust regarding the Jacksonville offense that has helped make Trevor Lawrence an MVP Finalist this year. But when you move over a seat from the assistant to the head coach, things get a little different, as Brian Callahan can attest to. Combine that lack of play-calling experience with the pressure cooker that is the Buffalo Bills' job right now, and Udinski would be entering a situation that could put pressure on him he may not be ready to handle. And in that case, it could ultimately lead to him having a quicker exit than he would want there. Overall, while he is being considered for the job, he may not be the right man for the job at this time and may need more room to grow.\n\nCalling plays does not seem like a big deal to many on the outside looking in, but it is something prospective head coaches need to do the majority of the time. While Udinski is a candidate in Buffalo and is hailed as an ascending coach, the fact of the matter is that he may do best by gaining that play-calling experience before becoming a head coach for longevity’s sake.",

    "fullText": "With only a few weeks left of NFL games until August, it’s time to take a look ahead to the teams that underachieved this season but are set up to take big steps forward next season. These five teams are all more talented than their records this past season indicated, and here is why they will all bounce back and improve next season.\n\nThe Giants have some big names on their defensive front and also have one of the league’s most exciting young quarterbacks in Jaxson Dart. When you add a brand new Super Bowl-winning head coach to the mix in John Harbaugh, things immediately improve.\n\nThe Giants future success goes way beyond that, though. The return of Malik Nabers will have a massive impact on this offense, as will the return of running back Cam Skateboo. The Giants should also be able to improve in the draft and via free agency, setting them up for what should be a much better 2026/2027 season.\n\nIf not for Joe Burrow missing most of the season, the Bengals could have easily won the weak AFC North division. Burrow is arguably a top-three quarterback in the NFL, and when he did suit up this season, the Bengals offense was one of the best in the league.\n\nExpect them to make improvements to their defense through the draft and be a much more competitive team next season. One thing they will need to address as well is their offensive line, so that they can protect Joe Burrow better and keep him healthy.\n\nThe Falcons were exciting early on this season, and they played great football to end the season as well. They have a very exciting offense that is loaded with star players, and the return of Michael Penix Jr. should only improve their chances.\n\nThey hired Kevin Stefanski as their new head coach, who should be a great fit for them, and also give Stefanski a chance to prove what he can do with a talented offense, something he was never given in Cleveland. The Falcons defense was much improved last season and should only continue to improve heading into next season.\n\nThe Vikings got off to a horrible start this season and dug themselves such a deep hole that they couldn’t climb out of. Based on how well they finished the season, though, there is hope that they can get back to being a playoff team in the NFC next season.\n\nThey have a very talented defense, one of the best offensive minds at head coach, and one of the best wide receivers in the league as well. Keeping JJ McCarthy healthy will be very important, but the Vikings could also look to bring in a veteran quarterback to not only push McCarthy but also as insurance in the event that McCarthy gets hurt again or just doesn’t perform well enough.\n\nThe Ravens entered this season as one of the Super Bowl favorites and ended up being the most disappointing team in the league. Lamar Jackson couldn’t stay healthy, the defense struggled for most of the season, and the wide receiving corps underwhelmed.\n\nThey moved on from John Harbaugh this offseason and hired Jesse Minter, who was one of the hottest names on the market. Bringing in a great offensive coordinator to work with the multiple-time MVP award winner, Lamar Jackson, is the team’s next mission. Keeping Jackson healthy, adding another big WR weapon, and getting some fresh blood on the sidelines coaching should lead to a much more successful 2026/2027 season.\n\nCheck out all of our NFL articles: https://www.thebiglead.com/category/nfl/\n\nThe post 5 NFL teams who will take a big step forward next season  appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "A new season in football's National League begins this weekend as the chasing pack seek to make ground on all-conquering Kerry. The Kingdom are the team to beat going into 2026, but there is plenty to play for this season across the divisions with promotion and relegation potentially season-defining. Former Donegal star Brendan Devenney runs his eye over what may lie ahead in year two of Gaelic football's new rules.\n\nI covered last year's league final between Kerry and Mayo which was a poor enough affair.\n\nYou could see nobody was that worried, but what Jack O'Connor does is win the league which is a precursor to the championship.\n\nThey had a couple of rocky games after that with Cork putting it up to them [in Munster] and Meath got to them [in the championship] so we didn't see them as the finished article until they got to the All-Ireland final when they were on another level and reaching those heights again will make them very hard to stop.\n\nIn terms of the game itself, I think a big focus this year will be on scoring and preventing the two-pointers, while winning around the middle on kick-outs will be crucial.\n\nIf teams put a full squeeze on from the kick-out, the majority will be long and if you have big, physical men around the middle, that will be a huge asset.\n\nDefensively, you just can't lie in and shut the game down now because you can be picked off with two-pointers or if you move out, you can be hit with a ball over the top.\n\nAfter a period to fully figure out their approach, this weekend will be interesting to see how teams have adapted.",

    "description": "Jason Williams inbox: Baltimore and Buffalo fired highly successful coaches. Does it make Bengals look worse for sticking with Zac Taylor?",
    "fullText": "Ask columnist Jason Williams anything − sports or non-sports – and he’ll pick some of your questions and comments from his inbox and respond on Cincinnati.com. Email: jwilliams@enquirer.com\n\nMessage: John Harbaugh won a Super Bowl in Baltimore. He won eight road playoff games over 18 seasons there, something no other coach has done. He still got fired.\n\nSean McDermott made Buffalo a regular contender in the AFC, at one point going six straight seasons of winning at least one playoff game. He still got fired.\n\nAnd yet Zac Taylor remains the Bengals’ head coach after missing the playoffs three straight years. Don’t you think all these firings of top coaches makes the Bengals look even worse for keeping Zac?\n\nReply: Guess it depends on the audience. It looks bad to the national media, which can’t accept that the Bengals aren’t like everyone else in how they operate. Here at home, we’re conditioned to accept Bengals mediocrity and so most people don’t think it looks all that bad.\n\nBig picture, the moves in Baltimore and Buffalo highlight that the Bengals’ standards aren’t congruent with the AFC’s elite franchises. You already knew that, but it’s just another reminder that some teams have a whole other level of expectations – a level that’s hard to comprehend around here.\n\nBaltimore and Buffalo are legitimately trying to win a Super Bowl. Meanwhile, Bengals ownership is happy if the team is competitive and finishes with a winning record. Did you notice that Bengals owner Mike Brown pointed out the “four straight winning seasons” in the first sentence of his statement early this month? Well, two of those ended with no playoff berth.\n\nThat said, I’m glad Taylor didn’t get fired. The team’s failures aren’t his fault. Taylor can only do so much with the inadequate players that ownership and the front office keep giving him.\n\nAnd there is something to be said about being patient with a coach. It’s a tough balancing act, but Taylor did oversee the best two-year stretch in team history – and it wasn’t that long ago.\n\nThe notion of firing a coach after one bad season is crazy, like the Ravens did with Harbaugh. On one hand, you like the message that mediocrity won’t cut it. On the other, though, it’s a cautionary tale to be careful what you wish for. It’ll be incredibly difficult for new Baltimore coach Jesse Minter to match Harbaugh’s success, let alone top it.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Baltimore, Buffalo go for Super Bowl excellence as Bengals stay same",

    "fullText": "There are just four NFL teams remaining in postseason play, with four former UNC football standouts scattered across those rosters. One Tar Heel in particular, though, is MVP contender Drake Maye.\n\nA quarterback who starred at North Carolina from 2021-2023, Maye is anchoring the New England Patriots' most successful season since Bill Belichick's head coaching days. Maye has his team in its first AFC Championship game since 2019, when New England won its most recent Super Bowl Title.\n\nOn Thursday, Maye earned some well-deserved recognition for his breakout campaign, earning one of the AP's five finalist nominations for NFL MVP.\n\nJoining Maye in this exclusive group are San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey, Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence and Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, the last of whom is widely considered the MVP frontrunner.\n\nMaye has a golden chance to deliver his MVP-clinching moment on Sunday, with the Patriots traveling to face the Denver Broncos in a cold, 3 p.m. ET AFC Championship clash.\n\nOne step closer. 👟\n\nThe Real MVP. @DrakeMaye2 pic.twitter.com/AJSnZElrPm\n\n— Carolina Football (@UNCFootball) January 22, 2026\n\nBias aside, Maye makes an extremely strong case to win MVP in his \"Sophomore\" NFL season. Maye's 4,394 passing yards are fourth amongst quarterbacks in the regular season, his 31 passing touchdowns are third and his 77.1 QBR led the NFL.\n\nMaye also compiled 450 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns in regular season action, showcasing the same dual-threat ability he did as a Tar Heel.\n\nDespite five turnovers in the postseason, Maye is playing solid football in leading New England one win from the Super Bowl. Maye completed 33 of his first 56 passes for 447 yards and four touchdowns, while adding 76 rushing yards on 14 carries.\n\nIf Maye takes better care of the football on Sunday and his offensive line holds up, Maye will have no issue putting an exclamation point on his case for NFL MVP.\n\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on. Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: Drake Maye tabbed a finalist for 2025 AP NFL MVP award",

    "description": "A look at 20 free agents who have played for a defense with Parker as a coach, and how each performed in 2025.",
    "fullText": "One of the oldest tenets in the NFL is that players tend to follow the coaches who have had positive impacts on their development. With Christian Parker in line to become the next Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator, and with his glowing reputation as a teacher and tactician, it is fair to wonder which former players could be joining him in Dallas.\n\nFans know, the club is in dire need of additional defensive talent. And while Parker is moving up to playcaller for the first time in his career, his relationships with players doesn't necessarily have to be limited to secondary players just because he was the defensive passing game coordinator. There could absolutely be linebackers who have been involved in those meetings who are interested in working for the 34-year old under the bright lights in Dallas.\n\nThe first glimpse is to who are pending free agents within the Philadelphia Eagles organization but things don't stop there. Parker also coached with the Denver Broncos from 2021 through 2023, and players from that era could still easily be able to contribute in 2026.\n\nUnfortunately for the Cowboys, the players who likely have most benefitted from Parker's tutelage are either still under their rookie deals with the Eagles, or have signed on long-term with their team.\n\nPatrick Surtain II: First-team All-Pro\nQuinyon Mitchell: First-team All-Pro\nCooper DeJean: First-team All-Pro\n\n... and all before Christian Parker turns 35. \n\nwelcome to the #Cowboys, sir. https://t.co/vmUEdicnZM\n\n— Patrik [No C] Walker (@VoiceOfTheStar) January 22, 2026\n\nHere's a rundown of the top potential free agents who could now be in the mix in Dallas, tiered by their 2025 Pro Football Focus overall defensive grades.\n\nCB Ja'Quan McMillian (RFA), Denver, 2022-23, 80.3 grade in 2025\n\nMcMillian is a former UDFA who has been a staple in the Denver secondary. They will most likely slap him with a 1st round or 2nd round tender, taking him off the market.\n\nSafety Avonte Maddox, Detroit, 2024, 79.1 grade in 2025\n\nMaddox had an incredible single season in Detroit, but didn't fare as well in Philly. He had a 61.9 overall grade in his one season working with Parker.\n\nSafety CJ Gardner-Johnson, Philadelphia, 2024, 51.4 grade in 2025\n\nNot a great year for Gardner-Johnson in Chicago, but he did have a 77.0 grade w/ Parker in 2024.\n\nLB Justin Strnad, Denver, 2021-23, 72.1 grade in 2025\n\nStrnad barely played while Parker was in Denver, but that doesn't mean they didn't have a chance to form some level of working relationship. Now that he's getting, he's an intriguing option for the Cowboys to fill out their linebacker core with.\n\nCB Fabian Moreau, Minnesota, 2023, 71.4\n\nMoreau has a strong grade, but only played 198 snaps in 2025 as a reserve. Could definitely be added as a depth piece to help round out the roster if Parker liked what he saw their one year together in 2023; Moreau graded out at 62.4 on 739 snaps.\n\nLB Alex Singleton, Denver, 2022-23, 70.1\n\nSingle had a strong first year in Denver with Parker in 2022, his highest graded of his six seasons at 79.1.\n\nSafety PJ Locke, Denver, 2021-23, 63.0\n\nNothing much stands out with Locke, who has mostly been a reserve, but he did have 3 sacks on 11 pash rush snaps in 2023 with Parker.\n\nLB Nakobe Dean, Philadelphia, 2024-25, 62.2\n\nDean has generally been regarded as a bust with the Eagles, but when he got starter snaps through the year in 2024 with Parker, he had a 77.4 grade, including a strong year in both run defense and pass rush.\n\nThose aren't the only back-seven players who are on the free agent market this year, but they are the ones who turned in average-or-better performances. Here's a look at other free agent linebackers, cornerbacks and safeties with ties to Parker.\n\nCB Adoree' Jackson, Philadelphia, 2025, 53.6 grade in 2025\n\nSafety Marcus Epps, Philadelphia, 2025, 51.8 grade in 2025\n\nSafety Reed Blankenship, Philadelphia, 2024-25, 42.6 grade in 2025\n\nLB Ben Van Sumeren (RFA), Philadelphia, 2024-25, N/A\n\nLB Josey Jewell, Out of League, 2021-23\n\nSafety Justin Simmons, Out of League, 2021-23\n\nSafety Kareem Jackson, Out of the League, 2021-22\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cowboys Wire: Eagles, NFL free agents who may follow DC Christian Parker to Cowboys",

    "description": "A look at NFL Comeback Player of the Year odds, with Christian McCaffrey as the betting favorite.",
    "fullText": "With Super Bowl LX nearly two weeks away, five finalists have been announced for the 2025 NFL Comeback Player of the Year.\n\nAfter a campaign in which Christian McCaffrey suited up for every game and posted a career-high 413 touches from scrimmage, the San Francisco 49ers running back is a heavy favorite to comeaway with the award.\n\nHere are the latest NFL odds ahead of the annual NFL Honors ceremony, scheduled for February 5 at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco.\n\n• Over the last seven years, the NFL CPOY Award has been handed out to a quarterback.\n\n• From 2014 to 2018, every Comeback Player of the Year had suffered a season-ending injury during the previous year, and Alex Smith won in 2020 after recovering from a devastating leg injury that almost required amputation.\n\n• Joe Burrow joins Chad Pennington (2006 and 2008) as the only player to win this award twice.\n\nHere are a few tips to keep in mind when wagering on NFL awards betting odds.\n\nSportsbooks will adjust NFL awards odds as the season goes on. In the preseason and the early weeks of the regular season, betting on dark horses can prove very profitable. As the season continues, expect to see odds tighten around the favorites. At that point, it becomes wise to focus on the players near the top of the odds board, and betting big underdogs is unwise.\n\nLive long shots can provide tremendous value. Look at younger players on the verge of breaking out, or guys that have already been playing at a high level but could take the next step now that they are in an ideal situation with a new team, coach, or system. Other players that can give a great payout are established stars coming off underperforming seasons due to injuries or other factors.\n\nWhen placing futures bets on individual awards, keep in mind that voters, not a scoreboard, are often the deciding factor. Voters can be influenced by a variety of factors, including media coverage and public opinion. Consider what the media narrative is for a particular season and which players they seem to be rooting for and against.\n\nHistorical trends, especially recent ones, can give you a good idea of which way voters tend to lean. For example, the NFL MVP has been handed out to a quarterback in 14 of the last 15 seasons. Identifying those trends is a good way to separate the true contenders from the pretenders.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "fullText": "Jarrett Stidham has started four games in his NFL career and all of them came at the end of losing seasons, so he has no experience with what he's going to experience this weekend.\n\nBo Nix's fractured ankle has thrust Stidham into the starting quarterback spot for the Broncos in this Sunday's AFC Championship Game against the Patriots. The implications of the game for both the Broncos and Stidham are clear.\n\nA win would send the Broncos to the Super Bowl and it would take Stidham from unheralded backup to a household name overnight. On Wednesday, Stidham said he knows this is \"not about myself\" but how he can \"help my teammates succeed on Sunday.\" He said the approach to doing that is by keeping things as routine as possible despite the unusual circumstances.\n\n\"I think what I always go back to — in any game, regular season, preseason, the AFC Championship — it's still the same game,\" Stidham said, via the team's website. \"Obviously, there are implications and winner advances, all that kind of stuff, but at the end of the day, it's still football. That's how I view it. I'm not treating it any differently. I'm not treating my preparation any differently. I'm just going to go out there and play and be myself. I think that's the biggest thing. I'm not going to try to be somebody that I'm not. I know how I can play, and I know the kind of guys I have around me and the kind of team that we have. So, we all just have to play within ourselves.\"\n\nBroncos teammates and head coach Sean Payton have expressed confidence in Stidham's ability to handle being thrown into the fire in a do-or-die situation, but one look at the odds shows how much doubt exists outside of the organization. Stidham won't be able to quiet that before Sunday, so it is something else to ignore as he prepares for the biggest moment of his professional career.",

    "description": "Ohio State wide receiver Carnell Tate was predicted to be drafted into a good situation in NFL, per ESPN's Mel Kiper.",
    "fullText": "Ohio State wide receiver Carnell Tate shouldn't have to wait long to hear his name on draft night.\n\nTate recorded 51 catches for 875 yards and nine touchdowns on the Buckeyes, helping the program make it to the College Football Playoff quarterfinal.\n\nESPN's Mel Kiper is projecting Tate to be a top-five draft pick. Most players drafted that early go to teams with bad situations.\n\nHowever, Tate might have luck in store for him in his rookie season.\n\nKiper thinks the New York Giants will take Tate with the No. 5 pick. Tate would be an intriguing addition to an offense that already boasts a star receiver in Malik Nabers, and those two could cause matchup nightmares for opposing defenses.\n\n\"The Giants have a lot of needs, but similar to Tennessee, they have a second-year quarterback looking for help,\" Kiper wrote. \"Yes, wide receiver Malik Nabers (knee) and running back Cam Skattebo (ankle/leg) will be back on the field, but wideout Wan'Dale Robinson is a free agent, and Nabers can't be the target on all of Jaxson Dart's throws.\n\n\"Taking a first-round wide receiver wouldn't be new to recently hired coach John Harbaugh; in Baltimore, he used four Day 1 picks starting in 2015 on the position (Zay Flowers, Rashod Bateman, Hollywood Brown and Breshad Perriman).\"\n\nThe Giants went all-in for former Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh. With Tate, New York's offense could be a threat to go along with a defense that should improve in 2026 under Harbaugh.\n\nHarbaugh took the job with the Giants in part because he believes Dart can be an elite passer in the league.\n\n\"It starts with the quarterback for sure,\" Harbaugh said, via the Giants' website. \"You build your team around your quarterback. You build your team around your players and what they do well. I like the way (Dart) plays.\n\n\"I like his talent, skill set, all the things he's accomplished, but more than that, I like who he is and what he's about. To me, he's about football. This young guy loves football. He wants to talk football all the time and that's kind of what I like doing too.\"\n\nTate would certainly help accelerate Dart's development.\n\nIf Tate goes at No. 5, he'd join Chris Olave, Garrett Wilson, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Marvin Harrison Jr. and Emeka Egbuka as former Buckeyes to go in the first round.\n\nThose players are making big impacts on their respective teams.",

His path took him from Washington to Colorado in 2023, following opportunity, belief, and the promise of a fresh start under Deion Sanders.\n\nInstead, the game nearly took his life.\n\nIn a deeply personal message shared publicly, Smalls revealed that he has medically retired from college football after learning he was born with spinal stenosis, a condition that dangerously narrows the spinal canal.

He told himself it would pass.\n\nMORE: Meet Abella Danger—The one Miami celebrity fan Curt Cignetti won't tell you to Google\n\nEventually, the symptoms became impossible to explain away.

That absence is notable, especially in a sport where public thanks are often extended even in far less personal moments.\n\nOnce viewed as an immediate impact defender and a future NFL prospect, Smalls exited the game quietly. There was no press conference. No farewell moment. No orchestrated goodbye. Just a decision made privately, months earlier, with life itself hanging in the balance.\n\nMORE: D’Angelo Ponds’ father sends 'BTA' message to Michael Irvin after Indiana's title win\n\n“I medically retired,” Smalls wrote. “Ending my athletic career for good.”\n\nThe words are simple.

    "fullText": "Bengals urged to make NFL Draft decision they haven't made in 15 years originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals, after a disappointing 2025 campaign marred by injuries to two of the team's biggest stars on both sides of the ball, need to bounce back in a major way next season.\n\nWhile the 6-11 record stings, it did allow the Bengals to land the 10th overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. With that top-10 pick, the Bengals need to land an instant-impact player.\n\nESPN writer Ben Baby is urging the Bengals to take a playmaker at this spot, and one that would make team history for the first time since 2010, over 15 years ago.\n\n\"The Bengals haven't used a top-10 pick on defense since 2010, when they drafted linebacker Keith Rivers with the No. 9 pick. But they can't afford to follow history this time,\" Baby writes. \"The team needs playmakers on defense.\"\n\nCincinnati has a star-studded offense, with Joe Burrow, Ja'Marr Chase, Tee Higgins, and Chase Brown being more than enough to contend.\n\nOffensively, the team isn't lacking playmakers. But the same cannot be said for the defensive side of the ball. The Bengals need to add to their defense, whether it's a pass rusher or a defensive back; defense is a must this offseason.\n\nMore: Two reasons why Bengals fans should look forward to defense in 2026\n\nSomeone like Ohio State's Caleb Downs would be an incredible addition. While a safety might not be a popular pick, it would be a worthwhile one for a Bengals defense in need of all-around upgrades on that side of the ball.\n\nBaby is calling on the Bengals to add a defensive playmaker in the upcoming 2026 NFL Draft, and it's not hard to understand. The defense needs to get better, and the Bengals' best option in the draft will likely be a defensive player.\n\nIt's a logical decision, and one that the Bengals front office, led by Duke Tobin, should strong considering making. The Bengals should make some franchise history by taking a defensive player inside the top-10 for the first time since 2010.\n\nBengals' Chase Brown believes average fan can gain one yard in an NFL game\n\nBengals receive $33 million contract projection on Trey Hendrickson despite injury\n\nBengals announce Zac Taylor decision after rough 2025 season\n\nZac Taylor was mad for dumbest reason ever after Myles Garrett's record-breaking sack\n\nJa'Marr Chase says issues Bengals need to change are 'pretty obvious'\n\nBengals urged to make aggressive Chase Brown contract decision",

    "title": "Regarding 2026 Colts, one NFL exec makes somewhat surprising prediction",
    "description": "This latest NFL exec prediction for the Colts may surprise you entering the 2026 offseason.",
    "fullText": "According to ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler, one NFL executive made a surprising prediction regarding the 2026 Indianapolis Colts. Namely, that the Colts will win the division for the first time since 2014:\n\n“But they showed a proof of concept with what they had through 10 games,” an AFC executive said via Fowler. “They had Daniel Jones playing well. The roster has talent. They are closer than people might think.”\n\nProjected as a routine bottom feeder in NFL power rankings entering this past season, the Colts shockingly became one of the hottest teams football, once sitting at 8-2 atop the AFC, and featuring a historically elite league offense—where the fresh pairing of head coach Shane Steichen and newly signed starting quarterback Daniel Jones was paying off major dividends for Indianapolis.\n\nUnfortunately, thereafter, starting quarterback Jones suffered a fractured fibula, limiting his mobility and the dynamic Colts offensive attack, before ultimately suffering a season-ending torn Achilles in Week 14 at Jacksonville—presumably because of physical overcompensation for the earlier lower leg injury.\n\nThe Colts would end up losing 7 straight games to close out the season, as in Jones’ 4-game absence, the team desperately turned to 44-year-old, unretired veteran quarterback Philip Rivers, and then rookie Riley Leonard for the regular season finale, once the team was already eliminated from playoff contention.\n\nIt wasn’t just Jones though, as particularly on defense, the Colts sustained key injuries to the unit’s three best players: DeForest Buckner, Sauce Gardner, and Charvarius Ward. On offense, the team also lost starting veteran offensive tackle Braden Smith and even left tackle Bernhard Raimann for a short stint to close out 2025.\n\nIn theory, if the Colts can re-sign Jones, who’s a pending 2026 NFL free agent, and get some of those other returning standout players healthy, they could pick up right where they left off before injuries completely derailed what once was one of the best starts to an Indianapolis regular season in years.\n\nThat being said, Jones is coming off a torn Achilles, which can be a potentially career-altering injury, especially for a 28-year-old quarterback who relies a lot on his mobility, and particularly in head coach Shane Steichen’s offense and the versatile ground game with star workhorse Jonathan Taylor.\n\nHaving suffered the injury later in the season, it’s a fair question of whether Jones will be ready for the regular season opener, let alone training camp. Even if he does return in time to be ready for 2026, what physical condition will he realistically be in? His other NFL quarterback colleagues have not recently fared all that well coming back from similar injuries to-date. Will Jones be the exception? Will it take longer than a year to recover?\n\nSome of those other veteran players hoping to potentially return are defensive tackle DeForest Buckner (neck), cornerback Charvarius Ward (three concussions last year), and pending free agent offensive tackle Braden Smith (concussion/neck). All of whom are question marks to make a full recovery as well.\n\nDespite a stalwart defense under head coach DeMeco Ryans, the Texans appear rather one-dimensional with starting quarterback C.J. Stroud’s continued playoff struggles at the moment. However, the Jacksonville Jaguars may be the toast of the AFC South until proven otherwise—as the reigning AFC South Champions, and a rival just as complete and talented as Indianapolis when at full strength and truly going right.\n\nThe Jaguars have won 5 of the 6 matchups against the Colts under Steichen and remain the divisional rival to beat within the AFC South. They’re the best team within the division until proven otherwise.\n\nIt’s also not how you start, it’s how you finish. In contrast to the Colts disastrous losing skid, the Jaguars and Texans won 8 and 9 games in a row to close out the 2025 campaign respectively. This current Colts nucleus has routinely suffered late season collapses, and they’ll have to finally overcome that and complete the job in 2026.",

    "description": "Could the Miami Dolphins replace Tua Tagovailoa with Malik Willis this offseason?",
    "fullText": "The Miami Dolphins officially have a new general manager and head coach for the first time in over a decade. Now, with the new era set to begin, the duo must find a way to improve a position that has plagued the Dolphins since the day Dan Marino retired.\n\nTua Tagovailoa showed flashes, but his day as the Dolphins’ starting quarterback is over, with reports surfacing that the team was ready to move on and find someone else to lead the new era of Miami football.\n\nAccording to ESPN’s NFL Insider, Jeremy Fowler, that player could be someone both Jon-Eric Sullivan and Jeff Hafley have familiarity with from the last few years in Green Bay.\n\nA player who just so happens to be a free agent this season.\n\n-Lamar Jackson to the Raiders\n-A.J. Brown to the Bills\n-Malik Willis to Dolphins or Browns\n-Kyler or Geno to New York\n\nExecs/scouts/coaches make bold predictions on 2026 offseasonhttps://t.co/vrn0rBuPCN\n\n— Jeremy Fowler (@JFowlerESPN) January 20, 2026\n\nIn a recent ESPN article breaking down some of the off-season’s most probable trades and signings, Fowler suggests that Sullivan and Hafley could bring in a quarterback whom they saw first-hand take over when Jordan Love went down. And to be quite honest, he played some pretty damn good football.\n\nSo much so that it won’t be just the Dolphins jockeying for his services. As Fowler writes, if Daniel Jones returns to Indianapolis, there’s a very good chance that Willis could be the top quarterback on the market. (He probably still is even if Jones does hit the open market, but that’s a conversation for another day)\n\nAnother team that league executives believe could be interested in Willis is the Cleveland Browns.\n\n“I just don’t think [the Browns] go into the season with Shedeur [Sanders] as their top option,” an NFC personnel man said. “And getting the right quarterback in the draft isn’t a guarantee based on where they pick.”\n\nCleveland has two first-round picks, but with Oregon’s Dante Moore returning to school and other key factors, Willis could be their best bet for adding legit competition to a room that has Shedeur Sanders and Dillion Gabriel currently battling for the QB1 spot.\n\nBut as Fowler says, Miami will have a better beat on Willis and his potential over any other team.\n\n“No regime will know Willis’ strengths better than Miami, which just hired a brain trust of GM Jon-Eric Sullivan and head coach Jeff Hafley from Green Bay. The Packers valued Willis’ development and Miami could bear the fruits of that labor.”\n\nI know this is giving some of us older folks a bit of ‘déjà vu’ as it feels eerily similar to the days of Joe Philbin and everyone wanting Matt Flynn, because we were QB-starved and unquestioningly believed things might be different.\n\nBut Willis has legit tools (I’ll do a breakdown in the coming weeks) and could be the perfect QB to help usher in this new era of Dolphins football, while allowing Sullivan and Hafley to find the future in the 2027 or 2028 draft class.\n\nMalik Willis pic.twitter.com/iV0XCHJNZl\n\n— Ian Hartitz (@Ihartitz) January 14, 2026\n\nLast season in Green Bay, Willis completed 85.7 % of his passes for 422 yards and 3 touchdowns in four appearances (1 start). In total, the former third-round pick of the 2022 NFL Draft (86th overall) has started six games, finishing with a 3-3 record.\n\nThe cap situation is bleak, and the Dolphins have to find a suitor for Tua. But if Brandon Shore and Sullivan can find a way to make it work, I think Miami fans would be delighted to have a player like Malik Willis behind center.\n\nThen again, all of this sounds too good to be true.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the Miami Dolphins signing free agent quarterback Malik Willis this offseason? Do you think he’d be the perfect fit for this next era of Dolphins football? How do you feel saying goodbye to Tua Tagovailoa after what appeared to be a promising start to the McDaniel era? Are you happy with the head coach/GM duo Miami now has? Let us know in the comments section below!",

    "description": "The 4 teams still alive combined for just 14 losses all season.",
    "fullText": "Conference championship weekend includes three teams that went 14-3 in the regular season and also the Los Angeles Rams, who some consider the best team in the NFL.\n\nOf course, there’s an asterisk. One of those 14-3 teams, the Denver Broncos, had the gut punch of finding out Bo Nix will miss the rest of the playoffs due to a broken bone in his ankle. That changed the playoff landscape, and also the betting odds for the conference championship round.\n\nHere are three betting storylines for the NFL’s final four, with odds from BetMGM:\n\nIt’s impossible to discuss the AFC championship game without a dive into the Broncos’ quarterback conundrum.\n\nBroncos coach Sean Payton shocked everyone with the announcement that Bo Nix would undergo season-ending surgery, meaning Jarrett Stidham would start the AFC championship game. Stidham will set the record for fewest career starts (four) of any starting quarterback in NFL conference championship game history.\n\nThere was a huge adjustment to the line. On lookahead lines for potential matchups last week, the Broncos were a 1.5-point favorite over the Patriots. That moved all the way to Patriots -5.5, but it has come back to Patriots -5 at BetMGM. The Broncos could close as the biggest home underdog in NFL conference championship game history.\n\nBefore the season, 12 oddsmakers broke down the point-spread difference between starting quarterback and backup quarterback for each team to Yahoo Sports’ Ben Fawkes, and the average difference from Nix and Stidham was 3.85 points. The line actually moved 6.5 points, based on that lookahead line, which seems like an overreaction.\n\nThe NFC championship game is the third meeting between the Seahawks and Rams this season, which means we have point spread history for two other games.\n\nIn the first meeting in Los Angeles, the Rams were 3-point favorites and won but didn’t cover, outlasting Seattle 21-19 when the Seahawks missed a long field goal as time expired. In the second game, the Seahawks were 1.5-point favorites and trailed by 16 points in the fourth quarter before coming back to win but not cover in a wild 38-37 win.\n\nThe line this time has moved the Seahawks’ way, even though their win over the Rams was fluky with a historic comeback. Seattle is -2.5 at -120 odds, which means it could move to Seahawks -3 before kickoff. The Seahawks’ rest over the last two weeks, with a bye followed by a blowout win over the 49ers, might factor in. The Rams’ wild-card game came down to the final minute and then the divisional round game at Chicago went to overtime. The Seahawks have also looked impressive in the three games since that comeback over the Rams, while Los Angeles hasn’t played a great game since then.\n\nBoth of these teams have been good to bettors. The Seahawks and Rams both went 12-5 against the spread this regular season, in a four-way tie for the best ATS record in the NFL according to Action Network (the Patriots and Jaguars were the others).\n\nAs has been the case for weeks, the two NFC West teams are atop the Super Bowl odds. No matter which NFC team wins Sunday, they’re very likely to be favored in Super Bowl LX.\n\nThe Broncos’ quarterback situation has also affected the current Super Bowl odds:\n\nIt is a bit jarring to see Jarrett Stidham at +2000 to win Super Bowl MVP, considering he hasn’t thrown a pass in either of the last two regular seasons and wasn’t on anyone’s radar just a few days ago.",

    "fullText": "Joe Burrow woke up from a social media slumber on Monday to weigh in on a pair of calls that sparked controversy in this weekend's divisional round playoff games.\n\nAs far as he's concerned, there is no controversy.\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals quarterback tweeted a defense of game officials for their rulings on \"two plays\" that he declared \"were not difficult calls.\"\n\nHe mentions two plays \"yesterday,\" but is almost certainly referencing a late interception on a contested ball in the Broncos' divisional round playoff win over the Bills on Saturday and another play on a contested ball Sunday that was ruled a catch for Los Angeles receiver Davante Adams in the Rams' win over the Bears.\n\n\"The amount of ppl that don’t understand what a catch is in the rule book flabbergasts me,\" Burrow wrote. \"And it’s not the officials. The two plays yesterday were not difficult calls, and they got them both right.\"\n\nThe amount of ppl that don’t understand what a catch is in the rule book flabbergasts me. And it’s not the officials. The two plays yesterday were not difficult calls, and they got them both right.\n\n— Joey Burrow (@JoeyB) January 19, 2026\n\nOther than a retweet of a Netflix post promoting a show about him, that was Burrow's first tweet since April 26, 2024. He apparently feels strongly about this.\n\nThe first play in question was Ja'Quan McMillian's interception of Josh Allen in overtime of Denver's 33-30 win Saturday night. Bills receiver Brandin Cooks secured the ball in his hands on a deep pass that would have set the Bills up in position for a game-winning field goal.\n\nCooks was diving to the ground as he made the catch and still had the ball in his hands when his knee hit the turf. But McMillian had tight coverage and snatched the ball from Cooks' grasp after they hit the ground. He stood up with possession of the ball, and officials awarded him an interception. Denver drove for the game-winning field goal on its ensuing drive.\n\nWOW!! Interception Josh Allen on this crazy play pic.twitter.com/J7UyosDna5\n\n— Rate the Refs (@Rate_the_Refs) January 18, 2026\n\nOn the second play in question, Adams caught a ball in traffic in a tie game in the fourth quarter of Sunday's Rams-Bears divisional matchup.\n\nHe didn't take a step after securing the ball and was immediately taken down to the turf by a pair of Bears defenders. As his knee hit the turf, Bears defensive back Tyrique Stevenson had his hand on the ball, which was still in Adams' grasp. Stevenson then stripped the ball from Adams before Adams fully hit the ground.\n\nHow is this a catch from Davante Adams but the Brandin Cooks play wasn’t?\n\n*Both plays are catches fyi #BillsMafia | #GoBills \n pic.twitter.com/UWz2dkuTqU\n\n— Peter DiBiasi (@DibiasiPeter) January 19, 2026\n\nOn this play, Adams was awarded a catch. The Rams went on to score a touchdown on the drive for a 17-10 lead en route to a 20-17 overtime win.\n\nNBC rules analyst Terry McAulay agreed with the call on the field on the broadcast. He also was watching Saturday night and tweeted his agreement of the call on McMillian's interception. Per McAulay, Adams made a football act \"common to the game\" on his play that was enough to rule it a complete catch before his knee hit the ground.\n\n\"He clearly completed the catch on this one,\" McAulay said. \"He has it long enough to perform an act common to the game, and then he goes to the ground, and his knee goes down prior to him losing control.\"\n\nIn the case of McMillian's interception, Cooks was diving to the ground and, per McAulay, didn't establish a completed catch before his knee hit the ground, allowing McMillian to strip the ball for the turnover.\n\n\"A player going to the ground to catch a pass must maintain control during and after contact with the ground,\" McAulay wrote. That's the rule. Apply accordingly.\"\n\nBurrow didn't go into further details beyond his initial tweet, but it's safe to assume that he agrees with McAulay's interpretation of the rules. And those were the same conclusions that officials on the field reached in both games.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Chicago Bears' 2025-26 NFL postseason run came to a close Sunday night from a chilly Soldier Field, as the Los Angeles Rams took advantage of a Caleb Williams interception in a 17-17 overtime period that led to the Rams' eventual game-winning 42-yard field goal from kicker Harrison Mevis to send them to the NFC Championship next Sunday vs. the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nThe game never reaches the extra session, however, without Williams' late-game heroics. The Bears put together one last drive late in the fourth quarter, needing to convert a fourth-and-4 to keep the season afloat.

    "fullText": "The Buffalo Bills’ 2025-2026 NFL season ended in heartbreak, and quarterback Josh Allen did not hide the toll it took on him. Following the Bills’ playoff loss to the Denver Broncos, Allen cried while addressing reporters, apologizing to his teammates and expressing disappointment over how the season concluded.\n\nThe Bills’ campaign came to an end on January 17, after a defeat to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Divisional Round. Speaking at the post-game press conference, Josh Allen struggled to hold back tears as he addressed the result and his mindset following the loss. “It’s extremely difficult,” Allen said. He continued, “I feel like I let my teammates down tonight.”\n\nWhen asked why the defeat affected him so profoundly, Allen explained that the game featured several moments the team failed to capitalize on. He said there were “missed opportunities throughout the game,” before adding, “It’s been a long season. I hate how it ended, and that’s gonna stick with me for a long time.”\n\nJosh Allen also addressed what he told his teammates in the immediate aftermath of the loss, making it clear that emotions were still raw in the locker room. “I haven’t been doing a lot of talking,” Allen admitted. “I love my teammates, and I’m extremely sorry, and I’m extremely disappointed in how this ended,” he continued. The game itself ended in overtime, when Will Lutz converted a 24-yard field goal to secure the win for the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe press conference also came at a meaningful time in Allen’s personal life, as his wife, Hailee Steinfeld, is currently pregnant and expecting the couple’s first child.\n\nWith the victory, Denver advanced to the AFC Championship Game, where the top-seeded team will face either the New England Patriots or the Houston Texans on January 25. The opponent will be determined following the Patriots-Texans matchup on January 18.\n\nThe post Bills’ Josh Allen Cries After Loss: ‘I Let My Teammates Down’ appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "fullText": "CHICAGO (AP) — Caleb Williams' last throw in regulation was a backpedaling, fourth-down rainbow that landed in Cole Kmet's hands in the corner of the end zone for a breathtaking touchdown.\n\nHis last throw of the game was the beginning of the end for Chicago's surprising season.\n\nWilliams almost rallied the Bears to another memorable win on Sunday night. But he threw his third interception in overtime and Matthew Stafford drove the Los Angeles Rams to Harrison Mevis' winning field goal in a 20-17 victory in the divisional round of the playoffs.\n\n“It's tough. In these moments, you feel that you let your team down,” Williams said. “You feel this or that. It’s a good lesson learned for us, first time being in this situation for me and for us as a team. I’m excited for what’s to come. But obviously going to go back and watch this and figure out how I can be better, and that’s the exciting part.”\n\nThe 24-year-old Williams led Chicago to an NFL-record seven wins this season when trailing in last 2 minutes of regulation. He threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to DJ Moore with 1:43 left in a 31-27 victory over Green Bay in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nThis time, the Bears (12-7) were losing 17-10 when they got the ball back with 1:50 left in the fourth quarter. And, just like before, Williams delivered.\n\nFacing a fourth-and-4 at the Rams 14 with 27 seconds left, Williams took a shotgun snap and surveyed the field. The No. 1 pick in the 2024 draft was forced to backpedal as the pocket collapsed, and he scampered all the way back to the 40 with Jared Verse, Josaiah Stewart and Braden Fiske all in pursuit for the Rams.\n\nWilliams turned, saw Kmet in the end zone and threw the ball in his direction just as Verse and Stewart got to the second-year QB.\n\n“I ended up getting a little bit of pressure, so try and break contain and just break angles and slow those guys down so that when I do turn around, I can have a little bit more time possibly to find somebody,” Williams said, “and they did a good job containing me, so I just gained a little bit more depth, and I saw Cole one-on-one over there.”\n\nKmet wrestled with Rams cornerback Cobie Turner before hauling in the pass, sending a charge through the crowd of 60,253 on a frigid night at Soldier Field.\n\n“It felt like a pretty easy pitch-and-catch and kind of felt like it was in slow motion,” Kmet said. “I can’t believe Caleb.”\n\nBears coach Ben Johnson called the throw “ridiculous.”\n\n“There’s some things that you just can’t coach. ... He’s got a knack, he’s clutch,” Johnson said.\n\nAccording to Next Gen Stats, Williams' pass traveled 51.2 yards in the air for the longest completed pass by air distance in the red zone since at least 2016. He made the throw from 26.5 yards behind the line of scrimmage; no quarterback since 2016, according to Next Gen Stats, had completed a pass from a depth of more than 22 yards.\n\nIt had a completion probability of 17.8%.\n\n“It was the most special throw that I’ve ever seen. I’ve seen him do that so many times this year,” Bears safety Kevin Byard said.\n\nWilliams also threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Moore on fourth down on the first play of the second quarter. But his three interceptions were costly.\n\nThe Bears had a chance to win the game in overtime. They drove to the Los Angeles 48 before Williams was picked off by Rams safety Kam Curl on a deep ball intended for Moore.\n\n“Just a miscommunication between him and I,” Williams said. \"Tried to flatten him off under the safety, and he kept it vertical from what I saw, obviously, in the moment.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "description": "Here's how the teams in the AFC and NFC title games stack up against each other.",
    "fullText": "NFL power rankings: Three reasons Seahawks, Patriots, Rams and Broncos will (and won't) win Super Bowl 60 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWho will win Super Bowl 60? The wide-open 2025-2026 NFL playoffs started with a combined 14 teams from the AFC and NFC, but it's down to four with the conference championship matchups now set for next Sunday.\n\nThe AFC has held form, with the No. 1 seed Denver Broncos (14-3) ready to host the No. 2 seed New England Patriots (14-3). The best team in the NFC, the No. 1 seed Seattle Seahawks (14-3) will host the No. 5 Los Angeles Rams (12-5) in another NFC West rubber match.\n\nAny one of those teams can either win the Super Bowl or fall flat in the league semifinals. Based on each team's odds to finish the playoffs undefeated and raise the Lombardi Trophy, here's looking at why the Seahawks, Patriots, Rams and Broncos will succeed or fail through the last two rounds:\n\n(Futures odds courtesy of Caesars Sportsbook)\n\nThe Seahawks led the NFL scoring defense (16.6 points allowed per game) and were third in total defense (282.8 yards per game) during the regular season. They were No. 2 against the run (92.6 yards per game) and No. 9 against the pass (190.3). They lived up to that reputation and then some in obliterating the 49ers in the divisional round of the playoffs, 41-6.\n\nMORE: How Seahawks smacked 49ers behind dominant defense\n\nThey are in sync with the pressure and coverage and just erased San Francisco's running game. Outside of some issues covering backs and tight ends, Seattle has no defensive weaknesses. They are starting to channel much of the classic \"Legion of Boom\" energy from their Super Bowl 48-winning team.\n\nThe Seahawks ran the ball on 50.6 percent of their offensive plays, No. 2 in the NFL behind only the Ravens. They were No. 7 in rushing yards per game, averaging 126.2 yards. With a blowout in the divisional round, Seattle rushed the ball at a 63.5 percent clip, producing 175 yards on 33 attempts, with Kenneth Walker III (116 yards, 3 TDs) carrying the load after Zach Charbonnet (knee) got hurt.\n\nWhen Seattle can run the ball at a high clip, it takes a lot of pressure off Sam Darnold in the passing game. With their offensive line getting great interior blocking, it's a tough rushing attack to stop.\n\nThe Seahawks' run blocking has been on point and Klint Kubiak has done well to keep the offense balanced so it maintains explosiveness, too.\n\nSam Darnold has responded in his reunion with Kubiak, playing well off the running game. It's wise to trust elite breakout wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba to make the big plays needed all the way through the end zone. Darnold has also hit on well-timed deep shots to other wideouts and made good use of his tight ends when called upon. Darnold has been fortunate to land in another QB-friendly system after his big season with Minnesota.\n\n1. Too little from the passing game\n\nDarnold is falling into the Trent Dilfer-Brad Johnson category of potential Super Bowl quarterbacks. He is more of a complementary strong supporter on a team led by defense and the running game. However, Darnold should be prepared to try to win another shootout in Seattle with Matthew Stafford after not needing to much to beat the 49ers.\n\nFor such a dominant team, the Seahawks were minus-3 in turnover margin during the regular season. They were second in the NFL with their 28 giveaways and Darnold threw 14 of Seattle's 15 interceptions. Although they crushed the 49ers in the turnover battle, 3-0, to reverse that trend, the Rams will be out looking for mistakes from Darnold.\n\nThe Seahawks were a middle of the pack offense on third down this season, converting on 39.8 percent of third-down chances. Seattle's third down struggles were highlighted in the divisional round, going 4-for-10 (40 percent) in the playoff rout of the 49ers. The Seahawks will need do better at sustaining drives or meet a playoff exit.\n\nThe Patriots' secondary was active and a big reason why they thwarted the Texans' makeshift receiving corps. C.J. Stroud saw some pressure, but his bad passes cost him because New England was opportunistic. New England also was all over ripping into Justin Herbert and his receivers in the wild-card round. The defense, not the offense, is why the Patriots remain alive, one game away from the Super Bowl.\n\nMaye got out of some his early playoff jitters and kinks against the Texans and Chargers, facing a lot more pressure in two senses and being less accurate and careful with the ball. But after a hot finish vs. Houston's brutal all-around defensive test with little help from the traditional running game, Maye should have a lot more confidence he can do what Josh Allen did in Denver to the Broncos' defense, only minus the turnovers.\n\nMORE: Why Patriots won't get away with sloppy Drake Maye vs. Bo Nix-less Broncos\n\nMike Vrabel and Josh McDaniels have proved to be strong Belichickian proxies for New England with Maye and the young defensive talent making their jobs much easier to execute at a high level. Vrabel has wasted no time returning to the ranks off top NFL coaches, picking up where left off with lesser teams in Tennessee.\n\nMaye has gotten sloppy with his ball security when running or keeping pass plays alive in the pocket. He has also thrown an interception in each of his first two playoff games, and luckily hasn't been picked off more with some anomalous inaccuracy. The Patriots must win the turnover battle all-around to win the war.\n\nMORE: Texans can't take advantage of Drake Maye's turnover troubles\n\nMaye is in Year 2. Everyone's adjusting to the Vrabel-McDaniels era after one bad transitional year with Jerod Mayo. There is some youth serving well on the defense despite its green nature. The Patriots are a facing a tight-nit Broncos' defense and would get either the swarming Seahawks or the savvier Sean McVay-led Rams in the Super Bowl.\n\nThe Patriots tend to give up touchdowns deep when their opponents can sustain long drives. They made the Texans look better in this major area of struggle on Sunday. Not holding for field goals on a couple drives can make the biggest difference for Maye and the offense moving forward.\n\nMcVay is the best coach in the NFL, considering his offensive play-calling acumen, motivational skills and situational understanding. He took advantage of a flawed field to push the team toward its first championship under him in Super Bowl 56. His offensive staff and defensive coordinator Chris Shula crush it every week, too.\n\nMORE: Why Sean McVay-Ben Johnson postgame handshake was cordial\n\n2. Matthew Stafford, Puka Nacua and Davante Adams\n\nStafford might have more chemistry with Nacua and Adams than he did with Cooper Kupp and his other receivers four years ago. Nacua is off to a historic start with his production and Adams' red zone dominance has further stamped his Hall of Fame career. Stafford has been on point getting them the ball and it's also opened up big plays downfield and after the catch for the tight ends and other receivers.\n\n3. A strong defensive front seven\n\nThe back end of the Rams' defense has had some coverage breakdowns at corner and safety, exploitable in several matchups. The Rams won their last Super Bowl with Aaron Donald as the linchpin and Jalen Ramsey as the mercenary. Now they've a rebuilt a stout disruptive corps with Jared Verse, Kobie Turner, Braden Fiske, Nate Landman and other active youngsters.\n\n1. Not running the ball enough or effectively\n\nThe Rams have a good rushing attack, especially in short yardage and in the red zone. They stuck with the run 31 times against the Bears, with Kyren Williams scoring both of their TDs. But they averaged only 3.6 yards a carry and couldn't put the game away with the rushing attack in the fourth quarter. They can't get afford to get stuck being too one-dimensional for Stafford's sake.\n\nThe Rams made some huge interceptions against Caleb Williams to help survive in the divisional round. But they also had some major coverage breakdowns and benefitted from a few just-missed connections and drops by the Bears receivers.\n\nMcVay tends to be old-school for still being a young hotshot calling the offensive shots at age 39. For example, he could have trusted Stafford and the passing game to run out the clock with one more first down in regulation, but invited the Bears back in with a late short punt. Some tougher fourth-down calls might be required to outlast the Seahawks plus either the Patriots or Broncos.\n\nSean Payton and defensive coordinator Vance Joseph have been on point, coaching complementary football. Payton has the experience of winning Super Bowl 44 while leading the Saints and will extract the most out of his now more injury-riddled roster one last time. That includes scheming to make backup Jarrett Stidham semi-successful filling in for Bo Nix.\n\nThe Broncos dodged a bullet with cornerback Patrick Surtain returning vs. the Bills. They also saw more playmakers come though in the secondary behind good pressure on Allen, led by Ja'Quan McMillan in the slot corner role. Nik Bonitto and others set Denver up for success against the Bills and should be ready to tee off against Drake Maye and the Patriots.\n\nWith Nix out for the season with a broken bone in his ankle, his early legacy of being a clutch late-game quarterback may rub off with the whole team. Expect Denver to rally around Stidham to come through in the end.\n\n1. No Bo Nix and more offensive injuries\n\nStidham will likely need to go to work minus wide receivers Pat Bryant and Troy Franklin, just as the young targets were starting to come through for Nix. Now Stidham is dealing with a short-handed receiving corps on top of being rusty and jittery playing against his first NFL team at home.\n\nMORE:Why Nick Foles thinks Broncos have a chance after Bo Nix injury\n\nThe Broncos didn't find a reliable rushing attack even against the Bills' porous run defense, with Nix's scrambling leading the way in the running game. The team misses the power and juice of JK Dobbins with rookie RJ Harvey providing only some flashes without power-running substance. If the Broncos can't take pressure off Stidham with the running game vs. a nasty Patriots run defense, Stidham should be prepared to see a lot of heat in his face.\n\nSurtain and McMillan saved the day in many ways against the Bills, but the Broncos are not known for making big plays on the ball with only 10 interceptions and four fumble recoveries from the regular season. They need to be sound fundamentally for Vance Joseph and win the situational battles on third down and in the red zone. Any little crack in coverage and Maye will exploit it for chunk passes downfield with his fearless, big arm.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nConference championship weekend will determine who reaches Super Bowl 60 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., on Feb. 8.\n\nDenver and Seattle advanced on divisional playoff weekend.\n\nThe Broncos will host the AFC championship game for the seventh time in franchise history, but the dominant storyline is the loss of Bo Nix, who suffered a broken bone in his right ankle in the 33-30 victory against Buffalo and will be replaced by Jarrett Stidham. New England beat Houston 28-16 in the AFC divisional playoffs behind second-year quarterback Drake Maye and a defense that forced four turnovers.\n\nDenver has beaten the New England Patriots in the AFC championship game in two past meetings.\n\nThe AFC championship game will be at 3 p.m. on CBS.\n\nThe Seahawks hammered the San Francisco 49ers 49-6 in the NFC divisional playoffs. Sam Darnold earned his first playoff victory, and Kenneth Walker III had three TD runs. The Rams survived a 20-17 overtime classic at Chicago in the NFC divisional round, and Matthew Stafford has a chance to get to a second Super Bowl with coach Sean McVay, who is looking for a third appearance.\n\nHere are Sporting News' picks for the AFC and NFC Championship games (odds courtesy of Caesars):\n\nNew England Patriots (-5.5) at Denver Broncos\n\nIt is a fun coaching matchup between Sean Payton and Mike Vrabel, who can take New England to the Super Bowl in his first season.\n\nStidham made two starts with coach Sean Payton in the 2023 season. How much will the Patriots speed up the seventh-year quarterback on his reads? Houston quarterback C.J. Stroud threw four interceptions and took three sacks. The Broncos will have to rely on the running game more – which averaged just 3.2 yards per carry against the Bills. RJ Harvey and Jaleel McLaughlin need to be more effective against a Patriots’ defense that allowed 48 rushing yards against the Texans. New England’s defense that features linebackers Robert Spillane and Christian Elliss.\n\nHow much will Stidham be able to test New England in the passing game? Carlton Davis - who did not have an interception in the regular season – had two picks. The Patriots will take chances in coverage on Stidham, and Denver also has uncertainty at the receiver position. Troy Franklin suffered a hamstring injury in the divisional playoffs, and that leaves Courtland Sutton, Marvin Mims and Lil’Jordan Humphrey at receiver. How much success will the Broncos have on third down in the intermediate range?\n\nBreaking down Broncos' QB depth chart behind Bo Nix\n\nCan the Broncos still win the Super Bowl without Bo Nix?\n\nGet to know new Broncos QB1, Jarrett Stidham\n\nDenver’s defense also will face more pressure to keep this a low-scoring game. Maye will be on the spot, too, especially in his first road playoff start. The Broncos generated five turnovers and three sacks against the Bills, and linebacker Nik Bonitto had a sack and two forced fumbles. There will be opportunities against Maye, who had four fumbles against the Texans, and the pressure has to land. The Patriots can lean on the running game with Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson, and that should help Maye settle in on the road.\n\nMaye has been trustworthy on the road this season, too. He’s 8-0 with an average 273.5 yards, 17 TDs and three interceptions on the road this season. This is Maye’s first start at Empower Field at Mile High, and the Broncos were 9-1 S/U at home this season and 2-0 S/U as a home underdog. It’s still a tough environment, and the Broncos are 6-1 S/U all time at home in the AFC championship game. Pittsburgh beat Denver 34-17 in the 2005 AFC championship game on Jan. 22, 2006.\n\nPatriots defense picks apart Texans to advance to AFC Championship\n\nC.J. Stroud's four first-half INTs doom Texans\n\nWhy Patriots can't afford another sloppy Drake Maye playoff performance\n\nWhere C.J. Stroud's disastrous day ranks among most turnovers in a playoff game\n\nCan Stidham pull a Jeff Hostettler – who led the Giants to a Super Bowl XXV victory after Phil Simms was injured. Hostettler had two regular-season starts before the playoffs. A week might not be enough time for Denver here. It’s just going to be tough to pull this off without the Patriots imploding on the road.\n\nLos Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (-2.5)\n\nThe two regular-season matchups were decided by a combined total of three points, including a wild 38-37 overtime thriller on Dec. 18. The NFC West rivals split the regular-season series, and three of the last four meetings at Seattle have gone into overtime.\n\nWalker is coming off a huge game, and he had 11 carries for 100 yards and a TD in the last meeting. The Rams allowed 160 rushing yards against the Bears, so Seattle can be patient with the two-headed rushing attack of Walker and Zach Charbonnet. Jared Verse has to be a difference maker off the edge for Los Angeles.\n\nThat should help Darnold – who finished 51 of 78 (65.4%) for an average of 274.5 yards, two TDs and six interceptions in the two regular-season meetings against the Rams. Jaxon Smith-Njigba had 17 catches for 201 yards and a TD in those two games, and that is the matchup Seattle needs to win consistently in the passing game. Five different Los Angeles players had interceptions in those games, and the Rams intercepted Caleb Williams three times in the divisional playoff win. Turnovers will be key here, especially on the road.\n\nHow swarming Seattle defense is peaking at right time\n\nWatch Rashid Shaheed take opening kickoff for TD\n\nThis is another opportunity for Stafford, who had a 57.1% completion percentage in those two meetings but also did not take a sack. He had 457 yards and three TDs in the last meeting. Will Seattle coach Michael Macdonald choose to dial up the pressure in order to take Stafford out of rhythm with receivers Puka Nacua and Davante Adams? Tight end Cody Parkinson had 10 carries for 90 yards and a TD in two playoff games, too. The Rams also will look to establish the running game with Kyren Williams and Blake Corum. The Seahawks allowed 5.3 yards per carry in their regular-season loss in the Rams and 3.2 yards per carry in the win.\n\nThe Rams were 4-5 S/U on the road, but they are 1-1 ATS as an underdog in the regular season, but they have won S/U as a road favorite each of the last two weeks. Seattle is 8-2 S/U and 6-4 ATS at home. The Seahawks are 3-0 S/U at home in the NFC championship game.\n\nIt's shaping up to be another instant classic between these rivals, but the Rams had a 16-point lead in the fourth quarter in that last meeting and they have survived two tough road games. Does Stafford have one more road victory in him? It's hard not to trust the MVP-caliber quarterback in this matchup.\n\nRams fend off Bears' comeback attempt to advance to NFC Championship\n\nCaleb Williams overtime interception dooms Bears\n\nWatch Caleb Williams uncork spectacular TD pass to Cole Kmet to force overtime",
