    "description": "The Cowboys were rumored to be part of the NFL's international games in 2026, and that has proven to be true.",
    "fullText": "In 2026, the Dallas Cowboys will be among the teams taking part in the NFL's international games.\n\nWith the thought that the Cowboys could head down under to Australia and even to Mexico after Jerry Jones made it clear he would be interested in such a move, Dallas now knows where it will be heading in 2026.\n\nIt will be the first time the Cowboys have played an international game since 2014, and coach Brian Schottenheimer's team is off to Rio de Janeiro in 2026.\n\nWe don't know who their opponents will be, but it will no doubt be a huge draw given the Cowboys are involved.\n\nAfter a failed 2025 season, the Cowboys will now look towards the 2026 season as one where they can mount a bounce-back and make the playoffs for the first time in three seasons.\n\nAnd playing in Brazil will certainly have its perks.\n\nMost of all, the marketing side, which we know Jerry and the Cowboys will eat up.\n\nSchottenheimer will lead his Cowboys to a place they've never played an NFL game before, nor the NFL, as Maracanã Stadium will host the game, with the previous outings in Brazil being played in São Paulo, so it will be another career first for the head coach.\n\nWhat is rather interesting about the Cowboys playing in Brazil is that, as we understand it, it will be a home game at AT&T Stadium, and so the franchise is giving up the revenue that goes with that.\n\nBut of course, there are riches to be mined internationally, too.\n\nReportedly, the Cowboys' potential opponents for the game are the Buccaneers, Titans, Jaguars, Niners, Cardinals, and Ravens.\n\nThat is, providing the NFL doesn't make it an NFC East showdown, which does seem highly unlikely, but you never know in the NFL.\n\nSo there will be a lot to monitor over the coming weeks and months, as the Cowboys go international for the first time in over a decade, with Schottenheimer's new-look Dallas team leading the way.\n\nThe Ravens loom as a good opponent for the Cowboys, as do the 49ers, but they are already heading to Australia to face the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nEither way, the Cowboys are going to be part of the international series, and that's exciting.",

    "description": "Aden Durde's journey to Sunday's Super Bowl is not just unusual, it's unique. The Briton's love of the NFL began with a 1986 video cassette - now he is coaching in sport's biggest game.",
    "fullText": "Aden Durde's journey to Sunday's Super Bowl is not just unusual, it's unique.\n\nAlthough he played professionally, he began his coaching career far from the NFL in the British amateur game with the London Warriors.\n\nYet he has blazed a trail all the way to the Super Bowl, breaking down barriers to become the first overseas coach to reach one of the biggest games in world sport.\n\nAs the Seattle Seahawks' defensive coordinator, one rung down from head coach, the 46-year-old has played a pivotal role in them getting to the NFL's title decider.\n\nSpeaking in California during the \"madness\" of Super Bowl week, the humble Briton has praised the youth coaches that \"changed his life\" by giving him a purpose.\n\nMeanwhile, many he met along the way have spoken of their pride at seeing his hard work pay off, such as Super Bowl winner Leslie Frazier, one of his colleagues on Seattle's coaching staff.\n\n\"He has been able to overcome so much in the course of his career,\" Frazier told BBC Sport. \"When I think about how he got started and where he is today, it just blows your mind. It's an incredible story.\"\n\nDurde and his older brother were raised by a single mother in north London, and it was a video she bought, of the Chicago Bears' 1986 Super Bowl-winning team, that inspired him to play American football.\n\nHe played youth football in Hayes, at Finsbury Park and then in south London, for the London Olympians and London Capitals.\n\nSome 30 years on, Durde's eyes light up at the mention of his first coach Geoff O'Driscoll. Durde followed him from team to team and O'Driscoll drove him across London twice a week, a two-hour trip each way, so that he could keep playing.\n\n\"Those people, that work as volunteers, they help kids from areas [where they] maybe don't have the funds to do something,\" said Durde. \"They literally change people's lives, and Geoff done that for me.\n\n\"Geoff, [long-time British coach] Tony Allen, those guys are pivotal in where I am [in the NFL], but also where I am as a man. I didn't have many male role models growing up and to see these guys helping people, not asking for credit, always turning up… it's huge.\"\n\nDurde was a team-mate of Tony's son Marvin Allen, and the pair have been close friends for 30 years. They both played in the now-defunct NFL Europe league and made it onto NFL practice squads.\n\nThey played against each other in Europe and for a while linebacker Durde had a picture of him tackling wide receiver Allen on his fridge.\n\n\"He was very tough and aggressive,\" said Allen. \"He was very smart in terms of how he diagnosed plays and watched film. He was very much a student of the game.\"\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\nWhich NFL team should you support?\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nAfter Durde ended his playing career, the father of two took charge of childcare while his wife Kate trained to be a midwife.\n\nHe then started a business helping children who were out of the education system and in 2011 became defensive coordinator of the London Warriors.\n\nYet he still found time to carry out extra voluntary work, mentoring children in north London. Durde was giving back before he'd even 'made it' himself.\n\n\"At first, it was nothing to do with professional coaching,\" he said. \"It was doing what other guys had done for me.\"\n\nAllen added: \"You end up being more than just a football coach, which I think Ad was for a lot of people. He'd provide them with an opportunity if he could, but it's also just steering them in the right direction.\n\n\"It's about making sure that those around you are also being nourished and enriched. He was really good at that.\"\n\nThose included Efe Obada, who grew up in foster care after being abandoned on the streets of London aged 10. When he attended a Warriors training session aged 22, Durde knew Obada could go beyond the amateur game.\n\nHe prepared him for an NFL try-out, with the pair training on public parks in London at 6am before doing their day job - Obada in a factory while Durde was now leading an NFL community programme.\n\n\"He was instrumental in my journey,\" said Obada, who played for seven seasons in the NFL. \"He invested his time outside of the game and poured into me.\"\n\nDurde was chaperoning a group of Warriors players on a trip to Texas when he got his big break.\n\nA contact from his time in NFL Europe told him to go buy a shirt as he'd secured him an interview with the Dallas Cowboys, who offered Durde an internship in 2014.\n\nThe Cowboys' head coach was Jason Garrett, who will work on Sunday's game as an analyst for US broadcaster NBC.\n\n\"I love him,\" he said. \"We were so fortunate, he made such a positive impression on everybody when he was there.\n\n\"He had this great balance of humility and wanted to learn from everybody, but also real strength in how he communicated and how he coached players.\n\n\"He had so much credibility because of how hard he worked and his knowledge. You weren't afraid at all to put him in situations where he's coaching players, because everybody respected him. I'm just so happy for him, he's an all-time great person.\"\n\nDurde helped Simon Buckett transition into coaching and the ex-Warriors player is now the team's general manager.\n\n\"He came back from Dallas and it was the same Aden, but with more ammunition, more knowledge of the game,\" said Buckett. \"His eyes had been opened.\n\n\"Myself and another coach would meet Aden every Tuesday and Thursday and he'd be tearing apart our next opponent, putting in new plays. We realised 'we're not going to have him very long, he's too good'.\"\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2026? Kick-off time, half-time show and BBC coverage\n\nHow much do you know about this year's Super Bowl?\n\nWhen Durde returned from further internships in 2015 and 2016 - with Dallas and the Atlanta Falcons - he continued to work for the NFL in London, sharing an office with two-time Super Bowl winner Osi Umenyiora.\n\nThe pair came up with the idea of a programme to help international athletes transition to the NFL, effectively an American football crash-course which became known as the International Player Pathway.\n\nDurde later ran the programme, which helped Obada get signed by the Carolina Panthers in 2017. Later that year Durde was the first American football coach to work-out ex-rugby league player Jordan Mailata.\n\nAs with Obada, Durde soon saw his potential and the Australian came through the programme before being drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018. He is now one of the NFL's best offensive tackles and won last year's Super Bowl.\n\n\"Jordan went from not knowing any of the position names to being drafted in four months,\" said Henry Hodgson, general manager of NFL UK & Ireland, who used to write a players' diary for Durde on the NFL Europe website.\n\n\"For Aden to have uploaded enough of his knowledge for someone to be drafted and go on to where he is now, that tells you what a great teacher he is.\"\n\nIt was then that Durde realised he could become an NFL coach.\n\n\"To do that from the UK is unprecedented because there isn't an obvious pathway,\" Hodgson added.\n\n\"The fact that Aden not only has done it, but has got to the level he's at now speaks to someone who is single minded, will figure stuff out for themselves and has the wherewithal to make something work if it's their passion or their dream.\"\n\nAllen always felt that Durde, who had two head-coach interviews last month, had \"the juice\" to become an NFL coach.\n\n\"He has the authenticity and the communication skills, and when you have that, you can conjure belief in people,\" he said.\n\n\"He's a very honest person and I think a lot of people buy into that, pretty much instantly.\"\n\nDurde became a full-time NFL coach with Atlanta in 2018, before returning to Dallas as their defensive line coach from 2021-2023.\n\nWhen Mike Macdonald, a defensive coach, took Seattle's top job in 2024, he made Durde his defensive coordinator.\n\nThe Seahawks narrowly missed out on the play-offs in their first season but in their second they had the NFL's joint-best record with the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots. They face the latter in Santa Clara on Sunday.\n\nNBC analyst Tony Dungy, who won the Super Bowl as a player and coach, said: \"[Durde's] done an outstanding job there, and I think when you watch their defence play, you see the energy, the excitement, but you also see discipline and a fundamentally sound team. So I think it's been fantastic, and I think the sky is the limit for him.\"\n\nThe Seahawks' defence allowed the fewest points during the regular season (17.2 per game) and although Durde stood out as a player for his physicality, he is calm and clear as a coach.\n\n\"This is their second year being around Ad and there's a marked difference in the way they play the game from a belief and confidence standpoint,\" said Allen.\n\n\"They're not just getting to the ball, they're believing that when they do, good things are going to happen. It's that 2% more that takes a team from just missing the play-offs to being a Super Bowl contender.\n\n\"There's definitely an imprint of Ad when I watch the Seahawks. It's like Star Wars, you can turn to the dark side and let it eat you up. But as a leader you have to refrain and keep your emotions [in check].\"\n\nLive text commentary from 21:30 on the BBC Sport website and app, and live radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds. Plus you can listen to 5 Live's preview show on Friday and watch The Whole 10 Yards on iPlayer.\n\nAs it happens, Durde's defence has become known as the Dark Side.\n\nThe Seattle defence that helped the Seahawks to their only Super Bowl win in 2014 is known as the Legion of Boom while the Chicago defence that inspired Durde in the 1980s is still regarded as arguably the best of all-time. Now his defence has earned its own nickname.\n\n\"I love it,\" he said. \"These guys push themselves not to replicate the Legion of Boom, but to live up to a standard, and now they're creating their own identity.\"\n\nSeattle's assistant head coach Frazier was a defensive back in the Bears' Super Bowl-winning team that captured the imagination of a youngster in north London. Exactly 40 years later, they could be lifting the Lombardi Trophy together.\n\n\"It's humbling for me to work with Aden, to know how much he admired what we did, how it influenced him, and to see where he is today,\" he said.\n\n\"I tease him all the time. I say, 'one day, there's going to be a book written about you. There's going to be a documentary about your life'. It's just a great story.\"\n\nBack in London, the Warriors plan to watch Sunday's big game together in Croydon, although Allen wants to make sure he can focus on the action at home.\n\n\"We're all very proud because what Aden's done has never been done before,\" he said. \"When you factor in how much of a minority sport it is in the UK, in particular when he was coming up, it's amazing. There's not many stories like it, in any sport.\n\n\"It would not surprise me at all if this ends up being the story we want it to be. It's legendary. And if he can win one Super Bowl, he's going to want more.\"\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "As the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots prepare for a high-stakes Super Bowl rematch at Levi’s Stadium, anytime touchdown props remain the most electric way to get skin in the game.\n\nWhether you’re banking on Kenneth Walker III to exploit a gap in the New England front or expecting Drake Maye to call his own number on a red-zone scramble, the anytime TD market allows you to turn every trip inside the 20 into a potential celebration.\n\nJoin us as we delve into this popular Super Bowl props market with odds, Super Bowl picks, and insightful TD trends.\n\nBettors have been banking big on Kenneth Walker III, who leads all players with four postseason touchdowns. That includes a sizzling three TD performance against the 49ers in which he ran for 116 yards on 19 carries.\n\nThe bruising back should continue to carry the load for the Seahawks, who will be without Zach Charbonnet, who sustained a season-ending ACL injury against San Francisco.\n\nLooking for extra value? Drake Maye's anytime TD odds have been boosted to +350 by our friends at BET99. You won't find a better price on this market in Canada.\n\nRhamondre Stevenson hasn't scored in the postseason yet, but he finished the regular season with at least one TD in three straight games, crossing the goal line a collective six times in those outings. Expect the Pats' RB1 to scamper into the end zone again on Sunday.\n\nRashid Shaheed is a home run threat and faces a man-heavy scheme from the Patriots, which also him to utilize his speed and seperation. Seattle is also using the WR in the running game with tricky handoffs. He has options on how to get inside the end zone.\n\nRead more of Jason's Super Bowl LX predictions and picks before game time.\n\nMack Hollins has been in and out of the lineup with injuries, but he logged more snaps during the AFC Conference Championship than any other New England Patriots wide receiver, signaling clear trust when he’s healthy. It’s a steep price, but one that makes sense for a receiver who should be competing for the team lead in targets.\n\nNot only is Drake Maye the only Patriot to score a rushing touchdown this postseason, but he's already logged 141 rushing yards on 24 carries against three elite defenses, including two games with double-digit attempts. Don't be surprised to see him call his own number when it matters most.\n\nElijah Arroyo is Josh's longshot Super Bowl TD pick. Although not a primary option, the Seahawks tight end is expected to see around 40% of the snaps and run roughly 30% of the routes.\n\nRead Josh's Super Bowl touchdown prop picks for even more analysis.\n\nJosh expects Stevenson to get all the work to the red zone, but Maye will take the ball over the threshold as the Seahawks have allowed just five RB rushing TDs this year. Shaheed, meanwhile, has breakaway speed and can contribute on both special teams and on offense, while Hollins' price is too long to not add for a +8500 monster moonshot.\n\nRead more of Josh's insights in his Seahawks vs. Patriots Predictions, Picks & Best Bets.\n\nAn anytime touchdown bet involves wagering on whether a specific player will score a touchdown at any point during the game, not just the first TD.\n\nFor example, if you bet on Patriots running back Rhamondre Stevenson to score an anytime touchdown and he finds the end zone at any time during the Super Bowl, you win the bet.\n\nThis type of bet is popular because it allows for more scoring opportunities, and you can often choose players based on advantageous matchups. The odds can vary based on the player’s scoring potential and the strength of the team’s offensive scheme.\n\nHere are some of the key factors oddsmakers consider when setting touchdown prop odds:\n\nPlayer performance: Historical data on a player's scoring ability, including past touchdowns, carries, and target share, is crucial.\n\nMatchup analysis: The opposing defense's strengths and weaknesses are evaluated, including how well they defend against specific positions.\n\nInjury reports: Injuries to key players can impact a player's likelihood of scoring. Check out our NFL Injuries page to stay up to date before making your wager.\n\nGame script: Oddsmakers consider potential game scenarios, such as whether a team is expected to be ahead or behind and how that may impact their strategy.\n\nPublic sentiment: Betting patterns and public perception can also sway odds. If a player is very popular or a big favorite, sportsbooks may adjust their odds to mitigate risk. You can check out our Covers NFL picks consensus to see how the public is leaning.\n\nThe Super Bowl has evolved into a pass-heavy spectacle, as seen in Super Bowl 59, where five of the seven total touchdowns were caught by wide receivers.\n\nThe table below tracks every anytime touchdown over the last decade of Super Bowls from Super Bowl 50 to Super Bowl 59.\n\nWRs have scored 50% of all TDs in the last 3 Super Bowls.\n\nOften all or nothing. Saquon Barkley had 25 carries but 0 TDs in SB 59.\n\nTravis Kelce has been the standard, but SB 59 saw a TE shutout.\n\nJalen Hurts holds the record with 4 career SB rushing TDs.\n\nCooper DeJean’s pick-6 in 2025 was the first since Super Bowl 50.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "description": "Aden Durde's journey to Sunday's Super Bowl is not just unusual, it's unique. The Briton's love of the NFL began with a 1986 video cassette - now he is coaching in sport's biggest game.",
    "fullText": "Aden Durde's journey to Sunday's Super Bowl is not just unusual, it's unique.\n\nAlthough he played professionally, he began his coaching career far from the NFL, playing in London's Finsbury Park in the British amateur game.\n\nYet he has blazed a trail all the way to the Super Bowl, breaking down barriers to become the first overseas coach to reach one of the biggest games in world sport.\n\nAs the Seattle Seahawks' defensive coordinator, one rung down from head coach, the 46-year-old has played a pivotal role in them getting to the NFL's title decider.\n\nSpeaking in California during the \"madness\" of Super Bowl week, the humble Briton has praised the youth coaches that \"changed his life\" by giving him a purpose.\n\nMeanwhile, many he met along the way have spoken of their pride at seeing his hard work pay off, such as Super Bowl winner Leslie Frazier, one of his colleagues on Seattle's coaching staff.\n\n\"He has been able to overcome so much in the course of his career,\" Frazier told BBC Sport. \"When I think about how he got started and where he is today, it just blows your mind. It's an incredible story.\"\n\nDurde and his older brother were raised by a single mother in north London, and it was a video she bought, of the Chicago Bears' 1986 Super Bowl-winning team, that inspired him to play American football.\n\nHe played youth football in Hayes, at Finsbury Park and then in south London, for the London Olympians and London Capitals.\n\nSome 30 years on, Durde's eyes light up at the mention of his first coach Geoff O'Driscoll. Durde followed him from team to team and O'Driscoll drove him across London twice a week, a two-hour trip each way, so that he could keep playing.\n\n\"Those people, that work as volunteers, they help kids from areas [where they] maybe don't have the funds to do something,\" said Durde. \"They literally change people's lives, and Geoff done that for me.\n\n\"Geoff, [long-time British coach] Tony Allen, those guys are pivotal in where I am [in the NFL], but also where I am as a man. I didn't have many male role models growing up and to see these guys helping people, not asking for credit, always turning up… it's huge.\"\n\nDurde was a team-mate of Tony's son Marvin Allen, and the pair have been close friends for 30 years. They both played in the now-defunct NFL Europe league and made it onto NFL practice squads.\n\nThey played against each other in Europe and for a while linebacker Durde had a picture of him tackling wide receiver Allen on his fridge.\n\n\"He was very tough and aggressive,\" said Allen. \"He was very smart in terms of how he diagnosed plays and watched film. He was very much a student of the game.\"\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\nWhich NFL team should you support?\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nAfter Durde ended his playing career, the father of two took charge of childcare while his wife Kate trained to be a midwife.\n\nHe then started a business helping children who were out of the education system and in 2011 became defensive coordinator of the London Warriors.\n\nYet he still found time to carry out extra voluntary work, mentoring children in north London. Durde was giving back before he'd even 'made it' himself.\n\n\"At first, it was nothing to do with professional coaching,\" he said. \"It was doing what other guys had done for me.\"\n\nAllen added: \"You end up being more than just a football coach, which I think Ad was for a lot of people. He'd provide them with an opportunity if he could, but it's also just steering them in the right direction.\n\n\"It's about making sure that those around you are also being nourished and enriched. He was really good at that.\"\n\nThose included Efe Obada, who grew up in foster care after being abandoned on the streets of London aged 10. When he attended a Warriors training session aged 22, Durde knew Obada could go beyond the amateur game.\n\nHe prepared him for an NFL try-out, with the pair training on public parks in London at 6am before doing their day job - Obada in a factory while Durde was now leading an NFL community programme.\n\n\"He was instrumental in my journey,\" said Obada, who played for seven seasons in the NFL. \"He invested his time outside of the game and poured into me.\"\n\nDurde was chaperoning a group of Warriors players on a trip to Texas when he got his big break.\n\nA contact from his time in NFL Europe told him to go buy a shirt as he'd secured him an interview with the Dallas Cowboys, who offered Durde an internship in 2014.\n\nThe Cowboys' head coach was Jason Garrett, who will work on Sunday's game as an analyst for US broadcaster NBC.\n\n\"I love him,\" he said. \"We were so fortunate, he made such a positive impression on everybody when he was there.\n\n\"He had this great balance of humility and wanted to learn from everybody, but also real strength in how he communicated and how he coached players.\n\n\"He had so much credibility because of how hard he worked and his knowledge. You weren't afraid at all to put him in situations where he's coaching players, because everybody respected him. I'm just so happy for him, he's an all-time great person.\"\n\nDurde helped Simon Buckett transition into coaching and the ex-Warriors player is now the team's general manager.\n\n\"He came back from Dallas and it was the same Aden, but with more ammunition, more knowledge of the game,\" said Buckett. \"His eyes had been opened.\n\n\"Myself and another coach would meet Aden every Tuesday and Thursday and he'd be tearing apart our next opponent, putting in new plays. We realised 'we're not going to have him very long, he's too good'.\"\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2026? Kick-off time, half-time show and BBC coverage\n\nHow much do you know about this year's Super Bowl?\n\nWhen Durde returned from further internships in 2015 and 2016 - with Dallas and the Atlanta Falcons - he continued to work for the NFL in London, sharing an office with two-time Super Bowl winner Osi Umenyiora.\n\nThe pair came up with the idea of a programme to help international athletes transition to the NFL, effectively an American football crash-course which became known as the International Player Pathway.\n\nDurde later ran the programme, which helped Obada get signed by the Carolina Panthers in 2017. Later that year Durde was the first American football coach to work-out ex-rugby league player Jordan Mailata.\n\nAs with Obada, Durde soon saw his potential and the Australian came through the programme before being drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018. He is now one of the NFL's best offensive tackles and won last year's Super Bowl.\n\n\"Jordan went from not knowing any of the position names to being drafted in four months,\" said Henry Hodgson, general manager of NFL UK & Ireland, who used to write a players' diary for Durde on the NFL Europe website.\n\n\"For Aden to have uploaded enough of his knowledge for someone to be drafted and go on to where he is now, that tells you what a great teacher he is.\"\n\nIt was then that Durde realised he could become an NFL coach.\n\n\"To do that from the UK is unprecedented because there isn't an obvious pathway,\" Hodgson added.\n\n\"The fact that Aden not only has done it, but has got to the level he's at now speaks to someone who is single minded, will figure stuff out for themselves and has the wherewithal to make something work if it's their passion or their dream.\"\n\nAllen always felt that Durde, who had two head-coach interviews last month, had \"the juice\" to become an NFL coach.\n\n\"He has the authenticity and the communication skills, and when you have that, you can conjure belief in people,\" he said.\n\n\"He's a very honest person and I think a lot of people buy into that, pretty much instantly.\"\n\nDurde became a full-time NFL coach with Atlanta in 2018, before returning to Dallas as their defensive line coach from 2021-2023.\n\nWhen Mike Macdonald, a defensive coach, took Seattle's top job in 2024, he made Durde his defensive coordinator.\n\nThe Seahawks narrowly missed out on the play-offs in their first season but in their second they had the NFL's joint-best record with the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots. They face the latter in Santa Clara on Sunday.\n\nNBC analyst Tony Dungy, who won the Super Bowl as a player and coach, said: \"[Durde's] done an outstanding job there, and I think when you watch their defence play, you see the energy, the excitement, but you also see discipline and a fundamentally sound team. So I think it's been fantastic, and I think the sky is the limit for him.\"\n\nThe Seahawks' defence allowed the fewest points during the regular season (17.2 per game) and although Durde stood out as a player for his physicality, he is calm and clear as a coach.\n\n\"This is their second year being around Ad and there's a marked difference in the way they play the game from a belief and confidence standpoint,\" said Allen.\n\n\"They're not just getting to the ball, they're believing that when they do, good things are going to happen. It's that 2% more that takes a team from just missing the play-offs to being a Super Bowl contender.\n\n\"There's definitely an imprint of Ad when I watch the Seahawks. It's like Star Wars, you can turn to the dark side and let it eat you up. But as a leader you have to refrain and keep your emotions [in check].\"\n\nAs it happens, Durde's defence has become known as the Dark Side.\n\nThe Seattle defence that helped the Seahawks to their only Super Bowl win in 2014 is known as the Legion of Boom while the Chicago defence that inspired Durde in the 1980s is still regarded as arguably the best of all-time. Now his defence has earned its own nickname.\n\n\"I love it,\" he said. \"These guys push themselves not to replicate the Legion of Boom, but to live up to a standard, and now they're creating their own identity.\"\n\nSeattle's assistant head coach Frazier was a defensive back in the Bears' Super Bowl-winning team that captured the imagination of a youngster in north London. Exactly 40 years later, they could be lifting the Lombardi Trophy together.\n\n\"It's humbling for me to work with Aden, to know how much he admired what we did, how it influenced him, and to see where he is today,\" he said.\n\n\"I tease him all the time. I say, 'one day, there's going to be a book written about you. There's going to be a documentary about your life'. It's just a great story.\"\n\nBack in London, the Warriors plan to watch Sunday's big game together in Croydon, although Allen wants to make sure he can focus on the action at home.\n\n\"We're all very proud because what Aden's done has never been done before,\" he said. \"When you factor in how much of a minority sport it is in the UK, in particular when he was coming up, it's amazing. There's not many stories like it, in any sport.\n\n\"It would not surprise me at all if this ends up being the story we want it to be. It's legendary. And if he can win one Super Bowl, he's going to want more.\"\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "The Senior Bowl was last week, and the Arizona Cardinals now have a new head coach. We can now begin to firmly look ahead toward the NFL draft.\n\nNFL.com's Bucky Brooks released a new mock draft of the first round.\n\nThe Cardinals have the third overall pick, and he has them going with an offensive lineman.\n\nThe Cardinals must determine if Kyler Murray remains the franchise quarterback. If his time in the desert is indeed done, as many have speculated, the lack of QB depth in the 2026 draft class could prompt the team to look elsewhere for help at the game's most important position. In this case, Arizona adds a foundational piece to its struggling offensive line, which contributed to a 38.7% pressure allowed rate -- the fourth-highest mark in the league in 2025, per Next Gen Stats.\n\nThis pick makes sense. The Cardinals need to figure out the quarterback situation, but they won't likely be selecting one in the first round. They have questions at as many as four starting spots on the offensive line, so landing Fano to lock down right tackle would be a great plan to pair with Paris Johnson.\n\nHowever, while the pick makes sense, it would mean breaking from a three-year trend. The Cardinals have only selected players from the SEC and Big Ten in the first and second rounds in three years with Monti Ossenfort as general manager.\n\nKnowing that, someone like linebacker Arvell Reese out of Ohio State makes sense, but he goes second overall in these projections.\n\nOssenfort obviously could break from his tradition, but it will be something to watch as we approach the draft in the mweeks to come.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs has made an impact on WR Kayshon Boutte this season.\n\nBoutte was available at Day 2 of Super Bowl week on Tuesday. He, along with several other players, in addition to coaches, spoke to the media with Super Bowl LX just days away. Boutte was asked about his missed connections with quarterback Drake Maye in the postseason, as well as his struggles on and off the field that he divulged with The Players’ Tribune, among other questions.\n\nPer Blitz Sports Media’s Ryan Linkletter, Boutte gave Diggs his just due when asked about the latter’s impression on the wide receiver room in New England.\n\n“I would say personally for my development, I felt like it was always good to have a great receiver come in. I felt like it always pushed me to be great,” Boutte said. “So I think that’s one thing I told myself in the offseason. Whatever he do, I’m going to match it. Just to try to get myself to where I want to be.”\n\nDiggs was signed by the Patriots after recording six 1,000-yard receiving seasons in six of the seven years before he arrived in New England. The two-time All-Pro receiver opened the field up for Boutte with the attention he garnered from opposing defenses.\n\nBoutte caught a career-high 71.7 percent of his passes in 2025 — up 8.5 percent from 2024 — with additional career-highs in yards per target (12), as well as yards per reception (16.7). Diggs distinguishably improved the three-year veteran’s potential for yardage this season. His work in the locker room paid dividends behind the scenes.\n\nBoth wide receivers look to put a stamp on their dynamic as the featured pass-catchers on the outside for New England with a win at Super Bowl LX on February 8.\n\nFollow Patriots Wire on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Patriots Wire: Kayshon Boutte: Stefon Diggs ‘pushed me to be great’ in 2025",

    "description": "Nakobe Dean's re-signing would be a no-brainer if a recent market value projection proves an accurate guess.",
    "fullText": "A crap shoot, an inexact science. For all of the time and energy that Philadelphia Eagles coaches and scouts put into player evaluations, that's how the NFL Draft is described. Simply put, regardless of how hard these guys work to dissect these NCAA prospects, there are no guarantees about what they will or won't become at the next level.\n\nTake Nakobe Dean, for example. He's one of the better recent examples of that. His final year with the Georgia Bulldogs was the stuff of legend. We saw him blitz and make plays in the open field. Heck, we saw him intercept a pass while covering a guy in the slot once.\n\nWhen his final season ended at UGA, he had won the Butkus Award and been named a Unanimous All-American. Oh, and by the way, he was part of a College Football Playoff National Championship-winning roster.\n\nThe NFL Draft came. Surely he'd be a first-round draftee. That's what we thought. He was invited to Las Vegas as one of the sure-fire first-round prospects. That's when adversity came. He slid to Round 3, and Philadelphia made him the 83rd-overall selection.\n\nThere were rumors of a concealed injury, the likely reason he wasn't taken as high as some thought he should have gone. His first year at football's highest level was spent largely with him playing on special teams.\n\nYear two ended with a trip to the Eagles' injured reserve. In year three, he took on an expanded role and played well, but he again landed on the IR. Year four was again a contract season. He again missed time due to injury. That brings questions as we are knee-deep into another offseason. The most obvious one is as follows.\n\nSpotrac shared his market value recently. They see a four-year deal worth $31,599,724 as being fair. That's an annual salary of $7,899,931. This deal would rank 326th among active players. Here are two questions.\n\nFirst, would Philadelphia be willing to keep him around for that price? Second, would that interfere with their ability to sign needed defensive talent later on? One has to hope that the answers to those questions are 'yes' and 'no'. A record-breaking salary cap figure is projected for the coming 2026 NFL season.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, the Eagles have an embarrassment of riches at the linebacker position. Zack Baun is as good a player as comes at the position. Philadelphia has Jeremiah Trotter Jr., Jihaad Campbell, and Smael Mondon all waiting in the wings.\n\nThat said, one could understand why Philadelphia would keep Dean around or let him walk. We'll see what happens, especially since they have to make other decisions about contributors, namely Dallas Goedert and Reed Blankenship.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: Nakobe Dean's projected price tag could make re-signing a no-brainer",

Some fans have gone so far as to say they will boycott the performance, while others are perfectly fine with the global music star taking the stage.\n\nMORE: Bad Bunny’s new Super Bowl 2026 trailer sends clear message ahead of halftime show\n\nKevin Durant, however, falls into a different category altogether. The longtime NBA veteran recently spoke candidly about Bad Bunny and his music, offering a personal perspective as the Super Bowl LX halftime show approaches.\n\nDurant appeared on Kay Adams’ Up and Adams podcast on Wednesday, where he shared that he has not listened to any of Bad Bunny’s songs. When the former NFL Network reporter asked Durant, “I want to know how you’re doing?” he replied, “Doing better. We’ll see in the morning.” Later, when Adams said, “Well enough to like to dance to Bad Bunny, [Super Bowl] halftime?” Durant simply confessed, “I haven’t listened to Bad Bunny before.”\n\nKay Adams: \"I want to know how you're doing?\"\n\nKevin Durant: \"Doing better.

His albums, including ‘YHLQMDLG’, ‘El Último Tour del Mundo’, and ‘Un Verano Sin Ti’, were huge hits. His ‘Un Verano Sin Ti’ especially made history because a Spanish-language album became one of the most popular in the United States and worldwide.\n\nBut some NFL fans are unhappy about Bad Bunny performing at the Super Bowl. He has been outspoken on social and political issues, especially about U.S. immigration policies and ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement).\n\nHe made a high-profile speech at the 2026 Grammys condemning ICE actions and calling for empathy toward immigrants, which upset many conservative viewers. These critics see him as too political and say his views don’t fit a traditionally neutral sports event.\n\nNFL: Ranking the greatest Super Bowl quarterback performances\n\nNBA: Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo’s mom hints at next NBA team\n\nMLB: Mets sign former Dodgers World Series champion\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: Mattress Mack reveals massive $2 million Super Bowl 60 wager\n\nENTERTAINMENT: WWE star calls Pat McAfee to reveal shocking 2026 Royal Rumble return\n\nVIRAL: Kendall Jenner halts interview for Tom Brady Super Bowl 60 prediction on FaceTime\n\nThe post Kevin Durant stuns NFL world with honest Bad Bunny confession ahead of Super Bowl halftime show appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump will not be attending the Super Bowl after being warned he would likely be resoundingly booed by the crowd inside the stadium, according to a report.\n\nThe thin-skinned president had previously offered the unlikely excuse that he would not attend the NFL championship game between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots on Sunday in Santa Clara, California, because it was “too far away” and because he disliked the planned performers, Bad Bunny and Green Day.\n\nHowever, several of Trump’s advisers have now told Zeteo that the 79-year-old was urged not to attend the game in the deep-blue Democratic state because he would likely receive a less-than-friendly reception.\n\nClips of Trump being loudly booed in front of tens of thousands of spectators—and potentially more than 100 million viewers at home—going viral would be “another thing we don’t want right now,” one Trump adviser told Zeteo.\n\nTrump was met with a mixture of boos and cheers when he attended last year’s Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nBut since then his approval ratings have plummeted across the board, with the president losing support over his handling of the economy and his hardline immigration policies, particularly in the wake of the killing of two U.S. citizens by federal agents in Minneapolis.\n\nTrump’s dire polling numbers, combined with the Super Bowl being held in a state that has overwhelmingly rejected him in the past three presidential elections, led one aide to conclude it was “best to stay away from this one.”\n\n“Whatever [the crowd’s makeup] ends up being, it’s not gonna be a Turning Point USA speech,” the aide said.\n\nTrump told the New York Post last month that he would skip this year’s Super Bowl because he was unhappy that Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny would be performing the halftime show. Veteran punk rockers Green Day, who are also vocal critics of the president, are performing at the Super Bowl opening ceremony.\n\n“I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible,” Trump said.\n\nTurning Point USA announced that MAGA country singer Kid Rock will headline its “All American Halftime Show,” scheduled to take place at the same time as the official halftime performance from Latin superstar Bad Bunny, who predominantly sings in Spanish.\n\nTrump also offered the dubious explanation that he was unwilling to travel to California because it was “just too far away,” despite regularly flying around the world and having attended last year’s Super Bowl in New Orleans.\n\nHe told the New York Post that he would be welcomed by the crowd if he dared to go. “They like me,” he said.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Davis Ingle insisted that Trump would receive a warm welcome if he attended Super Bowl LX in person.\n\n“President Trump is working hard on behalf of the American people,” Ingle told Zeteo. “If he did attend the Super Bowl, he would receive a warm welcome because America knows he has done more to help this country than any other president in history.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.",

    "description": "Here's everything you need to know about the NFL's team owners, including Robert Kraft, Jody Allen, Jerry Jones, Clark Hunt, and Jeffrey Lurie.",
    "fullText": "On Sunday, one billionaire family will walk away from the Big Game a few dividends richer.\n\nWhile fans are focused on the matchup between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots, the owners of both teams have their own stakes in the outcome, with billions in franchise value on the line.\n\nThe NFL is one of the biggest businesses in the world, accounting for 30 of Forbes' top 50 sporting franchises of 2025.\n\nAnd while star players and coaches are certainly deserving of credit for that fact, it's often the owners who are responsible for the key decisions made by their franchise.\n\nKansas City Chiefs co-owner and CEO Clark Hunt, for example, hired head coach Andy Reid in 2013; the Chiefs have since appeared in five Super Bowls, winning three.\n\nOwners aren't only judged by their fanbases, though; they're judged by the players, too. Last year, the NFL Players Association released its third annual club report cards, based on a survey completed by 1,695 active players.\n\nOne of the categories players were surveyed about was ownership, which was graded based on how willing players believe an owner is to invest in the team's facilities, how much they contribute to a positive team culture, and how committed they are to building a competitive team. Each owner was given a letter grade ranging from an F- (0-49) to an A+ (97-100), which are included below.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the NFL's team owners, from how they acquired their team, to their NFLPA grade, to how the team's performed during their tenure.\n\nAll owner net worths were accurate as of February 3, 2026.\n\nMichael Bidwill is a third-generation owner of the Arizona Cardinals, inheriting the team after his father, Bill Bidwill, died in 2019. Forbes estimated in 2015 that the family's net worth was $1.4 billion.\n\nThe Cardinals were originally purchased by Michael Bidwill's grandfather, Charles, in 1933 for $50,000 — now, they're worth $5.5 billion, ranking as the 45th most valuable sports team in the world, per Forbes.\n\nUnder Michael Bidwill's leadership, the team has made just one wild-card playoff appearance, which they lost in 2021, and he was given a D- by the NFL Players' Association; the report said players feel that he \"only slightly contributes to a positive team culture\" and \"is somewhat committed to building a competitive team.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a November 2023 investigation by ESPN detailed a number of workplace misconduct allegations from current and former Cardinals employees. Bidwill told the outlet in a statement that the team has \"worked hard over the last several years to improve our culture across the board,\" adding, \"We have more to do and, as I have said to every member of the Cardinals organization, that includes my own work to grow and improve as a leader.\"\n\nThe Cardinals did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nHome Depot cofounder Arthur Blank, who Forbes estimates is worth $11.1 billion, purchased the Atlanta Falcons in 2002 for $545 million, famously writing the agreement on a cloth napkin during a December 2001 meeting with seller Taylor Smith. The sale was finalized just a couple of months later in February 2002.\n\nUnder Blank's leadership, the Falcons have had nine winning seasons, including eight playoff berths and a Super Bowl LI appearance in 2017. Blank also built Mercedes-Benz Stadium and was named the 2021 Sports Philanthropist of the Year by ESPN. He was given an A+ ranking by the NFLPA.\n\nPer Forbes, the Falcons are the 29th-most-valuable sports team in the world, worth $6.35 billion.\n\nAt 65, Allegis Group founder Steve Bisciotti, who Forbes estimates has a net worth of $8.5 billion, is one of the youngest owners in the NFL. He bought a minority stake from the previous owner, Art Modell, in 2000 and completed his purchase in April 2004, spending a total of $600 million, ESPN reported at the time.\n\n\"We're proud of what we're giving to Baltimore. You have to make the playoffs to have the opportunity to compete for championships, and championships are our goal. We want to be a consistent winner that avoids big lulls and not being in the playoffs for any length of time,\" Bisciotti has said.\n\nThe Ravens have won two Super Bowls under Bisciotti (2000 and 2012) and are consistently competitive, posting one of the strongest postseason records in the NFL under Bisciotti's ownership.\n\nForbes valued the team at $6.1 billion, ranking it 33rd most valuable in the world. Bisciotti received an A rating from the NFLPA.\n\nIn October 2014, energy billionaire Terry Pegula, now estimated to have a net worth of $9.3 billion, purchased the Buffalo Bills with his wife, Kim Pegula, for $1.4 billion in cash, outbidding the likes of Donald Trump and Jon Bon Jovi.\n\nIn December 2024, Terry Pegula and the Bills added 10 limited partners to the team's ownership group, described as \"non-controlling, minority interests.\" Some of these partners include former US National Team soccer player Jozy Altidore and former NBA players Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady.\n\nThe diversification of ownership came after Kim Pegula was declared legally incapacitated in March 2023 following a brain injury sustained during cardiac arrest in June 2022. Kim Pegula is still listed as a co-owner by the Bills organization, but her duties as president have been assumed by Terry Pegula, who maintains the titles of co-owner, CEO, and president.\n\nDuring the Pegulas' tenure, the Bills have become a formidable team, with eight playoff appearances, including the 2020 AFC Championship. The Pegulas also own the Buffalo Sabres in the NHL.\n\nForbes reported that the Bills are worth $5.95 billion, ranking them 37th among the world's most valuable sports teams. Pegula was given a B in ownership by the NFLPA.\n\nTerry and Kim Pegula are the parents of WTA No. 6 player Jessica Pegula.\n\nBillionaire hedge fund manager and philanthropist David Tepper purchased the Carolina Panthers in 2018 for $2.275 billion, ESPN reported. Tepper has an estimated net worth of $23.7 billion, according to Forbes.\n\n\"I am thrilled to begin this new era of Carolina Panthers football and am humbled by the overwhelming excitement and support for the team,\" Tepper said at the time.\n\nUnder his ownership, the Panthers endured several losing seasons and missed the playoffs through 2024. In the 2025 season, Carolina finished 8-9, won the NFC South, and made its first playoff appearance since 2017.\n\nThe team is valued at $5.7 billion, making it the 40th-most-valuable team in the world, tied with the NBA's Miami Heat, according to Forbes.\n\nTepper was given a D- in ownership by the NFLPA; in the report card, players expressed frustration over the stadium's use of synthetic turf rather than natural grass. Players also said Tepper \"only slightly contributes to a positive team culture\" and is \"only somewhat committed to building a competitive team.\"\n\nThe Panthers did not respond to Business Insider's previous request for comment.\n\nIn February 2025, the Chicago Bears announced the team's longtime principal owner, Virginia Halas McCaskey, had died at age 102.\n\nHer son, George McCaskey, has served as the team's chairman since 2011, following the death of his brother, Michael McCaskey, and continues to serve in that role.\n\nHalas McCaskey had been the oldest and longest-tenured team owner in the NFL, having inherited the team in 1983 after her father, Hall of Famer and Bears founder George Halas Sr., died.\n\nUnder her ownership, Halas McCaskey saw the Bears reach four NFC Championship Games and two Super Bowls, including a win in 1986. The team has struggled in recent years, finishing the 2024 season 5-12, but they had a stronger season this year, finishing with an 11-6 record and winning their first playoff game in 15 years.\n\nThe McCaskey family was awarded an A- in ownership by the NFLPA.\n\nIn 2015, Forbes estimated the McCaskey family had a net worth of $1.3 billion, and the team, which is worth $8.2 billion today, was reported to be the 10th most valuable sports team in the world in a tie with the MLB's New York Yankees.\n\nMike Brown inherited the Cincinnati Bengals in 1991 after the death of his father, Hall of Fame coach Paul Brown.\n\nPaul Brown founded the Bengals in 1967 after cofounding and coaching the Cleveland Browns (who, yes, bear his name) for more than a decade.\n\nIn 2011, the Brown family purchased the remaining 30% of the team they didn't own for $200 million in cash, becoming the sole owners of the Bengals, the NFL reported, citing Forbes. Mike Brown and his family have an estimated net worth of $5 billion.\n\nMike Brown is the Bengals' principal owner and team president. After decades of struggle, the Bengals found success in recent years thanks in part to quarterback Joe Burrow and wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase, who led the team to Super Bowl LVI in 2021, losing 23-20 to the LA Rams.\n\nMike Brown received a C ownership rating from the NFLPA.\n\nFormer Pilot Company CEO Jimmy Haslam and his wife, Dee Haslam, purchased a 70% stake in the Cleveland Browns from Randy Lerner in 2012 for $1 billion. Jimmy Haslam has an estimated net worth of $8.7 billion, per Forbes.\n\nSince the Haslams took over, the Browns have had just two winning seasons, in 2020 and 2023.\n\nThey were given a C+ ownership rating by the NFLPA and, per Forbes, the team is worth $6.4 billion, making it the 28th most valuable franchise in the world.\n\nJerry Jones is the man behind the most valuable sports franchise in the world — the Dallas Cowboys — worth $13 billion, per Forbes.\n\nThat's more than 90 times what Jones paid for the team in 1989. (He paid H.R. Bright $140 million.) He and his family now have an estimated net worth of $20.8 billion, per Forbes.\n\nIn the decades that followed, the Cowboys won three Super Bowls (1992, 1993, and 1995), but they haven't made it beyond the divisional round of the playoffs since.\n\nJones was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017 — the 15th owner to receive such an award — and was given a B in ownership by the NFLPA in 2025.\n\nIn August 2022, the Walton-Penner Family Ownership Group purchased the Denver Broncos from the Pat Bowlen Trust for $4.65 billion, the NFL reported.\n\nThe controlling ownership designation was transferred from Rob Walton — heir to the Walmart fortune — to his son-in-law, Broncos CEO Greg Penner (who's married to Carrie Walton Penner), in October 2023. Rob Walton and his family have an estimated net worth of $142.5 billion, per Forbes.\n\nPenner oversaw the hiring of Broncos head coach Sean Payton, who, alongside rookie quarterback Bo Nix, took the team to its first playoff game since its Super-Bowl-winning 2016 season.\n\nThe Broncos are tied with the Los Angeles Dodgers for the 18th-most-valuable sports team in the world, with a reported value of $6.8 billion.\n\nThe Walton-Penner family was given an A ownership ranking by the NFLPA.\n\nSheila Ford Hamp became the principal owner and chair of the Detroit Lions in June 2020, after inheriting the team from her mother, Martha Firestone Ford.\n\nFirestone Ford had previously taken over the team in 2014 after the death of her husband, Bill Ford Sr., who'd purchased the Lions in 1963 for $6 million. In 2015, Forbes estimated the Ford family had a net worth of $2 billion.\n\nUnder Sheila Ford Hamp's leadership, the Lions have entered an unprecedented era of success, thanks in large part to her hires, GM Brad Holmes and head coach Dan Campbell.\n\nThe Lions, valued at $5.4 billion, ranked 48th among the world's most valuable sports franchises in 2025.\n\nSheila Ford Hamp received a B+ in ownership from the NFLPA in February 2025.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers are the only publicly owned team in the NFL.\n\nFans have owned the franchise for more than a century, and there have only been six stock offerings, the most recent being in 2021, with stocks worth $300. Per the Packers, the franchise is owned by more than 539,000 people who own more than 5.2 million shares.\n\nThe Packers are the 23rd most valuable sports team in the world, worth $6.65 billion, according to Forbes, and they were given an A- in ownership by the NFLPA.\n\nAnd if you're wondering how the team is actually run: It's governed by an unpaid board of directors and a seven-member executive committee.\n\nIn 1999, the Houston Texans were founded by Janice and Bob McNair. When Bob McNair died in 2018, ownership was transferred to Janice. Then, in March 2024, it was transferred to their son, Cal McNair, via a vote. Per Forbes, Janice McNair and the family have an estimated net worth of $7.3 billion.\n\nCal McNair had already been serving as the team's chair and CEO since July 2018 and January 2019, respectively.\n\nThe Texans finished the 2025 regular season 12-5 and defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 30-6 in the wild-card round of the playoffs before losing to the New England Patriots in the divisional round.\n\nForbes reported that the Texans are the 17th most valuable sports franchise in the world, worth $7.4 billion. Cal McNair was given an A ownership rating by the NFLPA in 2025.\n\nSince June 2025, the Indianapolis Colts have been owned by Jim Irsay's daughters — Carlie Irsay-Gordon, Casey Foyt, and Kalen Jackson — following the longtime owner's passing in May 2025.\n\nCarlie Irsay-Gordon is the team's principal owner and CEO. Like her father, Irsay-Gordon worked her way through multiple areas of the Colts organization, like marketing, community relations, and football operations, before becoming CEO.\n\nTheir grandfather, Robert Irsay, originally purchased the team — then known as the Baltimore Colts — in 1972 for $12 million. He moved the team to Indianapolis in 1984.\n\nIn 1997, his son, Jim Irsay inherited the team at just 37 years old. He served as the team's principal owner, chairman, and CEO during his life, and had an estimated net worth of $4.8 billion at his time of death.\n\nUnder Jim Irsay's leadership, the Colts won 10 division titles and made two Super Bowl appearances, including a win in 2007.\n\nThe Colts are the 38th most valuable sports franchise in the world, in a tie with the Houston Rockets, worth $5.9 billion, and Irsay was given a B in ownership by the NFLPA in 2025.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs have been owned by the Hunt family since the beginning. Lamar Hunt Sr. founded the team in 1959 as the Dallas Texans, and the team was moved to Kansas City in 1963. After Lamar Hunt Sr.'s death in 2006, ownership was divided between his wife, Norma, and their four children: Clark Hunt, Sharron Hunt Munson, Daniel Hunt, and Lamar Hunt Jr. As of 2024, the family has an estimated net worth of $24.8 billion, per Forbes.\n\nClark Hunt (pictured above with his wife and children) became the team's CEO in 2010 and has since been responsible for team decisions, including the hiring of head coach Andy Reid in 2013.\n\nReid has since become the winningest head coach in franchise history with three Super Bowl victories alongside quarterback Patrick Mahomes.\n\nForbes ranked the Chiefs, worth $6.2 billion, as the 32nd most valuable franchise in sports.\n\nClark Hunt's ownership rating rose from an F- in 2024 to a C- in 2025; in the report card, players said they feel he \"moderately contributes to a positive team culture\" and \"is committed to building a competitive team.\"\n\nMark Davis, who has an estimated net worth of $2.5 billion, inherited the Las Vegas Raiders (then the Oakland Raiders) in 2011 after the death of his father, Al Davis.\n\nAl Davis originally purchased a 10% stake in the team in 1966 for $18,500 and increased his ownership to 67% before his death.\n\nIn October 2024, Mark Davis expanded the team's ownership, selling 5% to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, 5% to Knighthead Capital Management cofounder Tom Wagner, and 0.5% to former NFL defensive lineman Richard Seymour.\n\nThe following month, Davis agreed to sell an additional 15% of the franchise, with equal stakes going to Silver Lake co-CEO and Endeavor board chairman Egon Durban and Discovery Land Company founder and chairman Michael Meldman.\n\nDespite the changes, Davis remains the team's principal owner and was given an A rating by the NFLPA in February 2025. The Raiders are reportedly worth $7.7 billion, making them the 13th-most-valuable sports team in the world.\n\nIn 2018, Dean Spanos became the principal owner of the Los Angeles Chargers (previously the San Diego Chargers) after the death of his father, Alex Spanos.\n\nThe elder Spanos had owned the team since 1984, after purchasing a 60% stake for $70 million, ESPN reported. He went on to buy out minority owners' shares to own 97% of the team, which was passed on to his four children. In 2018, the Spanos family had an estimated net worth of $2.4 billion.\n\nDean Spanos took over daily operations as team president in 1994, and has passed along day-to-day duties to his sons, AG and John Spanos, who now work as president of business operations and president of football operations, respectively.\n\nIn October 2024, billionaire Tom Gores purchased a 27% stake in the team for $750 million.\n\nThe Chargers are tied with the Chicago Bulls and Mercedes (F1) as the 34th most valuable sports franchise in the world, worth $6 billion.\n\nSpanos' NFLPA ownership ranking improved from a C+ in 2024 to an A in 2025. In the latest report card, Spanos was given a 9.6/10 rating for his \"perceived willingness to invest in the facilities\"; players also said he \"significantly contributes to a positive team culture\" and is \"extremely committed to building a competitive team.\"\n\nIn August 2010, Stan Kroenke paid $750 million to become the principal owner of the St. Louis Rams. He had previously been a minority owner of the team, purchasing a 30% stake in 1995 and increasing it to 40% stake by 1997.\n\nIn 2016, fellow NFL owners approved Kroenke's proposal to move the Rams back to Los Angeles, and in 2021, he opened SoFi Stadium, home to both the Rams and the Chargers.\n\nThe LA Rams are worth $10.5 billion, according to Forbes, making them the third most valuable team in sports, behind the Dallas Cowboys and the Golden State Warriors, while Kroenke himself has an estimated net worth of $21.3 billion.\n\n\"Stan has the vision, resources, inspiration and creativity to create the right setting for the NFL in Los Angeles,\" Jerry Jones has said, calling him \"a valuable asset to the National Football League.\"\n\nSince 2010, the Rams have made seven playoff appearances, all under head coach Sean McVay. The Rams won the Super Bowl in 2022 at home at SoFi, becoming just the second team to win the Super Bowl at home.\n\nKroenke was given a C ownership rating by the NFLPA.\n\nHe also owns Premier League team Arsenal FC.\n\nIn January 2009, billionaire Stephen M. Ross completed his purchase of the Miami Dolphins for a total of $1 billion. Ross had initially purchased a 50% stake in the franchise in February 2008 for $550 million, and the following January, he purchased an additional 45 percent of the team, leaving 5% to previous owner Wayne Huizenga, ESPN reported.\n\nAfter his 2009 purchase, Ross said, \"That is the most important thing, and the thing that drives me — creating and being part of a winning organization. There is nothing more important than that.\"\n\nToday, Ross is the chairman of the board, managing general partner, and owner of the team, which is worth a reported $7.5 billion, making it the 15th most valuable franchise in sports in a tie with the Los Angeles Clippers. Ross has an estimated net worth of $17 billion.\n\nThe Dolphins were the highest-ranked team in the league by the NFLPA, earning an A or A+ in all categories, including treatment of families, the locker room, weight room, training staff, head coach, and ownership. Ross himself earned an A+ ranking, one of only three owners to receive such high praise.\n\nIn June 2005, Red McCombs sold the Minnesota Vikings to brothers Zygi and Mark Wilf, their cousin Lenny Wilf, and their co-investors for $600 million. Zygi Wilf is widely reported to have an estimated net worth of $1.3 billion, although it hasn't been reported by Forbes.\n\nToday, Zygi Wilf is the chairman and control owner of the team, though the trio's individual stakes have never been divulged, Sport Business Journal reported.\n\nThe Vikings ranked as the second-best team in the NFL, according to the NFLPA's 2025 report cards, earning A+ marks in ownership, head coach, locker room, and treatment of families.\n\nUnder the Wilfs' ownership, the team opened US Bank Stadium in 2016 — the largest construction project in Minnesota's history — and has made multiple playoff appearances, though the Vikings haven't reached the Super Bowl since 1976.\n\nThe Vikings are the 31st most valuable team in sports, worth $6.25 billion, per Forbes.\n\nRobert Kraft is one of the best-known owners in the league. He purchased the New England Patriots in 1994 for $172 million and now has an estimated net worth of $13.8 billion.\n\nThrough the purchase, Kraft became the team's chairman and CEO, and he pledged \"to help bring a championship to New England.\"\n\nMore than 30 years later, the Patriots have become one of the most successful teams in NFL history with six Super Bowl victories from 10 appearances. This year, they're going for a record seventh win.\n\nPer Forbes, the Patriots are worth $9 billion — more than 52 times what Kraft bought the team for.\n\nHe received a D ownership ranking from the NFLPA. On the report card, Kraft was rated 6.15/10 for his \"perceived willingness to invest in the facilities,\" and players said he \"slightly contributes to a positive team culture\" and \"is somewhat committed to building a competitive team.\" Kraft announced that a new, $50 million training facility is expected to open this year.\n\nThe Patriots did not previously respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIn 2018, Gayle Benson inherited the New Orleans Saints from her husband, Tom Benson, after his death. She has an estimated net worth of $7.9 billion, Forbes reported.\n\nTom Benson had previously purchased the team in 1985 for about $70 million.\n\nIn 2021, Gayle Benson told The Times-Picayune that after her death, the succession plan is to sell the Saints and the NBA's New Orleans Pelicans (which she also owns) to a buyer who promises to keep the teams in New Orleans and donate all the proceeds to charities.\n\n\"When Tom bought this team, he didn't have a lot of money. Everything that he had, had to be given to keep the team. He worked really hard to get the Pelicans here. He sacrificed a lot. I want to make sure that we keep the teams here. I want them to stay in New Orleans forever,\" Benson said.\n\nBenson was given an A ranking in ownership by the NFLPA. The Saints, worth $5.3 billion, did not make Forbes' list of 50 most valuable sports teams in 2025, but it ranks 31st most valuable out of all 32 NFL teams.\n\nThe New York Giants were founded in 1925 by Tim Mara and have been part of the Mara family ever since.\n\nTeam ownership was passed to Tim's sons, Jack and Wellington Mara, in 1959, and now the team is run by principal owner, CEO, and president John Mara, who took over in 2005 after his father, Wellington's, death. John Mara had been with the organization since 1991.\n\nHowever, while John Mara is listed as the team's principal owner, he's actually shared ownership with Steve Tisch since 2005.\n\nSteve Tisch's father, Preston Robert Tisch, purchased a 50% stake in the Giants in 1991, and after his death, Steve became chairman and executive vice president.\n\nTogether, Mara and Tisch helped plan and build MetLife Stadium, and the team has won two Super Bowls (2008 and 2012) under their leadership. However, the team has struggled in recent years, winning just four games last season.\n\nStill, the Giants are the fourth most valuable team in sports, worth $10.1 billion. Tisch has an estimated net worth of $1.6 billion, Forbes reported, while Mara reportedly has an estimated net worth of $500 million.\n\nTisch was not named in the 2025 report card; Mara was given a C+ ownership ranking by the NFLPA.\n\nWoody Johnson — of Johnson & Johnson lineage — purchased the New York Jets in 2000 for $635 million. Forbes estimated in 2024 that the Johnson family had a net worth of $16 billion.\n\nThe Jets have struggled under his leadership, having failed to make the playoffs for the past 15 seasons. Johnson was also accused of letting his teenage sons, Brick and Jack, make decisions for the organization, as reported by The Athletic and ESPN's Rich Cimini in 2024.\n\nJohnson denied those claims in a January 2025 interview with the New York Post, telling the outlet they were \"unsubstantiated\" and that his son Brick \"has no role in the organization.\" Johnson added, \"When you're losing games, it gives people the artistic license to kind of do what they want.\"\n\nWhen reached by Business Insider for a comment in January 2025, a representative for the Jets shared the earlier comments made to the New York Post.\n\nThe Jets finished the 2025 season 3-14 and will be looking to greatly improve under new head coach Aaron Glenn and new GM Darren Mougey, and without quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who was released by the team in February 2025.\n\nJohnson's ownership ranking declined from a B- in 2024 to an F in 2025. In the report card, players said they feel he \"does not contribute to a positive team culture\" and is \"somewhat committed to building a competitive team.\" The Jets declined to comment on the rating when reached by Business Insider.\n\nStill, the team is considered the 12th most valuable franchise in sports, worth $8.1 billion, per Forbes.\n\nBusinessman Jeffrey Lurie purchased the Philadelphia Eagles in 1994 for $185 million. He now serves as the team's chairman and CEO, and he and his family have an estimated net worth of $7.6 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Eagles have made the playoffs numerous times and won two of their four Super Bowl appearances.\n\nLurie received a B ranking from the NFLPA, and the team is worth $8.3 billion, per Forbes, making it the ninth-most-valuable franchise in sports.\n\nSimilar to the Mara family and the Giants, the Pittsburgh Steelers have been part of the Rooney family since 1933, when the team was founded by Art Rooney. He remained the team's chairman until his death in 1988.\n\nAfter his death, his son Dan Rooney took over ownership until his death in 2017.\n\nNow, Dan's son, Art Rooney II, is responsible for most of the franchise's stake. However, he's been an active member of the organization since 1989, when he was first on the team's board of directors. He was named president of the Steelers in 2003.\n\nSince 2017, the Steelers have made six playoff appearances, though they've failed to get past the divisional round. Despite recent difficulties, the Steelers remain one of the most successful franchises in NFL history, with six Super Bowl wins from eight appearances.\n\nThe Steelers are the 26th most valuable team in sports in a tie with Ferrari (F1), worth $6.5 billion. In 2015, Forbes reported that the Rooney family had an estimated net worth of $1.2 billion.\n\nArt Rooney II received a D in the NFLPA's ownership ranking. He was given a 6/10 for his \"perceived willingness to invest in the facilities,\" and players feel he \"slightly contributes to a positive team culture\" and is \"committed to building a competitive team.\"\n\nThe Steelers did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIn 1977, Edward DeBartolo Sr. paid $13 million for the San Francisco 49ers to give to his son, Edward DeBartolo Jr.\n\nEdward DeBartolo Jr. ran the 49ers organization throughout the '80s and '90s, leading to five Super Bowl wins and securing his position in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. But in 1998, DeBartolo pleaded guilty \"to not reporting a bribe from a Louisiana government official,\" Forbes reported, so his sister, Denise DeBartolo York, took over ownership in 2001. DeBartolo Jr. was pardoned by Donald Trump in February 2020.\n\nDeBartolo York and her husband, John York, have been cochairs of the team since then, while their son, Jed York, has been CEO since 2010.\n\nIn March 2024, ESPN reported that Jed York was moving to become the team's principal owner. \"I think it's just a move from a family standpoint to just keep this team in our family for generations to come,\" he said, per ESPN.\n\nThough the team hasn't won a Super Bowl since 1994, it has remained competitive. In the last six seasons, the 49ers have made four NFC Championship and two Super Bowl appearances.\n\nThe 49ers are the eighth most valuable franchise in sports, worth $8.6 billion, and the DeBartolo-York family received an A- in ownership from the NFLPA. They have an estimated net worth of $8.4 billion.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks are owned by the Paul G. Allen Estate.\n\nPaul G. Allen was the cofounder of Microsoft alongside Bill Gates. He purchased the Seahawks in 1997 for $194 million.\n\nAt the time of his death in 2018, he had an estimated net worth of $20.3 billion. His estate has since been controlled by his sister, Jody Allen. In July 2024, Sports Illustrated reported she is the team's principal owner and that there's a \"mandate that she eventually sells the team and donates the proceeds to charitable causes\" that Paul Allen supported.\n\nOther members of the Seahawks' senior leadership include president Chuck Arnold and GM John Schneider.\n\nThe Seahawks have been steady since 2018, making multiple playoff appearances and, in the 2025 season, advancing to the Super Bowl, their first NFC Championship and Super Bowl berth since 2014.\n\nThe team is valued at $6.7 billion by Forbes, making it tied with the Boston Celtics for 21st most valuable sports franchise. Jody Allen was given a C+ in ownership.\n\nOwnership of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers is split between the six siblings of the Glazer family: Avram Glazer, Bryan Glazer, Darcie Glazer Kassewitz, Edward Glazer, Joel Glazer, and Kevin Glazer.\n\nThe team was purchased by their father, Malcolm Glazer, in 1995 for $192 million, and they inherited it after his death in 2014. As of 2024, the Glazer family has an estimated net worth of $10.2 billion.\n\nThe NFLPA's team report card gave the family a D+ in ownership, a slight improvement from 2024's D- ranking. Players feel the family \"slightly contributes to a positive team culture\" and \"is somewhat committed to building a competitive team.\" The report also gave the family a 6.5/10 rating for \"perceived willingness to invest in the facilities.\"\n\nThe Buccaneers did not respond to a previous request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe Buccaneers have won two Super Bowls (2003 and 2021) under the Glazer family and are worth $6.6 billion, according to Forbes, making the team the 24th highest valued franchise in the world in a tie with Manchester United, which is also owned by the Glazer family.\n\nAmy Adams Strunk, who has an estimated net worth of $2.8 billion, is the controlling owner and cochair of the Tennessee Titans, having inherited the team in March 2015 after the death of her father, KS \"Bud\" Adams, in 2013. (Adams founded the team as the Houston Oilers in 1960.)\n\nSince 2015, the Titans have had six winning seasons, including five playoff berths.\n\nAs an owner, Adams Strunk has worked to increase the team's staff by more than 150% and has been a key figure in getting approval for a new stadium, the Titans reported. She was awarded a B in ownership by the NFLPA, and the team is ranked as the 30th-most-valuable sports franchise, worth $6.3 billion, per Forbes.\n\nIn 2023, investor Josh Harris purchased the Washington Commanders from Dan Snyder for a record $6.05 billion. He made the purchase through the Harris Ownership Group, which includes limited partners like former NBA star Magic Johnson, investor David Blitzer, and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt.\n\n\"I feel an awesome responsibility to the city of Washington,\" Harris said after the sale, per ESPN. \"I know what I've got to do. It comes down to winning. It's on me and on our ownership group to deliver. That's what we're going to do.\"\n\nHarris has an estimated net worth of $10.7 billion, per Forbes.\n\nHarris was given an A in ownership by the NFLPA after his second season with the team. The Commanders are the 14th most valuable franchise in sports, worth $7.6 billion, per Forbes.\n\nIn the 2024 season, the Commanders made their first NFC Championship since 1992 under the leadership of head coach Dan Quinn and rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels.",

    "description": "Senior figures in sport maintained personal contact with Jeffrey Epstein, while others were discussed regarding potential deals.",
    "fullText": "Senior executives in Formula 1, football and American football maintained their links with Jeffrey Epstein after his conviction for a sex offence, documents included in the latest Epstein files release show.\n\nMillions of new files relating to the notorious American financier were released last Friday.\n\nThey included emails and text messages between Epstein and some public figures who - before the files were released - claimed they had distanced themselves from him following his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor.\n\nThe files also include documents that show discussions about potential business deals involving Epstein, who died in prison in 2019, and high-level sports executives.\n\nBeing named in the documents does not in itself indicate any wrongdoing.\n\nAccording to emails between Epstein and Jean Todt - the former president of motorsport governing body the FIA and team boss of Ferrari during the early 2000s - Todt visited Epstein at the latter's New York home in 2017.\n\nIn May of that year, Epstein emailed Todt to say \"jean, sorry it was so short and Terje did not give me any notice in advance to help with the fun\".\n\n'Terje' appears to be Norwegian diplomat Terje Rod-Larsen, who the files show was also in contact with Epstein, and sent a text message to the American saying: \"Think it could be useful for you to meet Jean Todt. Sent you his contact info. Call him and invite him for coffee.\"\n\nReplying to Epstein, Todt wrote: \"It was nice to get to know you through our common friend Terje. Let me know if you come to Paris or Geneva. I will be back in New York in mid-July.\"\n\nThe following day, Epstein sent an email to Eduardo Teodorani - now chairman and vice-president of the Italian Chamber of Commerce and Industry for the UK - saying: \"i had jean todt to my house ? odd guy.\"\n\nTeodorani replied: \"Very. But why?\" No further replies are visible in the documents.\n\nTodt's name was first mentioned to Epstein in 2013, when another contact - French diplomat Olivier Colom - emailed him to say: \"Going out at Jean Todt tonight. Do you know him? I introduced Terje to him lately. Good man.\"\n\nThe BBC has contacted Todt, who is now the United Nations' special envoy for road safety, for comment.\n\nFlavio Briatore - now executive adviser and de-facto team principal of the Alpine F1 team - also maintained contact with Epstein, according to the files.\n\nOne email from 2010, sent by a person whose identity is redacted, said: \"Flavio Briatore would like to speak with you. He can be reached at his office in London.\"\n\nLater the same year, Epstein referred to Briatore as \"my Italian friend\" in an email chain discussing the potential purchase of an aircraft by Mohamed Al Fayed - the late businessman who has been accused of multiple alleged rapes and attempted rapes.\n\nBriatore was also mentioned in a conversation between Epstein and Lord Mandelson - the former business secretary and US ambassador, who is facing an investigation into alleged misconduct in public office. The subject was a property in Chelsea, which Epstein was told Briatore wanted to sell.\n\nBBC Sport has approached Briatore's representative for comment.\n\nThe files show Crystal Palace investor Josh Harris remained in contact with Epstein via email and phone calls for many years after his conviction, including joining him for a breakfast meeting in 2013 after which he sent an email saying \"thank you for inviting me\".\n\nHarris - whose private equity firm Apollo Global Management also owns NBA team the Philadelphia 76ers, NHL team New Jersey Devils, and the NFL team Washington Commanders - also contacted Epstein in 2016, saying he was \"happy to catch up\" at some point in the future.\n\nA spokesperson for Harris said: \"Josh Harris never had an independent relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. Harris sought to prevent Epstein's attempts to develop a corporate relationship with Apollo. As these emails indicate, Harris sought to avoid meeting with Epstein, cancelling meetings and having others return his calls.\"\n\nEmails sent to Epstein also appear to show he conducted two meetings with Todd Boehly - now co-owner and chairman of Chelsea - in 2011, three years after Epstein's conviction.\n\nThe emails suggest Epstein wanted to be introduced to Boehly, who at the time was co-owner of baseball team the Los Angeles Dodgers, and a managing partner at global asset management firm Guggenheim Partners.\n\nNeither Boehly nor Chelsea have made a public comment.\n\nCeltic owner Dermot Desmond was mentioned twice in emails sent to Epstein in 2010 on behalf of golf resort developer Gerald G Barton.\n\nIn the messages, Epstein was told by somebody writing on behalf of Barton that Irish billionaire Desmond - a golf resort owner - was willing to provide millions of dollars to help co-fund golf developments.\n\nBBC Sport has contacted Celtic for a response from Desmond.\n\nNew York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch repeatedly sent complimentary emails to Epstein in the early 2010s, and Epstein appeared to be attempting to arrange meetings between Tisch and women.\n\nIn one, in 2013, he told Tisch, \"I can bring the Russian if you like\".\n\nIn a statement, Tisch said: \"We had a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition we discussed movies, philanthropy and investments.\n\n\"I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island. As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.\"\n\nThe NFL says it is deliberating whether to conduct a formal investigation into Tisch.\n\n\"We are going to look at all the facts,\" said commissioner Roger Goodell when asked at a news conference about Tisch's conduct.\n\n\"We're going to look at the context of those [messages]. We're going to try to understand that and we'll look at how that falls under the policy,\" Goodell said.\n\nIn 2016, the billionaire property developer Andrew Farkas apologised on behalf of himself and Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross for the condition of the mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, that Epstein visited, and a year later Farkas told Epstein that Ross would be willing to provide up to $100m of funding for a project also part-funded by Epstein.\n\nBBC Sport has approached the Miami Dolphins for comment.\n\nThe files also include contact between sports figures and Ghislaine Maxwell - serving a 20-year federal prison sentence for her role in Epstein's crimes - that took place before her former partner's conviction.\n\nCasey Wasserman - chairman of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games and founder of marketing agency Wasserman - exchanged sexually charged emails with Maxwell in 2003.\n\nWasserman told her \"I miss you\", asked \"can I book that massage now?\" and requested to see Maxwell in \"a tight leather outfit\".\n\nWasserman's agency represents some of the most high-profile athletes in the world.\n\n\"I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light,\" Wasserman said.\n\n\"I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.\"\n\nDavid Wassong, who - according to an online profile - advises entrepreneurs and businesses, sent a message to Maxwell in 2003 asking \"are you going to send me names and numbers of people to play with in Ireland?\"\n\nMaxwell replied with the phone number of former F1 driver Eddie Irvine. She also introduced Irvine to other acquaintances in the same year, according to emails.\n\nIrvine has previously admitted attending parties organised by Epstein and Maxwell in New York and Miami, and says he saw Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's accuser Virginia Giuffre at one event, but presumed she was about 20.\n\n\"I knew Ghislaine reasonably well,\" Irvine said in 2020. \"I spoke to her from time to time and I spoke to [Epstein] from time to time. Ghislaine was always super-sweet and a super-nice lady.\n\n\"When I was around, it was just a normal dinner, just parties. There'd just be a party where some people would turn up and some people wouldn't. But about that other stuff, I have no idea.\"",

    "fullText": "Eyewitness News has learned the murder of former NFL player Kevin Johnson may be connected to three separate murders of homeless people living in encampments along the L.A. River near Willowbrook, sometimes called Compton Creek.\n\nAll four homicides occurred in the same general location in the 1300 block of East 120th Street between October 2025 and January 2026. The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department noted that all four victims were unhoused individuals who were living in encampments in the area.\n\nJohnson's body was found at a homeless encampment next to Compton Creek on Jan. 21. His cause of death was listed as \"blunt head trauma\" and \"stab wounds,\" and the manner of death was ruled a homicide, according to L.A. County Medical Examiner records.\n\nORIGINAL REPORT: Former NFL player Kevin Johnson stabbed to death at LA homeless encampment\n\nFormer NFL player Kevin Johnson was found dead at a homeless encampment in the Los Angeles area. The manner of death was ruled a homicide.\n\nAccording to sources close to the investigation, the string of murders in the Compton Creek area began on Oct. 5, 2025, when a woman, identified as 52-year-old Michelle Steele, was shot in the head. She died in the hospital on Nov. 12, 2025.\n\nThree weeks later, on Dec. 4, a homeless man identified as 52-year-old Octavio Arias was murdered in the same area. According to L.A. County Medical Examiner records, Arias died from head and neck trauma.\n\nThe fourth victim, following the murder of Kevin Johnson, was identified as Mauro Alfaro, also in his 50s. According to sources, Alfaro was killed on Jan. 26, and the cause of death was blunt force trauma.\n\nThe L.A. County Sheriff's Homicide Bureau says investigators are now looking into the possibility that all four murders were done by the same killer. A suspect has not been identified.\n\nDetectives are still trying to determine motives in the killings and trying to figure out if the suspect is someone who is upset with homeless people being in that area, or if drugs or gangs may be involved. Sources say there is no concrete evidence linking the cases together.\n\nEight detectives are working the case, and say they are having a hard time getting information from the homeless population in the area. County workers have been conducting outreach in the area, trying to get the homeless population to move out into other housing.\n\nAnyone with information should call homicide detectives at 323-890-5500 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS(8477).\n\nJohnson, a native of L.A., played for the Philadelphia Eagles and Oakland Raiders from 1995 to 1997.\n\nAfter his career in the NFL ended, he played in the Arena Football League with the Orlando Predators and L.A. Avengers.",

    "description": "One NFL analyst provided a piece of offseason advice for the Jacksonville Jaguars.",
    "fullText": "NFL.com analyst Kevin Patra has a piece of advice for the Jacksonville Jaguars this offseason: re-sign or replace linebacker Devin Lloyd.\n\n\"The Jags seem unlikely to use the franchise tag on Lloyd (projected at $28.2 million, per Over The Cap),\" wrote Patra. \"If he prices himself out of Jacksonville, there will be a gaping hole in the middle of Campanile’s D that needs to be filled.\"\n\nLloyd did a bit of everything for the Jaguars' defense this past season and brought a high-impact presence. When he missed time briefly with an injury during the middle portion of the season, his absence was noticeable.\n\nLloyd finished the season totaling 25 pressures as a blitzer during the regular season, and ranked 11th among linebackers in PFF's run defense grade. In coverage, he recorded five interceptions and two pass breakups.\n\nAs Patra pointed out, the franchise tag won't be an option at that amount. As a free agent, Lloyd is going to garner interest from a number of teams. Spotrac is projecting that he earns a three-year deal worth $60.4 million.\n\nFor a Jaguars team that's a bit short on cap space currently and has other needs to address -- like the defensive line and cornerback -- does Jacksonville have the flexibility to bring Lloyd back at that amount?\n\nIf Lloyd doesn't return, there will certainly be a void to fill in the middle of the Jaguars' defense and no obvious fill-in next to Foye Oluokun.\n\nCurrent on the roster options to potentially take over for Lloyd include Ventrell Miller, Jack Kiser, Yasir Abdullah, and Jalen McLeod.\n\nAddressing this position early on in the draft could be a real possibility for Jacksonville. Anthony Campanile's defensive scheme and his coaching background at the linebacker position may have to be tasked with elevating this unit as well.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jaguars Wire: What Jacksonville Jaguars must accomplish during 2026 NFL offseason",

    "description": "Florida football defensive tackle Caleb Banks lands with the Chargers in ESPN's latest NFL mock draft after a strong Senior Bowl showing.",
    "fullText": "Former Florida football defensive tackle Caleb Banks is projected to be selected by the Los Angeles Chargers with the No. 22 pick, according to ESPN's latest 2026 NFL mock draft.\n\nAccording to analyst Matt Miller, his reasoning is pretty straightforward: the Chargers need more of a true anchor on the defensive line, and Banks fits the mold as a nose tackle who can hold ground against the run while still bringing some juice as a power rusher.\n\nBanks is listed at 6-feet-6-inches and 339 pounds, and Miller describes him as an \"aggressive bull rusher\" with rare first-step quickness for a guy built like that.\n\nBanks' most recent season with the Gators didn't look normal on paper because he was limited to two games due to a foot injury. That's the type of thing that can quietly stall a prospect's momentum, especially when draft cycles move as fast as they do. But that's also where the Senior Bowl comes in.\n\nHis week in Mobile, Alabama, was well-received by scouts, and it sounds like the practices helped reintroduce him as a disruptor instead of \"the injured guy who missed time.\"\n\nBanks still has plenty of runway left in the pre-draft process, and his medicals and testing will matter a ton. But getting slotted in the first round, even in a mock, is the kind of headline that sticks. It puts Banks firmly in the \"name to know\" tier as draft talk heats up.\n\n\"The run on edge rushers before this pick leaves the Chargers with some interesting decisions. Do they add to an offensive line that was marred by injury in 2025 or try to fix a D-line that still needs a true anchor to help defend the run?\n\n\"With the talent that's left on the board, Banks would be very enticing as the nose tackle Los Angeles is missing. The 6-foot-6, 339-pounder is an aggressive bull rusher with rare first-step quickness for his size. Think Vita Vea, but with better length. Banks missed all but two games last season due to a foot injury, but his Senior Bowl performance was well-received by scouts, who saw the explosive play in the trenches that excited them entering the 2025 season.\"\n\nFollow us@GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well asBluesky, and like our page onFacebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nIf you purchase through our links, the USA Today Network may earn a commission.

    "description": "Former LSU cornerback Mansoor Delane is expected to be selected early in the 2026 NFL Draft. Here are three ideal fits for the former Tiger.",
    "fullText": "Former LSU football cornerback Mansoor Delane made his mark during his lone season at LSU, earning first-team All-American honors and finishing as a finalist for the Jim Thorpe Award, which is given to the nation’s top defensive back.\n\nHis impressive 2025 campaign has firmly put him in the conversation for an early first-round pick in the NFL Draft in April. Where he might come off the board is up for debate, with some mock drafts having him go in the early to mid-teens, while one recent mock draft had him taken in the top five.\n\nThe goal of this piece is to take a look at some teams that fit the former Tiger best, but his notoriety limits the options to some extent. It’s highly unlikely Delane makes it past the middle of the first round, so we’re going to limit the available options to teams who are projected to be within range to select him.\n\nThis isn’t only a great fit because Delane would be joining two former Tigers in Cincinnati, though that certainly heightens the intrigue for LSU fans. The Bengals had one of the NFL’s worst passing defenses in 2025, ranking in the bottom quartile of the league in passing EPA/Play, passing success rate allowed, and explosive pass percentage allowed, according to ESPN’s Sam Hoppen.\n\nGiving them a corner with Delane’s talent has proven to be a major factor in turning around defenses in the past, and there are few in the league who need that sort of talent injection more than Cincinnati.\n\nThe Rams were one of the NFL’s best teams this season, and a draft-day trade with the Falcons last offseason landed them what has become the 13th overall pick. Although their defense certainly wasn’t a terrible unit by league standards, their passing defense certainly wasn’t a strength, allowing 7.6 yards per pass attempt this season.\n\nMany mock drafts have the Rams selecting Tennessee cornerback Jermod McCoy over Delane, but Delane feels like the more likely — and smart — pick. This Rams team wants to maximize its Super Bowl window while Matthew Stafford is still playing, and McCoy didn’t play a snap in 2025 due to an injury during the 2024 college football playoff. Despite concerns about Delane’s size and athleticism, he offers the Rams elite coverage play that they don’t have to draft based on year-old tape.\n\nThe Jets are a distinctly different situation from the Rams. This isn’t a team trying to max out a Super Bowl window; it’s a team that’s trying to reload a defensive roster that’s devoid of talent. The draft strategy that works best for a team like this is taking the best player available, and if Delane is still on the board at 16, he certainly qualifies.\n\nAdditionally, Delane would be a great fit for Aaron Glenn’s man-coverage-heavy defense. According to Pro Football Focus, Delane posted the second-best man-coverage grade among Power Four cornerbacks in 2025, meshing perfectly with a Jets defense that ran man coverage fourth-most in the league this season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: Three likely draft destinations for LSU football corner Mansoor Delane",

    "fullText": "Following an electric 2025 season that saw him hoist both the national championship and the Heisman trophy as an Indiana Hoosier, Fernando Mendoza now finds himself as the runaway favorite to be the first overall pick of the 2026 NFL Draft. That means that professional scouts and coaching staff alike will now be assessing not just his athleticism, but his attention to detail, pattern recognition, general recall, and the overall state of his mental capacities.\n\nThere’s a lot that goes into studying and understanding an NFL playbook, but according to one of Mendoza’s former classmates, the Las Vegas Raiders are going to love what they see in Mendoza when they finally get to interview him and quiz him.\n\nA former UC Berkeley student, claiming to have shared a contracts law class with the future first-overall draft pick during his time at the university, suggested that the professor of their class was notorious for giving student athletes, specifically football players, a hard time. “If you are a football player at Cal, there is, unfortunately, a stereotype,” she noted.\n\n“The professor would ask a law question and then ask one of the football players like, ‘Why is this, this?’ or ‘Why is this that?’ Fernando always knew his shit. Like, he would shut up the professor because he would be so impressed that he knew what was going on, and mind you, this is a law class at Berkeley.”\n\nSuffice to say, Mendoza’s competitiveness extends well beyond the football field, and he wasn’t going to be shown up by some uppity law professor from the West Coast. Although the fan did also suggest that the instructor’s confrontations with student athletes were never hostile and predominantly friendly.\n\n“The professor would always tease football players and most of the football players would tease him back, and it would just be some kind of banter.” she recalled. Nevertheless, that kind of attention to detail and willingness to understand the finer points of any subject is exactly what head coaches and coordinators will be looking for in Mendoza’s upcoming interviews.\n\nThrow in the fact that the 22-year-old has one of the most positive attitudes of any prospect in recent memory, and it’s safe to say that this will be a slam dunk for the Raiders on night one of this year’s draft. “Even though he was being teased by the professor, he would just be smiling. He would answer whenever he was asked. He was such a genuine, humble guy.”\n\nMuch has been made of Mendoza’s squeaky clean image, but as more personal testimonies, like this one, begin to come to the forefront, it becomes readily apparent that he is in fact as nice as everyone says he is, and that will certainly go long way in securing him a lengthy career in the National Football League.\n\nThe post “Fernando Mendoza Used to Regularly Stump His Own Law Professor”: Berkeley Law Student Puts Insane Allegations Against Heisman Winner appeared first on The SportsRush.",

He finished his collegiate run with 65 catches for 830 yards and 15 touchdowns. He earned Second-Team All-Big Ten honors and served a key role in Indiana's national championship run.\n\nIt's easy to forget that the Patriots are still a rebuilding team after their magical Super Bowl run this season.

    "description": "The News Tribune asks Seahawks vice chair Bert Kolde after NFL commissioner’s press conference about reports the team will be sold soon.",
    "fullText": "The sale of the Seahawks — the issue the team would rather not have the week of their first Super Bowl appearance in more than decade — isn’t going away.\n\n“We put out our statement. So I can’t say anything beyond that,” Seahawks vice chair Bert Kolde said Monday, after he and his wife sat in the front row representing the NFC champions at commissioner Roger Goodell’s annual state-of-the-NFL press conference at the Super Bowl.\n\nThe statement Kolde referred to Monday at the San Jose Convention Center was the Paul G. Allen Estate’s assertion Friday “the team is not for sale” — with “is” doing a ton of lifting there. The estate’s statement also reiterated the estate that owns the Seahawks dictates the team must be sold. Most of the proceeds will go to Allen’s many philanthropic interests before his death in 2018. The Paul G. Allen Estate issued that statement through a spokesman Friday. That was soon after ESPN and The Wall Street Journal reported the Seahawks would be sold soon after this season ended with Seattle’s Super Bowl.\n\nMoments before Kolde spoke Monday, Goodell said in his press conference a report this past weekend by The Wall Street Journal that the league fined the Seahawks $5 million for continuing to violate NFL rules by having an estate and not an individual person or group of people own a club is not true.\n\nThis much we know: The Seahawks’ sale is going to happen. It’s not a matter of if, not when.\n\nAnd signs are pointing to the when being in the months following the Super Bowl.\n\nKolde said he, chair Jody Allen, other leaders from Vulcan, LLC, the company Paul Allen formed to manage the Seahawks have studied the recent sales of North American sports franchises. That includes the NBA’s Boston Celtics (for $6 billion), the Los Angeles Lakers (a record $10 billion) and the most recent sale of an NFL team. That was the Washington Commanders, for $6.05 billion in 2023.\n\n“We study all teams, all the sales. That’s something we keep abreast of,” the Seahawks’ vice chair said.\n\nThe Allen Estate put the Portland Trail Blazers up on sale in September. Kolde said Monday he expects that sale to be final this spring. It’s about to go to a group led by the owner of the National Hockey League’s Carolina Hurricanes for a reported $4.25 billion.\n\n“Still tracking to close in a couple months,” Kolde said.\n\nWith the Blazers sale closing, it makes sense (and billions of dollars) that the Seahawks are next.\n\nThe Seahawks are most likely going to set an NFL record for a franchise sale, perhaps in excess of $8 billion.\n\nThe News Tribune asked Kolde off the stage following Goodell’s 45-minute press conference Monday if the Seahawks already have local buyers on the horizon to sell to.\n\n“Nothing to add,” Kolde said to that.\n\nIs there is anything in the estate’s instructions for the sale of the Seahawks that assures the franchise remains in Seattle? A stipulation it must be sold to local owners? A contract from whoever buys the team that binds them to keep the Seahawks in the city?\n\nTo that, Kolde referenced the team’s 30-year lease with Lumen Field runs through 2031. He did not comment on the 20-year option the team has with the stadium and the local government district that runs it beyond 2031.\n\n“l’m not going to get into all of that, all of that detail,” Kolde said.\n\n“But the Allen family put a lot into saving the Seahawks, keeping them in Seattle (by Paul Allen buying the team in 1997 from Ken Behring, who tried to move the team to Southern California). We campaigned around the state (for the new stadium that opened in 2002 and replaced the Kingdome). The voters agreed with us. And we put together Lumen Field.\n\n“And we delivered on everything we promised in that campaign. The team. The stadium. Soccer balls were on our posters. The Sounders launched as the most successful MLS team. The World Cup is coming; we talked about World Cup back in that campaign.\n\n“So we’ve been all about sports in the community for decades. So the lease has six years or so...”\n\nLeague owners want the Seahawks to sell sooner than later, so they can learn the latest relative valuations of their teams in this post-COVID world with the league’s new media rights deals that provides $11 billion in annual revenue to the NFL. The league signed that a couple years ago.\n\nAsked if the NFL was pressuring the team to sell soon, Kolde said: “No comment on that.”\n\nKolde said Jody Allen will be at Super Bowl 60 Sunday against the New England Patriots at Levi’s Stadium in nearby Santa Clara.",

    "fullText": "Jets' rounds 1-2 prediction from ESPN would be near-perfect draft class originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Jets have a lot of work to do this offseason. Aside from filling out their new-look coaching staff, the Jets also need to nail their free agent spending and their draft picks this offseason.\n\nThey're not going to get the top quarterback in Fernando Mendoza, but with a huge hole at the position, a QB down the board isn't out of the question. But, they're much more than a QB away from competing for a playoff spot.\n\nThat's why ESPN's Matt Miller's mock draft for Rounds 1 and 2 would be a near-perfect scenario for the Jets. Not only do they land incredible talent at positions of need, but they don't overspend on any player in the class.\n\nAt the second overall pick, Miller has the Jets taking Ohio State edge rusher Arvell Reese. With a huge hole at QB, Miller elects to go with a pass rusher for the Jets.\n\nWhy? \"After ranking 31st in sacks this season (26),\" Miller writes, \"New York needs a primary pass rusher who will scare offenses.\"\n\nReese will do just that, as he's one of the best defensive players in the class, and while he split time at linebacker, the development of Micah Parsons and Abdul Carter in the NFL is the reason not worry about this selection.\n\nThen, down the board at pick 16, Miller has the Jets going offense. Except, it's not a quarterback. He has the Jets taking USC wide receiver Makai Lemon.\n\nWhile Garrett Wilson is a great number one WR, the Jets need more weapons for a quarterback, and Lemon, at 5-foot-11, 195 pounds, with some incredible toughness and playmaking ability, would be a great addition to the WR room.\n\nThe Jets then pick 33rd overall, and Miller still isn't going QB. Instead, he has the Jets taking a Quinnen Williams replacement in Ohio State DT Kayden McDonald.\n\n\"McDonald projects as a starter-level nose tackle or 1-technique with the power to keep the linebackers behind him clean and run lanes stuffed,\" Miller writes.\n\nMcDonald is a nice addition for the Jets, and combined with Reese, the Jets would be adding two Ohio State defenders inside the top 33 picks, both of which would be huge upgrades for the defense, which struggled big-time in 2025.\n\nMore: Jets predicted to draft 'high-ceiling' QB prospect in first round by Mel Kiper Jr.\n\nAnd then, with the Jets 44rd pick in the second round, Miller finally goes quarterback with Alabama's Ty Simpson.\n\n\"Simpson doesn't have a Round 1 grade on my board, and I couldn't find a single team that would give him one during conversations at the Senior Bowl,\" Miller writes.\n\nInstead of the Jets panicking and getting overly aggressive, taking Simpson (or another QB) in the first round, they take Simpson in the middle of the second round in this mock draft from Miller.\n\nWhile Simpson might not be fully ready to be an NFL starter, this draft pick is much more excusable to take a low-floor, high-ceiling QB prospect at.\n\nOverall, Miller has the Jets taking with picks 2, 16, 33, and 44: ED Arvell Reese, WR Makai Lemon, DT Kayden McDonald, and QB Ty Simpson.\n\nComing out of the draft with a top pass rusher, a top wide receiver, a great interior defensive lineman, and a flier at the QB position would be a nearly perfect way to go about the first two rounds for the Jets.\n\nJets linked to $180 million QB to replace Justin Fields after failed $40M experiment\n\nJets expected to replace Justin Fields with two quarterbacks in NFL Draft, free agency\n\nJets get bad news on possible trade-up with Raiders for first overall pick\n\nNFL insider takes subtle jab at Jets with Titans hiring Robert Saleh as head coach\n\nDante Moore staying at Oregon rumor is terrible look for New York Jets\n\nJets named top landing spot for 1,100-yard rusher if Breece Hall departs in free agency",

Now, teams can decline if they have a first-year head coach, are part of the division featured on the in-season version of \"Hard Knocks,\" or have been featured on the training camp version within the last eight seasons.\n\nIt's still possible that the AFC West could be chosen as the division for the in-season version of \"Hard Knocks\" in 2026. If that happens, Denver would not be selected for the summer show. If the AFC West is not selected, the Broncos will be eligible to be featured during training camp.\n\nWith a hat tip to @NerdingonNFL, here's a look at the 16 teams that could be featured on \"Hard Knocks\" this summer.\n\nLast year, the NFL announced the in-season division (the NFC East) and the training camp team (the Buffalo Bills) in May. The league will likely follow a similar timeline in 2026.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL news: Broncos among 16 teams eligible for Hard Knocks this summer",

    "fullText": "The New York Giants face a critical wide receiver need heading into the offseason, as highlighted in Pro Football Focus' analysis of teams' biggest priorities for free agency and the 2026 NFL draft.\n\nPFF believes the Giants should focus on adding a receiver at No. 5 overall. Specifically, Ohio State wideout Carnell Tate.\n\nBiggest Need: Wide receiver Target: WR Carnell Tate, Ohio State\n\nMalik Nabers flashed star potential as a rookie in 2024, ranking eighth out of 133 qualifying wide receivers in PFF overall grade (86.7). He appeared in just four games this season before suffering a torn ACL, so we didn’t get an opportunity to see how he would develop with quarterback Jaxson Dart.\n\nBeyond Nabers, the Giants' wide receiver unit looks thin, especially since slot specialist Wan'Dale Robinson is heading into free agency and may not be back with the team. Sometimes overshadowed by Jeremiah Smith at Ohio State, Tate is a polished prospect in his own right after finishing fifth in the FBS with an 89.0 PFF receiving grade. He also did not drop a single pass across 66 targets this season.\n\nNabers' injury-shortened 2025 campaign underscores the urgency for depth and a reliable complement.\n\nTate, a 6-foot-3 OSU standout, offers elite reliability -- boasting a near-perfect drop rate and strong efficiency even while sharing targets with top talents. His high PFF grades and production (875 yards and nine touchdowns in 2025 despite missing time) position him as a potential top-10 pick, frequently mocked to the Giants at No. 5.\n\nTargeting Tate makes strategic sense to bolster Jaxson Dart's options and build around Nabers long-term. While the draft class is deep, passing on a polished, high-upside receiver like Tate could prolong the Giants' offensive struggles.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: 2026 NFL draft: Should New York Giants target WR Carnell Tate?",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJordon Hudson took Bill Belichick’s Pro Football Hall of Fame snub personal by planning a celebration of her own.\n\nAccording to a report from People, Belichick's girlfriend is organizing a “huge bash” for the legendary coach on Aug. 8 — the same day the Pro Football Hall of Fame will induct its Class of 2026 in Canton, Ohio.\n\nThe party is expected to take place just weeks before Belichick begins his second season as the head coach at North Carolina. The event is reportedly intended as a show of support after Belichick fell one vote short of first-ballot induction, receiving 39 of the 40 votes required for election.\n\nHudson is expected to invite several prominent figures closely tied to Belichick’s career, including Tom Brady, Jimmy Johnson and Bill Parcells. Many of whom would have otherwise attended the ceremony in Canton. An anonymous source told People the purpose of the bash is “to celebrate alongside all of his people.”\n\nBelichick’s omission sparked widespread reaction across the NFL world, with reports suggesting internal politics among voters may have played a role.\n\nIn response to the backlash, the Hall of Fame released a statement affirming the integrity of its selection process and noting that any violations of voting bylaws could result in disciplinary action.\n\nBelichick, who owns eight Super Bowl rings — six as a head coach — and a 302-165 career record, has not publicly addressed the snub. His focus remains on his next chapter in college football, but Hudson ensures his legacy is celebrated anyway.\n\nSNL pokes fun at Michael Irvin's amped up Miami Hurricanes fandom\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nJimmy Kimmel roasts Bill Belichick’s girlfriend over Hall of Fame debate\n\nGoogle changes Curt Cignetti search results following Indiana’s CFP title win\n\nEx-Indiana QB fires back after portrayal in CBS 60 Minutes interview",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals, Dallas Cowboys, Seattle Seahawks, and San Francisco 49ers could target a former Pro Bowl edge rusher this offseason to upgrade their defenses.\n\nCBS Sports' Zach Pereles believes Jadeveon Clowney could have a decent market in free agency, with the Bengals, Cowboys, Seahawks, and 49ers as potential suitors.\n\nPereles adds his prediction of Clowney leaving Dallas to sign with Cincinnati:\n\n\"Even at 32, Clowney showed he can get after the passer and stop the run at a high level. The Bengals very much need both.\"\n\nClowney played in 13 games and started six for the Cowboys in 2025, posting 8.5 sacks and 40 quarterback pressures, proving that he can still be a valuable part of a pass-rushing rotation.\n\nDallas should look to retain Clowney, but if he does leave, any contender will be interested in the former No. 1 pick.\n\nCincinnati and San Francisco could use more pass-rushing help, especially the Bengals if they lose Trey Hendrickson. Clowney would step in as an immediate starter for the Bengals and provide solid production as a complementary pass rusher.\n\nThe 49ers could also use Clowney to pair with Nick Bosa, who will return in 2026 after playing just three games in 2025 due to a torn ACL. An edge rusher duo of Bosa and Clowney would be electric and revive a San Francisco pass rush that ranked last in the NFL in sacks this year.\n\nThough they already have a stacked defense, don't rule out a reunion between Clowney and the Seahawks.

    "fullText": "How is the tight end situation with the Cleveland Browns? Will quality backups be needed? Will the team look to NFL free agency, the NFL draft, or both to help the room?\n\nTight end Justin Joly of North Carolina State got an invite from the Senior Bowl and was thrilled that he was considered one of the best at his position. He also wanted to prove that he belonged and would make a great addition to any roster.\n\nJoly grew up in New Rochelle, New York, and went to UConn for two years, where he led the team in receptions. He entered the final week of the regular season ranked third in FBS in both categories for tight ends.\n\nAfter going 3-9-0 in 2023, he then entered the portal and took the offer from North Carolina State.\n\nMore than blessed to be on this earth for 18 years\n\n— Justin Joly (@jjoly_17) July 9, 2022\n\nNC State finished its 2024 season with a 9-4-0 record and one game out of first place in the conference with a 6-2-0 mark. But they couldn’t beat Notre Dame and Duke in critical conference play. However, they did thump their rival, North Carolina, 39-20.\n\nJolly was named First Team All-ACC after his senior season.\n\nDawgs by Nature staff writer Barry Shuck was at the Senior Bowl this week. He interviewed Joly during a practice session.\n\n————————————————————————————————————————————\n\nShuck: You were the leading receiver at UConn, yet you left. What was the issue?\n\nJoly: Coming out of high school, I didn’t have many offers. UConn was the best choice. After leading my team in catches, I wanted bigger opportunities and didn’t see them with UConn playing schools like Ball State, Fresno State, and Sacred Heart. I wanted bigger games with a Power-5 school. Then we only won three games, so I talked to my family and decided that, as much as I enjoyed my time at UConn and loved the coaching staff, I entered the portal. I improved my blocking and route running while at UConn. NC State, Tennessee, and Houston offered.\n\nShuck: You grew up in New York State, so UConn was close to home. Did that enter into your decision to end up in the State of North Carolina, where the weather and culture are so much different?\n\nJoly: Honestly, it really didn’t matter to me. I just want to play good football. I know I’m far away from home, and my mom didn’t like that much. It’s a great place where I’m at. The culture and fanbase at NC State are great, and my coaches have a lot of respect for me and are really hyped for the season.\n\nShuck: How do you describe your game?\n\nJoly: I am resilient and will fight with my brothers. I am the person who is giving 100%, 100% of the time. Just watch what you did and correct, and do whatever you got to do.\n\nShuck: What do you need to improve?\n\nJoly: A little bit of everything. There’s nothing to my game, I think is perfect, nor will ever be. I would say route running, hands, and work more on blocking.  I’m a true competitor and look for every edge I can get.\n\nJoly: My ability after the catch with good hands, blocking downfield. I am a great downfield blocker. I am good at reading and understanding defenses. And if the offense needs to play fast, I’m there for it.\n\nShuck: What do you learn most after a loss?\n\nJoly: They beat us, and we beat ourselves. So, really, it was 22 versus zero. It’s hard because I hate losing. Always props to the other team, but find the issues and make corrections. Then work at it, bring the pressure, and prep for it. You have to keep your head up and maintain the good energy that we have within the facility.\n\nShuck: NFL teams like physical tools, and you are a former basketball player. What skills in that sport have helped you in football?\n\nJoly: Playing a position that requires catching passes means being able to jump, and a lot of passes aren’t near where I need the ball to be, so you have to adjust and go after it. I study a lot of film and want to be on the same page as my quarterback, but sometimes the pass rush changes the pattern of the ball in flight. I am a good jumper, and with my height, I feel I can get up more than any linebacker covering me. Plus, all the running in basketball.\n\nShuck: You haven’t gotten the attention and respect nationally for being such a good tight end. Do you walk around with a chip on your shoulder?\n\nJoly: Honestly, that doesn’t faze me because at the end of the day, I think my teammates know what I am capable of. And a lot of times, your job is just to block for other players to get the stats and attention. And that’s my job in that game. In the next game, I might get the most targets. I want the respect of the people in the locker room.",

    "description": "The NFL has informed its clubs about the salary cap outlook for 2026.",
    "fullText": "While the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks are preparing for their showdown in Super Bowl LX, the other 30 teams in the NFL are already in offseason mode. On Friday, the NFL shared some crucial information with all of them: the salary cap projection for the upcoming season is out.\n\nAccording to a report by NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero, the league will set its spending ceiling for 2026 in the range of $301.2 million to $305.7 million per team. For comparison, the cap was set at $279.2 million for the current season.\n\nAt between 7.9% and 9.5%, the increase from 2025 to 2026 marks the latest major jump in the cap. In the five years since taking a one-year dip due to the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic, it has grown by more than $100 million.\n\nDespite having been among the most active team in the NFL last offseason, the Patriots are again in decent shape heading into 2026.\n\nAccording to salary cap expert Miguel Benzan, who is using the middle ground of $303.45 million for his calculations, the AFC champions are currently projected to be $42.6 million under the cap with 50 players signed. This places them in the top-10 for the next league year.\n\nNew England may be less financially flexible as last spring, when the club was near the top of the table, but it still has ample resources available to maintain the quality of its roster and add outside talent. At the moment, after all, only seven of its current players are headed for unrestricted free agency, with defensive linemen Khyiris Tonga and K’Lavon Chaisson as well as safety Jaylinn Hawkins the most prominent names on the list.",

    "description": "Kansas City Chiefs fans need to check out some of the best defensive linemen from the Senior Bowl before the 2026 NFL Draft.",
    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs need to add depth, and maybe even a starter, along their defensive line in the 2026 NFL Draft. Fortunately, some of the best trench players in the class recently came together to compete in Mobile, Ala. for the Senior Bowl. Several prospects stood out as potential targets for the Chiefs.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Focus, George Karlaftis was the only Kansas City edge rusher to amass 35 or more pressures in 2025. For reference, 59 edge rushers across the entire NFL reached that threshold. Within the AFC West, a duo of Denver Broncos, three Las Vegas Raiders and three Los Angeles Chargers accomplished the feat. Only the Chiefs lagged behind.\n\nFuture Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive tackle Chris Jones helps the Chiefs keep their noses above water in the pass rush, but he offers limited value in run defense at this stage of his career. Jones turns 32 years old before the start of the 2026 season.\n\nThe Chiefs need to add immediate production on the edge while also considering the long-term future of their interior defensive line. The Senior Bowl features enough star prospects to satisfy both needs, if the Chiefs hit on their selections.\n\nWhen the 2026 Panini Senior Bowl kicks off at 1:30 p.m. CT today on NFL Network, Chiefs fans should keep an eye out for these five star defensive linemen.\n\nHeight is undersized at 6’2 3/8”, 234 lbs. with 32 3/4” arms. Those measurements didn’t stop him from dominating opposing offensive tackles during the team periods. He beat Dametrious Crownover with an outside jab into a B-gap swim and reached the quarterback in just 2.1 seconds on Wednesday. Height’s speed rush is very effective and sets up his twitchy inside counters.\n\nHeight suffered several clean losses. He struggles to win when offensive tackles get into his pads early in the play, and his limited mass makes it difficult to survive heavy punches. Height projects best as a rotational edge rusher who could develop into a full-time starter, similar to Alex Highsmith’s path on the Steelers.\n\nJacas, Kyle Louis and Zion Young stood at the pinnacle of performance throughout the Senior Bowl practices. At 6’3 1/8”, 260 lbs. with 32 3/4” arms, Jacas is a stout, sawed-off rusher capable of driving through the offensive tackle’s frame with power, winning around the corner with technical savvy or reducing inside to challenge guards.\n\nJacas won at the Senior Bowl with an outside speed rush, speed-to-power conversion, chop-rip combinations and swims through the B-gap. His explosiveness off the line of scrimmage led to several instantaneous wins.\n\nJacas fits the archetype of edge rusher Kansas City values. He entered the week with mixed grades. Now, it seems inconceivable that he goes anywhere later than the early third round.\n\nBanks missed most of his final season with injuries and started off on the wrong foot in Mobile. His first day or practice was a wash, but he dominated across the final two sessions. At 6’6”, 335 lbs. with 35” arms and 10 3/4” hands, Banks is a behemoth capable of pushing the pocket or applying clean pressure by discarding guards with his violent hands.\n\nCaleb Banks gets a win on Auburn’s Jeremiah Wright, and he’s feeling pretty good about it. #thedraftstartsinmobile #seniorbowl #nfldraft pic.twitter.com/qIbxVFIQXi\n\n— Sam Teets (@Sam_Teets33) January 29, 2026\n\nBanks displays rare foot quickness and agility early in plays, especially for a defender his size. His pad level becomes a limiting factor late in games, but the tradeoff seems worth it for teams hoping to add more muscle to their defensive front.\n\nHunter is a physical freak in his own right. He’s 6’3 1/2”, 320 lbs. with 34 1/4” arms. His rare explosiveness helps him drive vertically on pass plays, but he also possesses the quickness and lateral agility to exchange gaps or sidestep and play around blockers.\n\nLee Hunter is a top 50 player for me. 330-lb NT with heavy hands and a very quick first step for his size. Comfortably the most detailed and instinctive pass rusher in the '26 NT class pic.twitter.com/NC3o1WNdu9\n\n— James Foster (@NoFlagsFilm) December 10, 2025\n\nHunter’s stout anchor and long arms make it easy for him to stack, peek and shed blockers in the run game. Displacing him at the point of attack is a challenging task. Hunter resets the line of scrimmage by driving blockers into the backfield and finishes big plays with his closing burst.\n\nHunter’s skill set and playstyle make him the perfect complement to Chris Jones. The Texas Tech product should rank near the top of Kansas City’s draft board.\n\nYoung ranked among the top performers at the Senior Bowl. He is a dense and powerful edge rusher at 6’5 1/4”, 262 lbs. with 33 1/2” arms. Throughout the week, he displayed the power to push the pocket and soften angles before finishing his rushes with counters.\n\nThe power that Missouri’s Zion Young has shown at the Senior Bowl is terrifying. You don’t want to see him lining up across from you in a four-point stance with those bent elbows. pic.twitter.com/qCksPcbCZh\n\n— Bobby Football (@Rob__Paul) January 29, 2026\n\nYoung sent Jude Bowry tumbling in a one-on-one rep and folded J.C. Davis in one of the most dominant displays of power all week. Young primarily relies on winning through the offensive lineman’s frame or countering into or prying open the B-gap because of his lack of bend. However, his long strides help him push upfield quickly and led to some clean wins in the team periods.\n\nYoung’s arm length, play strength and anchor also make him an effective edge-setter in the run game.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs NFL Draft: Watch these 5 Senior Bowl defensive linemen",

    "description": "Mike Evans hasn’t had the first discussion with the Bucs about his future. There have been no conversations about 2026 with his agent, Deryk Gilmore, who is currently focused on clients in the NFL draft.",
    "fullText": "Mike Evans hasn’t had the first discussion with the Bucs about his future. There have been no conversations about 2026 with his agent, Deryk Gilmore, who is currently focused on clients in the NFL draft.\n\nStill, as with any pending free agent, there is going to be speculation.\n\nEvans will be 33 by the time training camp gets underway in August. He can retire, return to play for the Bucs or take his talents elsewhere.\n\nEvans is the greatest offensive player in franchise history, a certain future Pro Football Hall of Famer who tied Jerry Rice with an NFL-record 11 consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons to begin his career.\n\nHe endured six full years in Tampa Bay without so much as a whiff of the playoffs, then the Bucs won Super Bowl 55 in his first postseason.\n\nBut this season, Evans was limited to eight games by a hamstring injury and a broken clavicle. The streak died. He caught only 30 passes.\n\nEven so, Evans proved he still had plenty of football left in the tank when he returned after eight weeks to catch six passes for a season-high 132 yards, including a 45-yard reception, in a late-season loss to Atlanta.\n\nHe showed speed, quickness and agility, and brought energy to the offense.\n\nThe first question for any player when contemplating their future is whether they still can impact the game. For Evans, it’s a resounding yes.\n\nQuarterback Baker Mayfield hasn’t talked to Evans this offseason but predicted this past week he would continue playing and that it would be for the Bucs.\n\n“Mike’s too much of a competitor and cares too much about Tampa to end his career without 1,000 yards, without a division championship, without a playoff run,” Mayfield said on “The Ronde Barber Show.”\n\nNew Bucs offensive coordinator Zac Robinson said Tuesday he had not spoken to Evans but wants him back. The fact Mayfield is confident in Robinson, who was the Rams’ passing game coordinator and quarterbacks coach when he spent five weeks with LA in 2022, is a plus.\n\n“I have a ton of respect for Mike and his game throughout his career,” Robinson said. “Obviously, watching from afar, I know he’s got to work through a lot of things, but I would obviously love an opportunity to work with Mike.”\n\nTony Pauline of “Essentially Sports” said this week that those he’d spoken to believe there’s a less than 50-50 chance Evans would want to return to the Bucs in 2026. He suggested Evans would prefer to go to a team that has a better chance of winning a Super Bowl.\n\nBut it may be best to hear it from Evans’ own mouth.\n\nHe covered many of the same subjects in an interview with the Tampa Bay Times prior to a preseason game in Pittsburgh in August. At the time, Evans knew he was nearing the end of his career.\n\n“This game is going to be gone, and I ain’t going to be able to do this anymore,” he said. “I know I’m not playing more than five years. Hell, maybe not more than three, we’ll see.”\n\nEvans admitted that as he has gotten older, it’s become harder to practice.\n\n“The games are the fun part. The games are easy. It’s training all year. I know it’s routine, but it takes a toll as you get older,” he said.\n\n“I stay in shape. I learned that a long time ago, and I wished I’d learned it sooner. Like, my first two years, I was big. ... When you see the pictures, I have a fat face and love handles that are a little bigger. Now I give my trainer a week or two after the season. We start light, and we just build up gradually.”\n\nFamily is Evans’ biggest priority. Two years ago, his wife, Ashli, convinced him to re-sign with the Bucs for two years and $41 million. The couple have three children together: daughters Ariah Lynn and Aliyah Nicole, and son Amari Thomas, along with a stepdaughter named Mackenzie.\n\n“It motivates me to play longer,” Evans said. “They keep me younger.”\n\nThere also is a big financial component for both the Bucs and Evans to consider.\n\nThe player who most resembles Evans in terms of production and age is Davante Adams, who signed a two-year, $44 million deal with the Rams last March. But Chris Godwin will enter the second year of a three-year, $66 million deal, and the Bucs are suddenly loaded at receiver with Evans, Godwin, Emeka Egbuka, Jalen McMillan and Tez Johnson. Of course, 2025 tested that depth.\n\nWhile money won’t be what determines Evans’ future, it would be naïve to think it isn’t a factor.\n\n“The money’s great, and I just love the game. I love to compete,“ he said. ”And while I’m blessed to still have this ability, I’m going to try to maximize it.\n\n“I’ve got a lot of friends and family. There’s so much behind the scenes that nobody will ever know about. But that’s the other thing that motivates me. And I’m seeing the contracts and I’m like, ‘Wow, that’s crazy.’ I mean, I don’t make what Ja’Marr Chase is getting, $40 million a year? And I’m half of that. It’s still great money. It’s money you dream of making.”\n\nThe last time Evans was a free agent, he had offers from the Chiefs and Texans. Patrick Mahomes is coming off an ACL injury but is expected back by the start of the 2026 regular season. Houston is only 50 miles from Evans’ hometown of Galveston, and the Texans have a Super Bowl-caliber defense.\n\nIf Evans is merely chasing a ring, it might make more sense for him to sign with a team like Buffalo with quarterback Josh Allen or the Patriots with Drake Maye.\n\nRetirement doesn’t seem like it will be Evans’ first choice. His kids are homeschooled, and the family splits time between Tampa and Texas.\n\nHe knows he has a few more good years left, and once you put the keys on the table it’s hard to pick them back up again.\n\n“That’s what every athlete wants to do,” Evans said in August. “Like LeBron (James) or Tom (Brady). They wish they could do that. That’s what I’m trying to maximize. I’m not going to play 20 years, but I’m going to try to play as long as I can while I’m at the top of my game.”\n\nAt the time, Evans sounded like he wanted to keep playing. Mayfield makes some good points: He won’t want to go out playing in only eight games, catching only 30 passes and missing the playoffs.\n\nBut he needs some time and space to make a decision.\n\nEvery weekday, tune into our Sports Day Tampa Bay podcast to hear reporter Rick Stroud break down the biggest stories in Tampa Bay sports.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

    "description": "Twanna Harris explains the emotional and financial challenges of parenting NFL athletes and why she founded League of Industry Moms.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Twanna Harris, the founder of League of Industry Moms. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm a mom to two athletes. Between my husband and me, we have four kids, two sons and two daughters. William, my oldest, has played for the Washington Commanders for seven years. My son Trey is what we call our \"next kid up.\" He is at Sam Houston State University, and he's started training for the NFL draft.\n\nMy husband played in the NFL, so I believe our family is uniquely equipped to navigate this process and provide structure and discipline.\n\nHowever, there were things that surprised me, even though I was not expecting them.\n\nInjuries are actually the last thing I'm worried about.\n\nI am the one who has guided my sons to where they are today. I researched programs, coordinated the move to other schools when necessary, identified trainers, researched colleges that provide the best opportunity, and provided the necessary financial, emotional, and mental support to properly navigate the transition from high school to college, in preparation for making it to the pros.\n\nWhen going through that transition, I felt like the sentiment was, \"Thanks so much for your contribution, but we'll take it from here.\" There weren't conversations with us parents about how to navigate and sustain salaries once they went pros, for example.\n\nAdditionally, I didn't get any coaching or direction on how to choose the best advisor or counsel for your athlete's specific situation.\n\nI helped one of my sons go through a rough patch, which had isolating moments, and I knew I couldn't be the only mother trying to figure this out by myself. This drove my desire for community, and after speaking with numerous mothers of athletes, I quickly realized that what I experienced was more of the norm than the exception.\n\nBecause there's no blueprint or guidebook, I launched my collective, League of Industry Moms, to crowdsource support and resources to help us navigate this terrain together.\n\nWe look into everything from media training to financial literacy, such as how kids should set up their finances for when they are 50, and helping them understand the significance of their spending for the next five years.\n\nTypically, a kid is not celebrated daily for their job. But because my kids are athletes, they are — and are receiving death threats at the same time. Nothing feels real anymore, and it feels like everyone's coming to get a piece of your child. One day, we're in this together as a family, and the next, your kid is saying, \"Hey Mom, I'm an adult now, I don't need your permission to take a $425,000 check.\"\n\nBecause they are legally adults, there's no requirement for brands to speak with parents. There can be a false sense of reality here because, early on, players receive a substantial amount of resources, attention, and money. There's no player association or union, so I've partnered with an organization called athletes.org to make sure we are educating parents going through this.\n\nMy husband and I have raised our kids to be extraordinarily independent. The whole point is to raise kids to be self-sufficient, but this is a different kind of survival. Someone whose frontal lobe has yet to develop is being handed a check for millions, and they are expected to have the wherewithal to know what to do with that.\n\nThe most important thing my husband and I wanted to teach our athletes is the art of listening and the discernment gained through that process to detect when someone might be motivated by the wrong intentions or when something they are saying simply doesn't sound right.",

Well he compares his thought process to Anya Taylor-Joy's character in the Netflix hit The Queen's Gambit. She is cast as a talented female chess player, who could envision future moves on the board in real time.\n\n\"When I'm watching football, the best way that I describe it [is like] The Queen's Gambit,\" Manyweather tells BBC Sport. \"My wife said that how all the moves would go on the ceiling at night, how the player would see it [in the TV show], that's kind of how I see it.\"",

    "fullText": "According to ESPN’s lead NFL insider, Adam Schefter, Denver Broncos pass game coordinator/quarterbacks coach Davis Webb is withdrawing from consideration for the Las Vegas Raiders head coaching job.\n\nWebb has had several offensive coordinator requests recently and is a prime candidate to become the Denver Broncos offensive coordinator, according to NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport.\n\nBroncos passing game coordinator Davis Webb is withdrawing from consideration from the Raiders head coaching job, per source. Webb interviewed for head coaching jobs with the Raiders, Bills and Ravens. pic.twitter.com/4FYpPGQ0MX\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 30, 2026\n\nDavis Webb was considered a favorite for the Las Vegas Raiders head coaching job, but all signs point to them favoring Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak instead. Both the Cardinals and the Raiders are waiting until this weekend to meet with him in hopes of hiring him after the Super Bowl. With the writing on the wall and likely not wanting to be the backup option, Webb withdrew his name from consideration.\n\nWith Webb officially out of the Raiders’ head coaching search, he becomes one of the hottest offensive coordinator names currently on the market. Several teams, including the Baltimore Ravens, New York Giants, and Philadelphia Eagles (before they hired their OC earlier today) have already put in requests to interview Webb for their offensive coordinator positions. Also, his current team, the Denver Broncos, fired offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi and would like to promote Webb to offensive coordinator if possible.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Webb will interview with the Ravens, Giants, or any other teams for their offensive coordinator jobs. He has impressed in interviews, is viewed as an up-and-coming coach, and is well-liked and regarded around the league so it would make sense for teams to be interested. However, with the Broncos firing Lombardi and opening up their offensive coordinator position, you have to assume there is mutual interest between the two sides and that the Broncos are the favorites to land him as their offensive coordinator.\n\nWebb would benefit from another year under Sean Payton and would get more valuable experience as his offensive coordinator. While he may not call plays, he would be in the booth, communicating with Payton throughout the game, and would be a key part of game-planning each week.\n\nThere is no guarantee that Webb will return to the Broncos, as other teams can and likely will offer him play-calling opportunities, but I believe they will make a strong push for him. This should unfold in the coming days, and hopefully, Webb returns to the Broncos, this time, as their offensive coordinator.",

    "description": "The Dallas Cowboys are looking for defensive players they can pick up in the 2026 NFL draft and these Senior Bowl standouts ae great options",
    "fullText": "While the top two teams in the NFL prepare for the Super Bowl, the Dallas Cowboys and 29 other squads are firmly fixated on talent acquisition. From coaching staff to free agency to the 2026 NFL draft, the Cowboys are treasure hunting.\n\nMidway through Senior Bowl week, some draft hopefuls are standing out amongst their peers. The hope for Cowboys fans is that some of these standouts are at positions of need for Dallas. The Cowboys need to add players at linebacker, defensive end, safety, offensive tackle and cornerback, just to name a few. As luck would have it, some of those players are indeed flashing in practice.\n\nEarly standout reports have highlighted the defensive ends who have been jumping off the screen. The one’s mentioned here at Cowboys Wire have continued their strong play and should firmly be on Dallas’ radar this April. Today we look at three more.\n\nBud Clark has been turning heads here at the midpoint. The 6-foot-1, 185-pound safety from TCU was an intriguing prospect from the start. Over the past two seasons, he’s scored the third best film grade in the country. Despite a diminutive stature, Clark has been showing up as a run defender in the box, putting to bed some size concerns about his jump to the NFL.\n\nClark has been making plays on the ball in coverage and filling gaps against the run, proving to be a do-it-all defensive back. In 2023 he played 393 snaps in the slot, but over the last two seasons he’s mixed it up evenly between slot, box and deep.\n\nClark is the ideal candidate to replace free agent Donovan Wilson for the Cowboys because he can be moved everywhere including a nickel role. Clark is rocketing up draft boards and should move into the top 100 (currently a consensus rank of 185)\n\nDeath, taxes, Bud Clark making plays at the Senior Bowl.\n\nTCU safety has been a star all week. pic.twitter.com/nm3nZWRlwP\n\n— Max Chadwick (@CFBMaxChadwick) January 29, 2026\n\nJacob Rodriguez has proven he’s every bit as advertised. The Tech standout has been everywhere on the field, picking off balls in coverage and punching out balls in the open field. In this extremely deep LB class, Rodriguez is a star.\n\nPhysical traits stand to hold him back on draft boards, but the kid is a mental giant who just makes plays. Rodriguez has set the bar at the LB position scoring the highest PFF score all time amongst Power-4 LB prospects. Given he’ll probably be a Day 2 pick, he’s going to be a steal for someone this year.\n\nTexas Tech’s Jacob Rodriguez had an all-time performance for a LB on Day 2 of the Senior Bowl. \n\nNot only did he show off his peanut punch with a forced fumble, but he also had an INT to end the day and was the best LB in coverage in one-on-ones pic.twitter.com/W8yEm4F2k7\n\n— Bobby Football (@Rob__Paul) January 29, 2026\n\nAt just under 6-foot and weighing 183 pounds, Malik Mohammad isn’t the typical tall CB the Cowboys are attracted to but he’s making it up in tenacity and stickiness at the Senior Bowl. Quick and fluid, Muhammad has shown he can stay with any build, both outside and inside.\n\nThe Cowboys are in the market for a new CB with inside ability. They felt the loss of Jourdan Lewis immensely and this prospect appears to be a great replacement option.\n\nMalik Muhammad continues to stack good rep after good rep pic.twitter.com/AQNk9J2Poz\n\n— TJ Wengert (@TJWengert) January 28, 2026\n\nYou can follow Reid on X @ReidDHanson and be sure to follow Cowboys Wire on Facebook to join in on the conversation with fellow fans!\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cowboys Wire: Midway checkpoint: 3 local Senior Bowl standouts who fit the Cowboys",

If the Raiders end up hiring Kubiak, Webb will have plenty of offensive coordinator offers.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens, Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants all requested OC interviews with Webb, and he will presumably be a candidate for Denver's own OC opening after the team fired Joe Lombardi.\n\nIn addition to Las Vegas, the Arizona Cardinals are also yet to hire a head coach, and Broncos defensive coordinator Vance Joseph is a candidate (but perhaps not the favorite) for that position. Arizona also plans to interview Kubiak this weekend, and he seems to be the top candidate for both openings. If Kubiak ends up with the Raiders, it's possible that Joseph could still be in play for the Cardinals.\n\nMeanwhile, Denver assistant head coach and defensive pass game coordinator Jim Leonhard interviewed for the Los Angeles Chargers' defensive coordinator role before L.A. hired Chris O'Leary. Leonhard is believed to be a top candidate for the Buffalo Bills' DC opening, and the Baltimore Ravens have requested a DC interview with him.\n\nIf Joseph does land the HC job in Arizona, Leonhard would presumably be a top in-house candidate to replace him with the Broncos. As it stands now, though, Joseph does not appear to be the clear favorite for the Cards' job, and Leonhard will have no shortage of suitors with DC openings.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: Denver Broncos: Davis Webb, Vance Joseph and Jim Leonhard updates",

No other team since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 has ever done that.\n\nWhat’s more, New England had to win three outdoor games in winter conditions, which got progressively worse throughout January. By the second half of the AFC title game against the Denver Broncos, the Patriots were basically playing in a blizzard.\n\nThe elements, tough defenses and pressure seemed to get to Drake Maye a bit, whose performance suffered in the postseason compared to his MVP-caliber regular season. These were the first true challenges of his career in just his second NFL season and first postseason run, and he was learning the hard way.\n\nDrake Maye: \"It's hard… Good God\"\n\nJosh McDaniels: \"Look at me, it's gonna be hard, but look, this will be the most rewarding 6 1/2 minutes of our lives if we can get it done.\" 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥\n\nThe vulnerability here… holy moly man. \n\n🎥: @Patriots pic.twitter.com/CyoaTUQpti\n\n— Michael Rodnick (@MJRodnick) January 28, 2026\n\n“Hey, it’s hard,” he told New England’s offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels late in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s game as snow rained down on them in Denver.\n\nMcDaniels, who’s in his 19th season with the Patriots coaching staff, is well aware. He’s been part of countless playoff games in tough conditions and is going to his ninth Super Bowl.\n\nFortunately for New England, he was able to help calm Maye down and give him some wise advice.\n\n“I know,” McDaniels said, laughing. “Listen to me. Look at me. It’s gonna be hard, but look, this will be the most rewarding six and a half minutes of our lives if we can get it done.”\n\nMaye took those words to heart, buckling down and finishing the job himself. He sealed the Patriots’ 10-7 win by running through the snow for a first down after the two-minute warning, punching their tickets to the Super Bowl.\n\nPatriots Predicted To Add Tight End Coming Off Eight-Touchdown Year",

The NFL Draft and free agency will both present option to better the team, and they could be in the market for another pass catcher.\n\nStefon Diggs and Mack Hollins have been great additions, but the Patriots could benefit from adding a weapon who can make plays after the catch. Drake Maye ranked outside of the top 10 in passing yards after the catch, meaning there is room to improve.\n\nYahoo Sports’ Nate Tice predicted the Patriots would draft University of Oregon tight end Kenyon Sadiq with the 31st pick of the NFL Draft.\n\n“While Sadiq is a tight end, the Patriots need pass catchers, especially ones who can create explosives with the ball in their hands,” Tice wrote on Tuesday. “Offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels loves to use tight ends, and Maye has loved throwing the ball to Hunter Henry in his first two seasons. Sadiq would give them a weapon who can turn those screens and underneath routes into big plays. He has the speed and receiving ability to stretch the defense, and also some real grit as a blocker that Mike Vrabel would love.”\n\nSadiq had 560 yards on 51 receptions last season. He scored eight touchdowns as well. In three seasons at Oregon, he had 892 yards and 11 receiving touchdowns. He averaged 11.2 yards per reception in college.\n\nHe led Oregon in receiving touchdowns and was third on the team in receiving yards per game. At 6-foot-3, 245 pounds, he may be undersized for a tight end, but he has tremendous speed and can be a difference maker for the Patriots.\n\nWhat Josh McDaniels Told Drake Maye To Seal Patriots’ AFC Championship",

In nine games, he threw for 1,259 yards and only 7 touchdowns.\n\nNew York will likely be looking for a new starting quarterback this offseason, and CBS Sports NFL writer Joel Corry thinks the Jets could move Fields this offseason.\n\n“The Jets signed Fields to a two-year, $40 million deal with $30 million fully guaranteed as an unrestricted free agent last March in the hopes that he would be more than a bridge quarterback,” Corry wrote on Wednesday. “Fields’ preseason struggles were dismissed rather than seen as a warning sign after he played well against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the regular season opener.\n\n“It was downhill for the 2021 first-round pick after the Steelers game. Fields had a dubious distinction in a Week 6 loss to the Broncos. He was sacked nine times in producing a franchise-worst minus-10 net passing yards. Fields was benched nine games into the season.”\n\nThere’s a possibility that the Steelers could reunite with Fields this offseason, especially if Aaron Rodgers doesn’t come back.

    "fullText": "You'll be hard-pressed to find a large majority of Americans who agree with one another on the same subject in 2026, but the Bill Belichick's Hall of Fame snub seems to be doing just that – and even the ever-divisive President of the United States is weighing in on the matter.\n\nDonald Trump took to Truth Social on Wednesday to share his thoughts on Belichick after he was snubbed from the 2026 Pro Football Hall of Fame class. Belichick, a 29-year NFL head-coaching veteran with six Super Bowl rings, was considered a first-ballot selection by most fans. Still, we learned on Tuesday that he did not receive enough votes to be inducted in his first year of eligibility.\n\nTrump is considered a rather controversial figure these days, but his opinion on the matter seemed to be right in line with most of the NFL fanbase as he blasted the decision on social media. He also took shots in the same post at what he describes as the 'sissy' kickoff rule, referring to the new Dynamic Kickoff Rule implemented by the league ahead of the 2024 season.\n\n𝗕𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴: President Donald Trump went OFF on the NFL voters defending his close friend Bill Belichick should've been a first ballot Hall of Famer.\n\n“It is the same mindset that gave pro football the unwatchable 'Sissy' Kickoff Rule, that made it possible for Bill to not… pic.twitter.com/qMwbJcJmCH\n\n— Dov Kleiman (@NFL_DovKleiman) January 28, 2026\n\n“It is the same mindset that gave pro football the new and unwatchable ‘Sissy’ Kickoff Rule, that made it possible for Bill Belichick to not be elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame,” Trump wrote Wednesday. “Both are ridiculous and should be overturned!”\n\nIt is not Trump's first time criticizing moves regarding the NFL and its personnel, calling the new kickoff rule 'ridiculous' in 2025. Recently, Trump announced he wouldn't attend Super Bowl LX in San Francisco because it is \"too far away,\" while blasting the scheduled musical performances by Bad Bunny and Green Day.\n\n“I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred.

A day later, an important point of clarification has emerged.\n\nPolian, after saying he voted for Belichick before saying he can't say with 100 percent certainty whether he did, says he did indeed vote for his former New England nemesis.\n\n“I voted for coach Belichick in the Hall of Fame selection meeting,” Polian said in an appearance on SiriusXM NFL Radio, after explaining he was reading from a prepared statement. “The Pro Football Hall of Fame has confirmed that fact through the auditors of the selection process. Again, I’ll state that I never said that I believe that Coach Belichick should quote, wait a year, close quote, for enshrinement. This has been confirmed by the Pro Football Hall of Fame, numerous selectors who were in the room, and my vote for coach Belichick. As a Hall of Fame member and selector, I realize the import of what we do. I’ve always tried as a selector to make these difficult choices with the utmost of objectivity. I’ve said on SiriusXM Radio and numerous other media outlets that I believe Coach Belichick to be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, my vote confirms that.”\n\nUltimately, it doesn't matter. Not enough of the voters voted for Belichick. At least 11 of 50 failed to include Belichick among three selections from a group that included Belichick, Patriots owner Robert Kraft, and seniors candidates Ken Anderson, Roger Craig, and L.C.

    "fullText": "While the New England Patriots prepare for their 12th Super Bowl appearance, their former head coach Bill Belichick - widely considered to be the greatest professional football coach of all time - finds himself in an unlikely position: defending his legacy.\n\nAlthough Belichick has the most Super Bowl victories in NFL history, he received a phone call on Friday notifying him he would not be inducted into this year's Pro Football Hall of Fame class.\n\n\"Six Super Bowls isn't enough?\" Belichick asked with disappointment, according to ESPN which broke the news, referring to his six wins with the Patriots.\n\nThe latest setback adds to a series of misfortunes for Belichick, who ended his nearly 50-year NFL coaching career on a losing streak, and, in a rather unexpected decision, left the pinnacle of American football to coach college students.\n\nJust a few months ago, Belichick made his college football debut to a sell-out crowd of over 50,000 people packed into University of North Carolina's football stadium.\n\nWhen he walked onto the field for the first time, the roar of tens of thousands of screaming fans erupted into the night sky.\n\nThe Tar Heels suffered a stinging defeat to the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs that night, and never quite recovered. By the end of the 12-game season, the team finished with just four wins – its worst record since 2018.\n\nThe paradox between Belichick's legendary NFL career and his spectacularly poor first year in college football is complicating his legacy. After nearly 50 years coaching professional football, why Belichick accepted an offer to step down to the amateur leagues remains a big question. When he will quit is becoming an even bigger one.\n\n\"He's going to have one of the biggest challenges of his coaching career trying to get year two to be better than year one in North Carolina,\" said Dan Roche, an award-winning sports anchor with the BBC's US media partner, CBS News.\n\n\"If they struggle again, I think that will basically be the end of the coaching career of Bill Belichick,\" he continued.\n\nFor years, the trend in college football has been that coaches typically leave the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for greater prestige and bigger salaries in the NFL.\n\nBut the college league – which generates over $1.3bn (£940.5m) in revenue – is starting to catch up.\n\n\"North Carolina decided to roll the dice and invest a lot of money in its football program,\" said Greg Barnes, senior reporter at Inside Carolina, a website dedicated to North Carolina University sports.\n\nAnd with that came Belichick, who signed a five-year $50m (£36m) deal to join the Tar Heels.\n\n\"That kind of money is unheard of for North Carolina football,\" Barnes said, notwithstanding that the contract went to 73-year-old Belichick who previously had never coached a single game of college football.\n\nMost sports experts who've followed his career suspect he's not in it for the money.\n\nFor Belichick, they say, it's part love of the game, part love for coaching, and part an affliction that has ailed many great sports figures: an inability to know when to say goodbye.\n\n\"I can't recall many head coaches who have said, 'Okay, I've done it all, and now I'm going to walk away',\" Roche said. \"I just think they don't have it in them.\"\n\nBelichick was born into a football family.\n\nHis father, Steve Belichick, had a long college coaching career, including 30 years at the US Naval Academy and two years at North Carolina.\n\nThe younger Belichick's understanding of football was also nurtured by his mother, Jeannette, with whom he spent many weekends watching games on TV.\n\nBelichick played football and lacrosse at Wesleyan University where he graduated in 1975 with an economics degree. Having never played in the professional league, he began his NFL career that same year as a staff assistant.\n\n\"He doesn't look like a football coach. He's not an overwhelming physical presence. He's not a screamer,\" said ESPN senior writer Seth Wickersham. \"He's kind of a quirky, introverted thinker.\"\n\n\"And he revolutionised professional football,\" Wickersham said.\n\nHowever, he truly forged his legacy during his decades-long career as the New England Patriots head coach.\n\nHe joined the team in 2000. One year later, with the help of quarterback Tom Brady, they won their first Super Bowl. Then five more after that. Altogether, the Brady-and-Belichick-led Patriots appeared in the Super Bowl nine times, the most under any single head coach in NFL history .\n\nMike Reiss, an ESPN staff writer who covers the Patriots, attributed Belichick's success to being \"a master strategist\".\n\n\"When he was at his peak powers, he almost knew the opposition more than the opposition knew themselves,\" Reiss said.\n\nBelichick's critics point to a series of scandals that rocked the Patriots during his tenure, including in 2007 when he was fined $500,000 (£362,000) for ordering his staff to spy on other teams, and in 2016, when Brady was suspended for four games for deflating footballs to his advantage.\n\nIn 2020, Brady left the Patriots, reportedly in part due to Belichick's unwillingness to give Brady, then-aged 43, the longer contract Brady wanted.\n\nBrady joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers the same year and won his seventh Super Bowl. In Belichick's final two seasons with the Patriots, he led the team to one of its worst records since the 1990s.\n\nBelichick and the Patriots mutually agreed to part ways in January 2024. He was unable to find another NFL team to take him after that.\n\n\"It was a stunning rebuke by the NFL,\" said Wickersham, author of New York Times bestseller It's Better to be Feared: The New England Patriots Dynasty and the Pursuit of Greatness.\n\n\"For the first time since 1975\", Wickersham said, \"Belichick was out of football\".\n\nIt was during one of the lowest points of Belichick's professional career that he received the call from North Carolina.\n\nOutside of a few sceptics, college football fans were engulfed in enthusiasm.\n\n\"Congrats coach,\" Tom Brady posted on social media. \"The Tar Heel way is about to become a thing 100.\"\n\nWith his name emblazoned on merchandise, home-game tickets for the entire season sold out weeks before it started.\n\nBut Belichick was unable to reverse the bad fortune that appeared to follow him from his final years in the NFL.\n\nAfter their defeat in game one, the Tar Heels would go on to lose most games, including every match against their three in-state rivals, something the team hadn't done since 1989.\n\nAs the season losses piled up, so did the number of empty seats inside North Carolina's football stadium.\n\nFor some, like North Carolina Alumni Association member Deborah Melvin, it was painful to witness even from home.\n\n\"It was just disheartening,\" she said. \"He was supposed to be Mr Super Coach.\"\n\nAdding to fans' frustrations was the incessant press coverage of Belichick's romantic relationship with Jordon Hudson, a 24-year-old beauty pageant contestant and amateur cheerleader.\n\nWickersham called it \"the most scrutinized relationship ever for an American sports coach\".\n\nHudson made headlines. Lots of headlines. Like when she was rumoured to have been banned from North Carolina's athletic facilities and the university had to put out a statement saying she wasn't. Or the time when she appeared next to Belichick on the sidelines on game day wearing a reptile mini-skirt and knee-high boots. Or the time when she filed a trademark application for the term \"gold digger\".\n\nBelichick couldn't avoid the gossip columns either, making his own headlines amid multiple appearances at Hudson's cheerleading competitions and beauty pageants.\n\nWickersham said he found the Belichick-Hudson saga to be \"surprising\", adding that it contributed to the noise surrounding Belichick who previously \"was a master at limiting distractions\".\n\n\"It's definitely different than the Belichick who was with New England all those years,\" Wickersham said.\n\nThe university declined a request from the BBC to interview Belichick.\n\nThe Tar Heels' bad season has not been blamed on Hudson, though. It was a variety of other factors.\n\nThis was Belichick's first time coaching a college football team, a group composed of a bunch of teenagers with often much steeper learning curves compared to the pros of the NFL.\n\nThe other major challenge was recruiting. Belichick joined the Tar Heels after the deadline for high school athletes to accept their college offers. That meant he missed the chance to persuade some of America's best high school football talent to join his team this year.\n\n\"To get the system in place is more than just turning a light switch on,\" North Carolina football manager Mike Lombardi said after the season.\n\n\"I'm not making any excuses, but when we first got here, we didn't have time to turn the light switch on,\" he said. \"We had to just get into the dark room.\"\n\nLombardi's remarks came during a signing ceremony on 3 December, as the team celebrated the new class of recruits joining the Tar Heels' next season.\n\n\"They will be a foundation of our program,\" Belichick said.\n\nFor now, quitting does not appear to be an option for the all-time great coach.\n\n\"'Why are you still doing this? You could be doing anything,'\" Weiss said he once asked Belichick toward the end of his career with the Patriots. \"And he replied, 'It beats working.'\n\n\"I'll never forget that, because I feel like this is what he feels like he was born to do.\"",

    "description": "Todd Monken's hire by the Browns leaves only two NFL head-coaching vacancies left. But which additions were the best moves?",
    "fullText": "One of the wildest NFL coaching carousels in league history is finally approaching a standstill.\n\nWith 10 head-coaching vacancies popping up, the onset of the offseason was far more active than anyone could have anticipated. But after the Cleveland Browns' hiring of Todd Monken on Wednesday, Jan. 28, all but two openings – those of the Arizona Cardinals and Las Vegas Raiders – have been filled, and the initial rush for the top candidates is long over.\n\nGiven the myriad unknowns and extenuating circumstances when assessing what went right or wrong at the very top for any team, evaluating head-coaching hires can be notoriously difficult. With that said, here is our initial ranking of all the coaching hires so far:\n\nOn Black Monday, it seemed as though this year's candidate pool lacked the equivalent of a Mike Vrabel or Ben Johnson. One day later, John Harbaugh was thrown into the mix and became the clear headliner.\n\nExpecting the former Ravens coach to replicate what the New England Patriots or Chicago Bears achieved in Year 1 of their new regimes would be unreasonable. Still, Harbaugh's track record – just three losing seasons in 18 years – is the stuff of dreams for a Giants franchise tied for the fewest wins since 2017 (44).\n\nHarbaugh was the one option this cycle who looked capable of flipping an organization's culture, even if it required some uncomfortable shifts. Given how set in their ways the Giants have been, the transformation might not take place overnight. But Big Blue has seen sharp play-callers flame out, so inspiring hope was going to necessitate finding someone capable of addressing the very core of the organization.\n\nIn Harbaugh, they now have that.\n\nParting with Harbaugh only to turn to a family disciple might seem like a strange move. But in hiring Jesse Minter, Baltimore can hold onto much of what worked for the previous regime while still finding a fresh voice and direction for the franchise.\n\nWidely lauded for both his schematic acumen and his ability to connect with others, Minter already has an extensive track record of bringing along young players. That no doubt was a major draw for a Ravens team with a top-heavy roster and a firm commitment to developing home-grown talent. In Los Angeles, Minter's remaking of the defense took hold almost instantly. The Ravens might be due for a bit more upheaval on that side of the ball than they're accustomed to, but Minter could help the franchise return to its roots. At the very least, he can help the unit cut down on the considerable number of lapses that became an unfortunate running theme last season.\n\nOf course, that fails to address a pretty crucial factor: Who guides Lamar Jackson and the offense? Securing the right offensive play-caller is one of the vital early steps for Minter, and succeeding on that front might necessitate finding another answer in a year or two if his coordinator of choice flourishes and earns head-coaching consideration. But there are several promising options available, all of whom should be eager to join this staff and work with a two-time NFL MVP in Jackson.\n\nGiven owner Arthur Blank's impatience in ending the league's second-longest active playoff drought, Harbaugh understandably would have been the big prize here. But landing a two-time NFL Coach of the Year should be more than a satisfactory outcome for the Falcons.\n\nIt's fair to wonder how much blame Kevin Stefanski bears for an 8-26 record in his final two years with the Cleveland Browns. There's no questioning his resourcefulness, though, and that trait should come in handy as he takes on a far less imposing undertaking than the one he had been saddled with. His wide-zone scheme is bound to be a boon for All-Pro running back Bijan Robinson, and he can help compensate for the lack of wide receiver threats beyond Drake London.\n\nThe hiccup here could be in the potential disconnect between Stefanski's tendencies and quarterback Michael Penix Jr.'s strengths, which haven't included attacking the middle of the field, working from under center or operating with reliable precision. Stefanski might have been best off coming aboard two years ago, when the team was first finding its way with his former pupil, Kirk Cousins. But Atlanta couldn't afford to center its coaching search on Penix, who is coming off a torn anterior cruciate ligament.\n\nMaybe this isn't an outright moon shot. Yet with the NFC South still looking eminently winnable, this feels like substantial progress toward at least joining the conference's second tier of contenders. Bonus points, too, for retaining defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich, who revved up the long-dormant pass rush and helped several young defenders break out in 2025.\n\nPerhaps feeling some pangs of remorse after parting with Mike Vrabel and giving an unproven entity in Brian Callahan a shot, the Titans went hard at second-time head coaches this cycle. In all, 14 of the 18 candidates they interviewed had prior experience running a franchise. With Robert Saleh, Tennessee ended up doling out a second chance to someone who has shown enough to indicate things might go smoother than they did in his first go-around.\n\nPerhaps the optics weren't great in the early going, as the first three hires this cycle all materialized ahead of scheduled visits with the Titans. But credit Tennessee for not being overly rigid in its process, which many assumed would be focused on pairing 2025 No. 1 pick Cam Ward with an offensive play-caller for a head coach.\n\nSaleh did superlative work in keeping a San Francisco 49ers defense ravaged by injuries afloat, and his plan to hang onto defensive play-calling duties while serving as head coach should facilitate an expedited turnaround on that side of the ball. Though his first stop featured plenty of mishaps with cultural development and locker room management, Saleh surely took away some lessons in what not to do at his next opportunity. And in bringing on former Giants head coach Brian Daboll as offensive coordinator to guide Ward's development, he's gotten off to a promising start in establishing a framework for the franchise to actually compete for the first time since Vrabel's firing.\n\nWith Tennessee having an estimated league-high $93.5 million in cap space, according to Over The Cap, and few promising pieces beyond Ward, Saleh at least sizes up as someone who should prove skillful in building from the ground floor.\n\nIn a vacuum, Joe Brady is a perfectly qualified candidate who would invigorate plenty of franchises. He entered the season as one of the most prominent names on the market after deciding to stay put last winter, and his play-calling acumen might be unmatched in a thin pool of offensive-minded options.\n\nBut any assessment of the Bills' hire has to take into account the circumstances of their puzzling firing of Sean McDermott and the even more baffling justification put forth by owner Terry Pegula and general manager Brandon Beane. Now, after giving every indication that the team needs to get over the \"proverbial playoff wall\" that Pegula referenced, the franchise is turning to ... a first-time head coach – and, at 36, the youngest in the NFL – who was interwoven with the issues that Pegula and Beane seemed to cite as grounds for McDermott's dismissal.\n\nPegula seemed to center Josh Allen throughout the process, including having the quarterback shape the search for McDermott's replacement. Viewed through that lens, Brady makes ample sense for Buffalo after he proved capable of orchestrating a versatile attack despite several glaring personnel limitations, particularly at receiver.\n\nPerhaps the Bills took a look around at their external options and simply weren't moved by any of the choices. (It's worth noting that they were unable to speak with Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak given the timing of McDermott's firing and the Seahawks' Super Bowl run.) But after crowing about the need for change, why skew so heavily toward the familiar?\n\nThere's clearly considerable upside for Brady here, but the challenge facing him is immense. Not only must he figure out a way to push Allen and the offense forward after the unit ranked fourth in both total yards and points in 2025, but he'll have to do so while taking on a host of unfamiliar game-management and big-picture responsibilities. Meanwhile, who leads a defense that experienced worse talent atrophy than Beane might like to admit? The cap situation – Buffalo is currently projected to be nearly $14 million overdrawn, according to Over The Cap – is also a little foreboding for a team that has several key pending free agents worth keeping – and several more who should be brought in.\n\nThere's a solid chance that the Bills can be a playoff mainstay and top-tier AFC contender under Brady. The problem for him, however, is that Buffalo has made clear that those accomplishments won't suffice.\n\nBut there's a bit more of an unknown element to him than there is for others on this list.\n\nHafley managed to revitalize the Packers' defense almost immediately upon his arrival. His creativity in navigating the unit's deficiencies at various points augurs well for a team that presents a plethora of its own shortcomings. The Dolphins could also stand to benefit from a shift in accountability after repeatedly reverting to finger-pointing under Mike McDaniel.\n\nStill, this is a lot to take on for someone whose only prior head-coaching experience was at Boston College. The Dolphins probably made the shrewd move in riding things out with a fresh face rather than expecting a retread hire to turn things around right away. But Hafley might have a harder time than some of his peers in filling out a staff capable of accounting for all his blind spots as he takes the wheel. The promotion of Bobby Slowik to offensive coordinator seems like a risky move given the pervasive protection problems he couldn't solve during his run as the Houston Texans' coordinator.\n\nAfter Mike Tomlin's resignation, chairman Art Rooney II made clear the Steelers wouldn't be undergoing a rebuild. And here's the proof.\n\nIn hiring the 62-year-old McCarthy, who has a career 60.8% winning percentage and a Super Bowl title on his résumé but little postseason success to speak of in the last decade, Pittsburgh proved it prized steady stewardship above all. On some level, that's understandable for a franchise that hasn't known what it's like to be truly out of the playoff hunt in the last 20 years. McCarthy has also demonstrated he's still a savvy play-caller − his 2022 and '23 offenses ranked fourth and first in scoring, respectively − who has unparalleled experience in leading storied organizations after his runs with the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys.\n\nBut unlike the Giants, the Steelers aren't a team needing the floor to be raised. Pittsburgh has taken up residence in the AFC's second tier without much of a threat of breaking through to the first, with its postseason win drought now standing at nine seasons.\n\nIt's difficult to see how McCarthy changes that dynamic much, even if the baseline doesn't stray too far from a .500 mark. And while the stellar quarterback play that has accompanied his past two stops might be seen as a major draw for a franchise facing plenty of uncertainty behind center, there's not much to suggest he has a substantial advantage over the field in developing a young passer − a task the Steelers desperately need to embrace but might again resist.\n\nPerhaps the most problematic element of this decision was the stretch run of the process. Pittsburgh held virtual interviews with both Los Angeles Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula − considered by many to be a leading candidate for the role − and Rams passing game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase. But rather than wait until after the NFC championship game for the opportunity to speak in person with both, the Steelers plowed ahead with McCarthy, who hadn't been in the mix for any of the other remaining vacancies. This was the perfect opportunity for Pittsburgh to step back and consider the full scope of its options. Instead, it opted for the familiar and unthreatening choice.\n\nIn the past few years, two of the more notable respectability plays for hires − the Las Vegas Raiders turning to Pete Carroll last year and the Jacksonville Jaguars going to Doug Pederson in 2022 − have flamed out. McCarthy likely won't go bust at the scale that the former did. But this sure feels like a missed opportunity to make up ground on the conference's actual contenders by a franchise more concerned with the prospect of ceding it.\n\nConsider this placement not so much an indictment of Todd Monken as everything Cleveland has done to get to this point.\n\nAs the Ravens' offensive coordinator, Monken proved adept at employing an innovative approach to invigorate what had been a stagnant passing game. Under his watch, the Ravens ranked third and fourth in scoring in the two seasons prior to 2025, when Lamar Jackson's injury and a host of other setbacks muddled the picture for Baltimore. That creativity will surely be needed as Cleveland looks to compensate for massive deficiencies along its offensive line and in its receiving corps. And that's to say nothing of the great unknown behind center.\n\nStill, Monken, who turns 60 next week, is one of the oldest first-time head coaching hires in recent NFL history. And from the three weeks the Browns went in between firing two-time NFL Coach of the Year Kevin Stefanski and settling on his replacement, the franchise served up plenty of reminders of why this job is so daunting.\n\nIn total, three candidates – Jesse Minter, later hired as the Baltimore Ravens' head coach; Mike McDaniel, who settled on becoming the Los Angeles Chargers' offensive coordinator; and Grant Udinski, who opted to remain the Jacksonville Jaguars' offensive coordinator – dropped out of consideration for the role. Per multiple reports, Cleveland's search was colored by a desire to retain defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz, a favorite of owner Jimmy Haslam, in some capacity. With Schwartz losing out on the top role, however, NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported that it was unlikely he would return to the new staff.\n\nHaving served as the team's offensive coordinator in Freddie Kitchens' disastrous one-year run in 2019, Monken is familiar with the Browns' rampant dysfunction. Maybe that will serve him well as he takes on one of the NFL's most imposing jobs. But it seems clear that the Browns' shift away from Stefanski lacked much of a vision for where the organization wanted to end up.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: NFL coach hirings 2026: Ranking every hire as Browns add Todd Monken",

    "fullText": "In light of Shedeur Sanders being added to the AFC Pro Bowl roster yesterday as a replacement quarterback, we decided to take a look at the other Colorado Buffaloes who have earned NFL Pro Bowl honors, either as original selections or alternates. Sanders becomes just the second quarterback in program history to make a Pro Bowl, joining Kordell Stewart, who was selected in 2001. He is also only the fourth Colorado player to be named to the Pro Bowl since 2010, alongside LT David Bakhtiari, RB Phillip Lindsay, and OL Andre Gurode.\n\nIn total, 19 Colorado Buffaloes have gone on to become NFL Pro Bowlers.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 12 games played, three interceptions for 13 return yards, 3 fumbles recovered (1959); 12 games played, one interception for 14 return yards (1960).\n\nBrookshier was a standout three-year letterman at the University of Colorado, excelling as a defensive back, fullback, and return specialist. He finished his career with six interceptions and led the nation in punt returns in 1951, averaging 12.0 yards per return.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 14 games played, three interceptions for 41 return yards.\n\nDove was an exceptional running back and defensive back for the University of Colorado from 1956 to 1958. A key contributor in the single-wing offense, he rushed for more than 1,200 yards over his final two seasons and was selected in the third round of the 1959 NFL Draft.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: Was one of the top guards in the NFL and helped Cleveland running backs Jim Brown and Leroy Kelly have historic seasons.\n\nWooten became just the fifth player in Colorado history to earn All-America honors and the first lineman to do so when he was recognized in 1958. A three-year letterman at guard from 1956 to 1958, he was named an All-American by the AFCA in his senior season, following a first-team All-Big Seven selection as a junior the year before.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 14 games played, 44 receptions, 610 receiving yards, four touchdowns (1965); 14 games played, 54 receptions, 836 receiving yards, four touchdowns (1967).\n\nAlthough listed as a quarterback, Dowler was a versatile \"triple-threat\" in Dal Ward's single-wing offense. He caught 41 passes for 628 yards and six touchdowns, threw for 769 yards and seven scores, and averaged 43.6 yards per punt. On defense, he intercepted 10 passes, the second-most in school history at the time. A three-time All-Big Seven selection and honorable mention All-American in 1958, Dowler was later inducted into both the CU Athletic Hall of Fame and the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: Three interceptions for 34 return yards, led the NFL with 5 fumble recoveries and scored one defensive touchdown (1972); Anderson had his peak year in 1973, leading the NFL with 8 interceptions for 163 yards and adding two pick-six touchdowns. In 1974, his numbers dipped, but he still earned Pro Bowl recognition, finishing with one interception for 14 yards.\n\nAnderson earned consensus All-American honors in 1967 and was known for his versatility on the field. He finished his college career with 14 interceptions and 266 tackles, setting school records at the time. In recognition of his outstanding achievements, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1993.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 14 games played, 51 catches, 983 receiving yards, nine touchdowns (1975); 14 games played, 46 catches, 1,111 receiving yards, 12 touchdowns (1976); 13 games played, 33 catches, 540 receiving yards, six touchdowns (1977); 16 games played, 49 catches, 709 receiving yards, one touchdown (1978).\n\nIn 22 games at Colorado, Branch caught 36 passes for 665 yards and 11 touchdowns while rushing 31 times for 354 yards and five scores, averaging 11.4 yards per carry. Renowned for his blazing speed, he recorded 11 plays of 59 yards or longer during his time in Boulder.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: Played in 16 games and had eight interceptions and three touchdowns (1978). In 1989, he played 16 games, recording five interceptions and a touchdown.\n\nPerry earned All-Big Eight Conference honors and was named an honorable mention All-American in 1974. Known for his speed, he was a key contributor on defense for the Buffaloes before being selected in the 1975 NFL Draft.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: Tackles were not officially recorded, but Johnson was a force and anchored the Eagles' defensive line during this three-year Pro Bowl stint.\n\nIn 1976, the Associated Press (AP) selected Johnson to the first-team All-Big Eight, and he was an honorable mention All-American. He received Colorado's Dave Jones award as the team's most valuable defensive lineman.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: Nine games, one interception (shortened 1982 season); 15 games, three interceptions (1983); 15 games, seven interceptions, two fumble recoveries\n\nAt the time of his graduation, Haynes' 256 career tackles ranked second all-time for a defensive back at Colorado, and his 17 pass deflections were tied for seventh. Known for his speed, running a 4.4-second 40-yard dash, he made a lasting impact on the field and was later named a first-team member of CU's All-Century team in 1989.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 56 total tackles, 13 sacks, three forced fumbles and a fumble recovery\n\nWilliams won the 1990 Butkus Award and led the Buffs to a national championship. A two-time Big Eight Defensive Player of the Year, he finished as CU's all-time leader in sacks (35) and tackles for loss (59), later earning College Football Hall of Fame honors.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 16 games, 48 total tackles, one sack and one fumble recovery\n\nHe was second-team All-Conference as a sophomore, first-team all-Big Eight as a junior, and a second-team All-American selection as a senior. Steed ranks tied for 22nd on CU's all-time sacks list and 19th in tackles for a loss.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 81 tackles, 13.0 sacks, three forced fumbles, two interceptions (1996); 149 tackles, 7.5 sacks, one interception, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery (1998); 116 tackles, 5.5 sacks, six passes defended, two forced fumbles (1999)\n\nHe ended his career as Colorado's fourth all-time leading tackler with 369 stops, ranked third all-time in solo tackles with 242, and fourth in tackles for loss with 38. He played inside linebacker as a freshman and sophomore before moving to the outside, where he recorded 14 quarterback sacks over the next two seasons.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 60.2 percent completion rate, 3,109 passing yards, 14 touchdowns, 11 interceptions; 96 carries, 537 yards, five touchdowns\n\nStewart finished his career as Colorado's leader in both total offense and passing yards with 6,481, and through 2017, he still ranked second and fourth in those categories. His 27-5-1 record as a starter, an 83.3 winning percentage, remains the best in CU history for any quarterback. He was named first-team All-Big Eight as a senior in 1994 and received the Zack Jordan Award as the Buffs' most valuable player, leading Colorado to an 11-1 record and a number three national ranking.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: Started 16 games, recorded 90 tackles, one interception, 12 passes defended and two forced fumbles\n\nAt Colorado, as a senior, he was a unanimous All-Big 12 Conference first-team choice, earned third-team All-America honors, and was a semi-finalist for the Jim Thorpe Award, given to the nation's top defensive back. He led the team with 112 tackles and five interceptions, one of which he returned for a touchdown. He also holds the school record with 6.5 career sacks for a defensive back.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 16 games started, average of 45.3 yards per punt, 66 total punts for 2,987 yards (1999);16 games started, 44.4 yards per punt, 81 total punts for 3,595 yards.\n\nBerger played three seasons at Colorado, where he served as the team's punter and kicker, contributing to the team before being drafted by the NFL in the sixth round.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: Earned five consecutive Pro Bowl selections (2006-2010) as a center for the Dallas Cowboys. He served as a durable anchor on this offensive line, starting all 16 games in 2008, 2009 and 2010.\n\nAt Colorado, Gurode was a first-team All-Big 12 selection in 2000 and 2001, and was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American as a senior in 2001. During his career, he allowed just 7.5 sacks in 2,653 plays as a starter for the Buffaloes.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 15 games, 1,037 rushing yards, nine touchdowns; 35 receptions for 241 yards and one touchdown\n\nLindsay became Colorado's all-time leader in all-purpose yards with 5,760 and yards from scrimmage with 4,683, totals that rise to 5,926 and 4,849, including the 2016 Alamo Bowl. He finished as the Buffs' second all-time leading rusher with 3,707 yards and was the first player in CU history to record back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons, and only the second to do so over any two seasons. With 110 receptions for 976 yards, he also set school records for the most catches and receiving yards by a running back. Lindsay became the 14th player to join CU's 500/500 Club for rushing and receiving yards, narrowly missing the milestone of 1,000 in both categories.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: Started 16 games, allowing only 4 sacks (2016); Started 16 games, earning his second-team All-Pro honors (2019); Started 12 games, allowing only one sack and one quarterback hit, with a 91.8 Pro Football Focus pass-blocking grade before a torn ACL (2020).\n\nA two-time second-team All-Pac 12 selection (2011, 2012) and a 2012 team captain, he was known for his durability and high-grade efficiency, allowing only two-and-a-half sacks in his final season.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 8 games started, 1,400 passing yards, 8 total touchdowns, 10 interceptions\n\nSander finished his 24-start Colorado career 651-of-907 (71.8%) with 7,364 yards, 64 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions. He broke over 100 school records and finished third in passing yards, fifth in attempts, third in completions, first in passing touchdowns, and tops in QB rating.\n\nWith Shedeur Sanders earning his spot as a replacement, the hope is that Colorado can continue to produce more NFL talent and, more importantly, legitimate NFL stars. Entering the 2025 NFL season, 12 former Buffaloes were on active NFL rosters. Those are numbers Deion Sanders is clearly aiming to grow in 2026 and beyond.\n\nContact/Follow us @BuffaloesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook for ongoing coverage of Colorado news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Buffaloes Wire: Every Colorado football player to make an NFL Pro Bowl",

    "fullText": "The LSU Tigers have concluded their football season and while they focus on next year's team, their now former players are focusing on the NFL draft.\n\nAfter an impressive showing in the 2026 East-West Shrine Bowl, former Tigers wideout Chris Hilton Jr. has been a late add to the 2026 Senior Bowl roster, per WAFB's Jacques Doucet.\n\nMany scouts at the Shrine Bowl praised the performance of Hilton. It's no surprise, given that this is an environment built for someone like him to excel. The defense is at a disadvantage and he has speed for days.\n\nThe Zachary product came to Baton Rouge as a highly sought-after recruit. He was the No. 58 overall player in his class, fifth-best wideout and third in Louisiana. His ceiling always felt sky high.\n\nA number of unfortunate injuries and circumstances kept Hilton from really ever getting the opportunity to perform at LSU. He finished his career with 41 catches for 780 yards and six touchdowns. He had a career average of 19 yards per reception.\n\nIf he can stay healthy, he certainly has enough to offer an NFL team for a shot. At the very least, he has the speed for it.\n\nBeing brought over from the Shrine Bowl to the Senior Bowl is a big deal. There were 106 Senior Bowl players drafted last season. That's over 41% of the draft. He will have the chance to compete in two practices before the game and the chance to meet with every single NFL team.\n\nThis would be a fantastic journey to the league if Hilton can continue to impress.",

    "description": "The Super Bowl is in 13 days, but first, the NFL draft community has plenty of time to produce mock […]",
    "fullText": "The Super Bowl is in 13 days, but first, the NFL draft community has plenty of time to produce mock drafts, as seven rounds of new rookies will join the big leagues in three months. And according to NFL.com, the latest and greatest theory for the Minnesota Vikings involves Toledo safety Emmanuel McNeil-Warren.\n\nMcNeil-Warren’s name is rising as a rookie safety option, and the Smith succession question may force Minnesota’s hand.\n\nMcNeil-Warren ranks 39th on the Consensus Big Board as of January 27th, but that didn’t stop Daniel Jeremiah from mock-drafting him to the purple team.\n\nA Harrison Smith replacement is on the mind of NFL.com.\n\nAt the 18th pick, Jeremiah picked McNeil-Warren for Minnesota and noted, “I’m higher on McNeil-Warren than some other people around the league, but I love his combination of size and explosive playmaking ability. He could help replace Harrison Smith if the soon-to-be 37-year-old does indeed retire.”\n\nBefore the Vikings’ pick, Jeremiah mocked Akheem Mesidor, an EDGE rusher from Miami, to the Detroit Lions, and at No. 19, Arizona State wideout Jordan Tyson landed with the Carolina Panthers.\n\nNaturally, as you will see in every mock draft, Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza went No. 1 overall to the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nMcNeil-Warren is 6’2″ and 202 pounds with 4.5 speed. He’s got the size. The Toledo Rocket is known for forcing turnovers, which the Vikings could obviously use in 2026 and beyond. He also has the length, burst, and ability worthy of the 1st Round, though general managers often don’t consider safeties as premium assets, like cornerbacks.\n\nNFL Draft Buzz on McNeil-Warren: “His combination of length, improving instincts, and proven ability to generate game-changing plays positions him as the type of safety who could thrive in a role-specific capacity early before expanding his responsibilities.”\n\n“The modern NFL’s emphasis on versatile defensive backs who can match up with tight ends and provide run support from depth aligns perfectly with his skill set, though defensive coordinators will need patience developing his deep coverage reliability. His ceiling depends heavily on continued refinement of his anticipation and pattern recognition – the mental processing that separates good college safeties from NFL starters.”\n\nAnother Toledo defensive back took off after being drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2024: cornerback Quinyon Mitchell.\n\nNBD added on McNeill-Warren, “The flashes are there, particularly his pick-six against Western Kentucky that demonstrated his growth reading quarterback intentions, but consistency remains elusive. Teams running primarily split-safety coverages where he can work from depth and leverage his closing speed downhill would maximize his immediate impact while minimizing exposure to his weaknesses in isolated deep coverage situations.”\n\n“While he may never become an elite single-high free safety, McNeil-Warren possesses the tools and competitive drive to carve out a decade-long career as a valuable chess piece in creative defensive schemes that value versatility and playmaking over pure coverage ability.”\n\nThe Job Lewis Cine Should’ve Filled\n\nIt’s worth noting that the Vikings shouldn’t need safety right now. The here and now was supposed to be the time that 2022 1st-Rounder Lewis Cine entered his prime. But after Cine broke his leg as a rookie and never gained his footing in the defense thereafter, Minnesota dropped Cine a couple of offseasons ago, one of the worst busts in Vikings history.\n\nCine now plays in the UFL, along with high-round 2022 draft mate, cornerback Andrew Booth.\n\nHad general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah hit on Cine, he would not have to entertain a high-round draft pick on a safety like McNeill-Warren. That’s why draft busts are so impactful and damning.\n\nNot So Fast on Smith’s Retirement?\n\nMinnesota extended defensive coordinator Brian Flores’s contract last week, nominating him for a return in 2026. And while fans had a going-away party for Harrison Smith a few weeks ago in Week 18, a source told VikingsTerritory last weekend that Smith’s retirement is not a foregone conclusion. The 36-year-old has a “hard time walking away,” per the source, and Flores’s renewal with the Vikings could lure Smith back for Year No. 15.\n\nIf that happens, the Vikings would still need an eventual Smith replacement, but it may not be in the 1st Round of the NFL draft. The team would basically buy itself another year.\n\nFinal note: safeties are usually pretty easy to find in free agency. If Minnesota doesn’t prefer the draft for a safety, about 10 startable options will be available on the open market in March. Players like Kamren Curl (Los Angeles Rams) and Jalen Thompson (Arizona Cardinals) will be available in six weeks if their current teams don’t renew their contracts.",

    "description": "The San Francisco 49ers went heavy on their top needs in a three-round 2026 NFL mock draft from the Draft Wire.",
    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers have a host of needs to address in the 2026 NFL draft as they continue piecing together an on-the-fly roster transition they hope helps them avoid a full-blown rebuild.\n\nA key piece of their success in that quest will be finding high-level talent via the draft. Free agency will cover some of their roster holes, but the draft is where long-term, sustainable success is found. That's why their trio of selections in a three-round projection from our friends at the Draft Wire make a ton of sense, even if they don't tackle some of the team's most immediate needs.\n\nHere's a quick look at their three picks:\n\nThe skinny: Concepcion hauled in 16 touchdowns across two seasons at North Carolina State, including a whopping 10 as a freshman. His numbers dipped some in his second season before transferring to Texas A&M where he found immediate success in the SEC. Last year he hauled in 61 receptions for 919 yards and nine touchdowns. Perhaps the most intriguing part of Concepcion's game is what he can do with the ball in his hands. He racked up 431 yards and three touchdowns on 70 carries in his college career. Concepcion also added punt return duties last season where he tallied a pair of touchdowns on 25 returns.\n\nThe skinny: McNeil-Warren would be a really interesting addition for an evolving 49ers defense. His size is evident on film and his production across four years at Toledo is strong. In 48 games he racked up 214 tackles with 11 tackles for loss, five interceptions, 17 pass breakups and nine forced fumbles. His length and athleticism would give San Francisco a new style of safety who can conceivably be a more dynamic option in the back end of their defense than either of the Ji'Ayir Brown-Malik Mustapha duo provides.\n\nThe skinny: There's a lot to like just looking at Josephs. His frame is leaner than his 6-3, 240-pound listing would suggest and he brings really good length that he uses to move blockers. His athleticism looks okay on tape, but he looks a little stiff coming off the edge which may be part of the reason he's a third-round projection this early in the draft process. Josephs spent four years at Tennessee and posted 104 tackles, 22 tackles for loss and 9.5 sacks. Josephs also notched four pass breakups and six forced fumbles. More depth on the edge should be a priority in this draft for the 49ers and Josephs has a lot of desirable tools.\n\nMore 49ers: Should the 49ers re-sign DL Yetur Gross-Matos in free agency?\n\nThis article originally appeared on Niners Wire: 2026 NFL draft: 49ers pick KC Concepcion, 2 others in 3-round mock",

    "fullText": "As the 2026 season approaches, several NFL teams remain in search of the right leader to guide their next chapter. These openings reflect franchises at different crossroads, whether rebuilding, retooling, or trying to push a talented roster over the top. The decisions made in the coming weeks will shape not only next season, but the long-term direction of each organization.\n\nArizona’s opening represents a chance to fully reset the organization’s direction. The roster has young talent but lacks consistency and identity, making this a pivotal hire. The Cardinals must decide whether to prioritize offensive innovation or cultural rebuilding. Their next coach will likely be tasked with long-term development rather than immediate contention.\n\nThe Bills’ vacancy is one of the most attractive jobs on the market due to a strong core and established expectations. However, the pressure to win immediately will narrow the candidate pool. Buffalo needs a leader who can manage high expectations while refining late-game execution. The next coach will be judged quickly by postseason results.\n\nCleveland’s search reflects ongoing instability at the top despite roster talent. The Browns need a coach who can unify the locker room and bring clarity to both sides of the ball. Consistency and leadership will matter as much as schematic prowess. This hire could define the franchise’s direction for years.\n\nThe Raiders continue searching for a coach who can stabilize a franchise defined by constant change. Las Vegas needs a strong cultural leader capable of commanding respect in a demanding market. Identity, discipline, and accountability are key priorities. The next hire must balance star power with structure.\n\nFor teams still searching, patience and clarity will be just as important as splash or star power. The right hire can stabilize a franchise and establish an identity, while the wrong one can set progress back years. How these teams finish the coaching carousel may ultimately define the balance of the league heading into 2026.\n\nThe post NFL: Teams still looking for new head coaches appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "It doesn't seem possible, but it was actually 34 years ago on Monday.\n\nThat's right, I remember it so well. It was January 26, 1992, in Super Bowl XXVI, and Washington jumped out to a 17-0 halftime lead over the Buffalo Bills. On the Bills' first second-half possession, linebacker Kurt Gouveia intercepted a Jim Kelly pass, nearly returning it for a touchdown. Gerald Riggs hammered the ball into the end zone, and it was 24-0 Redskins.\n\nREDEMPTION!\nJanuary 26, 1992\n\nFour years after \"The Fumble\" in the AFC Championship with the #Browns in Denver, running back Earnest Byner scores the first touchdown of Super Bowl XXVI en route to the Redskins' third Super Bowl title.#HTTR #RaiseHail pic.twitter.com/FWP0mbSpwV\n\n— Kevin Gallagher (@KevG163) January 26, 2026\n\nEarly in the final quarter, Mark Rypien, Earnest Byner, the Hogs, and the Posse (Art Monk, Gary Clark, Ricky Sanders), Charles Mann, Wilber Marshall, Darrell Green, and the rest of the Redskins were destroying the AFC Champion Bills 37-10. The game's final several minutes were anticlimactic, much less intense, with cameras showing Redskins on the sidelines laughing and enjoying themselves on their way to another Super Bowl championship, as the Bills scored two late scores for a 37-24 final.\n\nIt was Joe Jackson Gibbs' fourth Super Bowl with Washington and the third he had won. He had amazingly won those three Super Bowls with three different starting quarterbacks who were not Hall of Fame quarterbacks (Joe Theismann, Doug Williams, Mark Rypien). He also won with three different starting running backs (John Riggins, Timmy Smith, Earnest Byner). OT Joe Jacoby, C Jeff Bostic, WR Art Monk, TE Don Warren, G Russ Grimm and LB Monte Coleman played on all four of those Gibbs teams.\n\nSince that time Washington head coaches have been Richie Petitbon, Norv Turner, Terry Robiskie, Marty Schottenheimer, Steve Spurrier, Joe Gibbs again (2004-2007), Jim Zorn, Mike Shanahan, Jay Gruden, Bill Callahan, Ron Rivera, and Dan Quinn.\n\nYes, a lot has changed for Washington in the last 34 years, sadly, even the name.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: 34 years ago was franchise's last Super Bowl",

    "fullText": "It’s probably been a while since you’ve heard the name Bob Quinn, but the former Detroit Lions general manager is back in the news.\n\nAfter the Lions parted ways with Quinn in the middle of the 2020 season, he eventually joined the Cleveland Browns as a senior consultant. The next year, he was promoted to senior personnel/coaching executive, allowing him to work on both the coaching and team personnel side of the business.\n\nBut with the Browns’ latest regime dissolved in the midst of a new head coaching search, Quinn is leaving the organization and following former Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski to the Atlanta Falcons. His new role appears to be solely on the coaching side, as his title is senior advisor to the head coach.\n\nIt’s an interesting career arc for Quinn, who had worked solely on the personnel side of the business when he joined the Lions in 2016. He rose up the ranks in the New England Patriots’ scouting department for 15 years before landing the general manager job with the Lions. His time in Detroit was very mixed. On one hand, he made some impressive picks along the offensive line (Taylor Decker, Graham Glasgow, Frank Ragnow). On the other hand, he’ll always be haunted by the picks of Jarrad Davis, Teez Tabor, Jahlani Tavai, and Jeff Okudah. What ultimately sank his career the most was the decision to hire Matt Patricia as the team’s head coach—a disaster that set the franchise back several years.\n\nBut it speaks volumes that Stefanski—a two-time AP NFL Coach of the Year—trusts Quinn as his right-hand man on the coaching side of football. It appears Quinn has done a good job building out a new career within the NFL world.",

    "fullText": "Colorado football coach Deion Sanders has laid out an NFL-style system of fines for his players if they violate team rules, including $500 for being late to practice.\n\nHe showed it on the video screen in his first team meeting of 2026 on Jan. 23, as briefly seen in a video posted by his oldest son, Deion Jr. Here is what it said:\n\nLate to meeting or film session: $400\n\nNo-show to meeting or film session: $2,000\n\nLate to strength and conditioning workout: $1,000\n\nNo-show to strength and conditioning workout: $1,500\n\nViolation of team rules: $1,000-$2,500 based on severity.\n\nPublic or social media misconduct: $2,000-$5,000\n\nDamage to university or team property: repair cost +$3,000\n\nLoss of team technology or equipment: replacement cost +$1,000\n\nPlayers also are required to wear Nike shoes and apparel while representing the university at practices, games and organized team activities. Colorado has been a Nike-sponsored school since 1995. Sanders also is sponsored by Nike. Failure to comply also could result in disciplinary action.\n\nThere is an appeal process for players, with final decisions issued within five business days. But it's another example of the professionalization of college sports, with players this year getting paid directly by schools for use of their name, image and likeness (NIL).\n\nA lack of discipline also apparently was an issue for Colorado last year, when the Buffaloes finished 3-9 during Sanders’ third season in charge.\n\n“All these lates and tardies and all these things, we can’t have that this year,” Colorado receivers coach Jason Phillips told the team. “Those are the things we will eliminate… Two ways to eliminate that. Either you change, or we change you.”\n\nSanders has brought in 42 new scholarship transfer players this year, offsetting more than 35 scholarship players who transferred out.\n\n“You all are hand-picked, hand-picked, hand-picked,” Sanders told the team. “We watched darn near every one of y’all.”\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

    "description": "With the NFL Playoffs in the books and the Super Bowl on the horizon, Scott Pianowski takes a look at a quintet of players who have boosted their stock.",
    "fullText": "The fantasy football season effectively ended a month ago, but it’s important to scout the NFL playoff games as potential clues for 2026 value. Today, let’s discuss some players who have improved their stock since it got cold, be it with late-December rallies or impressive showings in the postseason.\n\nGive Mike Vrabel credit for not mothballing Stevenson after some early-season fumbling issues. The Patriots hitched up to Stevenson in the playoffs, giving him 45 touches the last two weeks, including 25 in the AFC Championship win over the Broncos. He currently has 194 rushing yards for the playoffs, tops in the NFL.\n\nMeanwhile, TreVeyon Henderson saw just three opportunities (three forgettable runs) in the victory at Denver. Henderson was the home-run hitter in this backfield most of the year, with Stevenson the steady grinder; come playoff time, the Pats have leaned into the grinder. And Stevenson was trusted much \n\nFigure on Stevenson getting a bell cow workload in the Super Bowl, and earning the higher ADP in next summer’s draft season.\n\nEveryone remembers his “hello world” moment, the 6-118-2 detonation at Cincinnati, including the game-winning touchdown. But the Bears didn’t completely hand Loveland the keys to the kingdom until after Christmas. He absorbed 48 targets over his final four games (including the playoffs), good for a 28-378-2 log.\n\nThis is going to push Loveland into pricy areas for next year’s fantasy drafts, but I’m here for it. Caleb Williams is also on the escalator and Ben Johnson is the right man with the play sheet.\n\nSean McVay usually employs a very narrow offense for fantasy purposes, relying on just a handful of skill players. But that tree expanded during the 2025 season, with Corum starting to become a proactive complement to starting RB Kyren Williams. Corum was the team’s most effective back in Sunday’s loss at Seattle (12 touches, 79 scrimmage yards), and he received double-digit touches in six of his final eight games. Corum also had six touchdowns on the year, with five of them coming after Thanksgiving.\n\nThe Rams haven’t soured on Williams and he’ll be the clear starter entering 2026. But Corum probably has 8-12 touch equity in any game where he’s healthy, and he’ll shoot past that projection every now and then, if the Rams want to steer into a hot hand. Corum is on the flex radar for 2026 fantasy planning, and he’s just one injury away from being a needle mover, too.\n\nI don’t know how to quit this guy. Mims was an afterthought for most of the year but he was forced into action during the playoffs, coming through with a nifty 12-155-1 line on 14 targets. I get it, the Broncos have a crowded receiver room, and Troy Franklin and Pat Bryant are still ascending talents. But let’s not forget that Mims will only be 24 next year, too. Mims has already scored 11 regular-season touchdowns despite limited opportunities, and he’s dynamic as a kick returner. He’s screaming for a bigger role.\n\nJust making the NFL as an undrafted receiver out of Holy Cross is a big win for Coker, but he’s not content to stop there. He stepped forward in his final six starts, posting a 28-378-4 log, including that 134-yard explosion against the Rams. Coker has good size and the ability to high point the ball, which gives him the potential to score 8-10 touchdowns in a full season, even with Tetairoa McMillan already on the team. Coker will be a trendy fantasy sleeper next summer, but I’ll still try to get a seat near the front of that bandwagon.",

To commemorate the milestone, Green Day will deliver a special opening performance before the teams take center stage, ushering generations of Super Bowl MVPs onto the field.\n\n“Celebrating 60 years of Super Bowl history with Green Day as a hometown band, while honoring the NFL legends who’ve helped define this sport, is an incredibly powerful way to kick off Super Bowl LX,” Tim Tubito, the league’s senior director of event and game presentation, told the Associated Press in January 2026.\n\nThough fans are amped for the 2026 Super Bowl's musical stars — which also include Charlie Puth and Bad Bunny — the main act will be on the field.\n\nPatriots quarterback Drake Maye will lead the team back to the Super Bowl for the first time since 2019, giving the franchise a chance at its seventh title and its first without Tom Brady and Bill Belichick. On the other side, Seattle returns to the Super Bowl with Sam Darnold at the helm, looking to secure its second Lombardi Trophy after winning its first in 2014.\n\nHere's everything to know about the 2026 Super Bowl, including the full performance lineup.\n\nSuper Bowl LX is scheduled for Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026.\n\nThis year's NFL championship game will be held at Levi's Stadium, home to the San Francisco 49ers, in Santa Clara, Calif.\n\nWhile the Patriots' last Super Bowl appearance was a win in 2019, the Seahawks' last championship game was in 2015 — when they lost 28-24 against the Patriots. The Seahawks have previously made three total appearances in the Super Bowl — 2006, 2014 and 2015 — and won once, in 2014.\n\nMeanwhile, the Patriots have made 11 appearances in the Super Bowl — more than any other team — and won six games. If they win in February, they will have the most ever wins in Super Bowl history.\n\nWhile all six wins have previously taken place during Brady and Belichick's era, Maye emphasized the team’s fresh chapter after the Patriots beat the Denver Broncos 10-7 at the AFC Championship game on Jan. 25.\n\n“It’s a new team, it’s a new era,” he told Boston.com. “I respect and appreciate what the Patriots dynasty did, and unfortunately they didn’t come out with some wins here, but we changed that narrative and look forward to bringing our best football for [the Super Bowl].”\n\nIn September 2025, the NFL announced that Bad Bunny (born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio) would perform at the 2026 Super Bowl Halftime Show. The \"MONACO\" rapper shared his excitement about the honor in a statement at the time.\n\n“What I'm feeling goes beyond myself,\" he explained. \"It's for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown… this is for my people, my culture, and our history. Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL.”\n\nFans will also be treated to a lineup of killer performances before the game even starts. Green Day will kick off the events with an opening ceremony to \"welcome the MVPs who’ve shaped the game and open the night for fans all over the world,\" frontman Billie Joe Armstrong said in a statement.\n\nAfter that, Puth will sing the national anthem, followed by 11-time Grammy winner Brandi Carlile performing \"America the Beautiful.\" Coco Jones will also give a rendition of \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" to close out the pregame ceremony.\n\nAccording to the NFL, the 2026 Super Bowl kicks off at 6:30 p.m. ET / 3:30 p.m. PT. Green Day's opening ceremony performance will start airing a half-hour earlier at 6 p.m. ET / 3 p.m. PT.\n\nThose who aren't catching the game live in California can watch it broadcast on NBC and Telemundo, per the NFL.

    "fullText": "Why NFL fans believe 'script writers' predicted Super Bowl 60 matchup with preseason graphic originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFor a few years, there existed a conspiracy theory that the colors of the Super Bowl logo predicted which two teams would play for the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nWell, that one is out, and a new theory is in.\n\nSome NFL fans believe a preseason graphic the league posted to its social media accounts actually predicted the seemingly unpredictable Super Bowl 60 matchup between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks, two teams that hadn't won a playoff game since 2019 before this season.\n\nHere's a look at the graphic behind the NFL's newest \"script writer\" conspiracy theory.\n\nMORE:Super Bowl 60 odds, spread as Seahawks open as favorites\n\nAfter the Patriots and Seahawks punched their ticket to the Super Bowl, fans started to notice which two quarterbacks seem to be closer to the giant Lombardi Trophy than the rest in this graphic posted by the NFL on the first day of the regular season:\n\n— RedditCFB (@RedditCFB) January 26, 2026\n\nA closer inspection reveals you can make the case Baker Mayfield was actually closer than Darnold, or that Travis Hunter seems to be the closest to the trophy.\n\nThis is no time for facts, though. NFL fans have unearthed the latest grand Super Bowl conspiracy, and it's true that Maye and Darnold were both front and center in relation to the Lombardi Trophy in the graphic just as they are in reality today.\n\n\"They really gave us the script in September,\" the lead Drake Maye fan account tweeted Sunday night.\n\nThey really gave us the script in September https://t.co/ofeVgBdbPb\n\n— Drake Maye Lover (@drakemayeloverr) January 26, 2026\n\nAnother look at the graphic reveals the NFL probably believed a Patriots-Seahawks Super Bowl was enormously unlikely. The sport's biggest names are front-and-center, from Saquon Barkley and Patrick Mahomes to Brock Purdy and Joe Burrow. Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen are also closer to Mahomes and Barkley than they are to Maye and Darnold in the distance.\n\nConsidering players from the Jacksonville Jaguars, New York Giants and Tennessee Titans are standing nearly shoulder-to-shoulder with Maye and Darnold in the distance, it seems more like the league discounted the Patriots and Seahawks than predicted their Super Bowl 60 meeting.\n\nWhy let the finer details get in the way of a good conspiracy theory, though?\n\nSeahawks take down Rams to advance to Super Bowl 60\n\nSam Darnold, Jaxon Smith-Njigba star for Seahawks in NFC championship\n\nRams' special teams blunders continue in NFC championship\n\nSeahawks Pope trend continues with Super Bowl 60 berth",

The Seahawks will have to overcome that painful history along with Sam Darnold’s embarrassing 0-4 career record against the Patriots.\n\nDarnold will need to step up against New England’s historically good defense, which is averaging just 8.7 points per game allowed in these playoffs.

    "description": "Once the No. 3 overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, Sam Darnold’s career seemed destined to be remembered as a cautionary tale.",
    "fullText": "Once the No. 3 overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, Sam Darnold’s career seemed destined to be remembered as a cautionary tale. He was labeled a bust with the New York Jets, flamed out in Carolina, faded into the background in San Francisco, and was ultimately discarded by the Minnesota Vikings. Eight seasons later, that narrative is officially dead.\n\nOn Sunday night, Darnold delivered the defining performance of his career, throwing for 346 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Seattle Seahawks to a 31–27 win over the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship Game. The victory sends Seattle to Super Bowl LX. And sends Darnold’s critics scrambling.\n\n“I mean, he just shut a lot of people up tonight,” Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald said after the game. “So I’m really happy for him.”\n\nDarnold was sensational from start to finish, matching throws with MVP candidate Matthew Stafford on the game’s biggest stage. He connected with Jaxon Smith-Njigba for a momentum-swinging touchdown with 20 seconds left in the first half, flipping the game in Seattle’s favor.\n\nFollowing a disastrous Rams special teams mistake, Darnold capitalized by firing a strike to Jake Bobo over the middle for another score. Later, he ripped a perfectly placed spiral through Los Angeles’ zone coverage to Cooper Kupp for a 13-yard touchdown, the play that ultimately proved decisive.\n\nThe performance was a masterclass in poise and precision. Darnold finished 25-of-36 passing with zero interceptions, repeatedly delivering when the moment demanded it most.\n\nSeattle complemented Darnold’s brilliance with timely defense and game-changing special teams. Devon Witherspoon made back-to-back pass breakups inside the six-yard line late in the fourth quarter, forcing a turnover on downs that kept the Rams off the scoreboard.\n\nOn special teams, the Seahawks forced two muffed punts from Rams returner Xavier Smith, recovering the second to set up Darnold’s touchdown pass to Bobo.\n\n“It’s a team win,” Macdonald said. “And then, you can’t talk about the game without talking about our quarterback.”\n\nFor Darnold, this marks his first NFC Championship win as a starter. He previously earned a conference title as a backup with the 49ers during their Super Bowl run two years ago, but this one was different — this one was his.\n\nAfter five teams, nearly 3,000 pass attempts, and almost eight full seasons in the league, Darnold has become the first quarterback from the vaunted 2018 draft class, which included Baker Mayfield and MVPs Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson, to win a conference championship as a starter.\n\nWhen his best was required, Sam Darnold delivered it. Two weeks from now in Santa Clara, he’ll have a chance to put the final stamp on a career resurrection that once seemed impossible.\n\nThe post Seahawks News: Mike Macdonald Says Sam Darnold “Shut a Lot of People Up” With 3-TD Game vs. Rams appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "As the NFL makes more and more officiating misses subject to replay review, the lingering blind spots become more and more glaring.\n\nIt's time (in fact, it's long overdue) for missed facemask fouls to be called via replay.\n\nThere's no reason not to do it. Replay currently can be used to undo an erroneous facemask call. Why shouldn't it be used when a clear and obvious foul was missed?\n\nIt happened during the second quarter of Sunday's NFC Championship, when Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford had his facemask grabbed on a third-down sack that forced a field goal. If the penalty hadn't been missed, the Rams would have gotten 15 yards and a fresh set of downs.\n\nSome would say the NFL resists using replay to put a flag on the field. From its inception, however, the current replay rules have allowed a penalty to be called for having too many men on the field.\n\nToday, too many things are reviewable to justify omitting something that requires no subjectivity. And it's eventually going to affect a huge game, in a huge spot.\n\nIt affected today's huge NFC Championship, ending a potential touchdown drive that could have tied the game at 10 and forcing the Rams to settle for three. And it's a flaw that can easily be fixed.",

The Buffalo Bills lost that one to the Kansas City Chiefs after failing to get a possession in overtime, as you might recall.\n\nA playoff game also cannot end in a tie, so if the score is even after the first overtime period, the teams will play as many are needed for a winner to emerge. Between each overtime period a two-minute intermission will take place. Additionally, the second and fourth overtime periods are subject to the same timing rules as the second and fourth regulation periods.\n\nLike the regular season, overtime will not feature any instant replay coach's challenges as all reviews are initiated by the replay official.\n\nNo playoff games went to overtime last season, so perhaps we're due for some this year.

    "fullText": "It’s a scary thought for the NFL that Drake Maye hasn’t necessarily reached his full potential.\n\nMaye can conclude his second season with a Super Bowl appearance if the New England Patriots defeat the Denver Broncos on Sunday. The 23-year-old quarterback is also an MVP finalist after completing 72 percent of his passes for 4,394 yards and 31 touchdowns.\n\nCapturing a Lombardi Trophy could help establish Maye as one of the league’s premier signal-callers. When asked how good he could become during CBS’s pre-game coverage of the AFC Championship Game, former Pro Bowl offensive lineman Kyle Long declared that the sky is the limit.\n\n“There is no ceiling,” Long said. “From a physical standpoint, from a personality standpoint, from a toughness standpoint, he checks all the boxes.”\n\nMaye endured an uneven rookie campaign for the 4-13 Patriots, but they’ve reversed that record behind an improved roster. Long celebrated Maye’s maturation alongside a bolstered supporting cast and praised the North Carolina native’s humility.\n\n“He’s proved it all season long,” Long added. “He’s unbelievably accurate, but I think the thing that stands out the most … his personality. He’s got an ‘Aw shucks’ about him.”\n\nMaye has been far from perfect this postseason, losing three of six fumbles and throwing an interception in each game. However, he also averaged 9.2 yards per pass attempt in a 16-3 win over the Los Angeles Chargers and tossed three touchdowns against the Houston Texans’ No. 1-ranked defense in the AFC Divisional Round.\n\nSurviving another stout Broncos defense could help Maye quickly stamp his place in Patriots lore and continue his ascension to superstardom.\n\nHow Patriots Would Make NFL History With AFC Championship Game Win Vs.

    "description": "Those familiar with the pair have told Yahoo Sports in recent months that the rekindled admiration is real. But burying the hatchet in the NFL guarantees nothing.",
    "fullText": "Heading into Week 18, Aaron Rodgers was nothing if not pragmatically optimistic.\n\nThe days on his Pittsburgh Steelers contract were dwindling. The future of head coach Mike Tomlin was a subject of public debate. And the franchise he quarterbacked was cornered into a de facto playoff game against the Baltimore Ravens in the regular-season finale. Any direction you looked, there was something finite hanging in the balance. But in what registered in at least a mild surprise, Rodgers spoke to reporters like a man who didn’t see a definitive near-term conclusion to his football career … so long as he didn’t want it to end.\n\n“I’m thinking about this week, but obviously I’m 42 years old and I’m on a one-year deal, so you know what the situation is,” Rodgers told reporters. “Whenever the season ends, I’ll be a free agent. So that’ll give me a lot of options if I still want to play.”\n\nRodgers gave a slight shrug and chuckled.\n\n“Not a lot of options, but — there will be options I would think. Maybe one or two if I decide I still want to play.”\n\n[Get more Steelers news: Pittsburgh team feed]\n\nHe then punctuated the thought by opening the door to a return.\n\n“I’ve enjoyed this experience,” Rodgers said. “Everybody in Pittsburgh has been fantastic to me on and off the field. It’s really what I was hoping for, for this experience. It’s been even better than I was hoping.”\n\nA few days later, the Steelers would beat the Ravens and make the postseason, before getting bounced in the first round of the playoffs against the Houston Texans. All in all, it culminated in a season that felt like Rodgers, Tomlin and the Steelers squeezed about as much as they could have expected.\n\nThen Tomlin left, via a resignation that felt like a surprise to ownership. And maybe to Rodgers, too, given that any thought of his return seemed so strongly bound to whether Tomlin would continue to guide Pittsburgh. When that changed, logical speculation — and that’s all we’ve been left with thus far on the Rodgers front — was that a new head coach would mean a new quarterback. Whatever options were on the table for Rodgers, they appeared to have shrunk by one.\n\nThen came Saturday, when the Steelers went against their historical hiring template and locked in 62-year-old Mike McCarthy, a candidate who can fit more than one forward-looking ideology.  On one hand, McCarthy is a seasoned veteran coach who can come in and try to energize an aging roster that is still very much built to win now. On the other, he could be tasked with developing the franchise’s next young quarterback. Without a bridge starter currently on the roster, it will be difficult for McCarthy to achieve both of those responsibilities.\n\nUnless, of course, McCarthy can find a veteran who knows his system and can come in and help with both tasks. Maybe a quarterback who McCarthy previously helped develop into a star? One who already has spent a season in the Pittsburgh quarterback room with 24-year-old Will Howard, who showed promise in limited reps during his rookie preseason and has the support of the front office as a prospect worth some continued development?\n\nThat sounds like a fit for Rodgers. And perhaps the renewal of a 2026 option that appeared to be extinguished when Tomlin resigned.\n\nOf course, that doesn’t mean McCarthy was hired with any kind of specificity of luring Rodgers back for another season. While some of Pittsburgh’s players gave Rodgers high marks as a teammate in their exit interviews, the work to find the next long-term starting option is clearly near the top of the priorities for ownership and general manager Omar Khan. And that wouldn’t have changed even if Tomlin had remained. One way or another, 2026 was always going to be geared toward either figuring out if the next young quarterback is already on the roster (in the form of Howard) or if the Steelers liked any of their draft, trade or free-agency options.\n\nMcCarthy’s arrival won’t change that mindset. The real factors of change at the quarterback spot will instead be pressed against the options Pittsburgh has available. If McCarthy is a head coach Rodgers will play for, it gives Pittsburgh at least one more year of a bridge starter to either weigh Howard as a prospect, or find someone in the 2026 draft who is worthy of being selected and then groomed. And there’s certainly some deep-value intrigue over the coming draft class of quarterbacks.\n\nThe Steelers won’t have a shot at Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza and their first-round draft pick at No. 21 overall might not be high enough to land Alabama’s Ty Simpson, either. But after that tandem, there are some interesting quarterbacks who could be seen as worthwhile projects with upside. Mississippi’s Trinidad Chambliss (if he can’t force another year of NCAA eligibility) will draw a significant amount of study from NFL teams. As will a quartet of others who were previously considered to be first-round picks — and potentially very high first-round picks — until hitting stumbles in their final seasons: LSU’s Garrett Nussmeier, Miami’s Carson Beck, Penn State’s Drew Allar and Clemson’s Cade Klubnik, among others.\n\nFor now — and we’ve yet to go through the draft sifting process, so take this with a grain of salt — only Mendoza cuts the figure as a Day 1 rookie starter. Simpson could round into that kind of prospect, or one who has a shot to earn a starting job during his rookie season. The rest? Most personnel opinions appear to be placing them on a developmental track to possibly get a shot with a year or more of work from further down the depth chart.\n\nIf any of those players are in the Steelers’ future, McCarthy’s hiring makes a lot of sense given his history with helping quarterbacks grow into starters. And it also makes sense that Rodgers would be a fit, so long as he continues to be in a year-to-year contract mindset and actually wants to play for McCarthy again.\n\nIn that latter vein, both McCarthy and Rodgers have said very nice things about each other in the least few years, each gaining the perspective of working with new people and in new places. Those familiar with the pair have told Yahoo Sports in recent months that the rekindled admiration is real, with both having come to terms with their own mistakes and frustrations that ultimately played a part in McCarthy getting fired late in the 2018 season after coaching the Green Bay Packers for nearly 13 years.\n\nBut burying the hatchet in the NFL guarantees nothing. Even if Rodgers wants to play again and McCarthy would like to have him in 2026, the veteran quarterback doesn’t know what the rest of the league landscape will look like in even a few weeks. There’s a chance the Los Angeles Rams win a Super Bowl and Matthew Stafford decides to pull a John Elway and retire. Should that happen, the Rams will still be very much in the middle of a Super Bowl window and not have an obvious starting quarterback on the roster. And then there is the Minnesota Vikings, a team Rodgers was very interested in playing for last offseason. They are looking for someone to come in and compete with J.J. McCarthy for the starting job next season.\n\nAdd the Steelers to that mix, and you have exactly what Rodgers was talking about when he focused his gaze on 2026. Not a lot of options — but certainly some interesting ones.",

    "description": "Sam Darnold can make USC history. Other Trojans will play huge roles as they all try to make the Super Bowl",
    "fullText": "We are one week closer to the conclusion of the NFL playoffs. This weekend will determine which two teams will make it to the Super Bowl. In both games, the former USC Trojans will play a huge factor and have their fingerprints all over games with the Super Bowl up for grabs. Sam Darnold not only has his legacy on the line, but also a chance to represent his alma mater for the first time on the NFL's biggest stage.\n\nHere are my predictions for championship weekend in the NFL:\n\nSam Darnold and the Seahawks will enter the biggest game in recent memory for the former NFC juggernaut. This time around, they enter with a defense similar to the Legion of Boom but an offense that is more well-rounded. Seattle has looked miles ahead of the other playoff teams left. I think the Rams will give them a challenge and this game will come down to the last drive, but Seattle has proven themselves to be the better team between the two teams in this matchup. They can blowout teams, they can win close, low-score games, and they can win shootouts. I think this game, Sam Darnold, and the Seahawks offense will have to be at its best, but I think Darnold will deliver the best quarterback performance in this matchup. Seattle will move on and represent the NFC in the Super Bowl.\n\nMany might gift wrap this win to the Patriots with Bo Nix being out for the rest of the season, but I disagree. I think the Patriots come out on top, but they will have to work for this game. The Broncos' defense will need former USC Trojan Talanoa Hufanga to fly around and make plays all day. The Patriots' offense has struggled to keep Drake Maye upright in each of their playoff games. Maye has been sacked 5 times. That is where the Broncos' defense specializes. Their defensive line can get after their quarterback like no other. The Broncos' defense will keep them in this game; it will come down to whether or not he can put together his best Nick Foles impression. I think he will play well, but not well enough to win this football game. I think he will come up short late and throw a costly interception, and Drake Maye and Mike Vrabel will iron out this victory in a low-scoring defensive battle.\n\nI think Sam Darnold saves his biggest performance for the game right before the Super Bowl. Darnold squeaked by Stafford and the Rams in the last meeting between the two teams in an overtime win. Darnold will have to play exactly like he did down the stretch in that game to get the victory in this one. I think Darnold reaches 300 yards through the air, and he and Jaxon Smith-Njigba light up the Rams' secondary. This secondary has given up their fair share of big games to their opponent. This game will be no different. Jaxon Smith-Njigba will have over 100 yards receiving, and he will connect with Sam Darnold for two touchdowns in this game. I think Darnold and Jaxon Smith-Njigba have the two biggest performances in the NFC Championship game.\n\nIn the AFC, I think pass rusher Nik Bonitto has the most dominant performance. The Patriots have given up 5 sacks in each of their playoff games. In the last game versus the Texans, Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson Jr. combined for 5 sacks. Bonitto this season had 14 sacks. I think he will have 3 sacks in this game and disrupt Drake Maye all game long.\n\nI think defensive tackle Milton Williams will also have himself a big game and disrupt the Broncos on the other end. Williams has been a huge reason for the Patriots' defensive turnaround, and he was great all regular season long. He creates pressure from the interior with the best of them, and he is a great run stopper. I think he will lead this Patriots defensive line to make the Broncos one-dimensional and take out their run game. Williams will also lead the Patriots in sacks with two. Verus the Chargers, Williams had two sacks, and against the Texans, he was an irritant all game long, forcing the pick 6 that took the momentum away from Houston initially. I think Milton Williams will use all of that to have his best playoff game with the Patriots and help send his team to the Super Bowl.\n\nMy Super Bowl matchup prediction is the New England Patriots taking on the Seattle Seahawks. The Patriots have had quite the Super Bowl run vs tough defenses, but they still will not be prepared for the Seahawks' defense. Mike Macdonald and the Seahawks defense will make it a tough day for young star quarterback Drake Maye. I think his age and inexperience will come back to bite him in this match. I think Rashid Shaheed will pay homage to Devin Hester and take the opening kickoff back for a touchdown, setting the tone for the entire game. I think Darnold will not have to do much to be the top quarterback on the field, but he still will put up a respectable performance. Seattle will play their last complete performance of the season, getting their Super Bowl victory. Darnold will look to be greedy and not just settle for being the first Trojan quarterback to start in the Super Bowl, but he will also become the first Trojan quarterback to win a Super Bowl.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: Predictions for USC on championship weekend in NFL playoffs",

    "fullText": "Jarrett Stidham chose to remain with the Denver Broncos last offseason.\n\nWith his initial two-year deal set to expire last March, Stidham drew interest from other NFL teams — including the New England Patriots — but he opted to re-sign with the Broncos on another two-year contract.\n\nTen months later, Stidham is set to start for Denver against New England in the AFC Championship game on Sunday following Bo Nix's season-ending ankle injury. After practice on Wednesday, Stidham was asked about his decision to re-sign with the Broncos in 2025.\n\n“There are always opportunities out there and stuff, but I think at the end of the day, there was a combination of things that went into my decision to come back here,\" Stidham said. \"I believe in Sean [Payton], and Davis [Webb] and Joe [Lombardi], and our room, and being behind Bo and helping him grow. I take a lot of pride in that.\n\n\"I felt like, over the last two years that I was here, that I got a lot better. I think the way Davis has coached us over these last three years now has really helped all of us improve. That’s just one thing I wanted to come back and be a part of. I felt like being here the last two years, and coming in with Sean, and signing and everything, it’s pretty evident that he has the train rolling in the right direction. I don’t think anybody can argue that, and I wanted to be a part of it.”\n\nStidham was one of Payton's first free agent signings when the coach arrived in 2023, and Payton has made it clear that he has faith in Stidham. After three years in a backup role, Stidham now gets an opportunity to step up and make history. Sunday's game (1:00 p.m. MT) will be nationally televised on CBS (more TV info).\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL: Jarrett Stidham explains why he re-signed with Broncos in 2025",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe 2026 Pro Bowl is nearly upon us. Before Super Bowl 60 kicks off, some of the best players from the AFC and NFC will play in a re-imagined Pro Bowl.\n\nSince 2023, the NFL's annual Pro Bowl has included flag football and a skill challenge, instead of a traditional game with pads. The move was focused on player safety and making the event more fun for players invited to the week's event.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the 2026 Pro Bowl, which will be broadcast live from the Moscone Center in San Francisco\n\nThe 2025 Pro Bowl will have a bit of different feel this year, as it will be spread out over different days than usual.\n\nInstead of having the events finish over the weekend, the Pro Bowl will end with the flag football game on Tuesday evening before the Super Bowl. The event will also be included in the lead-up to the Super Bowl in San Francisco, instead of its own standalone event.\n\nIn year's past, the game had been played on either a Saturday or Sunday. This year, the flag football game will take place on a Tuesday evening.\n\nFlag football game: Tuesday, Feb. 3 at 8 p.m. ET\n\nThe 2025 Pro Bowl will be broadcast on ESPN, ABC and Disney XD. You can also stream the game exclusively on the ESPN app, as well as Fubo, which offers a free trial.\n\nThose who want to stream the game can do so with Fubo or the ESPN app. Fubo carries both ESPN and ABC in its channel lineup, and is currently offering a free trial.\n\nThe complete Pro Bowl rosters for the NFC and AFC were announced in late December. The full rosters for both teams can be found here.\n\nThe flag football game is expected to take place Tuesday, Feb. 3.\n\n7-on-7 flag football:  One game of 7-on-7 flag football complete with four quarters.

    "title": "Fact Check: Don't fall for rumor Jalen Hurts established Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund",
    "description": "According to the rumor, the NFL's 2025 Super Bowl MVP donated $300,000 of his own money as a way of kick-starting the special fund.",
    "fullText": "Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts established the Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund — in honor of the woman fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis in January 2026 —and contributed $300,000.\n\nIn January 2026, online users shared a rumor claiming Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts established the Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund. Users' posts claimed the NFL's Super Bowl LIX MVP kickstarted the fund himself, contributing $300,000 of his own money.\n\nThe purported scholarship fund referenced Renee Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident shot fatally shot on Jan. 7 by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross.\n\nFor example, on Jan. 20, a user managing the NFL Pulse Facebook page posted (archived) an image collage of three pictures allegedly showing Hurts hugging Good's 6-year-old son on a football field, Good holding her son in front of a body of water and Hurts walking inside a football stadium. The post's text claimed Good's killing inspired Hurts to launch the Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund, including the $300,000 contribution.\n\nIn short, the rumor was false. One or more users fabricated and promoted the claim with the help of images and text generated with artificial-intelligence tools.\n\nSnopes contacted a manager of the NFL Pulse Facebook page to ask about the fictional stories and AI-generated content displayed on the feed, as well as the Philadelphia Eagles to request an official statement, and will update this story if we receive more information.\n\nThe NFL Pulse Facebook post (archived) — as well as other Facebook posts sharing the same rumor — featured links leading to advertisement-filled articles hosted on WordPress blogs. The users owning those blogs earned revenue based on the combination of advertising and made-up stories. The NFL Pulse post redirected to an article on on such untrustworthy website.\n\nSearches of Bing, DuckDuckGo and Google found no news media outlets reporting about Hurts establishing a scholarship fund in Good's name. A Yahoo search did, however, mistakenly produce an AI-generated answer wrongly confirming the rumor as true. Outlets would have widely reported on the story involving Hurts and Good, had it truly occurred.\n\nRegarding the fake, AI-generated photo of Hurts holding Good's son, the most evident sign of AI — aside from the misspelling of \"Eagles\" as \"Eaglees\" — was the reality that sports and standard news outlets would have very widely publicized the moment, had the meeting between the quarterback and young boy truly taken place.\n\nThe NFL Pulse Facebook post's text, presented in its entirety later in this article, featured over-dramatic wording common with AI tools. For example, one part of the post read, \"This was not charity for attention. It was an act of remembrance, of dignity, and of deep human empathy — a reminder that even in the aftermath of violence and loss, compassion can still speak louder than silence.\" Additionally, the idea that individuals or teams aiming to rapidly produce inauthentic content for ad revenue would carefully, slowly and manually write text for their articles simply does not square with reality.\n\nThe person or people who authored the story about Hurts and Good fabricated the entire claim as one of hundreds of inspirational tales that depicted celebrities and athletes performing inspiring acts of kindness. Such stories resemble glurge, which Dictionary.com defines as stories \"that are supposed to be true and uplifting, but which are often fabricated and sentimental.\"\n\nFor readers interested in the story told in the NFL Pulse Facebook post, the post presented the made-up tale as follows:\n\nJalen Hurts has officially established The Renee Good Hope Scholarship Fund, personally committing an initial $300,000 donation to honor the life of Renee Nicole Good — a mother whose story ended in tragedy after she was killed in Minneapolis, a loss that left an entire community grieving.\n\nBut this gesture goes far beyond a financial contribution.\n\nJalen Hurts founded the scholarship fund himself to ensure that Renee's 6-year-old son will receive full educational support from elementary school through college — including tuition, books, tutoring, and opportunities for personal development. Alongside the financial commitment, Jalen also dedicated his voice, his platform, and his heart to a child now facing a world without his mother.\n\nThis was not charity for attention. It was an act of remembrance, of dignity, and of deep human empathy — a reminder that even in the aftermath of violence and loss, compassion can still speak louder than silence.\n\nAcross the nation, many were moved not by the amount of money pledged, but by the meaning behind Jalen's decision: a promise that Renee Nicole Good's life mattered, and that her son's future will be protected, supported, and filled with hope.\n\nFor further reading, we previously reported about the time tech billionaire Elon Musk deleted a post supporting the Eagles supporting the Eagles after they lost the 2023 Super Bowl LVII.\n\n\"GLURGE Definition & Meaning.\" Dictionary.com, https://www.dictionary.com/browse/glurge.\n\nHuberman, Bond, and David Emery. \"Snopestionary: What Does 'Glurge' Mean?\" Snopes, 21 Aug. 2021, https://www.snopes.com//articles/363643/what-does-glurge-mean/.",

    "description": "Detroit Lions LB Jack Campbell is the recipient of the 2025 Pro Butkus Award.",
    "fullText": "Detroit Lions linebacker Jack Campbell has been named the recipient of the 2025 Pro Butkus Award. The award, which is more known for the identical college honors, goes to the top linebacker in the NFL, as voted on by Butkus Award Selection Committee—a selection of 51 voters from all ranks of football, including NFL front office members, scouts, and coaches.\n\n“Jack Campbell embodies everything the Butkus Award represents,” the committee said in a statement (via Hawkeyesports.com). “His size, instincts and disciplined approach to the position allow him to control the middle of the field. He plays with authority, communicates at a high level, and consistently puts himself in position to make impactful plays. His rise this season reflects not just talent, but leadership and football character.”\n\nCampbell’s 2025 season was a breakout for the third-year linebacker. He was named First-Team All Pro after tallying 176 tackles, nine tackles for loss, 5.0 sacks, three forced fumbles, and two fumble recoveries.\n\n“He’s extremely valuable,” Lions coach Dan Campbell said in December. “Right now, first of all he leads the team in amount of reps that he’s played for a season. He’s taken more reps than anybody on this team. He plays on kickoff for us and he’s an asset on kickoff and then everything you see on defense. He doesn’t come off the field, he’s our bell cow, green dot. And he does—and the guy is smart and he’s instinctive and he is snap-to-whistle all-out, all the time, in practice too. And he doesn’t take plays off, he doesn’t take days off, he goes after the football, he’s a ball guy. So, he’s invaluable.”\n\nInterestingly, this is the second time Campbell has won the award. Back in 2022, he won the college version of the award after a standout year with the Iowa Hawkeyes. That season, Campbell posted 128 tackles, 5.5 tackles for loss, a forced fumble, and a fumble recovery.\n\nCampbell is heading into the fourth and final year of his rookie contract, although the Lions have an opportunity to exercise a fifth-year option worth a projected $16.4 million. The deadline to exercise that option is May 1. But the Lions may very well sign Campbell to a contract extension before then.",

    "fullText": "With the victories come the spoils, or the losses. The losses don’t show up on the scoreboard, but in the pieces that are lost from the victor’s staff. Such is the potential for the Jacksonville Jaguars this offseason with their staff. Defensive coordinator Anthony Campanile recently had a second interview with the Arizona Cardinals, this time in person. But he is not the only Jacksonville coordinator attracting attention from other NFL teams. Jaguars offensive coordinator Grant Udinski has been identified as someone who could one day become a head coach. The Buffalo Bills, who recently fired their head coach, are seeking a new coach and have reached out to Udinski for an interview. The 30-year-old Udinski is considered a very bright offensive mind, and he could be really considered by Buffalo for their head coaching position. But life always has a way of showing us the mistakes we made.\n\nHiring coaches who have not called plays offensively has been shown to us before. In fact, the Tennessee Titans showed us this in 2024 when they hired Cincinnati Bengals offensive coordinator Brian Callahan. He had worked with a multitude of talented quarterbacks, including Peyton Manning and Joe Burrow in some aspects. And even though he was the offensive coordinator in Cincinnati, he did not call the plays. He did, however, put together the gameplans. While Callahan's involvement in the game plans and putting them together was paramount, it does not replace the feel that comes with calling plays. Knowing when and where to call different things in different situations is something that comes with experience in that position. While Callahan may have considered all scenarios when he was the offensive coordinator, that cannot replace the in-tune feeling for what situations call for at certain moments.\n\nWith Udinski, he is a coordinator who has not called plays in Jacksonville. He is surely a part of the braintrust regarding the Jacksonville offense that has helped make Trevor Lawrence an MVP Finalist this year. But when you move over a seat from the assistant to the head coach, things get a little different, as Brian Callahan can attest to. Combine that lack of play-calling experience with the pressure cooker that is the Buffalo Bills' job right now, and Udinski would be entering a situation that could put pressure on him he may not be ready to handle. And in that case, it could ultimately lead to him having a quicker exit than he would want there. Overall, while he is being considered for the job, he may not be the right man for the job at this time and may need more room to grow.\n\nCalling plays does not seem like a big deal to many on the outside looking in, but it is something prospective head coaches need to do the majority of the time. While Udinski is a candidate in Buffalo and is hailed as an ascending coach, the fact of the matter is that he may do best by gaining that play-calling experience before becoming a head coach for longevity’s sake.",

    "fullText": "With only a few weeks left of NFL games until August, it’s time to take a look ahead to the teams that underachieved this season but are set up to take big steps forward next season. These five teams are all more talented than their records this past season indicated, and here is why they will all bounce back and improve next season.\n\nThe Giants have some big names on their defensive front and also have one of the league’s most exciting young quarterbacks in Jaxson Dart. When you add a brand new Super Bowl-winning head coach to the mix in John Harbaugh, things immediately improve.\n\nThe Giants future success goes way beyond that, though. The return of Malik Nabers will have a massive impact on this offense, as will the return of running back Cam Skateboo. The Giants should also be able to improve in the draft and via free agency, setting them up for what should be a much better 2026/2027 season.\n\nIf not for Joe Burrow missing most of the season, the Bengals could have easily won the weak AFC North division. Burrow is arguably a top-three quarterback in the NFL, and when he did suit up this season, the Bengals offense was one of the best in the league.\n\nExpect them to make improvements to their defense through the draft and be a much more competitive team next season. One thing they will need to address as well is their offensive line, so that they can protect Joe Burrow better and keep him healthy.\n\nThe Falcons were exciting early on this season, and they played great football to end the season as well. They have a very exciting offense that is loaded with star players, and the return of Michael Penix Jr. should only improve their chances.\n\nThey hired Kevin Stefanski as their new head coach, who should be a great fit for them, and also give Stefanski a chance to prove what he can do with a talented offense, something he was never given in Cleveland. The Falcons defense was much improved last season and should only continue to improve heading into next season.\n\nThe Vikings got off to a horrible start this season and dug themselves such a deep hole that they couldn’t climb out of. Based on how well they finished the season, though, there is hope that they can get back to being a playoff team in the NFC next season.\n\nThey have a very talented defense, one of the best offensive minds at head coach, and one of the best wide receivers in the league as well. Keeping JJ McCarthy healthy will be very important, but the Vikings could also look to bring in a veteran quarterback to not only push McCarthy but also as insurance in the event that McCarthy gets hurt again or just doesn’t perform well enough.\n\nThe Ravens entered this season as one of the Super Bowl favorites and ended up being the most disappointing team in the league. Lamar Jackson couldn’t stay healthy, the defense struggled for most of the season, and the wide receiving corps underwhelmed.\n\nThey moved on from John Harbaugh this offseason and hired Jesse Minter, who was one of the hottest names on the market. Bringing in a great offensive coordinator to work with the multiple-time MVP award winner, Lamar Jackson, is the team’s next mission. Keeping Jackson healthy, adding another big WR weapon, and getting some fresh blood on the sidelines coaching should lead to a much more successful 2026/2027 season.\n\nCheck out all of our NFL articles: https://www.thebiglead.com/category/nfl/\n\nThe post 5 NFL teams who will take a big step forward next season  appeared first on The Big Lead.",

The Kingdom are the team to beat going into 2026, but there is plenty to play for this season across the divisions with promotion and relegation potentially season-defining. Former Donegal star Brendan Devenney runs his eye over what may lie ahead in year two of Gaelic football's new rules.\n\nI covered last year's league final between Kerry and Mayo which was a poor enough affair.\n\nYou could see nobody was that worried, but what Jack O'Connor does is win the league which is a precursor to the championship.\n\nThey had a couple of rocky games after that with Cork putting it up to them [in Munster] and Meath got to them [in the championship] so we didn't see them as the finished article until they got to the All-Ireland final when they were on another level and reaching those heights again will make them very hard to stop.\n\nIn terms of the game itself, I think a big focus this year will be on scoring and preventing the two-pointers, while winning around the middle on kick-outs will be crucial.\n\nIf teams put a full squeeze on from the kick-out, the majority will be long and if you have big, physical men around the middle, that will be a huge asset.\n\nDefensively, you just can't lie in and shut the game down now because you can be picked off with two-pointers or if you move out, you can be hit with a ball over the top.\n\nAfter a period to fully figure out their approach, this weekend will be interesting to see how teams have adapted.",

    "description": "Jason Williams inbox: Baltimore and Buffalo fired highly successful coaches. Does it make Bengals look worse for sticking with Zac Taylor?",
    "fullText": "Ask columnist Jason Williams anything − sports or non-sports – and he’ll pick some of your questions and comments from his inbox and respond on Cincinnati.com. Email: jwilliams@enquirer.com\n\nMessage: John Harbaugh won a Super Bowl in Baltimore. He won eight road playoff games over 18 seasons there, something no other coach has done. He still got fired.\n\nSean McDermott made Buffalo a regular contender in the AFC, at one point going six straight seasons of winning at least one playoff game. He still got fired.\n\nAnd yet Zac Taylor remains the Bengals’ head coach after missing the playoffs three straight years. Don’t you think all these firings of top coaches makes the Bengals look even worse for keeping Zac?\n\nReply: Guess it depends on the audience. It looks bad to the national media, which can’t accept that the Bengals aren’t like everyone else in how they operate. Here at home, we’re conditioned to accept Bengals mediocrity and so most people don’t think it looks all that bad.\n\nBig picture, the moves in Baltimore and Buffalo highlight that the Bengals’ standards aren’t congruent with the AFC’s elite franchises. You already knew that, but it’s just another reminder that some teams have a whole other level of expectations – a level that’s hard to comprehend around here.\n\nBaltimore and Buffalo are legitimately trying to win a Super Bowl. Meanwhile, Bengals ownership is happy if the team is competitive and finishes with a winning record. Did you notice that Bengals owner Mike Brown pointed out the “four straight winning seasons” in the first sentence of his statement early this month? Well, two of those ended with no playoff berth.\n\nThat said, I’m glad Taylor didn’t get fired. The team’s failures aren’t his fault. Taylor can only do so much with the inadequate players that ownership and the front office keep giving him.\n\nAnd there is something to be said about being patient with a coach. It’s a tough balancing act, but Taylor did oversee the best two-year stretch in team history – and it wasn’t that long ago.\n\nThe notion of firing a coach after one bad season is crazy, like the Ravens did with Harbaugh. On one hand, you like the message that mediocrity won’t cut it. On the other, though, it’s a cautionary tale to be careful what you wish for. It’ll be incredibly difficult for new Baltimore coach Jesse Minter to match Harbaugh’s success, let alone top it.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Baltimore, Buffalo go for Super Bowl excellence as Bengals stay same",

    "fullText": "There are just four NFL teams remaining in postseason play, with four former UNC football standouts scattered across those rosters. One Tar Heel in particular, though, is MVP contender Drake Maye.\n\nA quarterback who starred at North Carolina from 2021-2023, Maye is anchoring the New England Patriots' most successful season since Bill Belichick's head coaching days. Maye has his team in its first AFC Championship game since 2019, when New England won its most recent Super Bowl Title.\n\nOn Thursday, Maye earned some well-deserved recognition for his breakout campaign, earning one of the AP's five finalist nominations for NFL MVP.\n\nJoining Maye in this exclusive group are San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey, Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence and Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, the last of whom is widely considered the MVP frontrunner.\n\nMaye has a golden chance to deliver his MVP-clinching moment on Sunday, with the Patriots traveling to face the Denver Broncos in a cold, 3 p.m. ET AFC Championship clash.\n\nOne step closer. 👟\n\nThe Real MVP. @DrakeMaye2 pic.twitter.com/AJSnZElrPm\n\n— Carolina Football (@UNCFootball) January 22, 2026\n\nBias aside, Maye makes an extremely strong case to win MVP in his \"Sophomore\" NFL season. Maye's 4,394 passing yards are fourth amongst quarterbacks in the regular season, his 31 passing touchdowns are third and his 77.1 QBR led the NFL.\n\nMaye also compiled 450 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns in regular season action, showcasing the same dual-threat ability he did as a Tar Heel.\n\nDespite five turnovers in the postseason, Maye is playing solid football in leading New England one win from the Super Bowl. Maye completed 33 of his first 56 passes for 447 yards and four touchdowns, while adding 76 rushing yards on 14 carries.\n\nIf Maye takes better care of the football on Sunday and his offensive line holds up, Maye will have no issue putting an exclamation point on his case for NFL MVP.\n\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on. Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: Drake Maye tabbed a finalist for 2025 AP NFL MVP award",

    "description": "A look at 20 free agents who have played for a defense with Parker as a coach, and how each performed in 2025.",
    "fullText": "One of the oldest tenets in the NFL is that players tend to follow the coaches who have had positive impacts on their development. With Christian Parker in line to become the next Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator, and with his glowing reputation as a teacher and tactician, it is fair to wonder which former players could be joining him in Dallas.\n\nFans know, the club is in dire need of additional defensive talent. And while Parker is moving up to playcaller for the first time in his career, his relationships with players doesn't necessarily have to be limited to secondary players just because he was the defensive passing game coordinator. There could absolutely be linebackers who have been involved in those meetings who are interested in working for the 34-year old under the bright lights in Dallas.\n\nThe first glimpse is to who are pending free agents within the Philadelphia Eagles organization but things don't stop there. Parker also coached with the Denver Broncos from 2021 through 2023, and players from that era could still easily be able to contribute in 2026.\n\nUnfortunately for the Cowboys, the players who likely have most benefitted from Parker's tutelage are either still under their rookie deals with the Eagles, or have signed on long-term with their team.\n\nPatrick Surtain II: First-team All-Pro\nQuinyon Mitchell: First-team All-Pro\nCooper DeJean: First-team All-Pro\n\n... and all before Christian Parker turns 35. \n\nwelcome to the #Cowboys, sir. https://t.co/vmUEdicnZM\n\n— Patrik [No C] Walker (@VoiceOfTheStar) January 22, 2026\n\nHere's a rundown of the top potential free agents who could now be in the mix in Dallas, tiered by their 2025 Pro Football Focus overall defensive grades.\n\nCB Ja'Quan McMillian (RFA), Denver, 2022-23, 80.3 grade in 2025\n\nMcMillian is a former UDFA who has been a staple in the Denver secondary. They will most likely slap him with a 1st round or 2nd round tender, taking him off the market.\n\nSafety Avonte Maddox, Detroit, 2024, 79.1 grade in 2025\n\nMaddox had an incredible single season in Detroit, but didn't fare as well in Philly. He had a 61.9 overall grade in his one season working with Parker.\n\nSafety CJ Gardner-Johnson, Philadelphia, 2024, 51.4 grade in 2025\n\nNot a great year for Gardner-Johnson in Chicago, but he did have a 77.0 grade w/ Parker in 2024.\n\nLB Justin Strnad, Denver, 2021-23, 72.1 grade in 2025\n\nStrnad barely played while Parker was in Denver, but that doesn't mean they didn't have a chance to form some level of working relationship. Now that he's getting, he's an intriguing option for the Cowboys to fill out their linebacker core with.\n\nCB Fabian Moreau, Minnesota, 2023, 71.4\n\nMoreau has a strong grade, but only played 198 snaps in 2025 as a reserve. Could definitely be added as a depth piece to help round out the roster if Parker liked what he saw their one year together in 2023; Moreau graded out at 62.4 on 739 snaps.\n\nLB Alex Singleton, Denver, 2022-23, 70.1\n\nSingle had a strong first year in Denver with Parker in 2022, his highest graded of his six seasons at 79.1.\n\nSafety PJ Locke, Denver, 2021-23, 63.0\n\nNothing much stands out with Locke, who has mostly been a reserve, but he did have 3 sacks on 11 pash rush snaps in 2023 with Parker.\n\nLB Nakobe Dean, Philadelphia, 2024-25, 62.2\n\nDean has generally been regarded as a bust with the Eagles, but when he got starter snaps through the year in 2024 with Parker, he had a 77.4 grade, including a strong year in both run defense and pass rush.\n\nThose aren't the only back-seven players who are on the free agent market this year, but they are the ones who turned in average-or-better performances. Here's a look at other free agent linebackers, cornerbacks and safeties with ties to Parker.\n\nCB Adoree' Jackson, Philadelphia, 2025, 53.6 grade in 2025\n\nSafety Marcus Epps, Philadelphia, 2025, 51.8 grade in 2025\n\nSafety Reed Blankenship, Philadelphia, 2024-25, 42.6 grade in 2025\n\nLB Ben Van Sumeren (RFA), Philadelphia, 2024-25, N/A\n\nLB Josey Jewell, Out of League, 2021-23\n\nSafety Justin Simmons, Out of League, 2021-23\n\nSafety Kareem Jackson, Out of the League, 2021-22\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cowboys Wire: Eagles, NFL free agents who may follow DC Christian Parker to Cowboys",
